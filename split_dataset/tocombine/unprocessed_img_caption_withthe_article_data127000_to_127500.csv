It's purposely taped to the inside of my kitchen cabinet, so I see it every morning. It reads, ""Accept a child for who he is and watch him blossom."" I found it 15 years ago in a Christian parenting magazine and the morning I found it, it was like receiving manna from heaven.I had a 24/7 wild ride of a 3-year-old little boy at the time, and I was in the midst of trying to tame him into being like everyone else's mellow child in the neighborhood play group. I loved this little boy beyond words, but he was always at the root of any wrestling or physical tussle with other kids. He loved to hug his friends and during the 90 minutes of social interaction that I looked forward to every week, I only spent three minutes, tops, in talking to other moms. My days back then were solitary days, spent watching Teletubbies and chatting away in three-word-sentences to a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old. I craved the company of a friend, and I looked forward to my Wednesday morning gathering. But my son was a physical boy, and he would climb, jump, crawl, and run. He couldn't sit still. There wasn't a morning that I didn't leave the play group on the verge of tears because my child couldn't sit and play without my constant supervision. I wanted to be able to talk to others without having to run interference between my son and the other kids or run to his rescue because he had fallen. Again. I remember one morning, his constant energy was becoming more than I could take. I drove home, crying. My sweet boy said, ""Mama sad. Mama cry."" ""Yes, mama sad mama cry,"" I answered. Why couldn't he behave like the other kids? When we got home that day, I carried him out of his car seat; kissing him, my tears fell on top of his warm, wonderful head. ""I love you, baby,"" I told him, ""but mama needs you to be good."" ""I be good, mama, I be good boy!"" His earnestness broke my heart. He went quietly down for a late morning nap, and I brought the mail in. As I put my feet up, I thought about how if I could only get this boy to be like the other kids who behaved, I'd be happier. Later that afternoon, I brought in the day's mail and began to page through the parenting magazine that had arrived. My heart stopped when I read the tagline on an article regarding toddlers, underneath the tagline was the quote I've saved for the past 15 years. I cried as I read the words over and over, ""Accept a child for who he is and watch him blossom.""I had it all wrong. I needed to accept him, not make him into something he wasn't. He was a joyful, high energy child, and I needed to let him feel happy about being himself. I cut out the quote and we quit the play group. Instead of me trying to fit him into a mold that he didn't come from, we instead began spending our Wednesday mornings at the park... running free, laughing loud, and climbing to his heart's content.I will always remember the morning I came across these words because they changed my world. Today, this child of the rambunctious need to move and do, leaves for college in a few months. I get melancholy when I think of the foolish years I wasted trying to be like the other moms and have him be like the other kids. My boy is still an intense presence, pursuing what he's interested in with an energy and a zeal that's contagious. He loves me, and tells me often. ""You're a great mom, I love you,"" are words that he's not shy to speak. I feel his confidence and his happiness in being who he is. He genuinely likes himself. How could I ever have thought I had to tame this? He was and is, focused and tireless, hindsight has shown me that. He hasn't changed much from the days when we attended play group together, despite my sad early efforts at trying to change him. If I could have my days back with this wonderful boy, it would be to do it this way: let HIM be. I would stop comparing myself, and him, to others. I would forget what the other moms nodded and whispered about. I would have been happy being alone with him, surrendering myself to his sticky hugs and intentional kisses. I would have smiled, not cried, during the days of play groups, and I would have beamed at my child and said, ""Isn't it wonderful? How excited and happy he is? I am so lucky.""I am forever grateful for writers, because that magazine article was read by just the mom and child who needed it at that moment. Words are powerful because you don't know who is going to read them. The author of that article with the quote I've saved for over 15 years has no idea she changed our lives that day. And she doesn't have to know, because what matters, is that her words fell on the right ears."
1,WELLNESS,E-Cigarette Use Doubles Among U.S. Teens -- But What's The Connection With Cigarette Smoking?,Anna Almendrala,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/e-cigarette-use-teens_us_5b9de9e7e4b03a1dcc8e9c9b,"The study is cross-sectional, which means that it cannot show that vaping caused smoking, or vice versa. Despite that limitation",2014-03-06,"Kathleene, an electronic cigarette store employee, smokes an electronic cigarette in Paris, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2013. The European Parliament voted to impose warning labels covering 65 percent of cigarette packs, rejecting a measure for blank packaging instead. Legislators also voted for new limits on advertising for electronic cigarettes, but rejected a measure that would have restricted them to medical use only. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9de9e7250000350036a413.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Electronic cigarettes exist in a limbo world of laws, even as use of the battery-powered nicotine vaporizer grows across the nation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to regulate e-cigarettes the way it does cigarettes or tobacco, leaving states and cities to come up with their own ordinances on how to restrict their sale and use.Los Angeles is the most recent city to ban the use of e-cigarettes (or ""vaping"") in public places. The councilmembers who voted on the law lamented the lack of scientific evidence for two seemingly opposing claims: that e-cigarettes can either help smokers quit their cigarette addiction, and that e-cigarettes are essentially a gateway for teens to cigarette smoking.But evidence on these claims is slowly emerging. A study published today (March 6) in JAMA Pediatrics shows that e-cigarette use has doubled among teens between 2011 and 2012, with 3.1 percent of teens saying they had ever tried an e-cigarette and 1.1 percent being current e-cigarette users in 2011, compared with 6.5 percent of teens ever trying an e-cigarette and 2 percent of teens being current users in 2012. The study also establishes a link between vaping and smoking; teens who smoked e-cigarettes (even just once) were more likely to have experimented with conventional cigarettes.The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute and surveyed tens of thousands of middle and high school students; 17,323 in 2011 and 22,529 in 2012. It's the first study to examine e-cigarette use and tobacco cigarette use in teens at the same time, and its also one of the few studies that uses a nationally representative sample. The study also provided some insights on e-cigarettes supposed role in quitting smoking. ""We saw that kids who used e-cigarettes were less likely to have stopped smoking and were more likely to be planning to quit,"" said lead researcher Lauren Dutra, ScD, a postdoctoral scholar at the UCSF Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education. Dutra argues that this finding challenges the e-cigarette industry's claims that vaping could lead to quitting.The study is cross-sectional, which means that it cannot show that vaping caused smoking, or vice versa. Despite that limitation, Dutra and co-author Stanton Glantz, Ph.D., write that their study suggests e-cigarettes are not discouraging the use of conventional cigarettes, and that they could actually contribute to nicotine addiction. But David Abrams, Ph.D., the executive director of the Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at the anti-smoking advocacy group Legacy, disputes Dutra's conclusion and says the study doesn't hold up. ""We need balance and the rationality of science to dominate over biased ideology,"" Abrams said to The Huffington Post. ""There is absolutely no evidence that using e-cigarettes makes [teens] more likely to use cigarettes."" The problem with Dutra's conclusion, said Abrams, is that causality could run the other way; kids who smoke (because of genetics, or parents who smoke) could simply be more likely to engage in other risky behaviors as well, such as alcohol, marijuana or e-cigarettes. ""One does not lead to the other [in this study],"" said Abrams. ""The behaviors just travel together in vulnerable kids."" The only way to establish causality is a rigorous longitudinal study that follows a large number of people over a long period of time -- something that would take decades. In the mean time, said Abrams, ""the science doesn't support panic or fear [of e-cigarettes] -- yet.""Best known for its ""Truth Campaign"" ads, Legacy's vision is a society free of the death and disease caused by tobacco. And according to Abrams, e-cigarettes could be the key to achieving that society. ""They are the first product in 100 years that might make cigarettes obsolete,"" said Abrams. ""That would literally wipe out the death cause to 5.6 million kids alive today, as well as 480,000 adults every year.""To be clear, Abrams isn't pro-vaping; it's just that absent any data that proves using e-cigarettes lead to tobacco cigarette addiction, a known killer, he's reluctant to label them bad and dangerous. (However, it should be noted that in 2009, the FDA found toxic chemicals in leading e-cigarette brands.) Like Dutra, Abrams supports the FDA regulation of e-cigarettes, as well as a ban on vaping in public places and sales and marketing targeted at minors. Even Smoke Free Alternatives Trade Association, an e-cigarettes trade organization, agrees that the devices should not be marketed to minors. ""[E-cigarettes] should not be targeted to kids in any shape or form, and no kid should be exposed or easily able to use any nicotine or tobacco product, including e-cigarettes,"" said Abrams. As for the teens surveyed in Dutra's study, Abrams says it's no surprise that there are a few teens who will always find ways to use a variety of tobacco products, despite the laws in place. Dutra doesn't deny that a longitudinal study is needed to truly assess causation, but she did point out that her study also found that 20 percent of the middle schoolers who had used e-cigarettes had never tried a tobacco cigarette. For high schoolers, that number was 7 percent. JAMA Pediatrics published an editorial alongside Dutra's study, and it points out that her findings highlight both exciting and discouraging possibilities for e-cigarettes and their potential to make people want to quit smoking. However, empirical data on the success of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool is ""mixed at best"" so far, writes health economist Frank Chaloupka, Ph.D. of the University of Illinois at Chicago. Instead, he writes, the high use of both e-cigarettes and cigarettes among smokers suggests that they're simply vaping to get their hit of nicotine in places where they aren't allowed to smoke. But if the nationwide trend of banning e-cigarette use in public places continues to pick up steam, vapers will soon have to resort to puffing away outside the club, along with the smokers.  "

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall opened the shop which will sell products including fruit and vegetables from the gardens of their Highgrove estate and profits will be ploughed into the Prince's Charities Foundation. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dea6d2600003500800e48.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The parsnip is a taproot in the carrot family. A poisonous cousin grows wild in Eurasia, but the sweet parsnip we know is a Mediterranean vegetable that was familiar to the Greeks and Romans. Parsnips were an important staple all over Europe before that conquering starch, the potato, arrived from the New World. Sadly, the colonists did not eat the parsnip with the same enthusiasm, and it is still under-appreciated in America, although in Jamestown, in the early seventeenth century, the settlers made a wedding cake with parsnip flour.Parsnips are first dug in late September, then stored in root cellars. They can also be left in the ground, where they keep well until February or March. They are sweeter after a light frost, which converts some of the starch to sugar.A tender parsnip is two to three inches across. Large roots have a tough core and woody texture. Tender and True, a Victorian variety with a long root, and White Gem, a shorter one, have the best flavor. Parsnips are rich in potassium, folic acid, and vitamin B6.Do not peel parsnips. The skin is thin, and positively delicious when roasted. Try not to boil them either, unless you are making purée or glazed parsnips. They get soggy in water. They are better roasted or sautéed, which removes water and concentrates the sugars. Sautéing takes patience, and the parsnips must be cut into small pieces. Parsnips are good glazed. Put them in a wide, shallow pan with butter, honey, salt and just enough water to cover them -- or apple juice, if you have a sweet tooth. Cover the pan and bring it to the boil, then remove the lid and reduce until the liquid is dark and thick.Parsnips go well with nutmeg, cream, Jerusalem artichokes and leeks.As with all vegetables, the trick to perfect doneness lies in cutting the parsnips into even pieces. My method: Cut the root in thirds cross-wise, so you have a thin, medium and thick piece. Set each piece on its end, like a stump, and cut downward, in sticks of equal thickness. You will get more sticks from the thick piece, and just a couple from the thin end, but they will all be the same size.SEASON:Dug in late September, early October. From storage (or the ground) until March.WHAT TO LOOK FOR:Firm, heavy for their size. An old parsnip is light and spongy. Uneven skin is fine, but avoid spots of rot.STORAGE:In the fridge or as cool as 32°F for several weeks. Or let the farmer store them!MAKING THE MOST OF A SURPLUS:Purée is convenient and freezes well.STEWED SHOULDER OF LAMB WITH PARSNIPS AND PEARS:The shoulder is the sweetest cut. Here it is stewed until it is falling off the bone with sweet flavors: pink peppercorns, parsnips, and pears. Fresh bay leaves right off the plant are more pungent than dried.SERVES 6-81 shoulder of lamb, about 4 lbs 6 tbsp olive oil for braising 4 large leeks, trimmed, washed and sliced 4 fresh bay leaves 1 tbsp pink peppercorns, crushed 1 cup rosé 1 cup lamb or vegetable stock 2 cups parsnips 2 firm pears, such as ConcordHeat half of the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan with a tight lid. Brown the lamb well, about 5-7 minutes on each side. Do not let the oil smoke or the meat burn.Remove the lamb from the pan, discard the fat, wipe the pan, then heat the remaining olive oil gently.Add the leeks, bay leaves and pink peppercorns. When the leeks begin to soften, add the wine and stock.Set the lamb on top of the leeks, baste and cover. Cook for at least 3 and probably 4 hours on the lowest heat, until the meat is very tender. If the lid is not tight-fitting, weigh it down. Baste once or twice during the cooking time but don't leave the lid off: the lamb is partly poaching, partly steaming. A low oven or slow-cooker also works well.About an hour before the lamb is finished, wash and cut the parsnips and pears in bite-sized pieces. Do not peel.Add parsnips and pears, turn the meat, and cook until parsnips are soft.Check for salt and add more pink pepper to taste.Carve the lamb, and serve it with a few spoonfuls of vegetables and some stock, in a bowl on its own or over rice.This is even tastier the next day. After seasoning, store it in a cool pantry or the fridge. Lamb is rich: when the fat has risen and congealed, lift it out and discard it. Reheat and serve.SMOKED HADDOCK AND PARSNIP FISHCAKES:If you do not use smoked fish, add 1 tsp anchovy essence or fish sauce before forming the cakes. Or salt to taste.MAKES 8-10 cakes2 cups parsnips, peeled and chopped 2 tbsp butter 1 lb un-dyed smoked haddock 1½ cup milk 1 tsp turmeric 1-2 eggs 2 tbsp chives, chopped mixture of flour and fine polenta for dusting vegetable or light olive oil for frying Aïoli to garnish (see Basic Recipes)Boil the parsnips in salted water. Drain and mash lightly, mixing in the butter.Heat the haddock in the milk and turmeric until simmering point, then remove from heat and drain. Remove the skin and flake the fish.Beat 1 egg and mix it with the fish, chives, and plenty of fresh black pepper.Gently mix the parsnips and fish. Flour your hands and form cakes about 1 inch thick and 2-3 inches across. They can be refrigerated for several hours.If the fishcakes are moist, pat them on all sides with the flour and polenta. If they are dry, brush them with the second beaten egg, and then dust them with the flour and polenta.Heat enough oil in a heavy pan to brown the fishcakes half-way up each side. Fry each side for 3-4 minutes, until crisp. Drain on kitchen paper and serve hot with Aïoli.Variation: Mix 1 tsp each of ground cayenne and turmeric into the flour and polenta mixture.ROASTED PARSNIPS WITH HONEY:Roasted vegetables are easy and delectable. Try any simple combination of carrots, parsnips, rutabaga, beets, potatoes, or winter squash, cut into cubes or fat matchsticks, with a fresh herb.SERVES 2-41 lb parsnips (about 3 large), cut as described in the parsnips introduction 2 shallots, finely chopped 2 tsp olive oil freshly grated nutmeg 1 tsp honeySet the oven to 420°F.Mix the parsnips and shallots together with the olive oil in a baking tin. Sprinkle some salt and grate fresh nutmeg over them.Spread them evenly in not more than two layers and bake until the edges are brown and they begin to stick, about 10 minutes. Set the timer, or you may burn them.Shake the pan, stir in the honey, reduce the heat to 350°F, and cook until tender, about 15-20 minutes. Shake the pan occasionally to prevent sticking.  PARSNIP PURÉE:SERVES 2-41½ lbs parsnips, chopped ½ lb potatoes, peeled and chopped 1 large yellow onion, chopped ½ tsp salt 1 sprig rosemary, leaves chopped roughly 2 bay leaves 2 tsp olive oilPut all the ingredients except the oil into a saucepan with some water, bring it to a boil and cook until vegetables are soft. Drain, reserving a little water.Purée with the oil, thinning to taste with the reserved cooking water. Season with salt and pepper.Variations: Cook a Bramley apple, peeled and quartered, with the parsnips and potatoes.From The Farmers' Market Cookbook by Nina Planck, [Kindle Edition], Diversion Books, September, 2013.

But measures to restrict electronic cigarettes -- sales of which have increased 100-fold in just the last few years -- seem to be moving a bit faster, with another major city moving to ban use of the devices in public places. Los Angeles is the latest to restrict the use of e-cigarettes in public places, with the LA City Council voting 12-0 on Tuesday to ban the use of the devices in restaurants, workplaces and parks (places where smoking is already banned by law). The ban is expected to be signed into law by Mayor Eric Garcetti in a few days, reports Reuters. Los Angeles follows in the footsteps of New York City, Washington D.C., Chicago, and Boston, as well as five states, that have restricted vaping in some way. LA's ban, however, will allow people to use e-cigarettes in vapor lounges, vapor stores and theatrical performances. Electronic cigarettes are battery-operated and contain no tobacco, but they do still contain some harmful chemicals and nicotine. The nicotine is heated in the device and ""vaped."" The Los Angeles Times reports that the debate before the vote was both personal and emotional, with several councilmembers opening up about their personal struggle with cigarette addiction. Councilman Mitch O'Farrell, a co-sponsor of the ordinance, talked about being forced to breathe secondhand smoke when he worked as a waiter in a restaurant, while Councilwoman Nury Martinez revealed that her husband has not been able to quit his cigarette habit.LA Council President Herb Wesson was arguably the strongest advocate for the ban. The 62-year-old councilman admitted that he had started smoking when he was 20 years old to look ""cool,"" and that he was now ""the council's No. 1 smoker,"" reports the Times. More of Wesson's comments, from the LA Times: ""I'm telling you, the high percentage of kids that smoke, smoke because it's cool. And when you're 15 you want to be cool,"" he said. ""I will not support anything -- anything -- that might attract one new smoker.""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to regulate the e-cigarette industry, and advocates say that vaping isn't as harmful as smoking -- and can in fact even help people quit tobacco cigarettes. But Legacy, a research non-profit focusing on the effects of tobacco use, says important questions about e-cigarette use among minors and smokers' ""dual use"" of tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes have yet to be answered. It's clear that in the face of scientific ambiguity, LA's City Council members would rather be safe than sorry. ""It's important that until we can establish that e-cigarette use is safe, we must err on the on the side of caution,"" said LA City Attorney Mike Feuer, who also collaborated on crafting LA's vaping ordinance.The ban enjoyed support from the Public Health Officer for the County of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the American Lung Association, the American Heart Association, and the American Cancer Society, according to a release from O'Farrell's office.
