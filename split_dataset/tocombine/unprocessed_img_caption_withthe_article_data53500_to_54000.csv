(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dustin VolzWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican-backed proposal in the Senate to expand the FBI's secretive surveillance powers after the mass shooting at an Orlando gay nightclub last week fell two votes short on Wednesday of the 60 needed to advance.The measure was a Republican response to the massacre after a push for gun-control measures sponsored by both major U.S. parties failed earlier this week.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell switched his vote to 'no' at the end of the unusually long hour vote to allow him the opportunity to bring it up for consideration again.The legislation would broaden the type of telephone and internet records the Federal Bureau of Investigation could request from companies such as the Google unit of Alphabet Inc and Verizon Communications Inc without a warrant. Opponents said it threatened civil liberties and did little to improve national security.The bill, which the Obama administration has sought for years, “will allow the FBI to collect the dots so they can connect the dots, and that’s been the biggest problem that they’ve had in identifying these homegrown, radicalized terrorists,” Senator John Cornyn, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican, said on Tuesday.The vote was seen as reflective of a bipartisan drift away from policy positions that favored digital privacy, which had taken hold in the three years since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed the breadth of government surveillance programs.The post-Snowden moves included the most substantial reforms to the U.S. intelligence community since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and a refusal to heed the FBI’s call for laws that would undermine encryption.The future of the Senate proposal in the House of Representatives was uncertain, given its alliance between libertarian-leaning Republicans and tech-friendly Democrats that has blocked past efforts to expand surveillance.The legislation before the Senate on Wednesday, filed as an amendment to a criminal justice funding bill, would widen the FBI’s authority to use so-called National Security Letters, which do not require a warrant and whose very existence is usually a secret.Such letters can compel a company to hand over a user's phone billing records. Under the Senate's change, the FBI would be able to demand electronic communications transaction records such as time stamps of emails and the emails' senders and recipients, in addition to some information about websites a person visitsThe legislation would also make permanent a provision of the USA Patriot Act that lets the intelligence community conduct surveillance on “lone wolf” suspects who do not have confirmed ties to a foreign terrorist group. That provision, which the Justice Department said last year had never been used, expires in December 2019.'KNEE-JERK SOLUTIONS’Privacy groups and civil liberties advocates accused Republicans this week of exploiting the Orlando shooting to build support for unrelated legislation.Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, criticized Senate Republicans for “pushing fake, knee-jerk solutions that will do nothing to prevent mass shootings or terrorist attacks.”Though Republicans invoked the Orlando shooting in support of the bill, FBI Director James Comey has said Mateen’s transactional records were fully reviewed by authorities who investigated him twice for possible extremist ties.Comey said there was “no indication” Mateen belonged to any extremist group and that it was unlikely authorities could have done anything differently to prevent the attack.(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Andrew Hay and Steve Orlofsky)"

U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl on Tuesday agreed, ruling that the federal agency's claim that it had ""implicit"" congressional authority for the regulations ""lacks common sense.""""Congress has not delegated to the Department of Interior the authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing,"" Skavdahl wrote in a 27-page order. ""The BLM's effort to do so through the Fracking Rule is in excess of its statutory authority and contrary to law.""That language seemed to be a direct rebuke to the Obama administration, which touted the fracking rule last year as ""commonsense"" while noting that states and localities should fill in the gaps it left open. The government received more than 1 million public comments during the rule-making process.The rule sets standards on well construction and wastewater storage, among other requirements. But Skavdahl said the government's policy intentions were irrelevant to the question of what power it had to promulgate them in the first place.""Congress’ inability or unwillingness to pass a law desired by the executive branch does not default authority to the executive branch to act independently, regardless of whether hydraulic fracturing is good or bad for the environment or the Citizens of the United States,"" he wrote.The judge had already put the rule on hold twice last year while the litigation proceeded, giving other states, industry and environmental groups a chance to pick sides in the dispute and offer their arguments as the case moved forward. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit is presently considering an appeal of one of these earlier orders, and a second appeal of Tuesday's ruling is also likely.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has opposed the Obama administration in court on immigration and funding for the Affordable Care Act, among other issues, lauded Skavdahl for defending ""the energy revolution from the heavy hand of big government.""""Only Congress can write laws. Agencies acting without authority from Congress is simply illegal,"" Ryan said in a statement, while noting that fracking helped to keep energy prices low and create jobs.Citing the appeals process, the Department of the Interior declined to comment on the ruling but obliquely lamented the decision.""While we defer more comment due to pending litigation, the BLMs modernized fracking requirements reflect today's industry practices and are aimed at ensuring adequate well control, preventing groundwater contamination, and increasing transparency about the materials used in the fracturing process,"" said a department spokesperson.""It's unfortunate that implementation of the rule continues to be delayed because it prevents regulators from using 21st century standards to ensure that oil and gas operations are conducted safely and responsibly on public and tribal lands,"" the official added.The White House did not respond to a request for comment, but Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, wrote in a White House blog last year that the fracking rules only marked the beginning of a process that, in the end, rested with the states and the business sector.""The majority of oil and gas development remains on state and private lands,"" Jewell wrote. ""So, the responsibility for developing this energy safely must now be taken up in state capitals, engineering labs, and boardrooms all across the country."""

Pat McCrory continues to defend the state's sweeping anti-LGBT law despite public outrage and political backlash, going as far as to mock Bruce Springsteen after the musician canceled a concert in protest.When a school system in Charlotte on Monday announced a new bathroom policy that flies in the face of the controversial law by allowing students to identify as whatever gender they choose, the governor's office couldn't help but fire back.A spokesman for McCrory, in a statement on Tuesday, accused Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools of defying transparency and ""purposely breaking state law.""Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, a district that includes more than 146,000 K-12 students in 168​​ schools, on Monday adopted an updated policy that it says follows a federal court ruling and will better protect transgender students, The Charlotte Observer reports. In addition to allowing students to select the gender and name by which they want to identify, the policy requires that schools honor that identity in restrooms, locker rooms, yearbooks and graduation ceremonies.""This is about courage, understanding and compassion,"" Superintendent Ann Clark told the newspaper. ""These are our children. These are the community’s children.""Passed in March, North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2 removes legal anti-discrimination protection for LGBTQ people and mandates that individuals use the public bathrooms that correspond to the sex they were assigned at birth. It faces a legal challenge from the U.S. Department of Justice.George Battle III, an attorney for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, said during a news conference that the updated policy is not meant to defy House Bill 2, according to The Charlotte Observer. Instead, it follows an April ruling by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals which Battle said requires that trans students ""be given access to the restroom, locker room [and] changing room facilities of the gender for which they self-identify.""""That’s the law of the land for five states that are in the 4th Circuit, North Carolina being one of those states,” Battle said. ""This isn't CMS making a stand against HB2.""Predictably, McCrory saw things differently.""Instead of providing reasonable accommodations for some students facing unique circumstances,"" the school district ""made a radical change to their shower, locker room and restroom policy for all students,"" Graham Wilson, the governor's press secretary, said. ""This curiously-timed announcement that changes the basic expectations of privacy for students comes just after school let out and defies transparency, especially for parents,"" Wilson said in a statement. ""The Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System should have waited for the courts to make a decision instead of purposely breaking state law.""The school district's new policy is slated to take effect when classes resume in August.""You have to accept them for what they are,"" Kelly Hagemann, a school district parent, told WSOC-TV. ""We're maybe not going to understand everything about it, but we can't really alienate people.""Late last month, University of North Carolina System President Margaret Spellings wrote she had “no intent” to enforce the anti-trans bathroom law."
3,MEDIA,Donald Trump's Campaign Finally Lets BuzzFeed Into An Event,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-campaign-buzzfeed-media-blacklist_us_576ac0bae4b0c0252e77f6be,"But the Washington Post, another member of the media blacklist, is left outside.",2016-06-22,The Trump campaign allowed BuzzFeed into an event for the first time this election season. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576ac9441500002b0073bf37.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- It isn't usually big news for a news organization to attend a speech given by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But Wednesday marked the first time this election cycle that Donald Trump's campaign officially granted BuzzFeed News access to cover one of his events. The Trump campaign has denied press credentials to numerous outlets in response to what it considers unfair coverage, including The Huffington Post, Politico, The Daily Beast, Univision, Fusion, The Des Moines Register, The Union Leader, Mother Jones, National Review and most recently The Washington Post. Journalists receiving credentials at times have also faced restrictions on their ability to report inside events. BuzzFeed's McKay Coppins wrote Wednesday that he, along with journalists from outlets such as Slate, Gawker and Rolling Stone, was initially stopped by security at the Trump Soho hotel prior to the candidate's speech aimed squarely at presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. After security tried escorting out the reporters, Coppins described how campaign press secretary Hope Hicks intervened and offered to find space for the journalists. The group entered the event soon after. Hicks declined to comment.The decision to allow BuzzFeed inside, a move coming days after the firing of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, an operative renowned for his hostile dealings with journalists, could be seen as a thaw in the relationship between the Trump campaign and the press. But the media blacklist doesn't appear to have been universally relaxed. The Washington Post's Lois Romano and Jose DelReal were not allowed inside the same event, Romano tweeted Wednesday.The Washington Post's Paul Farhi wrote Monday that the campaign's restrictions on supposedly banned outlets ""are often arbitrarily enforced and vaguely defined."" Though Trump announced on Facebook that the Post would be banned from receiving press credentials over a specific headline, the campaign hasn't made similar public pronouncements when other outlets, like BuzzFeed, found themselves cut off. Coppins wrote a critical profile of Trump in 2014 and predicted, like many politics watchers, that the reality TV star would never actually run for president. But the Trump campaign hasn't explicitly given a reason why BuzzFeed was put on the blacklist throughout the 2016 cycle -- a question the site's Washington bureau chief, John Stanton, unsuccessfully tried getting answered in a video posted Tuesday. Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Susan Collins (R-Maine), unveiled a bill Tuesday that they think can unite people within the gun debate. It would ban firearm sales to the 81,000 people on the Transportation Security Administration's no-fly list, as well as another 28,000 ""selectees"" who can fly but are subject to extra screening.The day before, the Senate had failed to pass any measure to deal with gun violence despite the Orlando, Florida, massacre in which a man who pledged allegiance to ISIS shot and killed 49 people in a gay nightclub. Instead, the lawmakers spent Monday voting down bills that would have tightened background checks on weapon sales and blocked people on all terrorist watch lists -- there are many -- from buying guns.Nearly all Republicans opposed those measures, as did a couple of Democrats. Even lawmakers who voted no, however, realize that most Americans don't understand why the country should sell high-powered weapons to potential terrorists.Enter Collins' compromise bill. Since it only targets people on two watch lists, it eases some GOP concerns about Americans who erroneously end up on such lists being denied their constitutional right to possess a gun. Democrats like the proposal because it's doing something to curb gun violence.But the vast majority of people covered by the bill are foreigners. Approximately 2,700 of the individuals on those two lists are Americans, which is about as many as could fit into a suburban high school.The legislation also would have had no effect on recent mass shootings, since even in the two cases of killers who had pledged allegiance to ISIS -- Orlando and San Bernardino, California -- they were not on the terrorist watch lists. And, of course, the Americans who are targeted by the bill could still buy weapons without background checks from some individuals at gun shows and in certain types of internet sales.Yet such are the standards on Capitol Hill that just the announcement of this tiny, fractional step was greeted by many as a breakthrough.""It's a great bipartisan proposal,"" said Sen.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a co-sponsor, said that could happen.But his colleague, Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), was less sanguine. ""They don't have that today,"" he said with a laugh, when told of the Democrats' estimate.There's also the question of whether the bill, if it passed the Senate, would get a vote in the House. A spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) punted the question to Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). A senior GOP leadership aide in McCarthy's office said only that it's ""premature to say.""White House press secretary Josh Earnest suggested that President Barack Obama may support Collins' proposal, but said it's too early to tell.""We're still assessing exactly how narrow it is and determining what kind of impact it actually would have,"" Earnest said in his daily briefing. ""If we conclude that it would have a positive impact and at least prevent some suspected terrorists from being able to buy a gun, then it seems likely it's something the administration would be able to support.""For now, though, it's up to the Senate to get moving on the bill. Collins said she expects a vote as soon as this week.Asked what he thinks will happen, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said gun control measures have long failed in the Senate, so he doesn't expect the latest push to be any different.""This is one of those issues that is pretty cut and dried,"" he said. ""I'm saying that people's views on this haven't changed much. It's just the way it is.""Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting."

""She appreciates that it is essential to maintain our strong military advantage, but that force must be used as a last resort.""He also praised Clinton's judgement -- something that has been repeatedly questioned by her presidential rivals.""The presidency requires the judgement and the knowledge to make tough calls under pressure. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, assembled a global coalition to impose a sanctions regime on Iran, and played a crucial role in persuading Iran to accept limits on its nuclear program.""Scowcroft's endorsement follows that of Richard Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state to George W.

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marc-benioff-how-to-defeat-donald-trump_us_576ae4bfe4b065534f48a21e,Taking the high road.,2016-06-22,"Salesforce chairman and chief executive Marc Benioff, seen here with Hillary Clinton in 2014 at his company's Dreamforce conference.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576ae6291500002b0073bf9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“What are we going to do about Trump?” That’s a question Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff gets a lot these days from other CEOs and entrepreneurs, he told The Huffington Post.His answer is unwavering: “If you want to defeat Donald Trump, and you’re that upset about him, then you should support Hillary Clinton, which is what I’m doing,” Benioff said.An increasing number of business leaders are starting to openly criticize the reality star and presumptive GOP nominee, but Benioff’s strategy takes a higher road. The 51-year-old, already widely known for his social activism, hasn't made negative comments about Trump and instead devotes resources to supporting his opponent. Benioff was supporting Clinton long before it was clear that Trump would emerge as the presumptive Republican nominee, he pointed out. He hosted a fundraiser at his home in San Francisco earlier this year that he said netted $500,000 and has donated $2,700 to her campaign.“I’m not supporting her because I’m against Trump,” he added, noting that he believes deeply in Clinton’s positions. He first came out in support of the candidate in March during an interview on CNN.“She supports equality for all, including gender equality and pay, which is important to me,” Benioff told HuffPost. “She supports LGBT equality, which is important to my employees. I think she has the right economic policies and she is the most experienced candidate for the job. She’s more likely to do the right thing than anybody else.”Benioff earned widespread recognition last year after publicly announcing there was a gender pay gap at his software company and that he would fix it. He then revealed he’d spent $3 million giving out raises to employees to ensure fair pay.He’s since become a corporate leader on gender pay equity and a number of companies have followed suit, announcing their own pay audits. In January, he urged other chief executives to stop turning “a blind eye to what’s happening in their own corporations” during a conference call organized by the White House.The chief executive also led a successful campaign to beat back several state laws that sought to legalize discrimination against LGBT people, earning wide acclaim and a profile in The Wall Street Journal, which credited him with kicking off a “new era of corporate social activism.” Though the political activism that puts him in line with the Clinton campaign took shape over the last two years, he has long partnered with the Clinton Foundation on other philanthropic endeavors. In 2014, he donated $3.5 million to Too Small To Fail, an early childhood education campaign founded in part by the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The donation fostered a literacy program at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland that helps low-income mothers teach their children to speak, read and sing.“It’s been a huge success story,” Benioff said of the joint venture with Clinton’s charitable organization. “She realizes that a child’s health and education and fundamental ability to be a success starts prenatally.”Not all his fellow CEOs are taking the speak-no-evil route when it comes to Trump. On Wednesday, venture capitalist Chris Sacca, an early Twitter investor, and billionaire Marc Cuban took part in some Trump bashing on Twitter.And earlier this week Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said Trump was on the wrong side of history when it comes to his policies on immigration.Don’t expect Benioff to follow suit. “Honestly, I’m not [worried about Trump],” he told HuffPost. “I don’t think there’s any way Donald Trump will be president.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Trappers have taken six alligators from the area.The alligator snatched the toddler on June 14 as he played at the edge of the Seven Seas Lagoon, a manmade lake at the Walt Disney Co resort.Police divers found Lane's body underwater the following afternoon, not far from where he was taken. An autopsy found that he died from drowning and traumatic injuries.At the time, the resort had ""No Swimming"" signs that did not mention alligators.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who announced Wednesday morning that he'll seek re-election, begins with an advantage over his two Democratic rivals, a new Quinnipiac survey finds.The poll finds Rubio leading Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) by 7 points, 47 percent to 40 percent, and Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) by 8 points, 48 percent to 40 percent.His decision likely comes as a relief to Republican leaders worried about keeping control of the Senate. Five other possible Republican contenders that Quinnipiac tested fared significantly worse, trailing in matchups against both Murphy and Grayson.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) predicted that a Rubio candidacy would significantly improve the GOP's chances of retaining his seat, according to The Washington Post.Rubio had previously vowed not to run, but he said in a statement that he'd changed his mind in part because ""[c]ontrol of the Senate may very well come down to the race in Florida."" His success in the hypothetical matchups also contrasts with Republicans' fortunes at the top of the ticket, where Quinnipiac found presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump trailing significantly behind his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.""It is no secret that I have significant disagreements with Donald Trump,"" Rubio said in the statement announcing his candidacy, distancing himself from the businessman. ""His positions on many key issues are still unknown. And some of his statements, especially about women and minorities, I find not just offensive but unacceptable. If he is elected, we will need Senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him. I’ve proven a willingness to do both.""Polling on the Florida Senate race has so far been relatively scarce, with much of the available data coming from partisan firms' surveys. The only other surveys released since June gave Murphy a 1-point edge over Rubio. The Democratic firm Public Policy Polling conducted both polls.Quinnipiac surveyed 975 Florida voters between June 8 and June 19, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones."
12,POLITICS,Think Tankers Don't Get Trump,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thank-tanks-donald-trump_us_576affe5e4b0c0252e784cee,Can their advice change him? Should they even try?,2016-06-22,Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke about his foreign policy positions at an event hosted by the Center for the National Interest on April 27.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576b006c2200002e00f82717.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Back in the Cold War days, a big debate among the nation’s think tanks was how to deal with communist countries: Was it better to isolate them? Or were dialogue and engagement more likely to bring about positive change?Decades later, policy wonks face the same question about presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.“This is not your normal ‘Oh, we have a more extreme candidate.’ This is a person who's unsuited and unqualified and frankly, undemocratic,” said Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution. “I haven't heard of a single person from a major think tank joining the Trump team. That's very unusual.""For many of Mann’s think tank colleagues -- and particularly for conservatives --engaging with Trump risks legitimizing him and his numerous controversial statements while simultaneously damaging their own reputations.“There's a lot of people who believe that Donald Trump is the most serious threat to American democracy we have seen in the modern era,” Mann said. “I think it will be very hard finding serious, honest experts [to] join in.”Of course, experts hoping to isolate Trump have found a willing accomplice in Trump himself.“He just doesn't seem to be interested,” said the American Enterprise Institute’s Ramesh Ponnuru. “Nothing he has done is suggestive of any interest in policy.”By this point in a presidential campaign, nominees have typically established alliances with like-minded think tanks. While the groups cannot endorse candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status, their researchers provide the detailed analyses and intellectual heft that inform and support a candidate's policy proposals.“It's fairly clear, for the most part, the kinds of Republican experts who would be all on board with a presidential campaign at this point -- with task forces, and policy proposals and meetings and so forth -- are not,” said Norm Ornstein, who is also with the AEI. “You could convene his policy team in a bathtub.”Trump’s campaign did not respond to The Huffington Post's requests for comment on this story. Over the months, the real estate mogul has downplayed his need for expert advice, citing his own “very good brain” as evidence. On dealing with the self-described Islamic State, for example, Trump said that he knew more about the terror group than the military commanders fighting it.Ponnuru said his colleagues are divided on whether it's better to stay away from Trump or get close to him, but a consensus has emerged that Trump is not likely to take their advice anyway. “The prevailing sentiment is that he’s going to do his thing, and he’s going to continue to do his thing,” Ponnuru said.Trump’s attitude does offer the benefit of not having to justify the position of a candidate that you might not agree with, he conceded. “It’s a little bit liberating, being able to say you’re completely independent from the nominee.”One notable exception has been Heritage Foundation economist Stephen Moore, who has been open about his support for Trump. Moore, a longtime proponent of supply-side theory, with its emphasis on lower taxes for investment income, is particularly pleased with Trump’s tax proposal. “It’s going to be a blockbuster. It’s going to be the best tax cut plan since Ronald Reagan,” said Moore, who hastened to point out that his views are his own, and do not represent the Heritage Foundation's position.Moore said he doesn’t share Trump’s views on trade policy or immigration, although he does understand why those messages have resonated with many Republican voters. “If Trump wins, there will be kind of a change in Republican dogma on both economic policy and foreign policy. No question about it,” he said.But even some beneficial influence is better than none, Moore argued. On trade, for example, Trump hasn't spoken about a 45 percent tariff on Chinese products ever since Moore and others advised him against it, he said. “Most people I talk to are like, 'Oh my god, I’m so glad you’re working with Trump. Maybe you can push him in a good direction.'”Yet that view is a lonely one. Helping Trump isn't easy, given his general lack of interest. And the groups that do lend their names to his cause should be prepared for scrutiny.The Center for the National Interest learned this firsthand when it hosted Trump's foreign policy speech in April. A researcher there was fired after writing a blog post that criticized the think tank's decision to host what he called a “booster rally” for Trump. And the very day of the speech, Jacob Heilbrunn, the editor of the think tank’s magazine, wrote an article for Politico Magazine explaining his decision to invite Trump. Heilbrunn said that he wasn’t signing up to support Trump, but was glad for the chance to hear his views. “I think he is having a salutary effect in forcing open a long-overdue debate in the GOP over foreign policy,” Heilbrunn wrote.Mann, of Brookings, said it would be tempting for experts -- particularly at lesser-known think tanks -- to offer support in exchange for access in a potential Trump presidency. “I don't doubt there will be some think tanks we've never heard of from which individuals emerge to advise Trump,” he said.But Mann hopes they'll avoid the temptation. ""This, in some ways, will be a test of whether individuals and organizations merit their labeling,"" he added.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

15,ENTERTAINMENT,Here's What It's Like To Have Tina Fey Play You In A Movie,Todd Van Luling,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tina-fey-whiskey-tango-foxtrot-kim-barker_us_576a78cfe4b09926ce5d1787,Try having the beloved actress and comedian spend a day in your shoes.,2016-06-22,"Tina Fey and Kim Barker appear on Andy Cohen's ""Watch What Happens Live.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576a7cf02200002d00f82553.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 2011, The New York Times published a review of journalist Kim Barker's memoir, The Taliban Shuffle. Amid a positive review, Times writer Michiko Kakutani claimed Barker ""depicts herself as a sort of Tina Fey character."" This was enough to get the attention of the actual Fey, who then convinced producer Lorne Michaels and Paramount to option the book for a movie.It has been more than three months since that movie adaptation, titled ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,"" debuted. Barker, who now works for the Times herself, has had a moment to process how she feels about the ""30 Rock"" actress and recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor portray her in the Afghanistan-war-focused movie.""I do think we have similar senses of humor,"" Barker told The Huffington Post. ""You know, she's funnier obviously, because she's Tina Fey, but we have similar senses of humor.""Barker is happy with the portrayal -- adding that ""Tina's been nothing but gracious to me"" -- but has been frustrated by a few of the reviews for the movie (""Foxtrot"" has a fresh 68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes).""I was not surprised by the sexism I read in some of the reviews,"" said Barker, explaining how she felt that these critics misinterpreted ""Foxtrot"" solely because it had a female lead. ""People saying, 'Oh, it's Eat, Pray, Love with guns.' That was frustrating to me because I deliberately wrote an anti-Eat, Pray, Love.""With the movie now coming out on home release, Barker hopes that it will find those fans who will understand her attempt to bring difficult conversations about war into a more popular narrative.""There's still a war going on [in Afghanistan] even though we don't really hear about it in any sort of presidential debate or public policy talk,"" said Barker. ""People are tired of hearing about it and I get it, it's war. I just wanted to come up with some way that could show what I had seen and also what I felt like would be interesting for readers ... and I didn't think that would be a serious foreign policy book, unfortunately.""""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is now on a very short list of journalism-focused movies with studio-sized budgets. Journalism teachers will inevitably show the movie right along with staples such as ""All the President's Men,"" ""Shattered Glass,"" ""Network,"" and the recent winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, ""Spotlight.""""I'm just like a normal journalist, right. Just doing my stories,"" said Barker, who felt strange about this movie joining the journalism-studies canon. ""If it gets anybody interested in journalism, I think it's great.""Still, Barker wants viewers to know she's not the person Fey portrays. ""I just keep trying to divorce myself from this character of Kim Baker,"" said Barker. In the film, Fey's character is actually named ""Kim Baker"" rather than ""Barker"" in a small attempt to stress this distinction.""It's weird enough having people -- who have seen the movie and not read the book -- write me emails saying thank you so much for your service,"" explained Barker. ""And I'm like, 'Ah man, you should read the book before you thank me for it, because I'm not nearly as brave as Tina Fey's character is in the movie. I ran away from explosions, I didn't run toward them.""Barker was a bit scared to agree to the movie, but that's also what appealed to her. ""I mean, it was exciting and it was terrifying,"" said Barker. ""But again, [recently], I threw out the first pitch at a White Sox game, which was also terrifying. I feel like life is real short. You only go around once. And when it presents you with those sorts of opportunities and things that seem like risks, it's important to try it out. You might fail, so what? People might not like you, oh well. But I've always tried to live that way at least."" ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is currently available on Digital HD and will debut on Blu-ray June 28. Doubleday published Barker's book, The Taliban Shuffle, in 2011. "

Their research focuses on something called the Fermi paradox, named after physicist Enrico Fermi. In the 1950s, Fermi raised the question that if, as many scientists believe, there are huge numbers of technological civilizations out there, why haven't earthlings seen tangible evidence?In their paper, the Cornell researchers wrote:""We clearly show that human communication has reached a sphere with a radius of roughly 80 light years, and has not reached a number of stars and planets adequate to expect an answer.Solomonides and Terzian also consider something known as the mediocrity principle, which suggests that earthlings -- compared with life that may exist in the Milky Way galaxy in which we live -- aren't that special.""Whatever natural processes gave rise to life on our planet should be extraordinarily common, and should have happened in enumerable places throughout the galaxy,"" the scientists wrote. ""Yet, we are, to the best of our knowledge thus far, utterly alone. How can this be?""Solomonides said the search for extraterrestrial intelligence by the California-based SETI Institute, which is trying to locate a definitive ET signal from outer space, is the best chance to find alien neighbors.""I think what SETI has been doing is exactly what we should be doing, because if we stop looking and listening for a second, we could miss it when it finally comes,"" Solomonides said. ""If we stopped paying attention for a year, a month or a week -- if that is when we finally get a signal, the one powerful signal from a civilization that indicates that they're there -- we've missed it and there's no way to ever get that back, so we have to keep looking and trying.""Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, said searchers look for definitive ET signs.""Our experiments listen for alien signals that are relentless -- you can find them repeatedly,"" Shostak told HuffPost in an email. ""Otherwise, who knows what you've picked up?"" ""Perhaps the extraterrestrials aren't going to spend the money to broadcast our way until they've heard from us, and know of our existence,"" he said. ""If so, it could be a long time before such a targeted signal is transmitted to Earth.""But you know what? We could pick up the signal from a powerful alien radar transmitter tomorrow -- just the radio noise from an advanced society,"" Shostak said.""Given that possibility, I'm not inclined to sit on my hands for a few centuries to await a deliberate response to 'I Love Lucy.'""Shostak, for one, isn't waiting 1,500 years for that conclusive alien signature to arrive.

17,POLITICS,Donald Trump's New Evangelical Advisers Neither Love Him Nor Hate Him. They Just Want Him To Listen.,Sam Stein and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-evangelical-board_us_5769f902e4b0c0252e77b204,Some members of the group have criticized Trump in the past.,2016-06-22,"Flanked by Sealy Yates (L), founder of My Faith Votes, and Kelly Shackelford (R), president of the First Liberty Institute, Tony Perkins (C), president of the Family Research Council, speaks during a press conference following a meeting with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, June 21, 2016 in New York.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5769fdf31500002b0073bd7b.jpeg?cache=2qO5GnVpdV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hoping to solidify his standing with a slightly ill-fitting constituency, Donald Trump announced on Tuesday the creation of an executive council of evangelical leaders to advise his presidential campaign. Made up of mostly conservative political and religious figures, the council, on the surface, seemed like an attempt to help sand down the rough edges of a candidate known more for for appearances in the tabloids than in the pew. But Tuesday's announcement also exposed deep philosophical rifts with the evangelical community that Trump must contend with as he transitions to the general election campaign.Members of the council made clear, repeatedly, that they were not endorsing Trump's campaign, and were merely advising the candidate. Many of them remain at odds with Trump on some of his defining issues and on his rhetoric. One member of the group, in fact, had written in November that it was embarrassing to watch fellow clergy members support Trump -- a Facebook post that was quickly unearthed after the advisory board announcement. The author of that passage, the Rev. Tony Suarez, told HuffPost he probably did it out of desperation (it's now deleted). Suarez, an executive vice president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, supported Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for president. Like others who gathered in New York on Wednesday, Suarez said he remained uncommitted to Trump, even after meeting with the candidate. But he said he saw the creation of the board as a positive step, if only for providing him and others a chance to urge Trump to think and talk differently about certain issues.""I was very frustrated with Mr. Trump in the fall,"" Suarez said. ""But in the spirit of reconciliation and believing that everyone deserves a second chance, I'm giving Mr. Trump that opportunity. Okay, you're talking about building bridges, you say you love Latinos, you want us to love you -- then okay, let's come to the table.""Trump presents one of more uncomfortable tables for the Christian conservative movement to come to in recent politics. It's not only his personal story that poses problems, filled as it is with unscrupulous business practices, two tumultuous divorces, and prior liberal leanings on topics like abortion. It's his current policy portfolio, too. The two immovable pillars of Trump's presidential campaign are opposition to undocumented immigrants and a fierce rejection of refugees from the Middle East. Those happen to be two of the occasional break points between the religious right and the Republican Party. These fissures were evident in the composition of Trump's evangelic advisory board. While attendees shared some of Trump's more hard-edged views -- Robert Jeffress, senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Dallas, for example, has made the case it is the Christian position to deny refugees and immigrants entry to the U.S. -- many others had more nuanced takes. A.R. Bernard, senior pastor and CEO of the Christian Cultural Center, has said that ""the Republican Party must develop and pass comprehensive immigration reform."" Ronnie Floyd, senior pastor at Cross Church, has talked about need to be humane to children fleeing Central America. He recently finished his term as president of the Southern Baptist Convention, which last week approved a resolution encouraging churches to help refugees. In April, Floyd urged the same. ""We need to love them, meet their needs compassionately, but also be more than faithful to present to them the Good News of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,"" Floyd said. Robert Morris, senior pastor at Gateway Church, has spoken about the need for open-mindedness with regard to refugees in the Middle East, a position an aide said ""has not changed."" Richard Land, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary, has advocated for comprehensive immigration reform and was even at the announcement of the Senate's 2013 gang of eight bill. Johnnie Moore, president of corporate consultant The Kairos Co., has discussed publicly the need for the U.S. to accept refugees from ISIS-affected regions -- including Syria -- but he encouraged caution in the aftermath of the attacks in Paris.  None of the council members on Tuesday pretended as if these differences didn't exist. Rather, they made the case that dialogue afforded them an opportunity to add more spiritual depth to Trump's point of view.  ""I think in the primary season there is a less nuanced way of talking about all kinds of things and as you get to the general election, the nuance of policy develops and you look to the prospect of governance,"" Moore said. ""I do think all of these issues get an additional layer of complexity and understanding."" Hopes for a softer, gentler Trump have become routine for Republicans in the past few months. And it may indeed take a room full of religious leaders for these types of political prayers to be answered. Several attendees left the meeting saying Trump had listened attentively. Suarez was optimistic that the candidate would change, and said he plans to press Trump to talk more about hard-working Latinos who love America and to respect the humanity of young undocumented immigrants. Moore said there was ""amicability"" in the room. Bernard, who is black, said that he told Trump there was an opportunity for him to connect with young black voters who don't feel the ""love affair with the Clintons"" their elders have, and that Trump seemed surprised but serious about wanting advice. The only thing left is to see if Trump actually follows through, Bernard said.""If this executive advisory committee has some influence, then we should see his tone change over the next several weeks, couple of months,"" Bernard said. ""We should see that. We should see an effect of the existence of this advisory executive committee."" In the end, Trump may not have to change all that much to win over the skeptics. The question facing those evangelical leaders who gathered in New York on Tuesday is as much political as religious. And it is similar to the one facing their congregations: Is it better to end up with a Republican who says things they dislike, or a Democrat whose views on social issues stand in opposition to theirs?Floyd, for one, seemed to be answering yes to the Republican question when offering his reasons for getting involved with Trump. ""With the following evangelical concern of Supreme Court appointments, the sanctity and dignity of human life from the womb to the tomb, religious liberty at home and abroad, Israel and the Middle East, poverty, crime, violence, lack of opportunity in urban areas, and racial tension being at stake, I believe it is incumbent on me to serve in this advisory capacity,"" Floyd said in a statement.Andy Campbell contributed reporting.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Following a public outcry after the purge was uncovered in April ahead of the Democratic primary, officials categorized it as routine maintenance inexplicably gone awry.Now, according to data published Tuesday by WNYC, it seems the ""routine maintenance"" disproportionately affected Hispanics, with voters in predominantly Hispanic districts purged from the election rolls 60 percent more often than anyone else.Per the WNYC investigation, 13.9 percent of voters in predominantly Hispanic districts saw their names removed from the rolls, while in all other districts, the purge affected just 8.7 percent of voters.The purge and WNYC's findings have raised some concerns about voter suppression, spurring action from elected Democrats. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced in April that he was opening an investigation into the city Board of Elections over the matter, as did city Comptroller Scott Stringer, who said he planned to audit the board.Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.), who represents the 7th District -- which had the highest percentage of purged voters -- told WNYC she intends to verify the findings and alert the Department of Justice.""I do not want to think that it was deliberate, you know, because that would be voter suppression, and at a time when the Voting Rights Act is under attack in Washington, to have this type of action in a city and state like New York, a Democratic city, it’s just beyond any comprehension,” she said.In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday, Velázquez asked for federal election monitors to oversee next week's congressional primary there on June 28. ""The sheer volume of purged voters in the 7th congressional district is staggering and incomprehensible,"" she wrote.Board of Elections Executive Director Michael Ryan told WNYC the purged voters will be reinstated ahead of the primary. Two officials who served on the board and were behind the decision have been suspended without pay."

Most of all, he wishes that he could have shared those experiences with the children he still hopes to have someday with his fiancée, Hannah Davis.Jeter revealed as much in a conversation with President Barack Obama, which was published Wednesday on Jeter's media outlet, The Players' Tribune. In fact, Jeter actually kept a diary during his last season in 2014. He said he would jot down what he was thinking and feeling after each game on his retirement tour to create a ""Dad scrapbook,"" as he called it. Before Jeter could explain further, Obama jumped in: ""[You started the book to show] that Dad actually had some game."" Despite a Hall-of-Fame career, Jeter has a hard time grappling with the idea that his kids will grow up only understanding their dad's career through history and highlights, never realizing or feeling the impact Jeter had in the moment. ""I wish I would've done that [kept a diary] throughout my career. There are so many experiences that you tend to forget,"" Jeter continued. ""So if I could go back to 25, I would say, [write in a diary] every day.""

""Let's give the next campus sexual assault victim no reason to fear that her attacker will end up walking around free after spending less time in jail than it takes to finish a single college semester.""The bill, co-sponsored by California Assembly members Evan Low (D-San Jose) and Bill Dodd (D-Napa), seeks to close a gap between the sentencing for sexual assaults using force and those committed against people who cannot resist at the time.If someone is convicted of assault and used force, California law requires a mandatory prison sentence in the case. But if the victim was unconscious or severely intoxicated, and thus the assailant didn't need to use force because the victim could not resist, judges can sentence offenders to little or no jail time. That's what happened in Turner's case, because the judge cited ""unusual circumstances"" on June 2 when he handed down a six-month jail sentence and three years probation to the convicted sex offender. Turner faced as many as 14 years in prison, and Rosen's office requested six years in state prison.""Current law actually incentivizes rapists to get their victims intoxicated before assaulting them,"" Low said. ""While we can’t go back and change what happened, we can make sure it never happens again."" Turner's victim was severely intoxicated and unconscious at the time of his assault on her, but the judge said because the former Stanford University student was young and had no previous criminal record, he would give him a less severe punishment. The proposal, which denies probation for these types of sex offenders, would have an impact on most campus rape cases, according to a background information from Low and Dodd's office, because a majority of assaults of women in college involve intoxicated victims and offenders. The proposal quickly faced skepticism from Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of the activist group UltraViolet, which has been active in a campaign to oust Aaron Persky, the judge in Turner's case. Chaudhary worried the proposal would disproportionately harm minorities and do nothing to hold Persky accountable. ""While it is long past time that our justice system take the crime of rape seriously, we need judges who focus on finding justice for rape survivors,"" Chaudhary said in a statement, ""not the re-hashing of bad policies that rig the system against poor people and people of color.""_______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and sexual violence and is based in New York.

The Huffington Post first reported about the agreements with low-level employees requiring them to give up the right to work at a competitor for a two-year period after leaving Jimmy John's.The company defined a ""competing"" sandwich seller as any business that derives 10 percent or more of its revenue from the sale of sandwiches and that resides within 3 miles of a Jimmy John’s location. The firm has roughly 2,000 restaurants. If enforced, the clause would effectively bar a former Jimmy John's employee from working at restaurants or delis in entire cities around the U.S.""Noncompete agreements for low-wage workers are unconscionable,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who brokered the settlement, said in a statement. ""They limit mobility and opportunity for vulnerable workers and bully them into staying with the threat of being sued. Companies should stop using these agreements for minimum wage employees.""Executing the noncompete agreement was left at the discretion of individual franchisees, but the clauses were included in hiring packets that Jimmy John's corporate distributed. The packets will no longer include the noncompete language, and franchisees will be voiding any existing agreements with low-level workers, according to Schneiderman.Jimmy John's said in a statement that it was happy to reach a settlement. The company said it would not support the enforcement of a noncompete on store employees. ""We value the [attorney general's] professionalism throughout this matter, and appreciate the opportunity to have worked together,"" the company said.Jimmy John's faced scrutiny from Congress and state regulators and the company was mocked following revelations of the agreements in 2014. Noncompetes have traditionally been reserved for high-ranking executives or employees who hold onto trade secrets, to prevent them from taking insider corporate knowledge to a competitor. Sandwich makers and delivery drivers earning close to minimum wage pose no such threat. But by forbidding them to work at other sandwich shops, Jimmy John's could effectively suppress their wages, preventing them from taking their work to the highest bidder. And though it's unlikely such a noncompete would hold up in court, many workers may not have the wherewithal to challenge it legally. That's why the proliferation of noncompete agreements concerns many legal experts and worker advocates. As HuffPost previously reported, even low-wage dog sitters have been required to agree to such clauses.Jimmy John's agreement is solely with New York State. The company has not said whether it will remove noncompete agreements from hiring packets for new store employees elsewhere in the US.New York State allows noncompete agreements only under particular circumstances. These were not met in Jimmy John's case. according to Schneiderman. The New York attorney general reached a similar agreement last week with the news service Law360, which agreed to drop its noncompetes. "

In the wake of the tragedy, the billionaire businessman and owner of the Dallas Mavericks will donate $1 million to the Dallas police department in an effort to better protect the city's LGBT community, CNN reports. The donation will be used to fund additional patrols in Dallas's Oak Lawn neighborhood, which boasts a sizable LGBT community, as well as an estimated an estimated 16,000 hours of overtime for officers to enhance counter-terrorism efforts across the city. In a press release, the 57-year-old entrepreneur stated that he was ""proud to be able to help the city of Dallas."" Meanwhile, Dallas Police Chief David Brown praised the effort, vowing to ""earmark and track the expenditure of these funds to ensure its effective use in creating a safe environment"" for the city's LGBT residents. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings echoed those sentiments, praising Cuban as ""a man of action."" ""Once again, Mark has demonstrated his devotion to his city by stepping up in a time of need,"" he said in a press release. Cuban has been an outspoken advocate of the LGBT community for quite some time. In 2014, he praised NBA player Jason Collins, who became the first openly gay male player to play in a major U.S. professional sport, noting, ""I think it's no big deal and that’s exactly the way it should be."" Unfortunately, the move comes amidst concerns about the treatment of LGBT individuals by law enforcement. A 2015 report published by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, cited a 2013 survey which found that 48 percent of LGBT victims of violence reported experiencing police misconduct.The UCLA report also cited a second survey which found that 40 percent of gay and bisexual male survivors of domestic violence believed police intervention would be unhelpful or very unhelpful.

Hillary Clinton Chart,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/huffpost-pollster-trump-vs-clinton-chart_us_576aec2be4b09926ce5d8763,"Yes, we are going to add Libertarian Gary Johnson soon.",2016-06-22,"See, isn't it great to be able to filter by partisanship? Democratic voters only.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576aece92200002d00f826be.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We’ve made a lot of tweaks and adjustments to the HuffPost Pollster charts in the last few months. The updates have been great progress for the site -- for example, the charts are responsive on mobile now! -- but there have been a few bugs along the way, as there are with any updating process. For a little while today our general election chart for Republican Donald Trump vs. Democrat Hillary Clinton showed a closer-than-expected margin of about 4 points separating the candidates. We published this explanation in Wednesday’s newsletter. (If you don’t get the newsletter in your inbox, go here and sign up!) If most polls are showing Clinton up by 5 to 7 points, why is the Pollster chart only showing her up by 4? The simple answer is that the chart estimates the candidates’ trends separately — considering only the numbers for Clinton in estimating the Clinton trend line, and only the Trump numbers for the Trump trend line. The margins between the candidates are calculated from the model-produced trends. That means that the average margin between the candidates in the polls might not match the trend line margin that the model produces. Right now, that’s happening because the poll numbers are varying quite a bit for each candidate. For example, Trump’s vote support in polls that were released in the last week ranges from a low of 32 percent to a high of 45 percent. Clinton’s support ranges from 41 percent to 50 percent. So the current model estimates of Trump at 40 percent and Clinton at 44 percent make sense, even if the margin is smaller than what many of the individual polls are showing.This is actually not different from what any model does -- you don’t calculate polling averages by averaging the margins between the candidates, but by averaging each candidate’s values. However, since our Kalman filter model is estimating a trend line, rather than a simple average, there’s room for the margins to look different from what a raw polling average would show. This is a key difference between how Pollster aggregates polls and how most others do.The other part of the picture, which we diagnosed late this morning and have since corrected, was that a feature we added to the charts had temporarily confused the model. We added the ability to filter by respondents’ partisanship, which inadvertently caused our averages to be slightly off for a few days. The model was pulling in all of the subpopulation data, in addition to the full poll data. Today’s fix resolved that. The partisanship filters were worth it, though. You can now create charts like the one below, which shows the polling averages for Democrats, using the “subpopulations” filter in the customization window.What isn’t fixed is the variance in poll numbers that we mentioned above. In part, the Clinton and Trump numbers are varying because pollsters are asking the general election tossup question in different ways. If the question includes Libertarian Gary Johnson plus an other category or other candidates, Clinton’s and Trump’s numbers decrease slightly as these categories pull a bit of support from each. If the question doesn’t mention Johnson and simply has an “other” category, the Clinton and Trump numbers tend to be a bit higher.We’re working on a fix for that, too, but it isn’t ready yet. In the coming weeks we will separate the questions that include Johnson into a separate chart. That means we’ll have two general election charts: Trump vs. Clinton with an “other” category, and Trump vs. Clinton vs. Johnson. Our default general election chart will still be the Trump vs. Clinton chart, but in response to high demand and the aforementioned methodological issues, we’re adding one that will explicitly include Johnson.Some users have also noticed differences between the default chart and customized charts that seem to be larger than expected. That’s not a bug -- the Kalman filter model takes a long time to run, which means that it’s not feasible to use for our customization features. Because of that, once you click on “Customize this chart” and begin changing the chart, it reverts to a simpler loess regression line that can be quickly calculated and displayed. This means sometimes there will be differences between the model and the customized chart estimates. It’s also why when you switch to “less smoothing” -- which uses the loess regression -- the trend might actually look smoother than the default model.We sincerely appreciate all of our users and the valuable feedback we get. We’re working hard to adjust to this unusual and unpredictable election season as we upgrade and continue to improve the site. We’ll publish small updates in our daily newsletter and longer articles when it’s warranted. And, of course, we don’t plan to make major changes once the fall campaigns are underway."

29,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Isn't Tacking Right For The General Election,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-tpp_us_576af709e4b09926ce5d9e6c,That could spell doom for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,2016-06-22,Hillary Clinton doesn't seem to be backing down on her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576af7fe15000030001bad94.jpeg?cache=NMMtcslGxh&ops=crop_11_192_4189_3174%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Presidential candidates almost always follow the same pattern of ideological movement during election years. They play to their party's base in the primaries, and then temper their message to win over moderates in the general. Hillary Clinton isn't following this playbook on economic policy. She didn't move much to the left during her battle with Bernie Sanders, and now that she is the presumptive nominee, she isn't cutting right. In recent speeches in Ohio and North Carolina, Clinton's economic pitch has been indistinguishable from the positions she laid out during the primary debates. She still supports expanding Social Security and guaranteeing debt-free college tuition. She stands by her defense of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, and mentions Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) by name when lauding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that the progressive icon established. Equal pay for equal work hasn't gone anywhere, and neither has her call for federal childcare support.The policy that matters most in Clinton's stump speech is her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. When Clinton formally came out in opposition to the TPP in October, it was widely viewed as a reversal -- she had worked on early drafts of the pact as Secretary of State, and promoted it as an important foreign policy. As recently as January, U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Thomas Donohue -- the top corporate lobbyist in America, and a partisan Republican -- predicted that Clinton would come back around on TPP if elected.TPP sharply divided the Democratic party in 2015. While President Barack Obama and Republican leaders in Congress strongly back the trade pact with 11 other Pacific nations, most Democrats oppose it, as do many Tea Party Republicans. The discontent between Obama and congressional Democrats eventually festered into an ugly public battle with Warren. TPP critics note the deal empowers corporations to challenge domestic rules and regulations before an international court, and object to provisions designed to raise the prices of life-saving medicines. Obama and the Chamber maintain that it will boost economic growth and help workers both at home and abroad.But so far, Clinton isn't budging on her TPP opposition.""We should renegotiate deals that aren’t working for Americans, and reject any agreements – like the Trans-Pacific Partnership – that don’t meet my high bar for raising wages or creating good-paying jobs,"" Clinton said Tuesday in Ohio.Barney Frank, a top Clinton surrogate on economic matters, published an op-ed in The Boston Globe on Monday titled ""RIP, TPP"" in which he blasted calls for Congress to pursue a vote on TPP during the lame-duck session following the November elections. Although the White House has been eager for such a move, the rumor on Capitol Hill is that support for the pact has fallen through the floor since last year. In late June 2015, Congress granted Obama so-called ""fast track"" trade powers -- blocking legislators from amending trade pacts negotiated by the president, and barring filibusters on those deals in the Senate. At the time, there were 218 votes in the House in support of the deal -- the exact number needed for passage. On controversial votes, a 218 majority typically means that the Speaker of the House has at least a few extra votes on standby that he isn't forcing out. But it also means that the margin is pretty slim. The loss of a handful of Democrats (or Republicans) would be enough to block TPP's enactment.TPP figures prominently in the economic policy of the next administration because it is one of the only areas of policymaking where Clinton can achieve progressive goals without actually doing anything. Absent a landslide victory, Clinton will face at least one chamber of Congress controlled by Republicans if she takes office. If the past eight years have been any guide, getting the GOP to play ball with a Democratic president will be extremely difficult. But she won't need a cooperative Republican majority to take down TPP. All she'll need to do is refuse to sign a TPP bill.A year ago, things looked grim for TPP opponents. Hillary Clinton may have rescued them."

Paul LePage (R) is tired of people buying candy with food stamps. He also loves presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_303_4782_2389%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) is putting vulnerable people in his state at risk with his food stamp crusade, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Wednesday. In a recent letter to the Obama administration, LePage said that if the federal government won't let him stop Mainers from using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program debit cards to buy candy and soda, then the state will wash its hands of the SNAP program altogether and let the federal government deal with it. USDA spokesman Matt Herrick says the agency can't just step in and do the state's job of distributing the federal benefit to low-income individuals and families. ""We don't have the authority or the funding to administer SNAP at the state level,"" Herrick told The Huffington Post. In other words, if the state government won't provide nutrition assistance in Maine, no one will. Such a situation would be unprecedented. ""So what this means in real terms, for real-world people, is that children suffer, they don't have adequate nutrition,"" Herrick said. ""There are about 100,000 families in Maine who depend on the program, and they're no different than anyone else, and they shouldn't be penalized or threatened with greater hardship.""LePage spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett said said it's ""laughable"" that the Obama administration doesn't have the resources to run its own program. Roughly 44 million Americans get SNAP benefits averaging $125 per month. Distributed on debit cards, the benefits can be used to purchase any food product that isn't alcohol or a prepared meal. Food stamp recipients' occasional tendency to use their benefits to buy certain things that people generally enjoy -- such as steak, soda or candy -- has riled Republicans ever since Ronald Reagan complained about a ""strapping young buck"" buying a steak in the 1970s, back when benefits came on actual stamps. In his letter to the USDA, LePage continued this rich tradition, saying the Obama administration ""looks the other way as billions of taxpayer dollars finance a steady diet of Mars bars and Mountain Dew.""Last year, citing widespread public obesity, Maine requested a waiver from federal rules that prevent states from tinkering with the program parameters so the state could restrict candy and soda. This month, the USDA told the state it lacked an adequate control group to measure the outcome of the proposed soda ban for SNAP recipients.""Since the restriction would be implemented statewide, the study design does not have a counterfactual to show what would have happened in the absence of the restriction,"" the USDA's letter said. Herrick stressed that the agency hasn't denied Maine's request outright, but has simply requested more information. LePage clearly doesn't see it that way. ""The Obama Administration’s decision to deny Maine is unreasonable,"" Bennett said. "

With his latest piece, ""The Floating Piers,"" 81-year-old artist Christo proves magic isn't just a thing of fairy tales. It exists in real life. But it doesn't come with the blink of an eye. It comes after years of careful planning and hard work. And millions of dollars.The story of ""The Floating Piers"" began 46 years ago, when Christo and his late wife and fellow artist Jeanne-Claude were approached by an Argentine art historian to build a floating bridge atop South America's Río de la Plata, realizing the artists' dream of walking on water. Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 from complications resulting from a brain aneurysm, but Christo was determined to make their shared vision a reality.For years, Christo and Jeanne-Claude devoted their lives to bringing free, accessible artworks to the public -- artworks whose sole purpose is to enchant the viewer, without a deeper meaning or implication. Today, Christo's works continue to take the shape of massive, ephemeral installations that transform the natural landscape for a brief while.Over the course of his career, he's wrapped an Australian coast in synthetic fabric, stretched a curtain across a Rocky Mountain valley, and encased a Parisian bridge in sand-colored cloth. For the duo's most recent work together, ""The Gates,"" completed in 2005, Christo and Jeanne Claude installed 7,500 saffron-paneled gates in New York's Central Park, a project over 30 years in the making. ""I know these projects are totally irrational, totally useless,"" Christo told The New York Times. ""The world can live without them, nobody needs them, only me and Jeanne-Claude. She always made the point that they exist because we like to have them, and if others like them, it’s only a bonus.""Although the seed of ""The Floating Piers"" was planted over 40 years ago, the project was realized in only 22 months, a record for the artists whose works are known to take decades to make. Throughout the spring and summer of 2014, Christo hunted for the body of water he wished to traverse, selecting Italy's Lake Iseo as the most rousing site. For two weeks only, the lake will be dressed up with a 1.8-mile walkway, measuring 53 feet across. The triangular dock's foundation is made from 200,000 floating, high-density polyethylene cubes, covered in 100,000 square meters of dahlia-colored fabric, waterproof and stain resistant, shimmering and rippling. The bridge stretches from the Italian mainland to two small islands, Monte Isola and San Paolo, allowing visitors to walk to both as well as between the two. The piece cost approximately $16.8 million dollars and was funded entirely through the sale of Christo's original drawings and collages. ""It’s actually very painterly, like an abstract painting,"" Christo told The New York Times, ""but it will change all the time."" The massive walkway, like a constantly undulating golden quilt, is designed to shift according to weather and time of day. Like a massive mood ring, the work reflects its environment, becoming warmer or paler, speckled or glassy, depending on each viewer's particular experience. The texture, too, is constantly in flux -- sometimes wet and squishy, other times soft and warm. Walking barefoot is encouraged. The piece opened to the public on Saturday, Jun. 18, and will exist until Jul. 3. On each of those 16 brief-yet-wondrous days, approximately 40,000 visitors will experience the supernatural sensation of walking on water, moving in harmony with the soft rhythm of the lake below. Yet again, Christo and Jeanne-Claude have proved that, at its best, art is interchangeable with magic, and most anything we imagine can become a reality. But it's not just a matter of a magic word or a poof of smoke -- such an achievement takes years of planning and millions of dollars, not to mention the help of engineers, construction companies, deep-sea divers and boat hands. Lifeguards will be on hand in case any overexcited viewers amble right off the floating walkway. There are no handrails, because where's the magic in that? CORRECTION: Due to an error in Getty Images, the date on which visitors toured ""The Floating Piers"" was incorrectly stated as June 8. The photo captions have since been corrected."
32,BUSINESS,Why Elon Musk Is Betting On Solar Power Instead Of Wind,Alexander C. Kaufman and Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tesla-wind-power_us_576a9cdae4b0c0252e77cda2,“I think we can solve the problem with the giant fusion reactor in the sky called the sun.”,2016-06-22,Solar has generally seen more new investment than wind in America recently. Numbers seen here represent billions of dollars.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576aa1702200002d00f825c7.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Elon Musk doesn’t see a place for a wind power division in his expanding clean-energy empire. The Tesla chief announced plans on Tuesday to transform his electric automaker into the world’s first sustainable energy behemoth by merging the Model S maker with one of his other companies, SolarCity.“I don’t think we’re going to get into [wind],” Musk told The Huffington Post on a conference call after announcing the bid, worth up to $3 billion. “I think we can solve the problem [of renewable energy] with the giant fusion reactor in the sky called the sun.” That isn’t to say wind power won’t play some part in Tesla's effort to refashion itself as an energy company. The plan involves ramping up production of the lithium-ion batteries Tesla uses to power its vehicles. Last year, the company released the Powerwall, a standalone battery system based on that same technology. The Powerwall enables everyone from individual homeowners to utility companies to store excess energy produced when the sun is out or wind is blowing. Tesla, which partnered with SolarCity for to launch the Powerwall, has marketed the product as an ideal add-on to a home solar system, but the devices work just as well with any other electricity source, including wind turbines. Wind and solar power have both gotten cheaper in recent years, and the trend will continue over the next several decades, according to a recent report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). Solar and wind will be the ""cheapest ways to produce electricity"" for most of the world by the time we reach the 2030s, the report says.Meanwhile, BNEF says new investment in clean energy has climbed in America over the last decade, with solar energy edging out wind in the past couple of years.Major corporations like Apple and Google have invested heavily in solar energy. While solar and wind are both cost-effective ways to generate power, wind has a number of unique challenges: Turbines are noisy and can disrupt or even harm wildlife, and they generally need to be built at remote locations far from the urban centers where energy is needed.Not that location isn't a concern for green energy generally. Unlike drums of oil, trainloads of coal or tankers of gas, it’s difficult to move solar or wind energy from place to place. Tesla is betting big that its lithium-ion packs can do the trick, and has invested billions to build the world’s biggest battery factory in Nevada. The so-called Gigafactory is slated to begin production next year.“Wind, I think, will be part of the equation,” Musk said. “But I think the wind companies are doing fine, and where wind is applicable they seem to be doing a good job of generating that.”Once the Gigafactory goes live, Musk said he hopes to leverage the company’s manufacturing muscle to increase and streamline production for existing products by Tesla and, if the merger is approved by shareholders, SolarCity.“There are benefits to sharing knowledge, assuming we’re going to be a combined company, on the manufacturing front and scaling up production and figuring out how to build the machine that builds the machine,” Musk said. “Tesla is hellbent on becoming the best manufacturer in the world.” "

Polls show that proponents of leaving and remaining in the EU have been locked in a neck-and-neck race for months.These divides don’t fall neatly along party lines, however. The greatest divisions are socioeconomic, regional -- and above all, generational.The latest YouGov poll found that 64 percent of respondents ages 18-24 want to stay in the EU, while 24 percent support a ""Brexit,"" or a British exit from the 28-country bloc. Meanwhile, the figures for respondents ages 65 and over are almost the opposite -- 58 percent of them support a Brexit, while 33 percent want to stay in the EU.As one British journalist summarized: “The fewer wrinkles you have, the much more likely it is that you want to remain in the EU; the thinner your hair, the much more likely you are to yearn for Brexit.”Since older people tend to vote at much higher rates than younger people, this poses a problem for the ""in"" camp.

The site includes a cheat sheet of discussion topics on the referendum.“Everyone's Nan is important, but your Nan can also prevent the UK leaving the EU,” the site reads. “It's time for an intergenerational chit chat.”Brennan said his strategy was to “use the passionate, under 35-year-old audience -- who are posting about the EU referendum in their social feeds but to people who already think in the same way -- and get them to try to sway the older segment, who still read traditional media and aren't exposed to a variety of sources and arguments beyond immigration and identity.”His website echoes official appeals -- Britain’s education secretary earlier this year urged young people “to go out and make the case to others, and in particular, your older friends and relatives.”At least some grandmas didn’t take kindly to this approach. “I am a Nan, with my own mind, and I have already voted. I have kept very quiet during this campaign, but I find it offensive and ageist that you think older people need to be told to vote,” Libby Williams, a grandmother living in London, wrote on Facebook in response to CallYourNan.com. “I try always to persuade younger women to use their vote as women died to get them the vote. Stereotypes are good for nothing. P.S. I go to Zumba as well!” Analysts and commentators have suggested many possible reasons for the generational divide: Younger voters are more educated, more cosmopolitan and more risk-averse when it comes to their futures; national sovereignty and independence matter more to older voters, who are more concerned about immigration and have been consuming news from Britain’s Euroskeptic press much longer.The data does show that generational priorities diverge. According to the recent YouGov poll, the top factor influencing the referendum vote of respondents under 50 is the economy and jobs, while for the most important issue for those 50 and over is Britain’s right to act independently.Young voters may feel their elders are out of touch, but members of the older generation have a powerful retort -- this is not their first Brexit referendum, and perhaps younger voters have something to learn from their experience.In 1975, the U.K. voted in its first-ever national referendum on whether to remain a part of the EU's precursor, the European Economic Community (EEC), which Britain had joined two years earlier. In the end, 67 percent voted to stay.Separated by four decades, there are striking parallels between the two referendums. In both cases, a new leader from a traditionally Euroskeptic political party came to power, pledged to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s relationship with Europe, and then gave people a vote on membership. Both times, the prime minister campaigned to remain in Europe with the support of the political opposition, while a vociferous branch of their own party demanded to leave. But there's one notable reversal -- in 1975, the ruling Euroskeptic party was the center-left Labour Party, and today, it's the center-right Conservative Party. A major reason for the political shift is that in 1975, the EEC was made up of nine countries, and the debate over membership focused primarily on economic issues -- Labour Party members were concerned about protecting British workers, and Conservatives were firm advocates of free trade.Today, the EU has 28 members and a vast array of functions, from protecting human rights to facilitating the free movement of citizens between nations. Conservatives are concerned about bureaucracy and national sovereignty, while trade unions say that EU policies actually help protect workers' rights and jobs.There are other major differences. In 1975, migration was a fringe issue in the referendum. The EEC didn’t yet allow citizens to move freely between states, and economically struggling Britain was, in any case, more concerned about people leaving the country than entering. This year, migration has been front and center in the debate, spurring xenophobia and scaremongering from British nationalist groups.Members of the generation that voted in the 1975 referendum and watched Europe develop into what it is today have strong feelings about Europe, and they are far from uniform.Gransnet, a British social networking site for older people, surveyed around 1,000 of its users earlier this year. Of those who voted to stay in the EEC in 1975, 36 percent said they would now vote to stay in the EU, while 38 percent said they would vote to leave. The WorldPost asked users of a Gransnet online forum if and how their views had changed since 1975. Here are some of their responses, which have been lightly edited and condensed:“I was born in 1943 and will be 73 in August. I voted 'in' last time we had a vote, but feel we were grievously hoodwinked. We were told this was to join a major trading bloc and the rest of the agenda was kept very quiet. Is it the same this time? What is on the secret agenda, for I am sure there is one!“I voted for the UK to enter the Common Market too. Back then, I liked the idea of a federal Europe. Now I don't. The undemocratic treatment of Greece after they voted for a slower pace of austerity measures was one of the deciding factors.“I voted in the first time and will be voting 'remain' this time. In the years between, my husband has worked for a British company in Europe, earning money for the British economy, my son has lived and worked in Spain for over 20 years and we have retired to France. I want those opportunities for free movement to continue for the generations to come.In 40 years, much has changed for the 1975 referendum voters. Christopher and Philadelphia Stockwell were newly engaged consultants in London in 1975. Now, they run a holiday cottage business in the Cotswolds and have several grandchildren. They supported ""in"" in 1975 and will do so again in 2016.“We were born into a generation that experienced the longest period of peace in Europe that has ever been,” Philadelphia Stockwell, 65, explained. “It was an opportunity not to be missed, and we were right.”“Sovereignty is gained, not diminished, by working together,” Christopher Stockwell, 66, said. “It’s like a couple who get married -- they don’t lose their sovereignty, they get stronger together.”"

In the end, 67 percent voted to stay.Separated by four decades, there are striking parallels between the two referendums. In both cases, a new leader from a traditionally Euroskeptic political party came to power, pledged to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s relationship with Europe, and then gave people a vote on membership. Both times, the prime minister campaigned to remain in Europe with the support of the political opposition, while a vociferous branch of their own party demanded to leave. But there's one notable reversal -- in 1975, the ruling Euroskeptic party was the center-left Labour Party, and today, it's the center-right Conservative Party. A major reason for the political shift is that in 1975, the EEC was made up of nine countries, and the debate over membership focused primarily on economic issues -- Labour Party members were concerned about protecting British workers, and Conservatives were firm advocates of free trade.Today, the EU has 28 members and a vast array of functions, from protecting human rights to facilitating the free movement of citizens between nations. Conservatives are concerned about bureaucracy and national sovereignty, while trade unions say that EU policies actually help protect workers' rights and jobs.There are other major differences. In 1975, migration was a fringe issue in the referendum. The EEC didn’t yet allow citizens to move freely between states, and economically struggling Britain was, in any case, more concerned about people leaving the country than entering. This year, migration has been front and center in the debate, spurring xenophobia and scaremongering from British nationalist groups.Members of the generation that voted in the 1975 referendum and watched Europe develop into what it is today have strong feelings about Europe, and they are far from uniform.Gransnet, a British social networking site for older people, surveyed around 1,000 of its users earlier this year. Of those who voted to stay in the EEC in 1975, 36 percent said they would now vote to stay in the EU, while 38 percent said they would vote to leave. The WorldPost asked users of a Gransnet online forum if and how their views had changed since 1975. Here are some of their responses, which have been lightly edited and condensed:“I was born in 1943 and will be 73 in August. I voted 'in' last time we had a vote, but feel we were grievously hoodwinked. We were told this was to join a major trading bloc and the rest of the agenda was kept very quiet. Is it the same this time? What is on the secret agenda, for I am sure there is one!“I voted for the UK to enter the Common Market too. Back then, I liked the idea of a federal Europe. Now I don't. The undemocratic treatment of Greece after they voted for a slower pace of austerity measures was one of the deciding factors.“I voted in the first time and will be voting 'remain' this time. In the years between, my husband has worked for a British company in Europe, earning money for the British economy, my son has lived and worked in Spain for over 20 years and we have retired to France. I want those opportunities for free movement to continue for the generations to come.In 40 years, much has changed for the 1975 referendum voters. Christopher and Philadelphia Stockwell were newly engaged consultants in London in 1975. Now, they run a holiday cottage business in the Cotswolds and have several grandchildren. They supported ""in"" in 1975 and will do so again in 2016.“We were born into a generation that experienced the longest period of peace in Europe that has ever been,” Philadelphia Stockwell, 65, explained. “It was an opportunity not to be missed, and we were right.”“Sovereignty is gained, not diminished, by working together,” Christopher Stockwell, 66, said. “It’s like a couple who get married -- they don’t lose their sovereignty, they get stronger together.”"
41,WOMEN,This Ad Party Invite Is Straight Out Of ‘Mad Men’ — And Not In A Good Way,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cannes-lions-sexist-invitation_us_576ae600e4b0c0252e781bd9,"Strike one: Referring to women as ""females.""",2016-06-22,"Seriously, who thought this invitation was a good idea?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576ae7ee1500002a0073bfa1.jpeg?cache=tpZNDBGMJB&ops=crop_74_523_3791_2053%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sometimes, you just want to kick back and party without worrying about sexism. Unfortunately, we live in a world where that's not always possible.Tuesday, some participants in the Cannes Lions international advertising festival received a party invitation stipulating that only “attractive females and models” were welcome. The invitation was for The Wednesday Party, sponsored by Thrillist Media Group and digital agency VaynerMedia, AdWeek reports.Potential female guests were asked to send “recent untouched photos” or links to social media for review.Someone forwarded the email to advertising consultant and women’s advocate Cindy Gallop, who made it pretty clear on Twitter how she felt about the requirements:Both VaynerMedia CEO Gary Vaynerchuk and Thrillist CEO Ben Lerer said that they had nothing to do with the invitation, which came from a third-party promoter.“No one at Thrillist (or Vayner for that matter) knew anything about what this vendor was doing and we are clearly appalled by it,” wrote Lerer in an internal email forwarded to The Huffington Post. He also wrote they would no longer be working with the vendor and would be “more stringent” in selecting who they work with going forward.Vaynerchuk said in a video response to Gallop that he was “mortified” by the email and was trying to find out more details about how it came to be.When HuffPost called the number listed on the invitation, we repeatedly got a busy signal. However, a Google search links the number with events company iGetin. The company’s website appears to be down.Even so, it’s still a little alarming anyone thought this was a good idea in 2016.Luckily, Kathy Ruiz, creative director at ad agency NVRLND, had some helpful edits that they might want to take into consideration next time."

To merit the rating, the committee must find that the nominee has “outstanding legal ability and exceptional breadth of experience, and meet the very highest standards of integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament.”As a nonpartisan organization, the ABA maintained that the rating was not based on political affiliation or ideology.The ABA Standing Committee interviewed hundreds of legal professionals who have worked with Garland, and the overwhelming majority had nothing but praise for him. One commenter remarked, “Garland is the best that there is. He is the finest judge I have ever met. There is no one who is his peer.” Another suggested, “He may be the perfect human being.”Of the eight justices who currently serve on the Supreme Court, only Justice Clarence Thomas received an ABA rating lower than “well qualified” upon being nominated.In a statement released Tuesday, the White House lauded the ABA rating and chided the Senate for “abdicating” its responsibility to fill the court’s vacancy:Today, the American Bar Association gave its highest possible rating to Chief Judge Merrick Garland, assessing him as unanimously well-qualified and affirming he has the experience and character to serve on the United States Supreme Court. The ABA, one of the largest and most respected nonpartisan legal organizations in the country, joins a multitude of distinguished voices from across the political spectrum agreeing that Chief Judge Garland has a record of judicial excellence. The President nominated Chief Judge Garland 97 days ago - and given that the average time from nomination to confirmation is 67 days, there is no question that the Senate has abdicated its responsibility under the U.S. Constitution. Filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court is a solemn responsibility that the President and the Senate share under the Constitution, and we call on the Senate to do its job and consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to block Garland's confirmation, describing it as an ""11th hour"" move by President Barack Obama."

Call it Trumpism minus Trump, the New York real estate developer who has emerged as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in the 2016 U.S. elections.If British citizens vote on Thursday in favor of exiting the European Union, it would allow Britain to negotiate its own trade deals and better control who enters the country, among other things. Both sides in the polarized debate have mounted extensive campaigns and polls show the vote could be close.Trump, who will travel to Britain this week, supports the ""Leave"" camp, popularly known as Brexit. “I would personally be more inclined to leave, for a lot of reasons like having a lot less bureaucracy,” he told The Sunday Times.He has spent much of his presidential campaign warning of the dangers posed by undocumented immigrants from Mexico and refugees from the Middle East and has proposed building a wall along the southern border of the United States. Syrian refugees have also been center stage in the Brexit debate, with pro-exit forces arguing that Britain must do more to curb the flow of economic migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere.""I see similar themes on both sides of the Atlantic - a strong sense of threatened national identity, anti-globalization, nostalgia, and a sense that elites aren't accountable,"" said Wendy Rahn, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota who has studied Trump voters.Trump's campaign and the Brexit movement are two of the starkest examples of a new strain of conservative populism that stretches beyond the United States and Britain, into Sweden, France, Poland and elsewhere in Europe.KEEPING A DISTANCEAs with Trump’s candidacy, the Brexit forces have been marked by accusations of xenophobia. Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party - and like Trump, a businessman turned politician - earned widespread scorn last week for a poster showing a swell of Syrian refugees and warning Europe is at a ""breaking point.”More mainstream supporters of Brexit have kept their distance from figures like Farage. Similarly, some prominent Republicans in the United States, such as former White House candidates Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, have tried to separate themselves from Trump, who renewed his call last week for a ban on Muslims traveling to the United States.“We want to remain a free and open society,” Trump said, after a gunman killed 49 people in a mass shooting in Orlando. “Then, and if we do, then we have to control our borders.” Trump’s ascent has also been fueled by a disdain for political and financial elites, a hostility shared by Brexit advocates who say their interests are being ill-served by globalization.“Politicians are now just in it for themselves,” said Justin Bellhouse, an organizer for the “Leave” campaign in Bracknell, England.Bellhouse is no fan of Trump, whom he calls “ridiculous,” but he argued that controls on migration are needed to create more opportunity for British workers. American jobs for American workers is a favorite Trump theme.Brexit supporters mirror Trump voters, said Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, a pro-EU think tank based in London, in that they tend to be older, white, less affluent, and less likely to live in urban areas.Also, as Trump vows to “Make America Great Again,” Brexit backers are wistful for a bygone age.“There is a feeling among some that they’re trying to get back to when Britain was white, when England was more secure,” Grant said.Trump's support for Brexit has been seized upon by U.S. political consultants advising the groups that oppose the referendum, including Jim Messina, who ran U.S. President Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2012.“Trump’s advice on Brexit would lead UK economy the same place his Atlantic City casinos ended up: LOSER,” Messina tweeted last month.(Reporting by James Oliphant and Emily Stephenson.
