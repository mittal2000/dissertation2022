Boston Market said in a statement that it will have salt shakers available at a condiment station, but that this change will prompt customers to taste their food first before automatically putting more salt on. The restaurant is also going down the path of other restaurants in lowering sodium levels. Signature items -- mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and rotisserie chicken -- will get a 20 percent decrease in sodium, while other menu items will get a 15 percent decrease in sodium by 2014, Boston Market said in the statement. ""By removing salt shakers from Boston Market tables, we hope to raise awareness of salt intake, without completely eliminating the option, to those who dine in our restaurants,"" Boston Market CEO George Michel said in the statement. ""Today, we are publicly committing to further reduce sodium from menu items while still delivering the great taste for which Boston Market is known."" Center for Science in the Public Interest director Michael Jacobson told USA Today that this is the first time he's heard of a restaurant making a point to remove salt shakers from its tables. Last year, a number of restaurants made headlines for decreasing the sodium in their menu items. Particularly, Carl's Jr.'s hamburger buns, El Torito's sauces and Taco Bell's entire menu have been subject to a decrease in sodium, the Los Angeles Times reported. ""Everybody in the industry is looking at sodium reduction,"" CKE restaurants marketing chief Brad Haley told the LA Times. CKE restaurants owns Carl's Jr. and Hardee's. ""Because we think this is the next legislative requirement that is going to come down.""The body needs some salt to function, but it's easy to get too much, especially considering processed and pre-prepared foods are loaded with the stuff, the Mayo Clinic reported. Consuming too much salt is known to raise blood pressure, which can lead to other problems like heart failure, stroke and heart disease. The most sodium we should be eating a day is 2,300 milligrams, according to the Mayo Clinic. The government's recommended level is even lower for people who are over the age of 50, have high blood pressure, are African American or have chronic kidney disease or diabetes -- for these groups of people, it's 1,500 milligrams per day. Recently, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed there are 10 kinds of foods that make up 44 percent of all the sodium we eat each day, with 65 percent of that sodium coming from store-bought foods and 25 percent coming from restaurant foods.That report showed that the average person's daily diet includes 3,300 milligrams of sodium, which doesn't even include added salt that you might sprinkle on top of a dish at the table.

Fried chicken is a little too heavy and a little too greasy to eat 365 days a year -- especially if you're getting that fried chicken from the store or a take-out restaurant. But when it's homemade, and when it's this fried chicken recipe, it's worth the indulgence. Not because this recipe is healthier than others -- it definitely isn't -- but just because it's one of the best fried chicken recipes we've come across; way better than anything you could buy.

(Photo by Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2b632100003000c504e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rosie O'Donnell had a heart attack last week after helping a woman from her car, according to news reports. O'Donnell, 50, did not call 911 as she experienced the symptoms -- nausea, pain, and feeling hot. But she did take a Bayer aspirin -- ""saved by a tv commercial, literally"" she wrote on her blog -- before seeing a cardiologist the next day. She wrote on her blog that her left anterior descending artery was 99 percent blocked (what is dubbed a ""Widow Maker"" heart attack). She had a stent put in to open up the blocked artery. ""Know the symptoms ladies, listen to the voice inside, the one we all so easily ignore, CALL 911,"" O'Donnell wrote on her blog. So how did aspirin help to save O'Donnell's life? Well first, it's important to understand how a heart attack forms in the first place. In general, a heart attack occurs when artery-blocking plaques rupture. When this rupture occurs, blood cells called platelets come to the surface. The Harvard Medical School Family Health Guide explains why this is dangerous: Platelets are the tiny blood cells that trigger blood clotting. A clot, or thrombus, builds up on the ruptured plaque. As the clot grows, it blocks the artery. If the blockage is complete, it deprives a portion of the heart muscle of oxygen. As a result, muscle cells die â€”- and it's a heart attack.The sooner aspirin is taken once a heart attack occurs, the better. That's because aspirin works by stopping platelets from building up, in essence thinning the blood, the American Heart Association reported. And you don't have to take a lot of aspirin -- just a little bit is all it takes to have the inhibitory effect, according to the Harvard Medical School Family Health Guide.Aspirin isn't just useful during a heart attack -- the American Heart Association recommends taking aspirin to help prevent heart attack in high-risk people, or in people who have already once suffered a heart attack. However, it's important to talk to your doctor before starting a daily aspirin regimen, as it may not be right for people with certain conditions or in certain low-risk people, the American Heart Association noted. ABC News reported on a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that taking 300 milligrams (or less) of aspirin a day could increase bleeding risks in the stomach and brain by 55 percent.""If the risk of having a cardiovascular event is low, then the risk of bleeding will likely offset any beneficial effect of aspirin,"" the researcher of that study, Dr. Antonio Nicolucci, told ABC News.

3,MONEY,Facebook: Great Social Platform... Bad Investment,"Ike Ikokwu, Contributor
The Financial Independence Coach",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-great-social-pla_us_5b9c2acfe4b03a1dcc7cc82e,"So while Facebook was once a great social media platform, both individual and corporate users are calling to question its relevance and the return on investment from using this platform.",2012-08-21,"FILE - In this May 16, 2012 file photo, the Facebook logo is displayed on an iPad in Philadelphia. Facebook's stock hit a new low Friday, July 27, 2012, after it reported second-quarter results that disappointed investors. The stock fell $3.90, or nearly 15 percent, to $22.94 in morning trading Friday. Facebook Inc.'s initial public offering of stock priced at $38, and its low had been $25.52, hit on June 6. The stock is now about 39 percent below its IPO price. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2acf1f00005000211ded.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The creation of Facebook as a social media platform changed our lives forever. There were great stories of decade old reunions with long-lost friends from high school. Then there was talk about the subscriber base for Facebook approaching one billion subscribers in record time. Everywhere you turned, someone was singing the company's praises.When the topic of search dominance came up, the consensus was that Facebook would out- muscle Google in this space since it has so much unique information on consumer tastes and preferences. With all of that going for it, an investment in Facebook's IPO seemed certain to return a 50 percent gain as similar investments in technology companies from the year 2000 would do in record time. Expectations were somewhat met as there has been a 50 percent move in the value of its stock since its IPO. However, that move has been to the downside not up. As of Friday, August 17, 2012 close, Facebook's stock price was hovering right at around $19 a share... a full 50 percent decline from its IPO price in May of 2012. For many that purchased shares of stock at its IPO price, that's been a sure bet on how to lose the money game.Not all players in the Facebook money game have been losers though. I know of several investors, whose names will not be disclosed for obvious reasons, that profited by selling short shares of the stock after its IPO. Those investors have ""show me the money"" as their ring tone on their cell phones when you call them. It has indeed been a profitable move for them. So the question is with so much hype following the IPO, what did these investors know that others didn't?I can assure you that it was not a matter of having insider information as it was a matter of being prudent, wise, and using some common sense. Public information on Facebook indicated that the fundamentals on the company didn't add up. The likely post-IPO market value of $100 billion gave some clues as to what the market was saying each individual with a Facebook page was worth to the company.... about $100. At face value that might seem reasonable but when you look deeper into Facebook's financials you find that each user only generated about $4 in sales for the company in 2011. That creates a huge vacuum of advertising revenue that would need to be generated to get to the post-IPO valuation numbers. Worse yet, Facebook's advertising revenue actually fell in the first quarter of 2012 from the fourth quarter of 2011.Another troublesome issue was how the structure of the IPO kept changing right up until the last-minute. And, with each change, it appeared to just get worse for investors. One example of that was the fact that rather than having the normal 180 day lockup provision, which limits how quickly pre-IPO shareholders can sell their shares after the IPO, Facebook's IPO structure had an unusually short lockup period of only 91 days. So if you do the math, it is of no coincidence to me that on Friday, August 19, 2012 the stock reached a new low of $19... approximately 91 days after the IPO on Friday, May 18, 2012.To add insult to injury, recent reports released in June of 2012 by Reuters and research firm Ipsos, shows that about one in three Facebook users are getting bored with the social network. That does not bode well for the company or its stock. As if that were not enough, Carolyn Everson, Facebook's Vice President of Marketing has been having difficulty winning over skeptical advertising executives who complained that spending on the giant social network wasn't paying off.So while Facebook was once a great social media platform, both individual and corporate users are calling to question its relevance and the return on investment from using this platform. While those questions are still up in the air, one that isn't at this point is if an investment in its IPO was a good move. Whether it's Facebook or another company, a singular investment in an IPO is usually at best a gamble. Your odds at winning may be better at the slot machine in Vegas. To win the money game, you should invest in fundamentally sound companies that are part of a broadly diversified portfolio. Placing all your chips on one company is a gamble you should avoid.Apply these principles to help you win the money game!"
