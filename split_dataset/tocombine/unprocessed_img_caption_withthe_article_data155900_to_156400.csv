1,FOOD & DRINK,A Lime Cut Three Ways: The First Cut,"Brian Silverman, Contributor
Food and travel writer based in New York. Author of the websit...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/caipirinha-recipe_us_5b9d1e75e4b03a1dcc849a7b,"Caipirinhas may require a little sweat, but they're well worth the effort.",2013-05-03,Caipirinha - One the of most popular Brazilian drinks.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1e752200003000d97fff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My first exposure to Brazilian food, if you can call it that, was at a three-level place in New York's theater district called Cabana Carioca. At lunch on all three levels, there was an ""all you can eat"" buffet where rice and beans, plantains, potatoes, hearts of palm salad, baby shrimp salad, chorizo, roast chicken and macaroni were some of the offerings. Depending what level you ate, you paid a given amount. The higher you climbed, the cheaper the buffet.On the main level was a standard, somewhat formal restaurant. I don't think I ever ate there, but maybe I did. I just don't remember. The second level, where the kitchen was located, was a bit more casual than the main level and the most popular of the three. It was on the second level where I ate most of my meals. The third level was bare bones; dark and usually empty -- used probably only when the other two levels were packed or for private parties, but still serving the restaurants' enormous portions of steaks, fish, shrimp and the specialty: feijoada, also known as the ""Brazilian National Dish.""Cabana Carioca's feijoada came in a cast iron pot stuffed with black beans and a variety of meats; pork shoulder, chorizo, kidney, beef and other cuts that at the time, I could not identify. They were all coated in the black gravy of the beans and, really, since by then I was probably on my second or third caipirinha, no longer cared what I might be shoveling into my mouth.Along with the alcohol's numbing effect, the caipirinha, as opposed to beer, helped cut through the density of the feijoada and made it much easier to navigate. The only problem was the next day's hangover from too much cachaca, the Brazilian spirit made from pressed and then distilled sugar cane juice and used to make the caipirinha.I think the last time I had a caipirinha at Cabana Carioca was in 1998 watching Brazil lose to France in the World Cup. The restaurant, all three levels, closed soon after and now, both its caipirinha and feijoada are just memories.I've never had the fortitude to try to resurrect the feijoada in my kitchen, but the caipirinha is a frequent guest. The ingredients are simple; cachaca (available at most liquor stores), sugar, ice, and of course limes. Despite the easy ingredients, making a really good caipirinha requires a little sweat, or, as they used to say, ""elbow grease."" The result, however, is well worth the effort.What follows is the first in the ""Lime Cut Three Ways"" trilogy: The CaipirinhaIngredients:1 or 2 limes2 to 3 ounces of cachaca*2 to 3 teaspoons of sugar syrup **3-5 ice cubes*Spirit importers are beginning to market ""premium"" cachaca, which really just translates into a glitzy bottle design along with an upscale marketing campaign all in the hopes of selling a much higher priced product. I advise you not to go that route when purchasing cachaca for your caipirinhas. In Brazil there are two very popular brands that are used at most restaurants and clubs in making caipirinhas and they can be found here for well under $20 a liter. Seek them out. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.**Most caipirinha recipes call for granulated sugar. I prefer pre-made sugar syrup thus skipping the ""dissolving"" process that is necessary in making the drink. To make simple sugar syrup, combine equal amounts of sugar and water, bring to a boil, lower the heat and let cook until the granules have dissolved. The syrup will last for weeks in your refrigerator. I like to use Demerara brown sugar for my syrup, but basic white sugar works just as well.To make the caipirinha you will need:1 lime muddler.  Cocktail shaker and strainer.Cut the lime into eight or 10pieces.Toss the lime pieces into the cocktail shaker and using your muddler, it can be a pestle, if you have a mortar and pestle, or anything that can mash and muddle lime pieces, muddle mash the lime, extracting the juice from both the rind and the pulp. Don't be stingy with that aforementioned elbow grease.Add the sugar syrup, cachaca and a some ice cubes.Shake vigorously and then strain into an ice cube filled glass.Do not be fooled by the drink's petite size. It will be tempting to down it in a few gulps, but try to sip slowly. Drinking the caipirinha too hastily will only mean a quicker return to the kitchen and more work for you to make another."
2,TRAVEL,New Orleans and All Its Jazz,"Dwight Brown, Contributor
Film critic, entertainment journalist and travel writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-orleans-and-all-its-j_us_5b9d1f0de4b03a1dcc84a3e4,"The stately, 48-story, 1,100-room Sheraton New Orleans at 500 Canal Street is centrally located and just steps away from",2013-05-03,"New Orleans Hosts the Annual, Popular New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1ef12500003500365493.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Yes New Orleans, Louisiana is steeped in history, culture, fine arts and friendly gregarious people. And all those ingredients seem to peak every April when the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival takes center stage. Thousands of music lovers sojourn to a city that already has a rhythm all its on. Wine flows, tasty food is served, the sidewalks are crowded, nightclubs jump and music fills the air. The Big Easy Has Big MusicMusic is New Orleans magic elixir. It's everywhere. Musicians serenade you on sidewalks, street corners, in restaurants, at hotels ... It is no wonder that the city has created arguably the nation's most celebrated musical soiree, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Started in 1970 with Mahalia Jackson and Duke Ellington at Congo Square near the French Quarter, it now has relocated to Fair Grounds Race Course, the third-oldest racetrack in America (circa 1872). The fest runs the last weekend in April and the first weekend of May and features local bands, international artists and music legends who perform on so many stages you can barely count them. The Acura stage presents pop music greats and legends: Maroon 5, John Mayer, Billy Joel, Dr. John, and Allen Toussaint. Gentilly hosts rock acts: Ben Harper, Gary Clark Jr., and Patti Smith. Congo Square presents soul acts: George Benson, Earth Wind & Fire, and Jill Scott. There's a Gospel Tent, Blues Tent, Jazz Tent, Kids Tent, a Pavilion for Native American Music ... The liveliest venue is the Sheraton's Fais Do Do stage, which features French Canadian Roots music and other Americana styles (Le Vent du Nord of Canada, Terrence Simien & the Zydeco Experience with special guest Queen Ida). It's the one place where people dance all day. Crowds also flock here for the food. You'll find collards greens, fried chicken livers and chicken wings at Praline Connection's stand. Kajun Kettle's famous Crawfish Monica dish has been a festival staple for 30 years. Chef Pierre Hilzim created a spicy cream sauce, tossed it with pasta and crawfish tails and named it for his wife, Monica. Eat Till You Can' Lift Your Fork!If music is the city's elixir, food is its aphrodisiac. Brennan's Restaurant, a near 70-year-old grand dame eatery, is famed for its elaborate brunches and inventing the pyrotechnic dessert Bananas Foster. Start breakfast with a sublime Brandy Milk Punch, followed by New Orleans Turtle Soup, Eggs Hussarde (Poached eggs atop Holland rusks, Canadian bacon and Marchand de Vin sauce. Topped with Hollandaise sauce). Finish with Bananas Foster, bananas saut√©ed in butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and banana liqueur, and then flamed in rum. Served over vanilla ice cream. Dickie Brennan's Steakhouse, headed by master chef Alfred Singleton, serves the city's best beef (iron skillet-seared strip steak, oven-baked prime rib, grilled Ribeye), but that's only the beginning: For appetizers Seared Crawfish Cakes; then hearty Seafood Gumbo; move on to the Creole Seasoned Sirloin Strip; end the night with the signature Coconut Cake.Arnauds favors Creole and traditional New Orleans cuisine. Taste the Alligator Sausage, then the Veal Wohl, it's a sampler main course of Veal Chantal, Arnaud's Crab Cake and Crawfish O'Connor. Perhaps the most visually stunning restaurant in New Orleans is Palace Caf√© on Canal Street, which looks like a large two-story French bistro with a dramatic spiral staircase and murals of musicians that evoke a jazzy spirit: The house specialty is the fluffy starter Crabmeat Cheesecake. For the main event go for the delectable Andouille Crusted Fish and dessert must be the White Chocolate Bread Pudding. The newest addition to NOLA's top tier restaurants is Tableau. Their unique balcony dining space has coveted views of Jackson Square. Try the Crabmeat Ravigote to start and end with the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert. NOLA Goes Way BackNative American settlements in this region, that is set between the Mississippi river and Lake Pontchartrain, date back to 400 A.D. The French (fur trappers, traders--a swarthy bunch) came next, establishing the city of Nouvelle-Orl√©ans in 1718. Spain gained New Orleans and Louisiana as a concession from their defeat in the Seven Years War in 1763, only to give New Orleans back to the French in 1800. Then Napoleon sold it to the U.S. in 1803 in the historic Louisiana Purchase. Whites, Free Blacks, and Slaves inhabited the city. Two centuries later, New Orleans has become a multicultural, international commerce center with the largest seaport in the world and a tourist mecca. Culture Reigns SupremeWhen you view Mardi Gras on TV, you see revelers standing on second-story verandas, throwing beaded necklaces down to pedestrians on the street. That mayhem is on Bourbon Street, in the French Quarter, on a week that leads up to Fat Tuesday. People on Bourbon St. let lose. The lane is lined with bars, strip clubs, and lively music joints (Pazzoo) with barkers outside beckoning patrons. It's quite the scene, and that laissez faire attitude includes being able to legally walk around NOLA with a cocktail in your hand. It's as normal as rain. Speaking of normal, New Orleans is a slow-paced, friendly city. That's the vibe. There is no such thing as fast. Slow down. Slow your roll. Locals say, ""Hello,"" ""Good Afternoon,"" ""Thank You."" You should too, it's part of the culture. Around the TownVenture away from tourist-heavy Bourbon Street. Take in a show at the House of Blues on Decatur Street. Walk down Royal Street and go shopping for antiques (Keil's Antiques) or paintings (Galerie d'art Francais). Head to Jackson Square where a statue of Andrew Jackson on his steed anchors the sculpted lawns and flowers. St. Louis Cathedral (oldest still operating cathedral in the U.S.), Cabildo (site of the Louisiana Purchase signing) and The Presbyt√®re (a museum) sit like majestic sentries. This open space is bordered by upscale boutiques and cafes and its old world flavor mixes well with the new city charms. Head down the hotel-lined Canal Street, which is divided by palm trees and streetcar car tracks, to the Mississippi River where there's a harbor, a ferry building and Harrah's Casino, in case you're determined to lose your rent money. Take a two-hour cruise on the NATCHEZ, the last authentic Mississippi steamboat. Enjoy Golden Fried Pangasius Fish for lunch as you get a detailed narrative profile of the sights: The 9th Ward neighborhood which was badly flooded during Hurricane Katrina; the battlefield for the War of 1812's Battle of New Orleans; the Crescent City Connection Bridge. Ride a streetcar down St. Charles Street where the Mardi Gras parade runs and you'll pass Loyola and Tulane Universities and the stately mansions of the Uptown neighborhood. Go to the Contemporary Arts Center which hosts exhibits like Beyond ""Beasts"": The Art of Court 13; new work and early films by Oscar-nominated Beasts of the Southern Wild director Benh Zeitlin and his New Orleans-based Court 13 film collective. Or visit the Faubourg Treme neighborhood. It's considered to be the oldest black neighborhood in America, the origin of the Southern Civil Rights Movement and the birthplace of jazz You can hit some tennis balls with tennis pro Gerald Davis or head pro Corey Clarke at the City Park/Pepsi Tennis Center in the 1,300 acre City Park. There are golf courses, an equestrian center, the New Orleans Museum of Art & Sculpture Garden... The New Orleans Haunted History Tour, guided by Ernest Sylvester, starts at the Rev. Zombie's Voodoo Shop, 723 St. Peter Street and ends at the Saint Louis Cemetery Number One, where Homer Plessy of the famous Supreme Court case ""Plessy VS Ferguson"" is buried. A Room With A ViewThe stately, 48-story, 1,100-room Sheraton New Orleans at 500 Canal Street is centrally located and just steps away from Bourbon Street and the riverfront. All the streetcars pass by their front door. Roux Bistro, on the second floor, features traditional and innovative New Orleans-inspired cuisine and serves a very savory Grilled New York Sirloin Steak with mushroom and fries. Follow it with their Big Apple pie topped with crisp granola and caramel sauce. After dinner, go down to the lobby-floor Pelican Bar; it's great for people watching long into the night. And during the festival don't be surprised if you find musicians like the guys from Earth Wind & Fire riding alongside you in the elevator. The hotel's vast health club features Sheraton Fitness Programmed by Core Performance¬Æ. With tips on nutrition, strength-training machines, weight benches & free-weights, Life Fitness Signature Series cardio equipment pieces and an outdoor pool the club has plenty of ways to help you fight off the pounds you'll gain by eating all the great food in NOLA. You'll Want To Come Back. You'll Want To Stay!There are lots of good reasons to come back to New Orleans: May--New Orleans Food and Wine Experience. July--Essence Music Festival. October--New Orleans Film Festival. December--New Year's Eve French Quarter Celebration & Fireworks. Late February early March--Mardi Gras. April--PGA's Zurich Classic Golf Tournament and the Jazz Fest.Local folklore has it that if you find a lover or spouse in New Orleans you will never leave.

Find out their answers in our series, Homecoming Meals.We would be pretty surprised if you are even remotely interested in talking and reading about food, and hadn't ever heard of Bobby Flay. This hyper-exposed, grill-focused chef was one of the original Food Network stars, and helped -- whether he likes it or not -- contribute to the rise of the celebrity chef. As a restaurateur, television star and ultra-competitive chef, Bobby is a perfect candidate to talk about Homecoming Meals because it doesn't seem like he gets to be home all that much? Like most of our busy interviewees before him, his favorite recipes to return home to are simple, satisfying and remind him of home. It‚Äôs usually something very comforting. It‚Äôs probably going to be a cheeseburger or some fried chicken. My wife and I like really comforting food and we don‚Äôt eat on airplanes so basically if we‚Äôre coming from L.A. or somewhere overseas, it‚Äôs a really long trip so we have a long time to think about what we want. And it‚Äôs never going to be a salad, I can tell you that. It‚Äôs going to be something that has some substance to it and it‚Äôs usually going to be comfort food, so fried chicken, a roasted chicken, a cheeseburger or maybe like a porter house steak.Thanks for the fried chicken tips, Bobby!

Learning how to deal with stresses before they happen can increase the odds that your marriage will last. Here are five tips on handling the most common stresses you'll likely encounter in the life of your marriage.,2013-05-03,A man and woman holding a heart on top of a mountain peak,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1c8a1f00002d00217b61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As wedding season begins, and so many couples are walking down the aisle, I ponder how many couples will make it last. Life is filled with ups and downs and not every couple can navigate through them. Learning how to deal with stresses even before they happen can greatly increase the odds that your marriage will last. Here are five tips on handling the most common stresses you'll likely encounter in the life of your marriage.1) Trauma: Emotional or Physical:Whether it's the death of a relative, one of you losing your job or problems conceiving a child, you and your spouse are bound to face some sort of trauma. During these times, people will advise that you and your spouse should comfort each other, but when two people are going through the same emotional trauma, they'll likely deal with it in very different ways. Women often want to talk about their feelings a lot, while men may turn inward and try to deal with their feelings themselves. Neither way is better, what's important is to keep the lines of communication open with your spouse and to let them know how you're doing. Girlfriends will listen to you over and over again, but men aren't built that way and will eventually begin to tune out. When men tune out, women get hurt so to avoid that, love each other, but don't overburden each other.2) When one partner's not happy with their life:When one partner feels unhappy with their life that can be transferred into the marriage, even if their unhappiness has nothing to do with the marriage. For example, if their boss at work makes their life miserable, they may come home stressed and aggravated which can come out on the spouse inadvertently and affect the entire household. In order to live in a happy home, it's important to pay attention to your feelings and try to deal with them in a constructive way. Women will listen to men complain about their job incessantly, as long as they feel their husband is still happy to come home to them.3) Parenting: Children are a major cause of stress in a marriage. Many parents will tell you that their marriages were amazing until they had kids. That's not to say that we don't love our children and wish they weren't here, but having children can cause more conflicts within marriage. We are products of the way we were raised and since your spouse was raised differently, they'll have different ideas of what's best for the children. With parenting there are many issues that come up on a daily basis, whether it's how to discipline or what chores the kids should have. One spouse may believe that children should work hard for their allowances; while another feels they should get allowance just for being a part of the family. There are lots of emotions that come in to raising little blank slates and these can be the biggest battles you and your spouse may have. In these cases, there has to be some compromising. Kids need to see that you're both on the same side, even if they realize the two of you don't agree on the issue, the fact that you both stick together on the result is all that matters. Undermining each other is what gives kids power and believe me, you don't want a fourteen year old to have more power in your household than you do. If they do, it will be pizza, chocolate and dirty jokes all day long,4) Money:  Money is one of the main causes of divorce, which includes people who have it as well as people who don't. If you're a spender and your spouse isn't, there can be resentment. People have varying views on money and finding a place that you can both agree on, can be difficult. In reality, money should not be a major issue. If the bills are paid every month and you're saving for retirement as well as an emergency fund, you should each be able to spend money on ""fun."" In any given month one spouse will spend more than the other, but that should not be an issue as long as it's fair overall. Fairness is the most important thing, because that's really all people are striving for. 5) Sex:  When you first get married, you're having sex all the time, but as the years pass, your sex life changes. That isn't to say it won't be even better, but the frequency will definitely change. Problems happen when one partner wants sex more than the other partner. This can make the partner who wants more sex resentful of the one who wants less. Wanting less sex doesn't mean you love the person less; it's just the way the hormones are reacting within your body. To keep the resentment out of the bedroom, each person has to compromise on their needs. We all have our signals that we use to let our partner subtly know whether we're in the mood or not so. Pay attention to those signals and try to be more understanding. I've always hated when people say that marriage takes hard work, not because it doesn't, but because the word 'work' implies no fun and there can be, and should be, a great deal of fun within your marriage. Marriage can be filled with stresses, but learning how to deal with them can you keep yours strong and happy."

His culinary skills landed him a spot on Season 8 of Bravo's Top Chef and his work has reached hundreds of national television and print outlets, including The Travel Channel's No Reservations, The Today Show, CNN's Next List, The New York Times and many others. Learn more about what makes Chef Farina tick and how he turned his passion into a successful career: 1. How do you keep your dishes creative and unexpected? What inspires you? I keep my dishes creative and unexpected by always challenging myself. I try to use ""plates"" that aren't plates (i.e. vases or rocks), and I also make my own plates out of natural items like logs to make birch syrup dispensers.2. What is your favorite dish to prepare?  My favorite dish to prepare right now is the Surf & Turf course. It is based off of the umami flavors or mushrooms and seaweed. It looks like sand mushrooms and seaweed. The proteins are duck tongue and halibut cheeks.3. Was there a moment (or perhaps a meal) that motivated you to become a chef?  My first job making pizza inspired me to become a chef. 4. How do you stay energized and engaged during such long shifts? I stay energized and engaged during my long shifts by having fun, such as by listening to music or watching YouTube videos. I like to create a fun atmosphere at work because if you are having fun and love what you do, you don't feel like you are working.5. Has post-modern cuisine always appealed to you? I've always kind of been interested in post-modern cuisine. However, it was the time I dined at WD-50 that really solidified this interest. When I ate there it was the most mind-blowing food I had ever seen and it made me want to make food in that style. It's fun to be creative and post-modern cuisine always drives me to be creative as I can be.6. Who is your chef inspiration or mentor? As far as a chef that inspires me I would say Heston Blumenthal. He is self-taught and has a unique way of looking at food. As far as a mentor, I have two: Lenny DeGeorge (who was the first chef I worked for) and Chris Jones (the last CDC at moto). Chris molded me from a creative cook into a chef.7. What is one thing that guests should keep in mind when dining at moto in order to make the most of their experience? When guests eat at Moto, they should remember to have fun to get the most out of their meal.8. What would be your last meal and who would prepare it?  My last meal would be my grandma's eggplant Parmesan and salad... made by her, of course.9. What made you decide to collect vinyl toys and do you think you will ever put your ice carving skills to use at moto?  I decided to collect vinyl toys because the art of them is great and they are sold in blind boxes so you never know what you're going to get. And I put my ice carving skills to the test at Moto every winter. I do at least one holiday themed multi-block piece. Last year I made a 10-block scene of Santa's sleigh, a reindeer and a Christmas tree.10. What is your biggest pet peeve when dining out? My biggest pet peeve when eating out is under-seasoned food.11. What is your must-have kitchen tool or gadget? A good metal saucing spoon.12. What is the funniest/most embarrassing mistake you ever made as a chef?  Probably being the second person eliminated from Top Chef Season 9. I finally made the show after trying out three times and I messed it up by not making good chili. I put a lot of pressure on myself to do well and I feel like I failed on national television.13. What is next for postmodern cuisine? What do you see in the culinary future?  I believe many great techniques have been discovered, so in the future, the focus will be on the guest experience from the time they enter until they leave. The presentation of the food will also get more creative and out-of-the-box, and the crazier way to present food will prevail."

After all, a mediator isn't a marriage counselor, and isn't charged with the responsibility of determining whether and when to call it quits. So this raises a few questions: Can a troubled marriage really be saved? Is the relationship really worth saving? And finally, do we need a mediator?If a person needs help losing weight, should he just give up without trying? If an addict feels helpless to live a clean life, should she succumb to the addiction and not seek help? Anything worth having is worth fighting for, and marriage is no different. Building a life together with another person is like building a road. The design of the road is planned ahead of time, but as the concrete is laid, there may be obstacles encountered that require the road to take certain twists and turns. These adjustments, if appropriately managed, may only result in little cracks in the road that can be repaired with some attention. But if ignored, these same little cracks can turn into giant, seemingly irreparable craters. The timing of when you seek marital maintenance may be the difference between whether you need a marriage counselor or a mediator. Conventional wisdom holds that marriage counselors are in the business of fixing relationships, while mediators are in the business of dismantling them. As a mediator by profession and a hopeless romantic by birth, that sounds pretty dreary, so I look at it a bit differently. Instead of simply ripping apart relationships, the role of a mediator is one of facilitating the dissolution of a marriage by carefully redefining the couple as individuals, and gently extricating their financial and emotional lives so that they can move forward as two separate people. The mediator works closely with both individuals to identify problems and find creative solutions without resorting to litigation. In contrast, marriage counselors are in the business of improving relationships. According relationship expert, Jonathan Zalesne, founder of Fort Collins Family Counseling in Fort Collins, Colorado, ""When a couple comes to see me for marital counseling, I see the relationship as my client, not the individuals sitting before me. I tell them up front that, until they tell me that they have given up, I will never stop fighting for their relationship. So long as there is not abuse or an unsafe power differential, I believe that the relationship needs an advocate, and that is how I define my job.""Though it seems counter-intuitive, marriage counselors and family law mediators are not at opposite ends of the spectrum. There are times when both the sound advice of a marriage counselor and the facilitations by a mediator can help couples cope before, during and after a divorce. Like a road, a marriage is a continual work in progress, requiring re-mapping, planning adjustments and maintenance. And sometimes you need to rip out the road and take a train. As you and your spouse grow and change, your relationship inevitably changes as well. Sometimes the changes cause stress in the relationship. And sometimes they kill it. Only you can determine whether your relationship is worth saving. As Zalesne says, ""If your marriage counselor tells you to get a divorce, find a new marriage counselor.""So what determines which professional to choose? Must you select one over the other? Look for future articles that will discuss signs that you need a marriage counselor and how to choose one, how to identify and select a mediator, and more information regarding the various professionals who can help before, during and after your divorce.Questions about your relationship?

You can now cross ""read an article about tacos, that also mentions Leonardo Da Vinci"" off your bucket list! Tacos are simple. They all contain some type of tortilla or tortilla substitute, wrapped around some kind of meat and/or vegetable, with cheese or some other accoutrements. The news of Taco Bell ringing in $2.5b annually can be attributed to the growing love for the delicious, but simple Mexican dish. With so few components to the taco, and such fervor for the faire, restaurants around the country have engaged in an arms race to build the most creative variations of the dish. As of 2013, here are some of the most popular and unique tacos in the U.S. today. EATERS NOTE: This article is going to be a two-part article. Part one will be about the amazing, but often ignored outside of the taco. Part two will look at all the deliciousness between the sheets (tortilla). Outside the Tortilla:Junk Food-Wrapped Tacos Unless you are √úber healthy or have not turned on a TV, computer or radio, you are already well aware of Taco Bell's introduction of the ""Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos."" For those unfamiliar, the concept is a regular Taco Bell taco, dressed up with a ""Doritos Cool Ranch"" taco shell. For stoners and snack food aficionados, this is a marriage of two very wonderful things. At current, this is by far the most talked-about taco on the internet. It's good enough to remain that way for some time.Interesting Fact: The introduction of the Cool Ranch Taco created 15,000 jobs at Taco Bell according to HuffPost.More Info: This guy reviews all fast-food products. What a country!Wonton-Wrapped Tacos When you think Tommy Bahama, I'm sure creative Mexican food doesn't come to mind. I used to share those same reservations, until dining at the Tommy Bahama restaurant in Wailea. To the heavens, I am a convert! Their food is both delicious and creative, and no dish represents that more than their Ahi Tuna Wonton Tacos. Using a wonton shell instead of a tortilla is a unique change both for my tongue and my taste buds. The dish has high popularity within whatsGOOD and is one of the more unique tacos in the U.S. Beauty & Essex in NYC also has its own variation that gets mentioned in the same breath as the Tommy Bahama wonton taco.Bacon Tacos, Or ""Bacos"" ""Bacon-anything"" is going to put comments at the bottom of this article. Same goes for ""taco- anything."" Some enterprising chef at PYT in Philadelphia recognized this cultural formula and combined them to make ""Bacos."" The taco shell is three to four strips of bacon pan-fused together filled with traditional beef, lettuce, pico de gallo and veggies on the inside. Are you drooling yet? When they made the announcement it sent the internet into a frenzy and will likely spawn ba-clones throughout the country this year. It's only going to be served for a limited time, so get to Philly and get it while you can.
