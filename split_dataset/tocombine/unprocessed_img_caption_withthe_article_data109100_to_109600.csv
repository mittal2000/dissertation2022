0,POLITICS,Gay Marriage Finds Scant Mention Among Republicans At Values Voter Summit,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gay-marriage-gop_n_5891030.html,,2014-09-26,"WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 26: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) speaks at the 2014 Values Voter Summit September 26, 2014 in Washington, DC. The Family Research Council (FRC) hosting its 9th annual Values Voter Summit inviting conservatives to participate in a straw poll. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d75d2100002501c965c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The need to preserve ""traditional"" marriage was on the minds of many at the opening day of Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of religious conservatives in Washington. It was on the lips of event organizers, a topic of debate at several panels, and the mission of many groups assembled there. But it received much less attention from prominent Republicans who spoke at the event than in previous years.While many talked about abortion and the right to life, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was one of few who spoke about marriage. But even Cruz did so in passing.""How do we win? We defend the values that are American values. We stand for life. We stand for marriage. We stand for Israel. We bring back jobs and opportunity and unleash small businesses to make it easier for people to achieve the American dream. We abolish the IRS. We repeal Common Core,"" Cruz said, to resounding applause on the latter point.The conservative firebrand addressed ""religious liberty"" several times, but only in the context of the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision. He denounced the so-called birth control mandate in the Affordable Care Act, and criticized Democrats for fighting groups that have sought Obamacare exemptions because they say it goes against their values.Contrary to Cruz's evangelist approach, which won him standing ovations from the friendly crowd several times, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) struck a more professorial tone. The libertarian-leaning senator called for the end of U.S. aid to nations that persecute Christians, and offered a sharp critique of the Obama administration's broader war in the Middle East. But Paul, too, strayed away from mentions of gay marriage, devoting his remarks largely to foreign policy.Rep. Michele Bachmann's (R-Minn.) ardent opposition to gay marriage is well known. The former GOP presidential candidate campaigned tirelessly for her state's same-sex marriage ban, only to see it legalized in 2013. But her remarks at the Values Voter Summit had nary a mention of the hot-button issue.Addressing a journalist following her speech, Bachmann, who is retiring from Congress this year, said gay marriage was “not an issue anymore."" ""In fact it’s boring,"" she added.Even Sarah Palin, a darling of the conservative movement long after her failed bid for the vice presidency in 2008, stayed clear of the subject.Rick Santorum, former senator from Pennsylvania and 2012 candidate for president, noted the trend and criticized conservatives for retreating on key social issues like gay marriage.""I have never been involved in a race, where you play defense on an issue and yet you put points on the board. And yet that's what we do,"" Santorum told the crowd. ""If you look at the current conservative movement, the Republican Party, there are issues we haven't even lost yet, and we're talking about giving up.""Asked later why marriage had scant mention at the event, Santorum demurred and plugged his book, Blue Collar Conservatives, where he writes about ""reclaiming"" the institution.""Believe or not, I don’t go talking about that everywhere I go. Believe it or not, I don’t,"" Santorum told a reporter.Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, the host of the event, argued the issue was as important to social conservatives as ever, in light of the steady march of the marriage equality movement.""Oh there are some here that have said it. They may not have said it here today, but they have been on record,"" Perkins told The Huffington Post of the Republicans who spoke at the gathering. ""I think the redefinition of marriage and the loss of religious freedom will continue to be an issue.""I don’t see among the core conservative Republican leaders anything backing away from natural marriage,"" Perkins added.Values Voter Summit continues with more speakers on Saturday, where the National Organization for Marriage will host a panel on ""The Future of Marriage: To the Supreme Court and Beyond.""

1,POLITICS,Eric Holder Was Our Firewall Against GOP Bigotry,"Earl Ofari Hutchinson, ContributorAuthor and political analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-holder-bigotry_b_5887984.html,The proof of Holder's effectiveness was the backhand perverse compliment the Holder baiters paid him in their euphoria over his resignation.,2014-09-26,"WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 04: U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announces a Justice Department 'patterns and practice' investigation of the Ferguson, Missouri, police department during a news conference at the department's headquarters September 4, 2014 in Washington, DC. Holder announced a federal civil rights investigation of the Furguson, Missouri, police department after white officer Darren Wilson from shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michale Brown last month. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d7502100002501c965bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most poignant moments in Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.'s six-year tenure heading the Justice Department came in February 2009 barely a month after he had been confirmed as Attorney General. He told an overflow crowd celebrating Black History Month at the Justice Department that America was ""cowardly"" when it came to facing race and racism. That did it. From that moment on the lines were sharply and brutally drawn. The pack of right wing bloggers, web sites, and of course, the GOP, made Holder their Public Enemy Number 1. They would hector, hound, harass, demean, insult, and batter him at every turn. He was hauled before countless GOP controlled House committees and grilled mercilessly on everything from his alleged bungling and deceit in the fast and furious gun running sting to the reporter leak flap in which he supposedly vindictively went after reporters in an effort to uncover damaging security leaks. The topper was the House's frivolous lawsuit, a contempt citation and an equally frivolous and clumsy threat to impeach him.The vicious baiting was never really about Holder. It was about President Obama and race. Obama, in the sense, that Holder became the softest of soft target in the GOP's no-holds-barred campaign to hamstring Obama with the odor of scandal and in effect straightjacket his presidency. The race part was even more insidious. Holder meant what he said that the nation had marched backward for every step it went forward in dealing with racial bias. He backed up his words with repeated actions on voting rights abuses, grotesque racially skewed sentencing disparities, and defense of gay rights. This was crowned by his rush to St. Louis following the slaying of Michael Brown and putting dozens of FBI and Justice Department attorney's boots on the ground there with the strong hint that a civil rights prosecution could be in the offing if there was no state prosecution of Ferguson cop Darren Wilson for the killing of Brown. This sent the professional Holder baiters into a tizzy and again the shouts were long and loud for his head.But Holder each time held fast and didn't buckle. He even doubled down again on his blast at racism noting on several occasions that he, as Michael Brown and countless other young black males, had been profiled by police once as a law student and later as a federal prosecutor. To add even more to the GOP and Holder baiters' vitriol, he had the audacity to make the claim and the revelation of his personal experience with racial profiling in a keynote speech before Al Sharpton's National Action Network convention last April.Sharpton went further in that speech and frontally called out the GOP about its ruthless, cynical and politically calculating war against Obama. He noted that Obama had been vilified as no other president in living memory, and race was the reason. Holder could say that. Obama couldn't at the risk of creating another firestorm and laying himself open even wider to the accusation that he was a race baiting president. Holder in essence had license to say what Obama didn't dare say but well knew to be true. So Holder continually and effectively provided a protective cover over Obama in taking on the critics on racial matters. And he provided the same protective cover over the key areas of civil rights and voting rights protections that no other Attorney General had provided since Attorney General Ramsey Clark had done during the Lyndon Johnson administration in the late 1960s.The proof of Holder's effectiveness was the backhand perverse compliment the Holder baiters paid him in their euphoria over his resignation. They dredged up all the old distortions, myths, and lies about him in their rush to maliciously tar him as ""the worst attorney general"" the nation ever had. This spoke volumes how Holder was able to get under their skin to the point where they had to shout in glee at his departure. The beauty is that Holder has left a solid legacy of accomplishment in the areas that have been and continue to be the greatest flashpoints of public controversy, namely civil rights, and racial justice and fairness. A final testament to Holder's commitment here was his announcement three weeks before he announced his departure that the probe he ordered into the killing of Trayvon Martin was still active and that there were new developments to be announced. The implication was that there was still the possibility of civil rights charges being filed against Martin's killer, George Zimmerman. Holder then ended his tenure as he began still taking controversial stances on issues that would surely send his army of detractors back into froth. But that was vintage Holder. He was our firewall against GOP bigotry and we'll sorely miss him.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst. He is an associate editor of New America Media.

When the ""Modern Family"" star sat down for an interview with actress Aisha Tyler for her podcast, ""Girl On Guy,"" Tyler asked Ferguson how his parents responded to his being gay and asked if he had a formal coming-out. ""Well, I was caught stealing gay porn when I was 14,"" Ferguson, who was raised in New Mexico, admitted. ""So, I always considered that my coming-out. ... It was so humiliating. I had been stealing porn for a while. I had quite a little collection. And I would bring it into the house, and then I'd get nervous, so I'd hide it under the mattress, or I'd hide it behind a shed in the backyard. And then it would get rained on, and I'd have to go get the barbecue tongs to [get it out]."" One day while stealing X-rated material, Ferguson picked up one that happened to have a sensor on it and was caught. ""I had to go back, and the woman asked me if I had anything in my backpack. She was giving me the benefit of the doubt. ... She took me to the back room. They brought my dad in, and they showed him the nature of the material I was stealing, and it was really, really humiliating. So I always consider that my coming-out process."" Despite the gay porn incident, the actor says his father ""wanted to hear me say [I'm gay]."" ""When I stole the porn it was like, 'OK, are you gay?' And I was, like, 14. I didn't really know. I didn't know what I was going through. But then in my later teen years I did come out to him, and it was like he needed to be told three times. ... [When I was 21] he asked me if I had a girlfriend at the time, and I was like, 'Dad! You know I'm gay, right?'"" He said his father ultimately had an ""evolution"" about his son's sexuality and gave a moving speech the night before his wedding to Justin Mikita last year, accepting him into the family. ""It was a process for him as well. It was sort of a coming-out process, and he had to figure out how to deal with having a son that wasn't the ideal son that he had,"" he told Oprah Winfrey last year. h/t Gay Star News"

Activists mobilized in cities across the globe Sunday for marches against climate change, with one of the biggest planned for New York, where celebrities, political leaders and tens of thousands of people were expected. The march comes before the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon convenes a climate change summit of 120 world leaders . AFP PHOTO/Timothy A. Clary (Photo credit should read TIMOTHY A.

I was in New York, along with hundreds of thousands of other people -- the biggest march against climate change in the world so far -- trying to bring the energy of morality, values, faith, and especially, a commitment to children and grandchildren. The march was marked by its diversity of people and groups and its passion, with many hopeful images of a different future beyond our fossil fuels past and present. Leaders from many faiths, religions, and wisdom traditions made it clear that climate change presents a spiritual crisis, not just an economic and political debate. Our conversations included dialogue with UN leaders on how to reverse the dangerous direction the world is still taking. Together we shared signs of progress and increasing alarm over inaction. We wrestled with how faith communities might provide vision and hope to sustain the social movement we need to reverse our present course. We agreed that the historically necessary transformation from our fossil fuel economy to a renewable clean energy world will require the power of faith. For many people of faith and others, the march culminated in Religions for the Earth, a multifaith service at the historic Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Here are some of the remarks I prepared to share with the packed house of prayer: ""We all know that the world is moving down a very dangerous path, and that we must reverse our direction. But so far, the credible and persuasive scientific case hasn't accomplished that. Sensible economic proposals haven't halted that direction either. And smart political arguments have yet to reverse our course either. For people of faith, this list includes care for all marginalized peoples, those ""least of these"" to whom Jesus called us to show special care in the Gospel of Matthew. As I told those gathered at the multi-faith service, climate change is devastating my list of concerns as a follower of Jesus, and that converts me again. All who Jesus named as the least of these will be devastated further by climate change. For the hungry -- massive food shortages and starvation. The thirsty -- more droughts. The naked -- stripping millions of all their resources. The stranger -- dislocating millions more as immigrants. The sick -- spreading more disease. The prisoner -- more destabilization, chaos, desperation, and crime.All are being harmed by our inaction on climate change: ""Jesus also instructs us to be peacemakers, who take on the causes of terrorism and war -- not only 'peace lovers,' who just hope their government comes up with an effective military strategy. Let's tell the truth: we won't see the end of threats like ISIS until we repent of our addiction to the fossil fuel economy with its legion of injustices and its sins against God's earth and God's children through climate change.Al Gore, one of the other Cathedral speakers, quoted Wallace Stevens in reminding us, ""After the final no comes a yes."" We must believe that each ""No"" to addressing and reversing climate change will one day be turned into a ""Yes"" -- but only if our faith and hope keeps saying and living: Yes. ​_____________ Jim Wallis is president of Sojourners.

Yet every time I mentioned it to German friends in Berlin, I was met with eye rolls and groans. Was this merely northern snobbery toward Bavarian tradition? Could the world's largest beer festival really be as culturally devoid and overcrowded as they suggested?I visited Munich on opening weekend to find out.As an American, I had been warned repeatedly by skeptical Germans that Oktoberfest beer is stronger and the servings larger than I was prepared to handle.""It's not Miller Lite,"" they nagged.For example, Löwenbräu brews its beer specially for Oktoberfest with 6.1% alcohol by volume, a stronger version of its usual ware. True to American form, I brashly replied that this pales in comparison to many of our craft beers.Yet it is not necessarily the alcohol content that puts some revelers on the floor by noon; cheering crowds, the unpalatable cost of food, and pressure from the ""Ein Prosit"" song make the liters disappear more quickly than they might under normal circumstances. Last year some 6.4 million visitors consumed 6.7 million liters of beer.I expected the tents to consist of white canopies covering benches in green fields. After all, the local name for Oktoberfest, ""Wiesn,"" means meadow. Instead, the tents turned out to be full-blown halls -- German engineering doesn't mess around -- and the grounds were a concrete jungle of carnival rides. As the evening wore on, these attractions become exponentially more fun, less frightening, and more likely to induce violent illness.In U.S. beer gardens, a liter of beer is popularly called a stein. This is one of a few German words Americans believe they know. Although it may have roots in history -- ""stein"" translates to ""stone,"" which was used before glassware -- asking for a stein won't get you far at Oktoberfest. Rather, the default one-liter order is a Maß (pronounced ""mass"").For waitresses, it's an endurance test. They work on commission and tips, often serving food and beer in crowded tents for fifteen hours a day. If you get bruises on your hand from repeatedly lifting a 4.5-pound glass of beer, imagine delivering twelve at a time across a hall of drunk people.About one million people visited the festival last weekend, according to Oktoberfest organizers. Despite its name, the majority of this year's event takes place at the end of September, closing on October 5th.This weekend the Italians will descend on the festival, complete with their own supplementary police force. If you prefer ""Salute"" to ""Prost,"" now would be a good time to visit.Clare Richardson is based in Berlin on an Arthur F. Burns Fellowship."

A projection was made from NFL documents in the concussion lawsuit as to what the future holds for current players. The prediction stated that three out of ten former players would have brain damage as a consequence of playing in the NFL. This news was greeted with a great collective yawn. Which is collective denial.Three out of ten players suffering brain damage from concussion is arguably way too low. Some neurologists theorize that every time an offensive lineman hits a defensive lineman at the inception of every play it produces a low level sub-concussive event. It is then possible that a lineman who plays high school, college, and professional football could suffer ten thousand sub-concussive hits. He would be aware of none of these, none of them would be diagnosed, because none would produce a knockout. The aggregate of the cumulative damage would almost certainly produce the symptoms of ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and depression that follow multiple concussions.I love football. I have made a great living from representing professional football players. I do not want to see it go away. But if 50 percent of the mothers in this country become aware of these dangers and tell their teenage sons that they can play any sport-but not tackle football, what will happen? It will change the socioeconomics of football. The young men who will play it are the same men who box, knowing the risk, but need to take it to escape economic poverty.It is not just football. Young girls need to be aware of the risks inherent in collisions and heading the ball in AYSO soccer. Concussions occur in all collision sports. The younger brain is at risk for longer recovery and heightened danger. Weren't Dave Duerson and Junior Seau's demise dramatic enough to make solving this a national priority?1)We need discussion about what sports are appropriate for very young children to play.  2) Safe blocking and tackling techniques for football need to be taught from the beginning.  3) Contact needs to be limited in high school football-Practice Like the Pros is a good program  4) Helmetry needs the best in engineering to truly protect. Tate Technology has a promising coil-compression system that dissipates the energy force and reduces it dramatically.  5) Better diagnostic techniques on sidelines so sub-concussive sufferers are not returned to play.  6) Nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals that a) Make the brain less susceptible to being concussed, b) Reduce swelling at time of hit-Prevacus has promising nasal spray that does just that c) Heal the brain. Stem cell is still a few years off.We are talking about an injury of a totally different dimension from other sports injuries. The brain determines personality, memory, judgment -- what it means to be a sentient human being. We treasure and venerate valiant athletes. It is time to make caring for their health and welfare after the cheering stops a top priority."

The CBC's annual conference brings together activists, politicians and business leaders to discuss public policy impacting Black communities in America and abroad. (Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13de22400005400e4792c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama has chosen, once again, an ""in-between"" approach to keep all of his options open, no matter how contradictory they are. The anti-ISIS coalition operations began with the U.S. imposing its priorities on the members of the alliance, insisting that their concerns must wait because America has its own priorities, including the elimination of the Islamic State and the continued attempts for rapprochement and appeasement with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Arab countries that have taken part in the strikes against ISIS in Syria this week underscored Barack Obama's insistence on his priorities. They participated operationally in the raids in the hopes that the partnership would practically prompt the U.S. president to contain Iranian regional ambitions in Syria and Iraq -- the main theater of the war on ISIS -- to challenge them directly and earnestly. Will those hopes be shattered? The answer to this question remains ambiguous, given the conflicting information -- if not conflicting U.S. policies in the nuclear negotiations with Iran. There are clear hints that the five Arab countries that took part in the airstrikes in Syria had been coerced because they are countries that are linked to the U.S. by bilateral security ties that supersede their priorities in Iraq and Syria equally. Yet there are gains that the five countries -- Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Jordan, and Bahrain -- have made through their involvement in the operations in Syria.First, they proved their merit in assuming the responsibilities assigned to them in the coalition against ISIS, no matter where it is, regardless of differing views with the U.S. leadership over this alliance. Secondly, they precluded the kind of partnership that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had sought to forge with the U.S. in counterterrorism as a way to rehabilitate himself and replace the key Arab countries in the alliance against ISIS, wherever it may be. Thirdly, the U.S. entered -- finally -- as a direct party in Syria, after a long period of repudiation, hesitation and pussyfooting that have accompanied the positions of President Obama since the peaceful quest for reforms turned into a devastating conflict. Fourthly, the Obama administration, finally and after the death of 300,000 Syrians, showed its willingness to provide practical support to the moderate armed Syrian opposition by allowing its Arab allies to supply weapons, train fighters and provide aid. This is a qualitative shift that could alter the balance of power on the ground, in order to make it possible to resume work toward political solutions.Fifthly, they opened the door to the possibility of overcoming the Assad complex, along the lines of how the Nouri al-Maliki complex was resolved in Iraq: by forcing him to step down from his post as prime minister. Sixthly, more measures have been taken against foreign fighters in Syria, under a binding resolution of the U.N. Security Council, which includes Hezbollah fighters. What the Arab states taking part in this alliance are using as their ammunition is the fact that they are indispensable in this alliance and this war, which the U.S. president said will not end until the goal of destroying ISIS and its ilk is achieved -- no matter how long it takes. These countries are key partners in the war, and are the main influences on the fighters on the ground -- or the boots on the ground -- in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. president, meanwhile, wants a war that he vowed would have no American troops fighting in it. The cards that Saudi Arabia holds in particular are crucial, especially in Iraq, where Saudi can -- if it wants -- be the most important actor that influences the indispensable warriors in the war on ISIS and the like, namely, Sunni tribes in Iraq. Riyadh does not need Washington in this matter, as much as Washington needs Riyadh, which has the keys to those fighters on the ground. On the Syrian arena, the indispensable warriors are the Free Syrian Army and other forces that are classed as part of the moderate armed Syrian opposition. The Arab countries that can provide weapons, ammunition, cash, and take part in airstrikes, such as the UAE, are indispensable for the U.S. as well. In other words, the war that Obama declared from behind the rostrum at the U.N. General Assembly and the Security Council, cannot be fought without the Arab partners -- including Arab states and the Syrian opposition. Nevertheless, the key Arab partners in Obama's war were drawn into his priorities, and agreed to begin military operations without prior guarantees for their priorities, namely: containing the ambitions for Iranian hegemony in Syria and Iraq, and removing Bashar al-Assad after convincing his regime to agree to a transitional governing body that would include representatives from the regime and the opposition until elections are held.One of the reasons, perhaps, is their conviction that U.S. military operations in Syria would not stop with ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates when it becomes clear to President Obama that the actual result of these raids is shoring up the regime in Damascus and allowing it to defeat the moderate opposition, with the U.S. having shunned the terrorist opposition. This is an adventure that the Arab poles are engaging in in the course of their alliance against ISIS. As to the reason for this, the answer lies in their stakes as well. These Arab powers see in turn that ISIS is a direct threat to them in their home soil, and an existential threat to their states. So, actually, what will happen in Syria is the next step in the war of attrition, with direct U.S. participation and direct Arab assistance. For this reason, the Syrian conflict could drag on.The conflict in Syria could drag on and on, in the absence of political accords, especially between the U.S. and Iran, and Washington and Moscow. The attrition would affect the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is deeply involved in Syria, as well as Hezbollah, which continues to fight all spectra of the Syrian opposition in Syria. Most likely, Lebanon will pay a price for ISIS' retaliation against Obama's war on the group in Syria and for the ongoing Hezbollah involvement in the Syrian war.In his speech before the U.N. General Assembly, President Obama chose to mention Lebanon only in one sentence, and he completely ignored Yemen and mentioned Libya only in passing, while reducing the importance of the Palestinian-Israeli question. Instead, he lectured on the Sunni-Shiite conflict, devoting most of his speech to this topic. The U.S. president did not present a war strategy except though the standpoint of Arab responsibilities and Muslim duties. He did not address Iran's regional role beyond its borders in the heart of the Arab world, despite leaked reports that had indicated the U.S. was adamant about tackling the Iranian regional role in the course of nuclear negotiations, followed by other leaked reports that denied this. Obama did not declare a position regarding Bashar al-Assad as he had done before, from the same rostrum, stating that Assad had lost his legitimacy or that his days were numbered. Nor did Obama mention the Palestinian state, which he mentioned when he first addressed the U.N. General Assembly, denying the centrality of the Palestinian cause and only saying that the situation in the West Bank and Gaza at present is not sustainable. Barack Obama called on the leadership and the popular bases in the Arab region to radically change their concepts, attitudes, and behavior, but he forgot or ignored that their differences with him are primarily ""personally political.""This president has finally decided to engage in the Middle East after ISIS lured him into this involvement. He accepted ISIS' invitation and bypassed the demands and political censure from the popular base, deciding instead to dictate his terms to the leaders. At the very least, Barack Obama did not seize the opportunity to rework his personal and historical legacy in his speech before the world. He declared an incomplete war on terror, just like he declared a futile war on Russia when he named it as one of three major challenges: the Ebola virus, Russia's role in Ukraine and the terrorism of ISIS and its sisters. This is not a conscious leadership. This is a classically reactive policy. If only the U.S. president would rise up to the level of challenges with a comprehensive strategy rather than tactics that keep him trapped in the ""in-between"" box.Meanwhile, regarding Arab participation in the airstrikes on ISIS in Syria, it is no simple matter that the UAE has tasked a woman to pilot an F-16 fighter jet and strike ISIS, which targets women in its barbaric wars through rape and various kinds of oppression and humiliation. There is a very important message behind this choice. Translated from Arabic by Karim Traboulsi RaghidaDergham.com"
9,POLITICS,Fewer And Fewer Unemployed Americans Get Benefits,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unemployment-benefits_n_5888518.html,,2014-09-26,"UNITED STATES - JULY 8: A strong storm front passes over the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, July 8, 2014. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d7531f00003d0225753a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Fewer jobless Americans now receive unemployment benefits than at any other point in the past few decades, according to a new analysis by the Economic Policy Institute.The liberal Washington think tank reports that as of August, just 25.9 percent of jobless workers were receiving unemployment insurance, the lowest rate since 1987. Unemployed workers are only eligible for benefits if they were laid off after an extended period of employment. The so-called recipiency rate has declined not because of the economy's improvement, but because of deliberate decisions by state and federal policymakers. ""With 2.1 job seekers for every job opening, Congress has essentially shredded the safety net while chances of finding work remain distressingly low,"" Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute said in a blog post. Layoff victims traditionally are eligible for six months of state benefits, and Congress usually extends that period with federal benefits when the economy tanks. After lawmakers lengthened the duration of benefits in response to the Great Recession, the recipiency rate peaked at 67 percent in 2010. But in 2012 Congress began shortening the duration of extra benefits, before dropping them altogether at the end of 2013. The rate of the jobless receiving unemployment insurance has also declined because Republican lawmakers in seven states have cut the duration of state-funded benefits from the typical 26 weeks that prevailed before the economy crashed in 2007. There were 9.6 million unemployed in August, including 3 million long-term jobless beyond the reach of state benefits. Fewer than 2.5 million receive unemployment insurance, according to the latest data from the Labor Department. The number of long-term jobless, defined as those out of work at least six months, is falling fast but remains higher than at any other time since 1948. This chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the number of long-term jobless Americans over time (the numbers on the y-axis are in thousands).

The weather is good, the tourists are gone (except for you, of course) and you can get into some of the best restaurants without waiting for days or even week.",2014-09-25,2014-09-23-Biking_in_Copenhagen_Photographer_Christian_Alsing.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-23-Biking_in_Copenhagen_Photographer_Christian_Alsing-thumb.jpg,"I saw Copenhagen by bicycle. It was easy, it was safe and it's the best way to get around the city.Copenhagen is going green, and an estimated half of the city's 570,000 people now get to where they want to go by bicycle. You can see the city by tour bus, van or some other organized way of exploring, and that's all well and good, but by bicycle, especially in a city that is so bicycle-friendly, you get to see it at ground level and still cover a lot of territory.Copenhagen in the autumn is an especially good idea. The weather is good, the tourists are gone (except for you, of course) and you can get into some of the best restaurants without waiting for days or even weeks (unless, of course, it's Noma, recently voted the best restaurant in the world). Photo courtesy of VisitDenmarkI met some friends at my hotel, the Imperial, near the central train station, and we struck out early one sunny morning for city hall (Radhus), where there's a statue of the writer Hans Christian Andersen, Denmark's favorite son. A gaggle of tourists were posing next to the statue, and in the plaza an impromptu game of soccer was taking place.We then biked a short distance to the Latin Quarter where part of the old university is located (the campus is scattered among four different locations). The streets are narrow, some cobblestoned, and it's often a tight squeeze between cars and bicycles, but bicycles, as always, are given deference. The streets are full of book stores and cafés.From there is was over a bridge (Copenhagen is crisscrossed by canals) to the parliament building, or Folketinget, where, as an unabashed fan of the Danish television series ""Borgen,"" I was able to see where the first fictional female prime minister of Denmark (there is now a real one) ascended the steps of the building to make history, at least in the television version. I also sat on a bench in an adjacent garden where Sidse Babett Knudsen, the terrific actress who plays the fictional prime minister, sat and made deals with her male colleagues.As we walked out of the garden, we spotted two real-life politicians, one who was leader of a minority party and the other the former leader of another party. My friends excitedly pointed them out -- they were walking along the street just like ordinary citizens, no visible security, no big entourage.Then it was on to the Kronborg restaurant for lunch. Now, I had never been a fan of herring before, but when I tried the ""smorrebrod,"" the traditional Danish lunch of open-faced sandwiches, I became a fan. It was delicious. There was a very old and very elegant woman sitting next to us -- she looked like she had just come back from church she was so dressed up -- and I imagined that she did this every day, had lunch at this lovely little restaurant as part of her daily routine. There is a sense of civility about daily life in Copenhagen, and this woman seemed to symbolize it in my imagination.I spent the rest of the day just wandering around the city with no special stop in mind. I had coffee at a local ""caffe"" bar and I sat in the window and watched the bicycle and foot traffic go by. Men, women and children pedaled by, some with backpacks slung over their shoulders, others with large containers attached to the front or back of their bicycles carrying who knows what.Although the city is compact, you may want to take a taxi to some of the more outlying parts of Copenhagen. There are also boat cruises around the harbor. I did see The Little Mermaid -- who wouldn't if you are visiting Copenhagen! The tour buses were lined up on the road adjacent to the harbor, and people were actually standing on the slippery rocks to get ""selfies"" of themselves in front of the little 4-foot-tall bronze statue.Back downtown, I biked over to Tivoli, the famous amusement park and garden first opened in 1843 -- it claims to be the second oldest amusement park in the world. That day there was a tuxedoed men's chorus on the main stage singing ""When The Saints Go Marching In"" while on an enclosed lawn two male peacocks, their plumage on full display, strutted their stuff in front of a female to the delight of the gathered crowd.I was persuaded by my friends that a trip to North Sealand (north of Copenhagen), was well worth the time, and it was. I took a commuter train -- the transportation system in Denmark is efficient, clean and direct -- about 45 minutes to Helsingor, also known as ""Elsinore"" in Shakespeare's ""Hamlet."" There, Hamlet's Kronborg Castle sits on a promontory overlooking a narrow strait of water. On the other side is Sweden (Denmark and Sweden were once the same country). I took a walk through some of the rooms (costumed actors were reciting lines from the play to tourists) and then walked about 100 yards to the west to the new Maritime Museum, a remarkable structure that looks like the hull of a ship sunk into an old dry dock. In fact, the museum has been constructed in an old dry dock, and it's collection of Danish maritime lore is fascinating and beautifully displayed.On the way back to Copenhagen -- I made this into a two-day trip -- I stopped off at the Louisiana, the famous museum of modern art about 25 miles north of the city. It's too much to see on a quick trip, but suffice it to say that the collections (Giacometti, Henry Moore, Picasso, Warhol, etc.) are rivaled only by the location overlooking the sea. That, I told myself, I would save for the next trip.On my last night I stayed at the Radisson Blu Royal hotel, which was designed in the 1950s by Danish architect Arne Jacobsen. Jacobsen also designed the interior, right down to the stainless steel cutlery and the signature Swan and ""egg"" chairs. Only one room -- number 606 -- remains as it was in the 1950s and 1960s, with green walls and wood panels. Jacobsen actually lived in it for a while. Before my flight home the next day, I took a final twirl around the city, just for old time's sake. I was not alone as I melted into the busy flow of bicycle traffic in one of the most forward-looking cities in the world. Even after a few days, I felt right at home."

""So shortly after this picture I Only remember kanye playing his new album 3 times in a dark room of 20 people last night and moshing drunk with mad babes,"" London wrote with an Instagram picture of the duo. London then tweeted out that he is on West's new album, including the first single, and that new album has ""changed a million times"" since West previously showed off some new music in London in July.We can only hope this means we'll get the first single and an album release date very soon (looking at you, Def Jam) so that Yeezy season can begin again."

It seems like whenever I express or defend myself, society perceives me as intimidating or angry. Thanks to a recent New York Times article, I learned what makes a black woman appear angry. All this time I thought I was just being a regular person with regular emotions. Turns out, black women are to be extra cautious of our actions and behavior.Check out the six easy ways to avoid becoming an angry black woman.6. Always smile. That's right ladies. Take the advice from that creepy old guy who undresses you with his eyes as you walk down the street. ""Smile baby!"" You must never forget that the shade of your skin identifies you as an aggressor. You must assure the environment around you that you come in peace. Smile no matter what! It doesn't matter what kind of day you are having, you must appease the world.5. Shut up!  The problem with us angry black women is that we never know when to shut up. We always have to voice our opinion or speak our minds. Why not speak in a more quiet or timid voice? Being out-spoken is the same as being a threat. Be nice and zip it girl! :-x4. Be passive. One surefire way to become a ""pleasant black woman"" instead of the awful ""angry"" one is to be submissive, especially at the work place. In most industries, black women are among the minority -- which means you are inferior, duh! Since you are one of the few, you must understand that you are probably under serious surveillance so try not to step on any toes! Some white co-workers won't appreciate you going for that big promotion and male colleagues may not feel comfortable with you in an authoritative position. You don't want to end up like ""a powerful, intimidating black woman,"" do you? Calm down! Stop being so aggressive.3. Have no reaction... to anything! So what if someone insulted you? So what if someone made a racially or sexually insensitive remark towards you? So what if your man cheated on you? They probably didn't ""even mean it that way,"" silly. No need to get all sensitive about it. Even if you feel offended, being defensive won't stop you from becoming that ABW, now will it?2. Always be aware that you are black. Don't ever get too comfortable in your own skin -- especially if you hold a prestigious title. Look at Olivia Pope, television's angriest black woman, running around Washington, D.C. with so much political and personal drama without ever noticing her own blackness. Remember your supposed place and accept that you are not classically worthy (or beautiful) enough to just simply be a regular human being. Keep yourself in check, girl!1. Them first, you last. This is the most important and effective way to avoid Angry Black Woman-ness. The ridiculous idea of respecting yourself first before considering the expectation of others will be your greatest downfall. New York Times journalist Alessandra Stanley knows black women best. Even though no one else perceived powerful black female characters on television as angry, Stanley discovered the issue and brought it to our attention. Angry black women are people who are unapologetically secure, successful and confident despite the color of their skin. How rebellious! Wait, is the angry black woman really just a white man?This post first appeared on KazzleDazz.com."
