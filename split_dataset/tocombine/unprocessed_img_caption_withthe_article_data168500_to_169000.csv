0,DIVORCE,"Do's and Don'ts For Newly Separated Parents To Avoid Santa's ""Naughty List"" During The Holidays","Dan Clifford, Contributor
Partner in the Family Law Practice of Weber Gallagher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dos-and-donts-for-newly-s_us_5b9ca95ae4b03a1dcc80a5f9,"With the holiday season in full swing, parents going through the divorce process should be mindful of the one thing that likely tops their children's wish list: for their parents to ""just get along.""",2012-12-21,"Family with child by Christmas tree, dad holding star",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca95a2000003000fda9b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With the holiday season in full swing, parents going through the divorce process should be mindful of the one thing that likely tops their children's wish list: for their parents to ""just get along.""Often overlooked when parents first separate are the holiday celebrations that were once observed by the intact family. For children -- particularly young children -- these annual holiday traditions become familiar and expected, but will never quite be the same once the family is split in two.From a practical perspective, it is not possible for newly separated parents to maintain every tradition, but they can and should try to preserve some semblance of normalcy, particularly during their first holiday season apart.To ensure the holidays remain a joyful time for every member of the family, newly separated parents should consider these Top 10 Holiday Do's and Don'ts:Do - Let the children sleep overnight in their primary home -- also known as the marital residence -- the first night of any major holiday, at least for this first year.- Have a joint gift exchange where both parents are present. This tops the wish list of most children and, during a time of year when gifting makes finances tight, does not cost a cent -- but will likely be remembered forever.- Help children select gifts for the other parent and/or set of grandparents.  - Divide the children's holiday vacation time evenly among both parents in a way that is practical and makes sense for the children (note that this may not be precisely 50/50).- Slowly begin to develop new holiday traditions, but don't attempt to revolutionize everything the first year.  Don't - Argue over minor issues, especially things like pick-up and drop-off times that can be easily adjusted.  - Force children to take part in all new activities the first year as a separated family. Retaining some ""pre-divorce"" holiday traditions helps children maintain a sense of normalcy and comfort.  - Fight over holiday decorations that may have been handed down from the other parent's family for generations and have sentimental value.  - Pit children against the other parent and/or set of grandparents, whether in-person or through word-of-mouth.  - Make claims such as, ""Santa won't know where to find you"" if your children will not be staying with you on Christmas Eve. This will only serve to inspire worry and fear, two things that should be avoided at all costs during the holiday season.  In all things, remember that children and their happiness should come first during the holidays. If ever there was a time to remain amicable for the sake of your kids, this is it. Do your best to keep your name off of Santa's ""naughty"" list, and enjoy a memorable holiday season with friends and family members, even if your family structure is experiencing change."

3,DIVORCE,Unemployment And Divorce: Does Losing Your Job Lead To Divorce?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unemployment-and-divorce_us_5b9c9dd0e4b03a1dcc8051c8,"I was laid off for the second time in November 2005. I'd been laid off once before, so I knew what to do. I sent out resumes",2012-12-21,Divorce Is Too Expensive For The Poorest Americans,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2e632400003000949425.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"By Divorced Guys LLC for YourTango.comI was laid off for the second time in November 2005. I'd been laid off once before, so I knew what to do. I sent out resumes, networked, looked online for jobs and leveraged the resources at an outplacement firm. By March, I had a few strong prospects but no job offers.  I knew it was going to be a long haul and felt resigned to that. Experts said it took one month for every $10,000 in salary. My wife was getting concerned; being a stay-at-home mom, she didn't relate to the job search process. And because I was home, why wasn't I spending more time with her? Tension mounted. Stress culminated. Fear increased. Not for me, but for my wife.By June 2006, we had separated, and she filed for divorce. In July, I moved out. I found a job in August (with a nice pay increase), but the inertia of the divorce process and ill feelings towards one another was too great. In May 2007, our divorce was final.At first I thought my situation was uncommon. But as I met more divorced men through my company, I was surprised to learn just how common it was. Being laid off seemed to increase the chances of getting divorced.This suspicion was confirmed in a study led by Liana Sayer at Ohio State University examining marital satisfaction and employment status. The examination found that when men are not employed, it heightens the possibility of either the man or woman leaving the marriage. Why? We've found that among the men we work with at Divorced Guys, coupled with the results of the above study, there are three main reasons for the layoff-divorce correlation:1. Marital dissatisfaction amplifier. If marital dissatisfaction is great, the loss of a job is just another reason to end the relationship. The pesky habit that she has that was a minor annoyance is now blaring in your mind like a voice through a megaphone. The lack of effort he shows to help with housework is like a thousand fingernails scraping against a chalk board. Instead of creating way to stay together, thoughts turn towards dissatisfaction and an exit strategy.2. Heightened negative emotion. The uncertainty of sustained living conditions is like a flame accelerant, feeding negative emotions to new heights. Tension mounts as the duration of unemployment increases. Accusations regarding the job search effort increases.Stress builds as the saving account balance dwindles. How will the bills get paid next month? How will we put food on the table? Fear increases at the prospect of major life changes -- losing the house or filing for bankruptcy.3. Broken societal expectations. Further exacerbating the situation is societal norms. He's the bread winner; he's supposed to take care of the family. But being unemployed, the spouse's mind frame begins to create an emotional poker game.The couple starts to fight and jostle for control like two poker pros raising the bet. ""You're home so why aren't you spending more time with me?"" ""Oh yeah, well why aren't you trying to help out the household and find work? Then one of the two goes all in and says, ""I want a divorce""; the other can't fold or show too much weakness, so the response is, ""Fine, sounds like a great idea to me.""Let's face it, if two people really loved each other, nothing would come between them. The loss of a job is a relatively minor event. But as marital dissatisfaction increases, ways to create the end of a marriage increase. This leads to heightened negative emotions and broken societal expectations.As I reflect back on 2006, did my layoff cause my divorce? I don't think so. We were not happy. The layoff just accelerated the inevitable.More Stories On YourTango:Dating After Divorce? 3 Pitfalls To AvoidThe 3 Best Holiday Gifts My Ex Ever Gave Me8 Reasons Being Married Is Better  4 Questions To Ask Yourself Before Filing For Divorce The Best Relationship Advice On YourTangoClick through the slideshow below to read about recent research on the impact of financial issues on marriage:Keep in touch!

My grandmother would make me drink big glasses of the tart fruit juice to detox after sipping on way too much Coca-Cola. And thanks to her wisdom, my insides were refreshed and complexion was positively glowing -- one of the many beauty benefits of cranberries that I grew to learn and love. It turns out that cranberries are a rich source of antioxidants, vitamins C and B, fiber and essential fatty acids. During the cold-weather months, beauty products packed with this superfruit offer anti-inflammatory and aging protection against harsh environmental elements. And if you dye your locks, try sudsing up with shampoos containing cranberry seed oil, since it preserves color and prevents sun damage.Here, seven cranberry-rich beauty products that not only smell amazing, but do amazing things for your skin and hair.

I just don't want things that can be wrapped.",2012-12-21,"Mother with baby sitting by the window. Christmas decorations. On Christmas, waiting for a miracle. A woman with a child looking out the window.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca2682500003600362542.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I was a kid, I'd ask my dad what he wanted for Christmas and he'd always say, ""I don't need anything"" or ""The only thing I really want is time with my family."" It drove me crazy. I could not understand why he didn't want to spend Christmas day surrounded by a mountain of torn wrapping paper and piles of toys, games, clothes and electronics. Thirty years later, his response to my annual email asking for his Christmas list was, ""We really don't need anything"" and ""Spending time with y'all is the present we appreciate the most."" Which is sweet, but kind of maddening. I'm learning to live with it. If he won't tell us what he wants, we buy him a sweater. It seems though, that I have inherited more than my dad's cheekbones. Now that I'm a parent, there aren't many ""things"" I want. Most of what I need I can buy for myself and I get more pleasure out of giving gifts to my kids than I do in opening my own presents. I'm happy on Christmas morning wearing comfy pajamas, drinking hot cocoa and watching the boys rip through ribbons and bows. This does not mean my family is entirely off the hook. This year I asked for a casserole dish and some yoga pants. I'm only human, and I don't need more sweaters. But at the end of the day, my list for Santa is short. At least for things you can bring in a sack. The other day I was running errands with Little Dude and playing a counting game to pass the time as we drove from place to place. At one point, he paused before he gave me an answer and I asked him why. His forehead crinkled and he said, ""Mommy, I was worried I'd get the answer wrong."" He's not yet 5, and he's worried about getting an answer wrong in a game. Damn. I assured him there was nothing to be worried about and that you learn when you try, not when you get the answer right. We stopped counting and started singing. At the next red light I sent up a silent prayer that the gorgeous boy in the backseat will learn not to be afraid of making a mistake. In that moment, I realized I have a much longer list for Santa than I thought. I may not want presents under the tree and an overflowing stocking, but I want. I want a list of things a mile long. I just don't want things that can be wrapped. I want my kids to be brave enough to face the fears that might hold them back and move past them. If they are afraid, I want them to be afraid of the right things. There's nothing to fear from being wrong or failing -- that's where you can learn the hardest truths. I'm ok if they're scared of being cruel, judgmental, or inflexible. I want them to persevere. I want my kids to be happy. Giddy and blissfully happy. Not all the time, but often enough that they have memories to sustain them when things are sad and difficult and painful. I want them to learn to be alone but not lonely.When they have choices, as Dumbledore says, to do what is easy or what is right, I want them to do what is right. More importantly, I want them to know the difference. I want them to be foolish, silly, ridiculous and absurd. Being outlandish is fun, and you get great stories you can tell when you're too old to fly on a trapeze. It's worth dancing naked in your living room not realizing the neighbors can see you. Trust me.   I want them to be decent. It's an old-fashioned word, but it's the best one I know to describe people who are kind and loyal and honest and good. I want them to have passion in their lives. Whether for a person, an idea or a profession, I want them to know how it feels to be completely captivated and energized by something other than themselves. I want them to have babies. When they're older. Much older. Before they have babies, I want them to have pets. If you can't handle a cat or a dog, you have no business raising a child. I want them to choose loving partners and trustworthy friends. If they can pick people who like my husband and me too, that would be a bonus, but even Santa can't control everything. I want them to be healthy and if they decide to experiment with illegal substances, WHICH I CERTAINLY DO NOT CONDONE AND HOPE THEY NEVER DO, I have my fingers crossed that they do so safely and for a limited time. I want them to know we love them regardless of the mistakes they have made, are making right now or will make. They are loved beyond imagining in spite of, or maybe because of, their flaws. They should know, however, that they will still be grounded if those mistakes involve breaking the rules. I want them to struggle. I hope they live in a dingy little apartment somewhere, subsist on ramen noodles, decorate their living room with a threadbare couch they picked up at a yard sale, and throw parties where they serve cheap beer and chips. That way, when they're older, and able to move on to a better brand of beer, they'll appreciate what they have. I want both of us to know when to let them struggle and when to help out.   I want them to succeed, but to understand that success isn't about paychecks. I want them to celebrate with joy and traditions, whether the ones we pass on or new ones they adopt along the way. I hope they're surprised when we show up at the door on their birthdays with their favorite cake wearing silly hats. I hope their traditions bring them comfort and a sense of belonging. I want them to get their hearts broken, not only because it means they loved deeply, but because it will teach them to be gentle when it comes time for them to break someone else's. I want them to learn to fight fair. I want their homes to be filled with books -- piles and piles of books -- so that one day, when they find themselves stuck at home in the rain with nothing to do but read, they can pull one out of a nearby stack or shelf and get lost for an afternoon. I hope they remember that book forever. I want them to know that they are capable and deserving of good things. They don't need to be their own worst enemy. There are plenty of other people out there qualified for that position.I want them to believe other people are also capable and deserving of good things, including respect. I want them to have long and healthy lives and a peaceful end to their time on earth. I want them to forgive our mistakes and learn only the good lessons we are trying to teach, not the crappy ones we pass on when we screw up. I hope when Santa makes his tally at the end of every year, they're firmly in the nice column, but not entirely. They should be a little bit naughty, because sometimes being bad is important too. If all else fails, I want them to know that no matter how many holidays go by, they can always come home and spend them with us. Even if we've turned their bedrooms into a home gym and a library, we will always take them in. I would prefer, however, that they don't bring me a sweater."
6,WELLNESS,Be an Angel: In Tribute to Newtown,"Rabbi Daniel Cohen, Contributor

In a time of darkness, we can be the vehicle for light. Intuitively, every one of us wants to leave the world a better and brighter place. Those that died last week live in us and through us.",2012-12-21,"NEWTOWN, CT - DECEMBER 16: Twenty seven wooden stand in a yard down the street from the Sandy Hook School December 16, 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut. Twenty-six people were shot dead, including twenty children, after a gunman identified as Adam Lanza opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Lanza also reportedly had committed suicide at the scene. A 28th person, believed to be Nancy Lanza, found dead in a house in town, was also believed to have been shot by Adam Lanza. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca78f2100003000c53675.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that.  Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that."" (MLK, 1963)How do we respond to the tragedy in Newtown last week? The loss of lives remains unfathomable and filled with grief. Twenty children and six adults killed and families, communities and our nation awash in sadness. We cry and mourn. We offer comfort. We struggle to find a message. Do we need more legislation for gun control, more understanding for mental health illnesses, and better security at schools? I do not have the answers, and they are complex. Yet, we can respond in a meaningful way. We need not wait for a commission or others to provide a path forward. What can we do? We can turn darkness into light. The response to the tragedy is not around us but inside of us.I attended the funeral this week for Noah Pozner, of blessed memory. The deep pain was palpable, and immense loss of a bright future and infinite potential seared the gathering as the song ""Child of Mine"" by Carole King was played and closed the service. Yet, the family and rabbi offered words of comfort and hope. Noah's brother concluded his remarks with the words, ""We lost a brother ... but we gained a guardian angel."" In reflecting on these words, I can relate personally. My mother died suddenly from an aneurysm at the young age of 44, leaving a husband and six children. Over the years, I truly feel my mother's presence as a muse in my life and an angel watching over me. Yet her loss, as I know Noah's will, as well as the death of so many loved ones, must inspire us to become angels on earth. An angel is not only a heavenly being but an agent with a holy and sacred task. No place, time or encounter is random. In the thousands of moments each day, we are called to sanctify our lives and serve as the angel to embody and spread some light to the world. Whether it's walking down the street and offering a smile and a simple ""good morning,"" or anonymously donating groceries to a family, the opportunities to be angelic are infinite. Every encounter with another human being offers a window into eternity. We may alter a life more often than we expect, and we may never yet know our impact. In this spirit, Ann Curry launched 26 acts of kindness, and our synagogue, Agudath Sholom in Stamford, Conn. is embarking on Operation Light on Dec. 25 and serving the homeless in Stamford and joining IsraAid in Breezy Point to rebuild homes post-Hurricane Sandy. We are all angels. Recently, I learned the impact of a few words I posed to a congregant over seven years ago. This past summer, we celebrated the completion of the entire Talmud, the Jewish work of wisdom, over a 7.5-year cycle. You may have read about the stadium at Met Life. On the Saturday following the event, we heard testimonials from a few of our congregants, men and women, career people who completed the cycle. They shared their journeys. One of them turned to me in front of hundreds of people and remarked that when I met with him for the first time I asked him if he set aside time for daily study. The question bothered him, stirred within him and ultimately was one of the motivators for him to embark on a study cycle that transformed his life. One question. I had no idea of my impact. Imagine if we harnessed the opportunities every day to touch people's lives. We are angels on earth who touch and are touched. In a time of darkness, we can be the vehicle for light. Intuitively, every one of us wants to leave the world a better and brighter place. Those that died last week live in us and through us. If we live today with this mission and act on its message, we will truly be the angels who leave footprints on earth now and forever.For more by Rabbi Daniel Cohen, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

The six adults killed will be laid to rest. Elsewhere, children will be home for the holidays. Moms will get busy baking, wrapping and shopping. In addition to our usual responsibilities, we will occupy ourselves with the joys and distractions of the holiday season. And we will move on. Most human beings have a weird, yet totally normal way of coping with trauma -- especially when we are bystanders to things that happen on a national level. Psychologically, we tend to go through a three-part process. • First, we inundate ourselves with images -- many of us become obsessed with details, trying to understand how something so horrible could possibly happen. We try to figure out why. We are hungry for information, desperate for understanding. Yes, very normal. • Second, we become overwhelmed, saturated, exhausted. We resent Anderson Cooper and blame network news for the non-stop coverage. We declare that we are going to ""go off the grid"" only to come back hours or a day later to see if we missed anything. Again, very normal. • Finally, we distance ourselves. It's basic psychology. When horrible, terrible and unpredictable things happen, we feel emotionally overwhelmed. Then, we find ways to tell ourselves, ""this can't happen to us"" and then we start listing the reasons. In order to avoid painful thoughts and feelings, we start to figure out how trauma can't touch us (and if it's already touched us, why it can't possibly happen again). For example, we distance from sexual assault (""If it's real rape, the body has a way of shutting down."") even though the prevalence is so high. We do it with domestic violence (""Only poor women are abused"") even though we know the numbers. We distance ourselves from senseless violence (""I live in a totally safe neighborhood"") even though we see the crime reports from our cities and towns. Again, it's normal. In fact, in the short-term, distancing and avoiding painful thoughts and feelings is very functional. How else will we keep moving on with our lives? How else will we decorate that tree and wrap those gifts? How else can we get our children off to school without them seeing our tears?The only problem with avoidance is that it only works in the short-term. In the long-term, it fails miserably. We are now at the point that we have a mass shooting in the United States every two weeks. Barely enough time to inundate ourselves with images, become saturated and distance ourselves. There are cracks in our denial. And for every parent, every mother out there, there are 20 little cracks in that armor of denial -- 20 images that we are having trouble forgetting. We are having trouble distancing and personally, I think the time for distancing is over. Instead, I'm suggesting a different psychological path in the wake of Sandy Hook. • Turn off the television. Go off the grid. Sure, stop reading this article for now if you feel overwhelmed. • Mourn. Light a candle and shed some tears. Have dinner with other parents and ask each other miserably, ""How in the world can we raise children in this kind of world?"" Give each other comfort and hugs. Rejoice in the everyday routines of the holiday season.• Then, instead of distancing yourself emotionally, get active. Once we are calm and collected, we may become overwhelmed with the complexity of each of these tragedies. Is it lack of mental health care? Is it easy access to semi-automatic weapons? Is it violent video games that de-sensitize some kids who are already vulnerable? The truth is, if each parent decided to focus on one issue and chip away at it -- not just today, next week, or next year -- but in a sustained way, we could truly make the world better for our children. If you think the problem is access to mental health care, write letters, educate and be a voice in your community. If you think the issue is easy access to weapons meant to hunt humans, post a Facebook status once a day with petitions concerned moms can sign to get sensible gun laws on the books. If you think video games contribute, start a block club for kids after-school -- where they can cook and play board games instead of sitting home alone in front of the TV. The possibilities to make a change are endless and energizing.When we become overwhelmed with our feelings, we go into denial and we become paralyzed. But we also have the ability to become more powerful than we ever imagined. If every parent, every mother, tried to do something -- in a sustained, tireless way- - we can make this world better for our kids. We can create a safer, saner world.
