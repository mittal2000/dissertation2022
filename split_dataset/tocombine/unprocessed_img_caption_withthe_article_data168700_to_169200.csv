In her new book, ""Tales"" from the Tarmac, Claudia Helena Oxee, a longtime station manager and independent airline crew consultant, offers a glimpse into the strange and sometimes unbelievable happenings at the airport and beyond. This is the first of three excerpts for HuffPost.WHEN CHILDREN TRAVEL alone between the ages of seven and 14, they are considered UMs (unaccompanied minors). Since they are the airline's responsibility, the ground and in-flight crews follow strict guidelines in handling these young passengers. During check-in at the departure terminal, a family member or guardian must fill out mandatory forms that contain pertinent information for the child's safety and security. These signed forms, along with their travel documents, are put in a plastic pouch issued by the agent and placed around the child's neck. When all is done, the child is handed over in the arrivals terminal to a family member who must sign for his release. In general, it is an amiable, secure modus operandi and children usually consider it a fun experience.Upon one of the arrivals at JFK, where I was stationed at the time, an agent called my office to advise they had a 12-year-old UM, his luggage, and no parents to sign for him. I asked the agent to wait a half hour or so, assuming the parents encountered traffic since they were coming from Stanford, Connecticut. An hour later, still no parents. The agent brought him over to me, and in addition to my usual operational responsibilities, babysitting was added to the evening's to-do list. He was a little cutie, not at all stressed, and he took it in stride. After a few minutes of making small talk, I called the UM's home. An answering machine picked up. I left a message saying they needn't be frantic with worry because their son was secure in my office. The two of us kept looking at the door and we reassured one another that any minute the distraught parents would magically appear. An hour later, it was evident that this was not going to happen all that soon.Since I had to be ramp side for our outbound flight, I told the UM not to move out of the office until I returned and that he was welcomed to answer my phone and take messages. After the departure, I was certain that by the time I returned back from the tarmac, June and Ward Cleaver and the Beave would be merrily on their way back to Connecticut. Not so! He was doodling on a piece of paper at my desk and when I walked in, he anxiously looked up at me and asked if his parents had arrived. I checked with the staff again and as expected, they hadn't, which meant another long night of surprises at JFK.My fear was that the parents had gotten into a serious accident rendering them powerless to call. What other possible reasons were there? Only something tragic would have warranted such parental delinquency! Why hadn't any one called? With a heavy heart and mind, I started preparing to be the potential bearer of bad news for this lovable UM. It had been more than six hours with still no communication from the family. How much longer could I wait before implementing a course of action?Just before calling Ops in Germany and beginning the unpleasant process, one last attempt was made to reach his parents. To my surprise, his mother nonchalantly answered the phone. It was such a relief yet my patience was being tested when I asked if she received all the messages I had left on her voicemail re: her distressed son's arrival. I shall never forget her answer: ""Oh, was that today?"" She did not ask to speak to her anguished child and asked if I could check him into a local hotel. Since her son was standing next to me, it was really an effort to keep my composure while discreetly cursing her and the preposterous request. She begrudgingly relented and said, ""Well, I guess you leave us no choice but to drive all the way to the airport now.""At 12:45 a.m., dumb and dumber finally showed up. As we approached the mother, she barely embraced her son -- considering his ordeal and the fact that he was away from home for two months. Unfortunately, I had to be civil and could not display my contempt in front of this innocent child, so instead I gave him a big hug, thanked him for his wonderful company, gave him my home number and told him to call me any time for any reason should he have parental issues in the future! I had his mother sign the UM release and an Incident Report advising her that both will remain on file indefinitely.A few days later, I mailed a little package to him consisting of a small model of the aircraft type that he flew in, a tee shirt, key chain and pen, along with a ""thank you"" note for helping me and making that day a very special one."

Well, American Airlines seems to be experimenting with fare bundling (as have Air Canada, Southwest and Frontier previously).In brief, American's newest fare initiatives (and they are indeed ""fares,"" not ""fees"") which they call ""choice essential"" and ""choice plus,"" offer several packaged perks for a set price, and although the media has already piled on American for adding ""new fees,"" for some travelers they may actually be a bargain. For a $68 add-on, choice essential fares include no change fee on domestic flights, which normally costs $150 per change; one roundtrip checked bag (normally $50), and ""Group 1"" priority boarding, which some airlines also charge for (Southwest charges $20 round-trip, for example, to board ahead of other customers).For an $88 fare add-on, choice plus gives you all of the above plus a free same-day flight change (normally $75) plus a premium beverage (which costs $7 to $8 on American).These fare add-ons (and again, they are ""fares"" which will be taxed at the 7.5 percent federal air transportation excise rate, whereas ""fees"" are not taxed), are optional, obviously, but for some people they may make sense. The ""expectant grandmother"" who isn't exactly sure when the baby will arrive and who normally checks a bag might be happy to pay just $18 for a ""change fee insurance policy,"" rather than the onerous $150 fee (that fee is charged for each change, so presumably it would be $150 twice, or $300, if someone changes both the outbound and return flight, or changes the outbound trip twice). And priority boarding is thrown in. Business travelers frequently change their plans, too, so if there's a good chance that the meeting will go shorter or longer than originally planned, paying $20 extra for same-day change flexibility plus a cocktail might be considered a ""bargain.""There's no telling, of course, if American will keep these fares, or whether they will increase them later on. Also uncertain is whether American will end up losing money on change fees (in the first quarter of 2009, for example, customers paid American $116 million in change and cancellation penalties). It will also be interesting to see if other airlines follow suit."

The study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, shows an association between drinking more than four cups of coffee a day and a halved risk of dying from oral and pharyngeal cancers. However, it's important to note that researchers only found an association, and more work is needed to figure out what exactly might be at the root of the finding. ""Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world, and contains a variety of antioxidants, polyphenols, and other biologically active compounds that may help to protect against development or progression of cancers,"" study researcher Janet Hildebrand, MPH, said in a statement. ""Although it is less common in the United States, oral/pharyngeal cancer is among the 10 most common cancers in the world. Our finding strengthens the evidence of a possible protective effect of caffeinated coffee in the etiology and/or progression of cancers of the mouth and pharynx.""The study is based on 968,432 people who were part of the Cancer Prevention Study II, who were followed for 26 years. No one had cancer at the start of the study, but by the end of the study, 868 people had died from oral/pharyngeal cancers. Researchers found a link between drinking more caffeinated coffee and having less of a risk of dying from the cancer -- specifically, people who drank more than four cups a day had a 49 percent decreased death risk from this cause, compared with people who didn't drink coffee. And people didn't have to regularly drink four or more cups a day to experience the decrease, as they found the risk gradually shrunk with each cup. While a slight association was also found with decaffeinated coffee, it was not as strong as with the caffeinated coffee, the researchers noted. No association was found between tea drinking and oral cancer death risk. Similarly, a 2010 review of studies in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention showed a 39 percent lower risk of oral and throat cancer among people who drink four or more cups of coffee daily, WebMD reported. That review, conducted by University of Milan researchers, compared coffee-drinking rates between 5,139 people with head/neck cancer and 9,028 cancer-free people.

And if you are a vegetarian, you know what I mean when special request ordering vegetarian, especially vegan, off a casual or fine dining restaurant menu serving traditional Western Cuisine. Vegetarian menu offerings improve with ethnic restaurants (Asian and Indian), which are primarily served in a variety of stir-fry, Pot-au-feu or New England boiled dinner type one-pot dishes. In America, chefs move the side dish to a center plate entrée, embellish them, and charge as much if not more for the special menu item than for their menu listed meat entrées. Currently the vegetarian entrée is, in general, a vegetarian side dish created as an afterthought. And that is the challenge confronting culinary professionals serving Western cuisine. Do they have the culinary fortitude and knowledge to create a vegetarian entrée that would rise to the stature of conventional meat entrée?Vegetarianism is a cuisine focused on plant based or animal biproduct proteins. In Western cuisine protein is about center of the plate entrees. Entrees focus on creating an innovative protein with taste, eye appeal and perceived value. By perceived value is meant the vegetarian entrée is worth the price charged. In Montreal I was dining at a restaurant with friends and it was a prix fixe $50 for a 3-course dinner. I was served a quinoa pilaf with a few side vegetables and my friends had a wild duck entrée with a bigarade sauce. In food cost, the quinoa entrée cost about $1.50 and the duck entrée with sauce cost about $7.50. But we both paid the same. To meet consumer demands professional cooks would be well served to improve their vegetarian culinary skills to an acceptable industry standard by learning about vegetarian protein options starting with the ancient proteins like beans, Seitan, tofu, and tempeh. Integrating nuts, seeds and Kalamata olives, ingredients with perceived value, into the ancient proteins and forming them into a center of the plate entrées (i.e. cutlet, cake, or patty) with a complimentary sauce is a viable strategy. Beans are the under rated protein on menus. Bean steaks, bean pates with roasted nuts and bean moussaka are some menu ideas. Beans need not be the entire protein. They work well in combination with tofu and Seitan. They also work in sauces. One of my favorites is smoking tofu and infusing it with beans with regional flavors and forming them into loaves or cutlets. Twenty-first century vegan meat analogues such as vegan ground beef style or chicken style proteins are now available through foodservice distributors. These analogues function similar to meat and have the perceived value. They are expensive as a frozen product and about half the price as a dry product that offer more menu or recipe options.Think vegan. To proficiently cook vegan professionally is to master the art. It allows the chef to create the spartan version of vegetarian cuisine. From experience I would always have a vegan entrée on your menu to assure that you can cover all vegetarian requests. But using eggs with the highest Net Protein Utilization of proteins is acceptable since the 35 percent of American consumers who are part time vegetarians don't care of the entrée is vegan.The American Natural Foods, a non-profit, has been working on a certification program to teach culinary professionals core vegetarian skills. It is in the final stages a launching Certified Vegetarian Culinarian (CVC) program for professional cooks. It was addressed in previous blogs for Huffington Post and will be launched around March or April of 2013. You can learn more about the CVC at the nonprofit website www.americannaturalfoods.org and it is supported by World Association of Chefs Societies (WACS). They intend to launch the certification program into approximately 30 countries once they approve the curriculum. The CVC is focused on vegan center of the plate proteins and classical/modern American desserts. Vegetarians are people who used to dine on side dishes. Now they expect an entrées that are innovative, delicious and healthy. The American Chefs will have to improve their vegan entrée skills if they intent to satisfy the ever increasing vegetarian and healthy dining consumers request for vegetarian entrees. The ANF is focused on helping culinary professionals meet the vegetarian challenge.The following is a picture is a Tofu Entrée made with the ancient protein tofu. The version is Thanksgiving Day Tofu with Cranberry dressing, Seitan ala Normandy and Veloute sauce. You can find the recipe on the recipe page. www.americannaturalfoods.org. The tofu could be filled with a mushroom filling, smoked and served with a Sardaline Sauce for a German version of the entrée.The following is a vegetarian analogue entrée called Le Coq Au Vin (Chicken with Wine).

On Friday, a gunman allegedly killed his mother at their home and then opened fire inside the school, killing 26 people, including 20 children. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca4f52500003300362657.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is always difficult to talk about death. We feel even more uncomfortable and nervous talking with children about death since we want to protect their innocence and shield them from sadness. Despite feeling apprehensive when talking to children about this subject, we need to support children through difficult times in order to facilitate healing and growth.1. Let your children be your guide. If you don't know what they know or understand about the death, ask open-ended questions to see what they know and what questions they may have. Let your child's questions and responses guide you as to how much information to provide. Give children ample opportunity over time to ask questions.2. Let your children know you are there for them and ready to listen. Never try to ""fix it"" or justify the death.3. Be honest with your children. Give them clear and honest answers to their questions. Children want, need and deserve the truth and need to know they can trust you to tell them the truth. You may worry that you won't know what to say or have all the answers. It is okay to say, ""I don't know"" or ""I don't understand that either.""4. Listen to your children when they are not talking. Know that your children are listening to you when you are talking. Children will not always talk about their feelings directly, but you can learn a lot by paying attention to their play, what they are saying while playing and what they are drawing or writing. Children see, hear, feel and absorb what goes on around them. You may think your children are not listening, but they hear you when you are in conversation with others or on the phone. Children have built-in radar.5. Acknowledge your children's feelings. Let children know that any feelings they may be having are OK and normal. Help your child label their feelings (such as ""sad,"" ""angry,"" ""frustrated"" or ""overwhelmed"").6. Assure your child. Be sure to clarify any misconceptions or misinformation. Remind your child that people care about them and will help keep them safe.7. Model for your children. Show children how you appropriately express your emotions and take care of yourself during the grief process. It is OK to let your child see how you feel, but do not use your child as your support system. Rely on other adults or professionals for your emotional support.8. Look for changes in your child's behavior. Changes may be a sign that they are feeling upset or unsettled. Be aware of changes in eating, sleeping, playing or the ability to concentrate. If your child's usual behavior continues to be disrupted, contact a professional for support.9. There is comfort in keeping to normal routines and schedules. Stick to normal routines as much as possible. Continue with regular schedules of sleeping, eating, school, extracurricular activities and play time with friends. These routines give your child a sense of security.10. Not all children will understand death the same way. Young children often do not understand that death is permanent. Young children may ask the same questions again and again. This repetition helps them process and understand what has happened. Keep explanations short and simple and reassure them that they are cared for and safe. Young children will absorb and mimic your stress and feelings.School-Age Children are better able to understand what has happened and that death is permanent. They may have unrealistic reactions to death, may blame themselves for what has happened or worry that others will die. Provide honest facts and information about the death. Help them express themselves through art or writing and help them label their feelings such as ""sad,"" ""stress,"" or ""overwhelmed.""Adolescents may have the same understanding of death as adults have, though perhaps not the experience with death and grief. Give adolescents time and space to work out their feelings. Allow them their privacy, but don't let them withdraw too much. Involve them in decisions and conversations about the death. Let them know you are available if they need to talk. Help them figure out what they can do that is meaningful to them. They may want to channel them into a community project or some act of charity so they feel like they are taking a positive action.It is be helpful to invite children of all ages to write or draw their positive feelings and memories about the person who has died. Open-ended questions such as, ""What are some of your favorite memories with this person?"" or ""What is the thing you are most grateful to have shared with this person?"" are ways in which children can express themselves and build memories about the person who died."

The massacre of 26 children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary school elicited horror and soul-searching around the world even as it raised more basic questions about why the gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, would have been driven to such a crime and how he chose his victims. (AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca4f32100003300c5352b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A young patient told me she was having a difficult time celebrating a recent promotion when her closest colleague was let go that very same day. Even worse, a number of her good friends were still unemployed and had no place to live. ""So many of them are by-products of the recession,"" she said. ""I'm not sure how I escaped?"" She told me she was so grateful to have a job -- working overtime and weekends -- hoping to afford her own place. Now with a raise, the move was possible. Instead she felt depressed and disinterested. We talked a little about survivor's guilt and began discussing how to move on.  Meanwhile, my thoughts turned to a much younger girl enduring a more dramatic survival in Newtown. I was thinking about the 6-year-old who reportedly walked out unharmed from the Sandy Hook classroom where all her fellow kindergartners were brutally killed. According to the local reverend who first saw her, she was covered in blood as she ran to her mom and said, ""I'm okay, but all my friends are dead."" And there are two adults who were injured during the shooting still recovering in the hospital. One can only imagine the emotional roller coaster they face as they heal both physically and psychologically.  I am the daughter of Holocaust survivors, so I have some familiarity with these complicated emotions -- one generation removed -- but palpable even now. To this day, my parents' experiences shape my psyche, how I think and feel about my everyday life. How do people work through survivor guilt?  For years, following my parents' arrival in America, they focused on putting their lives together. ""Put one foot in front of the other,"" they remember being told in the deportation camp where they met. My dad, a doctor in Poland, first learned to speak English, enough to get licensed to practice in America. My mother did factory work to help scrape by and set up my father's office while raising three children. The five of us lived in two rooms that served as both home and a place for my dad to see patients. Having lost everything and everyone -- and desperate to forget -- they were intent on building something from nothing and starting over.  On the surface, they seemed to thrive, so grateful to be alive. But internally, there was always a deep sense of sadness and guilt. They had escaped, but on some level they couldn't. Memories receded, but they were in constant mourning -- not only for their own families, but the 6 million Jews who were killed during the war. There was always ""before the war"" and ""after the war"" -- a delineation that defined their lives. While they spared us the details of their personal stories, my brother, sister and I knew they had witnessed the unspeakable and endured the unimaginable. We knew they wanted to leave it behind, but they needed our help to do that.  How did they cope? They struggled to make their lives -- and their children's -- meaningful. It was their modus operandi. They were going to prove one way or another that their survival had been worthwhile. My siblings and I did what we could to contribute -- to replace painful memories with hope for a better future. My sister brought home academic achievements. My brother, athletic ones. I became a professional ballet dancer to infuse beauty into their ugly pasts. We all went on to become psychotherapists, not only to help others, but to help them as well. If we could make other lives meaningful, we would carry on their mission.  But, while they were alive, their pleasures came mixed with pain. Joy was often followed by tears and sorrow. They just couldn't forget. There was an ongoing awareness of those who hadn't survived, who would never know joy, hope, the ups and downs of normal life. It was the burden they bared throughout their lives and one that we, in the next generation, felt as well.  Sadly, survivors of tragedies struggle in ways that most people find hard to understand. The emotions are complex and confusing. The feelings depend upon on the psychological makeup of the individual involved and vary depending on the nature of the traumatic event. Reactions to a natural disaster, an act of violence, mortal combat, bankruptcy or the loss of loved ones can be pretty different. But almost always there is the before and after, the desire to forget and a need to remember -- common experiences that follow throughout life.Guilt results from the perception that having survived is simply unfair and wrong, no matter how illogical these feelings may be. The experience may be unconscious but often times is quite overt. Symptoms can be severe, more like my parents' were, or mild like the ones my patient felt after her promotion. Without help, the guilt can fester, keeping survivors from letting go and moving on.The little girl who miraculously escaped the Sandy Hook carnage will hopefully return to a life of play and music and friends. The indelible images no doubt will live somewhere in her mind, even as she grows into an adult woman. She and all who were touched by this tragedy will find a way to internalize an experience that will have forever changed the way they view life. As the acute memories recede, with help and support hopefully the guilt will too. Do you have a challenging or traumatic experience that you survived?

As we read the details of that horrific scene, hear the stories of the survivors and see the unbearable pain of parents who have lost their young children, we cannot help but be overwhelmed with sorrow and disbelief.This shocking event has captured the attention of most of the world, and there is some small solace in knowing that millions of hearts are sharing in concern and compassion for the victims and their families. But each of us must confront, in the stillness of our own thoughts, the senselessness of such violence and the unjust loss of innocent young lives.  Whether this tragedy has impacted us directly or from a distance, we are left with the same questions: ""Why did this happen?"" and ""How can we live with this pain?"" There will be no answer for the first question -- some things are just beyond our understanding -- but we must, nevertheless, find a way to go on with life even if we have been shattered and disillusioned by what has occurred. Here are some simple steps to take to help cope with the devastation of loss and to ease the sense of helplessness that surrounds a time of tragedy:1. Give. No matter the circumstances, being generous is one act that can make a difference to everyone concerned during a difficult time. Whether you give money to the Red Cross or some other disaster relief organization, donate blood to a hospital, gather food and clothing for victims, contribute to a memorial fund, or offer your time as a volunteer, there are numerous ways you can give during a catastrophic event.2. Pray. Regardless of your religious beliefs or affiliation, there is always a need for thoughtful prayer and contemplation during a tragedy. Send loving energy to all the people who are suffering and ask that their burden of sorrow be lightened by your love. Attend a community prayer vigil or visit a local memorial site and offer your prayers and support together with many other concerned individuals.3. Light a candle. In the days following the 9/11 tragedy I found great comfort by lighting a seven-day sanctuary candle on my mantle near a window. I replaced it with a new one each week and kept the light burning continuously for over a month while our nation grieved that terrible loss. The presence of the candlelight reminded me that there is always a light within every time of darkness and prompted me to whisper a brief prayer each time I glimpsed the tiny flame.4. Look within. We can use these difficult experiences as a catalyst for our own growth by taking the time to look inside ourselves and analyze our own inner darkness. Journal about these questions: What must I heal in order to be healthier and live more fully? What sorrows do I carry? For what am I grateful? 5. Practice compassion. Whenever things go terribly wrong there are always plenty of people who look for someone or something to blame for what has happened. Even while the community is still reeling with the pain of the tragedy, some individuals will use the situation as an opportunity to spew out their hatred and anger toward others. But, resist the temptation to point a finger of blame and instead be the one who spreads loving concern and compassion in every direction. Counteract the negativity of those who are hateful by holding love in your thoughts and kindness in your heart, along with a willingness to forgive those who have caused harm. When disaster strikes, we are left with disturbing questions that cannot be answered and pain that can either destroy us over time or help us to grow stronger day by day. We have learned from past experience that we can eventually utilize the shards and ashes of tragedy to create something new. Now is the time to take steps toward our own healing and recovery in order to one day bring that same transformation to the world.

Pinto was one of the 20 students killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting.

I don't feel a sudden need to do that because a day never goes by that I do not want to hold my only child close.I learned fairly early in life just how fast death can come. So did my parents and my oldest brother. My middle brother, Kevin, was killed in a car accident at age 23; I was 21. I'm not trying to compare my family's loss to other families' losses. But after at first deciding not to write something about the Newtown, Conn., tragedy, I found I had to -- on behalf of the siblings who now will have to live the rest of their lives without a brother and a sister.A group called The Compassionate Friends likes to refer to grieving siblings as the ""forgotten mourners."" When parents lose a child, they are often so overcome that their surviving children's grief becomes secondary or even overlooked. No one can fathom the kind of grief the parents of those 20 children -- or the six adults killed in the same school shooting -- will experience in the weeks, months and years to come. No one, too, should try to second-guess how the tragedy will affect the victims' siblings.After my brother's death, well-meaning comforters thought they knew exactly what to say.""Be thankful you had another brother,"" one said.""The worst thing in the world is losing a child,"" said another.""Be strong for your parents,"" others said.I got the message. My grief should come in a distant second to my parents' suffering. In fact, my role wasn't really as a mourner. I was supposed to take care of my parents, a role I desperately wanted to assume. But I was still figuring out how to take care of myself.Some comforters inadvertently made it seem as if siblings were interchangeable. I was the youngest of three, and Kevin, two years older, was the closest to me in age and friendship. In fact, he was my best friend.I did try to be there for my parents after my brother's death, and they tried their hardest to be there for me. We struggled to figure out how to help each other. No one gave us a pamphlet for families dealing with the loss of a child, and even if there were one, it probably could not cover everything that can come up.My parents set up a scholarship in my brother's memory at his alma mater, Ohio University. It was a wonderful tribute. But it seemed like my parents' tribute because they told me about it after the creation. I would have loved to have been part of the planning. My parents met with a rabbi to plan the funeral, but didn't think to ask me along. We don't know to this day why that occurred. What we know now: It's important to include the surviving children in anything parents can.My parents would ask how I was doing, and I often sugar-coated how awful I felt because I did not want to make them hurt worse than they did. It took years before we felt comfortable sharing some of the wonderful memories of Kevin or could speak openly about how his death affected each of us.I was a young adult, though. The majority of the Sandy Hook victims were age 6 or 7, and many of their siblings, from what I've read, are also young children. They are living their grief in a public spotlight and may for years to come when reporters cover anniversaries of the school shootings. Still, like all bereaved siblings, the brothers and sisters of the Sandy Hook first-graders will probably have similar experiences.They, like I have, will celebrate birthdays and graduations without a beloved brother or sister present. One day, maybe they will marry and wish more than anything else that their sibling was there to witness it. One of the most joyous days of my life was when I gave birth to Simon in 2008. One of the saddest was barely a month later when it was March 1st, the 22nd anniversary of my brother's death. I went to temple with my husband and Simon to mark the yahrzeit, the anniversary of my brother's death on the Jewish calendar. I sobbed more than I had in years. Joyful to hold my baby boy in my arms, I was torn apart with the realization that my brother Kevin would never meet his nephew.Several news outlets published a eulogy read by an uncle at the funeral of 6-year-old Noah Pozner, one of the Newtown victims. Within in his immediate family, Noah was survived by his parents, two older sisters, an older brother and a twin sister, Arielle. One line in that eulogy shows that Noah's family already is thinking of everyone affected: ""He called Arielle his best friend, and she was -- and always had been.""As a parent, as a bereaved sister, I feel more than I could ever express in words for the mourners of the victims in the Newtown, Conn., shootings. My son Simon is now 4 ½ years old, barely two years younger than those first-graders. He starts kindergarten in the fall. He says, ""I love you"" to both my husband and me with ease. He loves to give hugs and receive them. He's silly, musical, and like any child his age, just curious about anything he sees or hears. He has heard nothing about what happened in Newtown and won't from us unless he brings it up. He has the right to live his early childhood in innocence and mostly joy. So did the 20 Newtown first-graders. So did their brothers and sisters."

Its greatest beauty is often when on the cusp of the changing season. I take solace in the quiet, find peace in the tranquility of the lake, and seek answers to my angst amidst the beauty of the trees. But my run this week found a deep greyness with each stride, heavy clouds and an approaching cold with little wind. A haunting stillness. Two of my favorite trees along the path stand together next to a bench -- leaves shaken off likely just days earlier. They are completely still, yet appear to have been violently shaken. I've studied these trees often on these runs and perhaps oddly, thought of my husband and me every time. One stands taller, masculine, with courageous purpose, the other, smaller but equally driven to stand tall and conquer. Usually, their beauty brings me a deep sense of unity, promise and hope. This week, my trees stood paralyzed. Like every soul in America and throughout the world, I've cried a lot since the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. We've cried, ""Why? Why? Whys?"" and ""How can this happen... again?"" For those children, those families and for us as a collective human race, we have all felt the sorrow, devastation and horror. Most parents I've spoken to or whose solemn Facebook posts I've read are still reeling in agony and confusion, clutching their children tighter in utter fear. How do we trudge onward with brave faces for their sake? When I stare at my sleeping children or drop them off at school, there's a heavier, greater angst present. It's not the fear of their safety alone. This gutted knot rumbles with larger questions too: When my tears dry up, as history shows they will, what will I do then? What will I do for the 26 lives lost? What will I do to help prevent this from happening in my child's school or another one in our city or another one anywhere at all? What will I do to protect my children and prepare them for a world that is certainly not just rainbows and unicorns?If I look at my own track record after tragic events in this country, I know the answer.Absolutely, horrifically, nothing.Time slips, and we morbidly move on. Do we forget? No. But something of great worth fades in the shadow of our every day. I know I'm not alone stuck in this depressing cycle. Still, we wonder if this time will be different. Can it? Can we grab our lives before they grab us?Crushingly, I haven't a grandiose plan of attack for this one. But I do know one thing: We are creatures of habit, human beings. As our holiday buzz wears off, we usually look to our traditional habit of New Year resolutions. Have more fun with family and friends... embrace fitness... get out of debt, etc. You know the ones. All are super-positive, healthy and should be life-long staples of our lives -- not the short-lived, broken promises we turn them into come mid-February. This year, I pledge to bump each and every one of them. Eventually, the weight will fall, the money will come, time with loved ones will be there. There's a much greater force that needs nurturing at this critical pass. I must love my neighbor as myself. Like, really love. Deeply. Kindly. Unabashedly. Yes, it seems like a natural thing we should just DO -- whether you beat the Bible or a bass drum. But we don't, most of us. It is in the days and weeks that follow tragedy that the majority of us look up from our hustle and bustle, look at strangers' faces and feel the bond of humanity. But come January, we're entrenched in our to-do lists, back in our bubbles, our self-important day to day, and our connection is gone. Our minutiae wins once again, and apathy becomes our greatest contagion.My favorite social share this week was courtesy of Mister Rogers: ""Look for the helpers"" in tragedy to find comfort and peace. These helpers are there now more than ever. But they are there, albeit in smaller numbers, ALWAYS. What can we learn from them? How can we savor and spread that passion infinitely? The greatest legacy for the Sandy Hook 27 should be how we honor them every day of our own remaining days. Remember the basic values we learned and cherished as children? I guarantee those 20 first graders had their own PhDs in goodwill toward men. It's something we teach the young, but bit by bit gets lost in the potholes of our paths. I kept hearing and seeing parents cry out ""we must do better for them."" Yes, gun legislation. Yes, there's a mental health crisis that needs immediate attention. But we also have an individual responsibility that starts the moment we wake up and walk out the door into our shared world. Just care for each other.There is so much power and greatness in this simplicity. Extend a hand. Be kind. It's what we ask of our children. We are their superheroes that must lead by example. Capitalize on the widespread care that is happening around us now and make it stick. The ways in which we can show our support for one another are limitless (Let's share our ideas in the comments...How will you make compassion contagious? Who inspires you to do as such?).I have deep faith that my lakefront trees will see another season. They will make it through the harsh Chicago winter, beaten, battered, but still standing. Spring will bring glorious change, and they'll look toward the horizon with hope again.""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.""--Dr. Seuss"

In two short days, I had fallen in love with the girls, who were touring with the Assante choir. As I cried into the phone because I couldn't imagine not ever seeing Divine and Arlene again, Adam Lanza was at the Newtown elementary school.As a mother, my heart broke open for the parents and families whose loved ones died in the shooting in Newtown. I cannot imagine the inconsolable grief the parents of the young children must be feeling as well as the families of the teachers, principal, school psychologist, the gunman and his mother. As a spiritual therapist, parenting educator and the founder of the Million Mamas Movement, an organization dedicated to the thriving of women and children throughout the world, I have been speaking to concerned parents and lead several prayer circles since Friday's shooting. There are so many victims in this tragic event. Adam Lanza killed his mother with a gun she had in her home. What prompts a child to kill a parent? The whole community grieves and, as bystanders, we grieve with them. All parents entrust their school-age children to the school they attend believing that they will be safe while away from home. I received many calls from parents experiencing mounting anxiety as this past Monday morning rolled around. To provide support, I spoke a centering prayer.While it is the human condition to point the finger at Adam Lanza for his violent spree and say it is because of lax gun controls, my mind has been entertaining other thoughts. The goals of the Million Mamas Movement include the teaching of peace principles and providing compassionate parenting programs to parents and educators. I feel moved to go to the root of what would cause a young man to shoot his mother and so many others. It occurs to me that we would find greater solace and solutions by integrating emotional/social intelligence into education and providing greater mental health options rather than displacing our grief and horror by focusing on gun control. This and other unfathomable acts of violence are a symptom of something deeper needing our care and attention.In this high tech, fast moving global society, it can be easy to lose sight of how important it is to connect the old fashioned way.Here are 7 tools I believe will help us heal as a society:1. Cultivate a practice of having quiet time with your family, whether it is meditation, being in nature, talking about uplifting and inspiring things or just sitting together listening to music.2. Turn OFF the news that has this and other horrible events on a loop. 3. Be conscious and selective about the media you watch and expose your children to, especially related to the content of video games, such as the popular Call of Duty. 4. Strive to eliminate violence of all kinds within our own hearts and minds -- emotional, physical, spiritual and mental.5. Build a loving and emotionally supportive society for all children and all parents and support all families in thriving by making compassionate parenting classes available to every parent in all schools and neighborhoods. (The Million Mamas Movement is committed to providing Compassionate Parenting Toolkits.)6. Train teachers in brain science, emotional intelligence and in the practice of empathy and compassionate communication as part of the curriculum in conjunction with academics and focus on nurturing children's social and emotional intelligence as the standard rather than focusing on standardized testing. 7. Make peace profitable by installing the Department of Peace in the U.S. Cabinet and making it of equal importance to the Department of Defense. Let's stand for a world where violence and retaliation is the not the answer in our homes or communities.The landscape of our world would change dramatically if we implemented even one of the suggestions on this list. When our children are honored for who they truly are and brought up to express their inner gifts, skills and talents authentically, they thrive and our society flourishes. What if we supported mamas and families with maternal well-being and subsequent parenting classes? The questions to ask ourselves are: Would we need gun control? Would there be shooting sprees and random acts of violence? In cases like Newtown, we will truly never know the why. However, these are the deeper inquiries we must all take if we are to have a culture of peace.Let us join in consciousness and know that loving arms hold the children, teachers, school psychologist, principal, gunman and his mother and that loving hands and hearts surround the grieving families, the community, and mamas, papas, and grandparents everywhere.Let's mobilize the mamas and grandmas and visionary men and transform the world."

Although tantalized by the prospect of a Delta-Virgin Atlantic partnership, many of us frequent and elite Delta flyers did not want to get too excited. After all, rumors of airline interests, talks, trial balloons, negotiations and other forms of corporate flirtation are somewhat common in the travel industry.Well, Delta actually followed through last week and de-Virginized Singapore Airlines of its share in the popular U.K.-based airline. The other 51% of Virgin Atlantic is still owned by eccentric -- or fantabulous, depending on whom you ask -- British billionaire and business mogul Sir Richard Branson. Branson's flair for the fabulous is reflected throughout all of his business brands, especially his worldwide collection of Virgin-branded airlines. From Virgin Atlantic to Virgin America to Virgin Australia, these subsidiaries' sexy style, chic design and edgy marketing campaigns are a far cry from the often bland, corporatist image portrayed by the likes of Delta, United, US Airways and American Airlines. But as economic times have tightened, as the competition has intensified and as travel consumer space has evolved (see ""America Needs a Five-Star Airline""), these more modern qualities that the Virgin Group airlines embrace have become increasingly attractive to increasingly savvy travelers. As a result, ""the Virgins"" have steadily gained attention, market share and legions of brand fans, even among those who are still themselves Virgin virgins. Now that Delta has succeeded in further penetrating the Virgin brand with this new joint venture with Virgin Atlantic (another Virgin brand, Virgin Australia, is already associated with Delta's SkyTeam alliance network), there is a lot of excitement among us frequent travelers and international travel enthusiasts that some of Virgin Atlantic's sexiness will rub off on its new partner and result in a more dapper Delta. Even if Delta retains its corporatist image and mediocre product quality, though, the prospect of being able to accrue, redeem and enjoy benefits on Virgin Atlantic makes Delta's frequent flyer program, SkyMiles, and its alliance network, SkyTeam, much more attractive for transatlantic fliers. I have thus far never had the opportunity to try out Virgin Atlantic personally, precisely because of its previous lack of an affiliation with my primary transatlantic carriers. But given the fact that I am currently averaging 10-12 transatlantic trips annually, I am eager to see speedy American and European regulatory approval of this new joint venture and see for myself if Branson's high-flying harem is really all it's cracked up to be. Fingers crossed that I'll get lucky."

Back then it had very little to do with the commitment and more to do with the party, the colorful details and, of course, the dress. As a child, I didn't question or truly comprehend what it meant to get married. It was just my understanding that that's just what everyone did when they grew up, so I'd better start planning early. It was, after all, the most important thing I'd probably ever do in my life, and in the naivety of youth, I was also under the delusion that it only happened once for everyone. You don't get a second chance at something so important and lavish.I can't remember exactly when it began, but somewhere along the line I started envisioning my wedding and logging it in a notebook. Looking back, had these weddings ever come to fruition, they would have been horrible for everyone privy to them. I hate to admit that once upon a time I wanted my wedding party in purple dresses. I, of course, would be in a white version of the dress that Molly Ringwald wore in ""Pretty in Pink."" (I know, I know... it's terrifying.)It was also during the purple dress phase of my dream wedding -- probably around age 10 or so -- that I wanted my wedding song to be ""The Rainbow Connection,"" by Kermit, the main course to be chicken cordon bleu and for it to be held in my parents' backyard. My father and I would dance to a Fleetwood Mac song of his choosing, my mother would bake the cake and my sister (obviously my maid of honor), since she had an aversion to the color purple, could wear whatever color she liked. As for the husband, his face was sort of a blur, although I do know I was probably hoping deep down it would be Donnie Wahlberg of New Kids on the Block. My dream wedding stayed that way, give or take a detail or two, until high school. It was around 17, when I was far closer to an appropriate marrying age that I decided I needed to revamp my future wedding. I tossed the idea of purple dresses for my bridal party in exchange for silver ones. I was going through a silver phase and had worn a silver dress to prom. In my mind, this color would look stunning on everyone -- everyone would also be rocking heeled Mary Jane shoes a la Courtney Love. It was the height of the grunge era. While chicken cordon bleu would remain on the menu for the main course, I had decided another option would be a good idea too, so, being a New Englander, I added the most obvious choice: lobster. I was no longer interested in getting married in my parents' back yard and thanks to having read too much Truman Capote, I decided that the only place for my wedding would be the Plaza in New York City -- a place I had never been to, in a city I'd yet to know and would eventually love. By then I had also attended a few weddings and, having realized that tables needed to be labeled, I would have all my tables named after characters from ""The Great Gatsby.""As for the song to which my husband and I would dance to? ""About A Girl,"" by Nirvana, of course. And my father and I, again after having been influenced heavily by film and books, would dance to ""Speak Softly, Love"" just as Don Corleone and Connie did in ""The Godfather."" Apparently, I thought that made perfect sense for our French/Irish/Swedish family. My dress, along with the husband, were both blurry at this point. I'm not sure why this was. Although I had a boyfriend at the time, I was quite certain I wasn't going to marry him. And despite my love for the grunge scene, I wasn't sure how I could work that into my wedding attire without looking overly disheveled. However, I did know I'd have my favorite flower, daises, in my hair. Yes, that's how my wedding would be and since I was 17 and practically a woman who would obviously be getting married within the next couple years, I assumed that this would stay permanent. Then I didn't think about my future wedding for a long time; a very long time. While some details would cross my mind, I stopped recording them or making notes. I'd occasionally rip out pictures of dresses from magazines, but that's where it ended. During and after college, I lost interest in the concept. And although, as I reached my late 20's and attended more and more weddings, the whole idea just seemed more of a hassle than anything else. Eloping started looking like the best option of all. In the last couple of years, I've swung back around. I no longer keep a notebook, but I do have a folder on my computer of wedding-related items that I'll occasionally add to if I see something great. These days I'm thinking a less over-the-top gown and something that's probably more blue than white. I'd still have daisies in my hair and lobster on the menu, and my dad and I would still dance to ""Speak Softly, Love,"" because, I mean, come on, that's funny. After living in New York City and having been to the Plaza so many times, I don't think I'd like to have my wedding there. I've reverted back to something low-key -- maybe even my parents' backyard after all. I'm not sure what song I'd like to dance to with my husband or even what colors I'd want to see my wedding party in, because honestly, I'd just rather they wear what they want. My future wedding no longer captivates me the way it once did and I know exactly why: love. At 10 and 17 and all the years in between, I didn't know what it meant to be in love. It was only after the first time I fell truly in love at 22 that I realized that all that wedding planning -- although fun in theory -- is just hoopla and showing off. I don't really see it having much to do with love; I see it as having a reason to be a princess for a day. Of course, every little girl wants to be princess for a day, but this woman, the one I've become, would rather the relationship part be right than the wedding details. Although I do think a wedding is a fine excuse to splurge on Jimmy Choo heels, because what else is a princess supposed to wear under a wedding dress?"
