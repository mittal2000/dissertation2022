I imagined she was leading me to her opinion of ""No way, that's disgusting!,"" which is how many people I know feel. But I paused, doing my best to open my mind and think about it before answering. ""Well, it depends. There are certain circumstances when I think it's OK. Like in some countries where it's the norm or if the child was in need of nutrition and it's the only way.""""I breastfed my friend's baby,"" Alice blurts out.If I were drinking coffee, this would be the perfect spit-take moment.

But upon further discussion, it wasn't that the child was starving at all or that her friend was caught under something heavy and couldn't get back to her malnourished infant. It was simple. Her friend (hey, let's call her ""Sandy""), had gone out to get a break from the baby and began to get fussy. Alice thought the child could use some comforting, so out came her new-mom lactating breast.I wasn't sure if it was the act of breastfeeding another's child or the idea that she never checked in with her friend before offering up her lady parts. I just had to know, how did Sandy react?""When I told her, she laughed.""Now, either I'm the most uptight mom out there or I'm missing out on some boob-sharing baby fun. Am I the only one who kept my bosom to my own babies? Am I just a judgmental prude? Alice shared that she never would have done it if she thought Sandy would be upset saying, ""It's just milk. There are some things I feel are worth fighting about. But it's just milk. Especially when you're a new mom and you're up all night. Sometimes, when someone else can pick up the burden to give you a few minutes of respite, it's just milk at that point. It's just milk.""I couldn't get Sandy on the phone fast enough. Was she secretly livid that Alice was so bold? Has it actually been something eating away at her, creating a huge distance in their long-term friendship?Nope.Sandy says, ""I really didn't think much of it because my 57-year-old mother had already used that technique [to soothe] and I didn't think anything of it then. That's what a nurse maid was for. I was surprised she did it just because I didn't know her comfort level but it didn't bother me -- a 57-year-old boob is much different, so hers was no big deal.""I have to know... where do you stand on breastfeeding another mom's baby?

While wild animals may be nervous of human beings on foot or in a vehicle, they are much more relaxed around horses because the horse disguises your smell. Traveling on horseback also allows you to explore beyond the reach of a vehicle and is a welcome change when you have been sitting in a car on game-drives six to eight hours a day for much of your trip. Ride Kenya offers multi-day trips in Amboseli/Chyulu Hills in Kenya There are many horseback safari options in East and Southern Africa, offering everything from lessons and one to two hour rides to 10-day horseback camping adventures in the bush. Here are some my favorites:Multi-Day Horseback Safaris You can find a multi-day itinerary for almost any level of skill and a wide range of budgets. You can camp every night or end each day at a luxury lodge. Find a sample itinerary here and scroll through the slide show to see multi-day horseback safari options from Kenya to Botswana to South Africa.Almost all of these multi-day itineraries will ask you to complete a self-assessment of your riding ability. Please be honest! You will be traveling in areas where there are wild animals and you need to be comfortable enough on a horse to handle the unexpected. If you come across a lion in the grass or a charging buffalo you need to be able to stay in the saddle if your horse reacts. It is no fun for anyone if you get scared or hurt and there are programs for all riding levels so you can find one that matches your skill level.Shorter Rides Properties that offer a day or afternoon of riding are great not only for beginners but for avid riders who want some riding on their holiday along with other activities, or who are traveling with others who do not want to ride. Here are just some of the properties that offer riding as an activity:Kenya Lewa Wilderness and Lewa House: Lewa Wilderness Lodge offers horses suitable for novice riders to ride for a couple of hours while staying at the lodge. Guests staying at Lewa House also have access to the horses. Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, Photo by Marcus WestbergOl Malo: Ride for an afternoon at this family-run lodge in Laikipia.

I've seen plenty of changes in name trends since that time, as an American girl is now more likely to be named Cherish or Skyla than Christine or Susan.One of the biggest developments, though, isn't about the names themselves but about the way we talk about them -- or rather, how much we talk about them. Name talk is everywhere. My peculiar obsession with names doesn't seem so peculiar any more.Do you find yourself discussing celebrity baby names more these days? Do you notice more articles about the top names of the year, or hear more friends agonizing over whether Amelia and Atticus have become ""too popular""? And do you find all the talk hard to resist? It's not your imagination, and it's not just you. Baby names are taking new prominence in our culture.Allow me to take you on a tour. First stop: the New York Times archives. The phrase ""baby names"" has appeared in 78 Times newspaper articles in the past three years. Looking twenty years earlier, that number was just 7. ""Baby naming"" shows similar growth, while other baby phrases like ""baby clothes"" and ""baby strollers"" have held steady.Next stop: Google's Ngram viewer, which allows historical searches of a massive collection of books. Check out the Ngram graph of the rate of occurrence of ""baby names"" and ""baby naming"" in English-language books in the 20th Century. A surge in both phrases started around 1980 and kept on growing. And their data only goes up to the year 2000. Anybody think that curve has gone anywhere but up since?If you're actually in the market for a baby name, the clamor is even louder. The number of baby-naming books has skyrocketed, and they're pushing ever-larger menus of options. (""100,000 BEST Names for Baby!"")It makes sense that names are a hotter topic than ever before. After all, they're more diverse and more meaningful than ever before. But isn't it nice to know, for sure, that you're in good company? Welcome to the obsession, everyone."

But if you're in a spending mood this month, here's where you will find some of the best deals.1. Wedding registry itemsAccording to wedding site TheKnot.com, on average, couples register nearly six months before their wedding. So, if you have a wedding to attend in the popular summer and fall months, plan ahead and save. Small appliances, cookware and linens go on sale in early spring to kick off wedding season, graduations and Mother's Day shopping.TheKnot.com says the top three stores where couples register are Bed Bath & Beyond, Target and Macy's. Start collecting coupons from these retailers and sign up for their email lists for additional savings. And ask about their price-adjustment policy. For most stores, if an item you buy goes down in price within 10 to 14 days of your purchase, they will credit you back the difference. So mark your calendars and check back. Just save your receipts.Team up. Wedding etiquette deems it's perfectly all right to go in on a group gift. Many couples expect it when they put big-ticket items on their registry.2. CruisesBelieve it or not, it's a good time to make your travel plans for 2014. If you're planning on taking a cruise during peak times like spring break or summer, book as early as possible. This will ensure availability at a good price.CruiseCritic.com recommends booking your cruise six to 12 months in advance if you'd like to travel during prime times. River cruises should be booked 12 to 15 months in advance.On the other end of the spectrum is a reverse strategy for saving: booking last minute. Last-minute cruises are usually defined as 60 to 90 days before departure, but be aware of all restrictions and policies such as no cancellation or refunds.For 2013, CruiseCritic.com says you'll find the best deals for European cruises, especially in the eastern and western Mediterranean. Prices also have dropped for Australia, Hawaii and Mexico cruises out of California. CruiseCritic.com also recommends booking with older ships that have been recently refurbished as opposed to new ships, which will cost you much more.Repositioning cruises also happen in spring (and fall) and can provide opportunities to find a low, last-minute fare. Many ships relocate to keep up with the shifting seasons. For example, ships might be heading north from Mexico to spend summertime in Alaska.Keep in mind, a repositioning cruise could mean many days spent at sea with few days spent in port. Also, you may have a long, expensive flight home.3. RoofSpring's mild temperatures mean it's a good time put a new roof on your home. Consider installing a cool roof (white or other lighter colors), which reflects the sun and keeps the roof temperature down as much as 50 degrees from that of a standard roof. Energy.gov, the website of the U.S. Department of Energy, says this can reduce your air-conditioner usage and cut down on energy bills.You'll get the best savings with a cool roof when you live in a hot climate. In cold climates, cool roofs could actually have the opposite effect and raise energy bills during the wintertime.  4. Office furnitureRight after tax day, you'll see some great deals on office furniture.Here's a hidden secret: To get an even better deal, check out county auctions. This is where county, schools and government agencies sell off their surplus office goods. Check with your county or a local university to see if there is an auction near you.I've found nice office chairs and file cabinets for $15, desks and cameras for $20.5. Tax Day freebiesAnd finally, to celebrate the end of tax season, some retailers are offering rewards or discounts.On April 15, Cinnabon is sweetening tax day with two free Cinnabon Bites at participating locations.Arby's will be offering special free foods via their site, arbys.com, after April 9. Look for more of these offers the closer we get to April 15."

6,TRAVEL,Don't Put Off Your Bucket List: Why I'm Glad I Didn't Wait to Experience South Africa,"Travelzoo, Contributor
A global Internet media company and trusted publisher of trave...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-africa-travel_us_5b9d05cce4b03a1dcc83d0a4,"I took the plunge and booked my dream vacation: 11 days in South Africa & Victoria Falls, including a safari. Here are my top six reasons why not to wait to take your dream African vacation.",2013-04-10,"The Drakensberg ('the Dragon Mountains') is the highest mountain range in Southern Africa, rising to 3, 482 meters (11, 424 ft) in height. In Zulu, it is referred to as uKhahlamba ('barrier of spears'), and in Sesotho as Maluti (also spelled Maloti).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d05cc2000002d00fdcdc1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most coveted perks at Travelzoo is the Travelzoo Experience, in which Deal Experts and other employees take advantage of the same travel, entertainment and local deals we publish to our subscribers and report back on their experience.A visit to South Africa has always been incredibly high on my bucket list and one I always expected to take later in life. However, sometimes a Top 20 deal is just too hard to pass up, even for us Deal Experts. So when one came across my desk, after crunching the numbers and downing a glass of wine for liquid courage, I took the plunge into booking my dream vacation: 11 days in South Africa & Victoria Falls, including a safari. Now having returned, I can't believe I had even considered putting off the trip.Here are my top six reasons why NOT to wait to take your dream African vacation: • The exchange rate: Even a hot deal to Africa can appear pricey at first glance, but realize that the vast majority of the trip cost is upfront and not while on vacation. Once on you're on the ground, it's incredibly easy to stick to a budget with an exchange rate that's highly favorable to the U.S. dollar. For example, a bottle of water at the airport: $.50; a cab ride across Cape Town: $6; a five-course lunch at a ""Top 100"" restaurant in the world: $50 per person. And not to forget, haggling is a part of life there, so there are great opportunities to strike a bargain at one of the numerous outdoor markets. In factoring in a trip to Europe and what you spend while you're there, the final comparison to South Africa is remarkably close. • The people: In all my world travels, I have never met a warmer and more welcoming people than the South Africans. The pride they have for their country and what it's overcome is palpable at every turn and we learned more from the people than we could have at any museum. Whether at our hotels, on safari or even on the street, everyone was incredibly friendly. The level of service we received was unparalleled and many times it felt like people sincerely cared that we had a memorable visit. • Any time of year is a great time of year: Typically you'll hear winter in South Africa (summer in North America) is the ideal time to safari, while the brush is low and dry, making it easiest to spot more elusive animals like the cats. However, that doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't experience safari at a different time of year -- it's just a different experience. In going during the tail end of summer, the scenery I experienced was green and lush but I still saw all the Big Five animals and loved the fact that I could enjoy the beautiful summer weather in coastal Cape Town. • Best of every world: Cape Town has something at its doorstep for everyone -- top-rated beaches; adventure sports; world-class restaurants; wine country; cultural museums; a thriving waterfront. No matter what your taste, there's something that will cater to your ideal vacation along with some stunning scenery. • Safari, not just for animal lovers: By no means am I a self-proclaimed animal lover and, admittedly, I even feared... would I get bored on safari? I mean, how many animals can you look at before enough is enough? I couldn't have been more wrong. A safari is a full-sensory experience that goes beyond staring at animals. Remember, you're not at a zoo. You're tracking wild animals, which comes with some intense, high drama and an adrenaline rushing moments just in and of itself.But my No. 1 reason why not to wait for to take your dream South African vacation? It's addictive. You'd be hard-pressed not to fall in love with the beauty, culture and people of South Africa and want to come (or in my case move) back. On the flight back home while lamenting the end of my journey, my saving grace was the realization that Africa is a huge continent and I've just dipped my toe in water. And having not put off taking this plunge, I now have more time ahead of me to explore the rest of it.-- Chris Vassil is a Travelzoo deal expert based in Chicago.

I suppose that several years of living in New York, coupled with my inherited biological traits, have programmed me to believe that I must always look like I'm going somewhere, and in a hurry, even when I'm not.",2013-04-10,"Hiking in tropical rainforest jungle, Palau, Micronesia",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d018f240000300094e847.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like many a city-dweller engaged in the journey from one place to the next, it seems as though I'm in a constant state of motion. If you were to see me heading west on 23rd Street, and then dashing across the park, and then jumping down the stairs -- two, sometimes three at a time -- of the N/R Station outside the Flatiron, you might think I was just another harried citizen, running typically (read: insanely) late for an appointment, annoyed by any impediments or hindrances he might encounter along the way -- specifically, the tourists outside of Eataly. The thing is, I'm not late. I walk fast. Very fast. Even for a New Yorker. And so, to this day, I continue on -- my eyes to the ground, my head bobbing from side to side, a pair of 1987-chic, grey Sony headphones plugged into my iPhone, a perpetually overstuffed tote bag slung over one shoulder -- at velocities just short of a run.Such would be the end of my story if it weren't for one small detail: I'm no longer in New York. This past January, I moved to a town in the remote jungle on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica, to study under Don and Amba Stapleton at the Nosara Yoga Institute, and to earn my yoga teacher's certification, and, in a more general sense, to calm the fuck down. If Costa Rica were to have a national motto, it'd be pura vida -- pure life, with the subtext of enjoy the moment, take it easy, no worries, and it will take at least 45 minutes to order lunch.Out here, in the hot and dry middle of nowhere, there's an even slower, dustier pace to everything, almost to the point of mandatory enforcement. Many things are slow this way. The Wi-Fi is slow, and I have to watch Downton Abbey in nightly 10-minute installments, not just because that's how long it takes to download a full episode, but also because the pacing of this Masterpiece Classic, in the context of this much slowness, seems like Quentin Tarantino has taken a stab at an unrated director's cut of The Bourne Identity. In this very strange and strangely wonderful place filled with boundless sunshine and sprawling beaches and rising kundalini and drum circles and goddess circles and various other enlightenment-related entities, I have been made acutely aware of one specific pedestrian problem. I am still walking incredibly, unbelievably fast.The citizens of this zen-centric town joke about how they see me on the road, through the thicket and from the porches of their cabinas, sometimes several times an afternoon, and sometimes traveling in the same direction, meaning that I'd already circled the entire Guiones section and was back for another loop. If anything, I walk even faster down here, assuming that forward gravity will allow me to outpace -- or, worst case scenario, squash to smithereens -- any of the very many creepy-crawly insect and/or reptile-like creatures I encounter on the jungle path from town during what I perceive to be the seamless wintertime transition from scorpion season to tarantula season. At the best of times, it's as though Groucho Marx has accidentally crash-landed in the Leonardo DiCaprio film The Beach.I assume that this walk, outside of any geographical context, is at least partially inherited, for the only man who walks even faster than I do is my father. He stands several inches shorter, and yet is perpetually two steps -- then 10 steps, then lost altogether -- ahead of me, his barrel-chested rib-cage (I inherited this, too) puffed out, his shoulders moving from side to side, a compact model of boundless forward propulsion.I have spent many an hour, when not in class or in a prolonged attempt to order some food, walking across sandy beaches and up dusty hills, both under the blazing noontime sun and in the darkened moonless night, trying to come up with some grand unifying theory of my walk and, more importantly, how to correct it. One afternoon at the main yoga studio, Dr. Stapleton, the co-director of our program, took us through a series of exercises to make us more aware of how we move across the earth. First, he had us walk around the room on our tiptoes, our chests thrust forward and our spines arched back, as though we were wearing high-heel shoes. Then, he had us walk on our heels, then, on the outer arches of our feet, and then, on the inner arches. We walked around the room with our toes pigeoned in, and we walked like Charlie Chaplin, our heels together and toes turned outwards, our hips undulating from side to side.He had us come to a standstill so that we could survey the results. To be sure, these ""bad walks"" made us hyper-aware about our own natural walks. The experiment needed to be corrected. ""Start walking,"" he instructed, and we did. ""Now, picture your pelvis moving up an escalator, and your tailbone moving down an escalator. Lean back slightly. Imagine your sternum moving forward. Now, picture a little rubber band attaching each leg up into its hip sockets. With each step, allow the raised leg to kick ever so slightly. Let that rubber band bring the leg back into its socket."" He could see that some of us were still a bit stiff. ""While you're doing this,"" he said, ""it really helps if you make a clicking sound with your tongue.""The room was soon filled with clicks and kicks and stomps. We were walking heavily, normally -- slowly. This was all well said and done in the yoga studio, but in the real world, where, for the most part, we have to wear shoes and worry about not looking crazy, remembering these cues was a bit of a challenge. With the outline of these exercises firmly planted in my mind, I again took to the beaches. At sunset, all sorts of New Age-types gather to salute the waning sun with chants, dances, and, for lack of a better term, gestural movements. I figured that the sand and surf might impede my trajectory, and also that clicking-to-oneself-while-walking might perhaps be one of the more normal activities that happens here. Instead of listening to The Smiths, I started piping through my headphones a curiously addictive song by Hawaiian musicians Raphael & Kutira, whose work might best be described as making Enya seem like AC/DC. The song, introduced to me by one of the instructors at the institute, was meant to invoke the slow and meandering spirit of a humpback whale giving birth (I'm not making this up). It would be the new soundtrack to my walks.Click, click. Click, click. Click, click., I went as I perambulated across the sand, the interpretive whale-birth music providing the correct dash of pace. Unfortunately, these personal motion experiments were interrupted by an added olfactory dimension by another sea creature, specifically, a dead sea turtle that had washed up on shore. It had already baked under the equatorial sun for several days, and, in harmony with the accompanying buzzards, stank to high heaven. The carcass didn't seem to be moving out with the tides. And so, having changed out of my New Balances and into a pair of Rainbow flip-flops, back to the town I took. To and fro, hither and thither, I tried to move as slowly as molasses -- and on a very literal level, this wasn't too difficult. For many kilometers, the roads are unpaved, and to keep the dust in check during the dry season, a large truck drives around, from the back of which workers do, in fact, pour piping hot vats of molasses onto the streets. The air smells faintly of gingerbread cookies and the inside of a diesel carburetor, and brown puddles of goo get stuck on everything -- legs, t-shirts, body hair. By the side of the road, there's a graveyard of discarded shoes, most of which have fallen victim to the ensuing mess. Indeed, such was the untimely fate of my Rainbow flip-flops who, after three weeks of service, came to an early demise when one of the straps broke.Around the time my flip-flops ended their service, I remembered that this wasn't my first trip to the jungle, or the first occurrence of such seemingly insurmountable problems of momentum. When I was in college, a group of us took a school-sponsored trip to study the ecology of the rainforests of Ecuador. On that trip, we spent many long, uninterrupted hours of attempting to quietly shuffle through the jungle, on the lookout for a long-toed tree sloth, or a superbly large caterpillar, or just about anything that wasn't a tree. We had to be very quiet, and it was, in no small part, as boring as any human endeavor one could possibly imagine. To keep us entertained, and to maintain our slow meander through the jungle, a friend and I came up with a routine. It was an homage of sorts to the crooning, staccato voice of Christopher Walken, principally as it pertained to his appearances on Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons.""Scooch closer, children. You're not scooching,"" we'd whisper to each other at markedly serious moments, or when we moved too fast. In fact, whenever we did gain too much speed, we'd simply have Mr. Walken make his way through a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's ""Feeling Groovy"" (something that he should totally do in real life). ""Slow down. You move. Too fast,"" one of us would warble in a terrible impression of Mr. Walken's voice. ""You've got. To make. The moment. LAST!"" The snickers that ensued scared off any wildlife found within a five mile radius. Naturally, we called this routine ""Walken in the Jungle."" When we returned home, we were going to have t-shirts made.Back on the remote, molasses-splattered streets of Costa Rica, my own voice, instructing me in the exacting art of hip placement, pelvis angle and forward thrust, was soon replaced by that of Mr. Walken's. I wish I could say that this was the resolve of my own particular story, and that, thanks to Mr. Walken, I'm now ambling through Nosara at a relaxed, steady gait. But such would not be true. The anatomy of yoga teaches us that a lot of our emotions are held in our hips, and perhaps this is the reason why I'm walking quickly, to make sure that nothing will settle, or open up, or release, for too long. I suppose that several years of living in New York, coupled with my inherited biological traits, have programmed me to believe that I must always look like I'm going somewhere, and in a hurry, even when I'm not. And I then see my time down here -- the range of its purpose and the length of its duration and the gravity of its scope -- in this hot, dusty and dry middle-of-jungle-place as a distraction from the speed at which I have always lived, the only remaining manifestation of which being the clip of my step.At nighttime, as I navigate the series of roads and beaches back to my cabina, I sometimes turn off my flashlight and take off my shoes and this changes the landscape quite a lot, and I tend to slow down a little -- but not much -- using sense alone to guide me home. As I do this, the image of Groucho Marx sometimes comes to mind. Apparently, he's crash-landed into my own particular motion picture, dressed in a bowtie and tails and -- strangely enough -- a hula skirt, which seems appropriate, because my image is that of him gently, comically dancing to a Raphael & Kutira number. If Mr. Marx were still alive, it'd make an excellent cover song.For more by Martin Marks, click here. For more on yoga, click here. "

Envy erases our understanding that being happy for another's success and joy does not affect or detract from our personal success and contentment.The more I rejoice in another's accomplishments, the more I am inspired to focus on my own desires and passions.Lately, I've noticed envy lurking all over Facebook. She creeps in between the exclamation points, smiley faces and thumbs ups.She is taking advantage of our weakness. The human brain was not created to function healthfully in our technologically ravaged modern world. I believe social media is causing us all to become slightly insane -- delusional.As human beings, we perceive what is in front of us as reality; we trust what we see as truth, but it isn't. Through our engagement in the daily scroll of hundreds of self edited and airbrushed status updates, we perpetuate the spread of a lethal disease -- the belief in an archetype of the perfect life, that does not exist -- always happy and shiny, untouched by life's ups and downs.This inundation of perfection blinds us with jealousy.People use Facebook to share the highlights of their lives. Just as a child proudly parades her masterpiece of crayon scribbles in front of her mother, hoping for the applause of oohs and ahhs, we tout our accomplishments to hundreds of virtual friends, awaiting the thumbs ups and comments, searching for the same thing -- validation that we are doing a good job -- we are important.Facebook is a platform for creating and sharing the life we want people to think we live. Anyone would be envious of a life free of pain, sadness, loneliness and heartbreak. The duality of life evaporates as we begin to dissolve into the monotony of perfection. This is the cause of our envy. We have a choice to see Facebook for what it is, a sound byte of real life and a reservoir of hungry hearts searching for acknowledgment, but the blur of jealousy overtakes us.We have fallen prey to the delusion that every one else's life is happier than ours, more productive and more valuable.We forget. We forget that there is something greater that dwells amidst the accolades, the trips and the fancy meals -- the every day of life.This understanding has become lost as social networking sites become our primary source of communication. We deliberately try to set ourselves apart, to be seen, to be happier than the update before us.We are creating a struggle that doesn't need to exist. We don't need to set ourselves apart because, we are all the same. How do we reengage with this sameness, honoring the trueness of the human experience? The first step: Set limits with Facebook. I very seldom go on the newsfeed. I find it to be the quick sand of fallacy.""Life happens between the snap shots. Life is what gets us from one snap shot to the next."" -- A quote from a movie I saw once.When we are lashed with status after status of overly exuberant tan people doing yoga on white sand beaches and rock formations, pictures of new houses and cars, pictures vomited on by quotes of high vibration/low vibration explanations (quotes so optimistic they make me want to punch someone), food that looks styled from a magazine shoot and people who look styled from a magazine shoot -- we dismiss the in between, the other 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds of daily life. We fall ill with the virus of illusion, infecting the mind with delusion, feeding our fever of jealousy.We think everything is better 'out there.'It's not. All of these other people carry the same self doubt, confusion and bouts of loneliness you and I do. We are all just trying to figure it out, seeing our way through life from our own unique perspective of the world.I write this piece as a call to action. If more of us write about how it really is, take pictures of how it really is and tell it like it really is, envy would take a vacation. We would see from our different perspectives, that we are all having the same experience.My mission on Facebook is to bring a flicker of raw and gritty day to day, within this virtual train wreck of grandiosity and new age fairytale. Despite my efforts, there have been many times women have approached me and stated,""I live vicariously through you on Facebook. Your life is so amazing.""No. My life is real. Flawed. Cracked. Beautiful. Balanced with missteps, mistakes and good judgments.I have worked diligently to be where I am right now, accompanied by sacrifice -- a divorce from my husband, a divorce from everything I knew, making choices that took me in a direction I never expected. I have tried to reflect the truth of my life, the uncensored and uncut version in my writings, but if I am permeating a scent of idealism that others pine for, then I am doing a disservice to myself and to them. I am creating a veneer of falsehood, feeding envy along the way.I must re-evaluate the image I am projecting into the ether of the internet. I encourage all of us to reflect on our online actions because, behind the split second capture of an Instagram picture of posed smiles, is a story, a life's story; a story we all know and for some reason like to avoid.Let's stop avoiding it and share it openly and completely. Instead of the summits of our lives, let's share the trek too. For those who have reached the summit of Mt. Everest, the story they tell, that they want to tell and others want to hear is of the climb itself because, that is the most important part.Here is a portion of a Facebook status update I wrote a week ago:Please don't envy me because I am you, just with different features and freckly skin. I have some really shitty days and some really good days. I cry, I yell, I laugh.Sometimes, I get upset and I send impulsive texts filled with nonsense to my boyfriend, that I wish I could erase before they turn green. There are days I feel confused, and days everything makes sense. I have been offered some deserved opportunities over the years, a product of un-waivering discipline and hard work, but my daily life is quietly mundane; I spend most of my time with my daughters, or alone- writing and teaching at my studio. I have issues with my parents. I have issues. Period.I have an obsession with pretzel m & m's-I eat way too many of them. I get lonely, really lonely -- I cry and then, I get over it. I get angry, really angry -- I yell or I cry and then, I get over it. I look in the mirror in the morning, and I hate my hair. Sometimes I want to throw my children out of a window because they drive me crazy when they fight. I just finished yelling at them for not going to bed. When I need a break from my seriousness, I watch awful movies on my computer in my bed while eating Triscuits. I will go to sleep tonight at 8:30 because that's how I roll. I don't have a glamorous social life -- I'd rather be at home even if I had the option of being out on the scene. I'm a girl who found what I love, and I work really damn hard for everything I have created.Don't envy me. I don't envy you, because I know we are all the same-at least that's my perspective.   -- Rebecca LammersenFirst published on elephant journalFor more by Rebecca Lammersen, click here.

But a clothing swap full of chatty, diverse, creative women can serve as a fantastic reminder that clothes should fit our bodies, not vice versa.",2013-04-10,"Lots of bright messy colorful clothing, abstract background.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d078c2200005700d97804.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'm a dedicated thrifter, I pass along my underutilized duds to friends and family on a regular basis, and I consign the vast majority of my shopping blunders. I feel like a clothing recycling pro. And yet this weekend marked the first time I'd ever participated in a clothing swap. I even hosted it.So first off, it was a blast. The mountain of garments you see above wasn't even the half of it. By the time all 15 women had arrived, my armchair, dining room table, and couch were all buried beneath sweaters, blouses, and jackets. Everyone was excited and talkative and generous, and no fights broke out over that gorgeous silk Vince tunic or the sparkly sequined tank top.Second, it was total mayhem. We attempted to create ""stations"" for various garment types -- skirts here, slacks there, outerwear over yonder -- and that helped somewhat. But the unwieldy pile of sweaters in the middle of the dining room table kept absorbing workout clothes, dresses, and accessories. It was comically disorganized by the end, but we muddled through. And the chaos actually served as a point of bonding for the participants.Aside from having a great time with friends on a Saturday afternoon, I learned from this experience. I participated, but I also observed. And here's what I saw:1. No one felt self-conscious. I had set up a full-length mirror out in the main swap area, but there was also a more secluded one in the bedroom. Most of my gal pals had absolutely no problem stripping to their skivvies in full view. I mean, there were some pants pulled on beneath skirts and plenty of women had worn nude tanks for modesty reasons, but it was basically an open dressing room free-for-all. I loved how comfortable everyone felt and how judgement-free the event was.2. Everyone tried items that fell outside their comfort zones. Pants lovers gave skirts a whirl. Tee shirt devotees tried out tunics. It was a no-risk proposition, and I saw many of my girlfriends pulling on garments that they'd never have tried in a retail environment, and finding themselves surprised and pleased. Style horizons were expanded at this event, people.3. We fit into each others' stuff. There were women from size zero to 14 at this swap; petite women, tall women, curvy women, non-curvy women. There were women with big hips and women with flat chests. And it was such fun to see how utterly arbitrary clothing sizes are as garments got passed from body type to body type. Dresses that looked awkward and odd on one woman looked chic and sassy on another. Blouses that never quite sat right on one body shape appeared custom-made for another. And we were all delighted to see our underutilized clothes looking so sharp on our fellow swappers. Women can get hung up on garment size and fit. These mental roadblocks seem to scold and judge us, shaming our curves or lack thereof for failing to look ""right"" in certain designs. We stare at ourselves in fitting room mirrors, see ill-fitting clothing, and feel defeated, awkward, and wrong. But a clothing swap full of chatty, diverse, creative women can serve as a fantastic reminder that clothes should fit our bodies, not vice versa. Passing around an unusual piece and seeing it on a petite curvy frame, a tall lanky one, and a super athletic one illustrates how garments can look drastically different with just a few inches added here and subtracted there. And this reminds us that our bodies are not wrong for failing to fit into clothes. If the clothes don't work, it's their fault and other, better designs that complement our natural shapes should be sought out instead.I also learned that -- no matter how much I want them to work -- flowy, wide-legged, Katherine Hepburn pants still look goofy on me. But my friend Maureen's ruched blouse? Pure dynamite."
