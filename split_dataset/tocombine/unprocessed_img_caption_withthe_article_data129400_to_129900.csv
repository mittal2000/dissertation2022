Meet Lawrence Burst (now that's a middle name) Sperry, the inventor of the autopilot.1914 - American pilot Lawrence Burst Sperry invents the autopilot, giving pilots time to pursue other activities in the cockpit.Lawrence Sperry and his wife Winifred, a noted silent film star. She wasn't the one in the cockpit when Lawrence ""invented"" the Mile High Club. 1916 - Sperry, the same pilot who invented the autopilot, disengages it during a flight and crashes. Duck hunters find him and a woman treading water naked near the coast of Long Island. They insist the force of the crash knocked off their clothes. Everyone else credits them for inventing the Mile High Club.   In the old days, passengers didn't wear flip flops, shorts or tank tops on airplanes.

The days of dressing formal for flights are over and people start to fly in whatever attire they choose. A first-class seat that transforms into a bed for two? #AskingForIt1996 - Airlines practically promote the Mile High Club. British Airways introduces a first-class seat that reclines and transforms into a bed for two. You guys are scaring Singapore Airlines.1997 - The airlines' promotions work a little too well. Singapore Airlines officials say Mile Highers are a ""particularly worrying trend."" Please. Think of the children. (Photo via N.

While its general knowledge that chocolate is bad for pets, there are other considerations we must be aware of. Chocolate or public enemy number one contains methylxanthines, which eaten by your pets can spell disaster. Effects to pets can range from vomiting, panting, diarrhea, abnormal heart rhythm, seizures and even death. Remember if any of your loved ones get you some chocolate or even a secret admirer, make sure to keep it in a secure place out of reach of pets. Other types of candy besides chocolate are a safe alternative then? Wrong, candy is sweetened with xylitol. Xylitol causes your pets insulin to rise. This can cause your pets blood sugar to drop and can cause liver failure. Symptoms can include vomiting, lethargy, and loss of coordination. Please do also make sure to keep all types of candies away from your pet.  Flowers, the universal symbol of love are also a matter to be concerned about. Flowers are given to moms, wives, girlfriends, friends, crushes...you name it. While not all types of flowers are harmful to pets, some are deadly. Be cautious of lilies, these are fatal to cats if ingested. Setting the mood for that loved one? Looking to fill the air with love and warmth, well be sure to set those candles away from low areas or near the edge of anything. Pets curiosity can cause them to nudge candles while smelling them, or wagging tails due to the excitement of guests can easily knock them to the floor. As such as you may want a bright burning flame of love in your life from cupid, flames engulfing other parts of your residence clearly are unwanted. Now go ahead, enjoy your day of love. Upset because this article doesn't apply to you? Of course it does, if you have a pet, then you have a Valentine! Spend the day with them, get them a new toy, maybe some special treats, go for a peaceful walk, and then cuddle them like never before while enjoying a movie.Rescue Idiot"
2,ENVIRONMENT,Climate Change A Growing Concern For Winter Olympics Hosts,"Climate Central, Climate Central",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-winter-olympics_us_5bb15066e4b09bbe9a5e5094,Sochi organizers stashed 16 million cubic feet of snow from last winter under tarps in case of dry or warm conditions this,2014-02-08,"THE 2014 WINTER OLYMPICS MOUNTAIN VENUES, SOCHI, RUSSIA - MARCH 17, 2013: This is a satellite image of the 2014 Winter Olympics Mountain Venues, Sochi, Russia collected on March 17, 2013. (Photo DigitalGlobe via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15066260000cf00818379.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From Climate Central's Brian Kahn:Climate change became an official Winter Olympic issue in 1998 in the wake of the Nagano Games. The four subsequent host cities, including Sochi, have made strides to address climate change and reduce or offset their greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Games and the athletes that participate in them have been unwittingly preparing for climate change over their 90-year history.The wrap-up report for the 1998 Winter Olympics contained the first mention of climate change in the context of the Olympics. The authors of the report said, “The depletion of the ozone layer and global warming are two examples of issues affecting our natural ecosystem on a worldwide scale. Therefore, striving to host the Olympic Winter Games in harmony with nature is especially important, and we ask the IOC and future Olympic Winter Games host cities to pay close attention to the environment.”It could, of course, be argued that trying to put the Games in harmony with the environment is a fool’s errand. The Olympics involve massive construction projects, intensive use of water resources, and huge amounts of carbon emissions to fly in people from all over the world. Given that the Olympics aren’t going away soon, though, each organizing committee since Nagano has tried, in varying degrees, to limit their impact.Sochi, this year’s Winter Olympics host, has already offset 360,000 metric tons of carbon. Organizers say that’s the amount of carbon emissions released through construction, athletes traveling to and from Sochi, and other actions directly related to putting on the Games (though there’s skepticism that it’s a realistic number).And though offsetting 360,000 metric tons of carbon is notable for a single event, it’s barely a blip in the world’s carbon budget. That number is less than 0.01 percent of the total global emissions annually and a notch below the 2008 emissions for the entire country of Bermuda’s (which, incidentally, will be competing in the Sochi Games).Rather than token gestures to cut emissions, the real lessons gleaned from the Olympics may date back to the first Games in 1924 in Chamonix. It was there, in a ski village in southeastern France, that organizers used weather insurance to prepare for the vagaries of mountain climates. Minimizing risks due to weather have been at the Games’ core ever since.“The very first Games organizers in Chamonix knew if weather didn't hold up, people wouldn’t show up and they’d be left holding the bag,” said Daniel Scott, a global tourism professor at the University of Waterloo.Though back then the Games weren’t the multi-billion dollar endeavor they are now, organizers still had to find a way to recoup the costs of putting on 16 events and hosting 258 athletes. Weather insurance offered one form to ensure they did, and each subsequent Games has adopted some form of it.With climate change expected to raise temperatures by up to 7.9°F by the 2080s at the 19 previous Winter Olympic host cities, weather insurance could play an increasingly large role in insulating the Games from losses due to weather delays or cancellations.Organizers at the 1932 Games in Lake Placid, N.Y. also tinkered with the formula for successfully managing weather risks by bringing hockey indoors for the first time. Though that didn’t become widely adopted until the Oslo Games 20 years later, it showed that indoor hockey could be done successfully. The 1960s is when technology started to become a larger part of staging the Games, though.""The Olympics really started to adopt technologies from the 1960s on with refrigeration technologies being used for skating and bobsled and luge, as well as snow compacting becoming standard,"" said Michael Hall, an expert in globalization and tourism at the University of Canterbury.By 1980, when Lake Placid hosted the Winter Olympics again, organizers were tinkering with making snow on the alpine ski courses. The practice became commonplace after the 1998 Games in Calgary, and this year Sochi is boasting an armada of over 500 snowmaking guns, one of the largest in Europe.Those adaptations have been crucial in bringing the Winter Games' to ever-warmer locales, including Sochi, which has more in common with 1996 Summer Games' host Atlanta than with most winter host cities. Yet while none of the changes were done specifically to address climate change, they will likely play a key role in ensuring the future of the Winter Olympics in a warming world. However, not every innovation is likely to stick.Sochi organizers stashed 16 million cubic feet of snow from last winter under tarps in case of dry or warm conditions this year at the alpine venues (though it looks like it won’t be needed).“I don't know that saving snow from year before will really catch on,” Scott said. “Other places will focus more on making snow. And what all Games now have to do is have two locations (for ski events): a primary location and backup location. That’s how they’re building in that resiliency.”Scott said in the future, Games might have to rely more heavily on these backup sites, which are generally at higher elevations but further from the host cities. A map showing how average winter temperatures have increased in the U.S. since 1970.Advanced snowmaking equipment could also allow skiing and snowboarding events to go on even when temperatures climb above freezing. Technology currently in use at Zermatt, a resort in the Swiss Alps, relies on a machine called the Snowmaker. It was originally developed to keep miners in South Africa cool, and is water and energy intensive, but it’s not dependent on temperatures below 32°F. That kind of technology could conceivably become more valuable to organizers of future Winter Olympics as the climate continues to warm.That includes in the U.S., where average winter temperatures have warmed 0.61°F per decade since 1970. Snow cover has decreased across the Northern Hemisphere over that same time period, but particularly in spring.Those trends are likely to continue into the next century. Research presented at the American Geophysical Union Meeting in December that looked at 18 ski resorts in the western U.S. found that by 2080, temperatures are likely to increase at all resorts and snowfall is likely to decline by more than 75 percent at 10 resorts while increasing at only four.Hall said an even bigger threat than a gradual rise in temperatures is the possibility for extreme weather event to increase in alpine resorts.""Some resorts will undoubtedly have to improve their capacity to respond to flood events as well as extreme snowfalls and droughts,"" he said.Ultimately, most of those preparations will happen between the Games. But when eyes turn to the Winter Olympics every 4 years, they provide a platform for the world see how the future is developing right in front of our eyes."

Co-administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 1,400 domestic species of plants and animals and 600 foreign species are currently protected under this law -- and less than one percent of those species have ever been delisted because of extinction, according to Defenders of Wildlife. Species can gain protection under the act via a classification of ""endangered,"" meaning ""a species is considered in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range,"" or ""threatened,"" meaning ""a species is considered likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future, but is not currently in danger of extinction,"" according to the USFWS. Protection under this law warrants advanced habitat protection, extensive monitoring and take-and-trade bans or restrictions.The Endangered Species Act has always been a controversial topic, as some critics argue it's not fully successful and hinders economic development. This past week, 13 GOP lawmakers called for an overhaul of this act, suggesting states should have more say over animals within their borders, that there needs to be ""more accurate economic impact studies"" and other suggestions, according to AP. Experts, however, say the overhaul is unlikely. Proponents argue that species resurgence takes time, and relies on multiple factors like the amount of time spent under the Endangered Species Act, critical habitat protection and recovery plans, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Amid this controversy, here are nine examples that prove the Endangered Species Act can be successful. "

(Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb743401f0000250124fba6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jeff Fedotin, National Football PostHe’s six years younger than Aaron Rodgers, as athletic as Cam Newton, much bigger than Russell Wilson and as clutch as they come.If you had to select one player to build your team around at the most important position, you would choose Andrew Luck.“He has the stuff that makes legends,” said Colts linebacker Robert Mathis.Luck is poised to leave his legacy on the game because he has all of the qualities, which would make him the No. 1 selection in this quarterback-driven league if NFL general managers held a draft. (For what it’s worth, Deion Sanders took Luck first in the 2014 Pro Bowl Draft.)SmartsThe high school valedictorian earned a 3.48 GPA as an architectural design major at Stanford, but his intelligence transcends book smarts and extends to his mastery of football concepts.Former Colts offensive coordinator/interim coach Bruce Arians — who was on the Colts and Steelers offensive staffs, respectively, when Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger were rookies — told me that Luck had more offensive responsibilities than either did during their rookie years.A stout Steelers defense and veteran running backs Jerome Bettis and Willie Parker buttressed Roethlisberger. So Big Ben was often reduced to completing play-action and third-down passes as a rookie.During his first year with the Colts, Manning would have two or three plays sent to him from the sideline and he’d choose one. But Manning did not yet extensively direct the no-huddle offense that would become his calling card.By his rookie year, Luck was already orchestrating that hurry-up attack — something Manning did not do until Year No. 2.Athleticism Though Luck is a classic dropback passer, his NFL Scouting Combine numbers mirrored those of Newton, considered one of the game’s most multi-dimensional athletes. Both ran the 40-yard dash in 4.59 seconds, and Luck jumped two inches higher (36) on the vertical leap and two inches shorter (124) on the broad jump.The versatile Luck can tuck the ball and run, having amassed 632 rushing yards and nine rushing touchdowns in his two years.“If the team needs a first down, and guys are covered,” said Luck modestly; his demeanor and media-friendly nature are other positive attributes, “I’ll do my best.”ArmLuck’s arm is both strong and accurate as exemplified by the biggest play of his young career — the game-winning throw to wide receiver T.Y. Hilton, which traveled more than 50 yards on a rope and hit Hilton in stride during the Colts’ 45-44 playoff victory against the Chiefs.“That’s just Andrew being Andrew,” Hilton said. “He makes big-time plays in big-time games.”ClutchnessWhether or not you believe clutchness is an intangible factor or a series of statistical anomalies, Luck seems to have an “it” factor and an ability to lead his team back regardless of the circumstance.In just 35 career games, Luck has recorded a staggering eight fourth-quarter comebacks and 11 game-winning drives. He has seven wins after the Colts trailed by double-digits in a game.This season he led the Colts to victory when they were down by 3 in the fourth quarter to the Raiders, 5 in the fourth to the Seahawks and 12 in the fourth to the Texans.And, of course, the most impressive of them all was the playoff win against the Chiefs after Indianapolis trailed 38-10 in the third quarter, making it the second largest comeback in NFL postseason history.“I saw the fire in his eye. He wanted to win this game no matter what the scoreboard was,” said Colts wide receiver LaVon Brazill, following the playoff contest. “And he came out here and won this game for us.”Making Others Around Him BetterElevating the play of their teammates is an attribute of the best quarterbacks, and — as Brazill alluded to — Luck certainly possesses that. During his rookie year, he took a Colts team, which went 2-14 the year before, and improved it to an 11-5 playoff team.In his next year, he led the Colts to the AFC South title, even though he was without his best target, wide receiver Reggie Wayne, who tore his ACL in Week 7.Fifteen teams had more Pro Bowlers named to the 2014 game than the Colts, and Indianapolis’ tally included long snapper Matt Overton. (Wilson and Colin Kaepernick’s teams combined to have 12 more Pro Bowlers than Luck’s squad.)DurabilityAt a linebacker-like 6-4 and 239 pounds, Luck has the size to endure a pounding.It’s why when things break down he can become a running threat, taking on defensive backs and even linebackers.His sturdy frame is part of the reason he has not missed a start during his two years, even though he has yet to play behind a strong pass-protection unit. During Luck’s rookie year, his offensive line allowed the ninth most sacks in the NFL.YouthLuck is only 24, meaning he has likely 12 to 14 years left where he can play at a high level and making him more valuable than the four best quarterbacks in the NFL — Manning (age 37), Tom Brady (36), Drew Brees (35) and Rodgers (30).Luck has not reached that tier yet, but he continues to improve. From 2012 to 2013, he increased his completion percentage by more than six points and reduced his interceptions by nine.Luck’s long career is not only just getting started, but the best of it also lies ahead.Follow Jeff on Twitter: @JFedotinJeff Fedotin has written for Packers.com, Pro Football Weekly, ESPN The Magazine, the Lawrence (Kan.)
