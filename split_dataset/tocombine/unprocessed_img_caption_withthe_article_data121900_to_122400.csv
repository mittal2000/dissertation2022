Maybe even the greatest of all-time. Because of this awesomeness, it believes it has the right, if not the obligation, to tell the rest of the world what to do. Yay America.  Those of us who were raised in the United States were taught that this country is the most exceptional country in the world. We are ""the best and the brightest,"" have the world's greatest democracy and by far the best standard of living. Except it's not true.St. Pete for Peace has done extensive research to compare the status of the United States to other countries with some surprising results.

American exceptionalism, manifest destiny, and the notion that the U.S. is God's chosen country, has made a comeback.In fact, in the context of the current anti-Russia climate, the Washington establishment is whipping people into a pro-America hysteria that much of the country has seemingly bought into.Ironically started in 1929 by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin as a condemnation of the American working class' unwillingness to foment revolution, the expression ""American exceptionalism"" has only recently become the rallying cry of cheerleaders for the U.S.  Used as a justification for the U.S. to militarily intervene in foreign countries in order to 'bring liberty and democracy to the rest of the world', the U.S. neoconservative movement made the phrase go viral leading up to the 2012 presidential elections. Now, the expression, and the sentiments behind it have become so prevalent that if you dare utter doubt that the U.S. is exceptional you run the risk of being labeled un-American. ""Peel a few layers back and the rise of faith in American exceptionalism doesn't evince superiority. It indicates fear."" -- Terrence McCoy This information is not intended to be a negative reflection of America as much as it is a reality check. The belief in U.S. international superiority is based on wishful thinking rather than the truth. Instead of continuing to fall behind, we have an opportunity to face our deficiencies and learn from other countries. Are America's best days behind her? This may be true if we refuse to acknowledge our true place in the world.Check out the entire American Exceptionalism Report Card and see if you agree with George Carlin who once famously said, ""It's called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.""Melissa Baird contributed to this article."
1,QUEER VOICES,#ROSWEGLYN- A Youtube 'Meet and Greet' That Became So Much More,"Megan Evans, ContributorGay rights activist, Blogger and Youtuber",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rosweglyn-a-youtube-meet-_b_5242789.html,"Youtube hasn't just brought ROSWEGLYN together as friends, but it also has brought a whole new community along with it where acceptance is key.",2014-05-02,2014-04-30-1002682_10100402346313797_7609712674917625679_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-30-1002682_10100402346313797_7609712674917625679_n-thumb.jpg,"On the 26th April 2014, 600 people headed towards the Mermaid Theatre in London. The doors were set to open at 12:45pm, and the queues began hours before. At 12pm we drove past the queue in our taxi, heading for the back door. One of the fans spotted us and started, in shock, to frantically wave. We were not arriving to the theatre as an attendee, but we were arriving as the Youtube vloggers that they were queuing up to see. To say that the experience was surreal, would be an under statement. Alongside me in the taxi sat my beautiful wife Whitney and our fellow Youtuber's and dearest friends, Kaelyn and Lucy. We had been planning this event for months. Dubbed ""ROSWEGLYN"", an amalgamation of all of our names, we had decided to hold a meet and greet with Youtuber's Rose and Rosie (The Roses) and Kaelyn and Lucy (Luclyn). With no managers or agents, we had planned this event completely by ourselves. When we started out we literally thought we could just meet in a random coffee shop or park and a handful of people would turn up. How wrong we were. When we initially wanted to gather a rough idea of attendees, we had nearly 1000 people RSVP. We realised we had to scrap our park plans and found a theatre that could hold 600 attendees.Months later, with organisations, a photobooth and merchandise all ordered and booked, the day was finally upon us. We still couldn't believe that 600 people wanted to come meet and greet us. We are, after all, just ordinary people that upload regular footage to Youtube of our lives. From that has grown a friendship between the 6 of us, and for that we are forever grateful. After driving past the queue to the venue, it started to dawn on us the scale of the event. Whilst waiting backstage my sister, who was there to help at the event, came running in to let us know she had just caused the ""Mexican wave"" amongst the crowd, everyone was in great spirits. Unfortunately the morning had not run so smoothly for all of us as anticipated. As we were heading into London Paddington station, where we were due to meet Rose and Rosie, we received a frantic call from Lucy, informing us that Rose had collapsed at Reading station and was currently in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. We were all in complete shock and of course very worried as to what had happened to our dear friend Rose. Just the day before all 6 of us had met up, we had a laugh at Diva magazines photoshoot and shared dominos whilst running over the script with our host for the event, Bella Qvist. How could it be that Rose was now on her way to hospital and no longer attending? Heart broken, as cliché as it sounded, the show had to go on. Kaelyn went on stage ahead of our host to inform the crowd as to what had happened to Rose, though word had spread fast from Twitter. Whilst undoubtedly upset, the crowd were thankful Rose was ultimately ok and still very happy for the event to go ahead. The four of us made our way on to the stage, from great introductions written by Rose and delivered brilliantly by Bella. Personally I love the fact that we are ""practically joint at the face"". We then proceeded with a half an hour Q&A, which I must admit was rather nerve wracking suddenly speaking in front of 600 people with all eyes on you. We successfully made our way through the questions, ranging from what characteristics do we like most about one another, to Lucy's favourite character from Harry Potter. We took a stage 'selfie' with the audience and we sang Happy Birthday to a 14 year old who was in attendance with her mum. Even now the experience is all completely surreal, and the meet and greet was yet to come. When we started to meet and greet all the attendees, they lined up in wrist band order given out the order they arrived to the venue. We didn't realise how exhausting it would be to meet all 600, we stood on our feet for 5 hours, and admittedly had to change from our heels to flat shoes. However, we would do it all again as it was amazing to meet each and every attendee. What was unwavering was the overwhelming feeling from meeting all these lovely people who had been watching our videos from years or months, and the impact we had on them. Some shook, some cried, some were unable to get words out. We were just as nervous and emotional as they were! We are honoured that attendees traveled from Australia, Hong Kong, Denmark, Germany and Sweden to name a few, just to meet us. Knowing the impact that we have on these attendees, mainly young LGBT teens, but also older followers and parents to, is a incomprehensible feeling. We were told that by putting our lives out there, living visibly as a happily married femme couple, we have made lives easier for the younger (and older) generation in accepting who they are or knowing that they will end up happy. To be seen as role models truly makes what we do all the more worthwhile. What we created wasn't just a Youtube event, is was a safe haven for LGBT teens to meet up and make friends. They frequently commented how amazing it was to feel they could be themselves. After the event it really did dawn on me, that other than going to gay clubs when you're 18 years of age, there isn't a safe space where you can meet other LGBT people and feel that you're not alone. Where being gay is better than ok, in fact it's pretty awesome. Youtube hasn't just brought ROSWEGLYN together as friends, but it also has brought a whole new community along with it where acceptance is key. If only this could transfer to the outside world. If we keep going, hopefully one day it will. "
2,BUSINESS,Not a Zero-Sum Game: The Case for a Higher Minimum Wage,"Jabril Faraj, ContributorFreelance writer, storyteller and journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/minimum-wage-economics_b_5244192.html,"The share of wealth controlled by the super-rich in the United States has actually increased about five percentage points (from 17 to 23 percent) since 2008. Is this the ""free market"" at work?",2014-05-02,"A chart prepared by Senate Democrats rests on an easel on the Senate steps before a news conference urging approval for raising the minimum wage, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, April 2, 2014. In the coming days, the Senate could debate a plan by Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin that would gradually lift today's minimum wage of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 by 2016. President Barack Obama wants to increase the hourly minimum wage as part of an election-year economic agenda focused on working families. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30bee26000036008203ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Photo: Creative Commons License, Fibonacci Blue, flickrIn last year's State of the Union speech, President Obama called for congress to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 an hour. Since then, the conversation has shifted to an even-higher $10.10. But there has been a heated debate over the effects of such an increase. One side argues that a wage increase will put more money in people's pockets and aid in the economic recovery. The other claims that such a large increase will put a strain on businesses, causing them to lay off workers. Others still, simply believe that minimum wage workers shouldn't be making any more than they already are. This topic is most certainly a complicated one. To make matters more difficult, each camp inevitably views the issue through the lens of their own belief system, leading to a myriad of assumptions, speculations and hypotheticals that produce different conclusions across the board. So, where do we start? Let's begin by saying this: the American system is broken. We know the United States lags behind other developed nations in most education categories. In 2012, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) found that, among the 65 countries polled, U.S. students ranked 29th, 22nd and 19th respectively in mathematics, science and reading levels. Harvard professor Jan Rivkin, who co-chairs a project on U.S. competitiveness, says these rankings haven't been caused by America falling behind but, instead, by the country's general education stagnation. ""While our scores in reading are the same as 2009, scores from Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Poland and others have improved and now surpass ours,"" she said in an interview with NPR. ""Other countries that were behind us, like Italy and Portugal, are now catching up. We are in a race in the global economy. The problem is not that we're slowing down. The problem is that the other runners are getting faster.""We know that the once-strong American middle class has eroded while the super-rich prosper. In a recent article published by The New York Times, Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist, said that, though middle-class Americans have historically been better off than those in other countries, they haven't been able to keep pace with other nations over the last 20 to 30 years. ""In 1960, we were massively richer than anyone else. In 1980, we were richer. In the 1990s, we were still richer,"" said Katz. ""The idea that the median American has so much more income than the middle class in all other parts of the world is not true these days."" In fact, median per capita income in the United States has stayed flat since 2010 while Britain, the Netherlands and Canada have seen increases between 14 and 20 percent over that same period. However, if we step outside the middle class an even grimmer picture starts to form. The same April 22nd New York Times piece notes, ""At the 20th percentile -- where someone is making less than four-fifths of the population -- income in both the Netherlands and Canada was 15 percent higher than income in the United States in 2010.""How can we account for these discrepancies and lack of growth? In a Washington Post piece early this year on economic mobility, David Autor, an MIT economist who writes frequently about issues related to inequality, said many economists will use the evidence to support their preconceived notions about the effectiveness of government programs, such as Pell grants, Head Start and nutritional supplements for children. But, he said you could also draw another conclusion: ""you can view this as: Social policies have fought market forces to a draw.""What The Market Wants, The Market Gets At the basis of American Capitalism is the idea of a ""free market"" or market economy where supply and demand influence investment, production and distribution, free from intervention. Our nation has operated under the theory -- or assumption -- that this is the path to innovation, wealth and growth. But is it?The very richest continue to accumulate wealth while everyone else's incomes have remained flat. Atif Mian, a professor of economics at Princeton University, and Amir Sufi, Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago, display in a piece on wealth inequality that the percentage of wealth held by the top 0.1 percent of households in the United States has risen from a steady 10 percent from 1940 to 1970 to more than 20 percent of the country's total wealth today. The massive gains this segment has enjoyed over the last 30 years have brought it back to the levels of wealth they held earlier in the 20th century, peaking at the end of the 1920s immediately before the Great Depression. That event started a steady decline over the next 15 to 20 years -- the wealth figures from the ""Great Recession,"" however, tell a very different story.The share of wealth controlled by the super-rich in the United States has actually increased about five percentage points (from 17 to 23 percent) since 2008. So, as opposed to what we see as a result of the Great Depression, the rich have actually gotten richer since the economy tanked. How did this happen? Well, for one, we had the bailout, which redistributed $700 billion from the pockets of taxpayers into the very institutions that had caused the crash through their questionable lending practices. Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, J.P Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs all received between $10 billion and $25 billion as a result of the legislation. Nine of the banks, including those listed above, who were the largest recipients of bailout money paid about 5,000 of their traders and bankers bonuses of at least $1 million each. We've also seen the trimming down of the labor force -- people have been asked to work more for less pay. This trend, which had been justified by the dire economic conditions, hasn't subsided since the beginning of the recovery. Companies have simply ""made due"" which has allowed top executives to pocket more while recording record profits. In addition, some experts cite the decline in labor unions, trade liberalization and a dwindling minimum wage for the loss of the middle-income jobs that were once the backbone of America.Is this the ""free market"" at work? Thomas Jefferson, himself, warned of the dangers of massive corporations and special interests more than 150 years earlier. In an 1825 letter to William Branch Giles, Jefferson spoke to the former statesman of ""usurpation"" and ""the treasonable views of the federal party."" He warned of the demise of the current government and the institution of an Aristocracy by those who didn't uphold the values on which the country was founded. Jefferson said they, ""now look to a single and splendid government of an Aristocracy, founded on banking institutions and monied in corporations under the guise and cloak of their favored branches of manufactures commerce and navigation, riding and ruling over the plundered ploughman and beggared yeomanry."" This warning is especially poignant today considering the recent study by researchers at Princeton and Northwestern University that concluded the United States is, essentially, just that -- an aristocracy.Is Capitalism It?Actually, in spite of the ""free market"" talk, the United States economy is far from a freely operating Capitalist system. Why is this? In the United States, we, as people, have rights. Yes, we have rights, rights that often run contrary to market forces. Unions organized in order to prevent worker exploitation during the industrial revolution; our minimum wage was instituted by Franklin Roosevelt in 1938 as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which also established the 40-hour work week, overtime pay and bans on child labor; and we've created a number of programs, such as unemployment insurance, to soften the blow of hard times on regular people.However, it isn't because of some ""overwhelming moral urge"" that programs, organizations and standards such as these exist. We've learned something that has caused them to persist: the market is flawed. We realized that the more people who do better, the better for all of us. The United States experienced the height of its power and wealth in the years immediately after the Great Depression and World War II when, unsurprisingly, the American middle class was the strongest it's ever been. Even up until 1968, minimum wage workers made today's equivalent of $10 an hour. We can still see evidence of this populist advantage today in Sweden -- a massive welfare state -- where per capita G.D.P. has grown more quickly than in the United States over almost any extended period of time in the last 30 years. They've seen a sharp increase in the amount of college graduates, which has, in turn, stimulated high-skilled job growth.So, what do we do, then? Do we simply tell our workers to fend for themselves? After all, according to John Locke, the purpose of establishing a civil government is to protect the freedom and well being of all members of society. What good does it gain us if our country houses a hundred of the world's most wealthy if our poor cannot eat, by their own hand? We criticize social programs because they ""make people lazy"" but then we still don't want to pay people reasonably for the work they're doing. More so, we can't reasonably expect people to be in the position to take advantage of opportunities to improve their station if they have no power to do so; quite frankly, in today's America, money is power. Not everyone has to be wealthy but everyone should, at least, be able to work hard and know that, if they do that, they'll be able to provide for themselves. Otherwise, the state is nothing more than a cruel master."
3,WOMEN,Debra Messing On The Myth Of The Perfect Woman,Amanda Duberman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/debra-messing-making-it-work_n_5239666.html,,2014-05-01,"NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 11: Actress Debra Messing joins eBay to launch The Give-A-Toy Store opening at Herald Square benefiting Toys for Tots on November 11, 2011 in New York City. (Photo by Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images for eBay)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5f9b525000094003974cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What does it take to get to the top -- without losing your center? Our “Making It Work” series profiles successful, dynamic women who are standouts in their fields, peeling back the ""hows"" of their work and their life, taking away lessons we can all apply to our own.Had Debra Messing never earned her big break, she might be a 45-year-old litigator just two years out of law school. Messing made a promise to her father that if she didn't get at least one paid acting job by the time she was 40, she would throw in the towel and go to law school. She made good on her promise with time to spare. Within months of earning a Masters Degree from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, Messing turned industry heads with her performance in a workshop production of Tony Kushner's play ""Angels in America: Perestroika."" A few years and television gigs later, she became universal best friend Grace Adler in ""Will & Grace."" The role installed Debra Messing as an entertainment fixture. She went on to star in shows like ""The Starter Wife"" and ""Smash,"" just wrapped up the Broadway production of ""Outside Mullinger"" and in the spring she'll play homicide detective Laura Diamond, the title role in NBC's ""The Mysteries Of Laura."" It is Messing's taste for culturally and comedically important roles -- and her ability to make them so memorable -- that allows her to be discerning. And her batting average is pretty solid. Between her three longest running TV roles, Messing has been nominated for six Emmy Awards, eight Golden Globe Awards and eight Screen Actors Guild Awards. Oh, and she won a handful. Since giving birth to her son Roman in 2004, who she lives with in New York, Messing's sharp sense of which projects are worth doing is even more important. Celebrity has not made the demands of working motherhood any easier for Messing, but with killer instincts and ""balance"" as the ultimate goal, her priorities are universal. The Huffington Post had the opportunity to speak with Messing over the phone in connection to her partnership with Zyrtec. The actress opened up to HuffPost Women about earning a living, getting her kid into school, and the few blissful hours of live court TV that make it all a little easier. Why do you do the work that you do?  Because it's my passion. I don't actually think of work as work because it feeds me on so many different levels. As a creative person and as a mother and as a friend, [my work] adds something very specific to my experience. I know that I would be unhappy if it wasn't a part of my life. ""Will & Grace"" aired on NBC from 1998 to 2006What work would you be doing if not this?  If I wasn't an actress, I would be a litigator. In my downtime, for fun, I watch live court TV. Trying to solve mysteries and bringing people to justice is something that has always intrigued me. But I decided years ago I was going to go the actor route route instead of the lawyer route. Although, when I got into graduate school, I promised my father that if I didn't get a paying acting job by the time I was 40, I would go to law school. You've certainly fulfilled that promise! What is your definition of success? My definition of being a success is doing my absolute best to fulfill all of the roles that are important to me in my life. So whether I'm an employee or I'm a mother or a daughter or a friend or a community member; a charity advocate or activist -- those are the things that are important to me that I want to be the best at. But I also recognize that we can't be all things at all times. I am a success when I feel like I have a balance of the things that are important to me. That's why I signed on to work with Zyrtec --- because it's something that helps me be the person that I want to be. It helps me be able to be an active mother and be able to go outside in the Central Park in the pollen vortex. Messing takes a selfie with Mariska Hargitay and Alexandra Wentworth at the 2003 Joyful Heart Foundation GalaHow is the day-to-day reality of being a working mother different from how you may have imagined it?  It's much harder than I anticipated it being -- and I anticipated it being very, very hard. I think one of the biggest challenges is not criticizing myself for not being more of a full-time mom. I never spend enough time with my son. Never. I always want more. But there is the reality that I have to work. Coming to peace with that is the biggest challenge for me. But I think the times when I was not happy or not fulfilled were when I was neglecting certain parts of myself, whether it was neglecting being a great mom or being completely there at work. Again, it's an act of balance. It's a struggle for everybody. Messing and co-star Brian F. O'Byrne close a Broadway production of ""Outside Mullinger"" in JanuaryYour character in ""Mysteries Of Laura"" is described as a homicide detective who isn't as successful in getting her children to behave. What about Laura appealed to you, and what do you think she represents about modern womanhood? I really related to her because she is very passionate about what she does. She takes great pride in being as accomplished as she is. But she's also a loving and devoted mother who is going through a divorce and trying to deal with her private life and wanting everything for her children that she can possibly give them. But of course, life doesn't always happen that way. There are disappointments. Do you relate to her?  In the pilot, Laura is struggling to get her sons into a really good school. I've been there. I moved to New York and I had to get my son into a good school and I can't imagine being more stressed out in my entire life than when I didn't know if he was going to get into a good school. I believe that most working mothers will relate to her. She does what she can. She's resourceful. She has her detective kit and wet ones that she uses not only on her son but on a murderer who has blood on his face.What type of female characters do you like to play?  For me, every project is based on the script and on the writing. If I'm committing that kind of time, I want to feel really emotionally invested in the character I'm playing. I think the thing that has led me to choose roles I have chosen is that they are women who I relate to; who are flawed. I am not interested in watching perfect women, because I don't believe they exist. I want to watch real life.On ""Will & Grace,"" I wanted to make people laugh, but I also liked the social element -- the world in which we were being funny. ""The Starter Wife,"" in a more subtle way, was social commentary. Again, Laura to me is an everywoman. She's trying to do it all on her own and she's trying to be the best at everything she does. You see her failing and succeeding from hour to hour. To me, that's real life. Filming ""Mysteries Of Laura"" in New York CityWhat's one thing you know now that you wish you'd known 20 years ago? I didn't want to do accept the fact that I couldn't be everything to all people. When I was younger, I thought if I worked hard enough, studied hard enough, or was dedicated enough and gifted enough I would be able to be everything to everyone. I think as we get older, you realize it's just not possible.What's one thing you want to see change for women in Hollywood?  I wish that there were equal representation of women in the storytelling. Unfortunately, we're not there yet. I'm hopeful, because I look around and I see this exorbitant pool of talent that is out there. So it's not like [equality] couldn't happen. It's just a matter of the infrastructure opening up and valuing women consumers and artists equally.  Messing accepts an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for ""Will & Grace"" in 2003Do you have a role model?  My role model for my entire life has been Meryl Streep. She went to Vassar and she went onto the Yale School of Drama. She's very educated and took her craft very seriously and then she went on to be one of the most gifted and important female artists of our time and yet, she has a beautiful family and has an extremely normal home life. You never really see her or her family in they tabloids or anything and she has an enduring marriage. She is the person that I have, my entire life, looked at as someone I really admired and respected. What's the best compliment you could receive?  I think I know what my mother would say to this: I think the best compliment I could receive is that I am a kind and generous and genuine person. This interview has been edited and condensed. "
