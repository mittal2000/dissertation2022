GPS For The Soul can help you find your way back to balance. GPS Guides are our way of showing you what has relieved others' stress in the hopes that you will be able to identify solutions that work for you. We all have de-stressing ""secret weapons"" that we pull out in times of tension or anxiety, whether they be photos that relax us or make us smile, songs that bring us back to our heart, quotes or poems that create a feeling of harmony, or meditative exercises that help us find a sense of silence and calm. We encourage you to look at the GPS Guide below, visit our other GPS Guides here, and share with us your own personal tips for finding peace, balance and tranquility.You have the power to de-stress and recreate your life with Positive Choices -- life choices that fuel your body, mind, spirit and heart. We live in a frantic world -- bombarded by more information than we can possibly assimilate, and we are exhausted from a lack of leisure. The Positive Choices program is simple, yet potent. By adding one Positive Choice at a time to your life, you feel happy and in control of your life, once again. To make room for Positive Choices that bring you joy and fulfillment, you must subtract your personal Serenity Stealers -- the negative life choices, like doing work you that drains you of your life force, staying in destructive relationships or ignoring your health. These Serenity Stealers rob you of your peace of mind and zest for living. If you are feeling stressed out, meditating or vacationing, etc. will provide vital temporary relief. But if you have a challenging Serenity Stealer, you need to analyze it and then create strategic solutions. You have three basic choices -- you can start avoiding or eliminating what is causing your stress or you can renegotiate or modify it. Most situations we can subtract or remedy -- really, it’s true. Deep down, you know what disturbs your inner peace and what you need to cast off. For example, if you hate where you live, you can move or feng shui your space so that it feels nurturing, for the moment. You are in charge of your life choices every day, which make up the quality of your life experience. We often “forget” to leverage our available personal power to transform our lives. Below, find some pictures of Positive Choices and inspiring words.

Instead, the next time you notice yourself feeling defensive or like you're a failure or that you're not good enough, practice using a buffer phrase.",2013-04-24,Frustrated young man sitting after having an argument with his wife in bedroom,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d16c826000032007fba4b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"John Gray With Anat Baniel: Tip 3 - How to Win in the Blame GameThis is the third blog post in my interview series with John Gray in support of parents of children with special needs and parents in general. As we discussed in our first and second posts, when your child has special needs, the challenges and stresses to your relationship with your partner grow exponentially. As a parent to a child with special needs, one of the most important skills is learning how to communicate lovingly and effectively with your partner at difficult times, such as when making decisions as to how to best help your child or simply when dealing with the extra challenges of the daily care of your child.When a parent realizes that his/her child has a serious problem, be it ADHD, autism, cerebral palsy, undiagnosed developmental disorders, a genetic disorder or any other problem, first there is the shock, fear and confusion. Often times, in an attempt to make sense of it all, there is a tendency to either blame oneself and feel guilt or blame others. As time progresses, these feelings of stress, frustration, overwhelm, anxiety and fear may persist and even increase. As parents, we start to feel like it's our fault, that we should be able to help solve our child's problems and that something is wrong with us. Then there is the flip side: We may blame our partners. This is called defensiveness. When we are defensive, we have a hard time listening to our partner and taking in what they are telling us. We also tend to become more critical, blaming and attacking. Whether we have a child with special needs or not, when we're under a lot of stress, defensiveness is likely to show up. It's very normal and common, and at the same time, highly desirable to change, because defensiveness can damage a relationship by denying both partners the love and support they so long for and need. The good news is there are other options.Step 1: Recognize when you are defensive. When you find that you're blaming yourself or about to blame your partner, when you feel that it is ALL her/his fault, or you bounce back and forth as to whom you blame, you are being defensive. When you find yourself arguing and excusing your actions or putting your partner in a position where s/he is feeling ""wrong"" or ""bad"" and s/he has to justify her/his actions, you are being defensive.Step 2: Recognize when your partner is being defensive. When your partner is blaming his/herself or you and you feel like you need to defend yourself, realize that your partner is feeling defensive and could use some love and support. Step 3: Do not get sucked in, acknowledge to each other that you are being defensive. The moment that you become aware that you are being defensive, stop the conversation and tell your partner that you just realized you are being defensive, that you are sorry for being blaming and attacking, and either ask for a brief time out to calm yourself down or simply tell your partner that you are backing off from all the blame. If it is your partner that is being defensive, gently acknowledge the great stress of the moment and tell her or him that you feel attacked and ask that s/he change how s/he communicates with you at that the moment. Step 4: Move to gentle and intentional communication -- buffer phrases.  One of the best approaches at times like this is to be gentle with each other when you communicate. It's important to pay attention to the words you are using. Often, when you are defensive, you will come across as criticizing or blaming your partner without intending or even knowing you are doing so. You can learn how to soften what you are saying by adding a few ""buffer phrases."" A buffer phrase sounds like this: I didn't mean to sound so critical. I want to take a moment to let you know what I do appreciate but I also want to share what is going on inside of me.Or, if you are feeling criticized or blamed by your partner, another way to use these buffer phrases is to say something like:Honey, I know you don't mean to sound critical, but it's starting to sound like I don't do anything right. So let's pause for a moment and just tell me the good things I do. Or: That makes sense, but let's take a moment to look at the good things that you and I are doing and then come back to this discussion. After you take a few minutes to talk about the good things you do, then you can respond with: OK, now we can come back to our discussion. It's so easy to take things personally. Instead, the next time you notice yourself feeling defensive, or feeling like you're a failure or that you're not good enough, practice using a buffer phrase. Try to shift to more gentle communication so that you don't end up pushing your partner's buttons. Out of wisdom and love for each other, it is important to soften your communication when you or your partner are feeling defensive. This will make difficult discussions so much easier. Remember, you, too, have special needs and a great need for love and appreciation, and so does your partner. Both of you are facing real challenges that you can handle better as a loving team.WATCH: Recognizing Defensiveness - Learning How to Use ""Buffer Phrases""  to Soften Communication: Tip #3 From John GrayTry using buffer phrases when communicating and see if it makes a difference in your discussions.

Hospitalization. Asphyxiation that can lead to death. No, we're not talking about the symptoms of some  mysterious foodborne illness here, but rather the potential consequences of voluntarily eating some common, and often popular, foods. With these possible side effects widely documented, what is it exactly that causes people to not only include these foods in their diets but to go out of their ways to find them? Let's take a look at some of the most dangerous foods thrill-seekers can't stay away from.Related: The World's 6 Scariest RestaurantsA spoonful of cinnamon Does a spoonful of cinnamon a day keep the doctor away? Not exactly. In fact, you will probably need a doctor on call. A recent article in The Atlantic details how a medical journal looked into the ""cinnamon challenge,"" which essentially involves a person trying to swallow a spoonful of dry cinnamon. The aftermath almost always includes coughing, vomiting and can even lead to collapsed lungs. Yet Pediatrics reports that there are currently some 51,000 videos on YouTube of individuals attempting the challenge. What gives? In this case, we hypothesize that the majority of people actually believe that the challenge is attainable, stemming from a familiarity with the spice, or are simply looking to impress family and friends.Related: 13 Warming Food And Drink Recipes With CinnamonHot chilies The Wall Street Journal wrote last month about the ongoing race to grow the world's hottest pepper. The article focuses on the public's increasing awareness of items such as the habanero and chipotle peppers (one is now a Doritos flavor and the other a fast-food chain, the Journal points out). The piece delves into the competitive nature of consuming ridiculously hot peppers, mentioning recent individuals dethroning each other by eating items measuring 1.464 million Scoville Units (that's the ""standard measure of heat""). To give you an idea of just what we're talking about here, that's over 225 times as hot as your standard jalapeño. Now, there are even restaurants serving dishes that include waiver forms, and some diners end up in hospitals after challenging their spice tolerance. Why? Publicity stunts, fame, livin' on the edge.Related: The Main Spectacle At The NYC Hot Sauce Expo Was (Awesomely) TerrifyingFugu (puffer fish) Widely recognized as the world's most dangerous food, blowfish is often referenced in popular culture (hey there, Charlie's Angels). Each year, there are approximately 35 to 65 victims hospitalized from eating fugu in Japan -- where it has long been considered a delicacy -- with a 6.8 percent fatality rate. The poison, tetrododoxin, is found in the skin, skeleton, ovaries, intestines and liver of the fish, and chefs hoping to serve the dish must go through years of rigorous training just to gain certification allowing them to prepare it. Articles note, however, that some people prefer to eat the fish with juuuuuust a little bit of toxin in it to experience a tingling sensation. We're not even sure where to begin on this one, frankly. The ultimate bragging rights? A strong death wish? Yeah, we give up.Ever attempt the cinnamon challenge? Fan of scorching hot chilies? Planning to travel to Japan to nosh on some puffer fish?

On the campus of the still-in-operation Lutheran Theological Seminary, the brand new (opening July 1, 2013) Seminary Ridge Museum is located within Schmucker Hall, a building that served as both field operations base and hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg. And it has one incredible draw. You can climb to the open-air cupola atop the roof, just as Union General John Buford did on the evening of June 30, 1863 when he saw the campfires of Confederate soldiers nearby, giving the Union Army some warning about their approach. The largest Gettysburg artifact in itself, Schmucker Hall contains the only museum that focuses on the First Day of the Battle, Caring for the Wounded and, because it is situated on the campus of a religious seminary, the role of Faith and Freedom during and following the Civil War. Warning -- some dioramas and images are jarringly gruesome, so use discretion when bringing children. Take a Segway Tour of Gettysburg National Historic Park. There are plenty of ways to ""do"" the Gettysburg Battlefield; in your own car with taped audio-tour or step-on guide, via narrated Park bus, on foot or by bike. But in my opinion, the best way to really understand troop movements, skirmishes and the individual players on a human, sometimes humorous, most times harrowing level is through the wind-on-your-face, out in the elements, ""walking tour in fast forward"" Segway Tour. You'll spend about half an hour getting familiar with this unique device, and that includes a few practice runs inside a pretty tight obstacle course (which in my estimation is more difficult than the real route outside). And then, you're off, with a Segway staff member and your very own licensed Gettysburg Battlefield guide, who narrates as you move along and listen through Bluetooth headset. You stop frequently, can ask questions, and will learn little-known stories about the real heroes of Culp's Hill, the strange journey of General Daniel Sickles leg, and the fact that on the final day of the conflict, during the two hours of Pickett's Charge, 11,000 rounds of cannon-fire generated the loudest sustained sound ever produced (before or since) in the Western Hemisphere which was heard 80 miles away, in Washington, D.C. Shriver House Museum. What happened to the townspeople when 170,000 soldiers came to Gettysburg? Of course tourists visit to see where the battle occurred, but most are oblivious to the fact that Gettysburg was a thriving, crossroads town. The Shriver House looks at the war's effect on one family. A costumed guide will lead you throughout the home, where you'll hear about the young couple who married at 18, sold their farm and bought this place on ""Baltimore Hill"" for $290 in 1860. George Washington Shriver did set up a saloon in the cellar and a bowling alley in the back yard but apparently never opened them for business. (A NY soldier wrote home, ""there was a saloon, but no whiskey to be had."") Volunteering instead to serve in the Union Army when Abe Lincoln called for 75,000 troops, George left his wife, Hattie, to manage the house and their two young children. Their next-door neighbor, Tillie Pierce, kept a detailed diary from which the Shriver story is drawn. I won't give anything away, but suffice it to say that the room-to-room narration has twists and turns and involves Confederate troops, forensic reports and curious artifacts found in the house and walls. It was said that after the battle, with hundreds lying dead and amputated limbs decomposing in the streets, the odor was so horrendous it could be detected in Harrisburg 30 miles away. President Eisenhower National Historic Site. Though a different era, President Dwight Eisenhower was connected to Gettysburg in a couple of ways, and it's worth a few hours to discover his first and only real home.. A few years after graduating from West Point, in 1918, Dwight Eisenhower was given his first command -- a 10,000-men Tank Corps (with no tanks, during the challenging Spanish Flu epidemic) at Camp Colt in the area of Pickett's Charge on the Gettysburg Battlefield. Eisenhower returned to Gettysburg in 1955 with his wife, Mamie, to settle into his first and only house on a 182-acre farm adjacent to the Battlefield. After a brief property orientation, your guide will bring you first into the Eisenhower's formal living room, pointing out some of the many gifts showered upon him during and after his presidency, such as a mother-of-pearl inlay cocktail table from Korea and a rug from the Shaw of Iran. But the most interesting space is the very casual Middle-American style enclosed porch where Dwight and Mamie took their TV dinners to watch I Love Lucy and Gunsmoke. It was in this room that Eisenhower entertained the likes of Winston Churchill, Charles De Gaulle and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to ""take their measure,"" in an atmosphere much more relaxed than at Camp David, just 20 miles away. Stay at the Federal Pointe Inn, Gettysburg. The coolest new lodging in town, with 18 tasteful high-ceiling rooms, Federal Pointe Inn was once Gettysburg's first High School, built in 1896 and just gutted and renovated into boutique-hotel-luxuriousness. Owner Peter Monahan, who has been in the hospitality business for a couple of decades, kept some of the more interesting features, like blackboards, rich wainscoting, and stainless steel banisters in the two-story stairwells that are sure to bring back public school memories. Stay in the former Boys or Girls room -- floodlit second-floor corner rooms with 12 foot ceilings, granite bathroom, and sinfully soft bedding. HERSHEY, PAThe Circular Dining Room, Hotel Hershey. Reopening on April 23, 2013, and rebranded The Circular, the Hershey Hotel's iconic round dining room has been updated to reflect the tastes of today's food-wise traveler. ""People don't spend hours 'fine dining' anymore,"" says Hotel Hershey General Manager, Brian O'Day. ""So we changed the menu to address that."" A hopping O-shaped cocktail and baking station takes up the center of the whitewashed room (no more mural). Gas-light-style lamps illuminate wood furniture made in the USA, accented in various chocolate hues. Gone are ""bartenders"" and in their place inventive ""mixologists"" who use house-made infusions in artful (and delectable) cocktails. Chefs and managers who have been culled from the kitchens of several Four Seasons Hotels are adept at satisfying a cosmopolitan clientele. Sit at the circular bar or by the intact stained glass windows (those didn't change) overlooking the magnificent gardens, and graze on terrific ""Wild Mushroom Wellington,"" Pretzel-Crusted Rock Shrimp -- the PA Dutch version of Popcorn Shrimp and infinitively better -- or go full-tilt for the 18oz ""Prime Cowboy"" steak, big enough for at least two). End, of course, with the Chocolate Fondue for Two."

A hopping O-shaped cocktail and baking station takes up the center of the whitewashed room (no more mural). Gas-light-style lamps illuminate wood furniture made in the USA, accented in various chocolate hues. Gone are ""bartenders"" and in their place inventive ""mixologists"" who use house-made infusions in artful (and delectable) cocktails. Chefs and managers who have been culled from the kitchens of several Four Seasons Hotels are adept at satisfying a cosmopolitan clientele. Sit at the circular bar or by the intact stained glass windows (those didn't change) overlooking the magnificent gardens, and graze on terrific ""Wild Mushroom Wellington,"" Pretzel-Crusted Rock Shrimp -- the PA Dutch version of Popcorn Shrimp and infinitively better -- or go full-tilt for the 18oz ""Prime Cowboy"" steak, big enough for at least two). End, of course, with the Chocolate Fondue for Two."
