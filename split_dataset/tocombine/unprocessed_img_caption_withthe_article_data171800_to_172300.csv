Ph.D., Author, Consultant, Speaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/toys-for-kids_us_5b9c859de4b03a1dcc7f6ad3,"Sometimes it seems that books have lost their appeal to children (and to adults), but this may be simply competition between traditional forms of learning and new electronics that appear compelling.",2012-11-16,Kids playing with plastic blocks - two boys and girl,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c859d1f0000510021409d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What are special considerations when thinking about electronic toys and games?  Sometimes it seems that books have lost their appeal to children (and to adults), but this may be simply competition between traditional forms of learning and new electronics that appear compelling. Children need to read from books, hear stories read aloud and also draw, write creatively and play with many different kinds of products (paper, clay, art supplies, puzzles, blocks, dolls, soft toys like puppets, musical instruments, etc.) for optimal learning and for their own enjoyment. Electronic toys, regardless of how many ""bells and whistles"" they have, should not ever replace the essential experience of reading a book, enjoying a story read aloud or playing with real toys, playthings and other objects and creating with one's hands, whether it's finger painting or building a tower of blocks. Too often, electronics take over and grab our full attention, and adults and children forget to interact with a real person, take time out to play or take the time for a real conversation. I do think electronics are excellent ""tools"" for rapid exchanges, making plans, quickly sending information and even playing good games for brief periods of time. Balance is essential and is often overlooked.But, electronics and high-tech toys cannot replace much-needed personal contact, real human interaction and real ""in the moment"" playtime. A good example of this is playing a ""cooperative"" board game and having fun together as a family in contrast to playing alone on a computer, using an electronic game device or only playing games where there are winners and losers. Social interaction is what is most valuable for full human development and optimal well-being.What are some different types of toys?Select toys that offer a good balance and enrich children's skills and creative opportunities. Include products that offer open-ended play like blocks; physical play like balls; silly toys like a jack-in-the-box for its fun and surprise responses; and, of course, electronics that are in balance with non-tech toys.Activity toys develop coordination, improve small and large motor skills and balance. Begin with balls and bean bags; add a tricycle, bike, wagon or skates. A jump rope and a kite are great for outdoor fun. Always check whether your child is ready for the activity. Also, don't forget the valuable experiences of gardening, nature walks, and exploring outdoors. Creativity toys stimulate self-expression. The child can create with crayons, finger-paints, watercolors, clay and craft sets. Children learn from following directions and a sequence of activities and gain satisfaction in completing a project. Don't forget activities like making something new with a cardboard box to stimulate imagination, singing or listening to or making music or trying other creative projects.Learning toys contribute to the acquisition of knowledge. These toys include books, tapes, videos, software, CDs, puzzles and board games. The child should read books, listen to music, solve puzzles and play games. Take time to read a story or create a puppet show. Discuss programs watched on TV or a recent movie attended. Don't forget that there is a lot of learning that goes on when you build together with blocks and varied construction toys, play board games and solve puzzles.When a child has a preference for particular kinds of toys, is that something to encourage or should parents try to get their child to expand? It's best to expose children to many alternatives so that they can appreciate many styles while forming their own preferences. Older children have a wide range of interests. They continue to enjoy play, but they are able to handle more complexity -- in games, projects, products and activities. You will learn a lot if you listen to what children like and why. You may not agree, but understand their preferences as a sign of their own personality growth and emerging peer relationships that are exceedingly important as they mature.© 2012 Stevanne Auerbach, Ph.D. Dr. Toy"
1,DIVORCE,Can Communication Technology Help Postdivorce Coparenting?,"Robert Hughes, Jr., Contributor
Professor of Human Development, University of Illinois at Urba...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/can-communication-technol_us_5b9c7757e4b03a1dcc7ee7ac,"One of the major challenges divorce parents face is how to communicate effectively post-split, without major arguments",2012-11-15,An attractive young woman deciding staring at the fruit and vegetables in front of her,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c7757240000510094afe7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the major challenges divorce parents face is how to communicate effectively post-split, without major arguments. Self-help guides and divorced parenting programs regularly include strategies and suggestions about how to maintain a cordial working relationship with a former spouse. Why? Because one of the most consistent findings about what facilitates children's adjustment post-divorce is the degree to which former partners limit conflict. So it is not surprising that scientists have begun to examine whether new electronic communication tools can be a help or hindrance to parents working out their post-divorce relationships. Early work by Aimee Miller suggests that in some cases, e-mail may help faciilate post-divorce communication, but no one has taken an in-depth look at all of the available communication tools until now. A team of scientists at the University of Missouri led by Lawrence Ganong and Marilyn Coleman studied a group of 49 parents (mostly mothers) after their divorce to determine how divorced parents use communication technologies to manage their coparenting. This qualitative study involved 60 to 90 minute interviews followed by detailed coding methods to extract common themes. In general, the parents interviewed for this study reported a wide range of ratings about the quality of their post-divorce relationship. Some parents reported a very positive relationship with their ex and others reported a very negative relationship. The study's findings indicate that communication technologies can be used in both helpful and harmful ways. Parents with good relationships used communication technologies such as online calendars, email reminders and others to keep their former spouse informed about activities and routines. On the other hand, parents with poor relationships did not report that technology tools improve co-parenting. For these parents, technology was used as a controlling strategy to limit the information the other parent had or to try to influence their reactions to events. In some cases, cell phones were used five or more times per day; parents on the receiving end of the calls viewed this contact as harassment or troublesome and often sought to limit the contact. There were a few cases in which technology was used to limit conflict. In these cases, e-mail could be used to reduce the volatility of the conversations. E-mail often gives parents the chance to edit their comments to reduce the hostility in the communication. The researchers reported that one parent was ordered by the judge to only communicate via e-mail or text in order to reduce the amount of conflict. The authors conclude that ""communication technologies... make boundary maintenance both easier and more challenging. They are unequivocally neither boon nor bane to divorced co-parents."" For the most part, it seems that the technology tools matter relatively little. Parents who are trying to work on co-parenting can use these tools to enhance their communication and parenting skills. On the other hand, parents who are having difficulty co-parenting together after divorce may use these tools to harass, control and mislead the other parent. The big challenge that remains for divorced parents is not what technology to use to communicate, but how to find a way to work together to raise their children."

Stores are making a big push to lure in bargain-hungry shoppers before the Friday after Thanksgiving, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season.

Black Friday sale prices at Walmart, Target and Best Buy increased from 2011 to 2012, according to a study conducted by NerdWallet. Analyzing advertising circulars from the three retailers, NerdWallet discovered that the median item price at all three stores increased since last Thanksgiving. At Best Buy, for example, the average 2011 Black Friday item sold for $29.99 whereas in 2012 the average price rose to $35.00.The uptick in sale prices is in line with the overall increase in consumer prices seen in the past year--up 2.2 percent. Also, don’t be alarmed if you get a bit of deja vu looking through this year's ads. NerdWallet found that 90 percent of 2012 Black Friday ads from retailers like Staples and Ikea listed the same price in a 2011 Black Friday ad. For example, in 2011 a North Face fleece sold for $99.99 on Black Friday at Dick’s Sporting Goods, in 2012 the same fleece carries the identical price tag. Retailers are anxious to get shoppers through the door and spending as soon as possible. Walmart and Target will begin their Black Friday sales on Thanksgiving night and Sears is starting sales as early as Nov. 18. "

Not that there's anything wrong with day-old bagels -- they make excellent doorstops -- but I always wondered what would happen if OWS took all their energy and applied it towards specific, practical goals.We have our answer, and it's amazing: Occupy Sandy has led the way in hurricane relief,  href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/nyregion/where-fema-fell-short-occupy-sandy-was-there.html?pagewanted=all"">bringing much-needed relief to our neighbors in need.Now the movement is getting even more ambitious with something called the Rolling Jubilee. (The Rolling Jubilee is a campaign run by Strike Debt, an outgrowth of OWS. Occupy is kinda like the Wu-Tang Clan: There are so many splinter groups, side projects, and solo albums it can be hard to keep up. But bear with me.)The concept of jubilee -- a forgiveness of debts -- is ancient. Strike Debt is simply updating it for the 21st century.The Rolling Jubilee has one simple purpose: To buy distressed debt for pennies on the dollar and then abolish it. As a test run, we spent $500, which bought $14,000 of distressed debt. We then ERASED THAT DEBT.You see, if you're a debt broker, once you own someone's debt you can do whatever you want with it -- traditionally, you hound debtors to their grave trying to collect, using intimidation, misinformation, and a charming practice called  href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/nyregion/31debt.html "">""sewer services.""We're playing a different game. A more awesome game. Because we're all in this together, and why should banks have all the fun?Our focus is medical debt, an onerous burden that prevents millions of our friends and neighbors from being productive, happy and healthy. (In 2010, nearly one-quarter of all working-age American adults had medical debt; it's involved in 62 percent of bankruptcies.)The Rolling Jubilee kicks off tonight with a live telethon called The People's Bailout. It's a three-hour show you can watch for free at http://rollingjubilee.org starting at 8PM EST. Performers include Janeane Garofalo, Jeff Mangum from Neutral Milk Hotel, Lizz Winstead, members of TV on the Radio, Das Racist, the Music Tapes, magicians, jugglers, a gospel choir, a mariachi band, a group of radical nuns and experts from the exciting world of debt. Did I mention the jugglers?As word has spread about the People's Bailout, we've been humbled and moved by the outpouring of support: Our original fundraising goal was $50,000 -- enough money to abolish $1,000,000 in medical debt. As I write this, we've already raised more than $180,000, and we haven't had the telethon yet! (If we raise enough money to abolish $5 million of debt, Donald Trump's head will explode. Please give.)Some people have complained that our debt-buying is just a drop in the bucket. That's true, and it's by design: One of our goals is to start a national conversation about how crappy the bucket is.Think about it: We live in the richest country on earth -- yet people's financial stability can be decimated if they get cancer and exceed their insurance coverage; decide to go to college without the help of Mitt Romney's parents; or happen to live in an area that's visited by disaster. Meanwhile, other people literally profit off these misfortunes.Not to put too fine a point on it, but the system is rigged: Banks write off their irresponsible loans, preying on consumers they knew couldn't pay them back because that's where they make the most money; debt brokers bundle portfolios, slice and dice them, and resell them without considering what's really in them; collectors scare people into paying debts that might not even stand up in court. How is this conducive to national well-being?Of course, the political right talks about debt all the time: the deficit, the fiscal cliff, etc. They say we're broke because we spend too much on things like public libraries and Social Security and large yellow birds on PBS. Strike Debt believes this is exactly wrong. We're in debt, as individuals, because of a lack of services -- because we have to pay out the nose for education and healthcare while wages have stagnated and safety nets are shredded.If Washington lacks the political will to address these issues and kick a little ass, we'll do it ourselves. Our message to Americans is simple: You are not a loan. And you are not alone.I hope you'll join us for the People's Bailout.Questions?
