The news is of significance to everyone for reasons described in this article. Lucifer, the crown jewel of the Anderson Collection, moved to Stanford with a retinue of 120 colorful accomplices he's befriended while living at the Andersons' residence. The whole gang is now happily installed in a custom-designed museum on the Stanford campus. With room to spread and a loving staff, they now have the means to receive visitors daily. You should visit. Besides bedazzling art, you'll undoubtedly be touched by the friendliness of the museum. The Andersons' gentle and generous spirit permeates, making visitors feel at ease.A Transformative Art ExperienceFifty years ago on a trip to Paris, Harry W. Anderson and Mary Margaret Anderson - known as Hunk and Moo - experienced an ""art moment"" visiting the Louvre. They were not knowledgeable about art then, but felt the pull of art's wonder. Shortly thereafter they made the decision to become knowledgeable and ardent collectors of modern art. They sought to educate themselves, and forged personal relationships with scholars, curators and artists. They filled their home with masterpieces, welcoming each as a new family member. Living with art is a joy only collectors can appreciate. ""When you get to live with art, everyday it changes"", says Moo Anderson.Fast-forward 50 years, they've collected one of the world's most outstanding private assemblies of modern and contemporary American art. The wherewithal came from a flourishing business venture (Saga Corporation). The motivation, an enduring love for art. They chose to focus on American artists who shaped the future. When collecting they had two questions: ""Have I seen it before? Could I have thought of it?"" Collecting art took them on an exhilarating journey to the new, and stretched their hearts and minds in ways it would not have been possible otherwise.The Gift of InspirationToday they've donated 121 ""irreplaceable"" artworks to Stanford University, who built a standalone museum for the collection. ""It became bigger than a family"", says Hunk Anderson, ""it needed to be shared with the world"". Another awe-inspiring fact about the Andersons is that they considered themselves custodians and not owners of the art in their collection. Hunk Anderson described their gift as ""a gift that keeps giving"". There is beauty and generosity in this dedication. May it offer many the joy of having an ""art moment"".The Anderson Collection is special for many reasons. The collection is deeply personal. It was assembled by a family, not a museum curator or art consultant. It represents the personal choices and tastes of a family, and a love relationship that spanned over 50 years. They cherished every artwork equally as a family member. In fact, they grew so close to the art they lived with that when it moved to Stanford, they described feeling as if they were sending their children to college.Museum Makes Art FriendlyA special museum was needed for this collection. Stanford hired Richard Olcott of Ennead Architects, whose firm designed Stanford Bing Concert Hall. The architects took their inspiration from the Andersons' home - a classic postwar California ranch house comprised of a series of interconnected rooms. ""We sought to reflect the intimacy and informality with which the Andersons lived with art"", shared Olcott.From the exterior, the Anderson looks like another beautiful building on campus, blending courteously with its neighbors without haughtiness. I like that the fact that the outer-shell is understated, projecting a sense of humility and deference to the art it encloses. Once inside though, one is in for a treat. And a treat it is indeed! Slow stairs take visitors to the second floor where the art resides. There is no art on the stair walls. ""It gives visitors a chance to cleanse their mind"", explains Olcott. As we walk up the stairs, an oversized and inviting Clyfford Still pulls our eyes up, giving the ascent an aura of mystery. Once at the top of the stairs, there are no signs telling visitors where to start. ""There is no pre-determined path for viewing the installation"", says the Director Jason Linetzky, ""we sought to offer a more casual experience, one which reflects the way the Anderson family lived with these works at home. Here visitors have the opportunity to wander wherever their eyes pull them"". One also notes the absence of doors and closed rooms. It is one big gallery space fragmented by floating walls, creating a multitude of interconnected alcoves.The west end of the gallery where the Rothko and Pollock resides is a must see. Watching those masterpieces cozily facing one another as if engaged in a dialogue is worth the experience in itself. Surrounding them are works by Kline, Gottlieb, and Motherwell. All keeping in good company. I particularly love the smaller alcoves along the stairwell. Art looks so cozy in them. I felt a sense ease and belonging. Each room evokes a different atmosphere, some are meditative, others are lively and joyful. I love the cross-fertilization of paintings, sculptures, and colors throughout the museum. It creates a striking patchwork of colors and unexpected juxtapositions.If the Anderson Collection represents a milestone in Stanford history, it also is a gift to humanity. Connoisseurs will be touched by its charm. If you are intimidated by art museums, this one will make you feel at ease. The rooms are living-room size not museum size, giving one a feeling of what it is to live with art. Museums are usually places for art to be seen. This museum feels like a place for art to live in. A lady sitting on a bench next to me summed it well: ""You know it's a great museum when it makes you talk to strangers about paintings"". I concurred. We exchanged emails. To be continued."

Sad. And mentally exhausted. So I did what I always do whenever I need to process: pray.”Dale’s story is not unusual. Life does not stand still for young people during their college years -- family, relationships, health and countless other “real world” issues arise in their lives to compound the ever-present pressures of academic success.

At the time she was also struggling to maintain a prayer routine and decided to tackle both issues in one.“The discipline required to pray is the type of discipline needed to study daily, so I endeavored to review one biology lecture after every prayer,” Salama said. “Praying helped balance out the stress and negative emotions I felt about the class and helped me overcome the mental block coloring my prior failure.”Prayer and meditation are often happen within community, and students often look for campus groups for support and to help them develop and express their faith. “Religious and spiritual clubs on campus are sources of solace, support and solidarity that help students navigate through their undergraduate years,” Varun Soni, the Dean of Religious Life at the University of Southern California, told HuffPost.

It encourages me to step back and recognize that despite all my worldly concerns -- including succeeding academically, preparing for a future career, and working -- there is a greater power that I turn to for support.” <em>  The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) released a report in 2007 on “Religious Engagement Among American Undergraduates.” Among the findings was a suggestion that religious students are <a href=""http://religion.ssrc.org/reguide/index6.html"" target=""_hplink"" role=""link"" class="" js-entry-link cet-external-link"" data-vars-item-name=""less likely to participate in drugs"" data-vars-item-type=""text"" data-vars-unit-name=""5e987b59e4b021bb4121c094"" data-vars-unit-type=""buzz_body"" data-vars-target-content-id=""http://religion.ssrc.org/reguide/index6.html"" data-vars-target-content-type=""url"" data-vars-type=""web_external_link"" data-vars-subunit-name=""article_body"" data-vars-subunit-type=""component"" data-vars-position-in-subunit=""2"">less likely to participate in drugs</a>, drinking and partying -- which in itself might induce stress for students at a time when social groups are of upmost importance. Harley Skorpenske, a third year zoology student at Ohio State University who converted to the Baha’i faith when she was fifteen, follows strict religious requirements but derives confidence from her faith to be who she is without fearing social repercussions.  As Dean of Religious Life, Soni’s job often makes him privy to students’ innermost dilemmas of faith and identity. “Many of my conversations with students begin as discussions about school and work, but they quickly move in an existential direction,” Soni told HuffPost. <span style=""font-size:20px; float: right; width: 300px; margin: 20px;"">""I felt empowered in that safe space to share my faith with others.""</span> “There are a number of resources on campus that help students figure out <em>how</em> to secure graduate school admission or a job,"" Soni said. ""A unique contribution from an Office of Religious Life is to challenge students as to <em>why</em> they want to go to graduate school or work in a particular field.” For Ze’ev Lowenberg, a senior at West Virginia University, his desired career path stems from a deep identification with his religion. “I am constantly in the Hillel and Jewish state of mind,” Lowenberg told HuffPost. “It is the most essential part of who I am, and it follows me everywhere.” Lowenberg is a senior cadet in the ROTC and is applying to Rabbinical School to be a rabbi in the Air Force. He has experienced not only the stress of school but also the pressures of high-intensity field training for the Armed Forces. “Being spiritual and being grounded in my faith helps push me through the most trying times,” Lowenberg said. “I am a true believer in ‘Everything happens for a reason,’ and that helps me get back up after being knocked down.” College students may find themselves “knocked down” in various ways throughout their education, but for Harley Skorpenske that became a literal reality one day.  When she was 16 years old Skorpenske was diagnosed with systemic lupus, which made college a difficult prospect, she said. One particularly cold January day during her freshman year, Skorpenske fell down while walking between classes. She went to sit on a heater inside the building and watched as her joints filled with fluid. “I had every intention to call my mom that night and tell her I was done. I was convinced that my body was not strong enough to finish this. Before I went home, I went to the weekly Baha’i devotional. We talked about the faith’s emphasis on education and went over selected writings. Over the next week I reflected on this devotional and decided to push on. I am now going into my third year here and am very pleased with that decision.”  </em>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e987b592500008d216b7e7b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Brandon Dale was approaching the end of his sophomore year of college when he received distressing news.

3,FIFTY,Why Men Are Moodier Than Women -- Especially As They Age,"Carol E Wyer, ContributorBlogger and award-winning author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moodiness_b_5898654.html,"Last week was what I would call a 'grumpy old week'. The media has been full of articles about curing grumpiness, how cats are grumpy and how the menopause along with mood swings associated with it, will soon be a thing of the past. I buzzed from radio station to radio station, giving my opinion on the grumpy story of the day. Then one story threw me: Are Women Moodier than Men?",2014-10-07,"At A Certain Point In A Relationship, Sex No Longer Matters",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559d8f051b000013018591f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale," Last week was what I would call a 'grumpy old week'. The media has been full of articles about curing grumpiness, how cats are grumpy and how the menopause along with mood swings associated with it, will soon be a thing of the past. I buzzed from radio station to radio station, giving my opinion on the grumpy story of the day. Then one story threw me: Are Women Moodier than Men?The newspapers reported that women spend 10 days a year in a bad mood. Reasons for this include bad weather, husbands who don't listen, friend's social media updates, feeling fat and broken finger nails. There were a number of other triggers including feeling undervalued, struggling to stay on top of household chores and a quarter of the thousand women surveyed said their partner was at the root of their bad mood.Only 10 days? That can't be right. I manage more than 10 days a year. Women have much to be grumpy about, especially as they get older. There are far more concerns, health problems and hormone sways that will lead to swings in mood. Surely, the researchers meant 10 days a month?According to the study on behalf of Healthspan, one in two women confessed they were moody 'a lot' while four in ten women said their temper worsened as they aged. Well, I would agree with that. I have become less tolerant as I have got older and if I have had a lousy night's sleep then I am more likely to be in a grump. However, on further reflection, I concluded that women are not moodier than men. Both sexes are susceptible to being in a bad mood from time to time, with the scales skewed for women as female hormones have a big impact on their moods. Yet, in my humble opinion, and based on research I have carried out the last few years, men are moodier than women, especially as they age. Before you all start yelling at this post and calling me sexist, let me clarify that statement. Men are considered to be moodier because when they are grumpy about something they act differently to women. They are likely to become withdrawn, snappy and their bad mood lasts quite a while whereas a woman can be drawn out of her bad humor. How many of us have asked our man, ""Are you okay?"" only to have him give us an icy stare and snarl, ""I'm fine.""The problem then is often exacerbated by the woman who persists in asking what is wrong. Men are often moody because of the same reasons women are moody. They may have work pressures or there may be other factors associated with aging. He may just have had a frustrating day. It is best to leave him to come round although sometimes that can be a while.If a woman is feeling grouchy she can usually improve her mood by chatting to friends, having a massage, retail therapy or even just having 'me' time. Most women surveyed agreed that having time to themselves improved their mood. Other solutions were to exercise, eat chocolate and drink wine. A man is less likely to talk about his concerns and fume quietly while his other half wonders what is bothering him. All the women I questioned agreed their spouse remained in a grumpy mood much longer than they themselves would. When the husbands were questioned about this, they all agreed that wives or partners attempting to cajole them out of their mood or ask what was wrong made them moodier.Grumpiness affects us all, men, women, young and old. Are women moodier than men? I don't think they are. I believe both sexes can be grumpy but women are better at handling bad moods. I'm sure there are plenty who will disagree with me so. What do you think? Are women moodier than men?Earlier on Huff/Post50:"
4,HEALTHY LIVING,Is Your Health Care on a Spiritual Path?,"Ingrid Peschke, ContributorBlogger, 'Changing Tides of Health'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-your-health-care-on-a-_b_5863824.html,,2014-10-07,2014-09-22-BoardwalkthroughGrassbyWaterformatted.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-22-BoardwalkthroughGrassbyWaterformatted-thumb.jpg,"For many, health care is no longer just about caring for their body. People are waking up to what they can do to contribute to their health on a mental level. That often means considering the healthy impact of their spiritual practice, whether that involves regular visits to the temple, the mosque, a meditation room, or church. There's now plenty of research to support these findings.This mindful vs. physical approach is perhaps born out of disillusionment with what has been America's more mainstream approach to health care. That is, according to several documentary films gaining notoriety, one recently nominated for an Emmy award and several others that are about to be released.This year's news and documentary film Emmy nominee, Escape Fire: The Fight To Rescue American Health Care, shows how our health-care system is more of a disease-care system with an over-dependence on drugs and surgeries designed to keep a person in the system alive, but not usually well enough to live a healthy life without medical support.Yet another film, Fed Up, takes a cold hard look at our food supply in the United States, which consists of 80% packaged and processed foods. The film uncovers a food industry that is ""in the business to make money, not to keep America healthy."" Sugar is the new drug, hidden in the majority of foods on grocery store shelves and keeping customers coming back for more. Katie Couric, who provides commentary throughout the film, says, ""Over 95% of all Americans will be overweight or obese in two decades."" And LA Weekly's Amy Nicholson says, ""Fed Up is poised to be the Inconvenient Truth of the health movement.""And that's where a variety of approaches to health nimbly enter the scene. Of course, sound nutrition practices, as well as regular exercise seem the obvious first solutions. But these are still practices based on a physical approach to health. A quiet, strong voice for the decidedly mental nature of health has also stepped up to the plate. But not for the first time.Mary Baker Eddy, a 19th century visionary on health who introduced a way to care for one's health based entirely on a spiritual practice, had this to say: ""The elements and functions of the physical body and of the physical world will change as mortal mind changes its beliefs. What is now considered the best condition for organic and functional health in the human body may no longer be found indispensable to health. Moral conditions will be found always harmonious and health-giving"" (Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures).People are recognizing that they can do all the right things physically and yet still not be entirely healthy. Does this have something to do with what Eddy refers to as ""changing beliefs""? Margarine used to be the new butter. Now experts say to eat the real thing. And what about diet drinks? Sugar substitutes, like saccharine, went out of vogue and now natural sugar is still preferred (in moderation) by nutritionists. Is our health only as stable as the latest fluctuating theory?Eddy described her system of Mind-healing--a reliance on a distinct divine Mind vs. the human mind--as having both a practical pharmacy and medicine: ""Its pharmacy is moral, and its medicine is intellectual and spiritual, though used for physical healing"" (Science and Health).What is for sure is that physical solutions and outcomes will forever fluctuate and change, whereas ""moral conditions"" such as expressing compassion, peace, honesty, forgiveness, etc. remain the same. These health-giving, spiritual qualities are innate to each one of us.Dare I suggest the benefits of living a life of inspiration and prayer and loving yourself and others has staying power that surpasses even the currently perceived benefits of kale smoothies or a few hours on the yoga mat?"
5,POLITICS,Joni Ernst Position Misrepresented,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joni-ernst-ads_n_5947496.html,,2014-10-07,"UNITED STATES - AUGUST 08: Joni Ernst, Iowa Republican Senate candidate, campaigns at the 2014 Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa, August 8, 2014. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d8b32400003200577398.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org.Democratic TV ads in Iowa have repeatedly misrepresented Republican Joni Ernst’s position on Social Security, claiming she “would privatize Social Security” or that she has “proposed privatizing Social Security.” But Ernst hasn’t proposed or endorsed any plan to change Social Security.At most, Ernst has said that she would consider allowing “younger workers,” or those “just entering the workforce,” to put some portion of their Social Security payroll taxes into interest-bearing or stock market-based “personal savings accounts” for their retirement. And, despite ad images that suggest otherwise, Ernst opposes any changes in Social Security for current seniors or workers nearing retirement age.Ernst is facing Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley in a tight race to fill the seat of retiring Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin. Back when she was competing for the GOP nomination, Ernst let it be known that she would at least be willing to “look” at changing the way Social Security works for “younger workers.”During an Iowa Press primary debate in April, Ernst said: “I think we have to keep the promises that have been made to our seniors but we do have to change the way we do business with our younger workers or those that are just entering the workforce. And I agree, we do have to look at some sort of a personal savings account.”She again said that she would explore transitioning “younger workers” to “individual savings accounts” during a KCCI News 8 primary debate in May:Ernst, May 29: I do think we have to keep the promises that are made to today’s seniors, absolutely. So to do this, we do have to reform Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. And the way we do that with Social Security is by looking at transitioning our younger workers onto individual plans or individual savings accounts, whether that’s tied to the market, whether it’s based on interest rates — however we want to do that, we can have that discussion. But the way we are protecting our seniors is by transitioning our younger workers. And we can do that, but we have to keep our promises to seniors.Democrats have hammered Ernst for wanting to “privatize Social Security” ever since. And the ads attacking Ernst on the issue appear to be working, as 56 percent of likely voters see her position on Social Security as “a problem,” according to a Des Moines Register poll taken between Sept. 21 and Sept. 24.The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee aired a TV ad in August called “Team,” saying that Ernst “would privatize Social Security.” But that goes too far.Ernst hasn’t advocated for a completely privatized program, and she certainly hasn’t talked about making changes for seniors currently collecting benefits or those nearing retirement, such as the white-haired man featured in the DSCC’s ad.Ernst has only talked about allowing private accounts for younger Americans as just one possible way to make sure that the Social Security program is around for future generations.‘As An Option’In fact, in its ad titled “Talked,” which aired through much of September, the DSCC shows a clip of Ernst saying, “Yes, I have talked about privatizing Social Security,” editing out the next three words, “as an option.” Here is what Ernst actually said at a seniors event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sept. 3:Ernst, Sept. 3: Yes, I have talked about privatizing Social Security as an option. Again, that is one solution. So what I recommend is that we look at a number of solutions because we really don’t know which way is the best way to go yet. But if we do take Social Security and privatize that, if that would be decided that that is the solution, it needs to be so that there is a protection in place for our seniors so that they are not losing the benefits that they have. Again, if we’ve made promises, we need to keep those promises.She went on to say: “It is a solution to privatize. Is it the solution? We don’t know that yet. We really have to look into it.”The ad also links Ernst to billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, co-owners of Koch Industries, who the ad says “spent millions trying to privatize Social Security” and “millions more trying to elect Joni Ernst.” The ad cites a Feb. 12, 2012, “Need to Know” document from Americans for Prosperity, a conservative issue advocacy group founded by David Koch, that also talked about “personal savings accounts for Social Security.”According to the document, “instead of seeing their hard-earned dollars funneled through Washington to pay for current retirees’ benefits, workers would truly own and control the accumulated funds and could invest them with a wide variety of investment funds offering different mixes of stocks and bonds and different levels of risk and reward.”But AFP’s suggested plan wouldn’t totally privatize Social Security, either. It was a voluntary plan that allowed workers to choose to invest with private accounts or avoid the risk and stick with traditional Social Security.A Proposal from Ernst?Ernst hasn’t actually outlined a concrete plan to “privatize Social Security” at all.In July, the DSCC ran an ad called “Stand,” which claimed that Ernst “proposed privatizing Social Security, gambling our savings in the stock market” that “experts say that could be a windfall for Wall Street.” But besides saying that “personal savings accounts” for “young workers” should be considered, Ernst hasn’t offered many specifics.How much of their Social Security taxes would those “younger workers” be able to put into those private savings accounts? All of it, like in Chile, which has a truly privatized system? Just a minor percentage of tax contributions, perhaps one-third, like President George W. Bush and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan proposed in years past? Would it be a mandatory or voluntary program? Would the accounts be managed by the government or by private companies? Would the accounts be invested in the stock market, U.S. Treasury bonds or something else?We don’t know the answers to those questions because Ernst hasn’t said, and we didn’t hear back from her campaign when we reached out to ask for more details.The Social Security page of Ernst’s campaign website only quotes her as saying, “I believe that we must first and foremost protect the promises made to our seniors, like my own mom and dad, and those middle class parents who are already paying into the system on their own pathway toward retirement. But we need real solutions for those young workers about to enter the workforce in order to ensure this safety net is there for future generations that include my own daughter and grandchildren.”The ad’s reference to a “windfall for Wall Street,” refers to a 2004 NBC News article that said “President Bush’s plan to partly privatize Social Security could be a windfall for Wall Street, generating billions of dollars in management fees for brokerages and mutual fund companies.” However, in March 2005, we found that “the type of private Social Security accounts being proposed by President Bush would yield very little profit to the securities industry, contrary to persistent claims of a potentially huge ‘windfall’ to Wall Street.” And Ernst hasn’t said whether she would back a similar plan or not.Yes, Ernst has talked about possibly having private Social Security accounts for younger workers, but only as something that should be on the table for consideration. She hasn’t committed to a fully “privatized” Social Security system, or even a partial one, as some Democratic TV ads would have viewers believe. That is a point that Ernst made in her first televised debate with Braley on Sept. 28, when she said, “I haven’t endorsed one option over another, but we need to come together in a bipartisan manner to solve these issues.”In fact, the only thing that Ernst has committed to is keeping the “sacred promises” made to “today’s seniors” collecting Social Security benefits."

Yet things are still far from normal. Castle is now forced to find a balance between the the mystery of his own disappearance and the weekly murder case. The CaseThe body of Wallace Williger, a toy-company CEO, is discovered by a group of rowers wrapped in plastic in the East River. The team happens upon random clues that seem to lead nowhere: a burner phone, a supposed mistress (who was actually just a makeup artist teaching Williger how to age himself), a dog inside a secretly rented apartment and the fact that Williger worked as a janitor in his own company disguised as an old man. The undercover-boss case makes no sense to Beckett, until she discovers the dog in the apartment is actually a drug-sniffing dog. The team then figures out that Williger was investigating a drug smuggling operation that was happening under his nose. When he finds out that heroine was being smuggled into the U.S. inside his company’s ""Sunshine Sarah"" dolls he is murdered by his assistant, Matt Monroe, who was the leader of the operation. What happened to Castle?""Montreal"" does a good job of balancing the light tone we’ve come to expect from Castle with the new darker mystery of his disappearance. After being ambushed by a reporter on TV, Castle decides to offer a reward for any information about where he’s been the last two months. This, of course, produces an array of false tips and crazy calls including a man who insists he was with Castle… on a spaceship. Just as he’s about to give up hope a young newlywed couple gives him his first clue. While reviewing their honeymoon pictures they realized Castle was in the background of one of them, talking to none other than Fake Henry Jenkins, from the season 7 premiere. The couple then informs Castle that the photo was taken in Montreal. They figure out the picture was taken in front of a bank and Castle, after getting permission from Beckett, promptly hops on a plane with Alexis. Here is where one of the three mysteries from Lanie’s examination in ""Driven"" is cleared up. It turns out that the key with the number 38 engraved on it belongs to a security deposit box in the bank in Montreal. Castle and Alexis discover three envelopes inside the box; one addressed to Kate, one to Alexis and one to Martha, all in Castle’s handwriting. All of them have a memory card inside.Back in the precinct, Castle tells Kate what he discovered and shows her the video on the memory card. The screen lights up and we see Castle saying goodbye and telling Kate that he didn’t want to leave her and that he loves her “always.”Tech-guru Tory is able to find some clues in the video and runs a program that locates where it was filmed. Unfortunately she steps out of the room before the program finishes running and Castle runs off to Montreal, alone. Once in the room where Castle shot the video he is faced with Fake Henry Jenkings holding a gun on him. His shocking revelations leave Castle doubting if he should keep looking into his disappearance. According to Fake Jenkins, Castle asked to forget everything. “Some mysteries aren’t meant to be solved,” he says. “It’s over now.” When Castle has trouble believing he’d ask to have his memory wiped, Fake Jenkins brings up the story of an 11-year-old Rick and what he saw in Hollander’s Woods, “The real reason you became a mystery writer.”Castle’s shock matches our own as we realize this is the first time we might actually get a glimpse into why Castle does what he does. Castle says he’s never told anyone about that incident and realizes that if he told Fake Jenkins there might be some truth to the impostor’s tale. Will they wed?Back home we get to see Castle and Kate in bed, talking about their next move, still trying to figure out how to be together again. Castle wants to get married right away but Kate insists they need time, a month, to get back to their old selves. “A month,” Castle ponders, “It’s a date.”Seems like the wedding bells just might be ringing in November. Worth Noting:-Lanie and Espo are back together! Apparently Castle's disappearance made them realize life is too short to be apart.-Castle's scenes in the toy factory were amazing, from stepping on the giant piano to accidentally shooting the assistant. It gave us some time with his inner child, who's always hilarious.-CASTLE KISSING GATES. Enough said, this was probably the best scene in the whole episode. -The sneaky bank manager in Montreal was clearly lying about not knowing Castle. -Still no kiss from Caskett, we get that the relationship is going through tough times guys, but really? The dog interruption was not funny.Quote of the week: Castle on going to Montreal to find out what happened to him: “It’s Canada, how risky can it be?!”""Castle"" airs on Mondays at 10:00 p.m. EDT on ABC."

Fresh air strikes by the US-led coalition hit positions held by Islamic State jihadists in the southwest of the key Syrian border town of Ain al-Arab (Kobane), according to an AFP journalist just across the border in Turkey. The strikes came a day after the extremists pushed into Kobane, seizing three districts in the city's east after fierce street battles with its Kurdish defenders. AFP PHOTO/OZAN KOSE (Photo credit should read OZAN KOSE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13e64230000330093dd53.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISTANBUL -- Kobani, a Kurdish town in northern Syria just a stone’s throw from the Turkish border, wasn't widely known until recently. But now, with the Islamic State poised to overthrow the besieged town, Kobani has become a rallying point for all Kurds.Members of Turkey's Kurdish minority are alleging that the Turkish government is tacitly supporting the Islamic State, the militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL. This week, tensions reached a boiling point as pro-Kurdish demonstrators took to the streets to protest the government's inaction in the face of the possible fall of Kobani.As of Tuesday evening, at least nine people had been killed in demonstrations protesting the Islamic State and the Turkish government, Reuters reported. The protests, organized in part by the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party, occurred across Turkey and in several international cities on Monday and Tuesday. Turkey imposed a curfew in five provinces on Tuesday, including Diyarbakir, the country's largest Kurdish city.For decades, a bloody conflict has raged between Turkey and its Kurdish minority, whose demands over the years have included self-rule, basic rights and greater freedoms. In 1984, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) -- which the United States has designated a terrorist organization -- announced a Kurdish uprising against the Turkish state. Since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed in Turkey as a result of the conflict.In March 2013, the group’s jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan called for a cease-fire. As PKK militants withdrew to the Iraqi mountains and the beginnings of a peace process emerged, the conflict seemed to have reached a turning point. But after a period of relative peace, Kurdish anger against the Turkish state has exploded once again. More than 180,000 Syrian Kurds have fled from Kobani to Turkey in the past three weeks. Now, from the relative safety of Turkey -- interrupted by the occasional Islamic State mortar shell that lands close to or within Turkish territory -- they watch as dark plumes rise from their city. On Monday and Tuesday, there were a handful of coalition airstrikes on Islamic State positions, strikes that Kurds in Kobani said came late, but helped them to hold back the militants' advance. Meanwhile, Turkish tanks lined up along the border haven’t budged an inch. There have been repeated reports of desperate Syrian Kurds waiting at the border for days before being allowed to cross into Turkey. Turkish Kurds headed to Kobani to defend the city from the Islamic State have been turned away by Turkish border guards. And Kurds protesting in solidarity with Kobani's residents have been met with tear gas by Turkish authorities.At the same time, Turkey faces increasing criticism that it is turning a blind eye to extremist fighters who frequently cross Turkey’s porous border with Syria and recruit new fighters in Turkish cities. Many foreign fighters seeking to join the Islamic State fly into Istanbul. Turkey, for its part, is worried about the Kurds becoming too powerful. “Turkey is concerned about the creation of an independent, or even autonomous Kurdish region in Syria,” Aaron Stein, a Turkey expert and an associate fellow at London’s Royal United Services Institute, told The WorldPost.In particular, Turkey is gravely concerned that the People's Defence Units, the Syrian Kurdish fighting force that now controls Kobani, might gain more power. The People's Defence Units is linked with the PKK, which Turkey considers a terrorist organization.The protesters' anger at the Turkish government over Kobani is echoed at the highest levels of the PKK. Ocalan, who has been imprisoned since 1999, warned last week that negotiations between Turkey and the PKK would end if Kobani fell to the Islamic State. “I am calling on those in Turkey who don’t want to see the process collapse to shoulder responsibility,” he said in a statement. “The reality of Kobani and the peace process are not separable.”Officials stress that Turkey is doing everything in its power to help Kobani -- a claim met with skepticism from Kurds as the Islamic State hoists its black flags on the edges of the town.“We will do do whatever we can so that Kobani does not fall,” Turkey’s Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu recently said. But his statement came with a caveat. “If Kobani falls,” he said, “Turkey is not at fault. If Kobani falls, this shouldn't be tied to the solution process.”Late last week, Turkey’s parliament voted to give the government the authority to take military action in Iraq and Syria. The vote also gave the government the ability to allow foreign countries to use Turkey as a base for attacks against the Islamic State. But while the vote has gotten much attention, this is the third year Turkey has voted to theoretically authorize a military intervention without actually undertaking one.As Tuesday came to a close, it didn’t look like military action would be happening anytime soon. Hugh Pope, the International Crisis Group’s deputy program director for Europe and Central Asia, said Turkey was unlikely to use its new war powers. “Turkey has made it clear that it is not about to invade Syria, and indeed, there are many reasons why it won't,” Pope told The WorldPost. “Military capacity, legal obstacles, domestic political sensitivities, the possibility of Syrian retaliation and NATO obligations, to name just some of them.""

Those two young women with their Confederate flag and Southern pride had to travel all the way to Bryn Mawr to learn that history.",2014-10-07,"Rebel/Dixie flag, the one that started all the controversy a few years back.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae518f2100003100c6d25b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Callous or merely callow?That's the question that has roiled the otherwise idyllic campus of Bryn Mawr College recently. Apparently two students tacked up a Confederate flag in the hallway next to their dorm rooms and controversy ensued.After the uproar the two students apologized, issuing an email that read in part, ""Our intention was never to cause the pain the community is currently suffering."" They went on: ""We apologize for hanging an object seen as a symbol of hate for many and for the subsequent divide and suffering of the Bryn Mawr community."" One of the young women is from Texas and the other from Georgia, and their intention, so they said, was simply to demonstrate their Southern pride.I make no claim to know the sincerity of that apology, but I'm inclined to take the students at their word. I believe that they probably were unaware that the Confederate flag was, and remains, the symbol of a failed nation created for the purpose of perpetuating (and expanding) slavery. I'm voting callow, not callous.There is certainly a kind of racism at work here, but I suspect not the kind that offended other Bryn Mawr women. It isn't about the racial views of two individuals, I suspect, but rather the racism of collective memory. These two women merely echoed a central piece of Southern mythology: The Confederacy, the Civil War it started, and the flag that flew over the losing side of it wasn't really about slavery. The myth has been around for nearly 150 years -- it started roughly a week after Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox -- and it has rooted deeply in the national imagination.Let's be clear: Abraham Lincoln did not prosecute the war to end slavery, at least not initially. But Southerners started it to protect their ""peculiar institution."" Texans, for example, were quite sure that ending slavery would be a disaster for their state and for the South as a whole. They seceded from the Union in 1861 because they believed ""that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding States.""After the war was over, Southerners worked furiously to re-write the purpose and meaning of it. Not an act of rebellion against the legitimately elected government of the United States, not an insurrection designed to protect slavery from the advance of freedom, the Confederacy morphed instead into a glorious ""lost cause"" fought for vaporous abstractions like ""Southern honor"" and political fatuities like ""states rights.""In this way, the memory of the Civil War was scrubbed clean of slavery and scrubbed clean too of the 4 million slaves the South fought so desperately to keep in bondage. Refusing to confront its own history, white Southerners invented a ""heritage"" for themselves instead. Thus did it become possible to wave the Stars and Bars at NASCAR events without any shame at all.Perhaps we should not be astonished that two women educated in Southern states -- and educated well enough, apparently, to gain entrance to one of the nation's elite liberal arts colleges -- could in 2014 have failed to learn about Southern history and still be waving the flag of the glorious lost cause. After all, in 2010 Virginia governor Bob McDonnell announced the creation of a ""Confederate History Month"" which made no mention of slavery at all. And in 2011, the cream of Charleston, South Carolina, society celebrated the 150th anniversary of secession by dressing up in their antebellum finest and throwing a fancy plantation ball. Makes you wonder what students in Texas and Georgia actually learn about each state's commitment to slavery.Southerners love their ""heritage"" because it has enabled many of them not to confront their history. Those two young women with their Confederate flag and Southern pride had to travel all the way to Bryn Mawr to learn that history.Steven Conn teaches history at Ohio State.

Lavery did not return a request for comment last week, but said when the lawsuit was filed last year that Tommy's ""shed"" was a state-of-the-art $150,000 facility, and that the chimp had been on a waiting list for a primate sanctuary for three years.An appeals court in Rochester in December will hear a similar case from Wise involving a chimp named Kiko. State judges dismissed both cases but allowed Wise to create the record necessary for an appeal.Wise is using a legal mechanism traditionally filed on behalf of people, usually prison inmates, who claim they have been unlawfully imprisoned.Although there are hundreds of captive chimps in the United States, Wise said he thought Tommy and Kiko would make compelling subjects because they lived alone in conditions he said were clearly unfit for a chimp.The bid to secure legal rights for animals has been criticized by some prominent legal experts, including U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner and New York University law professor Richard Epstein.If animals gain rights once reserved for humans, courts would be inundated with tricky legal questions that could spawn a series of novel and potentially contradictory rulings, they say.

The advance of Islamic State radicals and the death and destruction they left in their wake had Christians flee Mosul and surrounding Nineveh Province, an area of relative peace and quiet for religious minorities. They had already fled Baghdad and other cities in Central and Southern Iraq in years past. Some Christians stay in Kurdish controlled areas and hope for better times, but most have left for Jordan, Sweden, the United States. In those places, far away from their roots, they cling on to languages and traditions dating back to the first churches in the first century, AD.Most of us have at least heard something about the fate of Iraq's Christians. Or of those in captivity due to blasphemy laws in Pakistan, such as Asia Bibi. But who has heard of the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Burma, atheists in Saudi Arabia or Hindus in Bangladesh? Pew Forum, a U.S. think tank, concludes in a report in January this year that no less than three quarters of the world's population lives in countries with high or very high restrictions on religion, with this proportion trending upwards.This is shocking. For the vast majority of world population faith is a core part of identity. The hundreds of millions who do not have a state- or society-sanctioned religion or belief live in a state of permanent prison of the heart and mind. This is happening in the age of information, where ideas are supposed to flow freely around the world. It is time to get more serious about fighting religious persecution.Doing more begins with finding the political will to use the many tools already at our disposal. Some countries, particularly in Europe, also need to shake of a reluctance to intervene in cases of religious persecution. Such interventions do not automatically mean 'us versus them', or 'Christians defending Christians.' On the contrary, a track-record of even-handedness will greatly increase credibility across cultural and religious divides.To begin with, freedom of religion or belief is recognized as a universal human right by all major international human rights conventions. The International Criminal Court should do more to prosecute systemic or widespread religious persecution as a crime against humanity. The fine print of trade agreements and development partnerships nearly always contains a human rights conditionality clause. State parties to these agreements should use the agreements and the financial and political levers they provide as tools for improvement of the right to freedom of religion.Leading donors should spend a larger share of their funds on the fight against religious persecution. This is money well spent as religious freedom encompasses several other rights, such as the freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. Governments should also be more willing to grant asylum to those persecuted for their faith. Some new and potentially useful tools have been developed recently. In 2009 France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs set up a 'religions unit' (pôle Religions) in its research department. This was done after the realization that knowing more about global trends in religions may provide extremely valuable information about past, current and future conflicts, but also about opportunities for reconciliation. More countries should follow this example.Last year, the European Union issued guidelines for its diplomats on freedom of religion or belief. The guidelines contain many good ideas about how to recognize (coming) persecution. However, for the implementation of the various steps of sanctions as described in the guidelines the EU will have to find more political will then what's currently in stock.One thing the EU guidelines overlooked is the role of religious leaders. Policymakers should engage, rather than eschew, religious leaders. They may be the problem in a number of countries, but they may also hold the key to solutions. Encouraging them to preach tolerance and making clear that hate speech is not acceptable may help to restored respect for religious freedom.Finally, for some in the West attitudes may have to change as well. A more rigorous approach to religious freedom is only credible if internal and external policies are coherent. Bans on minarets or on wearing religious symbols are unhelpful and in fact classified as restrictions on freedom of religion by Pew Forum and others. Faith can be extremely powerful. In a world where religion is often used to hurt and break down, let's try and channel this power to heal and build up."

Television cameras showed Katie Castan in the stands holding up this sign:The Royals went on to win the game in comeback fashion. So the question became: is Katie getting her puppy? A week later, her boyfriend fulfilled what the sign promised. Katie and her boyfriend Joe Onofrio adopted a 4-year-old Pembroke Welsh Corgi and named her Lucy, the Kansas City Star reported on Tuesday.

Fully 80 percent are at least somewhat concerned, up from 69 percent in the previous poll. Other surveys confirm rising worry about the disease.Experts say an outbreak in the U.S. is ""extraordinarily unlikely"" -- a message that seems to have largely gotten across. Despite concerns, a 56 percent majority of Americans say they're confident there won't be a large outbreak of Ebola in the U.S.. That number is down from about two-thirds in August.People are less worried when they're asked to speculate about their personal health as opposed to abstract questions about the spread of the disease. In a separate Pew Research poll released this week, about one-third said they were concerned that they or someone in their family would be exposed to Ebola. That falls at or several percentage points below the level of public concern during other disease scares in the past two decades, including swine flu in 2009, staph in 2007, bird flu in 2005, and SARS in 2003.The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Oct. 1 to Oct. 3 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.
