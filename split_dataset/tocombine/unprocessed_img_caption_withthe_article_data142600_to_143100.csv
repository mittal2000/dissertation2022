The lights are going out for Peter Parker, the high school student bitten by a radioactive spider whose wall-crawling and web-slinging antics have made him a touchstone of Marvel Comics' universe of heroes and villains. The publisher said that Parker's alter ego, Spider-Man, will finally succumb to one of his most pernicious foes in the final issue due out Wednesday. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1b4282200003401db6515.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Education needs more radioactive spiders.Stay with me.Consider Peter Parker. His childhood wasn't easy. Both his parents, Richard and Mary, were killed on a mission as double agents. Raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May in Queens, Peter spent most of his childhood without an identity.Now, Peter was a good student. He had a real knack for chemistry, mathematics, mechanics, biology, physics, and photography. But he lacked confidence, drive, and self-belief. He was bullied constantly by the other students. He was lonely, shy, and socially isolated.One day in high school, he attended a science exhibition about radiology. In a moment, something happened that forever transformed him.He got bitten by a radioactive spider.This changed everything. He suddenly realized he had all these powers. He was much stronger and quicker than he ever realized. He could climb walls effortlessly. He discovered he had finely tuned sense perceptions. He even used his extensive science knowledge to design a special kind of ""liquid cement"" that could shoot out of a ""web-shooter.""With his newly discovered abilities, he immediately went for fame. But it went to his head, and when placed in a position to catch a thief, he did nothing. Later, he found out that the same thief had killed his Uncle Ben. If he'd done something earlier, his Uncle Ben would have survived. He realized that with great power comes great responsibility.But in this moment he also realized something else: For the first time in his life, he had an identity. Who was he? He was Spider-Man.* * * * *Now more than ever, education needs more radioactive spiders -- figuratively, of course. What we need is for more teachers to show students just how much possibility resides within them, and to then provide them with a safe space to find their identity.Unfortunately, every single day, extraordinarily talented and creative individuals sit in our classrooms bored out of their minds. What we must realize is that potential is not enough. Potential needs a catalyst, a reason for expression.Positive expectations matter. So many kids with a specific learning disability (e.g., dyslexia, autism, ADHD) -- who have areas of strengths and weaknesses -- are labeled ""learning-disabled."" They are fed a steady stream of negative expectations on a daily basis, and this has a major impact on their performance.Elisha Babad found that the expectations that teachers bring to the classroom have systematic effects on their grading and also affect their students' performances on standardized tests. Kathleen Cotton found that teachers with lower expectations of their students offered fewer opportunities for their students to learn new material, gave insincere praise (which the students were quick to pick up on), provided less stimulating and lower-level cognitive questions, and gave less effective but time-consuming instructional methods.Children are very sensitive to the overt and covert signals they are receiving from their friends and teachers. While teachers may try hard to suppress their low expectations, they still display a fair amount of communication ""leakage."" Jan Pieter Van Oudenhoven and Frans Siero found that even though teachers gave students thought to be learning-disabled twice as much overt verbal praise, they simultaneously gave more negative nonverbal feedback, such as exhibiting discouraging head movements.This expectation leakage has serious effects on brain development. Kenneth Kishida and his colleagues had people take an IQ test alone as a measure of their baseline level of ability. Then they gave the participants another IQ test in a small group setting. Importantly, after each test item, they were given feedback on their performance ranking within the group. While everyone performed worse in the group setting, those who suffered the most were those who were told they were ""low performers."" Not only did these folks perform significantly worse than their baseline level of performance, but they also showed brain changes in areas associated with fear and working memory (the amygdala, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the nucleus acumbens). These results suggest that the lowered expectations brought about anxiety, which prevented them from showing their true colors. Low expectations literally shut down their brain.* * * * *What about the other end of the spectrum: those with high ability? Well, they too can be heavily impacted by expectations. Like Peter Parker, there are so many children with an incredible knack for something -- whether it's science, math, writing, photography, art, music, dance, theater, etc. -- who fall between the cracks. So many of these children don't flourish because it is expected that they will automatically do everything brilliantly just because they have a knack for something. Unfortunately, there is often little effort to help students with high ability figure out how their rapidly developing abilities fit in with their simultaneously developing self.Consider a study by Jennifer Fredricks and colleagues, in which they conducted in-depth interviews with gifted and talented adolescents. Their gifted sample consisted of students aged 17 to 21 who were identified as gifted by their elementary school and were also in the top 25 percent of GPA. These college students were asked to recall their high school experiences in gifted education. In contrast, the talented sample included students in grades 9, 10, and 12 who were perceived (by themselves and by parents and teachers) as being highly competent in at least one nonacademic activity, who valued engagement in that activity, and who spent considerable time in the activity after school. Nonacademic domains included sports, instrumental music, vocal music, drama, and dance.The researchers found striking differences in the responses between the two groups. The students in the talented sample reported a great love for their domain, a strong sense of identity, more frequent flow experiences, and the desire to engage in their domain all the time. In contrast, the gifted sample didn't appear to be nearly as wrapped up in academics as much as the talented adolescents were in sports and the arts. Many of the students in the gifted sample were depressed and had a bleak vision of their future.The researchers speculate that there was more passion for nonacademic domains because individuals' need for challenges, autonomy, competence, and relatedness were more likely to be met in athletics and the arts than in academic domains. Youth in the talent sample talked more about having opportunities to make choices, receiving public recognition for their ability, and being supported and encouraged by teachers and peers. Tellingly, the researchers found that when students in the gifted sample were given greater freedom of course selection, they reported greater enthusiasm.This study highlights the fact that passion isn't an automatic consequence of performing well on an IQ test or getting good grades in school. Passion is activated by a clear set of conditions, and these rules apply to everyone; no one is immune. We're all human, with fundamental needs, even if we may differ in our level of development in any one slice in time.* * * * *Those who are often the most vulnerable to having an identity crisis are those with advanced ability in some area who also have a specific learning disability. On the one hand, these students are constantly being told that their identity is ""learning-disabled."" On the other hand, they know they are capable of amazing things. This creates conflict and confusion at a crucial time in their adolescent development, when they are in the throes of figuring out who they are and just how they would like to contribute to this world.I personally witnessed the power of the radioactive spider. Prior to ninth grade, I had no identity other than ""learning-disabled."" I was placed in special education very young due to an auditory processing disability that constantly left me one step behind the rest of the kids in the classroom. Despite coming home and writing elaborate fantasy stories, or acting out soap opera plots in my head, it never dawned on me that any of that counted as smart or creative.Until I got bit.One day in ninth grade, a special education teacher who I had never seen before came into the special education classroom. She looked past my label and saw my boredom and frustration. But most importantly, she saw possibility.Taking me outside the classroom, she asked why I was still in special education and why I wasn't taking more challenging courses. This seemingly simple question snapped me out of my ordinary state of awareness. Everything suddenly clicked as I realized I had no good answer to her question. I suddenly realized that I was holding myself back.From there, I signed up for everything I possibly could sign up for. I tried out various identities, from Latin scholar to actor to opera singer to cellist. Some things didn't click. But some did. Slowly but surely, with a new-found belief in my abilities, I found my identity. As a result, I went from a C or D student to a straight-A student. The grades naturally followed from my new-found identity.I wonder how many children we judge too soon. I wonder how many we write off as ""stupid"" or ""slow"" when all it would take is a radioactive spider bite to show us all what they are really capable of achieving. I also wonder how many high-ability children fall between the cracks because of bullying by classmates, or because of the messages they receive from teachers that indicate that high ability is all they need and that identity, purpose, and perseverance don't matter.Unfortunately, in this standardized testing culture, the teachers who inspire and enable others to see what's uniquely inside them are about as rare as radioactive spiders. But hopefully someday I can change my analogy, because there will be so many teachers transforming students that they will become an entirely common species.I'm convinced that there is so much more possibility in all students than we realize. Imagine what would happen if educators helped all students see in themselves what is possible, and then helped them integrate that into the core of their identity?I bet we'd have a lot more superheroes.© 2013 Scott Barry Kaufman, all rights reserved.Acknowledgements: Thanks to Rachel Ruiz at BOOST Collaborative for inspiring this post, and to Amanda Stern for encouraging me to pursue it.Disclaimer: Portions of this post were taken from my new book, Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined.This post originally appeared on ScientificAmerican.com."

Russian police arrested dozens of people on Saturday after clashes erupted in the city of Saint Petersburg between pro- and anti-gay demonstrators.

I went continent by continent. When I hit Europe, astute readers noted that the further east one went, the more hateful the countries got. From sunnily dispositioned Spain and Belgium, things got cold in the old Warsaw Pact countries, and downright Ice Agey in the former Soviet Union. It goes without saying that Russia has since gone from the Ice Age to deep freeze, and as a luxury gay travel organizer, my advice is simple:Do.Not.Go.It case you've been living under a particularly heavy rock, Russian President Vladimir Putin (who is very quickly becoming a convincing stunt double for Josef Stalin) pushed through what is formally called Article 6.21 of the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses. For all practical purposes, it outlaws talking positively about homosexuality and is a backslide of historic proportions. In the end, what it proves is that Russia, which has always tried to prove itself a respected power in the eyes of Europe and the West, has once again only really just cornered the market on despotism. Again.PolicyMic.com has an excellent summary of the law. The following is an excerpt taken from author Innokenty Grekov's analysis of the statute: Propaganda is the act of distributing information among minors that 1) is aimed at the creating nontraditional sexual attitudes, 2) makes nontraditional sexual relations attractive, 3) equates the social value of traditional and nontraditional sexual relations, or 4) creates an interest in nontraditional sexual relations. If you thought the wording was a little vague, Grekov agrees. Because the law is spelled out so broadly as to what counts as ""propaganda,"" literally anything that's even the remotest positive or even neutral reference to homosexuality is suspect. It could be two women holding hands as much as it could be a debate on the relationship between Alexander the Great and Hephaestion. Paintings of Jupiter abducting Ganymede could be seen as corrupting.And don't think for a second that foreigners are exempt. No matter whether you agree with it or not, a visitor is always subject to the laws of the country he or she is in, be it Russia or the United States. To prove the point, Russian authorities already incarcerated three Dutch tourists in the Arctic city of Murmansk who were making a documentary on LGBTQ rights in Russia. They found out quick, needless to say.Of course, this has castigated Russia by press both inside and out. I mean, my God, even National Geographic got in on the act, throwing up a list of the most deadly countries in the world for gays and lesbians -- and when was the last time you heard of that magazine jumping on the political bandwagon? I just got it for the pictures.The really sad part about this is that Russia is a beautiful country. After the roller coaster ride it went through after the U.S.S.R. collapsed, the world was discovering its charms all over again. St. Petersburg was built from the first brick to be a spectacular city, and indeed, it is. Lake Baikal is a natural wonder. The holy city of Vladimir is a true hidden gem. But then Russia decided to yank Ukraine back into its orbit by starving it of fuel, and then it invaded the country of Georgia, and then it supported Assad's psychotic regime in Syria. And we're supposed to line up for the Olympics/World Cup/Miss Universe? Fuck, no. Don't go there, don't spend your money there, and don't give them the time. Personally, I would love to see delegations unfurl the rainbow flag during the Parade of Nations and have Anderson Cooper report it bare-chested while wearing a pair of strap-on angel wings, but let's face it: Neither is likely to happen. So don't go. Slovakia and Bulgaria, while by no means gay paradises, are still havens compared with Russia and provide Slavic vacations with the best of them. And when in comes to the Olympics -- and I'll bet it is this that becomes a PR nightmare for Putin and his myrmidons (and proves the last thing Russia has is ""respect"") -- here is a tip: If you want thrilling sports action that is LGBTQ-friendly, try Cleveland, Ohio. That city throws the Gay Games next year, and as a traveler, may I say that the city the natives call ""CLE"" (see-el-ee) is a hell of a lot friendlier than Sochi."
4,QUEER VOICES,The Fast-Changing World Map of LGBT Rights: A Talk With the UN's Charles Radcliffe,"Nish Gera, Contributor
Writer, Filmmaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbt-rights-un-charles-radcliffe_us_5bafbafde4b0ad769260f8d5,"Charles talks about the big strides that countries around the world have made on this issue in the last decade, the present-day LGBT rights map of the world, which still looks like a ""patchwork quilt,"" and where he thinks we will (and can) be a decade from now.",2013-09-21,2013-09-18-DelegatesrequestspeakingslotsatLGBTdebate.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-18-DelegatesrequestspeakingslotsatLGBTdebate.JPG,"Singer and actor Ricky Martin and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (photo credit: UN/Rick Bajomas)The UN recently launched an unprecedented global campaign to support LGBT equality in an event in Cape Town. Called ""Free and Equal,"" the campaign aims to change attitudes across the globe using the power of social media, creative content and celebrity ambassadors. The celebrities already backing the campaign include Ricky Martin, South African singer and ""Princess of Africa"" Yvonne Chaka Chaka, Bollywood actress Celina Jaitly, and Brazilian hit maker Daniela Mercury.Championing this campaign and fueling the rapidly increasing momentum at the UN for LGBT rights is Charles Radcliffe, the head of the global issues section at the UN human rights office in New York.In this interview Charles talks about the big strides that countries around the world have made on this issue in the last decade, the present-day LGBT rights map of the world, which still looks like a ""patchwork quilt,"" and where he thinks we will (and can) be a decade from now. What we see in the media about the UN's involvement in the issue is only part of the story. Charles talks about how ""behind-the-scenes diplomacy"" -- private meetings with governments in New York, Geneva and elsewhere -- is creating pressure for legislative reform. It has been a rocky road, but the results are evident: The number of countries to come out against LGBT rights violations has grown from 32 to 85 in a span of just over five years!Nish Gera: It seems that LGBT rights are a relatively recent focus for the UN. Tell us about how the shift happened and when.Charles Radcliffe: The public debate is new, but concerns about violence and discrimination against LGBT people have been filtering through the UN human rights system for many years. Since the year 2000, allegations of human rights abuses against LGBT people began to be cited with increasing frequency by UN human rights rapporteurs. More recently, the Human Rights Council's peer review process has provided another platform for complaints to be aired. The voices of LGBT activists -- empowered and connected as never before thanks to the Internet and social media -- have also made themselves heard at the UN, including at many informal meetings organized by supportive states.In 2010, the issue was given a boost when Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his human rights chief Navi Pillay appealed publicly for the worldwide decriminalization of homosexuality and other reforms to protect the rights of LGBT people. Their leadership is helping to bring the issue into much sharper focus at the UN, both in public settings and in private meetings.But perhaps the most crucial factor has been a shift in the underlying balance of opinion among states. As recently as 2005, only 32 countries were willing to sign onto a statement at the UN expressing concern at LGBT rights violations. That number grew rapidly, to 54 in 2006, 67 in 2008 and 85 in 2011. I cannot think of any issue on which opinion among states has moved so quickly and so dramatically. That last headcount in 2011 arguably marked a tipping point, the moment when, for the first time, more countries than not wanted to see action taken. Once we were there, the way was clear for the Human Rights Council to take up the issue. In mid-2011, the Council adopted the first UN resolution. It expressed grave concern at violence and discrimination against LGBT people and set in train an exploratory process of reporting and debate. Delegates request the floor during the Human Rights Council's panel discussion on discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation (photo credit: UN/Violaine Martin)Gera: We often hear a lot about the progress on LGBT rights in the U.S. and Western Europe through the media. How does the map on LGBT rights look for the rest of the world? Radcliffe: It's a patchwork quilt, as it is on almost any human rights issue. It's true that the trends in the U.S. and Western Europe are largely positive, in terms of changes in both the legal framework and social attitudes. But other regions have also progressed. Latin America has seen enormous improvements, with new anti-discrimination measures, anti-homophobia campaigns and marriage equality in two countries (Argentina and Uruguay). The new law on gender identity in Argentina is a model for the rest of the world. There are some signs of progress in Asia too. Nepal, Pakistan and India all issue third-gender identity cards, albeit with varying conditions attached. Thailand is debating civil partnerships for same-sex couples. A debate on gay rights is unfolding in India after the courts struck down a colonial-era provision that penalized same-sex relationships. Even in Africa, which has generated more than its share of bad news for LGBT people, there are glimmers of hope. South Africa, in spite of high levels of homophobic violence, remains a beacon in the region, with strong constitutional and legal protections. Elsewhere, as a new generation of leaders emerges, there is tentative talk in several countries of reviewing criminal laws and rethinking attitudes. If you look beneath the surface in Africa, even in places where politicians and the media are most hostile, you find a rising activism on the part of the LGBT community and its allies, joined in some places by national human rights commissions.Of course, there are bleak spots: In a third of the world's countries, homosexuality is still criminalized; in seven countries, the death penalty may be applied. Draft laws in Uganda, Nigeria and Liberia would strengthen existing penalties for homosexuality and ban LGBT organizations from operating. In parts of Eastern Europe, activists are prevented from holding marches or organizing public gatherings. But dividing the world between good pupils and bad is an oversimplification. In the end, all countries are embarked on the same journey on this issue -- albeit traveling at different speeds and facing their own obstacles along the way. Change, when it comes, can unfold quickly. Fifty years ago, gay relationships were still criminalized in much of Europe. Twenty-five years ago, the Thatcher government in Britain banned schools from stocking books that contained information on same-sex relationships. Look at how far things have changed for the better since then!All countries need to do more. There are gaping holes in anti-discrimination laws. In more than half of U.S. states, for example, employers can still fire workers for being gay and face no legal consequences. Many transgender people in Europe are forced to undergo sterilization if they want their gender identity to be officially recognized. Homophobic bullying of children and violent hate crimes are a problem everywhere.Gera: More specifically, where and how has positive change happened in the last 10 years?Radcliffe: Few would have predicted it 10 years ago, but the big story in many Western and some Latin American countries has been marriage equality. It's a cause that has struck a chord, especially among younger people, gay and straight alike. It has also helped to present gay and lesbian people in a new light: Everyone can relate to the human need for love and mutual commitment. But the marriage equality movement is culturally specific, not global. In many parts of the world, LGBT activists will tell you they are fighting for other things: a lifting of criminal sanctions, better access to health care, an end to workplace discrimination and, above all, public education to encourage people to rethink their attitudes and treat LGBT people with the respect they deserve. And if you step back and look for trends from the past 10 years, it is in these areas that you find some of the most significant changes.LGBT pride parade in Moldova with UN monitors present (photo credit: OHCHR/Claude Cahn)Gera: Tell us about some of the recent successes for the UN on LGBT rights. Radcliffe: The most visible change at the UN is that everyone is now talking about LGBT rights. Senior UN figures, from the secretary-general down, are shaping the debate -- condemning violence and discrimination and pressing states to accelerate reforms. In the space of a year, we had the first UN resolution, the first official UN report and the first formal UN debate on the issue.A lot also happens out of sight. The UN is increasingly active in raising LGBT-related human rights concerns in private meetings with governments -- in New York, Geneva and in the field. This kind of behind-the-scenes diplomacy can yield real results, both in individual cases (securing the release of jailed activists, for example) and in helping to generate pressure for legislative reforms. It also helps to ""normalize"" the issue: Rights violations affecting LGBT people are gradually becoming a routine subject for the UN's human rights institutions, approached in the same way as rights violations against other minorities. Gera: What do you consider as limitations on what the UN can and cannot achieve on this issue?Radcliffe: One of the most powerful instruments available to the UN is international human rights law. The commitments that governments make when they ratify human rights treaties are legally binding. The challenge is enforcement: The UN cannot make countries do what they don't want to do. There are no special forces at the secretary-general's command that he can send in to require a government to decriminalize same-sex relationships or oblige a parliament to amend anti-discrimination laws to protect LGBT people. Often the best we can do is to document abuses, voice concerns -- sometimes privately, if that is the best way to be heard, sometimes publicly -- and urge countries to take corrective action when they veer away from international human rights standards. We can also stand in solidarity with activists on the ground. Sometimes it helps if hostile states know that local LGBT human rights defenders have the UN at their side.Gera: Given how accelerated the pace of progress is today, what is your vision for 10 years down the road? How will it feel to be gay or trans in 2023? Radcliffe: Social change is speeding up in part thanks to social media, which is bringing hundreds of millions of people into contact with human rights activism in ways that could hardly have been imagined a decade ago. It is a trend that will only be reinforced further in the coming years.We talked before about the patchwork world map. Another way to look at it is an expanding safety zone -- whole swaths of territory where life is getting to variable degrees better for LGBT people. Over the next 10 years I am confident we will see this safety zone expand, encompassing an ever larger area. Inside it, LGBT people will enjoy greater protection and social acceptance. The big question is: What about those outside it? Countries cannot wall themselves off from change. Progress will eventually reach all parts. But as we move forward, expect setbacks; it is a familiar pattern. The backlash is already evident in Russia, parts of Africa and Eastern Europe, where politicians are proposing draconian new restrictions and painting LGBT people as a threat to children and society. But backlashes rarely last long. Gandhi put it best when he said, ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.""Free & Equal is an initiative of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, implemented in partnership with the Purpose Foundation, a leader in building global, social media-driven campaigns on human rights-related issues.

Federal judge Kimba Wood officiated at the non-denominational wedding, which was attended by members of the couple's families, including the groom's five children, a source familiar with the wedding told Reuters on Saturday.For Soros, whose net worth is $20 billion according to Forbes, this will be his third marriage. It is Bolton's second.Soros put a Graff wedding band on Bolton's finger during the half-hour ceremony, according to the source.The exchange of vows will be followed by a reception, which begins at 4:30 p.m, with more than 500 guests at the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, the Westchester County complex known for its Italian Renaissance-inspired buildings and lush gardens.Among the guests at the various events are World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and some foreign leaders, including Hendrik Toomas Ilves, president of Estonia; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia; and Edi Rama, prime minister of Albania.Also expected to attend are fellow titans of the hedge fund world, Paul Tudor Jones and Julian Robertson. From the U.S. political realm those invited include Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, both Democrats.On Friday night, the couple held a reception for 300 guests at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan for a preview of the new exhibition of works by Belgian painter Rene Magritte - ""Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938.""The honeymoon plans were not immediately disclosed.Soros, who established one of the first hedge funds in 1969 and is probably best known for famously betting against the British pound in 1992, met Bolton at a dinner party in 2008. Their engagement was announced in August 2012.Bolton, who was raised in California, is the daughter of a nurse and a retired naval officer.

That's a shame, because the scientific discoveries emerging from NASA these days are as exciting as any Hollywood blockbuster. Whether it's the stunning images from the Mars Curiosity rover, or the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes' observations of a dazzling array of exoplanets, or the announcement that Voyager 1 has become the first human-made object to leave the solar system, NASA is daily generating storylines that provoke the imagination and expand our horizons. What makes these developments intriguing for adaptation into sci-fi movies is that they are real. At a time when audiences are increasingly jaded by computer special effects, there's something fresh and engaging about a sci-fi movie that might actually have some basis in reality. Isn't it time that we see more sci-fi films that explore the real mysteries of the universe all around us? As a case study for a sci-fi movie inspired by NASA science, I recommend that people take a look at Sebastian Cordero's Europa Report. With a cast that includes Sharlto Copley, Anamaria Marinca and Michael Nyqvist, Europa Report is currently playing in select theaters and on VOD, and will be available on iTunes starting October 8. The movie is one of the few sci-fi films in recent years to offer a realistic depiction of a manned mission to outer space -- in this case, to search for life on Jupiter's moon Europa. I chatted with NASA- JPL astrobiologist Steve Vance, one of the science advisors on Europa Report, at the film's LA Film Festival premiere. Vance expressed to me his enthusiasm about the movie: I'm just thrilled that I got to be part of something that is bringing Europa more into the public eye. I'm really excited about how this movie captures the passion of exploration and also the science.Europa has been the focus of much attention in recent years because it may harbor life in the liquid water ocean that is theorized to exist under its icy crust. Vance, who studies the interiors of icy moons like Europa and who is acting staff scientist on NASA's Europa Project, told me that he and his colleagues are ""pre-formulating a mission that we hope will fly to Europa to address the same kind of questions that were addressed in the movie."" The most pressing of these questions is whether life independently developed on another body within our solar system. Although Vance noted that a manned mission to Europa isn't currently feasible, due to the difficulties of even sending a human as far as Mars, he explained that NASA is assessing plans to send a robotic spacecraft to Europa (see NASA artist's concept above): ""The mission we're looking at right now is [that] we'll do multiple flybys to orbit Jupiter, and do thirty or more flybys of Europa and completely map the surface."" (See this paper in the August issue of Astrobiology on future missions to Europa, co-authored by Vance). And this brings me to a larger point: whether it's robotic spacecraft taking photos of the surfaces of distant moons like Europa -- or movies that draw on that imagery to dramatize outer-space exploration -- visual representation plays a crucial role in bringing science to life. For example, the photos taken by the Galileo space probe as it orbited Jupiter and its moons from 1995 to 2003 gave the public the most detailed images yet of mysterious Europa and its icy, cracked outer shell. These photos (see below) then inspired the filmmakers of Europa Report. In turn, NASA scientists like Vance hope that movies like Europa Report will inspire public support for future missions back to Europa. In short, art and science play a surprisingly reciprocal role today.Given how important photos and imagery have been to NASA, I was amazed to read in a recent NASA blog post that in the 1960s, NASA debated whether to even put cameras on board spacecraft. Fortunately, with the Mariner 4 mission that brought back the first close-up photos of Mars in 1965, the agency realized how crucial images were to advancing scientific knowledge and inspiring the public.   Vance's JPL colleague Ken Williford reiterated the power of imagery in science. Williford, an astrobiologist and surface sampling scientist on the Mars Science Laboratory Mission, noted at the Europa Report screening: A scene that stood out for me was the scene of the lander coming down to the surface of Europa, so [that] we see the surface of Europa in high definition for the first time. It reminds me of when any of the images come down from the NASA spacecraft. We're sitting on the surface of Mars right now, and we get these gorgeous images ... and I bring them down as fast as I can every day. It's just incredible seeing new images of new exotic places, and I think that's just an old human desire -- to see new places, be new places.And that's what I found engaging about Europa Report: it takes as its starting point the idea that the real effort to explore outer space and acquire knowledge about the universe may be the most thrilling adventure of all.Sebastian Cordero, director of Europa Report, affirmed this when we spoke by phone, saying: One of the reasons I was involved in this film was that this is not a film about a threat. We're not talking about something coming to get us. ... It's much more about the thrill of discovery -- and the natural instinct for human beings to explore.Cordero added: As we were researching this, we talked to several astronauts and we watched the documentary that was a huge reference for this film, Al Reinert's For All Mankind, a documentary about the Apollo missions. What's so inspiring about that documentary is [that] you see that the drive behind those visions is so strong, that push for science to develop new materials, new elements. ... Ultimately the film is about space exploration, but also the human element of space exploration [which] is probably the most important element of all.One of the most striking moments in Europa Report is when the co-pilot Rosa (Anamaria Marinca) asks: ""Compared to the breadth of knowledge yet to be known, what does your life really matter?"" I asked Cordero about this line, noting that the moral ideal in our civilization is to value every human life -- and yet there is also an unquenchable human desire to acquire knowledge, often at a high cost. This, after all, is what drove Odysseus to listen to the song of the Sirens, despite all warnings to the contrary. Cordero responded: ""Definitely, and I think that what Rosa says in that line really boils down what the essence of the film is about."" And for filmmakers interested in sci-fi, that quest for knowledge can include having the chance to meet with astronauts and scientists, and see first-hand the exotic world of space exploration. Cordero agreed:It was really fascinating ... We had access from the beginning to great scientists, great minds, who are behind this exploration. For me as a filmmaker ... I was trying to depict space exploration in a realistic and faithful manner. The only way I could do that was if I had the support of people who really knew scientifically what's behind a journey like this to Europa. ... the actual science behind it [made] the film stronger.This research played a crucial role in shaping the movie. As Cordero described: To give you one example, in the original script, the end of the film took place only on the surface of the moon; there was never really any significant threat of the ship going under the ice ... And when we started doing research about what the surface of Europa would be like, and what's under it, and the threats for a real mission like this, [we realized] we had to play it with the ice being brittle ... [so] when you start finding out things like that you go, 'oh, that's extremely cinematic and it's real, so isn't it great to be able to incorporate both things and make that part of the story?' Just as filmmakers like Cordero find NASA's science inspiring, NASA scientists are intrigued by the movies and even become scientists thanks to sci-fi cinema. Both Steve Vance and Ken Williford recounted to me that they were inspired to pursue careers in astronomy by movies: Vance by Carl Sagan's Contact (and also by his epic TV series Cosmos), and Williford by The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars. Thus, even though science and art appear to exist on opposite poles, there is an intermingling between the two areas: the best scientists use their imagination like artists, and the best artists continually experiment to perfect their art. As a culture, we tend to celebrate artists who draw on the sciences, and scientists who are inspired by the arts, because both imply a broadness of perspective that sparks new insights and pushes civilization forward. Of course, always hovering in the background of any meaningful sci-fi story is real history, and the poignancy of scientific endeavor.Sebastian Cordero recounted to me the important role Galileo Galilei played in the backstory of Europa Report. It was the Italian scientist and humanist who was the first to discover four of Jupiter's moons, including Europa, on a winter night in 1610. Cordero noted: When you look back on Galileo and think of him looking at Europa for the first time through his telescope ... it's actually very poetic to think about everything that's happened since then, and where that led human exploration, and space exploration."

Hemmed in by the richest oil fields in California, the oil town of 6,700 with a stagnant economy and little room to expand has hatched an ambitious plan to annex vast expanses of land reaching eastward to Interstate 5, 18 miles away, and taking over various poor unincorporated communities to triple its population to around 20,000. With the price as light sweet crude at record high prices, Chevron and other companies are scrambling to drill new wells and reopen old wells once considered unprofitable. The renewed profits for oil men of Kern County, where more than 75 percent of all the oil produced in California flows, do not directly translate increased revenue for Taft. The Taft town council wants to cash in on the new oil boom with increased tax revenues from a NASCAR track and future developments near the freeway. In an earlier oil boom era, Taft was the site of the 1910 Lakeside Gusher, the biggest oil gusher ever seen in the US, which sent 100,000 barrels a day into a lake of crude.

The technology makes it possible for oil companies to unlock California's vast Monterey Shale deposit, estimated to hold 15.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil.But environmentalists across the nation have decried the practice, saying that the chemicals used in the process pollute underground water supplies and cause other damage. New York has instituted a moratorium on fracking, and Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed a strict set of regulations into law in June.The California law would require oil companies to obtain permits for fracking as well as acidizing, the use of hydrofluoric acid and other chemicals to dissolve shale rock.It would also require notification of neighbors, public disclosure of the chemicals used, as well as groundwater and air quality monitoring and an independent scientific study.The hotly contested bill drew strong opposition from many environmentalists, who said it did not go far enough and complained that a proposed moratorium was taken out, along with some tougher regulations.In his signing statement, Brown, who favors some level of fracking in the Monterey Shale, said he believed more changes would be necessary even as the law goes into effect next year.""The bill needs some clarifying amendments, and I will work with the author in making those changes next year,"" Brown said. He did not specify what changes he wanted to make.State Senator Fran Pavely, a Democrat who represents the Los Angeles suburb of Agoura Hills and was the author of the new law, said the regulations would stop oil companies from fracking in the state without full disclosure of their methods.""Oil companies will not be allowed to frack or acidize in California unless they test the groundwater, notify neighbors and list each and every chemical on the Internet,"" Pavely said. ""This is a first step toward greater transparency, accountability and protection of the public and the environment.""Opposing the measure along with the environmentalists was the oil industry, which said the new law could make it difficult for California to reap the benefits offered by development of the Monterey Shale, including thousands of new jobs, increased tax revenue, and higher incomes for residents.The law ""could create conditions that will make it difficult to continue to provide a reliable supply of domestic petroleum energy for California,"" said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western State Petroleum Association, which represents oil companies in California.The law will go into effect Jan. 1, 2014.
