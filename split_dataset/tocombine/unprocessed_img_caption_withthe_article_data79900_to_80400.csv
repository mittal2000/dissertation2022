0,SPORTS,Sam Fuld's Pro Baseball Journey Is Hardly Defined By His Diabetes,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sam-fuld-diabetes_us_55d4b886e4b0ab468d9f53a2,"""Every day has its new challenge.""",2015-08-27,<p>Fuld has played quality defense for the A's -- his fourth MLB team in eight years -- despite his struggles at the plate.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d680451700006e0056822f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There were 868 players on the 2015 MLB Opening Day rosters. One of them was the Oakland Athletics' Sam Fuld. As the outfielder enters his eighth season in the big leagues with a career .228 average and nearly as many strikeouts as hits, Fuld doesn't have numbers that will take him to Cooperstown. Nor will they earn him the glitz and glamour of All-Star games and premium endorsements. But what Fuld lacks in Hall of Fame talent, he makes up for in perseverance and grit. In fact, for him to reach the zenith of his sport -- and then to stay there for nearly a decade -- may actually be his most impressive accomplishment.Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 10 years old, Fuld, now 33, hardly seemed destined to become a professional athlete. People with diabetes rarely become pro baseball players, let alone Major Leaguers, in large part because the stress of the game can aggravate health problems. Moreover, Fuld's upbringing put a lot more emphasis on academics than sports. His father is the dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of New Hampshire, and his mother was a state senator and legislator. For Sam, developing his baseball talent was surely important, but so was developing his intellect.""I couldn't help but be aware of the importance they placed on education,"" Fuld told The Huffington Post of his parents.With that in mind, he attended Stanford University to advance his career both on and off the diamond. Fuld twice earned All-American honors while setting the College World Series all-time hits record, cementing him as one of the great players in the program's esteemed history. But his success was accompanied by a fair share of challenges.""I remember talking to a scout,"" Fuld said. ""This was my senior year at Stanford, so I had been drafted the year before. This guy said, 'Yeah, we were going to take you, but we had some concerns about your diabetes.' I just remember doing whatever I could to keep it inside of me. I was immediately furious.""In 2007, though, Fuld's dream of the majors became a reality. At 5 feet 10 inches and 175 pounds, he didn't have the sheer size of many other players. But he was a strong defensive outfielder and hit well enough in the minors for the Chicago Cubs to bring him up, albeit for a mere six at-bats. Fuld was ecstatic, but he also wanted more opportunities. Instead of letting the diabetes get the best of him, he turned it into an advantage the only way he could.""No single day is like the other,"" he said. ""Every day has its new challenge, and it's easy to get worn down by it and just give up... Having [diabetes] has forced me to be disciplined and develop a really strong work ethic.""The truth of the matter is that Fuld -- even during his best stretches as a pro -- has never been a true everyday player. He's never had more than 351 at-bats during the regular season, and his 12 career home runs are as much as some guys hit in two months. Moreover, he has played for four organizations and is enduring the most frustrating year of his career, hitting under the dreaded Mendoza line of .200 in a bit role for a wretched Oakland team. And at 33 years old, he's surely on the back nine of his career.But Fuld has a wonderfully refreshing outlook on his condition, one that has drawn effusive praise from many former teammates and coaches. One of them, Tampa Bay third baseman Evan Longoria -- a three-time All-Star and the 2008 Rookie of the Year -- remembers fondly the time he and Fuld spent with the Rays, believing that Fuld left an indelible mark. ""He's one of the best teammates I've ever had,"" Longoria told HuffPost. ""And he's a playmaker.""The reality of living with diabetes means that Fuld has to manage a set of pressures and imperatives entirely separate from the ones that come with being a professional athlete. Because his body does not naturally generate the necessary insulin, he must give himself injections with a pen throughout the day. It gets harder during games. Instead of focusing entirely on baseball, he has to monitor his insulin, often while on the bench or from the clubhouse. He realized the seriousness of his situation early on in his career.""When I was 18, in American Legion ball, I had already committed to go play at Stanford,"" Fuld said. ""I remember taking my blood sugar during a game and it was really high -- like up around 300 -- and taking my [kit] and throwing it across the dugout. I had a mini-panic attack.""Fuld doesn't want others to have to experience the same thing. He says he'd like to raise as much awareness of the disease as possible to help create more opportunities for young people with diabetes who may feel stuck or without inspiration. And he hopes to do so while maintaining his sense of humor along the way.""Luckily, I'm not the biggest guy in the world,"" Fuld joked. ""So nobody is going to accuse me of taking steroids when I'm injecting myself.""Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.

It will be awarded yearly to a student entering the media design and production program.Parker graduated from PHCC in 2009 with an associate degree.“Alison was a great example of what dedication and motivation can do in someone’s life,” Christopher Parker, director of the PHCC Foundation, said in a statement. “As a product of PHCC and Martinsville, she made us all proud of her achievements and the way she carried herself through that success in life.”The director has no relation to the slain journalist.James Madison University, where Parker graduated in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in media arts and design, has also set up a fund in her name.The university established the Alison B. Parker Memorial Fund in the School of Media Arts & Design in her honor. While a student at JMU, Parker kick-started her journalism career by serving as a reporter and editor for the student newspaper, The Breeze. Supporters are in the process of setting up a fund for Ward, who was killed while manning the camera during the morning broadcast on Wednesday, according to WDBJ7. Ward, a 2011 graduate of Virginia Tech, was beloved by his colleagues for both his professionalism and warm demeanor.“We get here really early in the morning and when we get in, they just make this newsroom come alive,” Leo Hirshburner, the station’s morning meteorologist, said in the wake of the tragedy.

4,MEDIA,Jorge Ramos Producer Speaks Out About Press Conference Incident,Gabriel Arana,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jorge-ramos-producer-speaks-out-about-press-conference-incident_us_55df4907e4b08dc09486bf86,"“In 30 years of covering dictatorships and corruption and things all across the Americas, he’s never been ejected from a press conference.”",2015-08-27,"<p>A security guard for Republican presidential candidate <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"">Donald Trump</a> removes Univision anchor Jorge Ramos from a news conference on Tuesday. Ramos had begun to ask Trump about his immigration proposal.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jorge Ramos and his producer at Fusion, Dax Tejera, had tried for months to score an interview with Donald Trump. After coming up empty, they decided to fly to Iowa to catch the Republican presidential candidate at Wednesday’s press conference. By now, most Americans know what happened: Ramos, a well-known and respected figure in Hispanic media, was ejected from the press conference when he tried to ask a question about Trump's immigration proposal, and Trump told him to ""go back to Univision."" Tejera, who was seated next to Ramos when the incident occurred, spoke to The Huffington Post about the incident and the way Fusion has approached its coverage of the presidential campaign.“In 30 years of covering dictatorships and corruption and things all across the Americas, he’s never been ejected from a press conference,” Tejera said. “We did not go in thinking that it was within the realm of possibility that we’d be thrown out for asking questions.”In the wake of the incident, critics have assailed Ramos for interrupting when another reporter was asking a question. Fox News host Howard Kurtz, for instance, wrote in an op-ed that Ramos “broke in without being called on — and I’m sorry, that’s not some polite society rule, that’s basic civility when a presidential candidate is taking questions.” But as Tejera pointed out, press conferences are often rambunctious, disorderly affairs where the loudest voice in the room is the one that is called on. There was no pre-existing list of questions Trump was set to take; reporters were jockeying to be heard, and given the Trump campaign’s previous stonewalling, Tejera and Ramos were not optimistic they’d be called on.“It was a classic press conference where everybody is trying to get their question in and the loudest voice gets it,” he said. According to Tejera, Ramos was in the middle of asking his question when Trump signaled to security to handle the situation.“I didn’t think a man running for president would signal to bodyguards to remove a reporter,” Tejera said.Outside the room where the press conference was taking place, a Trump supporter told Ramos to “go back to your country,” oblivious to the fact that Ramos is a naturalized U.S. citizen.Ramos was eventually allowed to rejoin the press conference, after another reporter questioned Trump about his decision to eject the Walter Cronkite of Hispanic media. But footage of the incident has sparked discussion not just among the public but among journalists. Some, like Politico’s Marc Caputo, have criticized Ramos for advocating for immigration reform. “This is bias: taking the news personally, explicitly advocating an agenda,” Caputo said on Twitter.While the idea that journalists should be neutral continues to have currency, it is, as Glenn Greenwald points out at The Intercept, a concoction of corporate media: a standard imposed to ensure those in power aren’t challenged. In reality, “objectivity” does little more than defang a reporter, forcing them to pretend they have no opinions and see no injustice.For example, none of the other ""objective"" reporters who have had access to Trump had bothered to point out, as Ramos did, that his plan to deport 11 million people from the country is impossible.Tejera says Ramos tries to distinguish himself by focusing on policy instead of the horse-race coverage that prevails on other networks.“The goal has always been to put him out as a journalist who is asking the tough questions,” he said. “What we felt was, particularly with immigration stuff, [Trump] is saying things that are factually inaccurate. Jorge felt Trump was misrepresenting the facts and felt like he needed to ask those.""“The whole reason for going to Iowa was to be able to have an informed line of questions,” he said. “That’s different from what the big networks are doing. Fusion is doing issues and not horse-race coverage.”“We didn’t go to Iowa to talk about the latest polls,” he added.After Ramos was allowed back into the press conference, he sparred with Trump for about five minutes before hinting he would be open to a sit-down interview. Tejera said Ramos would be eager to do a sit-down but he didn’t know if it would come to fruition. He credited Trump for reversing course after kicking Ramos out.“I’m struck by the fact that in short amount of time, Donald Trump really came around,” he said. “I give him credit for that.” Donald Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

5,SCIENCE,Scientists Reveal Secret To Dung Beetles' Impressive Navigation Skills,Eliza Sankar-Gorton,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dung-beetle-brain-navigation_us_55dddf49e4b08cd3359e1921,"""It’s really beautiful when you get a proper behavior, especially something fun, like a beetle rolling dung balls.""",2015-08-27,<p>Dung beetle brains are built so they can navigate day or night.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55dddfcc1400002e002e40de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dung beetles spend their days collecting other animals' poop to feed on. While they may not seem like the most elegant of creatures, it turns out their brains are impressively sophisticated.A study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals the specific brain mechanism in dung beetles that enables them to navigate their environments while simultaneously pushing around giant balls of poop.Scientists have long known that dung beetles use the sky to navigate. They are guided by the sun during the day and by the moon or Milky Way during the night. But the new research reveals exactly how the beetle brains' built-in GPS systems use these cues.""Sometimes in neuroscience we forget that we’re meant to be investigating how the brains of animals create behaviors in [the] real world,"" Dr. Paul Graham, an expert on insect navigation at the University of Sussex in England, who was not involved in this new research, told National Geographic. ""It’s really beautiful when you get a proper behavior—especially something fun, like a beetle rolling dung balls.""For the research, the scientists gave nocturnal and non-nocturnal dung beetles their own balls of poop. When the dung beetles began rolling the balls, the scientists manipulated the sunlight using mirrors, to make the dung beetles think the sun had moved locations. They found that both types of dung beetle were fooled and adjusted their course of movement.But when the scientists used the mirrors to manipulate the location of the moonlight they behaved differently. The non-nocturnal dung beetles were still fooled, but the nocturnal ones weren't and didn't change their path. The scientists discovered this is because their internal navigation system doesn't react to the location of the moon, but the light itself -- called polarized light or scattered light that’s generated by moonlight or light from the Milky Way, National Geographic reported. Humans cannot see polarized lightwaves, but insects and other animals, like bats, can detect them.The researchers concluded that while the sun or moon dominates the navigation of non-nocturnal dung beetles, the neurons in the brains of nocturnal dung beetles are designed to tune into polarized light at night. The findings help to explain why even on a moonless night, nocturnal dung beetles can navigate tough terrain.Also on HuffPost:"

In this Dec. 22, 1970, file photo, Bruce Davis (left) and Steve Grogan, two members fo the Charles Manson family, leave court after a hearing on the appointment of attorneys to represent them in Los Angeles. Davis, 72, has been down this path before. On three previous occasions, the board granted Davis parole only to have the decision reversed by the governor. Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) reversed the board's decision in 2010. Current Gov. Jerry Brown (D) reversed the rulings last year and in 2013, saying that Davis still posed a threat to the public because he withheld information about the deaths and downplayed his role within the Manson family, according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The board granted parole to 590 inmates in 2013, or to more than 14 percent of prisoners who appeared, according to data from the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Davis' lawyer applauded today's decision.""He's the single most rehabilitated inmate I've worked with over the years and there's not even a close second,"" attorney Michael Beckman told The Huffington Post. ""I’m pleased that the board again obeyed the law and did the right thing, and I hope that the governor will do the same.""For now, Davis remains imprisoned at California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo.In all, Manson and his cultish followers were linked to nine murders, including the killing of actor Sharon Tate, director Roman Polanski's wife. Manson is also serving a life sentence for his role in the murders of Tate and six others.  This story has been updated to include comment from Davis' lawyer."

Paul LePage (R) said Tuesday he may run for Senate in 2018, which would pit him against Sen. Angus King (I-Maine). ""I'm thinking about it very strongly,"" LePage told conservative radio host Howie Carr. In January, LePage also told Carr that he was looking at a Senate run, although the following day, he said he was joking. LePage has been a controversial governor known for making outlandish statements -- like joking that he wanted to shoot a newspaper cartoonist and comparing the IRS to the Gestapo. He won re-election in 2014, despite abysmal approval ratings. Carr tweeted out a photo with LePage Tuesday, showing the governor wearing a hat with Donald Trump's presidential slogan on it. LePage, however, has endorsed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) for president, and Carr had to tweet a clarification that LePage hadn't switched allegiances. LePage, who has never shied away from making eyebrow-raising comments about his critics, said Trump needs to knock off his feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly.""You’ve got to let this stuff go and move on,"" LePage said. ""Move on to the issues."""

13,POLITICS,Carly Fiorina Is Hopping Mad At CNN Over Looming Debate Snub,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carly-fiorina-is-hopping-mad-at-cnn-over-looming-debate-snub_us_55de3399e4b08dc094865fca,Her campaign has a good point -- CNN is blowing it.,2015-08-26,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Is CNN about to screw up its upcoming GOP primary debate by screwing over one of the candidates? At least one aggrieved Republican contender, Carly Fiorina, is angry today about the criteria the venerable cable news network will use to choose its debate participants, and her campaign has taken to the medium of Medium to air its grievances. Well, guess what? Fiorina's right, and CNN is wrong.But let's take a step back. During the midsummer run-up to the first GOP primary debate -- hosted by Fox News in Cleveland on Aug. 6 -- one big topic of conversation was the unwieldy size of the pool of contenders and how they could all be accommodated at one debate. And the novel solution that Fox hit upon was to not solve it at all: Instead of jamming 17 people on the stage, Fox -- using data from the five most recent polls -- would give those averaging in the top 10 the primetime debate slot. The unlucky seven that didn't make the cut would get a seat at a smaller table.For those seven candidates -- which, along with Fiorina, included Jim Gilmore, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal, George Pataki, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum -- sequestration at this minor debate meant they were really only going to get one shot at getting into the top tier. Realistically, there was only ever going to be one winner -- one candidate who'd ascend to the more rarefied air of the next mainstage debate, to be hosted by CNN on Sept. 16th in Simi Valley, California.Here's the thing, though! I thought that we were all basically in agreement about who it was that won that first undercard debate. Let's take a look at the headlines from the day after:Slate: ""Carly Fiorina Won the Preliminary Debate. It Wasn’t Even Close.""Washington Post: ""Carly Fiorina won the ‘Happy Hour’ debate. By a lot.""NBC News: ""Carly Fiorina Wins Buzz After 'Happy Hour' Debate""New York Post: ""Carly Fiorina surging in polls after ‘winning’ GOP debate""Vox: ""Carly Fiorina was the clear winner of Fox News's first debate""The Federalist: ""Carly Fiorina Easily Wins Early GOP Debate""Reuters, as rendered by  Business Insider: ""Everyone's saying Carly Fiorina won the early Republican debate today""So -- from online to print, national to local, left-leaning to right-leaning, to ""Everyone"" -- we sort of had a clear consensus: the winner was Carly Fiorina. And more importantly, voters quantitatively agreed:Here, via HuffPost Pollster, you can see how everyone stuck at the ""happy hour"" debate has fared since the lights went down that night. The only candidate whose fortunes are diverging in the right direction is Fiorina. This is how this was supposed to work! Seven candidates were going to have one opportunity to move up, and -- as with Highlanders -- there could be only one. Fiorina was that one, plain and simple.Obviously, the Fiorina campaign agrees with this point of view, and over at their outpost on Medium, Deputy Campaign Manager Sarah Isgur Flores has compiled even more compelling data backing up their case:In the three national polls that have been released since the debate, Carly is between 4th and 7th place. Her name ID and net favorability have risen by double digits. And she has continued to impress crowds during her most recent trips to Iowa, New Hampshire, Georgia, and Nevada.I mean, this all checks out. So what's the problem here? Well, in this post, Flores accuses ""the political establishment"" of ""rigging the game to keep Carly off the main debate stage."" I don't think the problem is that ornate. I just think CNN is using some perplexing standards to determine its top 10, by which I mean it's going to use poll data from polls dating back to July 16. Per Flores:Carly would easily make this debate if there were a consistent number of polls from one week to the next, but that’s not the case. In the three weeks before the first debate, CNN will be counting nine polls. In the three weeks since the debate, they will only be counting two. By simply averaging these polls together, CNN will be weighting the three weeks of polling before the debate more than three times as heavily as the three weeks of polling after Carly won the first debate.Yeah, that's stupid. At this point, polls from mid-July have no salience. The beginning of the debate season marked an escalation in voter engagement and truly opened the competitive period of the nominating contest. By giving such weight to polls from what is, for all intents and purposes, a bygone age, CNN is making it much harder for Fiorina to capitalize on the momentum she's earned -- a phenomenon that Philip Bump demonstrates in great detail at The Washington Post.More importantly, CNN is making it harder for its readers and viewers to obtain an accurate picture of where the GOP race has gone in the past month and what the state of play is now -- and an accurate picture would place Fiorina squarely in contention and in the conversation.I don't necessarily think that CNN is purposefully putting its thumb on the scale, here, because the network would really have nothing to gain by intentionally excluding Fiorina. But from the campaign's point of view, you may as well go out and make the accusation of a ""rigged"" system. Out here in the real world, where real voters have registered their newfound appreciation for Fiorina in appreciable ways, any decision to exclude her just doesn't square. Let's just look again at the current HuffPost Pollster polling average, with the entire field included:We have Fiorina in a safe seventh place at the moment, which would comfortably get her into the mainstage debate. Besides, can it credibly be said that she belongs with her former competitors from August's smaller debate? Right now, if those six candidates and their polling numbers combined to form Loser GOP Presidential Candidate Voltron, they  still couldn't overtake Fiorina.This is dumb and CNN needs to fix this. Carly Fiorina earned promotion from the smaller table, and the next debate should reflect that. Putting her back in the also-ran division will send the message to voters that there's no point to tuning in to that lesser competition, and that overcoming that interesting and daunting challenge -- which Fiorina did! -- is meaningless. Fiorina is seventh.  Let her debate, and don't worry about the other six contenders who couldn't get out of the lower division. You surely aren't going to see Rick Perry or Bobby Jindal writing a blog post on Medium about how they ""won"" that debate, anyway. Though it would be highly entertaining.---[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not!]Also on HuffPost:"
