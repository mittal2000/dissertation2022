They are ready to peck at just about anything with some meat to it. Sometimes, they really tear you apart.",2016-06-26,2016-05-19-1463665781-884038-you_could_look_better.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-19-1463665781-884038-you_could_look_better-thumb.jpg,"Having a Disqus commenting account is a truth serum, of sorts. If you're a kind, analytical person who likes to consider the opinions of others and thoughtfully present your own perspective, internet commenting will bring that out. If you're a big asshole, it will bring that out of you, too. As I've started to branch out and write for more online mediums, I've realized that writing an article on the internet is equivalent to throwing yourself to the vultures. They are ready to peck at just about anything with some meat to it. Sometimes, they really tear you apart. It would be nice to take the ""don't worry what people think of you"" lessons from teachers and parents of our childhood. However, ""back then,"" I don't think they had the entire internet in mind. Within an article, the first few comments will sometimes sway the rest in something of a bandwagon effect. In an era of listicles and filler content, when you work really hard on something only to have the negativity brigade come and flip out on you, it can be disheartening. I'm noticing that it affects my writing on certain topics. It shouldn't. But there. I said it. If you've never been published on the merciless internet, trust me, a thick skin is easier talked about than owned. A deep thinker (and maybe a bit of an over-thinker), I always examine a ""problem,"" like internet trolls, and try to decide if it is instead a symptom of a larger issue. What's the real problem, here? I think there is more than one. First, what's interesting is that we clutch our pearls at young teens posting ""Hot or Not"" pictures on the internet, snapping nudes, and allowing themselves to be publicly judged by anyone with a WiFi connection. But really, this baring for approval has become a cultural phenomenon, transcending teens and adolescent social media. Just about everybody does it. We'll take ten pictures before we post the perfect one to Instagram. We will travel to the coolest places on Earth, just to filter the experience through a camera lens. We will attend a relative's concert and miss the essence of it, because we are too busy trying to get the iPad switched to the right mode for easy uploading (...and compliment-fishing) later that night. The entire way we interact with our world has shifted.In the world of social media ""sharing,"" we get the privilege of seeing every single person who is--or who is appearing to be--thinner, better, smarter, funnier, cooler, and prettier. If we participate in the internet community, regardless of which social media platform, we toss our tickets in to an endless competition with no tangible victory.  By ""MOBSTR,"" viaUnfortunately, writing is no different. Writing has become so exploited, whored and demeaned, that talented writers think they are lucky to be paid $10, if at all, for a 1000-word article. If you aren't a writer and can't spatially imagine 1000 words, think of it like this: I'm barely halfway there right about now. Our words take time in a world that doesn't have any time. A person's art, which is relegated to the internet because that's just how things are, has become the venting forum for someone who hasn't gotten enough likes on Instagram. Back to the schoolyard: ""bullies who are mean to others do it so they feel better about themselves."" It tells something about our society that so many haven't grown out of it yet. Lastly, it has become a gender issue. I, personally, am not a PC-policewoman, but the taunting on female journalists' pieces is utterly nauseating. In fact, nauseating might not be a strong enough word. Lately, we have female newscasters and writers reporting that not only do they get rape threats on the pieces they write, some commenters find it necessary to communicate their horrendousness directly to the supposed sacred space of a journalist's home via a personal visit or phone call. All for an internet article that the commenter didn't like. It's tempting to say ""don't let those jerks win!"" and that this is the path women need to take toward full equality, to pave the way, if you will. However, if a woman, quite literally, fears for her safety, it's completely understandable why she might stop. Not all of us want to fight the good fight. Of course the moral of the story is to think before you type and maybe be a little nicer to each other, but that won't be enough. What is wrong with us? It's a vicious circle, really. As a general rule, we don't fill each other's tanks with deep love and approval, and instead worry about how the rest of the world sees us on account of being made to feel insecure since childhood. Just take the recent article in The Atlantic, which states that almost half of middle-class Americans can't come up with $400 for an emergency. Underemployment and financial struggle account for some it, sure, but if we go by the author's choices, draining a 401k for a lavish wedding sounds more like keeping up appearances. Man, do we live for appearances. It makes for the perfect consumer culture that we all bask in. When you feel like shit about yourself, you'll try harder to convince others that you don't. You'll buy more clothes, shoes, home decor, purses, belts, hair care products, Botox, implants, and BMWs. And we do. And we take pictures to show how we do. And our kids learn real quick. The biggest challenge in America is to live a simple life of virtue. Just about everything steers you to do otherwise. So we end up, in some way or another, empty shells, commenting on people's pieces and ripping them a new one so we can feel like we've expressed our intellect enough for one day. The problem isn't the comment. The problem is the pervasive, sad psyche behind it. The potential for meta-commenting on this article isn't lost on me:""It wouldn't QUITE be meta-commenting since people are commenting on the article"" Thanks, but it's close enough. ""Well MY husband and I DON'T worry about what other people think."" Marvelous. ""You have it all wrong..."" Okay.""I always taught my kids not to post these things to social media."" Yep. Good for you. ""Don't write on the internet if you can't take criticism."" Read it again. It isn't about criticism, or challenging someone's point. It's about bullying and unnecessary meanness. ""You're just insecure."" Maybe. Every last one of us is, though. All I want to see out of this world, before I die, is better critical thinking. Question what you do. Think about social media. See the implications. See that there is a corporate agenda that does better when we are low and competing with each other constantly. Also, for God's sake, don't be an asshole. American life is hard enough for all of us. That's all."

But this entire being off for two months leaves me exhausted. Mentally and physically, and financially.I never knew that so much milk and juice could go so quickly. I can literally see the money floating from my pockets out of the window. Floating on the summer breeze to a land far, far away. On top of the amount of food they eat, there are friends that come over, the increase in the electric bill, and the sudden recreation costs. On one hand, I guess I could send them to a summer camp. But then I would feel some kind of way for making them leave home to be entertained. Don't get me wrong, I love my babies. But I miss their teachers. I miss that exhilarating feeling of student drop off in the morning. That brief feeling of freedom. Those hours of quiet without having to yell ""Stop."" ""No,"" and without having to respond to the thousandth request for lunch and snacks. But through all of the sandwiches and juice boxes and freshly cut fruit, there are the memories we are making. Learning to skate, the trips to the community fountains to play in the water sprinkler, late night runs for freezies, and trips to the museums and parks. While I will cherish those memories, I'm still looking forward to that day when I will be able to pull up in the child drop off line, blow kisses to my youngest, smile at her teachers, and wave while I ride off into the morning full of caffeine and deadlines."

Since then support for independence has not shifted significantly, according to polls.On Thursday Britain as a whole voted to leave the EU, but Scotland voted by 62 to 38 percent to remain. The SNP argues that many Scots opted to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014 because they believed that was the only way to guarantee EU membership.The SNP argues Thursday's outcome changes the case for independence, and many Scots may reassess their 2014 vote. Sturgeon on Friday said a new referendum was ""highly likely.""After meeting ministers in her devolved government on Saturday, Sturgeon said Scotland would not allow its EU membership to be taken away without exploring all the possibilities and would seek to build broad-based support at home and abroad to maintain it.""We will seek to enter into immediate discussions with the EU institutions and with other EU member states to explore all possible options to protect Scotland's place in the EU,"" said Sturgeon, speaking outside her official residence.She reiterated that an independence vote could be offered.""A second (Scottish) independence referendum is clearly an option that requires to be on the table, and it is very much on the table,"" she said.She would also establish a panel of experts to advise the Scottish government on legal, financial and diplomatic matters concerning EU membership.Any new vote should be decided by ""clear public appetite,"" but the independence option should be there, said a spokesman for the Scottish Greens, the kingmaker for Sturgeon's SNP. Her party is two seats shy of a majority in the devolved parliament.""It is too soon to say whether and when a further referendum on Scottish independence will take place, but in the wake of the EU referendum result few people will doubt that it must be on the table,"" a spokesman for the party told Reuters.Wille Rennie, leader of Scotland's pro-EU Liberal Democrats said in a statement he had committed his party to backing Sturgeon's EU negotiation process, but had received a guarantee this was not a ruse for a new independence drive.Splitting Scotland from the UK would end three centuries of shared history, upending another successful economic relationship shortly after the now-impending divorce between Britain and the EU.(Reporting By Elisabeth O'Leary; Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa and Michael Holden)"
5,THE WORLDPOST,"After Brexit, French Politicians Want English Language Out Of EU Too","Geoffroy Clavel, HuffPost France",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/french-politicians-english-language-brexit_us_576ede1fe4b0dbb1bbbac730,Just one problem: There are other English-speaking EU countries.,2016-06-25,"After the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union on Thursday, some French politicians want English out as an official EU language.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576ee1951500002a0073c99b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Is the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union going to deal a fatal blow to the language of Shakespeare on the continent? English, one of the 24 official languages of the EU, is very much spoken in Brussels and in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. But according to certain leading French politicians, its status after the Brexit should be questioned.On Friday morning, the mayor of the southern French town of Béziers, Robert Ménard -- a man with close ties to the National Front -- reckoned that English no longer had ""any legitimacy"" in Brussels.Left-wing presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who supports moving away from European treaties, has, for his part, said that English can no longer be ""the third working language"" of the European Parliament.In various ways, they're both wrong. The very complex operation of multilingualism in European institutions doesn't rely on the single criterion of a member state's membership in -- or withdrawal from -- the EU.The EU's official languages are communicative languages recognized by the institutions. At the inception of the European structure, during the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951, there were four: French, German, Italian and Dutch. Today there are 24 of these official languages, including Bulgarian, Danish, Croatian and, obviously, English. In the European Parliament, all documents and discussions must be translated simultaneously into the 24 languages.The official language of a member state doesn't automatically become an official language of the EU (as is notably the case with Luxembourgish). This recognition happens at the request of the state. If a state withdraws, its language might also be withdrawn, even if a case for it was never made.Nevertheless, Great Britain's exit should not be enough to abolish the use of English in Brussels, contrary to what Robert Ménard thinks. That is quite simply because the English language is one of the official languages of Ireland and Malta, who are still members of the EU.Jean-Luc Mélenchon's proposal is subtler because the European MP is targeting English not in its capacity as an official language, but as a working language. To enable the fluidity of exchanges within the EU, certain discussions led by certain institutions happen in a limited number of languages. Contrary to what the presidential candidate asserts, this isn't the case during sessions of the European Parliament (except for press conferences). The European Commission, however, does have three official working languages: French, German and English.This linguistic choice is clearly tied to member states' influence, but it also follows practical concerns and historical traditions. Deliberation in the European Union Court of Justice takes place in French, as do the majority of discussions in the European Court of Auditors.So although the U.K. doesn't use the euro and has preserved its monetary sovereignty, the European Central Bank has, since its creation, always and exclusively used the English language. And this is not for London's sake, but for the sake of not complicating its extremely sensitive communication by multiplying the channels of translation.This article first appeared on HuffPost France. It has been translated into English and adapted for an American audience."

A widely condemned ad from Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party showed a massive line of migrants with the text “Breaking Point.”But London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim elected to that office, made it clear that non-British Europeans living in his city were still welcome.“I want to send a clear message to every European resident living in London -- you are very welcome here,” Khan said in a Friday Facebook post that was shared by over 100,000 people. “As a city, we are grateful for the enormous contribution you make, and that will not change as a result of this referendum.”Khan has personal experience with the bigotry expressed by some of those Brexit activists. Before he was elected in May, his opponent painted him as an extremist, echoing Farage’s comments last year that there was a faction of Muslim immigrants trying to fundamentally change Britain’s culture.The mayor, who had sided with the ""remain"" forces in the Brexit debate, noted that nearly one million European citizens live in London.The majority of Londoners voted to stay in the EU. When the country as a whole disagreed with them, some even called for the city to seek independence from the U.K.Others reached out to reassure EU citizens. One Italian couple living in London found a postcard Friday morning from a neighbor, who wrote that he hoped they would ""stay and be part of the city for many, many years.""Yet the future of the three million non-British EU citizens currently living in the U.K. is uncertain. The Vote Leave group was explicit that they should be allowed to stay indefinitely. However, legal experts told the Guardian that there could be new hurdles like re-establishing residency status and that other rights could change. Europeans who live in the U.K. expressed concerns about their future. Tadeusz Kaminski, who works as a baker and hails from Warsaw, Poland, told the Daily Mail that the outcome of the vote shocked her.“I think it's a very bad idea,” Kaminski said. “I don't even know if I'll have a future in the UK anymore.”Khan ended his statement on Friday by calling for unity. “We all have a responsibility to now seek to heal the divisions that have emerged throughout this campaign -- and to focus on what unites us, rather than that which divides us,” he said."

He said the new leader would make the decision about when to invoke Article 50 and start the formal process of leaving the EU.Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty states that after notification of a wish to leave the EU, the exiting member state has two years to negotiate a deal.Elliott said the full settlement on Britain's exit would include all aspects of the relationship, including the British contribution to the EU, access to the single market, extradition agreements and so-called passporting for financial services.""This is basically the full settlement on everything from our contribution to the EU - when that ends - and would also include access to the single market, it would have to include the status of certain agreements we have on extradition so there is a whole multiplicity of areas we have to cover,"" he said.When asked whether it would include ""passporting"" rights for financial services companies in Britain to operate in the EU, he said: ""Yes absolutely, it would be a full spectrum agreement covering everything to do with our relationship with the EU.""""There is no reason why a sensible arrangement couldn't be put in place for passporting to continue,"" he said.Since the result of the referendum became clear on Friday morning, more than a million people have signed a petition for a new EU referendum that would require a higher level of support for taking a decision on membership.But Elliott said the referendum decision to leave the EU had been made by the British people and that it would be implemented.""This is the decision that has been made - it is going to happen. There is no way of wriggling out of it,"" he said.(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Kate Holton and Digby Lidstone)"

The park has largely succeeded in protecting mountain gorillas, its top tourist draw, from violence. Their population is now growing.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576d2fd32200002e00f82c8e.jpeg?cache=lzri99xID0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Around 480 mountain gorillas live within the confines of Virunga, Africa's oldest national park. The critically endangered primates are among the most threatened animals in the world, and the population inside the region is the only gorilla species on the rise.But despite it's renowned status, including a designation as a World Heritage Site, Virunga has become a war zone.National Geographic sent two correspondents into the park to investigate the thorny relationship between people trying to save Virunga and those jockeying to use the park's resources to survive.Correspondent Justin Hall spent time with the park's director Emmanuel de Merode, who's been working on an ambitious effort to bring hydropower to the region. Once finished, the four projects -- two of which are already online -- will supply far more energy than the region needs. Under de Merode's plan, any surplus could be sold to help stabilize the impoverished country and make the park economically viable.""What that's aiming to do is electrify the region,"" Hall, the host of an episode of Nat Geo's ""Explorer"" series on Virunga, told The Huffington Post. ""The major plan is to create a supply of energy ... to create jobs locally and supply lasting betterment in the quality of life.""Some 4 million people live along the border of Virunga, a 3,000-square mile expanse of dense jungle on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Many survive on less than $1.25 day, dependent on an illicit charcoal and bushmeat industry that's encroached on the park.Hall said the realities of this conservationist-local relationship present a complex dynamic that can't be fixed by classifying the region as a national park or protecting its fauna with ""endangered"" labels.""People have died in conflict in this area,"" he said, noting many came from neighboring Rwanda after the 1994 genocide. ""They are born of trauma, essentially -- they have nothing to rely on. They look to the park to sustain them on a very fundamental level.""Hall also embedded with a local militia known as the Mai-Mai, which has violently defended illicit financial interests in the park. Since 1996, 152 park rangers have been killed in Virunga. De Merode himself survived being shot four times during an ambush in 2014.""If it sounds harsh, imagine what it'll do to the minds of young kinds, left alone in a world that doesn't care,"" Hall said, noting many young people are swept into militias like the Mai-Mai in search of a better life. ""You can see how an armed group -- power, camaraderie, weaponry -- would be inspiring. They look to the park as a means to extract money and power.""Virunga survives on just an $8 million annual protection budget -- far less than the billion dollars a year the land would bring were it developed. De Merode's plan to utilize the vast hydroelectric resources and form lasting infrastructure hopes to shield the park from such efforts. But the $166 million project is an expensive endeavor.“The truth is that we’re not going to succeed unless we mobilize a critical mass of funding,"" he told Nat Geo's Robert Draper.

The critically endangered primates are among the most threatened animals in the world, and the population inside the region is the only gorilla species on the rise.But despite it's renowned status, including a designation as a World Heritage Site, Virunga has become a war zone.National Geographic sent two correspondents into the park to investigate the thorny relationship between people trying to save Virunga and those jockeying to use the park's resources to survive.Correspondent Justin Hall spent time with the park's director Emmanuel de Merode, who's been working on an ambitious effort to bring hydropower to the region. Once finished, the four projects -- two of which are already online -- will supply far more energy than the region needs. Under de Merode's plan, any surplus could be sold to help stabilize the impoverished country and make the park economically viable.""What that's aiming to do is electrify the region,"" Hall, the host of an episode of Nat Geo's ""Explorer"" series on Virunga, told The Huffington Post. ""The major plan is to create a supply of energy ... to create jobs locally and supply lasting betterment in the quality of life.""Some 4 million people live along the border of Virunga, a 3,000-square mile expanse of dense jungle on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Many survive on less than $1.25 day, dependent on an illicit charcoal and bushmeat industry that's encroached on the park.Hall said the realities of this conservationist-local relationship present a complex dynamic that can't be fixed by classifying the region as a national park or protecting its fauna with ""endangered"" labels.""People have died in conflict in this area,"" he said, noting many came from neighboring Rwanda after the 1994 genocide. ""They are born of trauma, essentially -- they have nothing to rely on. They look to the park to sustain them on a very fundamental level.""Hall also embedded with a local militia known as the Mai-Mai, which has violently defended illicit financial interests in the park. Since 1996, 152 park rangers have been killed in Virunga. De Merode himself survived being shot four times during an ambush in 2014.""If it sounds harsh, imagine what it'll do to the minds of young kinds, left alone in a world that doesn't care,"" Hall said, noting many young people are swept into militias like the Mai-Mai in search of a better life. ""You can see how an armed group -- power, camaraderie, weaponry -- would be inspiring. They look to the park as a means to extract money and power.""Virunga survives on just an $8 million annual protection budget -- far less than the billion dollars a year the land would bring were it developed. De Merode's plan to utilize the vast hydroelectric resources and form lasting infrastructure hopes to shield the park from such efforts. But the $166 million project is an expensive endeavor.“The truth is that we’re not going to succeed unless we mobilize a critical mass of funding,"" he told Nat Geo's Robert Draper. For now, even with those plans only half completed, Virunga's wildlife has begun to rebound. Populations of mountain gorillas are on the rise, primarily due to intense conservation efforts.But Hall says Virunga still needs the world's attention, and it shouldn't take Oscar-nominated documentaries or a horrific news event like the slaughter of several gorillas in 2008 to spur action.""It shouldn't take a catastrophe to make people react, to be inspiried to get involved, to put focus on this area of the world again,"" he said.

10,BUSINESS,Brexit Could Encourage British Companies To Pollute And Waste More,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brexit-pollution_us_576da286e4b0f1683239a010,Oof.,2016-06-25,"Only two areas of corporate policy seem likely to fall below European Union standards in the wake of the Brexit, according to the Sustainalytics report.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576da2ec2200002d00f82ee6.png?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Splitting away from the European Union won't just choke the British economy. British companies may end up creating more trash and dirtying the air in the wake of the Brexit, according to a new report. When the EU's ambitious targets for reducing waste and increasing recycling first went into effect two years ago, the United Kingdom pushed back, insisting that it would be too expensive for businesses to comply. Once negotiations to leave the EU are complete -- a process that could take two years or more -- U.K. legislators may scale back those regulations, found a report examining environmental and social governance at U.K. corporations from investor research firm Sustainalytics.“Recycling rights in the U.K. trailed off in the last few years,” Doug Morrow, a Toronto-based associate director at Sustainalytics who co-authored the report, told The Huffington Post. “We wouldn’t be surprised if we found a relaxation of the recycling targets.” Companies polluting the air in England may be able to breathe easier, too. In memos leaked to The Guardian in May, Rory Stewart -- the Conservative environment minister under Prime Minister David Cameron, who announced his resignation in the wake of the Brexit vote -- urged British members of the European parliament to undermine new EU regulations on air pollution by pushing for an amendment allowing Britain to exceed those standards. Such a change would give leeway to sectors that emit a lot of carbon into the atmosphere, such as the auto industry.“We would not be surprised if, once the terms [of the Brexit] are renegotiated, the U.K. moved to relax some of the domestic air pollution standards,” Morrow said. “It’s relatively well known that the U.K. has struggled with implementing some of the EU’s directives on this front.”In January, just eight days into the new year, London had already breached the EU’s air pollution limits. Even so, there’s no need to panic, Morrow said. The report, which judged British companies in nine areas of corporate governance, found that policy change was unlikely in all but recycling and air pollution. The other areas are climate change, human capital, product quality standards, health and safety, corporate governance, executive pay and intellectual property rights.“We don’t foresee a likely divergence, certainly over the short run, because a lot of the relevant EU directives have become embedded in the way things are so foundationally,” Morrow said. “On both sides of the debate, the Leave and the Stay, there was an exaggeration of what it’ll mean for U.K. companies.”“Though,” he added, “obviously they have two years to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal.” When you consider that in 2014 Cameron lauded the decision by Scottish voters to remain a part of the U.K., a lot can change in two years."

Around 50 animals will stay at the site because their health conditions or age make transporting them too risky.The zoo, founded in 1875, has come under fire in recent years from critics of some animals' living conditions. In 2012, the zoo’s polar bear, Winner, died on Christmas morning from a combination of overheating and stress from local fireworks.Two sea lions at the zoo died in August of last year, one due to stress and another from overfeeding. And in October, the Buenos Aires Herald reported on a slew of complaints about the zoo from animal rights groups, city legislators and zoo workers themselves. The outlet painted a depressing picture of the zoo, citing a bored elephant stuck alone in a patch of dirt and a Siberian tiger “that whimpers as it paws on the glass wall.” Attorney Gerardo Biglia, who was involved in campaigns to close the zoo, said in a statement that the shutdown seems only natural.“I think there is a change coming for which we are already prepared because kids nowadays consider it obvious that it’s wrong for animals to be caged,” he said."

And earlier, this one, in the Voices section: ""When Your 4th Grade Son is Called 'Gay.'"" Today was our shoe shopping day. My 10-year-old needed shoes badly, as his big toe had finally pushed through the few strands of fabric that were holding the toe cap together for the past two months.I took my son to the shoe store we've been going to for years. Only this time, as I made my way left to the boys section, my son departed and went confidently to the right, to the girls section. That was a shoe store first, so I followed his lead.He knew exactly what he was getting, and when the announcement came over the speaker that it was “buy-one-get-one-half-priced day,” he knew exactly which two pairs he was getting. The first pair was pink, sparkly, glittery, shimmery, and they lit up. The second pair was pink, sparkly, glittery, shimmery, and they lit up. The only difference was one had velcro; the other had laces.These were most definitely feminine-looking shoes. Coincidentally, this particular line of shoes was called “Twinkle Toes.” If memory serves, this was a name hurled as an insult towards more effeminate boys when I was his age.I reminded my son that these shoes would also serve as his new school sneakers for the fall.“I know,” he said with a smile, unfazed.I said, “Well, at least make sure you look around the store before making a final decision.”He indulged me by pirouetting his eyes around the store without moving his body. Then he said, “I’m good.”At this point, I didn’t even know what I was concerned about, because he carried a girl’s backpack to school every day this past year and has already worn a dress in public and girl’s pajamas to school on pajama day. I guess it was just one more step towards independence that made me nervous.Just to be certain, though, I walked him over to the boy aisle, showed him a random pair of sneakers and said, “Do you like these?”“Nope,” he responded swiftly. “Too manly.”I didn’t think anymore and just responded, “Alrighty then, Twinkle Toes it is.”He also picked out several neon, hot pink, purple, and yellow ankle socks before we checked out, and when all was said and done, we left with two new pairs of shoes and four pairs of good quality socks for under $100 -- a rare occasion when it comes to athletic footwear.As soon as we got into the car, he peeled off his old blue sneakers, delicately placed the new shoes on his feet, looked down in admiration, took a photo, and posted it to Instagram, hashtag: “SPARKLES!”I smiled when I saw how happy he looked. Out of curiosity, I asked him, “Why haven’t you picked shoes from the girl’s aisle before today?”He answered, “Just like with the toys -- I didn’t realize that I could!”I felt both a sense of guilt and frustration -- guilt because, duh? Why did I assume he would generalize the “gender neutral toy/costume rule” in our house automatically to shoes as well?I felt frustration, because why can’t all kids just shop for shoes all in the same section? Shoes, even more so than clothing choices, should be gender neutral. Girls can wear Converse and Doc Martens and combat boots with no issue. Why can’t boys’ shoes also come in pink or glitter? But I forgot my brain tangent when I looked back at him and he was kicking his feet up in the air, a huge smile of exhilaration spread across his face. I wanted to remember this moment, so I pointed my phone in his direction and captured it.We had some errands to run after shoe shopping, so we did them with my son proudly wearing his loud, light-up, sparkly, girly shoes. He even leaped a few times between sidewalks and curbs. I was witnessing sheer happiness and freedom. I was witnessing a rockstar. A rockstar in twinkle toe sneakers. I have some pretty amazing people in my life who I must thank profusely for their concern over the hateful or negative comments we received following my other published pieces. As expected, many of them have been pointed in our family's direction regarding our support of raising a gender creative boy. I want to assure all my lovely friends that despite a world of misunderstanding and sometimes even hatred, we're good. I'm a theatre person who has been picked apart by directors most of my life. A few negative comments on social media will not discourage or sway me to stop talking about this important, ignored ""white elephant in the room."" We can no longer to afford to call effeminate young boys names like, ""sissy,"" ""pansy,"" ""gay,"" ""fag,"" or worse. This is an epidemic that has got to stop. There's nothing inherently wrong with words typically associated with femininity, but when those words are used as weapons, as the lowest possible form of male mockery, or to label a kid who doesn't even have sexuality on his or her radar yet, it's absolutely not okay. In fact, it's sexual harassment, and as such, falls under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX is further clarified by this letter issued in 2010, from the Office of Civil Rights, stating, ""Harassment does not have to include intent to harm, be directed at a specific target, or involve repeated incidents."" So, despite what is taught in schools, and contrary to the belief of many folks, harassment does not even have to happen more than once for it to be considered harassment. I'm actively choosing to focus instead on all the love that has surrounded us. It truly is overwhelming. Receiving messages from people all over the U.S. and even Canada who have reached out to say, ""My child is gender creative, too"" has been incredibly heart-warming. I've heard from grown people who were bullied all throughout childhood -- by family, friends, or both. I've heard from parents of gender creative or trans children who, just like me, are looking to connect. In this age of online social media, my son has even gained an old-fashioned, letter-writing pen pal, the gender creative young son of a family I've met on this parenting journey. Some have reached out, acknowledging the need to continue the conversation that gender expression and/or creativity is nothing new. Perhaps the lingo and terminology are new components, but strongly effeminate young boys and strongly masculine young girls, or any combination thereof, have always been around. Everyone can probably remember at least one from his or her childhood. For every one that we can remember, there were probably twice as many that we were unaware of, who were forced into hiding. Like the boys who were shamed by family or peers, told to ""man up,"" or to ""quit being a mama's boy"" -- or girls who were asked with raised eyebrows, ""you play football?"" or, aside comments made and murmured to ""go easy on her.""  Gender creative people have been around forever. Just one example lies within Native Americans, who have “Two-Spirited” people in their tribes. Two-Spirited people are said to encompass both genders and often are the most revered people in their culture. So, despite hate speech, people who refuse to understand, or outcries that parents like me are merely “virtue-signaling” on social media, I will keep fighting for equal rights, because I want a better world for my children.Among the comments, though, were a few recurrent questions, the same questions I've been hearing for years, so they're easy to answer and hopefully can attempt to clear up confusion for people who are interested in understanding. The first most common question is always some form of:Q). ""But how does your husband/his dad feel about this?"" A). I guess some people assume a father figure could not possibly agree to raising a gender creative son. However, I'm happy to report that my husband of nearly 20 years is 100 percent supportive of raising all three of our children exactly as they are. This includes: our oldest, cisgender*, straight, male son; our middle, cisgender*, straight, female daughter; and our youngest, gender creative* male son. We can't determine his sexual preference or gender identity yet (cisgender or transgender). We can only go with what he's telling us, and that's that he is ""happy being a boy"" but ""just likes all 'girly' things."" While at first it was a little unnerving for my husband to see his son not grow out of this supposed ""phase,"" he quickly realized, ""this is what makes him happy, he's not hurting anyone, and that's really all that matters."" The next most common question/comment we get is some form of:Q). ""That's all fine and good, as long as you're being honest with your son, and being truthful about how hard of a time he's going to have, getting bullied and all...""A). First, we are all about honesty. We have lots of ""family meetings."" Pretty much any conversation topic is fair game. But honestly, we haven't really even had to have many of those conversations with our son about how ""tough it's going to be,"" because he has already been experiencing weird looks, rude comments, and intrusive questions his whole life. He doesn't know any other reality. Fourth grade was his hardest year yet, probably because it's the beginning of puberty and thus the beginning of social exclusions that come with kids searching for their unique identities. I have always been open about my son's gender creativity, even when he was young and I was searching for resources and support. I'm just speaking from a somewhat bigger platform now. But I didn't begin to speak from a bigger platform until I asked my son if he was okay with it. He was not only okay with it, but was enthusiastic about it. He wants his story told. So that's what I attempt to do. To address the second part of this concern... saying, ""okay, but he's going to have to accept being bullied..."" well, that's straight up victim-blaming, and victim-blaming is never okay.The third most common question we get is some form of: Q). ""But why the need to label? Can't kids just be kids?""A). In my experience raising three of them, no, because that's not the way it tends to work with kids. Kids are going to get labeled regardless, typically by one another. For kids who are gender different or non-conforming, those labels can be life-crushing. Before our society had the term ""gender creative,"" the common label was ""tomboy"" for girls, and for boys... well, there was no friendly equivalent. Boys often heard ""pansy,"" ""sissy,"" ""faggot,"" or worse. My son is going to get labeled anyway (already has been, when he was called ""gay""), with the intent of horrible degradation. At least now he can attempt to correct his peers and have a chance to educate them by saying, ""I'm not gay; I'm gender creative.""No, of course it won't stop the insults. But it gives him a positive rebuttal for people who try and define him until he knows what his sexuality will look like. He has already defined himself, and no one can remove that positive label from him with their negative critiques.Also, and more importantly, before my son knew about the trans, gender non-conforming, gender creative population, he felt alone and sad. He has always been anxiety-laden and felt like he didn't fit in, but he began spiraling downward, fast, in 4th grade. I showed him videos and photos of kids like Corey Maison, Jazz Jennings, CJ of ""Raising My Rainbow,"" and other kids who identify as trans or gender creative. He had seen several of these kids before, but now it really resonated.He watched and listened, and just as it was for me when I realized, I watched him have the lightbulb moment when he realized that there are kids out there just like him. Of his own assertion, after being exposed to different types of kids in documentaries and books, he ended up stating, ""I am gender creative!""It was a moment of huge relief for him to suddenly know he was not on an island, and he had people to identify with. He began asking me to start up a gender creative playgroup, where he could be free to play with My Little Pony and princess costumes all he wanted in a judgment-free zone, and maybe, even with like-minded people. I made a promise to him that I would, and I'm happy to say that the S.E.A.R.CH. program (Safe Environment for the Acceptance of Rainbow CHildren*) is starting this summer.So about labels -- if they are something that gives a kid hope, comfort, positive associations, and a rebuttal towards hurtful comments, then I'm fine with labels. Sometimes labels are not only helpful but absolutely necessary when trying to get a child the educational, medical, psychological, and/or legal services or protections that they're entitled to. My husband and I are totally following our son's lead on this, and we have always been honest with him about the hateful people out there. He knows. And yet he still chooses to be himself. I thought I would spare him the hateful comments that have been thrown our way now more than ever. But I ended up sharing one with him, so that he would know what some people are saying, and he’d hear it from me and not someone else. I told him of a few comments where I was labeled a “bad parent.”My son’s response? His jaw dropped, he stared at me for a minute before saying, “May I have permission to curse?” to which I hesitantly said, “Um...yes,” and he answered, without hesitation, “THOSE. LITTLE. BITCHES.” I couldn't help but laugh it off, and so did he. But he continued to shake his head and say, “Bad mom? That’s just insane.” The point remains the pieces I published accomplished exactly what our family wanted, and that was to start a dialogue about why we're so afraid of differences. Whether the gender spectrum is understood or not, embraced or hated, people are talking about it, and that's exactly what needs to happen in our country right now. It's time to break down gender stereotypes. Maybe then we can begin to see our LGBTQ community and our gender non-conforming people as equals. We have come a long way, but there's still a much longer way to go.

And earlier, this one, in the Voices section: ""When Your 4th Grade Son is Called 'Gay.'"" Today was our shoe shopping day. My 10-year-old needed shoes badly, as his big toe had finally pushed through the few strands of fabric that were holding the toe cap together for the past two months.I took my son to the shoe store we've been going to for years. Only this time, as I made my way left to the boys section, my son departed and went confidently to the right, to the girls section. That was a shoe store first, so I followed his lead.He knew exactly what he was getting, and when the announcement came over the speaker that it was “buy-one-get-one-half-priced day,” he knew exactly which two pairs he was getting. The first pair was pink, sparkly, glittery, shimmery, and they lit up. The second pair was pink, sparkly, glittery, shimmery, and they lit up. The only difference was one had velcro; the other had laces.These were most definitely feminine-looking shoes. Coincidentally, this particular line of shoes was called “Twinkle Toes.” If memory serves, this was a name hurled as an insult towards more effeminate boys when I was his age.I reminded my son that these shoes would also serve as his new school sneakers for the fall.“I know,” he said with a smile, unfazed.I said, “Well, at least make sure you look around the store before making a final decision.”He indulged me by pirouetting his eyes around the store without moving his body. Then he said, “I’m good.”At this point, I didn’t even know what I was concerned about, because he carried a girl’s backpack to school every day this past year and has already worn a dress in public and girl’s pajamas to school on pajama day. I guess it was just one more step towards independence that made me nervous.Just to be certain, though, I walked him over to the boy aisle, showed him a random pair of sneakers and said, “Do you like these?”“Nope,” he responded swiftly. “Too manly.”I didn’t think anymore and just responded, “Alrighty then, Twinkle Toes it is.”He also picked out several neon, hot pink, purple, and yellow ankle socks before we checked out, and when all was said and done, we left with two new pairs of shoes and four pairs of good quality socks for under $100 -- a rare occasion when it comes to athletic footwear.As soon as we got into the car, he peeled off his old blue sneakers, delicately placed the new shoes on his feet, looked down in admiration, took a photo, and posted it to Instagram, hashtag: “SPARKLES!”I smiled when I saw how happy he looked. Out of curiosity, I asked him, “Why haven’t you picked shoes from the girl’s aisle before today?”He answered, “Just like with the toys -- I didn’t realize that I could!”I felt both a sense of guilt and frustration -- guilt because, duh? Why did I assume he would generalize the “gender neutral toy/costume rule” in our house automatically to shoes as well?I felt frustration, because why can’t all kids just shop for shoes all in the same section? Shoes, even more so than clothing choices, should be gender neutral. Girls can wear Converse and Doc Martens and combat boots with no issue. Why can’t boys’ shoes also come in pink or glitter? But I forgot my brain tangent when I looked back at him and he was kicking his feet up in the air, a huge smile of exhilaration spread across his face. I wanted to remember this moment, so I pointed my phone in his direction and captured it.We had some errands to run after shoe shopping, so we did them with my son proudly wearing his loud, light-up, sparkly, girly shoes. He even leaped a few times between sidewalks and curbs. I was witnessing sheer happiness and freedom. I was witnessing a rockstar. A rockstar in twinkle toe sneakers. I have some pretty amazing people in my life who I must thank profusely for their concern over the hateful or negative comments we received following my other published pieces. As expected, many of them have been pointed in our family's direction regarding our support of raising a gender creative boy. I want to assure all my lovely friends that despite a world of misunderstanding and sometimes even hatred, we're good. I'm a theatre person who has been picked apart by directors most of my life. A few negative comments on social media will not discourage or sway me to stop talking about this important, ignored ""white elephant in the room."" We can no longer to afford to call effeminate young boys names like, ""sissy,"" ""pansy,"" ""gay,"" ""fag,"" or worse. This is an epidemic that has got to stop. There's nothing inherently wrong with words typically associated with femininity, but when those words are used as weapons, as the lowest possible form of male mockery, or to label a kid who doesn't even have sexuality on his or her radar yet, it's absolutely not okay. In fact, it's sexual harassment, and as such, falls under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX is further clarified by this letter issued in 2010, from the Office of Civil Rights, stating, ""Harassment does not have to include intent to harm, be directed at a specific target, or involve repeated incidents."" So, despite what is taught in schools, and contrary to the belief of many folks, harassment does not even have to happen more than once for it to be considered harassment. I'm actively choosing to focus instead on all the love that has surrounded us. It truly is overwhelming. Receiving messages from people all over the U.S. and even Canada who have reached out to say, ""My child is gender creative, too"" has been incredibly heart-warming. I've heard from grown people who were bullied all throughout childhood -- by family, friends, or both. I've heard from parents of gender creative or trans children who, just like me, are looking to connect. In this age of online social media, my son has even gained an old-fashioned, letter-writing pen pal, the gender creative young son of a family I've met on this parenting journey. Some have reached out, acknowledging the need to continue the conversation that gender expression and/or creativity is nothing new. Perhaps the lingo and terminology are new components, but strongly effeminate young boys and strongly masculine young girls, or any combination thereof, have always been around. Everyone can probably remember at least one from his or her childhood. For every one that we can remember, there were probably twice as many that we were unaware of, who were forced into hiding. Like the boys who were shamed by family or peers, told to ""man up,"" or to ""quit being a mama's boy"" -- or girls who were asked with raised eyebrows, ""you play football?"" or, aside comments made and murmured to ""go easy on her.""  Gender creative people have been around forever. Just one example lies within Native Americans, who have “Two-Spirited” people in their tribes. Two-Spirited people are said to encompass both genders and often are the most revered people in their culture. So, despite hate speech, people who refuse to understand, or outcries that parents like me are merely “virtue-signaling” on social media, I will keep fighting for equal rights, because I want a better world for my children.Among the comments, though, were a few recurrent questions, the same questions I've been hearing for years, so they're easy to answer and hopefully can attempt to clear up confusion for people who are interested in understanding. The first most common question is always some form of:Q). ""But how does your husband/his dad feel about this?"" A). I guess some people assume a father figure could not possibly agree to raising a gender creative son. However, I'm happy to report that my husband of nearly 20 years is 100 percent supportive of raising all three of our children exactly as they are. This includes: our oldest, cisgender*, straight, male son; our middle, cisgender*, straight, female daughter; and our youngest, gender creative* male son. We can't determine his sexual preference or gender identity yet (cisgender or transgender). We can only go with what he's telling us, and that's that he is ""happy being a boy"" but ""just likes all 'girly' things."" While at first it was a little unnerving for my husband to see his son not grow out of this supposed ""phase,"" he quickly realized, ""this is what makes him happy, he's not hurting anyone, and that's really all that matters."" The next most common question/comment we get is some form of:Q). ""That's all fine and good, as long as you're being honest with your son, and being truthful about how hard of a time he's going to have, getting bullied and all...""A). First, we are all about honesty. We have lots of ""family meetings."" Pretty much any conversation topic is fair game. But honestly, we haven't really even had to have many of those conversations with our son about how ""tough it's going to be,"" because he has already been experiencing weird looks, rude comments, and intrusive questions his whole life. He doesn't know any other reality. Fourth grade was his hardest year yet, probably because it's the beginning of puberty and thus the beginning of social exclusions that come with kids searching for their unique identities. I have always been open about my son's gender creativity, even when he was young and I was searching for resources and support. I'm just speaking from a somewhat bigger platform now. But I didn't begin to speak from a bigger platform until I asked my son if he was okay with it. He was not only okay with it, but was enthusiastic about it. He wants his story told. So that's what I attempt to do. To address the second part of this concern... saying, ""okay, but he's going to have to accept being bullied..."" well, that's straight up victim-blaming, and victim-blaming is never okay.The third most common question we get is some form of: Q). ""But why the need to label? Can't kids just be kids?""A). In my experience raising three of them, no, because that's not the way it tends to work with kids. Kids are going to get labeled regardless, typically by one another. For kids who are gender different or non-conforming, those labels can be life-crushing. Before our society had the term ""gender creative,"" the common label was ""tomboy"" for girls, and for boys... well, there was no friendly equivalent. Boys often heard ""pansy,"" ""sissy,"" ""faggot,"" or worse. My son is going to get labeled anyway (already has been, when he was called ""gay""), with the intent of horrible degradation. At least now he can attempt to correct his peers and have a chance to educate them by saying, ""I'm not gay; I'm gender creative.""No, of course it won't stop the insults. But it gives him a positive rebuttal for people who try and define him until he knows what his sexuality will look like. He has already defined himself, and no one can remove that positive label from him with their negative critiques.Also, and more importantly, before my son knew about the trans, gender non-conforming, gender creative population, he felt alone and sad. He has always been anxiety-laden and felt like he didn't fit in, but he began spiraling downward, fast, in 4th grade. I showed him videos and photos of kids like Corey Maison, Jazz Jennings, CJ of ""Raising My Rainbow,"" and other kids who identify as trans or gender creative. He had seen several of these kids before, but now it really resonated.He watched and listened, and just as it was for me when I realized, I watched him have the lightbulb moment when he realized that there are kids out there just like him. Of his own assertion, after being exposed to different types of kids in documentaries and books, he ended up stating, ""I am gender creative!""It was a moment of huge relief for him to suddenly know he was not on an island, and he had people to identify with. He began asking me to start up a gender creative playgroup, where he could be free to play with My Little Pony and princess costumes all he wanted in a judgment-free zone, and maybe, even with like-minded people. I made a promise to him that I would, and I'm happy to say that the S.E.A.R.CH. program (Safe Environment for the Acceptance of Rainbow CHildren*) is starting this summer.So about labels -- if they are something that gives a kid hope, comfort, positive associations, and a rebuttal towards hurtful comments, then I'm fine with labels. Sometimes labels are not only helpful but absolutely necessary when trying to get a child the educational, medical, psychological, and/or legal services or protections that they're entitled to. My husband and I are totally following our son's lead on this, and we have always been honest with him about the hateful people out there. He knows. And yet he still chooses to be himself. I thought I would spare him the hateful comments that have been thrown our way now more than ever. But I ended up sharing one with him, so that he would know what some people are saying, and he’d hear it from me and not someone else. I told him of a few comments where I was labeled a “bad parent.”My son’s response? His jaw dropped, he stared at me for a minute before saying, “May I have permission to curse?” to which I hesitantly said, “Um...yes,” and he answered, without hesitation, “THOSE. LITTLE. BITCHES.” I couldn't help but laugh it off, and so did he. But he continued to shake his head and say, “Bad mom? That’s just insane.” The point remains the pieces I published accomplished exactly what our family wanted, and that was to start a dialogue about why we're so afraid of differences. Whether the gender spectrum is understood or not, embraced or hated, people are talking about it, and that's exactly what needs to happen in our country right now. It's time to break down gender stereotypes. Maybe then we can begin to see our LGBTQ community and our gender non-conforming people as equals. We have come a long way, but there's still a much longer way to go. Hurtful comments and actions from other kids (and even some adults) who don't understand can hurt someone like my son, because they're young and don't have a lifetime of experience or extremely thick skin yet. But even in the face of that, with our encouragement at home (and I do mean encouragement from our whole family -- me, his two siblings, and his dad, who is probably his biggest cheerleader), our son continues to live happily -- exactly as himself. *Cisgender: A person whose self-identity conforms with the gender that corresponds to their biological sex.

Jay Z raps on 1996's ""Reasonable Doubt,"" his groundbreaking debut album about the story of a hustler and a rapper on the rise. Two decades later, his lyrics continue to reverberate in the voices of some of today's top artists -- Rihanna and Kanye West, for example -- having permanently altered the fabric of rap music history. Saturday marks the 20th anniversary of ""Reasonable Doubt,"" and to celebrate the album's legacy Jay and Roc-A-Fella Records co-founder Kareem “Biggs” Burke have collaborated on a unique fan experience to bring it back to where it all began: APT 4B. Taking its name from Jay Z's 1990s apartment in the Marcy Projects, the Los Angeles pop-up concept shop modeled after the rapper's old digs will play home base to ""Reasonable Doubt"" T-shirts, hats cassettes, and more, as well as pieces from Burke's denim line Fourth of November. Fans will also be able to interact with kiosks featuring exclusive content and get a peek at ""Reasonable Doubt""-inspired emojis to bridge the gap between generations of rap lovers. ""The partnership between Biggs and I began in the spirit of independence 20 years ago and nothing has changed,"" Jay Z said in a statement. ""For the pop-up shop series, we're working directly with store owners, supporting entrepreneurship in our communities. The shops bring to life the inspiration behind 'Reasonable Doubt'; the fans and respecting the culture.""The occasion signals a new beginning for Biggs, as Roc-a-Fella's other founders, Jay Z and Damon Dash, have largely dominated the conversation about the record label's origin story. When discussing the trajectory of a company with humble beginnings, Biggs describes himself as a ""proud father,"" connecting the dots between artists of today and the movement he started all those years ago. ""It all goes back to the genesis of what we did 20 years ago."" Burke told The Huffington Post. ""If you think about the 'Reasonable Doubt' family tree ... we introduced Kanye [West] to the market, who in turn, introduced GOOD Music. J. Cole, Rihanna, Pusha T and Rihanna --- a lot of careers have come out of where we started.""The shop opens Saturday, June 25, and will remain open through July.

The strangest thing I've ever seen.""It's not known why this took two months to grab any media attention, but that sometimes happens with dubious UFO stories.According to The Daily Mail, the ""bizarre black ring-shaped UFO"" sparked theories of an ""alien portal"" -- Hawkins' alien portal reference wasn't exactly a theory -- and that ""a conspiracy theorist said it would cause families to worry of an alien invasion.""Really? It's time for some clarification.One commenter to the Daily Mail story wrote: ""LOL. People are funny with their conspiracy theories. You'll see that ring every night that Disney does the World of Color show.""And this brings us closer to the truth.A 2015 NBC News story examined many cases where identical black, hovering smoke rings resulted from the use of pyrotechnics.""Creating smoke vortices generally requires a blast through a circular structure -- perhaps from a factory smokestack, or a homemade trash-can smoke ring launcher, or a hippie-dippie apparatus specially designed for the job,"" according to NBC.To put the icing on the cake, here's what we're talking about:Everybody knows how much pyrotechnics are a huge part of the magic of the Disney theme parks.Sorry to disappoint the conspiracy buffs who might have hoped for portals to another dimension.

With 7 family members residing in an average household which has no electricity or running water, children and adolescents acquire a multitude of domestic responsibilities at an early age. Due to most families having to rely on their small plots of land for survival, sending a teenager to secondary school is not only a financial burden, but also leads to a reduction in their household's productivity.

Without a secondary education young adults are forced to take on adult responsibilities and with these responsibilities comes a lifestyle. Female teenagers are particularity vulnerable and often enter transactional relationships where they exchange sex for material goods and then fall pregnant at an early age.I met Helen Salaamu in 2013 in Uganda's capital, Kampala. I was with One Village's education co-coordinator Paul at the time. When I met her she was distressed and crying because she was scared about not being able to find employment as a primary school teacher and what that would mean for her family. Paul reassured Helen and made her feel better about her future. After meeting Helen who was 19 at the time I was told about the adversities she had faced. When Helen was in her final year of primary school she lost both of her parents and became the breadwinner for her two younger brothers. Helen worked tirelessly on a small plot of land to grow vegetables that she could sell to pay for her school fees. Due to Helen's young age, older family members often stole the small amount of money she would save and on multiple occasions they would physically abuse her. After being sent home countless times for failing to pay for school, one concerned teacher from St. Peter High School counselled Helen and learnt about her journey. After receiving support from the community for secondary school fees Helen excelled at high school. When she graduated from secondary school she was awarded a One Village Scholarship to attend Primary Teachers College, which paid for her tuition fees, scholastic materials and living requirements. Today Helen works full time as a primary school teacher and has purchased land so that she can sell produce to supplement her income to ensure that she can send her two younger brothers to school. Her youngest brother is in his final year at high school and her other brother is studying computer sciences. Once her brothers have finished study and found work Helen plans to undertake postgraduate studies so she can become a university lecturer. Receiving a secondary and tertiary education is the reason Helen escaped the cruel realities of poverty. Her education meant she avoided entering transactional relationships and now has an income to support herself and family members. This is why One Village believes education is the most effective way to empower younger people so that they can create change and development within their own communities. Helen's story is one of many positive anecdotes about the impact a One Village scholarship has had on the lives of the people in the rural of Uganda, Namwendwa.

Mr Trump arrived to officially open his golf resort which has undergone an eight month refurbishment as part of an investment thought to be worth in the region of two hundred million pounds. (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb81aed3c000018010dbaa3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shortly after Tim Kaine had been elected Governor of Virginia in 2006, a discussion ensued among Democratic party leaders about the lessons that could learned from Kaine's victory. Some observations were interesting, others were not. One was particularly off the mark.Because Kaine had often spoken about his Catholic faith, and because Democrats ordinarily do not, some concluded that the lesson to learn from Kaine's win was that Democrats needed to make a point of speaking more about religion. The observation was correct -- Kaine did speak about his faith; but the conclusion was wrong.Kaine is not your ordinary politician. He is soft-spoken and thoughtful. Never one for bluster or stilted speechifying, his style is easy going and conversational. He is also a Catholic who speaks comfortably about how his sense of morality and his commitment to serving those in need comes from the social gospel message of the bible and his experience as a volunteer worker in Latin America sponsored by the Jesuits. Over the next several months, I noted that one of the Democrats who had been influenced by this discussion began to speak, rather awkwardly, about his religious beliefs. At one point, having winced one too many times at his clumsy efforts to talk about his faith, I approached him and said ""You have it all wrong. Tim Kaine didn't win because he spoke about religion. He won because he is authentic. And because he really is influenced by his faith. When he speaks about it, it's real and people can feel that. When you speak about religion, it's not real and it just doesn't work. Be authentic, don't fake it.""This same dynamic was at work during this year's Democratic primary. To his credit, Bernie Sanders never faked it. He was compelling when he spoke about his immigrant father and the values he learned growing up in a working class immigrant home. When he was asked during a televised debate about his religious beliefs, he didn't attempt to fake it. Instead he spoke about his ""spirituality"" -- his belief that we are all connected to one another and, therefore, responsible to care for each other. It was moving and authentic. And because it was real, it registered well with the audience.I thought about this matter of religion in politics this past week, when I read news accounts of Donald Trump's meeting with a group of leading Christian Conservatives. Originally planned as a small ""get acquainted"" session, the event grew to over one thousand people. Since the Christian right represents almost 40 percent of the Republican electorate, the meeting was important. Trump needed their support.Trump apparently knew his limitations. He didn't even try to convince the assembled religious leaders about his faith. At one point he spoke clumsily about the importance of sending children to Sunday school and at another he mentioned ""when I used to go to church"" implying that he no longer does.But none of this mattered to the assembled leaders. They are a self-righteous group who believe that they alone are in possession of God's truth. Instead of their political beliefs flowing from their faith, they attempt to give their conservative politics a religious coloration. They weren't interested in Trump's religion, what they wanted to know was that would endorse their political agenda. And he did, promising to appoint anti-abortion judges and to change the law that currently limits the ability of tax-exempt religious institutions from becoming directly involved in politics (which Trump endorsed saying ""I think maybe that will be my greatest contribution to Christianity"").  Though awkwardly phrased, Trump was direct in his appeal ""You can pray for your leaders, and I agree with that -- pray for everyone -- but you really have to do is you have to pray to get everyone out to vote for one specific person"" -- obviously meaning himself, Donald Trump. Not satisfied with this crass appeal for votes, Trump went further questioning Hillary Clinton's faith. ""We don't know anything about Hillary Clinton in terms of religion... she's been in the public eye for years and years and yet there's nothing out there.""That, of course, is sheer nonsense since it is well known that Clinton is deeply committed to her Christian faith. She often quotes scripture and her most genuine moments have been when she speaks about it. Coincidentally, I had just received a letter from a friend, an evangelical Christian leader, who told me that he had gone to high school with Clinton and how she had been a youth leader in the Methodist Church. He recalled her decades-long relationship with her pastor on whom she had relied for spiritual guidance.In the end, it wasn't faith or the lack of it that mattered for the assembled Christian Conservatives. In reality, they were not embracing Trump for his religion or his authenticity. More likely, they suspended their disbelief, simply because they had come to accept that he would advance their earthly goals.Follow @AAIUSA for more."
33,ARTS,Art-House Summer Films Not to be Missed,"Isaac Zablocki, ContributorDirector of Film Programs, JCC Manhattan, ReelAbilities Film F...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arthouse-summer-films-not_b_10662162.html,,2016-06-25,2016-06-24-1466800824-6833133-Indignation_poster.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-24-1466800824-6833133-Indignation_poster-thumb.jpg,"Summer is associated with big movies and outdoor screenings. Beyond the blockbusters that hit theaters every summer, it is also the season for breakthrough art-house films that try their luck at creating buzz and reaching film fans that still appreciate quality storytelling and human drama beyond big special effects. In the competitive film market, art-house films often get overlooked. They open with little fanfare and are never discovered by the mainstream. Fabulous movies will quickly disappear to the dusty shelves of VOD and do not get the attention they deserve.   Art-house films open doors for more diverse, progressive visions that Hollywood still has not caught up with. The beauty is when these films reach beyond their niche and relate on the mass level. The classic example of a small independent film that delighted the summer box office beyond the niche is My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Despite being a story about a specific minority, it had a universal appeal that delighted a wide audience.   More recently, Presenting Princess Shaw is another example of a film that can potentially speak beyond its obvious niche. This gem had a short run in New York theaters and is a universal documentary, a fairytale of the internet age that celebrates connections in the age of the internet. It follows the Israeli musician Kutiman, who remixes songs from found recordings on the internet. When he discovers incredible music of a down-on-her-luck dreamer who goes by the name Princess Shaw, both their lives are forever changed. Despite Magnolia Pictures and Participant Media being behind this remarkable movie, it received a small theatrical release and was missed by audiences. You do not have to be a fan of YouTube remixes to connect with the story of following your dreams and friendship in a modern disconnected world. Anyone can relate.  The Jewish Niche is a huge market. According to the Jewish Film Presenters Network, there are over 200 Jewish film festivals throughout America - a market with great impact. This is a film-loving audience that is not afraid of challenging material or subtitles. A diverse and impactful community that appreciates the communal experience of film. And best of all, it is a well-organized community that knows how to get the word out.   This summer, JCC Manhattan is presenting a slew of fantastic films that reach beyond the niche. Opening in theaters this week is Septembers of Shiraz by Wayne Blair which tells the story of a Jewish family in Iran just as the revolution starts in 1979. It's based on a NY Times bestselling novel and boasts an impressive cast including Adrian Brody and Salma Hayek. The story of victims of the revolution has been told in film (most recently in Argo) but this film allows a more personal perspective to be appreciated. Through the story of one family, the drama is made relevant and reminds us of the power of love and the importance of family ties.   Releasing in July by Kino-Lorber is The Tenth Man from Daniel Burman, the acclaimed director of Lost Embrace. This film follows the son of a major Jewish community foundation leader in Buenos Aires creating a thrilling and entertaining story that engages the audience by taking us into this unique community. Burman is a true talent and creates a visual experience that is like no other.   Most anticipated is James Schamus' adaptation of the Philip Roth novel Indignation. Although hardly Roth's most known book, this Sundance favorite is one of the best adaptations of his novels and captures much of the essence of Roth's work. In many ways, this story goes back to Roth's roots and paints a captivating picture of the changing America of the 1950s. The film follows a hyper-intelligent young Jewish man from Newark, attending a Christian college in Ohio. In the shadow of the Korean War, his intellectual, emotional and sexual awakenings challenge the politics of the time. This rich movie not only captures the period with beautiful visuals and brilliant acting and dialogue, but also manages to find a way to make the story timely and relatable to all. Beyond the innocence of youth, the film is a philosophical and ethical journey that speaks to any evolving person. The presentation is meticulous and the dialogue manages to not only transport the audience into a different time, but to make the 1950s approachable even for those who did not live then. It speaks in almost a timeless fashion. This film is a great example of when visual effects are replaced by strong dialogue.   Another fascinating film is The People vs. Fritz Bauer by Lars Kraume (released by Cohen Media Group). This German film tells the story of the prosecutor who brought the Nazi war crimes committed in Auschwitz to justice by the German court. A different perspective on these groundbreaking trials was recently presented by Sony Pictures Classic's release of Labyrinth of Lies. This often forgotten piece of history contends with Germany's post-war trauma and the general tone of the time.   All of these films have more to offer than the superhero movies that seem to be flooding our theaters. I believe that art-house films drive us to create a more ethical society and truly bring the impact of film to the public. Help support these visions and take a break from binge watching or the latest blockbuster for thoughtful cinematic experiences."

37,IMPACT,What Can Brexit And Trump Teach Design?,"Soren Petersen, ContributorDesign Research Ph.D.; Author, 'Profit from Design'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-can-brexit-and-trump_b_10674656.html,"Friday morning we all woke up to a world that had literally changed over night.

Having arrived in Copenhagen from my home in Los Angeles the night before, and suffering from jet lag, I closely followed the election into the early morning. When I finally went to bed, all the prognosticators declared that the UK would remain in the European Union. When I woke up the next morning the reality was very different.The British had decided to leave the European Union to unilaterally design their own future. No longer would they collaborate closely with the remaining twenty-seven European countries, taking other's concerns into consideration. This was a decision, which to a large extent was guided by emotions rather than reason. What can our politicians, business people and problem solvers alike learn from this earth-shattering event?The Brexit election exposed, without a doubt, a chasm between the European intellectual elite and the common man. In a dictatorship, these groups' misperceived differences in interests are suppressed; however in a democracy the consequences eventually bite everybody in the butt during elections. The Brexit and Trump phenomenon provide vivid current examples of this divide. As Shakespeare said: ""Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.""As in all types of businesses, whether it is a company, government or any other form of organization that provides solutions, losing touch with one's users, quickly results in a dramatic decline in market shares. Recent examples of this are Nokia, the East German Communist party and the Catholic Church. What these institutions failed to consider was not just physical needs, even more importantly, they failed to address emotional needs.In the case of Brittan, the politicians failed to address half of the population's need for feeling included, having pride and trusting that their world was going in the right direction. American politicians are now failing to address the very same fundamental human needs.The most frustrating thing is that these catastrophic events are not Acts of God; they are man made and therefore preventable. The first step of basic Design Thinking is to understand the users in the field, not sitting in one's ivory tower or 'think tank' and making things up.Intellectually, the British and American elite know that over the past decades the gap in wealth between the top one percentile and everyone else has increased. They may also see that technological development has divided people into those with and those without a future. However, there is a huge difference between knowing and understanding.Innovation providers, such as designers and engineers, have, in decades past, invested heavily in ""walking a mile"" in their user's shoes and not just reading technical specifications from marketing. This has provided us all with a wide range of amazing opportunities, - think Ebay, Facebook, Uber and Airbnb. In contrast to our politicians, their leaders, managers and development teams are directly, immediately and personally responsible and accountable for the outcome.When was the last user-centered, innovative and truly well designed solution seen from politicians? As an old Viking family saying goes: ""If you cannot hear you will have to feel!"" On Friday, it may be that the European elite and its politicians felt what the American politicians have yet to feel."
