2,WELLNESS,Egg Yolks: As Bad as Smoking? About That Study...,"Dr. Jonny Bowden, Contributor
Ph.D., C.N.S.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/egg-yolks-health_us_5b9c33b1e4b03a1dcc7d0cca,"The idea that a food that contains 13 essential vitamins and minerals, high-quality protein, antioxidants, and brain-supporting choline should have almost as bad an effect on the heart as a pack of Salems just doesn't pass the smell test, even if your nose is clogged.",2012-08-29,"BERLIN, GERMANY - JANUARY 05: In this photo illustration an egg yolk falls out of its shell on January 5, 2011 in Berlin, Germany. German authorities across the country are on high alert following the disclosure that the animal feeds company Harles and Jentsch GmbH sold large quantities of dioxin-tainted animal feed to poultry and hog farmers. Authorites in Lower Saxony have halted eggs and meats shipments from 1,000 farms as a precaution, and consumer groups have warned the public against eating eggs for the time being. (Photo Illustration by Andreas Rentz/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c33b12400003100531c42.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Oh brother, here we go again.This month, the journal Atherosclerosis published a study examining the association between the number of egg yolks consumed per week and the amount of plaque in the carotid artery. The study concluded that eating egg yolks is almost as bad as smoking when it comes to speeding up plaque deposits.OK, everyone, relax and take a deep breath.The idea that a food that contains 13 essential vitamins and minerals, high-quality protein, antioxidants, eye-health-supporting carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) and brain-supporting choline should have almost as bad an effect on the heart as a pack of Salems just doesn't pass the smell test, even if your nose is clogged. And it doesn't begin to jibe with previous research. But that's just the beginning.People who know my work have heard me rail time and time again against drawing conclusions from what are known as observational studies, of which this is a prime example. If you're new to my column, here's the difference between clinical study (which this is most definitely not) and an observational one. It's an important difference, and it's essential to understanding why the present study is not only horrible science, it's also useless.What Exactly Is An ""Observational Study""?In an observational study from which many associations are generated, you take a whole bunch of people -- thousands of them -- and you gather data about a zillion different things.Maybe it's blood pressure and cholesterol, maybe it's heart disease, maybe it's what they ate for breakfast, how often they brush their teeth, how many of their parents had diabetes, how many of them own television sets, practice the rumba, love Lady Gaga, take antidepressants, or pop a Centrum now and then.OK now you've got a statistician's version of heaven -- tons and tons of data. Eighty gazillion gigabytes of numbers from thousands of people, and it's your job to see if there's any pattern, to determine which things are ""associated"", meaning ""found together."" If two things are said to be associated (or correlated), that means there is some relationship between these two things.Get it?Of course, discovering that two things happen to be found together is only the first part of science. The second, important part is finding out why. Observational studies don't touch that question; they merely catalogue what's found together and leave it to the big boys to run the actual clinical studies and find out what the found association actually means (if anything).This study didn't even generate tons of data because they only looked at two -- count 'em, two -- variables. Smoking and egg yolk consumption. We'll come back to this in a minute.So this egg yolk study was an observational study, like all the other studies with weird and inexplicable ""results"" (e.g., taking a multivitamin will kill you). You cannot -- repeat, cannot -- attribute cause-and-effect to an observational study. All you can say is that it's been observed that two things are found together more frequently than might be by chance. You have no idea about why.(If you want to read a great story about the idiocy of drawing cause-and-effect conclusions from observational studies, read the following paragraphs. If you'd just as soon move on with the story, skip over the part about storks and babies.) Storks and Babies: A Short Tangent into Observational StudiesIn a certain region of Denmark, there is a correlation between the number of storks and the number of babies. Seriously. It's a positive correlation, meaning the more storks there are, the more babies there are. According to my old Psych 101 professor, Dr. Scott Fraser, this stork-baby correlation thing has held up for years.So. A classic observational study shows more storks, more babies. Less storks, less babies. What do we conclude?Well, here's what we do not conclude, unless of course, we're 3 years old: Storks bring babies. We might not know why the correlation occurs -- it's admittedly puzzling and amusing at the same time -- but we're pretty sure that it's not cause-and-effect.Dr. Fraser used this example back when I was in his psych class to introduce the concept of confounding variables. A confounding variable is one that is not measured directly, but that accounts for the relationship between the two things that were measured.See if you can find the ""confounding variable"" in the storks-babies correlation.Give up? Here's the answer to the puzzle. In Denmark, the cities are largely populated by singles and by childless couples. When people want to have kids, they move to the suburbs. In the suburbs of Denmark, the houses tend to be A frames with tar-based sloping roofs. Storks love to nest on tar and sloping roofs. The tar-based sloping roofs are the ""confounding"" variable. Both storks and newlyweds flock to the same area. Puzzle solved.Back to Egg YolksWhen statisticians do studies like this ""egg yolks kill"" study, they try to ""correct"" for the confounding variables by applying statistical techniques that nullify other potential influences, like age, sex, years smoking and all that other good stuff. But they can only ""control"" for the variables they think of. And they often don't think of precisely the variables that are making the difference, particularly when they already have a point of view about what the outcome is going to be. (It's called ""confirmation bias,"" and it's rampant in research.)In this study, for example, investigators claim to have statistically controlled for smoking, but they failed to control for overall lifestyle behavior. ""Can they truly statistically control for all health factors of smoking?"" asks Donald Layman, Ph.D. No, folks. They can't. They also didn't control for sugar intake, nor for omega-6 intake. (The high ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s in the Western diet is probably responsible for more heart disease than saturated fat ever was!) It gets worse. They also didn't control for exercise. Not only that, they completely failed to mention whether the ""high egg users"" were also the ""high smokers."" (Smoking is one of the biggest factors associated with increasing plaque area.) And did I mention that plaque generally increases with age? Subjects in the ""high egg consumption"" group had an average age of 69.7 years while subjects in the ""low egg consumption"" group were on average 12 years younger, with an average age of 55.7 years. But that's not even the best part.Buried at the end of the study is the finding that there was no association between cholesterol and plaque growth. Not total cholesterol, not LDL cholesterol not HDL cholesterol. None of them had any association with greater plaque. So if eating two extra eggs a week -- the difference between the ""low egg consumers"" and the ""high egg consumers"" -- is causing plaque growth, it's got to be by some other mechanism than the cholesterol in the eggs, since cholesterol wasn't associated with the reported plaque growth at all. Yet they claim that the reason they did the study in the first place is because there's reason to be concerned about the cholesterol in eggs!So let's review. In a very limited observational study of 1,200 people, researchers measured carotid artery thickness and then went back and examined data on two variables: smoking and egg yolk consumption. That's all, folks. And they found that people (average age 57) who ate about 2.75 eggs a week had less plaque growth than people (average age 69) who ate about 4.5 eggs a week. Plaque growth might also have been positively correlated with portions of asparagus eaten on Wednesdays or number of pitches thrown in a Little League game when the subjects were 9. Of course the researchers wouldn't have looked at any of that, because they wouldn't have thought it was relevant. And maybe it's not. But is sugar consumption? Omega-6 fat consumption? Lifestyle choices? Smoking? Age? The investigators didn't look at other ""suspects"" because they had already decided they had the guilty party.David Jenkins, one of the researchers on this paper, is a wonderful man, a very smart, gentle scholar who has made an enormous contribution to nutrition with his work on glycemic index. I questioned Dr. Jenkins after his presentation at the American College of Nutrition conference in New York in 2010, and it was abundantly clear that he was a strong believer in the cholesterol hypothesis and that he was deeply concerned about the growing trend towards looking at cholesterol as just a minor player in heart disease. For those of us who believe that the cholesterol hypothesis is just a myth, I'm sure he feels this study is a wake-up call. Unfortunately, this study is nothing of the kind. Sad to say, it's just really bad science and I'm honestly amazed that it got published at all.For more by Dr. Jonny Bowden, click here.For more healthy living health news, click here."

This is especially true if children are involved. Obviously, you can't just walk away and take care of yourself. It's important to minimize the negative effects that divorce will have on the children. The bottom line is that it's vital to regain your own psychological equilibrium to make sure your children can get through the process unscathed. You can't help your children if your own emotions are running wild.It's useful to understand that regardless of how objectively upsetting a situation might be, it's sometimes compounded by unhealthy reactions. So, just as the safety announcements on airplanes urge you to put on your own oxygen mask first, make sure you have the tools to change your negative responses so you can focus on also taking care of your children. Research shows that children thrive with ""attuned"" parents and falter with those who ignore or minimize their feelings. Divorce can knock anyone off kilter, so don't underestimate the negative effects that stress can have on you. Learn to manage your own reactions so that you can recognize when your children need comforting, and don't push them away or minimize their pain. Be available to let them talk about their feelings and deal with any confusion they may have.The need to regulate your own responses cannot be overstated. Your anger, depression or anxiety can cause lifelong problems for your children. Remember, just because negative reactions emerge does not make them true or useful. Self-help techniques can help you stay in control. You can find some in my book, Getting Past Your Past: Take Control of Your Life with Self-Help Techniques from EMDR Therapy. For instance, one adult client kept rehashing a fight. Another child client kept seeing his father angrily walk out the door for the last time. You can help yourself and your children get rid of distressing mental pictures by imagining it on top of paint in a can. Then, just stir it up. That disrupts ""working memory"" and makes it go away. You can also use other techniques to immediately change negative emotions or thoughts. This will empower both you and your children. It will also allow you to be present with your children and show enough happiness so they don't feel like they have to take care of you. No child deserves that burden.It's also vital that you make sure to let your children know they are not to blame for what happened. Carefully explain that this was an ""adult decision"" and while things will be different, they are still loved and that will never change. Emphasizing this and saying ""I love you"" are a vital part of what children need in order to recover their own equilibrium. Remember that children often take on blame for what goes on in their lives. It can haunt them for years in many ways and cause many emotional problems. For instance, in Getting Past Your Past I describe how personalities develop and different kinds of problems emerge. It includes many examples of how children were derailed by the actions of their parents, and how they took on guilt that didn't belong to them. EMDR therapy processing of the memories liberated them into a healthy life, but rather than allow problems to develop, it's important that you make sure your children feel free of personal blame for the divorce. That includes not putting them in the position of ""go-betweens"" or ""sounding boards"" for pain and anger. I can't tell you the number of adult children of divorced parents who report how painful it was to be in the middle, and how much it compromised their relationships with both parents. It's important for the parents to set appropriate boundaries and handle difficulties with each other while leaving the children out of it. If you have to vent, do it with a grown family member, friend or a therapist. But make sure it's in a location where the children can't hear. Otherwise, youngsters can carry the pain and confusion with them for years to come. If you notice that they have already been negatively affected, reach out for professional help. An EMDR specialist can help both you and your children to process the divorce as well as any negative experiences that led up to it so the memories can be digested and let go. Also consider, couples' therapy to help you and your ex part in the best possible way for the sake of the children.The bottom line is that our childhood experiences set the foundation for how we see the world. Make sure to stay attuned and available while maintaining your own emotional balance. Children can feel loved and nurtured whether in a one-home or two-home family, and that can set them on the path to a happy and productive future.Here is a list of tips to remember: 1. Tell children ""I love you"" and let them know that will never change.2. Let them know the divorce has nothing to do with them or anything they've ever done or been or could do.3. Make sure not to blame or demonize your ex. Don't put children in the middle or use them as go-betweens.4. Talk to your children about their feelings. Let them know it's okay and normal to feel sad, angry, confused, etc. Teach them ways to cope.5. Make sure they know that they can talk with their friends about their experiences and that they don't have to be silent or keep the divorce a secret.6. Plan fun activities to participate in with your children. 7. Plan fun activities with friends and family members to nurture yourself.8. Make sure you have the tools and techniques needed to handle your own emotions and stay attuned to your children.9. If things feel stuck, get yourself and/or your children therapy (like EMDR) to communicate and process the feelings.10.

So how do you go about fixing it?",2012-08-29,"FILE - In this March 5, 2012 file photo, consumer credit cards are posed in North Andover, Mass. The rate of severely late credit card payments dipped nationally in the first three months of the year, even as banks issued more cards to borrowers with less-than-stellar credit, according to an analysis by credit reporting agency TransUnion. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c31d61f000050002120ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Has your credit score taken a hit because of the Great Recession? Foreclosures, unemployment and other financial struggles have hurt a lot of people's credit history. So how do you go about fixing it? Here are five ways that you can start repairing your credit score: Organize and prioritize. Your main concern in rebuilding your credit is making sure every bill is paid on time. Sit down with your finances and find places where you can cut corners so that every bill is paid on or before the due date. Set up auto-pay for each credit card so you don't accidentally miss a payment. Your payment history is the largest percentage of your credit score, so it must be perfect going forward if you want to rebuild your credit. Negotiate down your debt. Many lenders understand that people have financial hardships and will work with you to pay down what you owe, whether it be setting up a payment plan or cutting you a deal if you pay it all at once. Focus on your credit cards, or any other ""revolving"" debt. Paying off mortgages, auto loans and other ""installment"" debts don't do as much for your score. Make sure you ask the borrower how they will be reporting your new terms to the credit bureaus. They can report them as ""Not paying as agreed,"" which can further hurt your score, or they can report them as ""Paying as agreed,"" which can help your score. Don't agree to any terms that are reported as ""not paying as agreed"" and make sure to get everything in writing. Don't close out accounts. It may seem like a good idea to close out your credit card accounts once you pay them off, but doing so can hurt your credit score. One of the main factors of your credit score is your ""credit utilization ratio,"" which measures your credit limit-to-balance ratio on your credit cards. So if you can keep these accounts and manage to maintain a low balance on them, this will help show that you know how to handle your credit.Get a secured credit card. If your credit score has taken a big hit, it might be impossible for you to be approved for any line of credit. If that's the case, look into getting a secured credit card. With secured cards, you pay an upfront deposit, which in most cases will reflect your credit limit, just in case you have issues paying off your balance. (If the deposit for the card is $300, your credit limit will likely be $300.) Make sure your secured card reports to all three of the credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) every month so that you can start building your credit again. We recommend the Capital One Secured Mastercard. Make sure any mistakes on your credit report are fixed. Check your credit report to make sure there are no mistakes or identity theft-related issues in your credit history. This also includes any negative information on your credit report that can be easily removed. Contest any negative information on your report from any company that no longer exists or has been bought by a larger company. All information on your report must be verified, and if the company isn't there to verify it, it must be removed. The most important factor in repairing your credit score is time. It takes seven years for most negative information to be taken off your report. Only you taking control of your own credit situation can repair your score.Jeff Hindenach started his career as a journalist for the San Jose Mercury News and the San Francisco Examiner.
