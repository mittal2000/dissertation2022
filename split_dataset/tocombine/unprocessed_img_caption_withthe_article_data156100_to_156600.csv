When people say that being a parent is the toughest job in the world, I think they may not have given teaching a hard and close enough look. Let's show these teachers some love!""Baking Your Teachers a Thank You ""is simple (I promise), and with a bunch of parents pitching in, it's a heartfelt way to show the school staff how much you value all they do for your kids (and if the baking is spread out over a bunch of families, it's an easy way to spread a lot of gratitude!).Here's what you do: Choose a recipe, either Big Fat Chocolate Chunk Cookies, Gingersnaps, or Chewy Sugar Cookies , or pick one of your own favorite recipes. Choose a day during National Teacher Appreciation Week (May 6-10), or any other day to designate as ""Bake Your Teacher a Thank You"" Day. If you are looking for extra help: two weeks before the date, send an email blast out to the parent body of your school, and asking for volunteer bakers. You may want to let people know how many volunteers you are looking for, based on the number of cookies you want to bring in. For a sample email, click here. Seven to 10 days before the designated date, send the selected recipe to the volunteer parents, along with instructions for dropping off the cookies at a determined spot the morning of Bake Your Teacher a Thank You Day. One to 2 days before the date, make sure you have a large cookie jar or two or three (depending on the size of your school). Print the cookie label for the selected cookie(s), with a list of ingredients. Attach the label(s) to the jar(s) with tape. The morning of Cookie Day, have a volunteer or two available to collect the cookies as they are dropped off in the designated spot, fill the jars with the cookies, and place them in the chosen spots where the teachers and staff can help themselves! Repeat as needed! This has been such a hit in our school that we quickly turned it into ""Cookie of the Month Day,"" and every month families from a different grade do the baking, so each grade is only asked to bake once a year.Pretty easy, right? And a lot of bang for your appreciation buck, I can tell you that. You can share your cookie photos on The Mom 100 wall on Facebook, comment at TheMom100.com, or post to Instagram, Twitter, or Pinterest using the #BakeAThankYou hashtag. Even email me the photos! I'm quite chatty so you'll likely hear back.Cookie recipes: Big Fat Chocolate Chip Cookies Chewy Sugar Cookies Gingersnaps"
1,WELLNESS,The Backward Step,"Tara Brach, Contributor
Clinical psychologist, meditation teacher and author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shift-perspective_us_5b9d0840e4b03a1dcc83e66a,"In practicing open awareness, I've found it helpful to think of existence -- the entire play of sounds and thoughts and bodies and trees -- as the foreground of life, and awareness as the background.",2013-05-01,Athlete training on steep old worn concrete stairs - toned image for dramatic feel. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d08401f0000510021744a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tibetan teacher Chögyam Trungpa once opened a class by drawing a V on a large white sheet of poster paper. He then asked those present what he had drawn. Most responded that it was a bird. ""No,"" he told them. ""It's the sky with a bird flying through it.""How we pay attention determines our experience. When we're in doing or controlling mode, our attention narrows and we perceive objects in the foreground -- the bird, a thought, a strong feeling. In these moments we don't perceive the sky -- the background of experience, the ocean of awareness. The good news is that through practice, we can intentionally incline our minds toward not controlling and toward an open attention.My formal introduction to what is often called ""open awareness"" was through dzogchen -- a Tibetan Buddhist practice. Until then, I'd trained in concentration and mindfulness, always focusing on an object (or changing objects) of attention. In dzogchen, as taught by my teacher Tsoknyi Rinpoche, we repeatedly let go of whatever our attention fixates on and turn toward the awareness that is attending. The invitation is to recognize the skylike quality of the mind -- the empty, open, wakefulness of awareness -- and be that.My first retreat with Tsoknyi Rinpoche loosened my moorings in a wonderful way. The more I became familiar with the presence of awareness, the weaker the foothold was for the feelings and stories that sustained my sense of self. Tensions in my body and mind untangled themselves, and my heart responded tenderly to whoever or whatever came to mind. I left that retreat, and later dzogchen retreats, feeling quite spacious and free.I more recently learned of the work of Les Fehmi, a psychologist and researcher who for decades has been clinically documenting the profound healing that arises from resting in open awareness.[1] In the 1960s researchers began to correlate synchronous alpha brain waves with profound states of well-being, peace, and happiness.Fehmi, an early and groundbreaking leader in this research, sought strategies that might deepen and amplify alpha waves. Experimenting with student volunteers, he tracked their EEG readings as they visualized peaceful landscapes, listened to music, watched colored lights, or inhaled various scents. But it was only after he posed the question, ""Can you imagine the space between your eyes?"" that their alpha wave levels truly soared. (Note: I'm offering a link to a guided meditation that I've adapted from Fehmi's work.)He posed another: ""Can you imagine the space between your ears?"" The subjects' alpha waves spiked again. Further experimentation confirmed the effects of what Fehmi termed ""open focused attention."" The key was inviting attention to space (or stillness or silence or timelessness) and shifting to a nonobjective focus.Narrowly focused attention affects our entire body-mind. Whenever we fixate on making plans, on our next meal, on judgments, on a looming deadline, our narrowed focus produces faster (beta) waves in the brain. Our muscles tense, and the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline are released. While necessary for certain tasks, as an ongoing state this stress constellation keeps us from full health, openheartedness, and mental clarity.In contrast, open-focused attention rests the brain. With a sustained pause from processing information -- from memories, plans, thoughts about self -- brain waves slow down into synchronous alpha. Our muscles relax, stress hormone levels are lowered, blood flow is redistributed. No longer in fight-or-flight reactivity, our body and mind become wakeful, sensitive, open, and at ease.You may have noticed the effect of open awareness when looking at the night sky and sensing its immensity. Or during the silence in the early morning before sunrise. Or when the world is still after a snowfall. We resonate with such moments because they connect us with the most intimate sense of what we are. We sense the depth of our being in the night sky, the mystery of what we are in the silence, the stillness. In these moments of objectless awareness there's a wordless homecoming, a realization of pure being.In practicing open awareness, I've found it helpful to think of existence -- the entire play of sounds and thoughts and bodies and trees -- as the foreground of life, and awareness as the background. In the Zen tradition, the shift from focusing on the foreground of experience to resting in pure being is called ""the backward step."" Whenever we step out of thought or emotional reactivity and remember the presence that's here, we're taking the backward step.If we wake up out of a confining story of who we are and reconnect with our essential awareness, we're taking the backward step. When our attention shifts from a narrow fixation on any object -- sound, sensation, thought -- and recognizes the awake space that holds everything, we're taking the backward step. We come to this realization when there is nowhere else to step. No anything. We've relaxed back into the immensity and silence of awareness itself.You might pause for a moment and receive this living world. Let your senses be awake and wide open, taking everything in evenly, allowing life to be just as it is. As you notice the changing sounds and sensations, also notice the undercurrent of awareness -- be conscious of your own presence.Allow the experience of life to continue to unfold in the foreground as you sense this alert inner stillness in the background. Then simply be this space of awareness, this wakeful openness. Can you sense how the experiences of this world continues to play through you, without in any way capturing or confining the inherent spaciousness of awareness? You are the sky with the bird flying through; you are, as a traditional Tibetan saying teaches:Utterly awake, senses wide open.Utterly open, nonfixating awareness.Adapted from True Refuge (2013)Enjoy this talk on Wise InvestigationFor more information visit: www.tarabrach.comFor more by Tara Brach, click here.For more on spiritual development, click here.References:[1] Fehmi, Les and Jim Robbins.

I thought I would take this moment to reflect on what we're doing together, and why.  In the wake of the Newtown shooting, President Obama called for a national conversation about mental health. But that conversation really begins in your home and your community, and it doesn't start and stop with individual tragedies. We will never know what exactly went wrong in the Lanza family. But we know that something did go terribly wrong, and that the family was so profoundly isolated that no one knew. Isolation, frustration, and hopelessness are the worst possible thing for mental illness.  And yet, this is the case with many kids and families in this country, and around the world. The violence is rare. But the suffering is there, every day, silent.  This May we are encouraging you to help start the conversation in your community by being a person who someone can feel comfortable talking to openly about a child who needs help. By being brave enough to be honest about your own worries and concerns. By being a person who makes other parents feel safe enough to speak up. A person who replaces stereotypes about mental illness with facts, who encourages people to try to get help.  We need resources and more specialists with expertise to make care more available. We need more and better research to create the treatments of tomorrow. But a lot of what we need starts with you and me, in our personal acceptance and honesty and openness in talking about mental illness with our families, our friends, and with other parents who may be struggling. That's why we call this month SPEAK UP FOR KIDS month.  I kicked off the Speak Up for Kids campaign with Cynthia McFadden at childmind.org/speakup on May 1st at 9 a.m. EST with a discussion about the barriers to children's mental health care and how we can overcome them, to make sure every kid has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential. That's just the beginning -- the message, the conversation and the issues will be raised all month long by leaders in the mental health care field, advocates, and families and kids who have struggled with mental illness. We hope you'll join us online to listen and learn but ultimately to speak up. We can't afford to be silent any longer.Just how outrageous are the roadblocks to children's mental health care?

The New York Post's Page Six reports Campbell and Doronin could be headed for a split after five years together. She is focusing on her show ""The Face,"" and he has allegedly been spotted flirting with other women in New York City. “Naomi and Vlad have a complex relationship, and sometimes break up and make up,"" a source told Page Six. “In many ways their relationship is like a business arrangement. Naomi brings glamor to his hotels and properties, and he treats her extremely well. But they spend a lot of time apart due to work commitments.”The Huffington Post reached out to Campbell's publicist for comment regarding the report of a possible split. Still, it is worth noting that there haven't been signs of any trouble brewing over the past few months. In March, the two looked content while on vacation in Miami. And back in November, Campbell threw Doronin a lavish 50th birthday party in India that made headlines around the world. The real estate mogul and the supermodel have been dating since 2008 -- although he is technically still married to his long-estranged wife, Ekaterina. But that doesn't seem to be an issue for Campbell, who has never been married before.""I am afraid of the word marriage,"" the 42-year-old told British GQ back in 2007. ""I'm afraid of making that commitment and failing because I never want to be divorced. I don't want divorce to enter my whole reality.""Even if her romance has fizzled, Campbell's career is still on fire. The British beauty covers the May 2013 issue of Vogue Brazil looking stunning with a mane of long blond hair.

They are the most important part of the equation. Pollan urges us to ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. And cook them."" Let's add three more words to that slogan -- ""with your kids.""",2013-05-01,A boy enjoying corn on the cob outside in the summer sunshine.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1e8c3c00004c000a0554.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"According to a 2010 UCLA study, the average American kid will be bombarded by almost 4,000 food commercials a year -- 95 percent of which promote unhealthy foods. Give a kid a choice between a carrot and a Cheeto and you know which will win. And no one needs a study (though there are plenty) to show the macro outcome of this bombardment: we're fatter (and by extension, sicker) than we've ever been. Michael Pollan offers a solution in his new book, Cooked. He's joined ""healthy eating"" revolutionaries, like Jamie Oliver, Laurie David and Mark Bittman, in calling us to the kitchen. Pollan wants us to cook to remember what it is to touch, smell, and KNOW our food. He's right, but my coda to his book would be: start with the kids. The most powerful antidote to the supremely marketed food that is engineered to make us want more is to get ourselves and, most importantly, our kids away from the television and into the kitchen -- peeling, squeezing, chopping, slicing and sizzling - with us. In a recent New York Times interview, Pollan suggested: ""Bring back home ec, but a gender-neutral home ec.""I agree, so long as Home Economics starts in preschool.There are nearly 50 million kids in the U.S. between the ages of three and fifteen. The best time to teach lifelong healthy eating habits is during their formative years. Exercise their natural curiosity, make a mess and experiment with new foods. Kids who participate in cooking their own food are far more likely to eat well. I've seen this transformation first hand. My children, both under the age of ten, once ate from a meal-wheel dominated by white pasta and pizza. Then we began a game. Who could eat the most colors in one meal? Next, we upped the stakes. Who could prepare a meal made solely of foods from the farmers' market (nothing from a box in the freezer or pantry)? The latter challenge led to meals easy enough for a five-year-old to make and delicious enough for the whole family to enjoy. Steamed artichokes with lemon butter, salsas and salads with fresh mango, jicama and rainbow carrots, and asparagus frittata -- to name a few. Now, every week my kids pick a new food to try and together, we cook. So long as I make it a game, they're game. The naysayers reading this are standing at the ready with arrows, and I know their arguments well (because I used to make them): it takes too much time to cook with kids. Parents are overwhelmed and busy. Kids in the kitchen make twice the mess, which takes twice the time to clean-up. A parent cooking alone, cooks fast!Those statements are true. But, consider this. Time ""wasted"" today is quality time gained later. As kids become more proficient in the kitchen, parents become more relaxed; the children will be able to take on more with less supervision. Stress levels sink. Instead of dinner being a scramble, you'll find that cooking together is an unmatched opportunity for family time together. The family time we need to fix this problem. I remember the exact moment when I realized our investment had paid off. I was standing in the frozen food aisle in late December, feeling dizzy about how I was going to host 12 guests for three non-stop days of holiday meals, and I suggested to my son, then six, that we pick up a few prepared foods to have ""as backup."" I reached into the freezer and his sweet little hand grabbed my arm. With a look of complete bewilderment he stated with a kindergartener's conviction, ""But Mommy, we don't eat anything from a box.""An added benefit to cooking as a family? Getting kids off the couch. They can't watch those 4,000 food commercials if they're in front of the stove. Children represent our biggest opportunity for change when it comes to food. They are the most important part of the equation. Pollan urges us to ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. And cook them."" Let's add three more words to that slogan -- ""with your kids.""

It's time to start thinking about family getaways. A unique proposition for single moms. We need to create vacations that allow us special time with our kids, but also activities that together everyone can independently enjoy. My daughter's grown and we're all very athletic so this month we chose to explore the hidden gems of water sport destinations worldwide. SURFING IN BUSUA, GHANA For the real adventurous, Busua, in the western region of Ghana, has some of the best undiscovered waves in the world. Remember the 1967 movie Endless Summer? That is what Ghana's beaches look like today, with the added bonus of warm water all year round. Accommodations vary. I suggest you try Fanta's Folly, a beautiful handcrafted ecolodge, very colorful and rustic. Or check into a treehouse or bungalow at The Hideout. While in Busua take a day trip to Dixcove or Butre. Each is a small fishing community with 17th century Dutch historical sights to visit. Take a guided tour through the rain forest, a canoe trip to Abokwa Island, try your hand at traditional farming or simply skateboard, kayak or snorkel. Contact Green Bug Adventures to arrange your family surf tour. You might even want to combine it with a voluntour day or a safariKITE SURFING/WINDSURFING DAKHLA, MOROCCO Where the desert meets the beach on the Atlantic coast of the Western Sahara sits the secluded Dakhla. It's a spit of sand sandwiched between a lagoon and the ocean 600 miles south of Marrakech. It is a wind-and kite-board surfing paradise with 365 days of sunshine a year and a near-constant breeze. The huge flat water of Dakhla lagoon offers ideal conditions for learning and improving your kitesurfing and windsurfing skills. It has been the host of the Annual KiteSurfing World Cup, bringing the best athletes from all over the world. For special family bonding live like a nomad at Dakhla Attitude, a Bedouin Tent Camp. Set up only a few meters from the water, nestled into the sand dunes they have modern luxuries like electricity and comfy beds. With this all-inclusive opportunity, meals are served buffet style in a long dining tent. You and your family can choose between a private two person or a shared tent (up to seven). If your family is not into vagabonding, the Calipau Sahara might suit your style: its got 43 bedrooms, an infinity pool and flat screen televisions.SNORKELING THE KOMODO ARCHIPELAGO, MALAYSIA How about packing up your snorkeling gear and heading off to Indonesia! The truth is my girlfriend Janet who lives in Malaysia is the one who convinced me to write this watercentric blog post in the first place. She was bragging about the superb reefs in Southeast Asia, and with 17,000 tropical islands to visit I agree; she is right. Southeast Asia is an ocean sport paradise. The Komodo Archipelago's abundance of hard and soft corals provides a Technicolor habitat for many of the great Pacific species of invertebrates and pelagics, including sharks, lionfish, rays and turtles. The great thing about snorkeling in Indonesia is the variety of options for the veterans and beginners alike. The waters sport some wild currents for the experienced snorkeler in search of adventure. On the other hand, tranquil bays abound, providing safe anchorage sites and fabulous snorkeling opportunities, especially for families. To make this destination easily accessible for families, Asia Transpacific Journeys offers personal, customized journeys, as well as small-group trips with local, experienced guides and unique, cultural and adventure experiences. Other activities can include cruising on traditional Indonesian schooner, whitewater rafting, traditional puppet-making, Balinese cooking classes, a local family home visit with dinner or bicycling to local markets. The dry season starts in late April or May, and is generally recommended as the best time to go. DIVING FORT MYERS & SANIBEL, FLORIDA Located in 90 feet of water, roughly 28 nautical miles off of Sanibel Island on Florida's southwest coast is the Coast Guard Cutter Mohawk. Still in full fighting trim, it offers an exceptional diving experience with the ship's replica guns, huge smokestack, crow's nest, bridge, deckhouse and massive propeller all accessible for exploration. Trained and equipped divers descend the smokestack into the Mohawk's enormous engine room to the giant engine's inner parts and reduction gear. Divers report many species of fish, sea turtles and bull sharks. And recently, wreck divers have spotted whale sharks, the world's largest living fish with a maximum size of about 65 feet. The World War II warship was deployed to its final resting on July 2, 2012. As a result, it created the first Veterans Memorial Reef in the area dedicated to all U.S. veterans. Staying at South Seas Island Resort will make for the perfect blend of an above- and below-the-water family getaway. Located at the northern end of Captiva Island, this iconic 330 acre resort village is situated on a wildlife preserve and features two-and-a-half miles of shell-laden beaches. South Seas was named one of the top 10 Beach Resorts for Families by Parent's Magazine."

Out of hundreds of entries, 51 8th graders from a dozen states received awards. My son, Zachary, an 8th grader at Poly Prep, in Brooklyn, was one of them. Of the eight winners from New York State, he was the only boy. In fact, there were only six boys in the entire country who were winners.I say this not as a proud parent (though I am) but as a concerned social scientist. Many concerned educators and media pundits have decried the ""boy crisis"" in schools -- the fact that girls are surpassing boys in college attendance (about 60 percent of entering first-year students this year are female), achievement (girls have caught up in science and math, and far outpace boys in English and language); and behaviors (boys are far more likely to be retained, suspended, diagnosed with ADHD and get into fights). But many of the proposed remedies for this crisis have little, if any, empirical foundation. Single-sex classes for white boys tend to flatten differences among boys and teach to stereotypes that are both insulting and limiting to boys. (Proponents imagine them as Dead Poets' Society, but they are just as likely to be Lord of the Flies.) There is some evidence that single-sex classes may have salutary effects for inner city minority boys. Engaging more male teachers as role models may sound laudatory, but there is no evidence that sex of teacher has an independent effect on boys' achievement. These reforms typically rest on shaky biological foundations that boys are girls are so fundamentally different that they need Mars and Venus classrooms -- with different class configurations, desk arrangements, teaching styles and even temperature settings (boys at 68 degrees Fahrenheit, girls at 72 degrees Fahrenheit). What social scientists actually know is that the small mean differences between boys and girls on any measurable trait pale in comparison with the enormous variations among boys and among girls. We have to ask why so few boys were selected. Some will argue that since students were nominated by their English teachers (who are usually female) the teachers simply didn't ""see"" boys' submissions as worthy of consideration in a national competition. I think the social scientific evidence leads in a different direction. Boys' underachievement is driven by masculinity -- that is, what boys think it means to be a man is often at odds with succeeding in school. Stated most simply, many boys regard academic disengagement as a sign of their masculinity. How little they care about school, about studying, about succeeding -- these are markers of manhood in peer groups of middle and high school boys around the country. In a brilliant ethnography, psychologist Wayne Martino observed middle school boys and girls. When he asked boys why they were doing poorly in English they said things like:""Reading is lame, sitting down and looking at words is pathetic,"" or ""Most guys who like English are faggots."" Another boy noted:I find English hard. It's because there are no set rules for reading texts. . . English isn't like math where you have rules on how to do things and where there are right and wrong answers. In English you have to write down how you feel and that's what I don't like.Compare this to the comment of one of the girls in the same class:I feel motivated to study English because... you have freedom in English -- unlike subjects such as math and science -- and your view isn't necessarily wrong. There is no definite right or wrong answer and you have the freedom to say what you feel is right without it being rejected as a wrong answer.It is not the school experience that ""feminizes"" boys, but rather the ideology of traditional masculinity that keeps boys from wanting to succeed. ""The work you do here is girls' work,"" one boy commented to a different researcher. ""It's not real work."" Or, as Catharine Stimpson, Dean of the Graduate School at NYU once put it, ""Real men don't speak French."" If we want to understand boy's underachievement in writing, literature, and languages -- if we want to understand why so few boys won this year's Promising Young Writers award -- we need look no further than the way boys perceive these subjects. We must make academic engagement a sign of manhood -- which we can only do by interrupting those other voices that tell our young boys to tune out."

I squeezed my eyes shut, taking a few more deep breaths as Kaitlyn, one of the event planners for the 2013 Relay for Life at UIUC and a new friend of mine, gave me a short introduction. As I heard the welcoming, echoing sound of applause, I knew it was time to verbally tell my story to the world for the first time, no longer hiding behind the bright lights of my laptop screen. I was a whole mix of emotions when Kaitlyn, on behalf of Colleges Against Cancer here at my university, extended the invitation to speak during the Relay for Life opening ceremonies at the beginning of April. Excited, honored, scared, anxious, grateful -- it all hit me at once, and I hadn't even figured out what I was going to say. Once I accepted, Kaitlyn sent me a list of guidelines to follow with my speech. I looked them over multiple times, unsure of how to tell my story the right way on my behalf, and on behalf of young adult cancer patients and survivors everywhere. It's such a tough topic, despite me being so intimate with the details of it. I wanted to do it justice.I reread the previous articles I've written for The Huffington Post, scraps and mini-pieces I had on my cancer blog as I went through treatment, and diary entries I kept at the time. Nothing came to me. Finally, on the day of Relay, April 20th, I walked to Chipotle in the beautiful spring weather (one of the few we've had in Illinois!) with my friend Liz, contemplating the writing I still hadn't done. And finally, as took in all of the smiles and stares my fuzzy little buzz-cut usually gets, I knew what I had to write. Just like the guidelines said, I spent a little bit on the actual background of my diagnosis and treatment, and my connection to CAC, Relay, and the American Cancer Society. But the rest of the article, the real meat of it, came from the heart. I spoke about being a college student and a cancer patient. It was, after all, the reason I'd been asked to speak over other survivors -- my story was recent, real, and relatable to a college-age audience. So, to my friends, family, and a large number of total strangers, I recalled the woes and lessons I encountered during my battle and continue to encounter today. I should have known from how well-received my blogging and writing has been -- I have something to say, as a young adult who's beaten cancer, and people do want to hear it.I'm still reeling from the state of pseudo-college-celebrity I enjoyed that night, and how amazing it was to have friends and strangers alike celebrate life and fight back against cancer at my side. It was my first Relay, and while I wish I'd been able to experience the amazingness that it is earlier in my life, my special connection to it made it as great a night as it truly was. And I learned a whole new lesson that night, even this far after chemo and remission. I have a reason to keep on fighting. Cancer is a fight that, while it's physically ended for me, I will continue to fight for the rest of my life as a survivor. I didn't choose to be an advocate, but I now understand that it's a gift, and I need to do more than sit at my computer and encourage others to act -- I need to act, too.I look forward to many, many more years of Relay -- to many more survivors joining me in the opening lap, to more of my family being able to attend, and to the event gaining more and more attention not just on my campus, but on campuses and in towns all over the country and the world.Lindsay's speech from the 2013 Relay for Life at the University of Illinois can be found here."
