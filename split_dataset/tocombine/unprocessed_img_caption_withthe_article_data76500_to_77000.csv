It is also the company's biggest creditor, holding $15 million of debt.Standard General could not be reached for comment.Charney has filed several lawsuits against the company, alleging defamation, representation in false light and securities fraud.These lawsuits are also likely to be delayed by the bankruptcy, Saunders said.American Apparel's secured lenders will provide about $90 million in debtor-in-possession financing, and have committed $70 million of new capital, the company said. The restructuring is expected to be completed in about six months.The bankruptcy did not come as a surprise.American Apparel, whose shares closed at 11.2 cents on Friday, said in August it might not have enough capital to sustain operations for 12 months. As of Friday, the company had a market value of $20.5 million.Teen apparel retailers are struggling as customers switch to fast-fashion brands such as H&M, Forever 21 and Inditex's Zara. Online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc are also undercutting bricks-and-mortar stores.Other teen-focused retailers filing for bankruptcy in the past year include Wet Seal, Cache Inc, Deb Shops, Delia*s and Body Central Corp.The American Apparel case is in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, Case No: 15-12055.

1,POLITICS,Advocates Urge Cuomo To End Shackling Of Pregnant Women,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cuomo-pregnant-women-shackling_us_5611d380e4b0af3706e12eff,"It's ""one of the most offensive human rights violations imaginable,""  one advocate said.",2015-10-05,Tina Tinen says she was shackled right before and immediately after she gave birth. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5612b69a1400005b00bfc1b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Advocates dressed up in fake pregnant bellies and wearing shackles rallied in front of the office of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) on Monday, pressing him to sign a bill that would strengthen a 2009 law that banned the shackling of incarcerated women during childbirth.""Shackling pregnant women is one of the most offensive human rights violations imaginable,"" said Tamar Kraft-Stolar, the director of the Women in Prison Project at the Correctional Association of New York. The childbirth experience should be ""filled with support and dignity,"" she said, not punishment. In 2009, New York passed a law that prohibited the use of shackles on pregnant women during labor, delivery and recovery. However, a disturbing report the Correctional Association of New York released in February found that women are still being shackled, in direct violation of the law. A survey taken after the legislation took effect found that 23 of 27 pregnant women who were interviewed said they were shackled at some point during their childbirth experience.The 2015 Anti-Shackling Bill, which passed the state Assembly and the state Senate in June, extends the ban on shackling to include the entire duration of the pregnancy and an eight-week postpartum period.It also requires correctional officials to tell incarcerated pregnant women about their rights under the law, and prohibits correctional staff from being inside the delivery room during the birth unless requested by the woman or medical professionals. A number of women who gave birth while incarcerated in New York spoke about their painful experiences. Tina Tinen, who served time at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women while pregnant with her son, said she slipped and fell while shackled a few weeks before she went in labor.When it was time to give birth, she said, she was shackled on her way to the hospital and immediately after the delivery. ""The first person who saw my baby was the officer in the room, who watched his head pop out,"" she said. ""It was disrespectful."" Leading women's health organizations oppose shackling women during labor because the practice can lead to significant health risks, including ""increased likelihood of falls, trauma and limited access for treatment during medical emergencies."""

3,POLITICS,Texas Professors Warn Allowing Guns In Class Will Inhibit Free Speech,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/guns-in-class-free-speech_us_5612a720e4b0af3706e16f13,"When students are having outbursts in class and vandalizing their professors' offices, bringing guns into school buildings seems unlikely to help.",2015-10-05,"Adm. William McRaven, the chancellor of the University of Texas System, addresses the Texas Board of Regents, Thursday, Aug. 21, 2014, in Austin, Texas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a women's and gender studies professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Lisa Moore is often the very first person to expose her students to the ideas that underpin LGBT literature and culture. Now, she's worried a new state gun law could change how she teaches.""I've had experiences over the years that have been frightening,"" Moore told The Huffington Post. ""Like having my office broken into, and posters pulled off the walls and burned. Having 'Depravity Kills' written 16 times on my window.""Once, a student who had a mental illness and who'd been disruptive in class needed to take a medical withdrawal from one of Moore's courses. The student remained on campus, however. ""I had to teach that class under an undisclosed location under armed guard for the rest of the semester,"" Moore said.In cases like these, if students had been allowed to bring guns into campus buildings, Moore thinks things could have unfolded even more alarmingly. ""I would have avoided my office and therefore not be available to my students or colleagues,"" Moore said. She doubts students, after witnessing an emotionally charged disruption in class, would return knowing one of their classmates might be armed.A new law signed by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) this year will force public colleges and universities in the state to allow guns into their campus buildings. But Moore is one of a number of educators who worry that allowing guns in the vicinity of classrooms and professors' offices could have a chilling effect on free speech, thus violating academic freedom. Many faculty members at UT Austin are rallying to push administrators to restrict guns from school classrooms and offices.There is a fear someone ""could shoot them for their viewpoint,"" said Pat Somers, a professor of education at the school. ""Disciplinary hearings may take on an entirely new dimension when those involved in the charges may be armed.""At an open forum on the issue last week, several professors worried they would be at risk with guns in the class while they discuss controversial subjects. ""I'm a lesbian. That does not necessarily make me liked by all of my students or others, and I'm afraid for myself,"" said Ann Cvetkovich, a professor of English at UT Austin, at the forum. ""I'm afraid for my students, but also very afraid for myself.""At one point, Cvetkovich alluded to a separate debate taking place on campuses nationwide, the question of whether instructors should offer trigger warnings when their lessons contain material that some students may find traumatizing. ""I hate to think of 'trigger warning' not becoming a metaphor, but becoming a reality,"" she said. ""That students who are triggered might actually pull a trigger.""State Sen. Brian Birdwell (R-Granbury), who sponsored the Senate version of the campus carry legislation that ultimately became law, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.As of Monday afternoon, more than 300 professors at the University of Texas had signed a petition to ""refuse"" guns in their classrooms. Several faculty members staged a protest last week against allowing guns in classes.Joan Neuberger, a history professor at UT Austin who helped organize the petition, told HuffPost that instructors' free speech concerns are at the ""heart of the opposition"" to guns in class.""Classrooms aren't like other free speech areas,"" Neuberger said. ""They're unique in the sense that you have young people, often in a situation for the first time, in debate with people who are very different.""Concealed carry has been allowed on campus grounds at Texas' public universities for about two decades, but the new bill extends that to the buildings themselves. Public Texas universities are now allowed to enact ""reasonable"" regulations about where someone can have a gun on campus, and where they must store them, but the new rules cannot ""have the effect of generally prohibiting"" license holders from carrying concealed handguns on campus. The university system is currently engaged in a working group to determine what limitations will be used on campus. Adm. William McRaven, chancellor of the University of Texas System, was opposed to the Texas guns on campus bill. McRaven, who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden before he retired from the U.S. Navy, suggested to The Texas Tribune in February that having guns in the class could infringe on free speech rights.""I have spent my life fighting for the Second Amendment,"" McRaven said then. ""You know, you have to ask yourself, 'Why did the Founding Fathers put freedom of speech as the First Amendment?' They may have done that because freedom of speech is incredibly important, and if you have guns on campus, I question whether or not that will somehow inhibit our freedom of speech.""The University of Texas System did not make McRaven available to HuffPost for further comment. UT Austin did not respond to a question about the faculty petition.Faculty members have raised a number of concerns about the forthcoming law, pointing out that it will not necessarily prevent a mass killing of the kind seen at Virginia Tech in 2007 or Umpqua Community College last week. Opponents are encouraging people to refer to the legislation as ""Abbott's Law,"" to make the governor take ownership of the bill he signed. But when professors voice their reservations, the discussion often goes back to academic freedom. ""I can write a syllabus that says what's allowed in the classroom,"" said Max Snodderly, a neuroscience professor at UT Austin, at last week's forum. ""Normally it includes cell phones. I think it should also include horses and guns.""Andrew Jackson, an undergraduate at UT Austin, disagreed with the anti-gun views expressed at the forum. To say that concealed carry would inhibit First Amendment rights, he argued, is tantamount to saying you don't have faith in students' ability to ""have adult conversations"" about difficult issues.Nearly two dozen bills have been presented in 2015 to force guns onto college campuses, according to the Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus, an activist group. Only the Texas bill has been signed into law thus far. The law will take effect on Aug. 1, 2016, 50 years to the day after the first mass school shooting, which took place at UT Austin.______Tyler Kingkade is a senior editor and reporter covering higher education, and is based in New York.

Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) announced his candidacy for speaker of the House of Representatives on Sunday, setting off a contentious race with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for the powerful post.""Today, here, I am announcing my intention to run for speaker of the House of Representatives,"" Chaffetz said in an interview with Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We were entrusted by the American people with the largest majority Republicans have had since Babe Ruth was swinging the baseball bat, but they didn’t send us here to perpetuate the status quo.""Chaffetz, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said that McCarthy lacks the support of conservative Republican congressmen needed to win the leadership position in a vote on the House floor. Chaffetz, by contrast, believes he can win the votes of conservative members and unite the party.""There are 246 Republicans that will vote, but there are nearly 50 people -- a growing number -- that will not and cannot vote for Kevin McCarthy as the speaker on the floor,"" Chaffetz said. ""I think those 50-plus people find that I am a fair and even-balanced person, that I can bridge that divide between our more centrist members and some of the more far right-wing members.""Chaffetz said that he had joined the race at the behest of other House members. He plans to bring conservative bills to the House floor for a vote even if they are unlikely to pass. ""I wanna vote more, not less,"" Chaffetz said. ""I don’t want these things to be pre-baked. I want the committees to be more empowered.""Chaffetz also hinted that he would be more willing to use the brinkmanship tactics favored by the most conservative Republicans. But he stopped short of saying he was willing to provoke a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding.""We’re gonna have that discussion internally,"" he said. ""My job is to help put a bill on the president’s desk."" Chaffetz has led the fight to defund Planned Parenthood in the House.Chaffetz did not rule out a fight over raising the debt ceiling, which will need to occur by Nov. 5 to avoid default, but did not commit to any concrete conditions for its increase either.""I don’t wanna borrow more money from China,"" he said.McCarthy was the widespread favorite for the top leadership position until a gaffe last week elicited criticism from his fellow Republicans. McCarthy praised the Benghazi committee on Tuesday for hurting Hillary Clinton politically, exposing the GOP to accusations that it was using the committee as a partisan witch hunt.Chaffetz tacitly referenced the remarks in a Sunday letter asking Republican colleagues for their support. ""We need a Speaker who is an effective communicator,"" he wrote.But Chaffetz's bid reflects long-simmering skepticism of McCarthy among conservative House members, who believe he will continue outgoing Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) approach, which they argue is too accommodating to the president.""The American public wants to see a change,"" he said. ""They want a fresh start. There is a reason why we see this phenomenon across the country. You don’t just give an automatic promotion to the existing leadership. That doesn’t signal change.""Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting."
6,POLITICS,Maybe Rand Paul Took That 'Snapchat Election' Thing Too Seriously,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rand-paul-campaign-snapchat_us_560ee41fe4b0768127020888,He gave the voters a good look at him -- and now it looks like he's gone.,2015-10-04,"Whatever happened to Rand Paul, the next president?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5862e13d1500002300916101.jpeg?cache=PteKMK28Yj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Last October, for the third time in three years, Sen. Rand Paul made the cover of Time magazine. The headline: ""The Most Interesting Man in American Politics.""The New York Times Magazine had just put him on the cover that August, with a lot of edgy graphics proclaiming him a ""Major Threat"" to the Republican establishment.It made sense, or it seemed to. In the very, very early polls, the Kentucky senator was running neck-and-neck with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for the top spot in the GOP's 2016 presidential nomination race. And why not? Rand (everyone calls him by his first name) was nervy, different, rebellious, smart, unpredictable, entertainingly nasty and, at times, riveting.Well, what a difference a year makes.If this is the Snapchat election (and a number of candidates are using the app just in case), then Rand Paul is the Snap candidate: He was everywhere for an instant, then all but disappeared. With his poll numbers failing, can he persuade voters to look again? Is it even wise for him to stay in the race, given that he still has the option of running for re-election to the Senate next year and perhaps should concentrate on that?His aides and advisers insist that he will stay the presidential course and that he has a plan: to guard his small hoard of cash, fly below the radar until emerging with caucus victories in less-watched states such as Nevada, Minnesota and Kansas, and in his own home state, where he strong-armed GOP officials into holding a special caucus for him.Perhaps. But the reasons for the decline of the Paul campaign over the last year are adding up. They include the advent of more outrageous, unpredictable outsiders like real estate mogul Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson; the rise of the Islamic State, which made Paul's relative lack of militance feel out of place; and Paul's own departures from libertarian orthodoxy on spending and Senate procedure. His prickly, impatient persona, which made him so fascinating to reporters, hasn't played well on the campaign trail either.This past week, his campaign's slow leak threatened to turn into a full blowout.Nationally, Paul's poll numbers have sunk so low that he is in danger of not making the cut for the CNBC presidential debate on Oct. 28. The minimum is 3 percent, which Paul makes only if the network adheres to its promise to ""round up"" the numbers for those with at least 2.5 percent. (Paul is currently at 2.3 percent or 2.8, depending on which poll aggregator you use.) And of course he can't afford to lose ground in any other new poll. The money situation is just as dicey. A super PAC that had been backing Paul bailed on him last week, and his own campaign reported that he had collected only $2.5 million in the third quarter of this year -- about two-thirds less than the previous quarter and about one-tenth of what Carson took in.Around the country, Paul has some well-liked supporters and staffers -- among them Doug Stafford, his national strategist, and Mike Biundo, his guy in New Hampshire and the rest of New England. New Hampshire, with its ""Live Free or Die"" motto, should be ideal territory for Paul. ""He is really sharp and there are a lot of libertarians here,"" said Joe McQuaid, who heads the company that runs the state's largest newspaper, The Union-Leader.On the other hand, McQuaid noted, Trump drew an astonishing crowd of 3,500 to an event in the western part of the state the other day, ""and there wasn't even a pumpkin festival there.""Fran Wendelboe, a grassroots GOP organizer in the state who is unaffiliated with any candidate, was less positive about Paul.""He's running on fumes up here,"" she said. ""Trump is just blowing everything else out, and yes, he has a ground organization. A lot of would-be Rand people are with Trump. And if they aren't with Trump, they seem to be going in the direction of [Texas Sen.] Ted Cruz.""With the situation murky on the presidential campaign trail, Paul and his aides need to worry about their Old Kentucky Home. The current GOP nominee for governor, businessman Matt Bevin (who has feuded with Paul in the past), recently said that, while he wasn't endorsing anyone, his personal favorite for the GOP presidential nomination was … Carson.The Kentucky GOP did support Paul's desire to hold a separate presidential caucus on March 5, 2016 -- so that he could also run in the May 17 Senate primary -- but there remains the matter of who will pay for what. Paul kicked in $250,000 from his campaign coffers for the special caucus and has agreed to pay more, if necessary. But the state GOP could still be on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in no mood to Stand for Rand.In the general election for his Senate seat in 2016, Paul is likely to face a strong Democratic opponent, probably State Auditor Adam Edelen, a personable, eloquent young pol with rural roots, ties to the University of Kentucky, and good support in metropolitan Louisville.That might mean that the safer course for Paul would be to drop out of the presidential race and focus on the Senate. His ally of convenience, senior Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, would prefer it. As Senate leader, McConnell has a GOP majority to protect.But having insisted on a separate presidential caucus next March, Paul can hardly stand down now, or anytime soon. He has to stay in the race until at least early spring.""Rand is stuck,"" said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), who didn't sound unhappy about that prospect.So how does Paul make the best of a tough situation? By husbanding his cash (which can be used in the Senate race, if necessary), by focusing on out-of-the-way caucus states, and by hoping that other weak candidates fall by the wayside while Hurricanes Donald and Ben blow over. Stafford, his national strategist, insists that his man has staying power and real appeal. If that's so, Paul has to show it ASAP, certainly at the CNBC debate, assuming that he has the poll numbers to get there. Otherwise, he could be one Snap away from vanishing altogether."

""It doesn't seem to work.""He acknowledged that the U.S. has a higher rate of school shootings than other countries. But he faulted mental illness and ""copycat"" behavior that leads troubled individuals to imitate mass shooters, not the availability of guns.""Guns, no guns, it doesn't matter,"" he said. ""You have people that are mentally ill. And they're gonna come through the cracks.""In fact, people with mental illnesses are no more likely to commit acts of violence than anybody else. They commit just 3 to 5 percent of all violent incidents, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump's comments echo those of conservatives who have claimed that Umpqua Community College was a gun-free zone. In fact, the college's ban on firearms and other weapons has a significant exception: In accordance with Oregon state law, students with licenses to carry a concealed gun may do so on campus.Also on HuffPost:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560afe431900003000fdeb61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Nadia Bolz-Weber is the kind of pastor who ends up doing funerals for an alcoholic stand-up comic and a transvestite. The founder of Denver’s House for All Sinners and Saints, this tattooed, profanity-loving Lutheran pastor wants nothing more than to tell it like it is.Her newest book, “Accidental Saints: Finding God in All the Wrong People,” expands on her trademark exploration of finding God in the unexpected.“When it comes down to it,” said Bolz-Weber, “the church is for losers. We connect to each other and to God through our shared brokenness, not through our personal victories and strengths and accomplishments. This is why it’s hilarious to me when people sort of write me off as hipster Christianity. You have definitely not been to my congregation. It is not hip.”Bolz-Weber talked recently with Religion News Service about the book. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.Q: In the book, one of your critiques of social justice goes like this: “Nobody gets to play Jesus.”A: People say, “I’m just a Jesus-follower. I want to be just like Jesus.” No one’s like Jesus, man. Jesus was Jesus. Jesus was God. You’re not God. You’re going to fail.If we’re trying to be forgiving people because that’s the way Jesus was, and yet we’re never willing to confess our sins and admit what we need forgiveness for, good luck with being a forgiving person.Q: Everywhere you see people trying to better themselves, yet you write that, “We always love imperfectly. It is the nature of human love. And it is okay.”A: In conservative Christianity, there’s this question, “How is your relationship with the Lord? Do you have a right relationship with God?” I’m more and more convinced that right relationship with God is just standing naked in front of our Creator and receiving the love as broken people. Right relationship is confession and forgiveness. That’s right relationship. Allowing God to be the forgiving, redeeming God that God wants to be for us. Whereas we think that being in right relationship is not making any mistakes so we don’t have to bother the guy. That’s not a relationship, then.Q: You wrote about a guy named Billy who struggled with heroin and booze, “sometimes played piano in his sister’s dresses” and eventually took his own life. You say he was “pretty much exactly the kind of person Jesus would hang out with.” What do you mean?A: I’ve just become more and more confused about how Christianity became what it is today, given how it started. It just keeps puzzling me. It didn’t start with the religious authorities. It didn’t start with the people for whom life was easy. It didn’t start with people who were nailing whatever purity system was being handed to them at the time. It started with rank fishermen and prostitutes and tax collectors — people for whom life wasn’t easy. And yet that’s whom Jesus chose to surround himself with.Q: Why do you write that we’re punished by our sins and not for our sins?Hell, yeah, man. Harboring resentment instead of forgiving someone — that’s like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies. That’s its own punishment, just like shopping at Wal-Mart is its own punishment. Being punished for your sins implies that God’s going to wreak havoc on you, God has this score sheet, and if you go over a certain number, then God’s going to make some horrible thing happen to you. God doesn’t have to do that. We do it to ourselves. Good Lord! We create our own hell.Q: Do you think God punishes?A: All I can say is, I certainly hope not. Because I’d be screwed. All I can say is, I think if God punishes, then I don’t understand Jesus on the cross saying, “Forgive them, for they know not what they’re doing.” If God was that sort of punishing God, then I can’t think of a better situation than striking down all the people who crucified Jesus. I mean, that’s what I’d do. That’s why I need a God who’s not like me to save me.Q: What do you mean by God’s saying “yes” to humanity, instead of “maybe”?A: I’ve been taught that God says, “Well, we’ll see how good you are.” That’s the maybe.I think there’s a way in which there’s this sort of yes from God that we reject all the time. We’d rather have the ball in our own court. So God says: “The game’s over. You don’t have to compete anymore.” I’m like, “Yeah, but I feel like if I compete, then I’m in control.” Grace actually feels like I’m totally powerless. I have no power. I have no agency. And that feels terrible to us, and we reject it over and over and instead go: “You know, I’m working on my own redemption project over here. I’m going to see how that pans out.”Q: At the end of “Accidental Saints,” you rewrite Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount with alternate “saints” — for example, “Blessed are the agnostics.” How is doubt saintly?A: Doubt’s not the opposite of faith to me at all. I think certainty’s the opposite of faith. Doubt means you’re in an active, dynamic relationship to an idea. Certainty means you’re done thinking about it. I think there’s something really sacred about doubt. It’s part and parcel of faith to me. That’s why I go on to say something like, “Blessed are they who aren’t so sure they’ve figured it out that they stop taking in new information.” Q: Also making the list are hospital orderlies, NFL players and their fundraising trophy-wives. There’s something very physical about all these examples, and you say God is “blessing all human flesh.” What does God care about flesh? Isn’t God concerned with the soul?A: I think a physical life is a spiritual life. God chose to have of all things a human body. God didn’t spare God the indignity of having things like the hiccups. God chose to have a body. What does that mean about all human bodies?Q: You’ve got a whole chapter about King Herod’s slaughtering of the innocents and the Sandy Hook shooting. Why do you think it’s important to remember Herod in the Christmas story?A: When we’re talking about Christmas, one of the important things we have to look at is, what kind of world did God choose to enter? What was going on in the world at this point? And how did God choose to enter it?God chose to enter a world as violent and faithless as our own. I feel like that’s an important thing to know about God.How do we reflect theologically about what’s going on now? Political tyranny, or in the case of Christmastime 2012, when a bunch of kids are slaughtered in their schoolroom. This is what Christmas is about. I don’t want to put Herod on wrapping paper, necessarily. But Herod has to be part of the Christmas story. He just has to be. I can’t stand that blend of sentimentality and religion that we’re seeing in cultural Christianity. I don’t think it’s in any way helping us make sense of the world as it actually exists.
