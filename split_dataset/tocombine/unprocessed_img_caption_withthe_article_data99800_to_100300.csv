So, from that perspective, President Obama's ""America's College Promise"" proposal for ""free"" community college is a great idea! A similar program in Tennessee, the site of President Obama's announcement, is apparently hugely successful.What could possibly go wrong with such a simple concept?Plenty. Every gift horse has the potential of a few bad teeth, so we should not expect perfection in this or any governmental proposal. I'm less worried about a few bad teeth and more worried that the proposal is really a Trojan Horse that appears to offer needy students relief from tuition bills but that, in fact, comes loaded with hidden costs like more regulations and potential reduction in benefits for students who choose other kinds of institutions instead of community colleges.America's College Promise could be great for many students if it does these things:1. Encourage new enrollments: If the program really does encourage more people who otherwise would not go to college to get going on the pathway to higher learning, then great! All evidence points to the simple fact that more education improves earning potential across the lifespan. At the same time, if more workers get more advanced skills in the job training programs of community colleges, or get onto the pathway for more advanced learning in baccalaureate and graduate programs, then the national economy will reap the considerable benefits of a more educated workforce.2. Reduce student debt: Depending on its structure, the plan has the potential to reduce student loan debt burdens by eliminating the need to take out loans for the first two years of college, thus reducing the overall cost of baccalaureate degrees for those students who choose to keep earning advanced credentials beyond job training certificates and associate degrees. 3. Solve Pell limitations: In the same way, the plan could contribute an important solution to the problem that low income students face due to arbitrary limits on Pell Grant eligibility -- Pell Grants currently do not support summer courses, and Pell eligibility tops out at 12 semesters, a myopic regulatory quirk that thwarts students who need longer periods of enrollment to complete major programs such as nursing and other credit-heavy degrees.4. Reverse state disinvestment:  During the last decade states have notoriously reduced their investments in higher education. By leveraging federal dollars as the lion's share of the tuition price for community colleges, this proposal could offer states the opportunity to re-invest dollars saved into their universities. However, the gift horse becomes a Trojan Horse if the appearance of government largesse turns out to be a false front hiding reductions in federal support for students attending other kinds of institutions, or imposing new and more costly federal regulations. What are the dangers lurking inside of this popular idea?1. Displacing existing enrollments: Rather than achieving the goal of educating more Americans, particularly those on the margins, the proposal could simply cannibalize existing enrollments in higher education, particularly attracting more middle-class and even wealthier students to choose community colleges to get the ""free"" benefits while doing little to increase the enrollment of students who might not otherwise go to college. Why would this happen? The proposal is a solution that begs a more thorough understanding of the problem it's trying to solve. For many low income students, the barriers to enrolling in college are not just about money -- yes, money is a big barrier, but not the only one -- but also family and work responsibilities, poor academic preparation and basic concerns like housing, food and transportation. 2. False advertising: Education is not ""free."" Education costs money well beyond tuition price. Unless this program is prepared to cover all costs of attendance, advertising this proposal as ""free"" education is a set-up for students who may not understand that they will still incur significant expenses to attend even community college. 3. Thwarting Pell Grant Improvements:  If the proposal winds up displacing federal funds from other financial aid programs -- and particularly if it thwarts the need to keep improving Pell Grant benefits -- then it will harm millions of students enrolled in baccalaureate colleges and masters or research universities in the guise of offering ""free"" education to those in community colleges. Rather than offering a creative and more just solution to get everyone more educated, a plan that reduces other forms of federal financial aid will undermine the ultimate goals and betray the students who rely on federal aid across all types of institutions and all degree levels.4. Increasing federal reach and regulation: Community colleges are traditionally part of state systems, and the funding and oversight of public higher education is a state responsibility. A federal takeover of state community colleges is a dramatic step toward federalizing higher education more completely at all levels, and invites an expanded level of regulation that would make the current regulatory nightmare look simple.America's College Promise, while seeming like an extraordinary innovation on the surface, takes a very traditional view of higher education's structure at a time when higher education is changing somewhat dramatically on many campuses. Many public and private universities today educate exactly the same population that enrolls in community colleges, so the underlying assumption that students in one sector need and deserve support while others do not is simply wrong. Federal financial aid has never discriminated against students based on the kind of institution they attend. America's College Promise would change the structure of federal financial aid by favoring students enrolling in one sector while ignoring the reality of millions of low income students enrolled not only in public but also in private institutions. Moreover, because of this problem with favoring the community college sector, the Obama proposal could have the unintended consequence of tracking low income students away from baccalaureate education, a perverse potential result that seems to work against the Administration's aggressive efforts in other venues to encourage more low income students to enroll in more elite institutions. For many students, the educational advantages of starting in baccalaureate education directly are considerable, and the lure of saving money by starting at the associate degree level could reduce, not increase, the ultimate educational outcomes for the nation.Education is not free. A higher education has a value that should not be obscured by the sheer populism of this kind of proposal. While many students certainly need support to advance in education beyond high school, the Administration must be careful not to send a message of devaluing higher learning by labeling something as ""free"" that should require consumer investment along with public support. The Administration must also be careful to avoid the appearance of dumbing-down all of higher education by suggesting that students really only need the first two years, that the rest is not so important.If the dangers inherent in this proposal can be addressed, then it certainly has the potential to be the kind of game-changer that many supporters are claiming it will be. Community colleges do great work and certainly deserve an honored place in higher education, and this proposal would solidify their clear value for many students. But student options and choices about where to start on the pathway to post-secondary degrees should be based on learning opportunities and not simply the message of ""free."""

Masked gunmen stormed the Paris offices of a weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo that caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, killing at least 12 people, including the editor, before escaping in a car. It was France's deadliest postwar terrorist attack. (AP Photo/Bob Edme)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c3691f00002501247f6a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As I write this, it is just few days after the barbaric attacks on French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and already the inevitable backlash against the murdered victims has begun. Firstly, it comes from those who seek to question the judgment of the victims. Then it comes from publications and social media activists who seek to delegitimize Charlie Hebdo without understanding either the context of the newspaper's content or its place within French society and history. Meanwhile they are all, intentionally or not, managing to take our attention off the reality of this brutal crime and focus it somewhere else, oftentimes on their own ideological agenda. It is disappointing and immensely depressing that the conversation is beginning to be hijacked in this way. The first group is the most cowardly. Figures who should know better, such as Tony Barber of the Financial Times and even the U.S. government when the newspaper was attacked in 2011, maintain that because Charlie Hebdo was baiting terrorists by continuing to print cartoons deemed offensive by some Muslims and they should have stopped publishing such cartoons or should have understood the risks and never published any at all. To these people I ask, how can we defend our most cherished beliefs if we roll over as soon as they are challenged? Of course the staff of Charlie Hebdo knew the risks. They were firebombed in 2011 and continued publishing. Executive editor Stephane Charbonnier had even said in a by now much referenced quote originally attributed to Emiliano Zapata, ""I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees."" These gutless assertions by Barber and others, that the newspaper should have stood down when intimidated, would be laughable if they weren't so despicable coming as they did so soon after the event. The second group is newer and in some ways more troubling including, as it does, sources I often respect. It is born out of a growing obsession with identity politics in the left-wing press and social media often for legitimate reasons such as the Ferguson and Staten Island police brutality cases. To greater or lesser degrees in publications like Slate, Canadaland, and on sites like Tumblr, the focus is no longer on the terrible tragedy, the victims, nor on what this all means for the future of free expression but instead on Charlie Hebdo's supposed racism and Islamophobia in its depictions of Muhammad, and inexplicably by extension, all Muslims. A new hashtag has appeared, #JeNeSuisPasCharlie, in reaction to #JeSuisCharlie which began to show up just after the attack. The proponents of this counter-narrative argue that because the Charlie Hebdo cartoons were 'racist,' this somehow made the crime less grave or consequential and that we shouldn't hold the newspaper up as a bastion of free speech. Some go so far as to consider its depictions hate speech and in league with fascist right-wing parties like Marine Le Pen's Front National.Of course these commentators don't understand, don't care about, or don't bother to learn the context in which these cartoons first appeared. They conveniently ignore the magazine's left-wing credentials and commitment to anti-racism and anti-homophobia. They ignore how the newspaper goes after many right-wing targets (including Front National) as well as the left and all religions indiscriminately including similarly offensive images of Jews and Catholics, the predominant religion of France and of the right-wing of the country. They ignore the anger they caused to many in the political center, right and far right and the incredible irony now occurring of opportunistic right-wing fanatics coming to their defense.Charlie Hebdo was an equal opportunity offender and has angered many in France of all levels of society. The newspaper is also part of a proud history of French satire which dates back to before the 1789 revolution. It was a tradition that found a resurgence in the form of cartoons during the 1960s and 1970s following the student revolution in 1968. This troubling new distraction in the conversation is as problematic as those of the conspiracy theorists who inevitably argue the murders were a false flag attack committed by the CIA. Even with the lame and spineless ""of course they shouldn't have been killed"" qualifier before it, these race-oriented critiques often come alarmingly close to equivocation or, as with the #JeNeSuisPasCharlie hashtag, victim blaming (something that many social media activists are right to decry in other contexts). This is not to say that all critiques of Charlie Hebdo are illegitimate all of the time. Many reasonable and intelligent people have expressed their dismay at what they have published in the past and they may be right. The point is that now is not the time.We need publications like Charlie Hebdo now more than ever because of exactly what their crude, offensive, and difficult work represents. It is a challenge to authority, and a challenge to those who would wish to use violence as an act of oppression. We must recognize the value that comes from pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable, of breaking taboos, of standing up to thugs. Not to do so speaks to a form of cowardice only supplanted by the news outlets who have refused to show the cartoons and the even more pathetic attempts to justify that decision. It gives those who wish to intimidate us exactly what they want: self-censorship brought on by fear. If we cannot even agree that these values of free expression so important to democracy need to be defended no matter of what form they take then we truly are lost. It is through protecting that which some may see as profane that is the real test of liberal democracies. If we cannot do that then we have lost the war against the illiberal forces that threaten us."

More than 200 people gathered to decry the terrorism in which 17 people and three al-Qaida-inspired gunmen were killed over three days of bloodshed at the offices of the newspaper, a kosher supermarket and other sites around Paris. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e3b42100002501c96972.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula announced on Friday evening that it was responsible for the three-day rampage in France that started with the killing of 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine. It's been nearly a decade and a half since al Qaeda announced itself. Despite the shock and outrage after the 9/11 attacks, it went on to stage several more attacks, fight two wars, and develop global affiliates. Most recently, it has spawned a rival -- Islamic State (IS) -- which takes al Qaeda's ideas and applies them even more brutally. Clearly, the response isn't working. The anger at Wednesday's attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine and defiance towards those that perpetrated them are again leading to reactions that do little to actually thwart al Qaeda and instead actually help it to gain recruits. Since IS stole the Jihadi limelight after its summer blitzkrieg campaign in Iraq and Syria, it is not a huge surprise that al Qaeda is looking to re-install itself as the premier global Jihadist group. The Paris attack is classic al Qaeda -- a swift and violent assault on targets of high symbolic value. True to al Qaeda's way of integrated political, military and media war, the attack wasn't designed to be just a one-off act of vengeance. It was a calculated action designed to provoke a response that proves the veracity of its worldview. Where IS employs brutal force, al Qaeda prefers judo -- using its opponents own strength and direction of travel against them. So, what is the worldview al Qaeda is going to great lengths to convince its audience of? The U.S. Open Source Center's report on al Qaeda messaging breaks down the core elements of its vision as the following:• There is a war raging against Islam• Muslim rulers are puppets of the West • Muslim lands are being occupied • Violent Jihad is the only way to win back dignity • Willingness to die a martyr is the key to victory• Victory is the restoration of the caliphate As observers like Lawrence Wright, have noted, before 9/11, al Qaeda's saw the vast majority of Muslims were not interested in armed struggle to impose a literalist reading of Islamic law.The big, signature attacks were designed to create conditions whereby ordinary Muslim populations are marginalized and vilified enough to make them accept al Qaeda's view of the world and adopt its solution of a violent fight back. The idea that the struggle against violent extremism is a ""battle of narratives"" has become something of a cliché. And, the problem with clichés is that they lose real meaning. The battle of narratives with al Qaeda's ideology comes down to this simple idea: If Muslims and non-Muslims can live peacefully together in a just society, the premise of the group's ideology is demonstrably wrong. Equally, if countries in the Arab and wider Muslim worlds can evolve governments capable of serving their people and treating them fairly, then al Qaeda's proposed remedy becomes obsolete.As a journalist who covered extremism across the world since the 9/11 attacks, and then worked with governments to counter it, I fear the reaction to al Qaeda attacks more than the attacks themselves. The attacks are aimed at making young impressionable Muslims believe that al Qaeada's words are true. In reality, the attacks themselves don't accomplish that, but the reactions do. The images of occupation, arbitrary arrests, racial profiling, reports of torture, vigilante attacks etc. demonstrate the veracity of al Qaeda's claims much better than the group could ever do itself. It's worth exploring how the reactions to the attacks look to al Qaeda's target audience of young, disaffected and socially marginalized young people (predominantly but not exclusively Muslims). While the perpetrators were still on the run, reports surfaced of at least two mosques and a kebab shop in France being attacked with guns and grenades. Social media is awash with anti-Muslim bigotry. Such developments are hard to ignore, particularly as it creates the impression of popular, violent anti-Muslim sentiment amongst the mainstream. Western news outlets and ordinary social media users have taken to printing and sharing the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. In the majority of cases, this has been to show solidarity with the victims and to support the principle of free speech. The effect has been to stir debate amongst Muslim audiences about how free speech is lauded when it mocks Muslims but doesn't apply when it mocks or insults other groups. The discussion -- stemming from the reaction -- sharpens the already existing perception that Muslims face double standards in the West. Again, this plays perfectly into al Qaeda's central argument. The benefit of having Muslim leaders denounce acts like the Charlie Hebdo attack is limited to community relations rather than counter extremism. To the target audience they make figures of authority look like stooges. The biggest score for al Qaeda, however, has been the long-term response. Al Qaeda's initial claim that Western societies were dens of oppression with nothing to teach the Muslim world rang hollow to millions of people who might have disliked foreign policies but thought life in Europe and North America offered rights and equality under the law. The use of torture by U.S. agencies has gotten much coverage. However, Muslim audiences focus equally closely on issues such as profiling, unwarranted surveillance, secret trials and citizenship revocation. The message is that Western freedoms were never real and so the entire political construct is false. This, of course, then sets up al Qaeda to present its thoroughly flawed political vision as a viable alternative. Al Qaeda has gone from a few hundred men holed up in Afghanistan to a global affiliate network with a worldview that is becoming increasingly plausible. The only way to counter its strategy is through integrated security, political and communications action that demonstrates the veracity of a better vision -- in other words, in the same way as al Qaeda."

The move is considered a decisive step on Romero’s path to sainthood.Romero, the archbishop of San Salvador, was shot dead by right-wing death squads while celebrating Mass in March 1980. His murder came a day after he delivered a homily calling for soldiers to lay down their guns and end government repression in the country’s bloody civil war.Romero’s cause was started nearly two decades ago when St. John Paul II gave him the title of Servant of God in 1997. But his case never advanced amid lingering Vatican suspicion of Liberation Theology, an economically progressive approach to Catholicism that flourished under Romero and was suppressed by both John Paul and Benedict XVI.Pope Francis, the first pontiff elected from Latin America, reopened Romero’s cause soon after his 2013 election, and is said to be supportive of Romero’s sainthood. Last year, the current archbishop of El Salvador, Jose Luis Escobar Alas, and three other bishops met with the pope and said all Salvadoran bishops support Romero’s canonization.Sainthood is typically a two-step process where one miracle is required for beatification and a second miracle is required for canonization.Martyrs, however, can be beatified without a miracle; a second miracle attributed to Romero’s intercession would still be needed to make him a saint."

Newton's primary target was covered and when he came back to try and find Ed Dickson, Chancellor jumped the throw and returned his third career postseason interception for a touchdown.For all the tackles Chancellor made — and his hurdling exhibition — it was the hulking safety running alone for the first TD of his career that left CenturyLink Field shaking.""We have a full trust and understanding of his athletic ability.

The best running team in the NFL this season was held to 100 yards rushing by the Panthers defense.Marshawn Lynch was mostly a non-factor aside from a 25-yard run in the third quarter that helped set up Steven Hauschka's 37-yard field goal on the first play of the fourth quarter.But Wilson was outstanding, especially on third down. All three of his touchdown throws came on third-and-long situations. Baldwin beat safety Tre Boston on a double move on third-and-9 on his TD catch in the first quarter.Kearse's TD reception came on a third-and-7. And Willson's catch-and-run TD was on third-and-10.Wilson finished with a passer rating of 149.2, the second-highest for any game in his career. He was 8 of 8 for 199 yards passing on third downs.""That's just a fantastic night of coming through in critical situations,"" Carroll said.Newton played well, but turnovers were the Panthers' undoing. Newton finished 23 of 36 for 246 yards and added 37 yards rushing.

Michael Bennett disrupted the handoff between Newton and Stewart and Tony McDaniel fell on the loose ball at the Carolina 28.

None of the 162 people on the aircraft survived.Searchers have also been hearing pings, believed to be from the aircraft's two black boxes near where the tail of the Airbus A320-200 aircraft tail was raised on Saturday.Supriyadi, operations coordinator for the National Search and Rescue Agency, said on Sunday a sonar scan had revealed an object measuring 10 meters by four meters by 2.5 meters on the sea floor.""They suspect it is the body of the plane,"" Supriyadi told Reuters in the town of Pangkalan Bun, the base for the search effort on Borneo.""If it is the body of the plane then we will first evacuate the victims.""Forty-eight bodies have been found in the Java Sea off Borneo and searchers believe more will be found in the plane's fuselage.Strong winds, currents and high waves have been hampering efforts to reach other large pieces of suspected wreckage detected by sonar on the sea floor.BLACK BOX LOCATEDThree vessels involved in the search have detected pings about four km (two miles) from where the plane's tail was raised on Saturday, in water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.""The black boxes are in a crushed part of the aircraft debris, making it very difficult for the team of divers,"" said Tonny Budiono, a navigation director for the transport ministry.""Because of time constraints, (we) have decided to retrieve the black boxes tomorrow morning by gradually shifting these layers of aircraft body debris.""But if that fails, Budiono said divers would lift the debris using inflatable balloons, the same technique used to lift the tail section on Saturday.Navy spokesman Manahan Simorangkir, however, denied that the black box had been found, saying divers could not confirm its exact location due to poor weather and visibility.If and when the recorders are retrieved and taken to the capital, Jakarta, for analysis, it could take up to two weeks to download data, investigators said, although the information could be accessed in as little as two days if the devices are not badly damaged.While the cause of the crash is not known, the national weather bureau has said seasonal storms were likely to be a factor.President Joko Widodo said the crash exposed widespread problems in the management of air transportation in Indonesia.Separately on Sunday, a DHC-6 Twin Otter operated by Indonesia's Trigana Air crashed on landing at Enarotali Airport in Paniai, Papua, on Sunday.Strong winds caused the aircraft to roll over, domestic news website Detik.com reported, with no injuries to the three crew members on board. The plane was not carrying any passengers.

The church says its free speech rights, protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, were violated.The conservative-leaning court's last decision on a religious-themed issue came last June. The justices ruled 5-4 that owners of private companies can object on religious grounds to a provision of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law that requires employers to provide insurance covering birth control for women.The Arizona case is not as contentious, with the town receiving little support and the Obama administration backing the church.The church's leader, Pastor Clyde Reed, says the town's 2008 sign ordinance treated religious messages differently than other types of signs. The ordinance has different categories, based on content, that determine the size of the sign, where it can be placed, and how long it can be displayed.The church's signs were deemed to be event signs, which meant they received ""far worse treatment"" than other types, including those displaying political and ideological messages, its lawyers said.The town's lawyers asked the court not to hear the case, in part because a new, less restrictive ordinance was enacted in 2011.The church is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian group.Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, the Obama administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, said in court papers that the ordnance was clearly unconstitutional because it favors one type of speech over another.The only supporters for the town are local government groups such as the National League of Cities that say in court papers the Gilbert ordnance was legal in part because the restriction imposed on the church was the same one that other churches and civic groups advertising public events were bound by.The Supreme Court will review a February 2013 ruling in which the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the church's challenge.A ruling is expected by the end of June.The case is Reed v.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2bcfb2100003300c658d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Repeats story with no change to text)By Emily Flitter and Luciana LopezNEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - On the sidewalk of a public housing development in Brooklyn, New York notorious for gang violence and drug activity, the words ""Fascist pig, go home!"" in black spray paint are fading but still legible.These are the Marcy Houses, 27 brick H-block buildings, each six stories high, that are home to nearly 4,300 people, many of whom are black or Latino. The rapper Jay-Z, who grew up in the complex, described Marcy as ""a block away from hell,"" the place where ""news cameras never come,"" in a song called ""Where I'm From.""In recent years, Marcy has had a group of very reliable visitors: the police, who patrol on foot and in cars as part of a controversial ""broken windows"" strategy that focuses on cracking down on small crimes to prevent bigger ones. Until three weeks ago, they had been an ever-present, highly visible presence in Marcy Houses.Now, the police have all but disappeared, raising safety concerns among some residents while pleasing others who view the police strategy as oppressive. A reporter saw only one police car on a visit on Thursday.The shooting of two police officers in their patrol car a block away from the development on Dec. 20 has widened a rift between the police unions and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who they accuse of making anti-police statements and fueling a hostile environment for police, allegations he denies.Police department data shows the number of arrests and court summonses has plunged across the city since the shooting. But it is in higher crime areas like Marcy Houses, and neighborhoods such as Mott Haven in the Bronx, that the lower police profile may be of most concern.No court summonses were issued in the 79th police precinct, which includes Marcy Houses, in the week following the murder of the two policemen, compared to 401 summonses in the same period in 2013, according to police data. There were only 10 summonses issued last week, compared to 405 a year earlier.New York Police Commissioner William Bratton confirmed for the first time on Friday that there has been a widespread work slowdown by police officers. Police unions deny orchestrating any slowdown. SPOT THE COPMarcy Houses resident Nisaa, a 22-year-old black woman who declined to give her last name, pointed to a nearby street corner and said that until a few weeks ago, there was always a patrol car parked there.She thought the decrease in police presence was a good thing because so many of Marcy's residents feared confrontations with the cops. ""It actually makes people feel better,"" she said.Before the December shooting, patrol cars could be seen parked in regular spots along the perimeter of the eight-block compound. Police officers were often seen on the rooftops of the buildings and on foot throughout the complex, according to residents.On Thursday, there were no marked police cars parked in the spots some residents said were their normal posts. One NYPD patrol car circled the complex but did not stop.""I drive my husband to work every morning at 3 a.m. and when I would come back they would be there,"" said Luz Delia, 34, pointing to a parking spot along the edge of the complex. She said she liked parking her car and going back into her apartment knowing they were there. ""I used to feel more safe.""There was no immediate comment from the NYPD.The president of the Police Benevolent Association Patrick Lynch has said the union has not initiated or supported a slowdown, but experts say officers do have discretion in how they choose to enforce some infractions.If police officers are engaged in a slowdown, it could backfire if it continues, said Robert Snyder, an associate professor at Rutgers University who has written about police and community relations.""Police officers are not going to look good if they put on their uniform on and don't fight crime,"" Snyder said.TOO AFRAID TO GO OUTMore than 11 miles from Marcy Houses lies Mott Haven in the South Bronx. The shops that line the main street of this poor neighborhood, population 91,000, are rarely the name-brand national chains, while music in Spanish spills out onto the streets from small stores.Take the No. 6 train from Manhattan and into the Bronx, and the cars slowly become less white. The Bronx area that includes Mott Haven is almost exclusively black or Latino, according to a Census survey.Just a few minutes of conversation with residents in the neighborhood is enough to draw out stories of shootings, stabbings, murder, or other violent crime, either experienced personally or witnessed. Police stops are considered a normal part of life, just another every day occurrence.Yahaira Quinones, 37, said her building was normally patrolled by police under the Clean Halls crime prevention program but ""I haven't seen that in a while.""She has also noticed fewer police officers in her neighborhood lately. In the past, if she needed to send her teenage daughter to the corner store, she would wait until she saw a cop on the street. Now, she doesn't feel safe sending her daughter out alone any more.While crime in the Bronx has plummeted in recent years, residents in Mott Haven remain wary. Some of those interviewed said they simply try to socialize elsewhere and keep themselves and their children off the streets.Not everyone sees a change in the police presence, and some of those that do are glad that there are fewer officers on the streets because they perceive police stops as demeaning.Marissa Rivadeneira, 22, said she has definitely noticed fewer police around Mott Haven. She is now afraid when she walks home late at night from the subway station.Rivadeneira used to call her mother on her way home, but now does not want to pull out her cellphone. When asked if her mother worries about her, Rivadeneira said, ""Yeah, she does."" (Additional reporting by Samantha Sunne and Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Ross Colvin and Tiffany Wu)"

Chewy Chocolate Chip Granola BarsGranola bars are a staple in my pantry, but between my husband, my kids, and my kids' hungry friends, I can't seem to keep enough of them in the house. So I figured it was time to try and make them from scratch, and maybe even sneak in some health food. After many trials, I finally cracked the code and came up with a version that puts all those store-bought bars to shame. What's more, they're no-bake and take only ten minutes to make. GET THE RECIPE2. Amish-Style Baked Oatmeal with Walnuts & RaisinsBaked oatmeal is a comforting Amish breakfast casserole. Unlike regular oatmeal, which is made on the stovetop and has a porridge-like consistency, baked oatmeal is made in the oven and has consistency similar to that of bread pudding. There are endless variations -- the recipe is easily adapted with whatever fruits and nuts you have on hand -- but this version filled with tart apples and plump raisins with a crunchy walnut topping is my favorite. The best part? It can be made ahead of time and reheated. GET THE RECIPE3. Banana Oatmeal CookiesCrispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, these are the most delicious cookies! They taste just like banana bread. GET THE RECIPE4. Homemade GranolaThis recipe was inspired by the homemade granola served The Inn at Occidental in Sonoma County, CA. With crispy clusters of old-fashioned oats, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, toasted coconut, golden honey and wheat germ, it's both delicious and nutritious. GET THE RECIPE5. Oatmeal, Maple & Pecan Scones with Pecans & CurrantsThese comforting breakfast treats are like a cross between scones and oatmeal cookies: buttery and tender on the inside, crisp and craggy on the outside, and chockfull of oats, pecans and currants. The recipe is the first I tried from Joanne Chang's wonderful cookbook, Flour: Spectacular Recipes from Boston's Bakery & Cafe, and it was love at first bite. GET THE RECIPE6. Steel Cut Oatmeal with Maple Syrup, Currants & CoconutSteel cut oats have a wonderfully hearty and chewy texture. They're less processed than rolled or instant oats, which are steamed and rolled into flakes, so they take a bit longer to cook -- perfect for lazy weekend mornings. In this recipe, I simmer them in a lot of liquid so they get super creamy, almost like a breakfast risotto. Yum! GET THE RECIPE7. Crispy Honey Nut Granola BarsFor me, this is the end-all, be-all crispy granola bar. The secret ingredient (believe it or not) is Rice Krispies, which make them wonderfully light and crispy. If you can imagine what a cross between a granola bar and Rice Krispy Treat would taste like, this is it. GET THE RECIPE8. Secret Ingredient Chocolate Chip CookiesIn the food world, there are few things as elusive or sought after as the perfect chocolate chip cookie. This recipe from my friend Carrie has my vote. When she first sent it to me, I thought Geez, she sure threw the whole kitchen sink in there. But Carrie is a great baker so I tried them, and I don't think I've ever had a better chocolate chip cookie. GET THE RECIPE"

She stands accused of conspiring to kill Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro. Another opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez, has already been imprisoned.Through its cohorts and directly, Cuba has been pounding democratic institutions not only in Venezuela, but also Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua. Democracy's advocates in the region are too shortsighted, beleaguered or intimidated to fight back aggressively. In fact, they invited Cuba to participate in the upcoming Summit of the Americas in Panama, despite the fact that Cuba's Castro dictatorship openly scorns the ""democracy clause"" that reserves Summit membership and participation to the region's democratic governments. Thirty-four of the 35 nations comprising the Western Hemisphere adopted that clause during the Quebec Summit. Cuba was then and still is the Hemisphere's last remaining totalitarian state; it also has a long history of ""exporting revolution"" into democratic states.The Obama Administration initially stated its opposition to Cuba being invited to the Summit. However, in a turn-around announcement on December 17, it chose to ""lead from behind"" and acquiesce to the whims of those hemispheric leaders all-too-eager and willing to suspend the ""democracy clause."" Not only has President Obama now accepted Cuba's participation, but he will also be there to personally welcome dictator Raul Castro.However, those who lobbied Obama to attend the Summit regardless of the violation of the ""democracy clause"" weren't to be satisfied with his attendance alone. They also wanted the President to arrive with a gift bag for Cuba that includes a further lifting of U.S. sanctions. That, they argued, will ensure a warm reception for Obama from ""troubled"" Latin American leaders. And naturally, Castro would be thrilled.If this sounds familiar, it's because the exact same arguments were made in the months and weeks leading up to the 2009 Summit of the Americas in Trinidad. Just days before that summit, the Obama Administration did ease sanctions against Cuba. Despite this ""gesture,"" Obama was not received in Trinidad as a hero. He was treated as a pushover. Then Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez even engineered a photo-op with the President that featured copies of anti-American book, Open Veins of Latin America. Latin America's ""extreme Left"" considers the book to be its bible. (The author, Eduardo Galeano, has recently disavowed his creation.) A few months after that summit, the Cuban government of Raul Castro seized an American hostage, Alan Gross, in a successful effort to coerce the United States into releasing a group of imprisoned Cuban spies.For months, advocates for lifting sanctions used the Panama Summit as a prop in their campaign against what they call the United States' ""failed policy."" They would happily sacrifice our national interest in regional democracy to advance their narrow agenda. Not only is this dangerous and irresponsible, it also begs the serious question: What do they consider to be a ""successful"" policy alternative?Is it the ""China model,"" whereby U.S. business helps to build the most lucrative dictatorship in human history?A ""Vietnam model"" of state capitalism under an iron-fisted rule?A ""Burma model,"" whereby reforms achieved through pressure are rolled back as soon as sanctions are lifted?Raul Castro, Nicolas Maduro and their puppets revel in such models. But none should have a place -- geographically or politically -- in the Western Hemisphere. In this hemisphere, every nation (except Cuba) made a commitment to representative democracy in 2001. It was a historic commitment that, backed by the United States, has blocked the authoritarian ambitions of wannabe dictators in Latin America and generated continued support for democracy and civil society. It was a commitment that Obama's December 17 announcement has now placed on the chopping block.This post is part of a Huffington Post blog series called ""90 Miles: Rethinking the Future of U.S.-Cuba Relations.""

Gwen Pang, secretary general of the Philippine Red Cross, said workers treated 986 people for cuts, bruises and dizziness.Despite the casualties, Moreno said the procession has been generally peaceful.She said any emergencies will help the Red Cross prepare for the papal visit. At least 20 field hospitals will be established in Manila next week, including one with an operating room, she said.""This is like a mini-papal event in scope,"" police Senior Superintendent Jigs Coronel said. ""We'll be able to put to a test our security plans, crowd control, anti-crime measures, emergency and medical response.""The statue of Christ, crowned with thorns, is believed to have been brought from Mexico to Manila on a galleon in 1606 by Spanish missionaries. The ship caught fire, charring the statue that was named the Black Nazarene. Some believe that mystical powers have allowed the statue to withstand fires, earthquakes and even intense bombings during World War II.Police say up to 1 million people joined or watched the procession, but crowds have thinned to a little over 900.000 by Friday evening. Officials and church leaders expect millions will show up for the Jan. 15-19 papal visit.About 5,000 police were deployed for the daylong event Friday, with 1,000 military personnel on standby, Coronel said.Crowds threw small white towels at volunteers manning the statue's carriage to wipe parts of the cross and the statue in the belief by devotees that the Black Nazarene's mystical powers will rub off on them.Mary Rose Ricafort carried a small replica of the Black Nazarene as she followed the procession. ""I want my father to get well,"" she said, adding he had suffered a stroke.Joel Talaban, a 51-year-old storeowner, said he has been a devotee for three years and hopes that by finishing the procession ""I will be able to give a good life to my children and keep them away from vices, and also to ask for our daily sustenance.""The procession is slowly snaking through crowds along 7 kilometers (4 miles) of streets before ending at Quiapo Church, home of the Black Nazarene in central Manila.

Europeans, Asians, and Africans ask us to explain everything that baffles them about the increasingly odd and troubling conduct of the United States. Polite people, normally reluctant to risk offending a guest, complain that America’s trigger-happiness, cutthroat free-marketeering, and “exceptionality” have gone on for too long to be considered just an adolescent phase. Which means that we Americans abroad are regularly asked to account for the behavior of our rebranded “homeland,” now conspicuously in decline and increasingly out of step with the rest of the world.In my long nomadic life, I’ve had the good fortune to live, work, or travel in all but a handful of countries on this planet. I’ve been to both poles and a great many places in between, and nosy as I am, I’ve talked with people all along the way. I still remember a time when to be an American was to be envied. The country where I grew up after World War II seemed to be respected and admired around the world for way too many reasons to go into here.That’s changed, of course. Even after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, I still met people -- in the Middle East, no less -- willing to withhold judgment on the U.S. Many thought that the Supreme Court’s installation of George W. Bush as president was a blunder American voters would correct in the election of 2004. His return to office truly spelled the end of America as the world had known it. Bush had started a war, opposed by the entire world, because he wanted to and he could. A majority of Americans supported him. And that was when all the uncomfortable questions really began.In the early fall of 2014, I traveled from my home in Oslo, Norway, through much of Eastern and Central Europe. Everywhere I went in those two months, moments after locals realized I was an American the questions started and, polite as they usually were, most of them had a single underlying theme: Have Americans gone over the edge? Are you crazy? Please explain.Then recently, I traveled back to the “homeland.” It struck me there that most Americans have no idea just how strange we now seem to much of the world. In my experience, foreign observers are far better informed about us than the average American is about them. This is partly because the “news” in the American media is so parochial and so limited in its views both of how we act and how other countries think -- even countries with which we were recently, are currently, or threaten soon to be at war. America’s belligerence alone, not to mention its financial acrobatics, compels the rest of the world to keep close track of us. Who knows, after all, what conflict the Americans may drag you into next, as target or reluctant ally?So wherever we expatriates settle on the planet, we find someone who wants to talk about the latest American events, large and small: another country bombed in the name of our “national security,” another peaceful protest march attacked by our increasingly militarized police, another diatribe against “big government” by yet another wannabe candidate who hopes to head that very government in Washington. Such news leaves foreign audiences puzzled and full of trepidation.Question TimeTake the questions stumping Europeans in the Obama years (which 1.6 million Americans residing in Europe regularly find thrown our way). At the absolute top of the list: “Why would anyone oppose national health care?” European and other industrialized countries have had some form of national health care since the 1930s or 1940s, Germany since 1880. Some versions, as in France and Great Britain, have devolved into two-tier public and private systems. Yet even the privileged who pay for a faster track would not begrudge their fellow citizens government-funded comprehensive health care. That so many Americans do strikes Europeans as baffling, if not frankly brutal. In the Scandinavian countries, long considered to be the most socially advanced in the world, a national (physical and mental) health program, funded by the state, is a big part -- but only a part -- of a more general social welfare system. In Norway, where I live, all citizens also have an equal right to education (state subsidized preschool from age one, and free schools from age six through specialty training or university education and beyond), unemployment benefits, job-placement and paid retraining services, paid parental leave, old age pensions, and more. These benefits are not merely an emergency “safety net”; that is, charitable payments grudgingly bestowed upon the needy. They are universal: equally available to all citizens as human rights encouraging social harmony -- or as our own U.S. constitution would put it, “domestic tranquility.” It’s no wonder that, for many years, international evaluators have ranked Norway as the best place to grow old, to be a woman, and to raise a child. The title of “best” or “happiest” place to live on Earth comes down to a neighborly contest among Norway and the other Nordic social democracies, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland.In Norway, all benefits are paid for mainly by high taxation. Compared to the mind-numbing enigma of the U.S. tax code, Norway’s is remarkably straightforward, taxing income from labor and pensions progressively, so that those with higher incomes pay more. The tax department does the calculations, sends an annual bill, and taxpayers, though free to dispute the sum, willingly pay up, knowing what they and their children get in return. And because government policies effectively redistribute wealth and tend to narrow the country’s slim income gap, most Norwegians sail pretty comfortably in the same boat. (Think about that!)Life and LibertyThis system didn’t just happen. It was planned. Sweden led the way in the 1930s, and all five Nordic countries pitched in during the postwar period to develop their own variations of what came to be called the Nordic Model: a balance of regulated capitalism, universal social welfare, political democracy, and the highest levels of gender and economic equality on the planet. It’s their system. They invented it. They like it. Despite the efforts of an occasional conservative government to muck it up, they maintain it. Why?In all the Nordic countries, there is broad general agreement across the political spectrum that only when people’s basic needs are met -- when they can cease to worry about their jobs, their incomes, their housing, their transportation, their health care, their kids’ education, and their aging parents -- only then can they be free to do as they like. While the U.S. settles for the fantasy that, from birth, every kid has an equal shot at the American dream, Nordic social welfare systems lay the foundations for a more authentic equality and individualism.These ideas are not novel. They are implied in the preamble to our own Constitution. You know, the part about “we the People” forming “a more perfect Union” to “promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.” Even as he prepared the nation for war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt memorably specified components of what that general welfare should be in his State of the Union address in 1941. Among the “simple basic things that must never be lost sight of,” he listed “equality of opportunity for youth and others, jobs for those who can work, security for those who need it, the ending of special privileges for the few, the preservation of civil liberties for all,” and oh yes, higher taxes to pay for those things and for the cost of defensive armaments.Knowing that Americans used to support such ideas, a Norwegian today is appalled to learn that a CEO of a major American corporation makes between 300 and 400 times as much as its average employee. Or that governors Sam Brownback of Kansas and Chris Christie of New Jersey, having run up their state’s debts by cutting taxes for the rich, now plan to cover the loss with money snatched from the pension funds of workers in the public sector. To a Norwegian, the job of government is to distribute the country’s good fortune reasonably equally, not send it zooming upward, as in America today, to a sticky-fingered one percent.In their planning, Norwegians tend to do things slowly, always thinking of the long term, envisioning what a better life might be for their children, their posterity. That’s why a Norwegian, or any northern European, is aghast to learn that two-thirds of American college students finish their education in the red, some owing $100,000 or more. Or that in the U.S., still the world’s richest country, one in three children lives in poverty, along with one in five young people between the ages of 18 and 34. Or that America’s recent multi-trillion-dollar wars were fought on a credit card to be paid off by our kids. Which brings us back to that word: brutal.Implications of brutality, or of a kind of uncivilized inhumanity, seem to lurk in so many other questions foreign observers ask about America like: How could you set up that concentration camp in Cuba, and why can’t you shut it down? Or: How can you pretend to be a Christian country and still carry out the death penalty? The follow-up to which often is: How could you pick as president a man proud of executing his fellow citizens at the fastest rate recorded in Texas history? (Europeans will not soon forget George W. Bush.)Other things I've had to answer for include:* Why can’t you Americans stop interfering with women’s health care?* Why can’t you understand science?* How can you still be so blind to the reality of climate change?* How can you speak of the rule of law when your presidents break international laws to make war whenever they want?* How can you hand over the power to blow up the planet to one lone, ordinary man?* How can you throw away the Geneva Conventions and your principles to advocate torture?* Why do you Americans like guns so much? Why do you kill each other at such a rate?To many, the most baffling and important question of all is: Why do you send your military all over the world to stir up more and more trouble for all of us?That last question is particularly pressing because countries historically friendly to the United States, from Australia to Finland, are struggling to keep up with an influx of refugees from America’s wars and interventions. Throughout Western Europe and Scandinavia, right-wing parties that have scarcely or never played a role in government are now rising rapidly on a wave of opposition to long-established immigration policies. Only last month, such a party almost toppled the sitting social democratic government of Sweden, a generous country that has absorbed more than its fair share of asylum seekers fleeing the shock waves of “the finest fighting force that the world has ever known.”The Way We AreEuropeans understand, as it seems Americans do not, the intimate connection between a country’s domestic and foreign policies. They often trace America’s reckless conduct abroad to its refusal to put its own house in order. They’ve watched the United States unravel its flimsy safety net, fail to replace its decaying infrastructure, disempower most of its organized labor, diminish its schools, bring its national legislature to a standstill, and create the greatest degree of economic and social inequality in almost a century. They understand why Americans, who have ever less personal security and next to no social welfare system, are becoming more anxious and fearful. They understand as well why so many Americans have lost trust in a government that has done so little new for them over the past three decades or more, except for Obama’s endlessly embattled health care effort, which seems to most Europeans a pathetically modest proposal.What baffles so many of them, though, is how ordinary Americans in startling numbers have been persuaded to dislike “big government” and yet support its new representatives, bought and paid for by the rich. How to explain that? In Norway’s capital, where a statue of a contemplative President Roosevelt overlooks the harbor, many America-watchers think he may have been the last U.S. president who understood and could explain to the citizenry what government might do for all of them. Struggling Americans, having forgotten all that, take aim at unknown enemies far away -- or on the far side of their own towns. It’s hard to know why we are the way we are, and -- believe me -- even harder to explain it to others. Crazy may be too strong a word, too broad and vague to pin down the problem. Some people who question me say that the U.S. is “paranoid,” “backward,” “behind the times,” “vain,” “greedy,” “self-absorbed,” or simply “dumb.” Others, more charitably, imply that Americans are merely “ill-informed,” “misguided,” “misled,” or “asleep,” and could still recover sanity. But wherever I travel, the questions follow, suggesting that the United States, if not exactly crazy, is decidedly a danger to itself and others. It’s past time to wake up, America, and look around. There’s another world out here, an old and friendly one across the ocean, and it’s full of good ideas, tried and true.Ann Jones, a TomDispatch regular, is the author of Kabul in Winter: Life Without Peace in Afghanistan, among other books, and most recently They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story, a Dispatch Books project.Follow TomDispatch on Twitter and join us on Facebook.

The organization had argued that the information in the files, which date back more than decade, was not relevant to the California case, the Times said.The court could not be reached to confirm the ruling.Attempts to reach the family's attorney on Saturday were not successful.Prosecutors, representing the family of a man who was abused at age 13 by a Scout leader, successfully argued that the files could show the organization routinely used secrecy to handle such allegations and attempted to hide information about abusers from the parents and guardians of Scouts, the Times said.The lawsuit contends that a Scout official attempted to stop the mother of the former Scout, now 20, from reporting the alleged abuse to police in 2007, the Times said. It also claims other Scout officials knew or should have known about the alleged abuse. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages.The Boy Scouts has previously been forced to release files containing information about sexual abuse claims.In 2012, roughly 20,000 pages of files, spanning from 1965 to 1985, were released by order of the Oregon Supreme Court, after a jury found the Scouts liable in a 1980s pedophile case and ordered it to pay $20 million in damages.

Michael Hayden, a former director of both the CIA and the U.S. National Security Agency. ""Invariably, you do have something. It's inevitable.""Bruce Riedel, a former top CIA analyst, said: ""The problem for the French intelligence and security services is that there are so many French citizens who have gone to Syria or Iraq or elsewhere to join the jihad and then come home that they can not monitor all of them 24 hours a day.""""If they have not broken any laws, intelligence services in the democratic world cannot arrest you or follow you constantly just because you are a fanatic jihadist,"" Riedel said.""Intelligence is not going to predict when a fanatic goes from being a radical thinker to a violent terrorist in most cases,"" Riedel said.French and U.S. spy agencies several years ago classified Said and Cherif Kouachi, the brothers believed to have attacked the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in Paris, as very high priority terrorism suspects, European and U.S. officials said.Their names were entered into TIDE, a classified database of 1.2 million individuals the United States considers terrorism suspects, and the smaller ""no fly"" list barring them from boarding flights to or in America, two U.S. officials said.They had been designated high-priority targets for surveillance after Cherif was implicated in a group recruiting French fighters for an Al Qaeda affiliate in Iraq, and Said went to train with al Qaeda in Yemen in 2011, officials said.But the U.S. and European officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said French authorities scaled back monitoring of the Kouachis when they kept a low profile during the last few years. LONG TERM PLANS?The officials said that after Said returned from Yemen, the Kouachis appear to have consciously avoided contact with others they knew to be under surveillance. The officials said this suggested in hindsight that they might have been planning to mount an attack for years.The U.S. and European security officials said law enforcement and spy agencies have to prioritize which suspects to monitor closely because of the huge number of potential suspects, and such surveillance requires considerable manpower.Agencies have to assign as many as 30 personnel each day to watch a single suspect and follow any suspicious contacts he or she might meet.The challenge has been complicated by thousands of foreigners who have gone to join Syria-based militant Islamic groups such as Islamic State and Nusrah, many of whom are now returning to their homeland with battlefield experience.Investigations following actual or attempted attacks by militants regularly show that spy agencies had advance information that would have indicated the suspects posed an imminent threat if the bits of data had been properly connected.After the Sept. 11 attacks, investigations established that the CIA and FBI both had early clues to the identities of some of the men who hijacked the planes and flew them into the World Trade center and the Pentagon.But the information, including that they had militant connections, was not properly shared.Parliamentary investigations showed that British agencies had collected intelligence on two of the four men who bombed London's underground system in July 2005 in an earlier counter-terrorism investigation. But before the bombings, spy agencies never deemed the suspects high-priority targets for monitoring.There were similar circumstances surrounding two other men who plotted against the United States - an Army psychiatrist who killed 13 in a mass shootings at Ft. Hood army base in 2009 and a Nigerian who narrowly failed to bring down an airliner headed for Detroit with a bomb in his underwear.U.S. agencies already had some intelligence tying each man to the same al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen that investigators have linked to Said Kouachi. But the clues were not assembled into a pattern until after the attacks were launched. (Reporting By Mark Hosenball; Editing by David Story and Ken Wills)"

AFP PHOTO/MANDEL NGAN (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e3b31f000025012578d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some 9 million Americans could attend community college tuition-free under a proposal President Barack Obama announced Friday.His plan, which is subject to approval by Congress and depends on the participation of state governments, would dedicate some $60 billion over the next decade to defray tuition and fees for anyone who attends school at least half-time, maintains a roughly C+ average, and is on track to complete their program or transfer to a four-year school. The federal government would kick in about 75 percent of the cost, while participating states would pick up the rest. For the neediest students, Pell grants would help pay for transportation, room and board, and other costs associated with attending college.Student advocates said the plan could boost college enrollment, slow the growth of student debt, put dodgy for-profit colleges out of business, and force schools, state governments and local governments to dedicate more resources to helping students attain a college degree.“Think about it: Students who started at community colleges during those two years, and then go on to a four-year institution -- they essentially get the first half of their bachelor’s degree for free,” Obama told an audience at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tennessee. “People who enroll for skills training will graduate already ready to work, and they won’t have a pile of student debt.”For an administration that has struggled to help student loan borrowers or crack down on wayward colleges and student loan contractors that waste taxpayer funds, student advocates said that the mere fact that Obama was proposing free higher education represented progress in their fight for reduced debt burdens and lower tuition costs. Even if Obama leaves the White House in January 2017 without having seen his proposal passed into law, they said, future Democratic leaders likely would have to embrace it as part of their own plan to aid students and families.“Two years of college will become as free and universal as high school is today,” Obama said. His education secretary, Arne Duncan, said on Twitter: “Just as free K-12 education is an educational and civil right, #FreeCommunityCollege should be as well.”It faces an uphill climb. Influential Washington Republicans immediately pounced on the idea, dismissing it as federal overreach. Congress has declined to approve previous community college-oriented proposals from the Obama administration.And even though the plan is similar to one adopted by Tennessee -- the site of Obama’s address Friday -- the state’s senior U.S. senator, Lamar Alexander, said he wouldn’t support it because the federal government shouldn’t get involved. Alexander, a Republican, this week became the new chair of the Senate education committee.With Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, political analysts said the measure has little chance of being enacted into law.The plan does nothing for existing students. As a result of reduced state funding for higher education and recent moves by Washington to reduce federal spending, those students have had to contend with a shrinking pot of money to aid them as they complete their degrees. It also fails to help borrowers with student loans, of which there are 40 million who collectively carry more than $1.3 trillion in unpaid education debts.“As a borrower with student loan debt, I am still awaiting the proposal that will help existing borrowers like me,” said Natalia Abrams, executive director of the activist group Student Debt Crisis.The White House declined to provide more details about the proposal, which Obama said he’ll highlight again during his upcoming State of the Union address. The administration said it will reveal more details of the plan, and how it plans to pay for it, in the coming weeks as part of its budget for the next fiscal year.Students paid community colleges $16.7 billion in tuition and fees in 2012, comprising nearly 30 percent, or the largest portion, of their total revenue during the most recent year for which data is available, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.The average community college is charging students about $3,347 in tuition and fees this academic year, the trade group said. That represents about 21 percent of the typical student's cost to attend community college, or about $16,325.For-profit colleges, which compete with community colleges for non-traditional and vocational students, and generally charge much higher rates, would be among the losers if Obama's plan became law.Investors in publicly-traded for-profit colleges reacted by sending shares of the biggest for-profit education companies down by as much as 6 percent on Friday, far exceeding the slight drops in U.S. equity benchmarks. The Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, the trade group representing for-profit schools, did not return a request for comment.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), a frequent critic of proprietary schools, praised Obama's plan for steering students toward community colleges, which he said are ""a more affordable, higher quality alternative to for-profit colleges.""Students would benefit beyond the promise of free tuition. For example, improved coordination between community colleges and public four-year schools as a result of Obama’s plan could help transfer students avoid having to spend unnecessary money to repeat coursework. House Democrats said last year that some 15 percent of transfer students lost at least 90 percent of their community college credits when moving to their new school.Obama’s plan could benefit the broader American economy thanks to a better-educated workforce, which he said was key to the nation’s ability to compete in the global economy.“In the new economy, jobs and businesses will go wherever the most skilled, best-educated workforce resides. Because businesses are mobile now. Technology means they can locate anywhere. And where they have the most educated, most adaptable, most nimble workforce, that's where they’re going to locate. And I want them to look no further than the United States of America,” Obama said.Experts said his plan could also help lower-income students overcome the perception that college was out of reach.“This sends a clear message that community college is an affordable option for all students. Even though tuition and fees make up a small portion of the total cost of attendance -- and it is unclear if all students will see additional savings from this plan -- telling students early on that tuition will be free may induce more to prepare for college and eventually enroll,” said Robert Kelchen, a professor at Seton Hall University who specializes in higher education finance.To Ben Miller, a former adviser to Arne Duncan, one of the plan’s best features lies in the message it sends to states, namely that they can’t keep cutting funding for higher education.""It's not the free part that stands out. It's the formal financial requirement for states to fund their higher education institutions,"" said Miller, a senior policy analyst at the Washington-based New America Foundation who previously worked at the Education Department. ""It's the first time from the federal government, this stated notion that states have an actual obligation in a formal sense for supporting their higher education. States been free for decades to cut or fund higher education on their whims.""The Government Accountability Office in a report last month said that in the decade ending in 2012 tuition and fees from students overtook state funds as the larger source of revenue for public colleges.Obama’s plan, if enacted, risks subsidizing students from higher-income families who may not need help from taxpayers. Debbie Cochrane, research director for the California-based Institute for College Access & Success, said making tuition free for all students represents “a missed opportunity to focus resources on the students who need aid the most.”Cochrane pointed to California’s community colleges, which she said offer the lowest tuition rates in the nation and fee waivers for low-income students, as an example of why a free tuition plan may not help the neediest students. Few low-income students apply for federal student aid at California’s community colleges, and part-time enrollment is high.“Obama probably won’t get this done in the next couple years, but he’s laying the groundwork with his message,” said Sara Goldrick-Rab, an education policy expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who for years has advocated for free tuition during students’ first two years in college. “We didn’t get free high school overnight.”"
