0,STYLE & BEAUTY,I Regret Selling My Wedding Shoes On eBay (PHOTOS),"Christina Anderson, Contributor
Editorial Director, Parents; The Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wedding-shoes-sell-on-ebay_us_5b9c826ce4b03a1dcc7f4f42,I had the perfect thing to complete the fairy tale... and then I sold it.,2012-11-13,Those gorgeous shoes? This is the only photo where you can barely see them. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c826c25000032003617c7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"I was working as a fashion assistant at Harper's Bazaar when I got engaged. My colleagues pooled their money and gave me the most wonderful gift a bride-to-be could ever want: a pair of white, peau de soie Manolo Blahnik slingback heels. My gown was purchased and in the hands of a talented tailor, the location and menu was set by my fastidious wedding planner (my mother) and, like Cinderella, I had the perfect shoes to complete the fairy tale that I was sure my wedding day would be. Just as I hoped, the day was perfect. My toes did go numb as my father walked me down the aisle, but I like to think that was nerves rather than pure discomfort. My husband and I said our vows and then went on to dance the night away at our reception. I mingled with guests on the grassy lawn and I remember thinking, ""Ooh, my silk heels are sinking into the grass. F---- it, it's my wedding!"" At some point I tossed those precious pumps off so I could boogie down on the dance floor. Weeks later, we returned from our honeymoon and life returned to normal. My husband and I both went back to work, regaled friends with stories of the wedding and our trip to Mexico and basically got on with the business of being married. At the time, I was in the habit of selling clothes and accessories on eBay to make some money (so I could buy more clothes and accessories that I would later sell on eBay). As I looked at my Manolo Blahniks, now sullied with a night's worth of partying, I shrugged my shoulders and thought, ""Why not? I could use the extra cash."" I listed them on eBay, and as with any big name accessories (Christian Louboutin, Chanel, Jimmy Choo -- any prominent designer goods get snatched up pretty fast), they were quickly purchased my a young woman in Australia. I packed them up and bid my wedding shoes adieu. My husband and I are coming up on our ninth wedding anniversary and I feel a pang of regret at having sold my bridal shoes. While I may not have ever worn them again (I'm not really a slingbacks kinda gal), they were such a pretty reminder of one of the best days of my life. I did keep my wedding dress, but it's preserved and boxed up on a shelf in my house. So the next time I'll lay my eyes on the gown will be when my daughter (hopefully) wears it for her wedding. Who knows, maybe I would have dyed my shoes navy and worn them again. Or set them atop a pile of coffee table books to be admired like objets d'art. Whatever the case, I made a rash decision and got rid of something that I wish I hadn't. With that lesson learned I now keep all of my designer clothes and shoes, no matter how old. I figure someone will wear them again one day. Want more? Be sure to check out HuffPost Style on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest and Instagram at @HuffPostStyle."

On a balmy November afternoon, designer L'Wren Scott (and Mick Jagger's longtime girlfriend) hosted a presentation for her spring 2013 collection while also debuting her first eyewear line. The large room featured lush red carpets, embroidered chairs, red velvet cupcakes and of course, beautiful clothing and accessories (the designer is known for her sleek silhouettes and body-hugging dresses -- in fact she is rumored to be designing Angelina Jolie's wedding dress). In the midst of the extravaganza stood the designer herself busily talking to the press, fixing displays and fussing over her models. She was a vision in a long burgundy velvet dress that hugged her slim figure while her dark locks framed her flawless skin (she credits her glowing complexion to her three favorite beauty products: ""Caudalie Beauty Elixir, Rodin skin oil and Dr Colbert serum""). Whatever she is using seems to be working, having just flown from Paris to New York the day before, she looked well-rested and rejuvenated. With her long legs and tall stature (she is 6'3"" to be exact) it was impossible to tear your eyes away from the ex-model (who even gave herself a boost with a pair of 3"" pumps.) Although the elaborate clothes that lined the room were hard to miss, the beautiful sunglass collection (cleverly displayed on cake trays) was the main attraction. L'Wren has been designing for years -- First Lady Michelle Obama wears her clothes (most recently to vote!) Nicole Kidman is often spotted on the red carpet in her designs. So why did she just branch into eyewear now? ""Well I'm never in a rush to finish a line,"" she explained, ""and I always think you have to wait until you think it's the right moment for you and your customer. I love to listen to what my customers' needs are."" After seven years, it finally seemed like the right time. L'Wren was hesitant to pick out her favorite pair of sunnies, but did cite a gold cat-eye pair as ones she was particularly fond of (we couldn't get enough of the lacy cut-out frames ourselves). With a successful fashion career and a personal life that is constantly splashed all over the tabloids, it's hard to imagine the two don't fuse together at some point. When asked how Mick has influenced her style (the pair have been dating for almost 12 years now), Scott declined to comment, saying ""I've been having my own style for a while."" Fair enough--we love an independent woman. Want more? Be sure to check out HuffPost Style on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest and Instagram at @HuffPostStyle."

These days, it's not his permission you're asking for, but his blessing. It might be an old-fashioned tradition, but it lets your future father-in-law know that you're well intentioned and sincere -- plus, it can be a great bonding experience for you two. Share with him your feelings for his daughter, your understanding of the commitment, and the excitement you have to make his daughter happy for the rest of her life.Asking Her Finding the right words to say to Dad probably called for a few conversations in the mirror, but don't walk away too quickly -- you've got one more to practice. Along with the magical four-word question, prepare a short, extremely personal speech and rehearse it. Don't use clichéd, ever-cheesy phrases like ""I want to wake up next to you for the rest of my life,"" or ""you'll make me the happiest man alive."" This is your soul mate -- tell her what made you fall in love with her, what your favorite memory is, what you picture your life together as. And finally, look directly into her eyes and be confident. She's going to say ""yes,"" I promise. The Plan Planning the perfect proposal is unique to each couple's personality and only you know your lady best. If she wants to climb to Mount Everest for her ring, arrange the Sherpa. If a home-cooked meal sounds more like heaven, bring out the baking tray. The one thing you must absolutely do is: make it a surprise. Even if you two picked the ring out together, make sure she has no idea the actual proposal moment is coming.Also, if you're having trouble putting all the pieces together, you may want to enlist a proposal planner to help out. Your planner will get to know you and your relationship, offer imaginative, unique ideas, and help make the moment flawless.Catch it on camera Men, I don't care how you do it, but catch it on camera. On film, on your iPhone, on a security camera, on your GoPro -- catch it. Your soon-to-be fiancé's reaction will be priceless. For example:I do recommend having it photographed professionally, and make sure it's done discreetly. It's a lot easier to get candid photos if you propose during the day, as you don't want camera flashes ruining the moment or surprise.Friends and Family This, again, is a very personal decision. If your soon-to-be fiancé is close with her friends and family, strongly consider incorporating them into the proposal. I suggest you ask the actual question privately and intimately, then surprise her with a small celebration of friends and family after. Think the tears came down hard when you hit one knee? You'll see a flood when she turns around to Mom and Dad. Case in point:One last word: this is just as much your special moment as it is hers. If you feel your heart beat out of your chest, let it.

5,TRAVEL,Preserving Traditional Craft And Social Responsibility All In One Brand,"Mehdy Ghannad, Contributor
International Travel Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ethnotek-social-responsibility-travel_us_5b9c748ce4b03a1dcc7ecde2,Many companies and start-ups are re-evaluating their business models in hopes to make a more lasting impact on the global economy by focusing their efforts to become more sustainable. Shifting to a supply chain sustainable strategy must come from the top down.,2012-11-12,"Master weaver of the Bhujodi Village, Gujarat, India",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c748b2000004e00fd93a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Today's corporate landscape has had its pitfalls with companies taking superfluous risk all in the hopes of making that quick buck. But what about a socially minded capitalist -- or better yet socially minded companies? Yes -- they are out there, and this new trend of entrepreneurs are becoming more common in this new economical renaissance we are having in the United States. Many companies and start-ups are re-evaluating their business models in hopes to make a more lasting impact on the global economy by focusing their efforts to become more sustainable. It is a difficult task for CEOs and other executives as they try to steer their companies towards these models, as they can't be short sighted in their decision-making by reacting to market trends in the short term, especially with the current economic crisis. Shifting to a supply chain sustainable strategy must come from the top down. But the real questions is: Are these companies doing this truly to be sustainable or just to market themselves as such in order to get that quick sale? We are all familiar with the Chinese proverb, ""Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime."" This proverb is something to really consider when a company markets itself as a sustainable company or one that claims to follows this model. As avid travelers, we tend to seek out culture and environment -- preserved traditions and natural beauty. However, as a result of the expanding corporate economy, this richness that a traveler takes away from their jet-setting adventures is slowly diminishing from the world. Few incentives have been put in place by the government for companies to reduce their global footprint and support world communities. The responsibility now falls to the consumer, or in this case the traveler, to be conscious enough to make environmentally aware and socially responsible decisions while exploring the world.Travelers and adventure-seekers will agree that one of the most essential items for travel is a sturdy backpack. Ethnotek, founded by fellow travelers and vagabonds based out of Minnesota, is a backpack company that has taken on this commission of creating a business model that aligns with global social awareness. Co-founded by Jake Orak, inspiration for the organization first came during an adventure Orak undertook in 2007 to Vietnam. During the excursion he came across the Hmong hill tribe and uncovered their embroidered fabrics, each telling a unique story about village life. Orak quickly fell in love with the fabrics and created a sentimental connection with the Hmong as he came to understand the stories behind the weavings. Having experience in textiles, and recognizing that he had uncovered a rare gem in the industry, he set out to develop Ethnotek. Today Ethnotek purchases handmade textiles directly from the villages they are conceived in at the exact market rate that the village charges; these fabrics are then used as the interchangeable front panel of their packs. In partnering directly with artisans to create their backpacks, Ethnotek helps to preserve a traditional craft; they put money in the hands of workers who are otherwise suffering as a result of the rise of factory-produced goods. In turn, they are contributing to a sustainable global economy and preserving cultures and environments that we as backpackers seek to explore.With a focus on sustainable business, the company has taken a number of measures to ensure success and create a model that keeps needles threaded, looms moving, and dye baths full: They offer a variety of style threads for their bags to help ensure audience demand and continued production, and they do regular consumer testing, to see which fabrics are most popular amongst consumers. ""We thought long and hard about how to present the original idea of Ethnotek. It's no accident that we chose bags as the product to present the idea to the world. If you were to pair the idea with a product that no one wants to buy, or belongs to a niche market, then the likelihood of achieving sustainability or longevity of any kind decreases. That is why bags make sense, especially ones that can be updated and customized,"" expresses Orak.The interchangeable thread concept for the front panel of the bags offers consumers the ability to personalize their bag and obtain multiple looks without having to purchase multiple backpacks. This model also helps increase the likelihood of the consumer to purchase more fabric styles, further contributing to these communities. Current fabric thread styles are bought from Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Ghana and Guatemala and Ethnotek is looking to expand, planning to explore opportunities in South America as well as partner with the Native American community here in the United States. Furthering the cause, the Ethnotek team has also made it a focus to recycle their fabrics -- turning scraps into colorful bracelets -- as well as seek out recycled materials from other companies that can be used constructively in their products (e.g. incorporating shoe laces from nearby shoe factories into the production of their bag handles).Ethnotek has genuinely made strong efforts when developing their business model to be a truly sustainable company, unlike some other companies that make these claims, but realistically fall short. As consumers we must be more conscious of our purchasing habits, especially when making active efforts to support the global economy. However, be wary of many companies that claim they are sustainable. Do your own research to ensure you aren't just supporting another corporate wolf in sheep's clothing.""For more on Ethnotek or get your very own bag go to www.Ethnotekbags.com."
6,DIVORCE,"Dealing with Disasters & Aftermath Of Superstorm Sandy, Divorced or Not","Bari Zell Weinberger, Esq., Contributor
Family law expert and founder of Weinberger Divorce & Family L...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dealing-with-disasters-af_us_5b9c7d39e4b03a1dcc7f1fdb,"To see the heavy toll natural disasters can take on marriages, look no further than Hurricane Katrina",2012-11-12,"HIGHLANDS, NJ - NOVEMBER 01: An abandoned trailer home, with the words, 'Bye-bye Paradise, it was nice while it lasted,' spray painted on its side, is seen in the Paradise Park trailer Park on November 1, 2012 in Highlands, New Jersey. Superstorm Sandy, which has left millions without power or water, continues to affect business and daily life throughout much of the eastern seaboard. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c7d392200005600d941b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The physical aftermath of Superstorm Sandy has been nothing short of gut wrenching: lives lost and businesses destroyed; New Jersey's famous shoreline shredded; parts of Queens, NY obliterated by a threefold wrath of wind, water, and fire; gas rationing, impassable roads and thousands still without power. However, this is only what we see on the outside. On the inside, in the hearts and minds of couples affected by Sandy, a different kind of storm may be brewing. To see the heavy toll natural disasters can take on marriages, look no further than Hurricane Katrina. In the year following the 2005 storm, divorces spiked by 10 percent in New Orleans; in 2012, the divorce rate remains lifted. When couples share the story of their divorce, they often cite issues directly related to Katrina, including financial stress, as reasons why their marriage ended. Maybe we will hear happy stories of storm-inspired reunions in the next few months, of couples on the brink of divorce trapped together during Sandy who reunite and work through their differences. Let's hope so. But for those who had contemplated a divorce long before Sandy, or for couples who already separated, what so many of us have been living through could very well make the difference between a troubled marriage and an irretrievably broken one. What's the state of your union -- or disunion -- in the wake of Sandy? We recently posted some items for divorced families to consider in the aftermath of Sandy on our website, but there is much more. Here are additional tips for either married or divorced couples to help deal with disastrous situations: Work Together: If there is animosity in your relationship right now, try as much as possible to take a more business-like approach to your family's post-storm recovery efforts. For house clean up, create a to-do list at the start of the day and divide up jobs, paying attention that each spouse receives a relatively equal load of tasks to complete. If tensions are running high, don't work together as long as you can avoid it. For example, if your spouse is clearing brush, you can bring ruined items up from the basement. Putting in a hard day's work by getting everything on your to-do list done also comes with the silver lining of possibly making the two of you too tired to fight at the end of the day. Get Help: Some individuals may require crisis counseling to make it through this difficult time. However, when frustrations and squabbles lead to bullying, threats, or physical and sexual violence, reach out for emergency assistance. Do not postpone calling 911 in an emergency situation because you think the police are too busy. We call police officers heroes because of their bravery in the face of danger, but also because of their willingness to juggle multiple crisis situations at once. I cannot think of a single cop who would ever want a domestic assault victim to refrain from reaching out for help. Deal with Damaged Assets: For most couples, the family home is their most valuable asset. So what do you do if Sandy just destroyed it? The first course of action is to assess all damage yourself. Keep a written file and take photos and video to document storm-related problems. Check your insurance policies to see if you carry flood insurance and what kind of coverage your homeowners insurance provides, if any, for natural disasters. Be in touch with your insurance company and have an adjuster visit your property as soon as possible. If you live in one of the disaster areas now covered by FEMA, financial assistance may be available to you to pay for structural damage to your family home and property due to the storm. Visit http://www.disasterassistance.gov to start the application process. If you are in the midst of divorce now, it may be necessary to have your house reappraised to understand its true post-storm worth, especially if the value of your home will be calculated as part of your divorce settlement. Sadly, in some heavily affected communities such as Breezy Point, NY and Mantoloking, NJ, storm destruction will likely factor in future home values. Address Parenting Issues: For separated (or already divorced) parents who have a child custody agreement in place, the storm no doubt led to some disruptions. If you have access to it right now, look over your child custody agreement. Is there a clause addressing what happens to child custody during an emergency or natural disaster? If so, there is usually guidance on how to proceed in the future to recoup this time.If you do not have a specific clause in your agreement that addresses child custody changes in the event of an emergency, consider the possibility of make-up time to lessen the frustrations that have arisen from one parent's lost time last week. Once things have settled down, talk to your ex-spouse about arranging for extra time over the next couple of weekends to make up for this missed time. Not only will it create a better co-parenting relationship, but it will provide you time to cure some of the damage in and around the house without having to worry about child care. Pay Spousal and Child Support: If you are separated or divorced and a support order is in place, generally, unless there is a formal modification made in writing between you and your former spouse or an adjustment is issued by the courts, consider yourself obligated to pay your usual amount of child support or spousal support (alimony), regardless of whether you missed work this past week due to the storm. However, if your area has been declared a disaster area as a result of the storm, you may qualify for FEMA Unemployment Assistance (http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/lwdhome/press/2012/20121101_DisasterUIAssistance.html). Contact your local unemployment office or FEMA office for more information. Please note that FEMA will not directly pay child support, alimony, or mortgage payments.Other Helpful Sites and Information:- After Sandy: Seven Insurance Tips: http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=weather&id=8866874  - Post-Storm Home and Health Safety:  http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?a=4186&q=513152  - Volunteer Opportunities:  http://newyork.cbslocal.com/guide/where-to-donate-or-volunteer-to-sandy-relief-effort/ - Will FEMA replace a flooded vehicle?:  https://faq.fema.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/647/~/assistance-with-vehicle-repairs%2Freplacement  - Crisis Counseling:  http://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/advisories/1210311753.aspx  - National Domestic Abuse Hotline: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233)"

From stunning sandy beaches to holiday celebrations, some of the more idyllic scenarios have some harsh realities. If you're considering one of these fantasy-wedding ideas, take note of the realities you may face and how you should deal with them.Fantasy: What could be more romantic than a ceremony on the beach? The crashing waves, the breeze in your hair, the warm sun...it sounds like perfection.Reality: High winds, blowing sand, extreme heat and sand fleas are all things that my team and I have experienced at beach weddings.Solution: There isn't much you can do to change the environment on the beach. You have to prepare a good ""Plan B"" in case weather conditions aren't well suited for a ceremony on your wedding day. If you only need to protect your guests from high temperatures, purchase some pretty parasols to shield them from the sun and make sure they wear at least flip-flops to protect their feet from the scalding sand.Fantasy:  Outdoor wedding receptions look so beautiful in the movies. The natural setting of trees, lakes and blooming bushes makes a gorgeous backdrop.Reality: Expensive tents, flying insects, uneven ground, bad weather and unfortunately placed trees can get in the way of this fantasy setting.Solution: It's important to be aware of the extra expenses that go into hosting a successful garden wedding, particularly if you're having it at home or at a location that isn't geared toward having outdoor events. A good tent can be very expensive. I've had clients spend $7,000 for a basic one. Once you add flooring, air conditioning and décor, it can cost much, much more. If you're doing this at home, you will also incur the expense of renting tables, chairs and linens.Insects are a big issue for outdoor events. If you're doing it at home, you will need to arrange for some sort of pest control close to the wedding day. Otherwise, your guests will be overcome by mosquitoes and similar pests. Flying insects love sugary wedding cakes!Something as simple as a poorly placed tree can also derail your outdoor wedding. Tents need a certain amount of space to be raised. If there isn't enough clear perimeter space around the tent, you won't be able to use one.Bad weather can be an issue, too. You must have a good back-up plan whenever you plan to celebrate outdoors.Fantasy: You're a crafty bride who wants to show your skills and create a rustic-chic atmosphere for your wedding. You envision guests oohing and ahhing at your stunning creations, all done with your own two hands and maybe a little help from your friends.Reality: The months spent planning your wedding can be very busy. Time often grows short, and all of the projects you want to do take more time and money than you planned. Your approaching wedding day begins to feel more like an albatross than a joy.Solution: Pick your projects wisely. We love when couples add special touches to their weddings, but if you're having an elaborate event and you try to do everything, you may exhaust yourself. Hire professionals to do some of your less favorite (or more difficult) projects and keep the fun ones for yourself.Make sure you're realistic about what materials will cost you. DIY doesn't necessarily mean cheap. Plan ahead and start your projects well in advance of the wedding day. That way, if you get fewer helpers than you expect, you'll still have time to either complete the projects on your own or find an alternative.Fantasy: Holidays are a perfect time to have a wedding. Guests have time off from work, locations exhibit beautiful décor and everyone is in a festive mood.Reality: Guests have family obligations that may keep them from your wedding. Airfare, rental cars and hotels can be more expensive. Venues may have fewer staff working because holiday time usually means a slow-down for group business. Depending on the holiday, some items that you want may be more expensive.Solution: Talk to the family and friends that you absolutely want to attend your wedding and find out if having your wedding on a particular holiday will make it difficult for them to attend. Plan in advance so your traveling guests can find the best deals for their travel expenses. Discuss your service needs with your venue to make sure that they'll have appropriate, top-notch staff for your wedding day. Finally, make a realistic budget. If you want red roses for your wedding on Valentine's Day, for example, be prepared to pay a premium. Don't wait for the last minute to order, either, or the services and options you want may be unavailable!It's easy to get swept up in the idea of a fantasy wedding seen in a movie, magazine or online article, but keep in mind that every fantasy comes with a dose of reality. As long as you're prepared for potential pitfalls, you can achieve the wedding of your dreams!"
8,DIVORCE,Surely You Must Have Known,"Tracy Schorn, Contributor

That you knowingly turned a blind eye.,2012-11-12,Portrait of a unhappy young woman covering her ears over white background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c7dff3c0000660009c7f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Are your powers of premonition pretty lousy? Me too. I have no idea who is going to win elections or what the stock market is going to do next quarter.But when it comes to infidelity, you would've thought that everyone is clairvoyant and that particular super power skipped you. Because after you discover your spouse was cheating on you, there will be folks out there shaking their heads saying, ""surely you must have known.""One of the worst things about being cheated on is others' wrongheaded notion that somehow you were in on the deal. That you knowingly turned a blind eye. Perhaps you and your cheating spouse had an ""arrangement,"" wink, wink, nudge, nudge. The unspoken assumption is that you kind of deserve infidelity for being such an oblivious idiot.Of course, this is just a way for the smug to distance themselves from the pain and humiliation of betrayal. Just like some folks think cancer and other sorts of misfortune are contagious, it's easier to think we have control over Bad Things That Happen. It must be because you failed (unlike me). Blaming the victim is a nice little voodoo smug people do to protect themselves from the scary uncertainty that they too could be played.Perhaps you were smug once too, safe in the knowledge that infidelity would never happen to you.I know I was. I thought cheating is what happened when you had a sexless marriage, or let yourself go, or married some obvious Lothario. (The Lothario of my imagination being some cross between Austin Powers and a skeevy sales and marketing rep.)My husband loved me! My husband pursued me! My husband and I had sex! I was safe. Insomuch as I thought of infidelity at all, I thought it happened to other people. People with either really, sad pathetic marriages (see sexless and ugly above) or glamorous Bohemian people who were swept up in torrid affairs, helpless against the inevitability of their fated love. Solid, dull Midwesterners don't do drama, I thought. I was immune.We all see the world through our own moral lens. And if you have a particularly good set of morals (and assume everyone else does too), that makes you a good mark. If you've never experienced infidelity before and you know that you wouldn't cheat on your spouse, you stumble around the planet with a certain naivety. You wouldn't have done such a thing and therefore you can't imagine a world in which the person you are most intimate with daily would do such a thing either.That's why infidelity is so shattering. It completely up-ends your view of the world, your sense of reality, of whom you can trust. When it happened to me, it was like that scene in the Twilight Zone where the ""normal"" people suddenly rip off their masks and reveal that they are pig-snouted aliens. I was shocked to my core. The world has PIG-SNOUTED ALIENS?! WTF?! No one TOLD ME!Trusting your spouse is not pathological. It's what normal, loving people do. And that is why betrayal and manipulation are so very ugly. Because abusers take that trust -- that social glue that binds us together -- and they turn it on you. Use your loving ""benefit of the doubt"" against you.And as if that crap isn't painful enough, it's that much more painful to have the peanut gallery out there gawking and pointing and saying you were somehow party to your own abuse.You can only be in denial about something you know. Betrayed spouses beat themselves up for being chumps. The deception is humiliating. In retrospect the deceit looks so obvious (he never answered his cell phone, she was a sudden aficionado of Brazilian waxes...) And of course, you probably had gut feelings that things were off. But your cheater told you, no, everything was fine. Or no, actually you were the problem. And you believed that. Until you couldn't any more.After you know you've been cheated on, it's pretty normal to go through the stages of grief. Denial is one of those stages, as is bargaining. (Pig-snouted spouse... okay... maybe it's not that bad. Maybe I can work with this...) Once you know, however, that knowledge is a gift. It doesn't feel that way, of course. It feels like death. Like someone bulldozed your heart, and shoveled its remains into one of those radioactive waste containers, never to be touched again like Chernobyl. But really, knowledge is power. The worse part is not knowing.Surely you knew? No. You didn't. But now you do. The rest of your life is up to you. If you ask me? I think you should run as fast as you can from the pig-snouted aliens. Godspeed."

Australian lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected a bill Wednesday, Sept. 19, 2012, that would have legalized gay marriage, and similar legislation looked unlikely to pass despite public support for same-sex marriage. The House of Representatives voted 98-42 against the legislation, the first of four bills introduced to Parliament that aim to lift the country's ban on same-sex marriage. A separate bill was also being debated in the Senate on Wednesday.

New research suggests that marriage equality will boost the states' economies in a big way.The Williams Institute at UCLA Law reported Monday that wedding spending by same-sex couples in the three newest states to approve gay marriage may generate more than $166 million over the next three years.The Institute estimates that same-sex couples in Maine will collectively spend $15.5 million, Maryland couples will spend $62.6 million and Washingtonians will spend $88.5 million on weddings. The estimates are based on 2010 U.S. Census data and each state's average wedding spending. The researchers assumed that half of the states' same-sex couples (that's nearly 18,000 of about 35,000 gay couples in all three states combined) will marry within three years.Though same-sex marriage is already legal in Connecticut, Iowa, Washington, D.C., Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts, on Nov. 6 voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington were the first in the country to approve same-sex marriage by popular vote (in the other states, marriage equality was legalized by state legislation). Minnesota voters also rejected a ban on same-sex marriage.Economists have followed gay marriage's impact on the wedding industry and local economies since Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex unions in 2004. The Williams Institute found that from May 2004 to September 2008, the Massachusetts economy enjoyed a $111 million boost as a result of gay marriage legalization.And in July, CNN Money reported that the legalization of gay marriage in New York boosted New York City's economy by $259 million in just one year.“The same number of people have been getting married every year for the last 20 years,” Carley Roney, co-founder and editor in chief of TheKnot.com, told The Daily Beast. “Gay marriage is literally the only thing that has the potential to change the size of the wedding industry.”For gay-friendly wedding vendors and venues in Maryland and Maine, check out the slideshow below.Keep in touch!

A 41-year-old British banker reportedly filed for divorce from her husband after he refused to play out sex scenes from the novel in their marital bedroom, The Sun reported. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" includes S&M, bondage and other kinky sexual activities.

Collins)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c81c92000003100fd98e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We all know that Facebook is eating up our free time. But new research suggests that the social network may be making us fat and poor. Facebook increases our self-esteem, which negatively impacts our decision-making skills and judgement, according to Andrew Stephen, associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, and Keith Wilcox, associate professor at Columbia University. In turn, Facebook lowers our self-control and encourages negative behaviors like overspending and overeating.The researchers found that more time spent on Facebook means higher credit card debt. Just five minutes of Facebook usage a day was proven to lower a user’s self-control, according to the study, which was based on an Internet survey of 541 American Facebook users. Facebook surpassed 1 billion users worldwide in early October and is expected to see that figure double by 2014, according to some estimates. The average American spends eight hours a month on Facebook mostly due to boredom, according to a recent study. In America, 71.2 percent of Internet users are on Facebook, according to the social network. Despite Stephen and Wilcox’s findings, the relationship between social networks and self-esteem is hotly contested. According to research published by Computers in Human Behavior, the 526 million people who log on to Facebook every day experience a self-esteem boost by using their profiles to construct how others see them. However, another study by a Ph.D. student in Stanford’s psychology department found that Facebook leads users to feel dejected and worthless when comparing their lives to those of their friends online. Regardless of how Facebook makes users feel, Stephen and Wilcox’s study confirms previous research that has found that lower credit scores and credit card debt are strongly associated with poor self-control. In a 2001 survey, 40 percent of credit card holders blamed self-control problems on the widespread availability of credit cards, which increase our ability to overspend. Nearly half of all Americans do not know what their credit score is, according to a survey of 2,200 people from CouponCabin.com. In September, the average American household had about $6,700 in credit card debt with U.S. credit card debt in 2011 totaling $46.7 billion. "

David Petraeus' resignation and admission of an extramarital affair Friday caught plenty of people off guard, but for many of us, the story sounded all too familiar. From FDR's long-hidden affair with a younger woman to Bill Clinton's infamous admission of infidelity with a White House intern and countless others in between, how many times have we seen this narrative play out before? It was the ""heard it before"" element of the Petraeus story that led HuffPost columnist Lisa Belkin to wonder, ""What is it about powerful men and sex?"" Why do relatively few powerful women get caught up in sex scandals? In a HuffPost blog, she wrote: Is sex so fundamentally different for each gender that men see it as exerting their influence, while women somehow succumb to it? Have we simply not reached the point where there are enough women in positions of power, a critical mass that will make cheating an equal opportunity perk of office -- men do this because they can, and women don't because they can't... yet? Or are women just more moral than men?With Belkin's blog post in mind, we asked our followers on Facebook and Twitter why they thought powerful men seem to cheat more than powerful women.
