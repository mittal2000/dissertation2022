0,POLITICS,Refugee Crisis Fuels European Fears On Terrorism,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/refugee-crisis-new-poll_us_5784e754e4b0ed2111d77c7b,A Pew Research Center study shows negative views extend beyond security considerations to economic concerns.,2016-07-12,The Pew Research Center study finds many Europeans believe refugees are linked to terrorism and that only a minority of those surveyed believe diversity makes their country a better place to live.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5784e80c1a00002700dd0d7f.jpeg?ops=crop_9_5_2471_1384%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The resurgence of nationalist sentiment that catalyzed Britain’s EU referendum is prevalent in other European nations, Pew research released on Monday shows. It’s linked overwhelmingly to fears of increasing refugee populations, terrorism and resistance to cultural diversity, according to the survey of people in 10 different European countries.Pew found that majorities in eight nations researchers questioned believed refugees increased the likelihood of terrorism in their country. This sentiment echoes those expressed in the wake of the attacks on Paris in November and Brussels in March, at a time when there had been a surge in arrivals of migrants and refugees across European Union-member countries.“The criticism of the way the EU has handled the refugee crisis has penetrated all the way to Sweden,” said Bruce Stokes, director of global economic attitudes at Pew. “That shows how deeply upset people across Europe are with the handling of this issue.”The negative perceptions extend beyond security considerations to economic concerns ― 50 percent or more of respondents in half of the nations polled believe refugees will take away jobs and social benefits. When it comes to crime, the link to refugees is far less salient. However, almost half of respondents in Italy and Sweden believe that “refugees are more to blame for crime than other groups.” Meanwhile, well over half of Europeans in Hungary (72 percent), Italy (69 percent), Poland (66 percent), and Greece (65 percent) have unfavorable views of Muslims living in their country. In every country polled, the dominant view is that Muslims want to be distinct from larger society, rather than to adapt to European customs. However, Europeans seem split when it comes to explicitly associating these groups with the Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS. Fewer than half of respondents in every country polled agreed with the statement that “Muslims in our country support extremist groups like the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS.” But in half of the countries polled, a quarter or more of respondents believed that many or most Muslims do support the extremist group.  These findings highlight an ideological divide in Europe. People with a conservative viewpoint in 9 of the 10 countries surveyed had a more unfavorable view toward Muslims. The disparity between people with right- and left-wing views in Greece and Germany, for instance, spans 30 or more points.This ideological divide also translates to perceptions of a diverse society. Only a minority of European respondents in all nations surveyed believed diversity made their country a better place to live.Those who hold conservative views are significantly more likely than those with more liberal views to say that growing diversity makes their country “a worse place to live”. When broken down by nationality, over half of Greeks and Italians and about 4 in 10 Hungarians and Poles said growing diversity is detrimental. Europeans’ views on diversity are in contrast to those Americans held in a Pew study released in March. Over half of Americans said having “more people of many different races, ethnic groups, and nationalities” makes the U.S. a better place to live, according to the survey. Only 7 percent of Americans said a diverse society makes life worse. The Pew Research Center study was conducted from April 4 to May 12 among 11,494 people in Europe and the United States. The margin of error ranged from 3.1 to 4.6 percent."

The bill would now go before parliament.“The decision is necessary because the Republic would like to prevent this house from becoming a ‘cult site’ for neo-Nazis in any way, which it has been repeatedly in the past, when people gathered there to shout slogans,” Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka told reporters before the cabinet meeting.“It is my vision to tear down the house,” he added. A commission consisting of 12 members from the fields of politics, administration, academia and civic society will ultimately decide the fate of the building.A retired local woman owns the property, which Austria’s interior ministry has been renting since 1972 and has sublet to Braunau. The ministry pays around 4,800 euros ($5,332) a month in rent.The building has housed workshops for disabled people, but has been empty since 2011, because the owner repeatedly rejected ideas for the future use of the house and purchase offers from the state, according to the interior ministry spokesman.Once the law has passed parliament, the owner has no right to appeal the decision or negotiate her compensation, which will be in line with the sum paid to home owners evicted in the course of railway line construction, he said.Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938. Debate still smolders over whether Austrians were willing accomplices, many having cheered his return to his country of birth at the time, or the first victims of a dictatorship that ultimately reduced much of Europe to ruins and cost tens of millions of lives."

Morgan Chase, says the bank's pay increase for its lowest paid employees is the right thing to do in an era when pay has not risen for most people.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578517721a00002700dd0e59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"JPMorgan Chase will give its lowest paid employees a raise over the next two years, its chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon wrote in an opinion piece for The New York Times on Tuesday.The bank currently has a minimum wage of $10.15 an hour plus benefits. Over the next two years, it will raise base pay to between $12 and $16.50 an hour “depending on geographic and market factors,” Dimon writes. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, a rate that has not risen since 2009. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have minimum wages above the federal rate. JPMorgan Chase’s move is the right thing for the company to do in an era when pay has not risen for most people, Dimon said.“Wages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long,” he wrote.Dimon’s pay package was $27 million for 2015, a 35 percent rise from 2014.His column draws attention to the lower-paid Americans who work in the financial sector. A third of the 1.7 million workers in retail banking make less than $15 an hour, according to a 2015 study flagged in the Financial Times. And a third of bank tellers make so little that they receive some form of public aid, a 2013 study found. The move puts Dimon and JPMorgan Chase in basic agreement with the “Fight For $15” movement, which has advocated for a $15 an hour minimum wage. Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle have passed laws that will raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour over time. J.P. Morgan said in a release that its minimum wage in New York City and San Francisco will be $16.50 an hour in 2019. Workers in Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington, D.C., will make $15 in 2019.Of the 18,000 workers at the company who will receive a pay boost, Dimon said many were customer service representative and bank tellers. J.P. Morgan Chase announced last May that it would cut 5,000 employees in the next year. Dimon said at the time that the average JPMorgan Chase branch would lose two bank tellers, The Wall Street Journal reported. The job losses come as the bank increases automation and electronic banking. “It’s cheaper for us and good for clients,” he said, according to the WSJ. This story has been updated with city-specific salary information from a JPMorgan press release."

The shooting happened while bailiffs were removing the inmate from a holding cell for an unspecified court appearance at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph. The inmate wrested a gun from one of the officers and began shooting, Bailey said.Joe Zangaro, 61, head of courthouse security, and Ron Kienzle, 63, who had been with the court since 2005, were both slain, ABC7 reported.“Our hearts are torn apart,” Bailey said at a news conference Monday evening. “They were my friends, they were my colleagues.”The suspect opened fire around 2:30 p.m., according to TV station WZZM. The shooting started on the third floor of the courthouse, sending people inside the building scrambling for shelter.“Brave officers were able to come to their rescue and take the shooter down,” Bailey said.The sheriff said a civilian was shot in the arm in a hallway outside the holding area.Gov. Rick Snyder tweeted earlier Monday that Michigan State Police were involved in the investigation, and he asked for people to “please join me in praying for those affected.”St. Joseph is a small lakefront city roughly 100 miles east of Chicago.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Gordon was from Coloma, Minnesota. He was from Coloma, Michigan."

What it will do is change the dynamics of the convention,” said Dane Waters, head of Delegates Unbound, a group that’s trying to deny Trump the GOP presidential nomination at next week’s Republican National Convention.Nearly two dozen other states have similar laws requiring delegates to vote a certain way. Payne’s decision throws the validity of all of them into doubt.“It is a repudiation of Trump’s efforts to stifle the ability of delegates to vote their conscience,” Waters said.Trump’s supporters had opposed Correll at a hearing Payne held last week in Richmond ― proof, Waters said, that the Trump campaign understands that delegates will dump Trump if it’s allowed.The Trump campaign did not respond to The Huffington Post’s questions about the ruling. But campaign staffers have been contacting delegates to make sure they will honor Republican National Committee rules that require them to vote according to the results of primaries and caucuses in their states.One top RNC official familiar with the discussion over these rules said Monday’s decision gives Trump’s opponents some favorable publicity, but doesn’t alter the underlying numbers. “The PR value of the opinion is greater than the legal effect,” the official told HuffPost on condition of anonymity to describe internal matters. “The RNC rules are still the rules.”Members of Delegates Unbound and Free the Delegates are working to modify the convention rules to let the 2,472 convention delegates vote without regard to how their states and congressional districts voted.But many of the RNC members assembling for a week of committee meetings said the anti-Trump activists simply do not have the votes they need. “It’s going nowhere,” said Peter Feaman, an RNC member from Florida.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The HillaryBots just hate the BernieBros, and the feeling is so, so mutual.Yeah, whatevz. Take a look at this video from the official Democratic Party platform meeting in Orlando, Florida. They’re “debating” antitrust language, establishing the party’s official stance on heavy concentrations of corporate power. Behold the great conflict of our times, the rending of a once-great political institution as it … unanimously agrees about something. Watch different factions of the Democratic Party hug each other over a shared commitment to curbing corporate power in the video below:Some variety of antitrust language appeared in the Democratic Party platform from the days of President Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century until the failed presidential bid of Michael Dukakis in 1988. It vanished in 1992 during the nomination of Bill Clinton, who ran on a corporate-friendly platform.So when Sen. Bernie Sanders’ delegates try to resurrect some kind of pro-antitrust stance in the very year that Bill Clinton’s wife is set to take the party’s presidential nomination, surely this affront will wreak intraparty havoc.That, or a total lovefest.Sanders delegate Mary Bottari, a longtime progressive activist from Madison, Wisconsin, found common cause with former Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.). Pryor was not exactly viewed as a left-wing hero during his days in the upper chamber. He opposed same-sex marriage and was occasionally referred to as “the senator from Walmart” before losing his re-election bid in 2014.But Pryor and Bottari worked out mutually acceptable language aimed at taking down corporate power before delegates formally met to debate the issue. Bottari had pushed for a stronger stance, informed by the work of Barry Lynn, who runs the antitrust wing of the nonpartisan New America Foundation. Pryor, a Clinton delegate, wanted a more moderate tone.They decided on this:We support the historic purpose of the antitrust laws to protect competition, and against the sort of excessively consolidated economic and political power which can be corrosive to a healthy democracy. We support reinvigorating DOJ and FTC enforcement of antitrust laws to prevent abusive behavior by dominant companies, and protecting the public interest against abusive, discriminatory, and unfair methods of commerce. We support President Obama’s recent Executive Order, directing all agencies to identify specific actions they can take in their areas of jurisdiction to detect anticompetitive practices ― such as tying arrangements, price fixing, and exclusionary conduct ― and refer practices that appear to violate federal antitrust law to the DOJ and FTC.Note the reference to “reinvigorating” enforcement, which suggests that Obama’s antitrust regulation has been weak, alongside the praise for his recent executive order, which suggests that even the president wants to do better. This is the language of reconciliation. It acknowledges shortcomings without foreclosing the possibility that people of good will can do better together. When Pryor took the mic after unanimous approval of the amendment, he addressed both Bottari and the broader audience in Orlando.“Let me just say one quick word, if I may, to the Bernie Sanders supporters here,” Pryor said. “Let me just say I’m a lifelong Democrat, and I am glad to have you here. We’re glad to have you in the party. You’ve made a big difference in 2016. Thank you for being here today, thank you for participating and thank you for the unity.”Man. These two teams just don’t like each other."

She’s lived through Politico’s transformation from scrappy website and Hill-centric newspaper to a politics and policy powerhouse boasting over 250 staffers in Washington, along with outposts in New York and Europe.After covering the 2008 campaign, Budoff Brown jumped to the White House beat through 2014. She headed to Brussels to join Politico Europe, which launched in spring 2015, initially as associate editor and senior policy reporter, but was soon promoted to managing editor.The Huffington Post reported last month that Harris was hoping to choose Politico’s next editor before the political conventions, which begin Monday in Cleveland, and that Budoff Brown was one of the company’s top internal candidates.There were doubts among Politico staffers that Budoff Brown would return to the states so soon after moving to Europe ― even if offered such a prestigious post. But buzz inside Politico’s Rosslyn newsroom over the past week signaled Budoff Brown was the leading contender. The New York Times reported Monday she was getting the job just before the company’s top brass kicked off a newsroom meeting to officially announce it. In Monday’s memo, Harris wrote that Glasser would still remain in charge of Politico’s coverage through the presidential election before becoming a foreign affairs columnist. The promotion of Budoff Brown, who has deep experience throughout the Politico newsroom and is well-liked among colleagues, should make for a painless transition at a company that’s been rocked by change this year. Just days before the Iowa caucuses, Politico announced co-founder and CEO Jim VandeHei, Playbook writer Mike Allen, and Glasser would all be leaving after the election, along with other executives departing even sooner. VandeHei and Allen have said they are starting a new company, while Glasser plans to move to Israel, where her her husband, New York Times reporter Peter Baker, is headed as the paper’s next Jerusalem bureau chief.VandeHei ended up leaving the company in April, several months ahead of schedule. While Allen will remain through the election, the company recently handed the reins of Playbook to Politico reporters Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman, who kicked off the next incarnation of the influential tipsheet just hours Politico’s before new editor was revealed.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) won’t help to advance President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. He’s been pretty blunt about wanting Donald Trump to be the next president, and about letting him appoint someone more conservative to the court.“Trust me. We will not allow the Supreme Court to flip,” Johnson said in March.But before the Supreme Court seat opened up this year, the senator considered filling federal vacancies to be more urgent. In June 2015, when the Senate was debating the National Defense Authorization Act, Johnson offered an amendment underscoring that Obama should have to fill federal posts within 210 days of a vacancy opening up.Here’s the key passage in his amendment:It is the sense of the Senate that― (1) the President should comply with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 and fill vacancies of Presidentially-appointed positions, including Inspectors General, within 210 days of the position becoming vacant;Obama nominated Merrick Garland in March to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. That means, by Johnson’s metric, the Senate should be voting to fill the seat before Sept. 10. But Republicans have given no indication they’ll give Garland a hearing, never mind a vote, which would mean the Supreme Court seat staying empty for hundreds of days.A Johnson spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on how the senator squares his efforts to leave the Supreme Court seat empty with his previous push to fill federal vacancies more quickly. Speaking of judges: The Wisconsin senator is also behind the longest circuit court vacancy in the country.Johnson is up for re-election in November. His Democratic challenger, former Sen. Russ Feingold, is currently leading by 11 percentage points, according to HuffPollster. "

Multiple media outlets identified the commenter as Rodney Lee Wilson, but a department spokesperson declined to confirm the officer’s identity to The Huffington Post. (Both the Facebook accounts in question are no longer publicly accessible.) The officer was fired, “effective immediately,” Donchez said, and a criminal investigation is underway.“I want to assure our community, and those outside our community, that our highest priority is the safety and welfare of the citizens of Overland Park, and the men and women who protect everyone,” he said. “I will continue to hold the employees of the Overland Park Police Department accountable for its actions on and off-duty.”Williams told Kansas City NBC affiliate KSHB that she “felt horrified” by the officer’s comment, particularly because she’d never even met him. She said she was worried that he might retaliate if he was fired for his actions.The threatening comment was posted hours after a man assaulted and killed five police officers during a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas.

18,POLITICS,Trump's Big New Idea For A Veterans Hotline Was Tried Already... By Trump,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-veterans-hotline_us_5783f248e4b01edea78f08c9,It didn't go swimmingly.,2016-07-11,"Donald Trump wants a veterans hotline.

Trump debuted a variation of the hotline idea during the Republican primary. It didn’t perform to expectations. In July 2015, the Trump campaign established a phone number and email address for “veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration.”“If he is elected President he will take care of these and all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently like a world-class business man can do, but a politician has no clue,” his campaign said in an accompanying Facebook post.The hotline, in short, was a less ambitious version of what Trump is now proposing: a place for people to share stories, but not necessarily facilitate better health care. But even with those limited ambitions, it sputtered. When reporters began trying the hotline, they got an automated message telling them to send an email instead. “[I]t appears that the hotline is no longer accepting calls,” reported The Blaze in February. IJ Review had a veteran call the hotline, only to see the call go “directly to voicemail following a quick reference to the Trump campaign.”And it appears the hotline hasn’t gotten any better since. The Huffington Post dialed 855-VETS-352 a few times, only to hit the same frustrating wall. We were told to email veterans@donaldtrump.com and were offered the option to press 1 to get back to the main menu. When we did, we got the same exact automated message. We pressed 1 again and the line dropped. So we tried the same exact steps, only this time, we didn’t press 1 on the second go-around. A voice came on the line. “Thank you for calling,” it said, “goodbye.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
19,POLITICS,Flint Fallout Prompts Philadelphia To Do Extra Tests For Lead In Water,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/philadelphia-lead-water_us_577e9314e4b0c590f7e85f20,The new round of testing appears to be a response to activist pressure.,2016-07-11,"Philadelphia will host the 2016 Democratic National Convention in July. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive nominee, made the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, part of her presidential campaign.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577e9e121a000023006f9057.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Philadelphia announced Friday that it will conduct new tests for lead in the city’s water, apparently in response to activists’ cries that the city wasn’t doing enough to assure residents their taps are safe.The city’s water department said it will collect samples this summer from at least 50 homes classified as having the highest water lead risks. Previously, the city had not planned to do any lead testing this year. Like many big water systems with a history of meeting federal standards, Philadelphia only has to look for lead every three years.Though the department said it’s making the changes because it received updated guidance from the state, the announcement seems designed to ease activist pressure.This summer, for instance, a small band of Philadelphians calling themselves the Philly Unleaded Project plan to independently verify the city’s assurances.“It came to our attention because of all the stuff that was happening in Flint,” Philly Unleaded’s Tony Spagnoli told HuffPost. “That was a really big wake-up call.”Spagnoli, a 33-year-old urban planner, said he welcomes the city’s water department’s newly announced testing regimen, but he’s not going to call off his independent testing effort. He said he and his team of volunteers hope to get some 400 Philadelphia residents to fill liter bottles from their kitchen sinks this summer. Then they’ll send the samples to Virginia Tech’s lab for analysis by civil engineer Marc Edwards.Why Edwards? Because last summer, Edwards oversaw a similar independent sampling effort in Flint, Michigan, leading him to warn residents not to drink the water because it was tainted with lead, a brain-damaging metal used for water pipes in many American cities. The Michigan government pooh-poohed Edwards’ warnings, but subsequent testing of Flint kids’ blood proved him right: There was lead in the water. Edwards is not directing the sampling effort in Philadelphia. And just because the activists want to test the water doesn’t mean it’s unsafe ― just that the city hasn’t done enough to assure them it isn’t. Flint’s water became brown and funky after the state changed the city’s water source, something very unusual for a water system to do. It was obvious to Flint residents that their water was weird, but the real problem was lead, which is colorless and tasteless. The only way to detect lead in water is by sending the water to a lab. Federal regulations require big cities to test for lead in water samples from people’s homes. At least half of those homes are supposed to be connected to water mains via lead service lines, so the sampling pool can give a picture of how bad the lead contamination might be in water from the riskiest possible faucets. But despite an abundance of such homes in the Philadelphia, fewer than half of the city’s 134 samples taken in 2014 came from high-risk addresses. The city’s sampling that year showed 90 percent of homes had less than 5 parts per billion of lead in their water, well below the 15 parts per billion threshold set by the Environmental Protection Agency. What Spagnoli wants to know is, what would the numbers be if the city sampled at more sites with lead pipes? Now, the city plans to find out the answer.Avoiding the highest-risk homes is a tactic that actually resulted in criminal charges in Flint. In May, the Michigan attorney general charged two former state officials with several crimes, including a misdemeanor because they failed “to collect required samples included in the Tier 1 category of serviced lines.”Both the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the federal Environmental Protection Agency had given their blessing to Philadelphia’s testing procedures, but in June some Philadelphia residents filed a class-action lawsuit. Among other things, the suit alleges that the city’s sampling methods are “diluting its testing pool and skewing the results in such a way as to paint a woefully inaccurate picture of the City’s overall lead contamination.” The case also complains that the city’s instructions for taking samples aren’t ideal for catching the most lead. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees city water systems throughout the state, recently cited two other Pennsylvania towns for failing to collect samples from the riskiest homes. HuffPost asked the agency why Warwick Township and Lititz Borough received citations for avoiding lead pipe samples, but Philadelphia hasn’t. “There is no one-size-fits all approach to resolving violations, and enforcement actions are taken according to the nature and severity of the violation,” spokesman Neil Shader said in an email, noting the agency doesn’t comment on possible future enforcement actions.Activists applauded Philadelphia’s announcement about the new testing.“This change is very welcome, and also we must keep in mind it is the result of painstaking work by ordinary people who have taken it upon themselves to do oversight,” said Yanna Lambrinidou, a water expert and affiliate faculty member at Virginia Tech. Lambrinidou is part of a group of activists and experts that has been pushing the EPA to crack down on Philadelphia. (Lambrinidou said she’s given informal advice to Philly Unleaded, though she and Edwards aren’t overseeing Spagnoli’s testing drive.)If Philadelphia was not complying with the Safe Drinking Water Act, it wouldn’t make the city that unusual ― the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit, reported last week that more than 5,000 community water systems broke the rules last year, and only 5.7 percent were officially sanctioned by state or federal regulators. Even Flint’s water got a pass under the regulation, at least until the EPA issued an emergency order in January, almost a year after serious problems came to light. The city of Philadelphia has insisted all year that its water is safe to drink because it meets federal standards. In a statement Friday, Water Commissioner Debra McCarty said the agency “strives to go above and beyond for its customers every day.”But Gary Burlingame, the director of laboratory services for the Philadelphia Water Department, told HuffPost in April that the Flint crisis may have been a bit overblown, and that it’s not clear that drinking water can pose a serious risk of lead exposure.“What we don’t have from Flint is a peer-reviewed published study to look at the science of Flint,” Burlingame said then. “All we have is what the news media’s reporting and some of the policy and management issues.”The blood lead research that forced the government to admit Flint’s water was dangerous actually had been peer-reviewed at the time of Burlingame’s statement. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention essentially confirmed those findings in a new paper.“Published peer-reviewed papers help put the pieces together, so the nation can understand and apply that understanding,” Burlingame said in an emailed statement for this story. “This paper provides an important step in that understanding. We will carefully study this paper ― and others that we expect have yet to be published ― involving the science behind Flint’s unfortunate events.”"

Photographed in Miami in 2009.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Dallas Police Department revealed new details Monday about a robot that was used to kill the suspect in a shooting rampage last week. Police tweeted that the robot was a Remotec Andros Mark V-A1 and not a Model F-5, as previously reported.The robot was used to dispatch a suspect who opened fire during a Black Lives Matter protest, killing five officers and injuring several more. The unit is supposed to be used for bomb disposal, though it was harnessed by police last week to deliver an explosive instead. While the decision kept officers out of harm’s way, some wondered about the implications of police deploying high-tech weapons without oversight. The Andros Mark V-A1, which is made by military tech company Northrop Grumman, contains a surveillance camera and an extendable arm with a rotatable “gripper.” It’s controlled wirelessly and can climb up stairs. In this case, it used its gripper to deliver a C4 explosive, which police detonated to kill the suspect.A non-lethal option may not have been possible, said Dr. Robert Latiff, a retired major general of the United States Air Force who now serves as a technology expert at the University of Notre Dame.“Given lots of time ― which they did not have ― and resources, the police probably could have disabled the shooter,” Latiff told The Huffington Post via email.“Remember though, they were in the midst of what would have been a combat situation. While the action they took was admittedly different, and will generate much discussion, I do not see it any differently than if a police marksman had been able to shoot the perpetrator from a distance,” he added.In a sense, the Mark V-A1 is a tool like any other. It isn’t some artificially intelligent kill bot like the Terminator. But Illah Nourbakhsh, a professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, warns that ignoring the greater implications of this technology’s deployment could be disastrous.“Future such robots will have only more bells and whistles, all of which provide the affordance for a whole array of ways in which the robot can perform activities never dreamt of by the engineers, or by the purchasing agents who chose to equip the police department with them,” Nourbakhsh told HuffPost via email. “This takes us to a Wild West where sophisticated machines unleash the creative potential of the users.”There are ethical concerns, he added.“There are no laws, guidelines or oversight processes for killing with a bomb disposal ‘bot,” Nourbakhsh said.The robot was used by Dallas police in a different way than intended. As robots become more advanced, Nourbakhsh argued, the gap between that original design and actual function will widen, which could lead to problems. We see this everywhere in developing technology.Consider your smartphone: When you bought it, even just a couple of years ago, there may not have been an easy way to keep law enforcement from prying into your messages if you became a criminal suspect. Now secure messaging apps are everywhere, potentially transforming your phone into a device with significantly more advanced capabilities than what you paid for.Apply that logic to heavy machinery that can be outfitted with weapons and you might understand what all of the concern is about."
24,SPORTS,Tim Duncan Retires From The NBA After 19 Seasons,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tim-duncan-retirement_us_577bcce7e4b09b4c43c117a2,And he did so in a very Duncan-esque way.,2016-07-11,"The San Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 4, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577bd0121800002500fa3eab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tim Duncan, arguably the best power forward to ever play the game of basketball, decided to retire on Monday after 19 seasons in the league.Duncan announced his retirement in a statement released through the San Antonio Spurs organization. In classic team-first, it’s-not-about-me Duncan style, no quotes from him were featured in the Spurs’ retirement press release. Over the course of his career, Duncan put together a résumé that few have ever matched: five NBA championships, three NBA Finals MVPs, two regular season MVPs, 15 All-Star Game selections, 10 All-NBA First Team selections, one team.But more so, he was known for the modesty, humility and consistency with which he played the game. Nicknamed “The Big Fundamental,” Duncan was never flashy and rarely expressive on the court. While other great players of his generation were known for turnaround fadeaways and ferocious dunks, Duncan’s signature shot was a vanilla bank shot from mid-range, which he punished defenders with over and over again during his two-decade career. Duncan never let the opposition get to him, going about his game in the same methodical manner no matter the opponent. And they knew it, too. “The Spurs won because of Tim Duncan, a guy I could never break,” Shaquille O’Neal once said. “I could talk trash to Patrick Ewing, get in David Robinson’s face, get a rise out of Alonzo Mourning, but when I went at Tim he’d look at me like he was bored.”Off the court, Duncan was understated and unselfish. When told after his team won the 2003 NBA Finals that he had registered 21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists and eight blocks in its final game, Duncan simply replied, “That’s cool.” When teammate Tony Parker won the NBA Finals MVP in 2007, no one appeared happier for him than Duncan. The Spurs organization knew what it had almost from the beginning. “The chances of us trading Tim Duncan are about the same as (then-scout) R.C. Buford starting at off guard,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said after the team drafted Duncan No. 1 in the 1997 NBA Draft. As such, the team built around Duncan from the outset, surrounding the Virgin-Islands-born player with teammates that matched him both in skill and personality.Soon, Duncan would become Rookie of the Year. “Do I give a speech or something?” he joked. Just two years later, he would hoist the team’s first championship trophy and his own first NBA Finals MVP. The Spurs never missed the playoffs during Duncan’s 19-year career, and Duncan’s statistics remained remarkably consistent through his first 18 seasons, each of those seasons scoring between 17.1 and 22.6 points per 36 minutes and pulling down between 10.5 and 12.2 rebounds.Perhaps even more impressively, they have become known over Duncan’s career as the premiere organization in the league ― as well as its most international. Few could argue with the idea that Duncan, one of the greatest and most selfless players ever, is the main reason why."
25,MEDIA,News Outlets Prepare For Possible Unrest At Political Conventions,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/political-convention-protests_us_5783ef18e4b0344d51506b5f,A top security firm has trained journalists at nearly two dozen organizations in recent months.,2016-07-11,"News organizations are preparing for possible danger at next week's Republican convention in Cleveland as major protests, like this one in Baton Rouge, take place throughout the country.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5783f0be1a00002600dd0b75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Ferguson. Baltimore. Cleveland?Over the past two years, journalists have been thrust into dangerous reporting situations as militarized police forces have squared off with protesters, evoking scenes more reminiscent of war zones than American cities. The shooting of five police officers Thursday during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Dallas, followed by the disproportionately aggressive police response toward protesters and journalists over the weekend in Baton Rouge, has only heightened safety concerns for the press heading into next week’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thousands of protesters and Trump supporters, including a group of white nationalists, are expected to converge on the city. Cleveland will assign about a third of its 1,700-person police force to the convention, while thousands of out-of-town officers will likely be added as reinforcements. The four-day Republican gathering wraps up Thursday, with the Democratic National Convention beginning four days later in Philadelphia. News organizations’ safety concerns for this two-week stretch have kept veteran journalist and security expert Frank Smyth very busy. Smyth, the founder and executive director of Global Journalist Security, said his group has conducted nearly two-dozen civil unrest trainings for news organizations in recent months. They’ve held these four-hour trainings in New York, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and Cleveland, he said. Global Journalist Security offers a two-day, $1,195 course on civil unrest and active shooter situations, the most recent taking place last week in Washington, D.C. Smyth’s group also held a four-hour, interactive online course pegged to the conventions on Monday for $495, and has scheduled another for Friday. His team has already scoped out Cleveland for potential flash points, he said, and they plan to offer additional trainings depending on demand.Smyth does not comment on his clients, though a Washington Post spokeswoman confirmed that some of the paper’s staff were doing training sessions with Global Journalist Security.The spokeswoman declined to comment further, and news organizations are broadly reluctant to discuss security protocols. While other outlets are surely taking precautions ahead of Cleveland, most of the more than 12 approached by The Huffington Post offered little about what, specifically, that entails.A New York Times spokeswoman said the paper has “resources and procedures in place for NYT staff covering any situation including the upcoming conventions that can present safety challenges.”“Given recent events it would be irresponsible not to train journalists to be acutely aware of their situations to be prepared for unexpected developments,” Mike Oreskes, NPR’s editorial director and senior vice president of news, told HuffPost in an email Monday. “We have a safety advisor who has met with staff and talked about how to best handle volatile situations,” Oreskes continued. “It’s always better to think ahead and plan. We have provided NPR staff and Member station reporters tips and guidelines that are lessons from people who have covered events ranging from Ferguson to Tahrir Square. It boils down to having situational awareness at all times and giving our journalists both here and abroad the tools so they can do their work and stay safe.”“We’re providing our staff with resources and support as we head into the conventions,” said Huffington Post Senior Politics Editor Sam Stein.Representatives from ABC News, NBC News, the Associated Press, and BuzzFeed declined to comment. Representatives from CBS News, Fox News, CNN, Reuters and Bloomberg did not immediately respond with comment.Smyth, who has reported from conflict zones around the world and spent more than a decade at the Committee to Protect Journalists, where he remains a senior adviser for journalist security, brings an extensive résumé to training journalists and others working in hazardous situations. His group began offering five-day courses in 2014 that tackled extreme issues like tactical casualty care and handling captivity if kidnapped. The clientele for these courses are mostly NGO and aid workers, he said, along with foreign correspondents. But Smyth said the interest in covering domestic unrest grew in response to the August 2014 demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri, that followed the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer. Journalists got swept up in the chaos, with at least two dozen arrested, including a HuffPost reporter. “Journalists who covered Ferguson said Ferguson was the most frightening thing they ever covered ― and some of these people had substantial overseas experience,” Smyth said. He noted how “things would change spontaneously on the ground” in Ferguson and there was a “real sense of panic and fear.” Next, he said, “Baltimore was another situation where it was highly dangerous,” a reference to April 2015 protests following the death of Freddie Gray in police custody. Smyth’s group began offering the two-day civil unrest class earlier this year. They recently tweaked that course to focus on the summer’s political conventions, events that could draw upwards of 15,000 journalists. Though political conventions have been the sight of civil unrest in the past, most notably during the 1968 Democratic convention, journalists have heightened concerns this election season given outbreaks of violence at Donald Trump rallies. The presumptive Republican nominee has also routinely attacked the “disgusting” reporters covering his raucous events, often to the cheers of his supporters. Beyond verbal attacks, a Secret Service agent roughed up a Time Magazine photographer in February as he tried covering a protest inside one of Trump’s rallies. The Washington Post reported the following month that NPR had sent its political reporters to a 90-minute hostile-environment awareness training, which the paper dubbed “Trump Training.” The possibility of Trump’s diehard fans turning on the press has come up in Global Journalist Security simulations. “Trump’s supporters have been primed to be aggressive,” Paul Burton, a former British commando and current training director for Global Journalist Security, told attendees at a convention-themed training in May, according to The New Yorker’s Nicholas Schmidle. “We’ve got a feeling something may happen, especially if Trump doesn’t get what he wants.”Schmidle described one exercise during the two-day training in which instructors simulated Black Lives Matter activists converging with Trump supporters and riot police ― the type of tense situation journalists may confront in Cleveland sometime next week.Charlotte Klein provided research assistance. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
26,POLITICS,Did Ruth Bader Ginsburg Cross The Line With Her Donald Trump Comments?,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump_us_5783af3de4b01edea78ea5c8,Some court observers are crying foul over her comments about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.,2016-07-11,Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent interviews have made it clear where she stands on presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5783bb5e1a00002700dd09fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hasn’t been shy in recent days about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, joking that she might move to New Zealand if it ever happens.“I can’t imagine what this place would be ― I can’t imagine what the country would be ― with Donald Trump as our president,” Ginsburg told The New York Times in an article published Sunday. “For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be ― I don’t even want to contemplate that.”That tracks a comment she made in a separate interview with The Associated Press, when the justice stopped short of noting she’d rather have presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton making future appointments to the Supreme Court.“I don’t want to think about that possibility,” Ginsburg said when asked to consider Trump in the role of appointer-in-chief. Now a number of legal academics and Supreme Court observers are raising questions about the propriety of Ginsburg’s candor and what it might mean for the court’s integrity ― with some suggesting she might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case that reaches the high court.“The other justices should hold an intervention, and tell her to be quiet or step down,” wrote Josh Blackman, a Houston College of Law professor who frequently writes about the high court. “This isn’t funny anymore.” He added that Ginsburg’s comments are “beyond the pale.”Rick Hasen, another avid court watcher who specializes in election law, wrote that Ginsburg’s statements could very well lead a “reasonable person” to question her impartiality in a future politically charged case.“I think this is ultimately a question for judicial ethicists, but I do think following these comments it is a legitimate question to raise, should Donald Trump’s campaign come to the Court with any legal questions before the election,” he wrote in his widely read Election Law Blog.Dmitry Bam, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law who has written on judicial recusals and ethics, said “there is little question that she has crossed a line.”“For a court that cares a great deal about appearances, this certainly creates the appearance that justices take sides in elections,” Bam wrote in an email. “And if Trump v. Clinton arises in the fall, I would say that there is at the very least an appearance of bias if Justice Ginsburg participates.”Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their “impartiality might reasonably be questioned” ― and they did so in 180 cases during the court’s last term, according to a new analysis by Fix the Court, a group that pushes for structural reform at the Supreme Court.Fix the Court found that the bulk of recent recusals were due to the justices’ prior work as appellate judges or in government positions. Other recusals were related to stock ownership and family ties to judges or lawyers who participated in earlier stages of the cases.But recusals for political views or implicit support for certain positions are exceedingly rare, even in the face of a code of judicial conduct that guides federal judges on extra-judicial activities and how to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.Even with that guidance and other self-imposed checks in place, the justices have time and again declined to step aside in cases of high political salience ― most recently in the same-sex marriage cases, where Ginsburg and Justices Elena Kagan and Clarence Thomas all took part despite calls for them to recuse.But Ginsburg’s Trump comments ― as well as her separate endorsement of Merrick Garland, the president’s stalled choice to fill the Scalia vacancy ― may be unprecedented.“I’m not aware [that] any justice before has ever commented on the merits or demerits of a presidential candidate,” said Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a frequent contributor to the conservative National Review Online, where he has chronicled this episode and what he deems Ginsburg’s “remarkable record of indiscretions.”“I may very well share her concerns about Donald Trump ... but the ethics concerns don’t depend on the soundness or unsoundness of the candidate,” Whelan added.But what if this is less a question about ethics and more about wanting our judges to be candid about their positions and biases ― and that the political process itself has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical?“Most people now recognize that judges are heavily influenced by their personal beliefs and experiences,” said Bam, of the Maine School of Law.“We have watched one party refuse to hold hearings based the politics of the president and his potential nominees. Judges time their retirements to coincide with a certain party being in office. And the 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore, along partisan lines, also shows the political nature of the court,” Bam said. “So perhaps the pretense that judges are nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good.”"
27,POLITICS,Not All Democrats Think Hillary Clinton Should Be Cleared Of Wrongdoing In Email Scandal,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-emails-poll_us_57839face4b01edea78e9231,Some also say the issue makes them worry about her decision-making if she becomes president.,2016-07-11,"According to a recent poll, nearly one-third of Democratic respondents say Hillary Clinton's email investigation makes them worry about how she might handle her responsibilities as president.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5783a06d1b00002700f6d27c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fifty-six percent of Americans disagree with FBI director James Comey’s recommendation to clear Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing for her email practices as secretary of state, according to an ABC/Washington Post poll released on Monday. Unsurprisingly, Republicans are united in their stance on the issue: Eighty-eight percent of those polled disagree with Comey’s recommendation not to charge Clinton with a crime. But perhaps a less anticipated finding of the poll is that Democrats aren’t completely unified in their perception of the issue. While 6 in 10 Democrats polled agree with Comey’s recommendation, a significant portion ― 31 percent― disagree with it. Republican respondents almost unanimously say that the email issue makes them worried about how Clinton will handle responsibilities if she is elected president. Most Democrats polled ― 68 percent ― don’t see a connection between how Clinton handled her email and how she would handle her responsibilities as president if she wins. Yet, about one-third of Democratic respondents say the issue does cause them to worry. Independents lean closer to Republicans on the Clinton email issue. About 60 percent of respondents who identify as independents disagree with the recommendation to clear Clinton, and a nearly equal portion express worry about the outcome and what it says about her decision-making if she becomes president.The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent points out there are a striking number of young and liberal voters among those who disagree with Comey’s decision and worry about Clinton’s decision-making. Sargent suggests that the nearly one-third of Democrats who oppose the majority of their party on the issue might be supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). There is, however, a silver lining for Clinton to be found in the data. Even though Democrats somewhat disagree on whether Comey made the right call, the ABC/Post poll shows it’s unlikely to dissuade them from voting for Clinton. Seventy-three percent of Democrats polled say the outcome makes no difference in their vote, and 16 percent say it makes them more likely to vote for Clinton. Just 9 percent say the outcome makes them less likely to vote for her.The Huffington Post Pollster general election chart, which aggregates all publicly available polls, shows Clinton leading in the presidential race with 46 percent of the vote to presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump’s 40 percent. She also holds 81 percent of the vote among Democrats.  The ABC/Washington Post poll surveyed 519 American adults on July 6-7 using live interviewers. The poll has a 5 percent margin of error. "

Instead, GOP officials voted to reaffirm the party’s opposition to gay adoption, same-sex marriage, abortion and transgender individuals using public restrooms ― issues that generally have seen great progress in recent years.The Platform Committee, one of several committees meeting prior to next week’s Republican National Convention, gathered in downtown Cleveland to spell out the party’s core principles and values for the next four years. The language the committee ultimately settles on is not binding, however ― officials have ignored its provisions in the past. But the document can help reveal the direction of party, and, especially this year, crystalize the differences between it and its presumptive standard bearer, real estate mogul Donald Trump.Deep in the bowels of the Huntington Convention Center, a subcommittee handling health care, education and crime passed several controversial amendments curtailing LGBT rights, despite protests that the party would unnecessarily alienate voters ahead of the general election. The full committee is set to vote on the changes later in the week.New York delegate Annie Dickerson, a longtime adviser to Paul Singer, a Republican megadonor who has championed gay and lesbian rights, mounted the most strenuous objections to several controversial amendments presented before the committee. Dickerson argued that the party ought to leave such issues to state legislatures in order to avoid antagonizing gay voters. Over and over, however, she was rebuffed by her colleagues, who seemed to be led at times by prominent social conservative and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins.The subcommittee decided to keep language in two separate amendments that calls for legislation to keep transgender people from using public restrooms that align with their gender identity ― a nod to over 200 bills targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals that were introduced in the 2016 legislative session nationwide.Dickerson protested, noting the committee was even at odds with Trump, who had said he would allow a transgender person in any bathroom at his signature Manhattan property Trump Tower. (He has since reversed his position, however, coming out in support of North Carolina’s anti-LGBT law.) “Talking about bathrooms, it takes away from party in general,” Dickerson said, before calling the issue a “rabbit hole.” “For us to voice this, I think it’ll be wrong for those of us who have gay family members, coworkers, neighbors. They are our friends. It should be about addition, and not subtraction,” she later added.Julie Adams, a delegate from Kentucky, agreed. “It’s mind-boggling to me that we would elevate it to this extent,” she said. “I believe the GOP is big tent. I believe this is overkill.”But North Carolina delegate Mary Forrester wasn’t moved. “Bathrooms aren’t the issue,” she said. “It is locker rooms, dressing rooms.” The Tar Heel state has been at the center of the controversy after Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed an anti-LGBT law earlier this year. He was forced to amend the law, however, after significant outcry from the state’s businesses community.Perhaps as a recognition of the significance of the vote, Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus briefly made an appearance in the back of the room. He did not make remarks, however, preferring to look on silently and huddle with staff outside. Debate over gay adoption took a similar turn. Some subcommittee members pushed for the platform to include an amendment saying “a loving and stable home” was the best place to raise a child ― rather than its initial assertion that children benefit from homes with a “mother and father.” “I object to allowing discrimination against gays from adopting children. I think this is blatant discrimination. We should support loving adoption,” Dickerson said, before seeing yet another amendment aimed at tempering her platform go down in flames.Committee members also clashed over issues of marriage equality and religious liberty. Delegates ultimately voted to retain language calling for a constitutional amendment on same-sex marriage, and reaffirmed their opposition to abortion. Trump, who has said while campaigning that women should face “some sort of punishment” if they have an abortion, for years supported a woman’s right to do so legally. Retired Gen. Michael Flynn, one of Trump’s possible vice presidential running mates, has had a similar change of opinion: He called himself “pro-life” on Monday, one day after saying he believed women had the right to choose. Delegates added to the pile of hot-button topics by unanimously adopting an amendment that called pornography “a public health crisis” and “public menace” that is destroying lives. The measure went further than the 2012 GOP platform, which mainly focused on problems with child pornography. FRC’s Perkins also succeeded in introducing an amendment to the platform affirming “the right of parents to determine the proper treatment or therapy, for their minor children,” a reference to gay conversion therapy, which has been banned in a number of states.When the Restoring Constitutional Government subcommittee met in a convention room, Nevada delegate Jesse Law proposed adding a few words to include LGBT individuals in the section discussing basic rights. One delegate suggested replacing “LGBT” with “gender,” wondering if that wouldn’t cover it. But then a Virginia delegate, saying that he sensed there wasn’t much support in the room for the idea, moved to table Law’s amendment. More than a dozen delegates chimed in to second that, and it passed by a near unanimous voice vote.Law played down the result in an interview with The Huffington Post. “The committee as a whole is pro-LGBT,” he said. “It’s just what I recommended wasn’t accepted. So they’re focusing on individual rights.”Outside groups have been pushing to moderate the party’s platform, especially on same-sex marriage. But it’s unclear where Trump stands on some changes. His campaign has been happy to stand by and let the committee do its work.Perkins told reporters following Monday’s proceedings that this year’s platform ― including its anti-LGBT provisions ― are as “strong as” the document that delegates passed in 2012. He said the amendments passed in his committee represent “where most Republicans are” on policy.But Tennessee delegate Connie Hunter did not sound as approving. She found the amendments passed by the committee on Monday “a bit exclusionary,” and worried delegates were overly specific.“Well, they’re probably not going to read it because it’s going to be so long so it probably doesn’t matter,” Hunter told HuffPost, when asked if she felt the measures would ostracize voters. “There’s nobody that’s going to read this big ol’ platform.”S.V.

So they’re focusing on individual rights.”Outside groups have been pushing to moderate the party’s platform, especially on same-sex marriage. But it’s unclear where Trump stands on some changes. His campaign has been happy to stand by and let the committee do its work.Perkins told reporters following Monday’s proceedings that this year’s platform ― including its anti-LGBT provisions ― are as “strong as” the document that delegates passed in 2012. He said the amendments passed in his committee represent “where most Republicans are” on policy.But Tennessee delegate Connie Hunter did not sound as approving. She found the amendments passed by the committee on Monday “a bit exclusionary,” and worried delegates were overly specific.“Well, they’re probably not going to read it because it’s going to be so long so it probably doesn’t matter,” Hunter told HuffPost, when asked if she felt the measures would ostracize voters. “There’s nobody that’s going to read this big ol’ platform.”S.V.

There was no violence reported and only three arrests were made, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The protest, which was against the recent police killings of black lives, was organized in part by the local NAACP chapter who praised police for practicing “exemplary” behavior during the demonstration. The organization told the AJC they contacted the city prior to the protest to inform them of their plans, and applauded Atlanta officers for their patience and “restraint.” “They were patient and sensitive… (even when) it sort of got away from us,” Richard Rose, the president of Atlanta’s NAACP chapter, told the paper. “We started great for the first couple of hours, then the frustration… and the outrage was tough to contain. The police showed restraint.”One Atlanta resident recorded a powerful moment on camera showing a hoard of protesters yelling chants as they marched through city: Around 200 Atlanta police officers along with Georgia State Patrol officers were deployed to help cover the protest, none of whom were equipped with or dressed in riot gear. “If it’s not necessary, then many times it is advantageous to have normally uniformed officers in place,” Atlanta Police Major T Darin Schierbaum told the AJC. “The key is our continuing effort to build relationships with the community — to know and be in dialog with community groups when there are not times of tension,” he said. “Atlanta historically is an area of peaceful protests. The police department trains for that, trains for not taking a confrontational stance.”America, take note. "

33,POLITICS,Corporate Lobbyist Jumps Into Senate Race To Replace Retiring Lobbyist,Ryan Grim and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/evan-bayh-senate-race-lobbyist_us_5783c8e3e4b0344d515030eb,And it's good news for Democrats.,2016-07-11,"Evan Bayh, who previously served as U.S. senator from Indiana, is now jumping into the 2016 race to retake the seat.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5783cbf11a00002600dd0a82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON - A Democratic corporate lobbyist is jumping into a Senate race to fill a seat made vacant by the retirement of a Republican corporate lobbyist. The news is a major boon to Democrats, who are looking to retake the Senate, and also to people looking for evidence that the political system is deeply corrupt. The general practice of rotating from public office into the private sector and back again is deeply ingrained, but one particular Indiana Senate seat has hosted more than its share of special interest romps. Since at least 1989, the seat has been occupied by either a former or a soon-to-be lobbyist.Republican Dan Coats retired from his decade of service in the Senate in 1999 and became a lobbyist for banks, weapons makers and large technology firms. (Coats had been appointed to replace Dan Quayle, who gave up the seat to become the most ridiculed vice president of the second half of the 20th century.) He was replaced by Democrat Evan Bayh, the son of an extraordinarily popular progressive senator, Birch Bayh.When Evan Bayh retired from the Senate in 2010, Coats returned to the seat. And now Coats is retiring a second time, so the seat is again available, and Bayh wants it. If Bayh wins, that means the seat’s occupancy, dating to the 1960s, will go Bayh-Quayle-Coats-Bayh-Coats-Bayh.Evan Bayh went out the first time with a widely read column in The New York Times condemning the Senate’s dysfunction and promising he’d be returning to Indiana to teach. “I want to be engaged in an honorable line of work,” he said in an interview at the time. He quickly thought better of it, and instead signed on with McGuireWoods, where he joined the lobbying campaign to repeal the medical device tax, which plays a role in financing the Affordable Care Act. A deficit scold while in the Senate, Bayh as a lobbyist was involved in two marquee efforts to jack up the deficit. (Bayh did not officially register as a lobbyist, as many at his high level decline to do.) Bayh, apparently soothed of his concern about political dysfunction, signed up as a contributor to Fox News. He then joined the private equity firm Apollo and pushed against efforts to close the carried-interest loophole, which famously allows money managers to pay laughably low tax rates by pretending their income isn’t income, but instead comes from capital gains, even if they don’t put up their own money. In addition, Bayh signed up with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest corporate lobby, to lead a PR campaign in opposition to regulations promulgated by the Obama administration. This effort sought to roll back or block the implementation of regulations at the Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission and the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Given Bayh’s family legacy and his own popularity, he has a reasonable shot at retaking the seat now, which would mean Democrats would control both Senate seats from Indiana despite the state typically trending Republican. Because of the way the Senate gives disproportionate power to small, rural states, which trend conservative ― Alaska and California, for instance, have the same level of representation ― Democrats, in order to control the chamber, need to hold on to seats in unlikely states such as Indiana. That puts progressives in the unpleasant position of rooting for a former senator who spent his political career calling for cuts to social spending and to programs like Medicare and Social Security, and who also spent his private years advocating for regressive policies. (At least there’s the benefit that disclosure forms will require Bayh to let the public know just how lucrative his decision not to go into teaching was.)Baron Hill, who had been the Democratic nominee for the seat, was trailing in the race badly and announced Monday that he would step aside, which will allow Bayh to take his place on the ballot. Hill shouldn’t have a hard time finding his next gig. He was a registered lobbyist working in opposition to the medical device tax as recently as February. As Bayh wrote about the dysfunctions of Congress in his farewell op-ed in The New York Times, “Special interests are entrenched.”Like this story?

Harris-Perry tweeted on Monday that she was “thrilled” about her new role:Harris-Perry, who hosted a weekend morning show on MSNBC for four years, left the network earlier this year after her show was pre-empted multiple times for election coverage. “After four years of building an audience, developing a brand, and developing trust with our viewers, we were effectively and utterly silenced,” she wrote in a letter to her staff. “Now, MSNBC would like me to appear for four inconsequential hours to read news that they deem relevant without returning to our team any of the editorial control and authority that makes MHP Show distinctive.”“The purpose of this decision seems to be to provide cover for MSNBC, not to provide voice for MHP Show,” she continued. “I will not be used as a tool for their purposes.

35,POLITICS,Republicans Left Wondering If Donald Trump Will Kill The Party Or Just Maim It,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gop-control_us_5782d526e4b0c590f7e9ec0d,The party of Lincoln contemplates how to take the reins from the party of Trump.,2016-07-11,Republican activists wonder how they can retake control of their party in the aftermath of Donald Trump's nomination. Trump has won over a plurality of GOP primary voters with an agenda that has little in common with the party's longtime goals.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5782d6651b00002600f6d137.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Next week, the party of “four score and seven years ago” and “Mr. Gorbechev, tear down this wall” is set to become the party of I’m building a wall and the judge is Mexican.Real estate developer-turned-reality TV star Donald Trump, barring an unlikely revolt by convention delegates in the coming days, will officially become the Republican nominee for president of the United States.The party founded to abolish slavery, and which five decades ago became the home of modern conservatism, will be led for at least the next four months, and possibly the next eight years, by a bullying entertainer with a checkered business record, little apparent knowledge or interest in governing, a long history of insults toward women and marginalized ethnic groups, and a professed admiration for dictators.“The Republican Party is supposed to be the party of conservative principles. What’s happening right now is a meltdown of the Republican Party,” said New Jersey’s Steve Lonegan, who supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s bid for the nomination and is now running a super PAC to help party activists trying to strip Trump of the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.“We’re going to be looking at this for years, trying to understand this,” he added. “It will be analyzed in the books for a decade or two or three.”Republicans like Lonegan, of course, have a more immediate question: What now?How does a party that sent Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan to the Oval Office retake control from a man who has compared his fears of venereal diseases with fighting in a war and who accused the last Republican president of intentionally lying to the country to win support for an invasion ― but who went on to win the nomination anyway?“I cannot in good conscience support someone that I know will be a disaster for our nation and our party,” said Beau Correll, a Virginia convention delegate who is suing that state to invalidate a law requiring him to vote according to the result of the March 1 primary, which Trump won.“If we continue with Trump, it’s going to be total annihilation,” he said.Many Republicans also worry that Trump’s disorganized campaign and high disapproval ratings make a victory all but impossible, but others have an even more fundamental concern.“There’s even a greater fear,” one Republican National Committee member said. “What if he really gets elected? Now what do we do?”Other Republicans are less shy about that possibility. It would be a catastrophe, they say, and it cannot be allowed to happen.“Whatever Hillary Clinton’s faults, she’s not ignorant or hateful or a nut,” wrote Mark Salter, who was a senior strategist to Arizona Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. “She acts like an adult, and understands the responsibilities of an American president.”In such a partisan time, and with as polarizing an opponent as Clinton, relatively few Republicans are likely to openly back the other side. Preventing Trump from remaking the party in his own image, however, is a much more readily accepted goal across the GOP’s spectrum.“This is a pivotal moment in history,” said Kendal Unruh, the Colorado leader of the “Free the Delegates” movement to encourage fellow delegates to modify the convention rules in the coming week to dump Trump.Yet reaching a consensus on what should replace Trump’s agenda could prove more difficult than imagined ― for the same reasons that Trump was able to win the nomination in the first place. Trump’s victories in the primaries revealed an enormous gulf between what GOP leaders believe their voters want and what those voters actually want.All of Trump’s rivals for the nomination hit the usual themes that appeal to the Republican “three-legged stool.” They warned social conservatives about threats to religious freedom, guaranteed economic conservatives big tax cuts and rallied foreign-policy conservatives with promises of a more aggressive use of the military.Meanwhile, Trump smashed the stool until it shattered, focusing his campaign largely on building a wall along the United States’ border with Mexico, raising tariffs, and bombing and torturing terrorists and their families.The message resonated with the rarely acknowledged fourth leg of that allegorical stool: a segment of the white population, disproportionately Southern and disproportionately undereducated, that has little interest in lower capital gains taxes or fewer business regulations.Rather, Trump’s racially tinged promise to “make America great again” harkens back to a time when a high school diploma, and sometimes not even that, was all that was necessary to make a middle-class living in a country that was overwhelmingly white.“What they want to do is go back to 1956. And it’s just not going to happen,” said Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Republican consultant who served as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s campaign manager in 1994. “If that’s who we are, then we’re headed for the ash heap of history.”Unfortunately for Republicans like Stipanovich, those white, working-class, resentful-of-how-America-has-changed voters appear to make up between 25 and 35 percent of the Republican base. They are the thousands of supporters who fill gyms and arenas around the country to take in Trump rallies. They are the reason the South, despite its high proportion of religious conservatives, supported a thrice-married New Yorker with a shaky theological background who has said he has never sought God’s forgiveness.Should the “Dump Trump” activists succeed in the days ahead, the party faces the real possibility that the millions of GOP voters who support Trump will stay home in November, almost certainly guaranteeing a Democratic Senate and possibly even a Democratic House.“If they try to yank it from him, it would be utterly catastrophic for them,” said Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. “You would have at least 1,000 delegates on the floor who were strong supporters of his go ballistic. There would be blood on the floor. It would be a bigger disaster for them than swallowing hard and running with Trump on the ticket.”That Trump will lose this fall seems a foregone conclusion to the anti-Trump Republicans. The only question is by how much, and whether the size of that defeat will affect how quickly and effectively the party can rebuild for coming elections.Stipanovich believes it would be best for Trump to lose big ― to be “clubbed like a baby seal,” as he likes to put it.“There’s been this mythology that the reason we haven’t won big races is because we haven’t been crazy enough,” he said, adding that a crushing loss should teach a valuable lesson. “I hope this puts that to rest. ... It’ll be good for the party in the long-term. To get this idea that ‘we have to be crazy in order to win’ out of our system.”Lonegan is not sure about that theory. A blow-out Trump loss would endanger Republican control of both chambers of Congress, in his view. The only path to take back the White House is replacing Trump at the convention with an actual conservative candidate who has a fighting chance of beating Clinton, Lonegan said, adding that such a candidate would, win or lose, certainly help retain the Senate and House.In any event, an aggressive “Dump Trump” movement will at the very least start the post-election reconstruction process.“It’s a necessary battle because we can lay the groundwork for rebuilding,” Lonegan said. “I think the country benefits when you have a liberal Democratic Party and a conservative Republican Party.”The two views reflect the stark split between the party’s establishment and cultural wings. It was the establishment group ― including allies of Jeb Bush and his brother, former President George W. Bush ― that wrote the “autopsy” of Mitt Romney’s 2012 loss. That 2013 “Growth and Opportunity Project” report urged an immigration overhaul that provided legal status to some 11 million undocumented immigrants. In the view of the authors, a more inclusive party that drew in Latinos and members of other racial groups was the only long-term solution.But that, according to Lonegan and others in the Cruz wing, was exactly the wrong approach. The Senate’s failed “Gang of Eight” legislation helped alienate the voting base, as did the inability of a Republican-led House and Senate to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law or cut spending or follow through on any of the other promises they made in the 2010 and 2014 midterms to block Obama’s agenda.GOP voters could be forgiven for seeing little difference between the parties, Lonegan said.“To the average voter, it all looks the same in Washington,” he said.On the far side of that intraparty chasm, the establishment wing blames that all-or-nothing, no-compromise tone for setting unreasonable expectations in the first place, and Cruz is seen as Exhibit A for how not to move the party forward ― sort of a Trump figure with a somewhat more civil tongue.This rift should sound familiar to those following the GOP in recent years. It’s been cleaving the party since the George H.W. Bush presidency 25 years ago, and has become an open civil war since the second George W. Bush term a decade ago. In that period, Republicans have lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. Stipanovich wondered when the message that the party needs to grow its base, not retreat into it, will sink in.“I don’t know how many more times that we need to go to the polls before we convince them of that,” he said.To Ornstein ― who over the years has come to believe that a dysfunctional Republican Party is largely to blame for official Washington’s failure to solve the nation’s biggest problems ― the party factions’ inability to agree on how to deal with Trump foreshadows the difficulty they will face regrouping after November.The worst possible outcome for Lincoln’s party: It will have learned nothing from its hostile takeover by a celebrity entertainer with a gift for loudly repeating the things its voting base wants to hear, Ornstein said.Unfortunately, the way battle lines are being drawn already, and with the all-but-certain-to-continue agitation by talk show hosts and others in the conservative ecosystem, the same factors that allowed a Trump nomination will remain in place after November, Ornstein predicted.“I just don’t see any resolution to this for a long time,” he said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

40,BUSINESS,Tech CEO Celebrates Marissa Mayer For All The Wrong Reasons,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marissa-mayer-overwork_us_5783ca9ce4b01edea78eccdd,Working 24/7 shouldn’t be an automatic badge of honor.,2016-07-11,"Max Levchin, PayPal cofounder and chief executive officer of Affirm.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5783ee4b1a000024006f9b6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is so committed to her job that just minutes after giving birth she was back to work, a friend and Silicon Valley entrepreneur recently boasted. “[Mayer] is by far the hardest working person in Silicon Valley,” Max Levchin told Pando’s Sarah Lacy. “She gave birth to twins and then traded emails with me about a feature of a product she was launching in a week, within, from what I could tell, 20 minutes of giving birth,” said the PayPal cofounder, speaking before a group of people. The audience tittered. “She is intensely committed to her cause. She’s awesome,” said Levchin, who is now devoted mainly to a new consumer finance startup called Affirm. He also talked about how much he respects Mayer for being a pioneer and one of the few women to ascend to such a high level in tech. “She is a woman who rose through the ranks in the male-dominated world,” he said. “I think that’s pretty special.”Levchin’s comments do more than just celebrate his friend, though. Applauding such an extreme work ethic sends a pretty clear message to those interested in growing and developing their careers: Work all the time and give up everything if you want to succeed. Every time an influential person makes a statement like Levchin’s ― celebrating someone’s obvious personal sacrifice, it sets both men and women back just a bit. If work culture demands us to always put work first ― even during precious once-in-a-lifetime moments ― then we’re all in trouble. What’s also troubling about Levchin’s comments is that he would never have made them about a man. A male CEO who sends a work email just moments after his wife gave birth would hardly be remarkable.Because, first: that’s expected. And second, women, particularly mothers, are held to some truly impossible standards. Some will judge you as a bad mother for working so soon after giving birth (and many have judged Mayer). Others will see this as a sign you’re a great worker.But really it’s neither of those things. Putting in long hours and sacrificing your personal life doesn’t necessarily mean you’re a great worker or, on the flip side, doing anything wrong in the parenting realm.Working 24/7 just means you’ve given in to the absurd cult of overwork. There’s really no need to celebrate that fact.On a personal level, the massive downsides to the cult are obvious: No one dies regretting that they didn’t work more, is the old cliche. Time with your new baby or your kids is time you will never ever get back.Professionally speaking, more people are realizing that working all the time doesn’t lead to excellence. It can often lead to burnout and poor decision making. It can lead more workers to quit their jobs or suffer from work-related stress. More often, the pressure to always be on ― to respond to emails during childbirth, in the middle of the night, from your kids’ graduation ― means we get trapped in what one researcher at the Harvard Business School calls, “the cycle of responsiveness.”“We don’t think about better, faster, and more effective ways of working,” Leslie Perlow wrote for Harvard Business Review in 2012. “Rather, we just keep working more and more, perpetuating and amplifying the bad intensity in our work — those unnecessary iterations, the lack of communication and alignment, the last-minute, late-night changes and those weekend “emergencies” that get in the way of doing our best at work and having time for life outside of work.”Taking breaks and time off can be good for your productivity, giving you time to pull back from the minutia of the everyday to focus on more big picture thinking.“Our research shows that being always available is actually dysfunctional for everyone at some level,” Erin Reid, an assistant professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business, recently told The Huffington Post. Yet, many workplaces don’t value time off ― instead reinforcing a culture of hard-charging overwork, as evidenced by Levchin’s remarks. At another point in the interview he and Lacy joke about how during PayPal’s early days, Levchin would work next to a box of T-shirts. He’d pull an all-nighter, stink up a shirt and then pull another one out of the box. “It’s really not your body that smells,” he said, to explain why this is an effective strategy to avoid stinking. For a recent research paper, Reid looked at a consulting firm where overwork was so expected, men just lied and pretended to work 80 hour weeks in order to get ahead. If they were upfront about their commitment to family ― and sometimes prioritized their personal lives ― they were penalized with fewer promotions.I’m not here to judge Mayer for working right after childbirth. She was already put through the wringer after announcing she’d work throughout her two week long maternity leave. She runs a public company ― one that’s going through a very rocky time ― and she can choose to structure her life any way she wants. She’s only one of an extremely rare breed ― a female CEO in the Fortune 500. There are only about 20 other women on that list.Mayer herself has been open about her choices and the fact that she is, truly, exceptional ― as one of the very few young female CEOs out there. But if we continue to only laud and value women and men who work 24/7 as the best kind of workers, we’ll probably continue to have only about 20 women on the Fortune 500. Because, it’s often women who must make a choice: Send emails 20 minutes after giving birth, or slow down your career trajectory. Many of us choose the exit lane.The idea that we need to celebrate overwork and hold that up as exemplifying some kind of gold standard of work, though, is the issue.Why didn’t Levchin talk about an amazing insight or decision Mayer’s made? No one remembers Steve Jobs for his overwork, but for his ideas. Ideas don’t always require you to work at 2 a.m. on a Saturday or while nursing your infant.Yet, in certain circles, sacrificing your personal life ― working flat out at all hours ― still signifies that you’re a good worker. That’s sure to be a turn-off to a lot of people picking a career track.If the tech industry is serious about its commitment to hire more diverse workers ― people of color, women, older workers, parents ― they can’t send the message that working in the industry requires a complete disavowal of your life.Unless that’s truly what it takes."

U.N. war crimes investigators later excavated the mass graves, but over 1,000 bodies are still missing.Most Serbs, both in Bosnia and Serbia whose 1990s leadership armed and funded Bosnian Serb forces, strongly deny that the massacre was genocide as judged by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia.They dispute the death toll and the official account of what happened, reflecting conflicting narratives about how and why Yugoslavia broke up in bloodshed. That divide continues to hinder reconciliation and stifle Bosnia’s progress toward integration with Western Europe.
