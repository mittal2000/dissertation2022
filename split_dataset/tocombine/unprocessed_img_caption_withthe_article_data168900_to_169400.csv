All collegiate and professional sports teams travel, and if you're a big sports fan like me, then may have actually learned geography from watching sports. Or, if you grew up traveling and weren't into sports, then you were likely exposed to international sports at some point on your travels.Yes, I've traveled to every country in the world, but I have many passions in my life. And sports are one of my greatest passions. I grew up playing and watching all kinds of sports, they were all I thought about as a kid. I loved them then, and I still do.Sports helped me learn geography. By the time I was six years old, I knew every sports team in every major professional sport in America and Canada. I knew the cities they played, and the states or provinces that they were in. How else would a six-year-old American kid from Trumbull, Connecticut know where Winnipeg, Edmonton, Green Bay, Portland and Quebec City were?That knowledge also led me to study maps as a kid. I learned about every country in the world and every capital city. I didn't travel as a kid, but I was always fascinated by the world and liked to know about it. I was always curious and wanted to know everything.As I got older and eventually made some money, I started traveling around the states to different stadiums. I wanted -- and still do want -- to visit every sports stadium. It is a lofty goal, but it's a goal that has helped me visit many cities and states. It has been a huge motivating factor in my greater travel goals.When I finally left America for the first time, at 20-years-old, I discovered soccer. As a desperate sports fan living in London in fall 1998, I yearned for live sports. In 1998, satellite TV and the Internet wasn't nearly what it is today.To put it into perspective, I still hand-wrote letters -- not emails -- back home. I was a day delayed getting sports scores, until the USA Today arrived at London newsstands and I could follow the 1998 Home Run race and the Yankees record-breaking season.As a result, I started following soccer. I started following Arsenal religiously, and soon branched out into the other European leagues, especially La Liga in Spain, where I adopted FC Barcelona as my team because I loved the city so much when I visited.While living in Europe, and during each of the 80-plus times I've been back since 1998, I tried to plan my trips around soccer games -- which are hopefully at new stadiums that I haven't yet been to. At this point, I have been to nearly every major stadium in Europe. That said, it never gets old, so I will never get tired of it.Travel also introduced me to other sports. In 2003, while spending a year in Australia and New Zealand, I got really into rugby as the Rugby World Cup was held in Australia that year. I got really into it -- I still love the Rugby World Cup and have become a huge All Blacks fan. I also follow Tri-Nations, Sevens and all other major competitions around the world.I can say the same for several other sports like Aussie-Rules Football, Hurling, Hockey, Sumo, Handball and many more. The only sport I just can't get into is Cricket, and I have tried several times. I just don't get it!That all said, I am not trying to brag about the sports events and stadiums I've been to, but I am trying to illustrate how sports and travel can go together and impact each other, whether you intended it or not. That's the beauty of both sports and travel. They are two things that you can do your whole life.My favorite place in the world is probably Yankee Stadium in New York. I have been over 1,000 times, and each time I still love it. The same can be said for Emirates Stadium in London or the Nou Camp in Barcelona or the San Siro in Milan. I can't wait until the next time I am at each one. It doesn't matter who is playing, it's just the experience of the game and the experience in the city. Each stadium is different for culture and traditions.It doesn't matter if you see a game at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, a game at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev or a game at the Bell Centre in Montreal. All are fun, different and each one will take you to another great city in a great country. Sports and travel go together and that is a beautiful thing!"

But donￂﾒt wait much longer: It takes about two weeks for the vaccineￂﾒs protection to kick in.

Some look forward to hanging stockings and decorating trees, others ringing in the New Year. However, the onset of winter does mean one thing for everyone, regardless of which holiday you celebrate: Flu season is upon us. With the onset of flu season, it is perhaps worth looking into some of the ethical and practical issues that surround the virus. These days the flu is -- in general -- a relatively banal ailment. It might knock one out of commission for a few days and relegate you to lying in bed slurping down chicken noodle soup. However, with a little rest and nourishment, chances are you will have recovered in no time at all.Such a rosy scenario was not always the status quo. Historically, some strains of the flu -- or influenza as it's more formally known -- have shown themselves to be incredibly contagious and lethal, given to wiping out large portions of the population. Consider the deadly flu pandemic that occurred in 1918 and -- over the course of three years -- was responsible for the deaths of somewhere around 50 million people worldwide. To put that number into perspective, that is more people than were killed in the Civil War, Vietnam, the Holocaust, the Napoleonic Wars and World War I combined. All told , just under 3 percent of the world's population perished. In the United States, there has been an ongoing process to combat both the serious and not-so-serious strains of the virus. ""Flu shots"" are vaccines that were first developed in the 1940s, and their use has gradually become more and more prevalent throughout the population. Currently, the CDC recommends, ""everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine each year.""On the surface, such a program seems completely straightforward. Historically, the process of vaccination has been a firmly-embedded principle in medical literature. Many vaccinate children -- and adults -- against all different types of debilitating and horrifying illnesses from mumps, to smallpox, to polio. However, there are several ethical considerations that we must keep in mind when promoting a program of vaccination. These considerations apply especially when we talk about a virus like the flu, which is much more common (and also of course much less severe in most cases) than smallpox or typhoid or any of the other diseases that we typically vaccinate against.The first issue that is worth looking into is that of perceived security. By developing a vaccine against the flu, there is a perception that we have in some way beaten it and will be protected against becoming infected. This is not always the case. Every year those in charge of developing that year's vaccine choose which strains of the virus to include and which to leave out. This complicated process can essentially be boiled down to a risk analysis; only the most lethal and contagious mutations of the virus need apply. In some sense, this leads to a false perception that because one is vaccinated one is immune to all possible strains of the flu. This is simply false; one is simply protected against the most likely and most dangerous known strains that are included in the vaccine, not the virus in its entirety. Furthermore, this sense of perceived security may make us less likely to engage in preventative behaviors we would normally utilize. Just because you are vaccinated does not mean you shouldn't try and limit your exposure, eat well, wash your hands, and get plenty of rest. In an ideal world, behavioral interventions would work hand-in-hand with vaccines; however, this isn't always the case. Shifting things around a bit, let's assume that there was massive uptake of the CDC's directive for everyone to be vaccinated, motivated perhaps by fears of another pandemic, similar to that of 1918. In this case, it's possible that we could end up in a situation where there would not be nearly enough vaccines to go around -- particularly if the deadly and virulent strain were late in being identified as a threat (ramping up production of a vaccine for a particular strain takes at least six months). This problem of resource allocation has been a hotly-debated medical ethics issue for years. With limited supply, you face at least one incredibly hard ethical question: Who gets the vaccines, and why do they get them instead of someone else? There have been all types of principled strategies advanced for who should receive resources (vaccines, treatments) in times of crisis (first come first served, evaluating medical histories, treating medical professionals and caregivers before all others, etc.). However, such an issue is incredibly complicated and worthy of its own separate article. Another relevant resource allocation issue is one of funding. Simply put, public health funding in this country -- or in any country for that matter -- is not infinite. In order to fund certain programs, others will be cut, so we must choose carefully when considering where to invest our limited funds. In essence, we need to determine how to get the biggest bang for our buck -- a question that becomes infinitely more complicated because it involves rating outcomes (quality of life vs. number of people treated, etc.). Are routine seasonal flu vaccines a cost-effective way of preventing the illness? Or are we expending precious funds that would do more good somewhere else? On the surface, the flu vaccine seems like a no-brainer. History has shown us that influenza can be a devastating and lethal disease worth attempting to control if not eradicate. However, looking more closely, we find that these apparent no-brainers do, in fact, present complicated policy questions that deserve careful consideration.For more by Nathan Risinger, click here.For more healthy living health news, click here."

This is the 23rd time the hotel has been built. The hotel encompasses 65 hotel rooms, a lobby and reception area, a main hall and an ice bar. As the hotel opens in phases, an ice chapel (for weddings, of course) will be opened later. Construction starts in November, CNN reports, when the temperature is several degrees below freezing. The first phase of the hotel opens in December, and the whole structure is completed by early January. More than just a hotel, the structure is considered ""an ephemeral art project"" by its creators. A handful of the suites were designed by artists selected from more than 100 applicants from around the world, according to the AFP. Yet, the canvas is fleeting, as it only lasts until warmer temperatures come. Interested in a stay at the ICEHOTEL? Double and twin rooms, as well as hotel chalets for three to five people (in a Scandinavian design) are available. And, outer wear, gloves, shoes, breakfast buffet, morning sauna are included. Rates vary, but a stay on Christmas will run about $480 for the night. The hotel also welcomes day visitors. Don't worry about being too cold though; in the hotel it never gets colder than 23 to 18 degrees fahrenheit, despite the outdoor temperature sometimes being as low as -22 degrees.For photos from this year's construction, as well as past ICEHOTEL incarnations, check out the slideshow below.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca1e72400005100534674.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I watched as my daughter Alexis Agin was buried. Two weeks shy of her fifth birthday, an insidious killer known as cancer took her life without mercy. We spent 33 months in the journey that ultimately culminated with the worst loss possible. We had time, most of it good, to come to terms with what unfolded before our eyes. Over the past week, we have all been inundated with the tragedy of Newton, Connecticut. It has been seared upon our collective consciousness. The thoughts of the children who were brutally murdered has not left my mind. Ordinarily, I am focused on childhood cancer and the quest to find a cure for this dreaded disease. With that said, there are now twenty sets of parents who will undertake the excruciating task of saying good bye to their children. From a father's perspective, the loss is different from that of a mother. We are strong. We are supposed to be strong. A lot of the focus is on the mother as we fathers are often left to deal with the emotional toll in a different manner. And thus, as the nation focuses upon the grieving parents, I thought I would share some thoughts. One grieving father to another.We do not ""get over"" this loss. The fallacy that as a parent we somehow ""get over"" the loss of a child is, frankly, maddening. When you lose a child, so much hope escapes with this loss. The hope of your child growing up, going to college, playing sports, marrying and having children of their own, it is all lost. Why would I want to ""get over"" the loss of my child? I will never ""get over"" my child. She was a part of me. She was my first-born and the love of my life. I was wrapped around her little finger from the moment I met her. Thankfully, I have never heard these words. I am however aware of other parents who have. They cut you. They startle in their frankness and harshness. And, although the people who say them are well meaning, the words do not take into account the magnitude of the loss. No, we will not ""get over"" the loss of a child.Nor will we ""move on."" Move on? I do not understand. Why would I ""move on"" from my child. I want to remain connected to the person who filled our house with such love and joy. I will never ""move on"" from my child. The thought of trying to move beyond my child or the loss is foreign. When someone says these words, I understand that they simply mean that you as a parent should try to put your life back together and live as best you can. The problem is that I picture these words. They conjure the physical thought of moving my earthly presence beyond that of my deceased child. And that simply does not sit well with me. I can live, and I can be as normal as my mind will allow me to be. Nevertheless, I do not ever want to ""move on"" from my child. I want to maintain whatever connection may hold us together, and that may be pain. I have found that as the weeks and months pass, and the initial numbness subsided after about six or so months, pain was and continues to be such a strong connecting concept. It is often through moments of the worst pain that Alexis is the closest. And thus, I embrace that pain. I accept it as a surrogate for her physical presence. It is a difficult and horrible substitute for her being here with me, but the reality is that it is sometimes all I have. And so, as a father who lost a child, you need to understand that there are times I do not want to be taken away from the pain. There are moments when the pain, though raw and open like a jagged cut, connect me with Alexis' spirit and earthly presence. I do not enjoy the pain, I simply accept the pain and the reality upon which it is based. Life as you know it ceased to exist. It simply was taken from you and you will never get it back. This is a very difficult concept for those who have not lost a child to understand. It does not mean that we are unrecognizable and will never be able to fit within what most believe to be ""normal"" society. Rather, it means that we will always bear that heavy burden of loss upon our shoulders. The loss of a child is that much different from the loss of any other person in our lives. In 2002, my only sibling, Gina Agin, was killed in a car accident. It was a sudden, tragic loss that still affects me to this day. I had no time to say goodbye or spend with her prior to her death. Yet, the loss of my child has touched me in a far different manner. It has changed every fabric of my being and transformed me beyond any concept of who I was previously. For me, I have embraced this change and found that I have a different purpose for myself as a childhood cancer advocate. I fight not for myself, but rather for Alexis who battled so bravely. The fight I have chosen is Alexis' journey. It has provided a purpose and direction beyond any I had previously. And so too will those who lost children in Newton find this passion. It is not something that happens overnight. The process of grief is just beginning and it will take a lifetime to unfold. That is part of the sad tragedy. It is a tragedy that will impact upon every fiber of each individual differently. The parents are now all bonded in this horrible fraternity of loss that from that day forward will shape their souls beyond any other event. We will not move on, and we will not get over our loss. We will however live life to the best of our ability, always putting one foot in front of the other in the endless march to create purpose. And so too will those who have recently suffered this loss. It is just beginning."

To others, coffee is essentially just another warm beverage enjoyed on a cold winter's day. In my life, coffee is a gift and a curse, a euphoric elixir and a nerve-bending brew. One day it will provide a burst of energy known only to superheroes, where other times it will shape-shift productive afternoons into unnecessarily anxiety-filled workdays. I know -- I should probably be sans-caffeine. But while I have my half-full extra large coffee in hand (only caffeine can make an optimist out of me), let us delve into this popular beverage and examine the evidence surrounding its health benefits and risks. The BasicsCaffeine, the main psycho-stimulant found in your morning's pot of java, is absorbed through your intestines and transported to your brain well within an hour of ingestion. The primary mechanism of action of caffeine is in its physical structure: It operates by mimicking another chemical called adenosine and thereby disrupts it's normal function in the brain.Adenosine acts like mercury in a thermometer, only it gauges brain cell energy rather than heat. Adenosine levels in your central nervous system rise through the day as your cells use up energy and declines during sleep as your brain recharges. [1]Thus, large adenosine concentrations built up in the brain indirectly contribute to that hangdog, droopy-eyed look we all know and love after a long day at work. So caffeine, acting as an adenosine mimicker, acts to block adenosine by clogging up adenosine receptors in the brain. What happens next? The brain, falsely sensing low levels of adenosine, gets duped into thinking it should continue expending cellular energy rather than conserving it. This biochemical beguilement results in the feeling of vigor rather than the appropriate physiologic sensation of fatigue. Sounds like a damn good drug to me. And much of the research behind caffeine agrees.Why You Should Embrace The BeanCaffeinated beverages such as your morning cup o' joe have been associated with a wide array of beneficial effects on the human body:Alertness -- A strong cup of coffee can raise alertness and reduce the sensation of fatigue. This may be especially important in certain populations such as night-shift workers, jet-lagged travelers, and individuals suffering from ADHD. [2][3] Headache -- This one is tricky. Caffeine, in combination with Tylenol or aspirin, has been demonstrated to relieve tension and migraine headaches. [4] However, be wary of self-medicating your pounding noggin with newly-concocted intravenous triple-shot espressos; studies have also linked caffeine intake with ""rebound"" headaches. [5] These headaches are produced when you lay off the good stuff only after your brain adapts to the effects of caffeine. Diseases of the Brain -- Drinking a few cups of coffee a day may have surprising (but moderate) protective properties against debilitating and progressive neurologic conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. [6][7] Although this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the studied benefits of coffee, it goes to show that ordering your daily cappa-mocha-latte may do more for you than just complement your oversized wayfarer shades and meticulously-cuffed skinny jeans. (I oddly envision the majority of my readers in this get up.) Whether you identify as the extremely well-read neo-hipster described above or not, beware of placing coffee on a potable pedestal just yet. Why You Should Stick To DecafCaffeinated beverages are not for everyone. Here's why:Psychiatric Conditions -- Individuals sensitive to caffeine may experience a variety of psychiatric side effects when drinking even a small quantity of coffee. Anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and even panic attacks are associated with coffee intake. These symptoms may be due to an exacerbation of a concomitant psychiatric condition or may be due to a deficiency in adequately breaking down the drug to its non-effective form in your liver. [8] Regardless of the etiology, if you are considered to have Woody Allen-esque qualities or are just straight up unstable, you should probably hold the caffeine. Heart Conditions -- For those coffee-naïve readers, beware of chasing the caffeine dragon if you suffer from hypertension (high blood pressure). Periodic coffee consumption has been shown to transiently increase blood pressure, which theoretically can put patients at an increased risk of cardiovascular events (stroke, heart attack). [9] Dependence -- Remember that McDonald's commercial about the guy who wouldn't talk to anyone without his coffee? (Check it out here for a refresher.) Two lessons to learn: 1) No one likes people like that. Fact. And 2) If you reach that level of caffeine dependence, you have reached the end of your coffee career. Like many controlled substances, one should self-monitor caffeine intake, as caffeine may lead to abuse, tolerance, and dependence. [10]Take-Home PointCoffee is amazing. But like any drug, its caffeine content may carry side effects that outweigh the benefits of consumption. Be smart and take time to understand the health consequences of caffeinated beverages and come to your own conclusions. In the meantime, I'll continue to tremulously troll the Web, awaiting the pending coffee crash that I alone will have to endure.For more by Brian Secemsky, M.D., click here.For more on personal health, click here."

Ask them what they already knowBe sure to start by asking your child what they have already heard or think they know about the tragedy. You want to dispel any rumors or exaggerations they might have heard.2. Make sure they know the children and teachers did not do anything wrongAs children are often taught that people are punished for bad deeds, it is important to speak to children about the incident as something that a very sick person did, not as a punishment.3. Keep habits the same Bonnie Peters, a licensed clinical social worker quoted in the Salt Lake Tribune, advises parents to help young kids feel safe by solidifying the family routine. ""Let kids know what their plans are for daily routines. Parents need to let children know they know what time they're going to school and getting home; that they know their teachers; and that those teachers are looking out for any strangers, so everyone is working to make school a safe place,"" Peters said.4. Let them know they are safe both at school and at homeExplain to children that they are safe in their school and home and that is why schools have fire and emergency drills so everyone can be prepared.5. Let them ask as many questions as possibleIt is important to keep the conversation open and let them come to you to ask questions whenever they have them.6. Don't leave the news onOnce you have discussed the tragedy, try to keep it off TV's and the computer. This only makes them more alarmed.You also might want to consider offering a prayer to the Newtown community with your child."

Though we find ourselves overwhelmed with emotion and feeling ill-equipped to process these incomprehensible events ourselves, let alone convey them to our children, we, as parents are in a unique position to guide our children in dark moments to a place of resilience and safety rather than to a place of fear.We may, in our own distress and sense of helplessness, feel like we can regain control by telling our children exactly what occurred and making sure they know what to do if the unthinkable happened and they were faced with an attack. Feeling that somehow warning them would prepare them. But there is a time and place for everything. This is not their job, nor should it be our priority. Certainly not now. In fact, our urgency to explain everything-- to quell our own fears-- will be confusing to children. They will be overloaded with information which will add to their stress. Resist that urge. Fear doesn't make us feel safer. First and foremost, our priority is to help our children feel loved and safe, to spend time with them, be aware and attentive to their needs and keep their lives and routines as regular as possible. When talking with our children about tragedy, we can choose to emphasize grief and healing rather than fear and danger. Our purpose is to help our children recover and be resilient, not to be frightened of their lives. Though our emotions may make us feel angry and scared that violence is the norm lurking around every corner, we know in our heads and our hearts that billions of people want a safe, peaceful world and that we are joined together in grieving for the terrible events which occurred. Here are several ideas to guide you in talking about Friday's school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut; these suggestions can be useful in general when helping your child through traumatic events.Turn off the news Parents are the best source of news for their children. News programs are not geared for children and repeated exposure to distressing information or images can be confusing and in some cases traumatizing to children when they believe that with each repetition they see, the event is recurring. Don't give details Children don't need to know details. Unless they ask, this is not important information. They need to have a narrative to understand the basics of what occurred. Emphasize that many people are working to make sure that doesn't happen again, and that it is over. Start with what your child already knows Ask your child what they've heard of what happened. Young children do not need to know unless they will be exposed to the information at church or synagogue or some other venue. The following script can be used for children in middle school. High school students will likely have more questions. Listen to their questions, ask for their input and share yours at a level appropriate for your child.Here is a sample script: A very sad thing happened in a town in Connecticut on Friday. A man who was very disturbed and had a lot of problems came to a school and shot people; 28 people died. This was very wrong. Immediately, police and ambulances came to keep people safe and take care of people who were hurt. The shooting stopped. The families are very sad. Many, many people who care and love them are helping to take care of them. Schools are very safe places. This is very rare, which means it is extremely unlikely to ever happen. Your teachers and principals work hard to keep you safe at school. That is their job and they work very hard to do that.Consider your purpose  We all want to protect our children. Although we can't always protect them from the fact that bad things do happen, we can protect them from feeling more vulnerable and scared because of our explanations. Our explanations should let children know that hard and bad things happen sometimes, but they are very rare, that billions of other people don't want those things to happen, just like them, and that there are thousands of people whose job is to keep children safe. These people work to prevent things from happening. Very rarely bad things do happen, and that is very sad. Maintain your routines When a tragedy occurs, the routines such as regular meals and bedtimes may get compromised. Change is stressful; routine is organizing. Routines signal to children that the adults are in charge, and that normalcy prevails. This lets them know that the tragedy, though it is being processed, is over and it's not still going on.Restore a sense of safety This is not a time to teach about what to do if an emergency occurred. Children are feeling vulnerable either from grasping what occurred during the tragic events, or even just from seeing the adults upset. The priority now is to tell children that they are safe, help them to picture the layers and layers of adults whose job it is to keep them safe: their parents, the mayor of their town, the president, their teachers and school personnel. Stay calm  Children are likely to see parents upset during this time, and crying and feeling sad are all normal, expected and healthy reactions to a tragedy. You can explain this to your child: ""Mom is very sad right now, because this was a very sad thing that happened. Mom is OK. Mom won't always feel this way, but this is how Mom feels right now."" It is very important in the presence of children to avoid angry outbursts and tirades against people you believe are responsible; this will be confusing and may even make children feel that they are somehow responsible for making you sad or angry.Give support and spend time with your children While this is an extremely emotional time for parents identifying with and grieving for the parents who have lost their children, or families who have lost loved ones, spending time with your children will help you and your children to feel connected and safe.Expect a range of reactions Children may cry when they hear the news, they may be angry or they may have little reaction. All of these are normal. Children may be more clingy, need more hugs and support at bedtime. All of this is normal.When to seek help If after a week or two children continue to be having difficulties, and their anxiety and fears have intensified over that time rather than faded and resolved, consult your pediatrician for advice.Though we can't shield our children from the realities of life, we can greatly impact how our children are exposed to them, what they learn from them, and how they live with them. These are the parental privileges and responsibilities that we can exercise even in difficult times. Our goal is to prevent our children from becoming afraid or angry or feeling like the world is a chaotic place; it is to show them that there is light even in the narrow places that we are thrust in from tragedies. We can know that while there are many issues which may divide us-- as parents, as educators, as those who care about the future for our children-- we must focus on what brings us together and with our conviction hold tight and work toward the possibility that things can be better for all."

And however you feel about the growing debate surrounding gun control, one consensus has come out of this tragedy, which is to hold your kids tightly.Appreciate the gift of life that is more fleeting that we can bear to admit.So when I woke up yesterday to a kitchen full of dirty dishes, a mountain of laundry to put away and living room full of cat hair choked furniture, I asked my younger son if he wanted to go on a day of downtown adventures. (My older son was sleeping, and my gift to him was to let him continue with his favorite hobby as long as he wanted. After I kissed him a couple dozen times, of course.)The chores could wait.We chose to take public transportation, as we both have free passes, plus it frees us from the shackles of having to stay close to our parked car. We stopped first at the local Einstein's Bagels to get a pumpkin latte to share, as well as a toasted and buttered jalapeño bagel for my son, which we did not.We stood in the rain and waited for the bus, and talked about nothing and everything and passed the overly sweet latte between the two of us. And I ached for all the Connecticut parents who had these future moments stolen from them.No shepherding a child into adulthood, no shared coffee drinks, no worries about high school grades that will determine college opportunities.My son and I wolfed down food cart falafel in the rain, browsed expensive European soccer magazines (him) and decor books (me) at Powell's bookstore; ogled the couches at West Elm and Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams (me) and hunted through the clothing at Buffalo Exchange (him.)We made a joint decision to check out the westside Goodwill and hailed another bus for the short yet uphill and wet journey. I picked up a few small things for my sister's birthday and my son lamented that all the new looking Vans shoes were either too small or bizarrely overpriced.The bus ride home ended with a long and chatty walk that included a detour through the holiday lighting of Peacock Lane and free slices of cake from a Walgreens grand opening. We were both good and tired by the time we staggered home, although I did load the dishwasher enough to run a single load. Our evening consisting of a couple of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes (me) and the newest Saturday Night Live (him.)No laundry, no chores, just me staring at my son and holding him tightly.And when my older son needed me to drive him far across town for a poker game, I did not whine about it. Even when he needed to picked up at 11:30 p.m.For today I have these kids, and I will hold them tightly."

How could they not? We've given them a lot of material, thanks to the Transportation Security Administration.Shelbi Walser, seventh-grade jihadist?Consider the case of Shelbi Walser, the Texas seventh-grader with a genetic bone disorder who was flying to Florida for medical treatment last week. TSA agents detained her at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, claiming she had ""bomb residue"" on her hands. After a 45-minute wait, agents simply let her go without conducting any further screening.What's so funny about it: Walser was obviously a scared little girl, not a junior suicide bomber. The punchline isn't that she was that a sick child in a wheelchair was held by the TSA, but that the agents just let her roll on to the terminal without testing her wheelchair, which Walser later confessed had probably come into contact with fertilizer. What's laughable is that millions of Americans now believe that somewhere in a Yemeni warehouse, giddy terrorists are building their latest weapon: an exploding wheelchair. That's so 1990s.Andy Ramirez covets your iPadYou've probably seen this video of TSA screener Andy Ramirez, who is accused of swiping an iPad at Orlando International Airport. The device was left in the terminal by ABC News, and a few days later, it came calling for the iPad with a camera crew. Ramirez hemmed and hawed before handing over the tablet computer, which had been tracked to his house. He's been fired.What's so funny about it: TSA agents taking iPads from passengers is only funny in the sense that it's ironic -- the very people who are supposed to be protecting us are stealing from us. What's leaving the terrorists in stitches is the fact that Ramirez apparently didn't know iPads can be tracked. And he's supposed to be screening passengers for weapons and explosives? Hilarious.Cancer patients could be hijackersMichelle Dunaj is dying of leukemia. The Michigan woman wanted to make one final trip to Hawaii, but the TSA screeners in Seattle had a few questions for her before she boarded her flight to the islands. Like, what's with all those prescription drugs you're carrying? What are these saline bags? Oops, did we just break one? Sorry. And could you please lift your shirt in public so we can get a closer look at the feeding tubes? What's so funny about it: The terrorists aren't laughing at Dunaj. After all, they probably know a thing or two about pain and suffering. No, it's the fact that she's become the poster girl for TSA harassment. Going after a cancer patient is a new low, even for the bad guys, and despite it all, the TSA still hasn't caught a single terrorist. Not one. The radical Islamists who attacked the United States on 9/11 didn't just succeed in bringing down a few planes and buildings. They made an entire country overreact, say critics, and America willingly sacrificed some of its most fundamental constitutional rights in order to have the illusion of safety. Observers now believe we've created an overfunded, ineffective federal agency called the TSA that harasses children and terminally ill passengers and steals from travelers.We can do better. The TSA needs to slim down, get smarter about how it screens passengers, and stop the airport theatrics, as many experts have already suggested. Indeed, as I have also suggested on my consumer advocacy site.Today's TSA is a joke. Unfortunately, the only ones laughing are the terrorists."

(AP Photo/Jason DeCrow)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca0f01f00005000214c86.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In nearly 12 full years of writing blog posts, I have chosen to write about current events twice. The first time was on September 11, 2001. The second is today.The tragic killings at Sandy Hook elementary last Friday have the potential to make the world a better place, because they raise important questions into our personal and global consciousness. How we respond to these questions -- personally, in our families, and as a global community -- will depend almost entirely on how deeply we are willing to look inside ourselves for new answers.How do we balance our personal safety and freedom with the safety and freedom of the society in which we live? How do we respond when death strikes close to home and when fear and anger fill our minds and hearts? And perhaps most important of all, how do we deal with the full, unfettered possibility of life, which will always include the expected and the unexpected, the tragic and the comic, things we want to happen and things we would do everything in our power to prevent if only we could?While I lay no claim to the ""correct"" answers, I do believe I can point to where the best answers will come from. Perhaps more significantly, I think I can point to a more important question, one that we each face each and every moment of each and every day:Which thoughts that come to mind will we act upon, and which thoughts do we let pass through to make space for something new?I do not know if every parent who heard about these shootings spent time thinking ""What if that were my child?"" -- but I did, and my wife did, and every parent I've spoken with and heard from did. And because the nature of thought is that we feel what we think, we have all been touched by a sense of sadness and loss, by fear for what might have been and what might be yet to come, by compassion for those that did lose their children that day, by a deep gratitude for our own children and a desire to hold them close and never let them go.If we were victims of our own thinking, we would be doomed to walk around at the mercy of those thoughts, living in fear and confusion and anger and despair. It would feel like because we were angry and scared something had to be done, something to strike back at the apparent source of our fear and anger.If we thought that source was outside us, we might write angry letters to Congress or on Facebook attempting to ban guns, or we might band together with other concerned parents and arm ourselves in the hopes of out-gunning the lone gunmen who could one day take away our own loved ones.If we were sufficiently lost in the whirlwind of our own thinking, we might even stop seeing the people who disagreed with us as a part of our human family and begin to see them as either ""them"" or ""us"" -- on the side of good or on the side of evil.When we forget that even the worst thought imaginable is only real in our imagination, the world can look like a very frightening place. And when our thinking has gotten us to the point where the noise in our head is so loud that we can't even hear ourselves think, we are capable of doing things so horrible that we would never, ever consider them in our saner, calmer moments. Fortunately, we do not have to become victims of our own thinking. Thought has the power to create any possibility, but it does not have the power to bring any possibility into being. Only we can do that when we speak a thought into being and act it into the world. By themselves, our thoughts are majestically impotent, filled with sound and fury, signifying nothing. It only takes a moment of quiet to take away a lifetime of noise. One pause in the onslaught of thoughts and their accompanying anger and fear allows our innate wisdom back in, like the sun piercing the clouds in an artistic representation of God. We can have a change of heart in any moment. We can look beyond the noise of thought and feeling and see something new, and in a moment of insight our old ideas are wiped away like writing erased from a chalkboard.As a society, this is how we will resolve the seeming paradoxes of individual and community safety. As parents, this is how we will learn to cope with wanting to keep our children close and to watch them grow wings and fly free. As individuals, this is how we will learn to live with both the inevitability of death and the infinite possibility of life. What happened in Sandy Hook did not have to happen, but it did. We cannot go back and prevent it, but we can look forward and prevent something similar from happening again. We won't do it by entrenching ourselves deeper in our current thinking, looking for better and better arguments as to why our solution is right and their solution is wrong. We won't do it by drowning in our feelings of hopelessness an despair, no matter how real and overwhelming those feelings will be while we're in them.""How could a loving God allow this to happen?"" is a question that has plagued those that believe and those that want to believe throughout time. No matter how hard we pray, it seems that we cannot prevent violence through faith alone. For me, I have found my comfort inside the paradox of God in the words of Marianne Williamson:""God heard us. He sent help. He sent you.""The future will change one person at a time and one thought at a time. You can't bring back a child, but you can bring back the hope in one. You can show love to those that have been raised in hate and you can be an oasis of kindness in a desert of cruelty. You can learn more about the nature of thought and feeling, and the deeper wisdom that guides us when we allow ourselves to keep our heart open, even when it feels like it will break into a million pieces.What breaks is never our heart -- it is the shell that has formed around it. And when that shell breaks open, our hearts unite with the hearts of others and we learn at another level what it is to love and be loved.Above all, the next time you see a young person who seems lost and confused and is trying to find their way, don't ignore them and don't turn away. Without your light, it will be that much harder for them to find their way back home.With all my love and deepest compassion, michaelFor more by Michael Neill, click here.For more on wisdom, click here."

The answer cannot be what gun activists are pouring forth online: Arm the kindergarten teachers. And then what? Train them in moving target practice?

Republican members of Congress insist on the urgent need to cut ""entitlement programs"" like Medicaid, continuing the rhetoric that pits ""small business owners and middle class taxpayers"" against ""people who want to mooch off of the government and not pay taxes.""But who exactly are the entitled moochers who benefit from Medicaid? In fact, half of the Americans covered by Medicaid are children -- and one who is especially close to my heart is my 4-year-old son, Isaac.Isaac was born at 28 weeks. That's 12 weeks early. He spent the first eight weeks of his life in the neonatal intensive care unit.As a micro-preemie weighing only 2 pounds 5 ounces, Isaac was at risk for many, many life-threatening challenges. We were lucky, though, that he seemed to dodge bullet after bullet.However, when he was five-and-half-months old, he caught a cold and abruptly stopped breathing. After receiving chest compressions and being intubated in the pediatric intensive care unit, it was determined that he had a malformation of the trachea. Isaac received a tracheostomy (a tube in his neck so that he could breathe) when he was six months old.After a month in the hospital, we were allowed to take him home, but only with private duty nursing and enough medical equipment to turn our home into a mini-hospital. Eighteen months later, he underwent surgery to reconstruct his trachea. As a result, he is now a fairly typical 4-year-old, but the permanent damage to his lungs means that, when sick, he can sometimes require oxygen and always needs close monitoring, whether at home or the hospital.Our insurance -- along with Medicaid (through a waiver program for medically fragile children) -- allowed us to have Isaac at home, with nursing care for those eighteen months he was trached. Without specialized, home-based medical equipment and this in-home nursing care, my husband and I would have not been able leave the house. Isaac was too fragile for typical childcare. Once our private insurance capped out and stopped providing benefits for medical supplies and nursing, Medicaid took over. This coverage allowed my husband and I to work and to pay taxes... to be productive contributors to the nation's economy.My family's story about Medicaid shows how keeping Medicaid strong is not only morally the right thing to do, but also an effective way to keep families on solid economic footing. One bill from a particularly bad day in the pediatric intensive care unit came to $142,000. That's not an expense Joe Blow Small Business Owner can afford, even if he gets all the tax breaks in the history of tax breaks. It's not an expense a middle class family can afford, either, even with savings accounts and retirement accounts to plunder. A strong Medicaid program makes fiscal sense for our country as a whole. Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program ensure that one-third of our nation's children have access to the preventive care they need. This preventative care can address health problems early before they develop into expensive health crises. Uninsured children are 5 times more likely than insured children to use the emergency room as a regular source of care. Why? Because they are left with no other choice. Cutting programs like Medicaid won't make health care costs magically disappear; it just shifts the costs to states. And states, like my state of Texas, simply can't afford to pick up the costs of lost federal funds if Medicaid is cut. Right now, Medicaid is structured so that the federal government automatically helps states to cover additional health care costs when needed, like during a recession, natural disaster, or health care crisis.There are more financially sound ways to solve our fiscal woes -- ways that don't require throwing children's health benefits off a cliff. Defense experts such as Lawrence Korb, who served as assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration, believe there is plenty of room to make cuts to defense spending. And in terms of federal spending that stimulates the economy, healthcare spending creates more jobs than defense spending. And what about raising more revenue? Close tax loopholes for corporations and raise the historically low tax rates for the wealthy.When people insist that we have to cut Medicaid in order to solve our budget problems, I ask them to take a hard look at their own family budgets.Do you have enough in your savings account to pay $142,000 for a stay in the intensive care unit? Multiply that amount by two, by five, by ten. Can your assets support that kind of money? Even if they can't cover that kind of money, will your assets still preclude you from qualifying for Medicaid? What would you do? Would you have to go bankrupt before you could get medical coverage? This would have happened to my family had it not been for a Medicaid waiver program for chronically ill children.

The residents of an idyllic Connecticut town were reeling in horror from the massacre of 20 small children and six adults in one of the worst school shootings in US history. The heavily armed gunman shot dead 18 children inside Sandy Hook Elementary School, said Connecticut State Police spokesman Lieutenant Paul Vance. Two more died of their wounds in hospital.

We search for clues that would make this horrific act understandable, and we do not find them. We do know that whatever was going on in the mind of 20-year-old Adam Lanza when he went on this appalling shooting spree, it did not come from a place of good mental health. But to blame this violence on Asperger's or a personality disorder, as many media outlets currently are, is a serious mistake.At this point, any comment on the psychiatric profile of Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old man responsible for these murders, is complete hearsay. We don't know whether he had a history of psychiatric illness or if had been exhibiting signs of a psychotic breakdown. Unfortunately, that hasn't stopped extensive speculation that Lanza had Asperger's disorder, or a personality disorder, and even obsessive-compulsive disorder. Much has been made of the reports that Lanza was a smart but quiet kid who carried a briefcase to class instead of a backpack and felt at home with computers, perhaps more so than with his peers. By themselves these traits do not indicate any diagnosis at all, although we have been quick to dissect them in the search for meaning. These amateur diagnoses based on unconfirmed information are very harmful. To my mind perhaps the worst is the suggestion that the unimaginable nature of this violence -- the fact that children were targeted -- somehow indicates a lack of empathy that can be associated with autism spectrum disorders. This is completely untrue. Individuals on the spectrum are in no way predisposed to this kind of violent behavior. Ample research proves otherwise. And while individuals with autism may be less adept at picking up nonverbal social cues, they are just as capable of experiencing emotional empathy as anyone else. I have known many autistic children who would be crushed knowing that a sibling, a parent, or even a spider was suffering. Trading in rumors and misinformation sensationalizes real disorders and leads to stereotypes and bigotry. It fuels the stigma that mental disorders are dangerous or scandalous and prevents people from seeking the life-changing help they need. And because untreated psychiatric disorders are more likely to result in violence, it makes tragedies like this one more likely to happen again. So let's stop speculating about the things we don't know and start focusing on what we do know. We know that when we see someone suffering, we shouldn't look away. And when we see young people coughing, wheezing or bleeding, we insist that they get attention. But when we see young people with disturbing behavior, or young people in clear emotional distress, we ignore them and hope these problems will go away. The first signs of 75 percent of all psychiatric disorders appear by the age of 24. We need to be on the lookout for signs of distress in young people to get them help as soon as possible. Research shows that early intervention improves the outlook for anyone with a psychiatric disorder -- and drastically reduces the likelihood of violence. As a nation, we need to change our attitude about mental illness. We need a better plan for giving mental health care parity with other medical care. Improving access to the best evidence-based interventions should be a national priority. The economic cost as well as the human cost of untreated mental illness makes that clear. Finally, we know our first graders should never fear for their lives when they sit down in a classroom. We know we need to do everything we can to make sure this never happens again.Harold S.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" -- Dylan ThomasNumb. Heartbroken. Speechless. Angry. That is how most of us felt when we heard the shocking and so very ""surreal"" news about the tragic, senseless deaths of 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. How many of us shook our heads in utter disbelief when we heard that 20 innocent children, 6 and 7 years old, lost their precious young lives, along with six adults, some who died trying to save them?The overwhelming reaction to this evil nightmare is that gun control must be addressed once and for all. How many more lives need to be lost before we realize the havoc guns are wreaking? If the massacre of 20 innocent elementary school children doesn't finally change the gun laws, stopping the ongoing insanity we have been witnessing far too frequently lately, including the shootings in Colorado, Wisconsin and Oregon, then we will become a society behaving like animals, not civilized people anymore.When we reach a point where our humanity is in question, and killing becomes a common part of our reality, we run the risk of becoming numb to what is acceptable and normal. Yes, we can identify evil when we see it, such as what happened to those 20 school children, sitting in a classroom learning what each of us were fortunate to learn when we were that young because we weren't killed by someone possessing evil personified -- but evil is something entirely different now, and we must see if for what it has become.It came to a little town that has never experienced anything remotely sinister before, except for one homicide in the past 10 years. This is a community that functions like we are meant to. It represents everything that is good and pure and healthy, but on that tragic, almost ineffable morning, something happened not only to them, but to all of us. It let us know that normal isn't normal anymore. This new type of normal is dark, very dark, and we, all of us, must find the light in the darkness again.Let's come together and rage against the ""dying of the light."" Let's say ""enough"" and mean it. Let our voices be heard loudly and not give up shouting ""stop"" until it does. Let's not be afraid to look darkness in the face and say, ""You must end, or we will die with you.""When something as heinous happens as what happened to those 20 angels when they were here on Earth, far too brief that they were, we must come together and speak for them as a united voice and say what they would if we could hear their little voices. What do you think they would they tell us? ""Hurting one another is bad. Please make it stop?""Each of us can light a candle and stand up to darkness. Let's be a community that extends larger than Newtown. We are all connected beyond the boundaries of our cities or towns and can make a difference together.

U.S. airlines are spending nearly $2 billion to upgrade long-neglected lounges and aircraft. Their most-prized customers are getting new seats that turn into beds, large flat-screen TVs and savory food and wine. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca0bd24000032005345fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let's face it: Once you have a taste of business and first class, it's tough to go back. But, unless your employer is picking up the tab, who can really afford to shell out the $15K for a private suite on Emirates? If you can, keep it to yourself. With banks capping cash bonuses at amounts that wouldn't pay for one Swedish nanny, much less two for the banker with no kids, times have changed. And when times get tough, it's time to get creative. There is a difference between a domestic and an international upgrade. The good news is that for domestic flights within the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, you're more likely to get upgraded if you have airline status. Also, airlines will sometimes offer an upgrade purchase option for $100 or so at the airport if first class has empty seats. For some airlines like Delta, members with elite status automatically receive unlimited, complimentary, domestic upgrades when they're available. That also includes a travel companion, so if you don't have status, fly with someone who does. And just every once in a rare while, the gate agent will even upgrade commoners, with no status at all. International flight upgrades are a completely different story. It's in these situations that the airline Scrooge comes out. It costs them money to put fliers in first class, which means there's little generosity in an industry where margins are razor thin. Thus, it's rare that just your pretty face will get you an upgrade at the airport for an international flight. For those who claim that dressing up for business and first class will work? It doesn't hurt, but 99.9 percent of the time, it won't help either. The glass-half-full news is that you may already have the tools you need to work the system, including your credit card points, frequent flyer miles and airline status. If a flight isn't oversold (more on that later), then you'll need to do some pre-planning, at least seven days in advance to insure your first class seat. Prices skyrocket within seven days of departure, because airlines capitalize on companies that have no choice but to send their worker bees on a last-minute trip. You definitely don't want to compete in this arena if you're looking to economically get into first and business class. Here are a few of our inside techniques: When you buy your fare matters. Generally, the airlines re-price and run sales on Tuesdays, so by 3 p.m. or so, you'll find the best prices available until about Thursday. This is prime time to shop and book your fares. The most expensive times to book your fares are on the weekends, so avoid that danger zone. Buy an upgradable coach ticket. Certain Coach fares will allow you to use your miles and upgrade certificates to upgrade to first class. In some instances, the pricing is not egregiously more than buying a regular coach ticket, and it's mostly less expensive than buying first class outright. Upgrade one-way only. On long-haul flights with major time differences between destinations, being able to rest comfortably sets the tone for your trip. If buying first class or a round-trip upgradable ticket is too rich for your blood, look into a one-way upgradable fare. Sometimes just a few hundred dollars more will get you to first class, one way. It's better than nothing, and often worth it when you're flying out so you arrive fresh and new. And, it's much more palatable to fly at the back of the bus on the way home when you're still on a vacation high and have photos to get you through the long flight. Ask for a discounted business/first class ticket. Airline prices have gone up over the past two years because of fuel costs and fewer flights, but sometimes you can get a discounted business/first class ticket for around $2,100 to destinations like Milan or London. Half the challenge is knowing to ask for the discounted ticket, because the oh-so-helpful ticket agents don't always offer it. Pay with points. Check with your credit card on options that will allow you to pay for a ticket with your credit card points. For example, when you book with American Express, you have the option to pay for all or part of your ticket with points. Combined with buying the upgradable fare or the discounted business/first class ticket, and you may end up paying the same price as a coach ticket. Even better, if you rack up lots of credit card miles from work and personal expenses, this ticket may be gratis. Pay with mileage. Yes, it is often 250,000 miles or more for a first class ticket. But once again, there's a loophole. If you're willing to have a stopover (or two) and your dates are flexible, the 100,000-mile first class ticket does exist. Don't try to book this type of award ticket online. Call the airline and settle in for at least 45 minutes as you make them price out the best options for you. Nothing that's good comes easy, a philosophy that applies to getting the best price on your first class seat. If you're rolling the dice and hoping to get upgraded on the day of your international flight, your best chance is at the gate, where they have discretion. This fairy godmother moment usually only happens when the flight is oversold. This is the time to turn on that charm. Technically those upgrades go to those with airline status first, but it doesn't hurt to ask nicely to be put on the wait list. The stairway to first class can be treacherous, but it's well worth working the system for those long flights."

How do you find life in the midst of carnage too horrible to imagine? While the governor of Connecticut suggested that his state would ""get through"" the killing spree, which took the lives of 20 small children and seven adults (including the shooter), there is an even more important point that must not be missed. In all due respect, it is not the government that is left at the grave site and afterward; it is the individual, the mommy, the daddy, the sister and brother, the grandmother and grandpa, the aunts and uncles, and this doesn't even begin to name the friends. When our babies are taken from us through acts of violence, it inflicts upon the survivors a particular kind of suffering for which there are no words. And, just as true, the trauma runs so deep, that those of us who know the mourners can find ourselves awkward, hesitant, fearful that, despite our well-meaning attempt to comfort, our words and actions might ""make it worse.""Here's what you need to know, from the perspective of a parent who has lost their child from a catastrophic act of violence. Having been through it myself some decades ago, allow me to share what might be useful, a GPS for heart and soul during these tragic times:1. You cannot make it worse. I promise. The worst has already happened. Your love can only make it better. Community counts. Outreach bridges the pain.2. You need not be profound. What bereft parents need, more than anything, is ""real."" Forget clever sayings. Forget saying things like ""Johnny or Susie is in a better place."" This is not comforting. 3. Stay focused on what matters. What matters is that the family is left with the empty chair, the empty bed where their child so recently was. What comforts is acknowledgement of this. Telling the truth with a focused statement, such as ""I cannot imagine what you must be going through,"" makes you trustworthy. No one will ever fill the empty chair or replace the lost.4. Keep it simple. It is more than enough to say: ""There are no words."" An authentic outreach, with words like these, means the world.5. Do NOT tell your story. This is not the time. Forget about the temptation to tell about the time Aunt Tilly died, or Uncle Ralph. Each death is different and deserves its focus. There is no way we can appreciate the particulars for our friend in grief. We are not they.6. Be a safe place ""to land,"" when the casseroles and cards stop coming. Parents and families who grieve the loss of their child have had their entire lives change in a heartbeat. Nothing will ever be the same. Be the one who offers to meet for a coffee or cup of tea, just to listen. What you hear is far more important than what you say. Traumatic loss is especially complicated. The imagery of the details runs again and again through the mind and takes a long, long time to ease. Be patient. PTSD does not even begin to cover what the bereaved confront.7. Be the one who remembers. Record the date and year of the death and birthday. Record the child's whole name and birth date. Remember these dates and honor them in the coming years. Believe me: Very, very few people will remember. Be the one who refuses to forget, and thereby be the one to honor the fact that this child once lived and shall always live in the family heart. One of my dearest friends pointed out to me such a remembrance: The first Christmas after my son was gone, Janie put an ornament on her tree for Matt. Inside a blue satin tiny box, she placed his graduation card. She has placed that box on her tree for the past 21 years. Sixteen years later when their oldest son died suddenly, I found a pewter angel, put Ted's name on it, for our tree. Friendship is a mutual exchange. We do not have to ""climb into the grave"" to remember, but can grow through the grief with clear and good intention.8. Be there for the duration. Remember birthdays, death dates and holidays. All that you need to do is let your friend know that you are thinking of them on this particular day and sending love. This is plenty.For those of you who do not personally know the family, or the child who died, but would like to make a difference, consider the following, and follow your own instinct:1. Turn off the repeated, recycled coverage in the news. You've heard the story. Time to get into mindfulness. Turn within. Listen to your heart. Pay special attention to children around you. Offer creative materials for them to express themselves when they are small, if they are aware of what has transpired. 2. Tune into some act of kindness you might like to do in the name of the child.3. Do this act without needing recognition or credit.4. Write down the names of the children lost, so the awareness is specific. Make a memorial through some simple act of beauty. If you have a holiday tree, perhaps a simple ornament in their name. If you do not, perhaps hanging seeds for the birds in winter. Enter life shared more deeply with all sentient beings.5. If it seems right, contact the parents in time, and let them know your heart is with them, even though you have not met.6. Refrain from making suggestions. Unless you have been through this yourself, a suggestion may seem insensitive.7. Consider getting involved in whatever cause you believe would promote the well-being of other children in the name of the child/children who died.8. Love a child today. Become a guardian of the good. Notice children around and appreciate what is special. Celebrate the moment of that child's well being.   9. Thank a parent today for the gift of their child in the world.10. Leave fear of self-consciousness, uncertainty, and your vulnerability at the door. Risk love, praise, and gratitude for what you have been given.11. Send love to every parent and every child you see in silence.12. Cultivate gratitude for life. Become its steward.Love letter to you, the parent, who have lost your child so tragically:I remember. I remember you. I remember your child. Although we have never met, I have met such a time. And how vividly I recall the shock, the disbelief, the numbing, the reaction that this could not have happened to your baby. How hard, if not impossible, right now to take in the enormity of what has happened. In fact, it is not possible to take in what has changed everything for you, for your family, for your child. Who could have imagined, when you awoke this morning, that such an earthquake would crack open your heart? That last moment when you saw your child alive, who could have predicted it would be the last? If we could have known, oh so many things we might have said, might have done, the other sorts of choices we might have made.But we did not know at the time. And that is the point. You did your best. Sure, there may have been so many other things on your mind as you said goodbye, but one thing is certain, and your child, deep down, knew it. You loved your child. Still do. Your child knew they were loved, as well.No one can give meaning to such a terrible act of violence that ended your baby's life. No one can, because such a thing lacks all apparent meaning. The trick is to find a way to navigate what seems impossible. I will not insult you with a lie. There are hard, hard times ahead. There will be days and nights that you will lose your bearings, and days when it seems unimaginable to make it through the hours when your heart is broken and you feel that terrible emptiness.But, what I want you to know, as well, is that through the crack in the cosmos, which has broken your heart, new life will come again, in completely different ways. If you wish, an awareness will come that may help you deepen your appreciation for what you have had through your child and what you can offer as a testimonial and memorial to the gift of your child's life here on Earth.Most of all, please remember you are not alone. You are now traveling the path my African friends call ""The Land of the Gray Cloud."" Love is with you. All the tears swallowed, and those bravely shed are a testimonial to this fact. Love is making itself known to us, the bereaved, as never before. Peace be with you.Be the love you wished for your child,CaraYour Turn: What would you like to express to the bereaved of these children and adults just lost in our country this day? Remember, the adults who were killed were somebody's ""baby,"" too, somebody's mommy or daddy or kin. I'm listening!

What would make a person do such a horrible thing? The easiest fallback is to say the person must be mentally ill. In the case of Adam Lanza, we know almost nothing at all about his mental health history -- whether he saw a psychiatrist, was diagnosed, had taken medication, was pursuing psychotherapy. Yet I almost immediately saw Tweets saying that gun laws for people with mental illnesses have to change. Personally, I'd be happy to throw out all the guns and be done with it. I hate guns. But I also hate imprecision, and this idea of lumping people together -- particularly when we're talking about disenfranchising them -- doesn't sit right. Let's define our terms. Right now, the American Psychiatric Association is putting its finishing touches on what's known (rather fatuously) as ""the bible"" of mental health care: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Grey's Anatomy of the addled mind. When we say Adam Lanza had a mental illness, are we simply saying he's in there somewhere -- along with depressives and compulsive gamblers and The United States of Tara -- and that all the diagnosed and diagnosable are the same? Or are we saying he had a particular type of mental illness? If so, which is the one that causes mass murder?Learning a person's diagnosis -- or learning that he doesn't have one -- won't help explain anything at all. I'll tell you this -- since I started seeing psychiatrists in 1991, I have been given the following diagnoses: bipolar disorder, dissociative disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, schizoaffective disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, seasonal affective disorder, major depressive disorder and premenstrual dysmorphic disorder. Not one of those labels told my doctors anything about my capacity to commit violence (which is nil, unless it's to my iPhone, apparently). If it turns out Adam Lanza is bipolar and I'm bipolar, does the bipolar explain his violence? Or does it explain my passivity? The labels are useful up to a point -- but they're hopeless in moments like these when the scope of the behavior is so far beyond the norm. What use is a normal framework in such aberrant circumstances?What interests me is not Lanza's diagnosis but the way in which he -- as well as the mall shooter in Oregon -- hid his true self so completely. We are all so shocked when someone is able to hide himself so carefully, tuck himself away -- ""I would never have guessed,"" we say. But aren't we all hiding things? Don't we all have secrets that we don't tell each day? I have hidden some enormous things from people I loved, from people I saw every day. I hid an affair from my husband -- for months. I hid a pregnancy and then hid my abortion. I hid an addiction -- or two. I hid the fact that I had a major illness. I hid a hearing problem.How many times do you hear a friend or family member say, ""I didn't want to tell him that..."" Or: ""I just acted like I..."" Or: ""It was just a white lie..."" Yet we're always so shocked by other people's secrets. As if we're the only ones built for shame.For more by Liz Spikol, click here.For more on mental health, click here."

I am the mother of four children ages 6, 8, 9, and 16. I somehow felt like I needed to understand what had happened before I could talk to them about the tragedy. But how does one understand the incomprehensible? In desperation I sat down and sent a frustrated email to two of my most brilliant friends, who just happen to be environmental psychologists, demanding answers. I wanted to know, what it is in our environment that is making these horrific scenes so frequent. I thought I knew the easy ""answers"": increased violence in the media, increased access to more effective guns, desire for fame in the Twitterverse. I'm not denying that these are present factors, but they're obviously not the whole story, and the relevance of the first one, to my mind, is shaky at best. I understand that this was a disturbed young man. Still, we've had disturbed people in our midst since we've had a midst, and this type of act seems new. Why is it so often schools? Why is it so often young victims and perpetrators? Is there something in our environment that is driving already borderline personalities over the edge? Predictably, sagaciously, my dear friend wrote back that I was demanding rational answers for an irrational act. Each of these tragedies is unique. The motivations of the perpetrators may help us to cope, but they won't necessarily help up to prevent the next act. After praying that they hadn't already seen the stories on a random news source or heard about it from a friend, I decided to talk to my kids about the shooting. It was very difficult. I said exactly what a good mother should -- that they would always be safe, and that this could never happen at their school, and that this was a one crazy person. I knew I was lying to them. The fact is, of course, I know that I take a calculated risk every day I send them off. I didn't like lying to them, and I know that one day when they realize that I can't always keep them safe they will resent me for it, but, talking to scared young kids using qualifiers is obviously a non-starter. I did what I imagine all the rest of the concerned parents in this country did. I hugged them much tighter, I was/am desperately sad for the families in Connecticut and exceedingly grateful that it was not my children who were harmed, and I lied to my kids. Again my friend weighed in with words of wisdom far beyond my own:Yes, you lie to your children. Every parent does... Every spouse lies to their partners. We reassure when there are no grounds for being reassuring; we express confidence where we have little. We would like to believe that we can manufacture safe and productive lives for those we love, when in fact we struggle every day to manufacture a safe and productive life for ourselves. And we lie to ourselves, too. ""If I do X, then Y will happen."" ... We play the odds and pretend they're certainties.But what choice do we have? Obviously, I will continue to send my children out into the world, because life inside a protective bubble is no life at all."

There is much more to the local cuisine than Peking duck and dim sum. Hong Kong's international restaurants are innovative, particularly in Central and Causeway Bay, and fight to bring in top chefs, mixologists and designers. In this travel video, I eat my way through six of my favorite restaurants and bars. Warning: the food close-ups might excite your appetite...Caffe HabituIn this frantic city, Caffe Habitu is an oasis. The boutique space is ideal for meeting friends or working (hooray for high-speed, unlimited Wi-Fi). While unfussy, the Italian-style dishes are made with quality ingredients. I'm a fan of the caviar eggs benedict, creamy pasta carbonara and chocolate lava cake with pear. The imported coffee gets a cute twist: lattes are decorated to look like a teddy bear's face! Habitu has multiple locations; the Lan Kwai Fong branch is the only one with coffee cocktails. (Room 101, Tak Woo House, 1 Wo On Lane, Central)The Academics At this sister cafe to Habitu, the award-winning (and stylish) baristas take center stage. They hand-roast their own beans and pour it through a Chemex drip to maximize flavor. An Americano goes well with apple strudel or a chocolate tart topped with walnut and gold. I enjoyed the New York City-feel of The Academics, with high exposed ceilings and brick walls. (38 Yiu Wa Street, Causeway Bay)TabooHong Kong doesn't have much of an alternative club scene, but Taboo is changing the story, Alice-in-Wonderland-style. Stepping through a keyhole-shaped entry, I found myself in a topsy-turvy space where the piano's mounted on the ceiling. My friend John Skeleton describes the bar as ""a stylish version of Dr. Frankenstein's lab"" that concocts molecular cocktails with smoke and bubbles. Downstairs, Taboo keeps true to its name with racy wallpaper and a shower for dancers. (G/F, 16 Arbuthnot Road, Lan Kwai Fong, Central)SocialitoI ate Mexican food in Hong Kong, and it was as flavorful as what I had in Mazatlan. Outside the always-packed Socialito, John and I sat on bar stools and sampled soft pork belly tacos. Inside, we enjoyed tuna tostadas, grilled salmon with pumpkin seed mole and an Old Fashioned with a tequila twist. (G/F, Shop 2, The Centrium, 60 Wyndham St, Central)Lily & BloomJohn describes the concept as, ""one that recalls both fin-de-siecle inspiration and the Prohibition Era of the American 1920s."" Our tasting menu had exotic yet approachable creations; even finicky eaters would enjoy the bread-enveloped escargot cube and pasta with ostrich. Teetotalers will miss out on Lily & Bloom's artisinal cocktails, especially ""Death In Paris,"" a Hemingway-inspired poison with an absinthe base.(5/F, Hotel Rhombus LKF, 33 Wyndham Street, Central)Boqueria The Spanish tapas joint is a favorite in NYC, and recently opened a location here under Chef David Izquierdo. Boqueria's interior reflects Barcelona's bustling marketplace with dangling pork legs and classic blackboards. We started with small plates like ""bombas de la barceloneta"" (traditional croquettes), worked up to seafood paella and finished with churros con chocolate. I couldn't decide between the red and white sangria, so I had both. (7/F, Hotel Rhombus LKF, 33 Wyndham Street, Central)What do you think of Hong Kong's food culture?

Oddly enough, the family domicile tends to be expanding rather than shrinking. That includes making space for an unexpected guest: the son or daughter seeking a safe harbor when his or her marriage is in trouble. It is not uncommon for parents to find themselves opening the sleeper couch for what they hope will be a temporary stay. While most want to do whatever they can to help their children get back on their feet, but they do not necessarily want to be ""Mom"" or ""Dad"" all over again. Grown men and women who have been on their own would likely only seek their parents out as a last resort, however, in tough economic times, more and more sons and daughters (with or without grandchildren) do not have the luxury of maintaining two households and are landing on their parents' doorsteps.Parents are expected to provide unconditional support and, when appropriate, financial relief until the divorce settlement is hammered out. What most children do not realize is that their parents are struggling with their own recovery issues after the split and having a son or daughter living with them makes it that much more difficult, especially if a parent is having trouble accepting the divorce decision. The road to recovery from a child's divorce is bumpy for everyone involved. Therefore, the best advice is not to extend the journey any longer than is absolutely necessary. It is a good idea to set a flexible timeline how long the child is planning to stay from the get-go. (Note I said flexible.) If your adult child is fragile, a plan can be misinterpreted as your pulling the welcome rug out from under. Also, if you know your child is only going to be with you for a few weeks, I would let things ride. Another suggestion is to be up front about divvying household duties and expenses for food, gasoline, etc. This is, after all, Mom and Dad's place. The returning child is not a house guest with bed, board and maid service included.Typically, an adult child will seek the security of home temporarily because he or she needs the anchor of family right after a marriage crashes. A son may need a place to hang out until he finds another arrangement. Newly separated husbands often run bases on their friends' sofa beds until they finally strike out. Daughters tend to stay longer, especially if there are children, consuming lots of hot tea while they cry on Mom's shoulder. In rarer cases, it's the in-law who needs a place to stay. I know of one case where a son-in-law practically had to be pried off his mother-in-law's sofa. The in-law was his replacement parent and the two were very close during the marriage. The daughter wanted him out but he had no place to go. The mother-in-law, after first checking it out with her daughter, agreed to let him stay, but when Al became a fixture, it was time to have him leave.There is a lot of retrofitting that has to take place when an adult child's marriage ends. The newly separated or divorced mother is redefining her role primarily as wife and mother when she is no longer married; the son who was once husband and father is no longer a husband, and often spending fewer hours with his children than when he was married. He may devote more hours to work or going out with his buddies. Understandably, this is a dizzying time for parents who watch from the sidelines while their child is coping with all the changes. Parents are trying to bind wounds and build a new family structure to replace the old one. It is natural to feel ambivalent about a child's homecoming, but there are things you can do to make it less stressful. I offer lots of tips in my book, ""Your Child's Divorce: What to Expect ... What You Can Do."""

A gunman entered the school Friday morning and killed at least 26 people, including 20 young children. (AP Photo/The New Haven Register, Melanie Stengel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca0ca3c00004c0009d5c7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The world has been shocked by the terrible tragedy in Newtown, Conn., where a shooting in a primary school has resulted in the loss of 20 young children and six adults, in addition to the shooter and his mother. Our thoughts and hearts go out to their families, friends, and community, as well as to the professionals involved. In the wake of a disaster of horrific impact and proportions, be it human-made or the result of catastrophic forces of nature (as climate change has brought all too frequently in recent times), many wonder about children's responses to traumatic events and how best to support them. In addition, many children who themselves were not directly affected will be exposed to relentless media footage, potentially propagating distress and calling for helpful responses by parents, relatives and teachers. How do children respond to trauma?Children's immediate reactions vary widely. Some children are visibly frightened, agitated or upset, while other children are more withdrawn, or on the contrary, can come across as very composed. In the latter instance, it is difficult for adults to judge to what extent a child has been affected.Most children directly exposed or living in the impacted community will show stress reactions in the weeks following the traumatic event. Common reactions include nightmares, repetitive intrusive thoughts about what happened, avoidance of places or people related to the event, concentration difficulties, separation anxiety, heightened vigilance, irritability, and guilty feelings. In addition, the children involved in the shooting, in this case, will be mourning the loss of friends and teachers. For some young children, this will be the first time that they are confronted with death and its irrevocability. Children will respond differently according to their age and capacity to put their experience into words. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network has depicted age-related responses, which vary from preschool children to adolescents. Younger children may behave in ways even more childlike than their years (called regression), with less control over their feelings or behavior or even control over their toilet functions. Older children may show their fearfulness with worries, withdrawal or physical problems like stomach pain and headaches. An excellent summary for parents on the impact of a violent event such as the Newtown shootings is also available from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. Also helpful is ""After the Injury,"" which can be useful for families of injured and traumatized children; it provides clear descriptions and short videos explaining post-traumatic stress reactions and their development over time, as well as a simple checklist that can assist parents in monitoring their child's stress reaction. What can we do to support children in the direct aftermath of a traumatic event?An international consortium of trauma experts has identified the five essential actions to direct us in what we all do to help survivors after a mass trauma. These actions apply to both children and adults: 1. Promote a sense of safety. Make sure survivors feel as comfortable as possible, and reassure them that they are safe now (provided that they are really safe).2. Promote calming. For survivors who are overwhelmed by emotions, help them learn to breathe slowly -- with an emphasis on breathing out -- and to be aware of their body and surroundings.3. Promote a sense of self and community effectiveness. Survivors need to be helped to return to taking control over their own lives and decision making. Taking up normal routines as soon as possible is a fundamental rule of post-disaster responses.4. Promote connectedness. Social support is one of the most robust predictors of recovery. Help children and families turn to those they care for and trust to receive both emotional and practical support.5. Instill hope. Most people, children and adults are resilient and will eventually recover from a traumatic event. Survivors who feel confident about their capacity to recover are more likely to experience a good outcome. Based on these five essential actions, the National Center for PTSD and the NCTSN have developed and supported the use of Psychological First Aid (PFA) by mental health professionals and first responders. How you can you talk about the shooting with children who were not there With the extraordinary high levels of media coverage of this shooting, we expect that many children throughout the U.S. and internationally will become aware of this tragedy. Parents, teachers and other responsible adults will surely encounter questions about safety, even the meaning of death. Responding starts with letting children know that they are safe. For example, young children may have difficulty understanding that repeated television coverage is not a new shooting. For this reason alone, you will want to limit children's media exposure and answer their questions in an open and honest manner, without using frightening language. For young children, it may be helpful to explain death with analogies -- for example, as if they recently broke a toy that could not be fixed. The National Association for School Psychologists has a well-done brochure about talking with children about violence.Effective treatments for long-term post-traumatic stressThe gravity of the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., indicates that a significant number of directly-exposed children will experience significant post-traumatic stress reactions in the months after the shootings. Some may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-know therapy for children (and adults), and there is good evidence of its beneficial effects. The tragedy in Newtown, and its predecessor violent events, should be a further wake-up call for efforts to reduce the risk of future devastation produced by these events. While there is balm for the grief, fear and psychological wounds of the survivors, there is no remedy for their losses. We must attend to the survivors and gather the resolve to take the steps needed to identify those who are at risk to perpetrate these awful acts and to reduce their access to the weapons of destruction by which they wreck their havoc.Eva Alisic, Ph.D., is with Monash Injury Research Institute, Australia, the National Psychotrauma Center for Children and Youth, The Netherlands, and is a member of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.

Give examples of how you are doing this.  • Talk about something concrete you can do as a family to help -- like sending a donation  to an organization helping those were affected. • Understand that they, like you, may need some time to process what happened. They may  have questions -- be ready to answer them. They may be upset but not even know why,  so be patient if they act out in unusual way. • If your child is acting very sad or anxious, call your doctor for help. • Give extra hugs. They may need it.
