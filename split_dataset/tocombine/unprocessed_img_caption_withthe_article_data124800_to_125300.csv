Just how much, though, may surprise you. According to wedding planning website TheKnot, the average cost of a wedding in America last year was roughly the price of a new car, or about $30,000 (excluding the honeymoon). For its annual Real Weddings Study, released March 27, TheKnot surveyed 13,000 brides and grooms across the country and sourced statistics on everything from ""location fees"" to tuxedo costs. It found that tying the knot just keeps growing more expensive, despite the trend for casual weddings. The average wedding cost in 2013 was the highest since the website began monitoring prices in 2007. One cause may be couples' greater attention to guest experience. ""Couples are more focused than ever on creating a unique, personalized and once-in-a-lifetime experience for their guests -- plus they're doing so in a modern way, by planning from their smartphones, publicizing details on social media and more,"" Carley Roney, co-founder of The Knot, said in a statement.Overwhelmed by images of celebrity wedding extravagance and a surplus of wedding planning glossies, couples are pressured to put on a show-stopping Big Day. ""We've created this fairy tale thought in our mind of what our wedding has to be, and it has to be perfect,"" Stacy Francis, the CEO of financial planning and wealth management firm Francis Financial, told USA Today. The survey of TheKnot.com and WeddingChannel.com members revealed some other interesting data about modern weddings:Most expensive place to wed: Manhattan, $86,916 on averageAverage marrying age: bride, 29; groom, 31Wedding dress cost: New York City (and Long Island) brides spent the most money on their gowns ($3,027 and $2,160, respectively), while brides in Alaska and Oklahoma spent far less ($804 and $859, respectively)To trim costs and score vendor deals, financial planning website LearnVest has some incredible tips from recent bride Jane Bianchi, who saved $21,000 on her big day.

Researchers",2014-03-30,"BEIJING, CHINA - FEBRUARY 24: (CHINA OUT) A general view of the Jinshanling Great Walls as heavy smog engulfs the city on February 24, 2014, in Chengde, Hebei Province of China. Altogether 1.43 million sq km of China's land territory, nearly 15 percent of the total, have been covered by persistent smog in recent days, according to news report. (Photo by ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb153903c000018010bc846.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By David StanwayBEIJING, March 31 (Reuters) - China's war on pollution is only a few weeks old, but the battle lines are already being drawn between Beijing and Hebei, the province most synonymous with dirty air.A succession of Hebei officials used the annual session of parliament in Beijing this month to urge the central government to boost subsidies to help with job losses and other costs from mandated cuts in industrial production across the country. One local official said Hebei was taking on too much of the burden.The pleas came after Premier Li Keqiang, in his opening address to parliament on March 5, declared war on pollution in an attempt to head off growing anger over the quality of China's air, water and soil.Hebei, which surrounds Beijing in the country's north, was home to seven of China's 10 most polluted cities last year. Researchers blame its steel, coal and cement plants for some of the hazardous smog that increasingly envelops the capital.It is seen as a test of China's determination to build a cleaner economy after a decades-long obsession with growth.Gao Hongzhi, the Communist Party secretary of Handan, a key steel producing city, said Hebei was contributing 75 percent of the national reduction in steel capacity when it accounted for only a quarter of total output.Hebei was also contributing 50 percent of coal consumption cuts and had been set emission reduction targets that were ""much higher"" than national levels, Gao told a meeting of parliamentary delegates in the days after Li spoke.Such cuts in capacity in Handan alone would put 43,000 people out of work and cost 15 billion yuan ($2.41 billion) in ""asset losses"", Gao said without elaborating.""Once our tasks are completed, it won't just be good for Hebei or the region - it will have a big impact and will make a huge contribution to the entire country,"" Gao said at the meeting, which was attended by Reuters.""We are asking for the state to provide policy support and funding to help with layoffs while we close outdated capacity and ease overproduction.""Hebei has pledged to cut steel capacity by 60 million tonnes, more than a fifth of its total, from 2013 to the end of 2017. Coal consumption would be slashed by 40 million tonnes, around 15 percent of the total. It has also promised to cut major pollutants by around 25 percent.Wang Yifang, former chairman of China's biggest steelmaker, Hebei Iron and Steel, called for a stronger ""subsidy mechanism"" to cover the cost of shutdowns, according to documents made available by parliament.Wang Zengli, chairman of the Hebei branch of the state-backed All China Federation of Trade Unions, urged the government to provide funds for high-tech sectors. PAINFUL PROCESSHebei's Communist Party chief, Zhou Benshun, suggested the province would get help.""The structural adjustments are certainly going to be painful, but we can work to ease that pain as quickly as possible,"" he said at the meeting of parliamentary delegates.Beijing has already been paying compensation for several years to firms across China that demolish outdated steel facilities to meet new technical standards. The cuts to capacity are on top of that.Local governments have already begun to shut old plants under the new targets, most recently the demolition of 6.71 million tonnes of iron smelting capacity in late February across Hebei.Handan had closed eight steel smelters since last year, Gao said.""This has brought about a series of problems that will affect social stability,"" he said.While local officials said Hebei was making a sacrifice, environmentalists say it has been given a free ride for too long, routinely allowing its industries to beat rivals by ignoring environmental regulations and industrial standards imposed by Beijing.Critics also say Beijing has long turned a blind eye to Hebei's excesses to avoid the risk of unemployed steel workers spilling over into the already strained capital.With at least 16 steel firms stopping production, according to remarks by the Hebei governor earlier this month, those employment pressures have arrived.($1 = 6.2122 Chinese Yuan) (Editing by Dean Yates)"

In an interview with The Telegraph, Alana Haim cited the term girl band as a ""medieval"" description.“Growing up, there were a lot of girl artists like the Spice Girls, Aaliyah and Destiny’s Child,” she said. “But none of them really played instruments and I would always look up to Stevie Nicks and Blondie -- they are dope female musicians. So I just see us as a band. When people call us a girl band, I take it as an insult -- being a girl in a band shouldn’t be a thing. It seems so medieval.”The band also explained why it is that none of them became drummers, leaving that duty on stage to the ""hidden"" member of the band, Dash Hutton, even though all three are more than capable behind the kit. According to Danielle Haim, it was their father's wish -- once a drummer in the Israeli army -- that his daughter's stay away from the skins.“Dad was adamant that he didn’t want us to become drummers because he didn’t want us to lug all our s--t everywhere,” she said."

He marvels, for example, at the power of Justin Genna, who, at the climax of a sublime duet with the regal Valerie Harmon, spins and lifts her in a slow overhead press, balancing her as she stretches out parallel to the floor.Petrocci himself may well become a household name across the nation as of April 18th when Milwaukee Ballet's high-octane Peter Pan will be broadcast on national public television, with Petrocci in the title role. Those fortunate enough to see the company live next week will be spellbound not simply by the Seiwert and Neenan premières, but also by Vicente Nebrada's enduring Our Waltzes. Set to Teresa Carreño's lilting, Latin-tempered score, Waltzes is a perfect vehicle to show off the distinctive temperaments of each of the dancers and the sparks that fly between them. Contrary to the conventional view of the waltz as decorous and restrained, Nebrada emphasizes speed, athleticism, and daring. The dazzling Mayara Pineiro chews up space with her rapid bourrées.

Nebrada brings out simmering passions underneath the waltz, too -- notably in a pas de deux for Ryan Martin and Luz San Miguel (husband and wife in real life), full of languorous stretches, drags and promenades that belie their tricky execution. Ballet mistress Nadia Thompson coaches Parker Brasser-Vos as he maneuvers to get Courtney Kramer off the floor into a tricky balance on pointe then takes her through a series of rapid promenades: ""stay with her,"" she commands, as Kramer teeters on gloriously arched insteps. Thompson tinkers with a partnering hold, suggesting that Brasser-Vos release Kramer's hand and support her solely under one arm as she leans back toward him; the result is tender and daring.  The Royal Ballet-trained Thompson clearly has a prodigious memory, not just for the steps in a dance but for the minutiae of body placement, transitions, and focus.

While Pink makes a strong commitment to abstract dance, theatrical storytelling is his personal passion. He delights in the challenge of molding classic tales to resonate with contemporary audiences, believing that this may be the most effective way to bring new audiences to ballet. Clearly, other artistic directors feel the same way. Pink is aware of the multi-million dollar investments that are being made in lavish new productions these days, but in this era of shrinking philanthropy, and with the modest resources available to him, he fulfills his ambitious production goals by ""shopping locally,"" leaning heavily on the considerable artistic talent around Milwaukee. He would love to be able to offer his dancers longer contracts and commit to longer performing seasons. But even as other companies sacrifice live music or make other painful cutbacks to stay viable, Pink works hard to maintain fiscal discipline. He can point with satisfaction to the high standards of Milwaukee Ballet's school, of its in-house costume shop, its dedicated orchestra, its international choreographic competition, and thriving second company that gives him the flexibility to mount the classics and perform critical outreach within the community. ""You don't have to sell your soul to the devil,"" he maintains drily, ""to make an artistic success."" Though the company may well be outgrowing its gracious headquarters in Walker's Point, there is a sense of pride and accomplishment, particularly among this ensemble of strong and gifted dancers as they prepare to close down the season in style.

You know the names that it’s happened with in the past – Tim Tebow, LeBron James, and Johnny Manziel are just three of the players that have dominated the airwaves since they burst onto the scene. The MLB season hasn’t officially kicked off yet (unless you’re fond of significant games taking place in Australia a week before the regular season starts), and yet, we’re already reaching a critical mass with another athlete – Yasiel Puig of the Dodgers.The 23-year old Cuban phenom took the league by storm following his June debut last year, and no one has looked back. PuigMania has taken the baseball world by storm, and it’s threatening to turn into a typhoon before the season has even kicked into gear. Everything that happens involving Puig is a major story, whether he has a clubhouse meeting with manager Don Mattingly, complains about nagging injuries, misses the cut off man on a throw, or is overly aggressive on the bases. The obsession with Puig is completely overwhelming, and everything that happens surrounding him is not only deemed important, it’s deemed critical to the success or failure of the Dodgers.This isn’t just an ESPN thing, either. The only player who can compete with Puig and the articles written about him over the past few months is Derek Jeter. The columns abut Puig encompass the entire spectrum on what’s awful about the online sports media, including race baiting, appeals to authority, vehement defenses, and everything in between. David J. Roth did a great job of recapping this junk over at SBNation. It’s maddening. Puig gets thrown out on the bases trying to make something happen, and he’s a disgrace to baseball. Ryan Theriot gets a whole statistic measuring terrible baserunning named after him, and he’s still a happy scrappy hero pup.The worst part about all of this Puigmania is the fatigue aspect of it. I love watching Puig play baseball, but guess what? I don’t need to see literally *every* thing he does on the field. If you’re cutting in to show me a Puig at bat in the eighth inning of a 7-0 game, things have gone too far. I don’t care. I won’t care, unless he’s trying for a historical achievement.The worst part of Puig Fatigue is some sportswriters are trying to use the Dodgers star to launch attacks against other writers they look down their noses at.It’s insignificant, doesn’t matter, and is just pissing everybody off to the point that we’re forgetting what we’re even arguing about in the first place.What?!?!We are rapidly approacing that point of no return with Yasiel Puig. Those articles repeating the same talking points over and over again are simply going to continue this season. We’re not going to hear about the Dodgers winning 5-3 because of a great game from Hanley Ramirez, we’re going to hear about how Puig nearly cost them the game by doing something that most players do.I really hope we don’t ruin the joy of watching Yasiel Puig play baseball – he’s an incredibly exciting player that can be one of MLB’s most marketable stars if they play their cards right. But I fear that’s exactly where we are headed.The line needs to be toed between promotion and overexposure. Everyone in MLB has to be wary to save Yasiel Puig from turning into little more than a debate point. Otherwise, Puig is going to be a player that people hate simply because he’s being shoved down their throats every time they look at the TV. And at a time when baseball needs everything it can to feel good about itself, that would be a real shame."

You see, I do everything first, and then she does the same thing only better. I was born a year before she was. I had my baby a year before she had her first. I spatchcocked my first local, organic chicken a year before she did. And I separated from my husband a year (and a half) before Gwyneth Paltrow separated from her husband.Just like everything else, Gwyneth's ""conscious uncoupling"" is already so much better than anything my ex-husband and I could ever come up with. How does she do it? Man. If you're looking for the ultimate aspirational separation, take out your bespoke stationary and fountain pen and take notes.1. First of all, her euphemism: Conscious uncoupling . Why didn't I think of that? All this time I've been calling it things like ""shit-show detangling"" and ""marital meiosis."" Her euphemism is so much more soulful and poetic, right?2. They won't have lawyers or a mediator, they'll have ""uncoupling facilitators."" And they'll probably meet in heavenly-scented offices with soft lighting. There will be hand-holding and green tea. Everyone will understand each other, and there will be no uncomfortable crying or arguing.3. It'll all get settled super quickly. In fact, they've probably finished already. Mine is taking forever.4. There will be an uncoupling event. It will be this beautiful ceremony officiated by GP's ""very good friend"" Kabbalah guru Michael Berg and her other ""very good friend"" Episcopal priest Cynthia Bourgealt. It will be catered by Mario Batali. GP will wear a custom Uncoupled pantsuit by Stella McCartney, and she'll look stunning in it. It'll be white. There will be an acoustic number by Chris, with the kids singing backup. Everyone will cry mostly happy tears and then they'll all hug in silence.5. Gwyneth will have a special Me&Ro Uncoupled ring made and sell it via Goop. I will entertain the idea of buying it for myself and then remember that I'm a single mom who also has to buy her son shoes.6. Thanks to this week's announcement, Gwyneth probably already has a long line of potential boyfriends outside her door. While I -- oh wait! Hah -- once again I am first, for I have already nabbed the best boyfriend ever in the world. Sorry, GP. He's all mine. This is one area where you don't have me beat.7. All her servants will take care of all the crap single moms have to deal with, so she won't ever look haggard or overwhelmed. Like I do. Every single morning. No running out the door late in the morning with a load of laundry in one arm and a bag of garbage in the other hand for her!8. Gwyneth will write a brilliant, best-selling book on how to have the finest divorce ever.Okay, all joking aside, I am sad it didn't work out between GP and Chris Martin, and I really do hope their split is as amicable and peaceful as possible, especially for their kids.Do you think Gwyneth Paltrow's divorce will be different from an ordinary mortal's divorce?More from The Stir: 5 Tips for Surviving Relationships After Divorce 6 Ridiculous Divorce Stats That Will Scare Any Sane Woman 9 Things I Didn't Expect About Getting a Divorce 20 Things Divorce Taught Me 10 Things I'll Do Differently in My Second MarriageKeep in touch!

That latter point may actually be easier to demonstrate. Given the way the term ""violent video games"" is defined in the scholarly community, almost all video games are violent video games, including Pac-Man, as a scholar had to admit in one recent court case. My point is that the concept of ""violent video games,"" which society has been debating as long as video games have been around (yes, politicians and scholars once seriously worried over the impact of games like Pac-Man, Centipede and Zaxxon), is so vague that it has little real meaning.We'd all agree that a game such as Grand Theft Auto 5 is a violent video game, but where exactly do we draw the line between violent and nonviolent games? What about a game like Starcraft, which is mainly a strategy game? Or my son's current favorite video game, Lego Marvel Super Heroes, which involves gruesome (kidding) Lego deaths? If we play competitively in free play, trying to zap each other, is this more violent than following the story narrative? Or was that line between violent and nonviolent crossed long ago with Pac-Man, Centipede, Zaxxon and other ""violent"" games of the 1980s?   This issue of exactly what is a violent video game (along with the poor quality of much of the research) bedeviled the U.S. Supreme Court in its 2011 Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association decision. As became apparent in that case (and in cases before it), much of the scholarly community has come to consider media violence an all-encompassing whole, such that a picture of a gun is as likely to increase aggression as is a violent video game. Much time has been spent debating the merits of the aggression measures used in this research (and see the Supreme Court's majority reaction to them, which was less-than-impressed, to say the least), but the vagueness of the term ""violent video game"" (or ""media violence,"" for that matter) is also problematic for how the construct is measured in research. Many studies continue to settle for dubious approaches, such as allowing kids to rate how violent the games they play are, then asking them how aggressive they are, an approach that can cause spurious correlations. Other surveys assume that entire genres of games can be reliably scored as violent or nonviolent without even knowing the individual game titles. Perhaps we might consider M-rated games as the really violent video games (ignoring that whole theoretical bit about how any game violence, or even looking at a picture of a gun, is bad). But here too, a game such as Bioshock Infinite is very different from one such as Grand Theft Auto 5, which is very different from one such as The Walking Dead. The game narratives and the context in which violence occurs are very different. So does the concept of ""violent video game"" have any meaning at all? If Pac-Man is a violent video game just as Grand Theft Auto 5 is a violent video game, the whole concept is absurd. When we use the term ""violent video game,"" we make an assumption that all games that contain any violent content, no matter how minor, and no matter the context, share some kind of conceptual space that is relevant. Indeed, I suggest that use of the term ""violent video game"" survives, both in the general public and in the scholarly community, not because it has actual conceptual utility but because it is emotionally loaded. We might be willing to celebrate and defend the artistic and social merit of individual M-rated games such as Bioshock, Halo 2, Mass Effect 2 and Fallout 3 (all of which were recognized as art by the Smithsonian Institute), but defending ""violent video games"" as a concept is, emotionally, a little like defending ""porn"" as a concept. In the research community, the widespread use of such emotionally laden terminology can easily set up researcher expectancy effects that can influence social science results. Such terms arguably also put pressure on professional advocacy groups such as the American Psychological Association (APA) that may be reluctant to appear to defend such emotionally described media by doing anything other than condemning it, whatever the data may say. But, ultimately, I argue that the concept of ""violent video games"" has about as much conceptual utility as ""blond people"" does in informing us about the characteristics of individual women and men. Our insistence on treating the concept of ""violent video games"" as something meaningful has succeeded mainly in keeping debates on video games emotional rather than rational. Furthermore, I argue that such terms have maintained researchers' focus on an emotionally loaded Holy Grail in trying to link such media to an array of public health outcomes. Too often, this has functioned as a block to a sophisticated program of research examining the specific and idiosyncratic ways in which specific game design elements interact with specific users' wants and needs in ways that are probably both more interesting and valuable. We can only hope that a new, nuanced, more balanced approach such as that recently suggested by Isabella Granic and her colleagues in the APA's flagship journal will hold sway in future research."

A trio,2014-03-29,"Plastic Water Bottle Floating in Pacific Ocean, Santa Monica, California, USA (Photo by Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1536e2400003200553d0a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From Mother Nature Network's Bryan Nelson:What's one solution to the growing problem of plastic water bottle waste? A trio of Spanish design students think they have the answer, and it involves creating a ""water bottle"" that you can eat, reports Co.Exist.  Designers Rodrigo García González, Guillaume Couche and Pierre Paslier call their creation ""Ooho,"" a gelatinous blob that is actually a membrane that encapsulates water like a bladder. When you're thirsty, just puncture the membrane and drink. Or, if you also have an appetite, just pop a bite-sized Ooho in your mouth and chomp down for a burst of hydration. The gooey membrane, made from brown algae and calcium chloride, is edible, hygienic and biodegradable.  The Ooho globule is formed through a process called ""spherification,"" a methodology first pioneered in 1946 and still utilized by some chefs in modern cuisine. Water is frozen into ice before being encapsulated to ease the process and prevent the water from mixing with the membrane ingredients. The bag-like containers are also incredibly cheap — each one costs just 2 cents to make, and they could even be concocted at home.  ""Anyone can make them in their kitchen, modifying and innovating the recipe,"" said co-designer García. ""It's not DIY but CIY — cook it yourself.""  Similar products have already made it to the market; an edible food delivery system called WikiPearl is available at select Whole Foods markets. Ooho is the first such container designed specifically for replacing water bottles, however.  One immediate use for the Ooho water containers could be for running sports events. Runners often hydrate by grabbing paper cups from spectators as they run, creating a lot of trash. Ooho offers an waste-free alternative; it could even be infused with electrolytes to give competitors an athletic edge.  The design was a winner of the second annual Lexus Design Award and will also be featured during Milan Design Week. You can view users testing out the Ooho water containers in the following video by Fast Company:"
