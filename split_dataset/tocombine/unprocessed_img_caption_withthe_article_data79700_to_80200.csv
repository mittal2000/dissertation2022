My husband-then-boyfriend and I had an argument about finally getting a T.V., and in 2015, my television is still a big, square box.  (The above photograph was taken when the baby should have been in bed, but was, instead, parading around playing with all of her sleeping big sister's toys. I captioned it, on Instagram, #gothefucktosleep.)In other words, I obviously was a mom who swore that my kids would not be T.V. watchers. But they are. Even my 10-month-old baby peers around her big sister's head to see what she's watching.I'm not saying that we should let our kids watch copious amounts of T.V., or that we should be turning to it as our first solution, but I will say this: T.V. has saved me from yelling at my kids, it's helped me get in a 20-minute workout that made me a better mom for the rest of my day, and it's also helped my daughter learn new words. In short, get off the T.V.-high-horse earlier on than I did.Change your idea of exercise.I saw a good workout, before kids, as one that had my full attention and lasted for at least an hour. Now, if I do 20 minutes of Pilates, a few yogic sun salutations or press out a few sets with my free weights, I see my exercise as a success.I've realized that something is better than nothing, and that it takes only a little bit of movement to get my endorphins going to help me feel better; recharged.Become okay with doing a little bit every day.More, when I do make it to the yoga studio for a 75-minute, hot Baptiste-style session, I find that my daily 15 to 20 minutes of yoga practice must be doing the job of keeping me strong and limber, because longer sessions still feel glorious.If you have the ability to take more time more often than I do, then good for you, but for the rest of the mom population out there, stop making excuses and just move your body for a few minutes each day.Stick with breastfeeding.This is likely the most personalized one on this list. Breastfeeding does not work for all moms and each mom out there should always do what works best for her and her family. That said, nearly all of my friends -- myself included, and with both of my children -- had a difficult introduction into nursing. Those first couple of weeks are typically a challenge. However, sticking with it is, in my experience, easier in the long run, at least for those first few weeks and months of motherhood.Breastfeeding means easy, portable food, no bottle washing or sterilizing, and it's free.So free the nipple.Let your house look like Toys ""R"" Us barfed all over it.I also swore that I would not be one of those people with kids' toys all over. You should see my house.Regardless of how often I pick up, it's nearly always littered with a stuffed Olaf from Frozen that's bigger than my baby is, with random Little People, with toy trucks -- and I stopped caring.Do I sometimes care, when I just picked up Every. Single. Toy, only to turn around from using the bathroom to find that each object has already been dragged back out? A little. But then I look at my smiling kids playing together and acknowledge that I did get to dash to the bathroom alone because the girls were entranced with putting miniature dolls onto a pink, plastic school bus.Eat.Let me elaborate.I've heard so many new moms say that they don't eat well, or even often, throughout the day because -- and it is -- difficult to do so with small children.But -- big but here -- eating healthy, unprocessed foods as often as possible makes my body feel better, which, in turn, makes my moods more stable and, basically, just helps me deal with the frustration that often is mothering.Sure, I sometimes -- okay, usually -- eat faster than I'd like to. Yes, sometimes eating healthy means planning ahead (like how I love to keep a dozen boiled eggs ready to go in the refrigerator). But it's worth it. Especially if we are breastfeeding, our own nutrition counts -- and our self-care sets a healthy example for our children.Stop wearing dangly earrings.At least for the first year. More likely two. If you want to keep your ear lobes attached. 'Nuff said.Keep random toys and books stashed in the bathroom.For your soon-to-be frequent bathroom companions. Trust me on this one. Moving on.Keep the toilet paper out of reach.I remember the first time I had company over, after I finally admitted that toilet paper holders were for masochists.At first, I felt embarrassed that the cute little metal contraption connected to the adjoining wall was empty, and that all of our t.p. sat perched in a nice stack, high enough to make it slightly uncomfortable to actually grab when needed. But then I let go of that embarrassment because the rest of my life, when company is not visiting, no longer involves cleaning up chewed up or unrolled toilet tissue.Occasionally abide by ""it's five o'clock somewhere.""Now, I'm the first mother out there to admit that I'll do a short yoga practice if I feel like I need a drink.For one, I don't want to neeeed a drink -- I want to enjoy one when I have it.That said, every living mother out there will, from time to time, be best served by looking at the clock, seeing that it reads only four p.m., and still go ahead and pour that glass of wine.Throw out ""shoulds.""The biggest piece of advice that I would love to go back in time and give to my new-mother self five years ago is this: let go of expectations.By all means, have ideals and goals, but also recognize that our visions of who we will be as a parent are not real.What is real is the bathroom partner who goes through the phase of pulling off the toilet paper from its holder -- and then eating it.What is real is turning on the T.V. in the middle of the day so that our oldest child doesn't have to hear the baby scream her head off while falling asleep.What is real, too, is the love -- and that's waaaaay better than we could have imagined.Still, even love doesn't always help out when we're exhausted, and dealing with tantrums, and a spouse who is coming home late from work, after the baby had diarrhea all day (made up example).What does help, though, is loving ourselves enough to stop expecting perfection and, alternately, embrace the reality that it doesn't get more real than motherhood--thank goodness."

Thousands of people are expected to turn out as the city's trademark ""second line"" parades snake through the streets and New Orleans puts its famous musical traditions on display.But Saturday is also a time to remember more than 1,500 New Orleanians who were killed by Katrina and its aftermath, and the 130,000 residents who were displaced.""A celebration would not be the right gesture for those who will never be made whole,"" said Kristian Sonnier, an official at the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""This is more taking stock and recognizing what we have accomplished and that we have a lot more work to do,"" he said.Saturday will cap a week of self-examination that has included panel discussions by urban planners, elected officials, recovery experts, architects and neighborhood leaders.The day begins early with a wreath-laying ceremony in one of the city's historic above-ground cemeteries, the site of the Hurricane Katrina Memorial. The remains of 83 ""forgotten"" victims have rested there since 2008, their bodies never claimed by relatives. Mayor Mitch Landrieu will pay tribute to them during a brief service.Other places that were hard-hit will host memorials as well. At Shell Beach, in lower St. Bernard Parish just east of New Orleans, public officials and residents will gather along a waterway that burst through a levee in 2005 and killed 127 people. The ceremony will feature a reading of the names of victims, now etched into a monument there.  Tributes are slated in the city's Lower Ninth Ward, where surging waters broke a floodwall on the city's Industrial Canal and devastated the entire neighborhood. Similarly, Lakeview, Broadmoor, Mid-City and a host of other areas are looking back on 2005 with mixed emotions.""There aren't enough words to describe the loss, especially for the people of the Lower Ninth Ward, because the breach that drowned their neighborhood was the worst in the city,"" said civic activist Sandy Rosenthal on Friday, just after she had walked in a second-line parade through the ward.At the same time, she says, the progress the city has made in 10 years is undeniable.A march and hand-holding ceremony is scheduled at the city's Superdome, which housed thousands of displaced people after the storm and became an emblem of the chaos and hardship that engulfed New Orleans after the flooding.""It's a great feeling to see that so many people have come back to the city and are doing well, but depression sets in when you think of those who died or those who want to come back but haven't been able to return,"" said Barbara Blackwell, whose home in the Gentilly neighborhood was a casualty of the flood.""I know that for many people, this anniversary unearths old wounds, but it's also a healing process,"" Blackwell said. ""The pain never goes away, but it helps to know that loved ones who were lost are being remembered."" While some residents find it hard to look back, many are heartened to see that national figures continue to show concern and admiration for New Orleans.President Barack Obama paid tribute to the city’s recovery in a visit to the Lower Ninth Ward on Thursday. “I am inspired by you,” he told his audience at a local community center.Former President George W. Bush, who critics say was slow to respond to the unfolding crisis a decade ago, visited the city on Friday. Former President Bill Clinton will address a gathering at a downtown arena on Saturday that will also feature a lineup of well-known local musicians.(Editing by Frank McGurty and Lisa Shumaker) "

5,SPORTS,From 'Katrina Kid' To Nebraska Quarterback: Tommy Armstrong Beats The Odds,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tommy-armstrong-hurricane-katrina-kids_us_55de1c30e4b08cd3359e6ac1,"A decade ago, Hurricane Katrina forced Nebraska's quarterback from his home. As the nation marks an anniversary, he's only focused on producing his biggest season yet.",2015-08-29,<p>Gulfport's Grand Casino barge washed ashore onto Highway 90 during Hurricane Katrina before transportation officials demolished it and moved it back to the beach.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Nadine Armstrong took her son to his grandparents’ house as the skies darkened, and left him there as the ocean began to bellow off the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Now the starting quarterback at the University of Nebraska, Tommy Armstrong wasn’t even a teenager then, and even as the winds howled and water surged into the streets of Gulfport, Mississippi, he wasn’t scared. His mother had spent the week before telling him not to fear the hurricane they called Katrina.So Tommy didn’t know that the storm had already pounded Florida, that it had paused to hover over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico long enough to grow from just another hurricane into one of historic strength.When it finally blew through, the house where Tommy lived with his mother suffered water and roof damage but was still standing. But in a matter of weeks, he’d join hundreds of thousands of Gulf Coast residents who flocked to the drier lands of Texas. He remembers now that he was “devastated” to leave his mother. But he was lucky, too. His father and younger brother already lived in San Antonio. He had somewhere to go.Today, as the nation marks the 10th anniversary of one of the most destructive storms in the Gulf Coast’s history -- the storm that changed Tommy Armstrong's life -- Armstrong is focused on football. The start of his third season as the Cornhuskers’ quarterback is now just a week away. Every year is a big one, he said, but this one needs to be his biggest yet.Armstrong came to Lincoln as a heralded recruit, a perfect fit to become the next in a line of quarterbacks that have threatened defenses with their legs as much as their arms. He showed signs of that promise early, helping Nebraska to 17 wins in his first two seasons, but now he faces an entirely new challenge: New coach Mike Riley prefers a more traditional passing attack, and Armstrong has to show Husker fans he can thrive in that system too.Anxious to prove and improve himself, Armstrong spent the last two summers back on the football fields of Mississippi, where he worked under the eyes of Brett Favre, the NFL legend who laid the foundation for a Hall of Fame career while at Hancock North Central High just down the road. Favre lived through Katrina from afar. Still in Green Bay, Wisconsin, at the time, it took him days to make contact with his family in the area. Katrina’s floodwaters washed his boyhood home away.But even back in Mississippi, Armstrong’s mind stayed trained on his arm angle, his reads, his release point.“We didn’t really talk about it,” he said of the storm. Favre drilled home the habits and techniques that made him the NFL’s all-time leader in passing yards and, when he retired in 2010, passing touchdowns. Katrina didn’t enter the conversation. “We didn’t really talk about the past.”Gulfport is a football town. In days past, it was the type of place where local businesses shut down on Friday nights. There wasn’t any reason to stay open if everybody was at the game. The region has produced its share of collegiate and professional talent, and Tommy Armstrong Jr. was born into that lineage. His father, Tommy Sr., was a standout at Gulfport High in the 1980s -- Armstrong the elder was “one heck of an athlete,” his former coach recalled. Nadine played softball and basketball at the school. Before the storm, everyone thought Tommy Jr. would play at Gulfport one day too.Katrina blew into the Mississippi Gulf Coast in the early morning hours of Aug. 29, 2005, and brought with it a 30-foot tidal wave that left parts of Gulfport seven or eight feet underwater. The tides swept over the railroad tracks a mile or so inland. They ripped beachfront homes off their foundations and tore the city’s iconic casinos from their moorings. Rising waters littered the Gulfport streets with barges and shipping containers and everything else they could find to carry.Gulfport, the state’s second-largest city, is the seat of Harrison County, which suffered the most damage in Mississippi. The city’s fire chief estimated that three-quarters of its buildings suffered major roof damage. The storm gutted the local hospital and hammered the city's elementary schools. The area around Gulfport and neighboring Biloxi lost 41,000 residents, more than any other single area outside New Orleans.Katrina hit just as students readied to return to school, or, as they measure the calendar in the South, right as football season was about to begin.Suddenly, football went from the front page of every local paper to an afterthought. “Everybody was on their own trying to recover,” said Lindy Callahan, a former athletic director at Gulfport High School, the only secondary school in the city’s school district. “Most people were either hit or had family involved. It wasn’t anything about football or school then. It was just about seeing if we could recover.”When there actually was time to consider football, it was “just see if we could have a season at all,” he said.School and the 2005 football season returned in September after a three-week delay. But Katrina had decimated the Gulfport district, which saw enrollment drop by nearly 2,000 -- a third of its pre-storm student body.“We lost so many students, lost so many athletes,” Callahan said. “It stayed that way for four or five years.”Like more than 80 percent of those who left Mississippi in the days and weeks after the storm, Tommy Armstrong eventually came back, returning to Gulfport for middle school a year after Katrina.He had loved growing up on the beach. But after Katrina, Gulfport’s white sand shorelines were almost useless, swept away in the floods and suffocated by debris and the efforts to clean up. He had always noticed the casinos, too, the hulking structures that line the beaches from Gulfport to Biloxi, a dozen miles up the coast. The water pushed one of them across Highway 90, almost to his mother's house.In Gulfport, Armstrong helped lead his middle-school football team to two consecutive undefeated seasons. But before high school, he decided to move back to Texas. The opportunity to mentor his younger brother and have his father in his life pulled him back. So, too, did the chance to hone his skills in the hotbed of American high school football.On the field, at Steele High in Cibolo, 30 miles northeast of San Antonio, Armstrong blossomed into one of the nation’s top high school quarterbacks. He led the Knights to two straight appearances in the Class 5A state title game and amassed more than 1,500 all-purpose yards in each of his final two seasons. He caught the eye of college recruiters -- Rivals.com pegged him as the nation’s ninth-best dual-threat quarterback -- and he chose Nebraska, a natural fit for a signal-caller as adept at running as he was throwing, without giving other schools much of a chance.In Lincoln, injuries to Nebraska’s starting quarterback forced Armstrong onto the field as a redshirt freshman in 2013. The Huskers won eight games, and his ability to beat defenses with his arm showed up in flashes. In the 2014 Gator Bowl, with Nebraska facing 3rd-and-long from their own goalline, Armstrong dropped deep into his own end zone and hit wide receiver Quincy Enunwa in stride 45 yards downfield. Enunwa shoved off a tackle and took it to the end zone. It was the longest play in Nebraska history, and the decisive score in the Huskers' 24-19 win over Georgia.As a sophomore, Armstrong threw for nearly 2,700 yards and 22 touchdowns and led the Huskers to nine wins. But that’s not good enough in Lincoln, where conference titles and national championship contention are the markers of success. In December, Nebraska fired head coach Bo Pelini, which Armstrong protestations. Riley left Oregon State to take the job three days later. Now that star running back Ameer Abdullah is gone to the NFL, all eyes are on Armstrong as the Huskers try to push their way back to the upper echelons of college football.Turn the conversation to the gridiron and the pressure he might be facing, and a confident Tommy Armstrong emerges.“Every season I want to have a big season,” he said. “But I think this year will be one of my best.""They’re watching back on the coast.“He’s still one of ours,” Callahan, the former Gulfport High coach and athletic director, said. “I rate him to be the star quarterback this year.”Forced to hastily relocate into new cities and neighborhoods, thousands of Louisianans and Mississippians who migrated to the Lone Star State’s largest cities met varying degrees of welcome. They were often blamed for crime waves and homicide sprees, despite little evidence to support such claims. School districts in San Antonio, Houston and Dallas did their best to open arms to children who found themselves plopped into new cities, homes and schools, but it wasn’t always a smooth process. Newspapers published anecdotal accounts of Katrina kids fighting with their new classmates as they struggled to fit in.Mississippi’s schools did not undergo the sweeping changes that took place in New Orleans, where the state took over and closed many public schools and converted others to charters. But Mississippi's children of Katrina faced their own problems. “The story doesn’t end well,” said Dr. Michael Ward, an educational psychology professor at the University of Southern Mississippi.Two years after Katrina, kids who were displaced in the storm -- meaning they started the 2005 school year in one school and finished it in another -- had lower rates of attendance and academic achievement than those who didn’t have to move, and than they’d had before the storm. They were less likely to move on to the next grade on time and had higher rates of suspension and expulsion than before the storm hit, a study Ward co-authored found.Katrina’s effects on the children who lived through it persisted long after the floodwaters receded back into the Gulf. Five years later, rates of suspension for displaced students “were the highest yet,” Ward said.“Some of these things predated the storm,” Ward said. “(Katrina) made them worse.”The children who faced Katrina’s worst educational and sociological effects were disproportionately poor and minority students, the study found. Though its research was limited to Mississippi, schools in Louisiana have faced even harsher problems -- in 2006, 20 percent of displaced students were not enrolled or missed school regularly. Those problems still linger: No state in America has more people between the ages 16 and 24 who are neither working nor enrolled in school. It is likely, Ward said, that some of the same problems his team found in Mississippi plagued displaced students in Texas and other states too.Armstrong was remarkably lucky. He knows he faced an “easier transition” than many of his fellow students. He knew the San Antonio area from spending summers with his father there as a child, and living with Tommy Sr. and mentoring his younger brother grounded him in his new home in San Antonio. He missed his mother, but they made a promise to talk at least once a week to keep Nadine up on his schoolwork, his friends, his life -- and his football, too.Dr. David A. Swanson, a professor at the University of California-Riverside who worked at the University of Mississippi in 2005, went to the Gulf Coast after the storm hit. After assisting with recovery efforts, he and a team of researchers looked into the effects Katrina had on local residents. They found that those with well-established social networks -- through family, church, social organizations, and though they didn’t study it exactly, perhaps football and other sports too -- fared best in the immediate term after the storm.Still, catastrophic events have immeasurable traumatic effects on children, and studies have shown that when it comes to Katrina, those who were adolescents when the storm hit might have fared worst. Kids like Armstrong who made it to college and beyond, Ward said, “beat the odds.”It is not hard to find stories of football players who lost homes or had to move, even temporarily, because of Katrina. In the weeks and months after the storm, thousands of them were pushed into different schools in states they had never before visited. The storm interrupted high school seasons, delayed arrivals to college, changed the course of careers forever. Three of San Antonio’s top high school football recruits in Armstrong’s senior class were Katrina kids. In the years before, and in other parts of Texas, the number was even higher. For many of them, football was one way to cope, an outlet into which they could channel the frustrations and struggles of old homes lost and new homes Katrina forced them to find. Armstrong echoes the life lessons many of those players say they took away from the storm. Katrina, he said, made him “grow up a little bit” and appreciate what he has -- not materially, but through his family. He returns to Gulfport once or twice a year, and it’s impossible to miss the ways the city is still trying to piece itself all the way back together, and the ways it hasn’t.Displaced residents eventually started to return to Gulfport, and the need to rebuild the city opened up construction jobs that lured new families. Enrollment bounced back, and football started to come with it. The district rebuilt the school and Gulfport High’s stadium. In the weeks and years after Katrina, football grew into a symbol of the region’s resilience, as high schools across Louisiana and Mississippi that had fought just to field teams for the 2005 season slowly rebuilt programs and stadiums and won new championship banners to hang in them.But Gulfport is still littered with reminders. Concrete slabs line the shoreline where homes that will never return once sat. There are new casinos, shops and stores, but some are still missing. There are opportunities for young men and women who didn’t have enough football talent to carry them somewhere else, but probably fewer than there were a decade ago.“It’s getting there,” Armstrong said. “You can’t really rebuild ... in five to 10 years. It’s a work in progress.”Armstrong doesn’t spend much time pondering how life might be different had Katrina not hit, had he not had somewhere to go when it did. When he does, his mind wanders back to football.“I sometimes wish I’d have gotten to see how that would have turned out,” he said of the possibility of playing at Gulfport High with his middle school teammates, the ones who’d gone twice undefeated. He paused for just a second. “But I don’t have any regrets,"" he added. ""I got myself into a great situation.”"

Now the starting quarterback at the University of Nebraska, Tommy Armstrong wasn’t even a teenager then, and even as the winds howled and water surged into the streets of Gulfport, Mississippi, he wasn’t scared. His mother had spent the week before telling him not to fear the hurricane they called Katrina.So Tommy didn’t know that the storm had already pounded Florida, that it had paused to hover over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico long enough to grow from just another hurricane into one of historic strength.When it finally blew through, the house where Tommy lived with his mother suffered water and roof damage but was still standing. But in a matter of weeks, he’d join hundreds of thousands of Gulf Coast residents who flocked to the drier lands of Texas. He remembers now that he was “devastated” to leave his mother. But he was lucky, too. His father and younger brother already lived in San Antonio. He had somewhere to go.Today, as the nation marks the 10th anniversary of one of the most destructive storms in the Gulf Coast’s history -- the storm that changed Tommy Armstrong's life -- Armstrong is focused on football. The start of his third season as the Cornhuskers’ quarterback is now just a week away.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said on Friday that he is open to changing the United States' birthright citizenship policy, marking a reversal from his past remarks on the issue.During an interview, conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked the Republican presidential hopeful about the current debate over the 14th Amendment, which grants American citizenship to any individual born on U.S. soil. ""Yesterday, Marco Rubio said he wouldn't support a law to abrogate birthright citizenship. But you would, to be clear?"" Hewitt asked. ""I would, because I think that when we see advertisements in China, advertising essentially 'birth tourism,' where people are able to purchase packages so they fly to the U.S., have their baby in the U.S. so it has dual citizenship, and it's not -- these aren’t people who are impoverished, looking for a Medicaid payment,"" Huckabee said. ""These are very wealthy people who are coming here so their child will in essence be able to put a foot down and say, 'I have American citizenship, dual citizenship.'"" ""I just don't see how we can sit back and say that that's perfectly OK,"" he added.Listen to Huckabee's remarks: In 2010, Huckabee told NPR he was against repealing parts of the 14th Amendment.""I don't think that's even possible,"" he said. ""Let me tell you what I would favor. I would favor having controlled borders... but that's where the federal government has miserably and hopelessly failed us.""But on Friday, Huckabee questioned the current interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which reads, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" ""I think it would be helpful for there to be legislation defining what the jurisdiction clause means,"" the former governor told Hewitt. ""I don't think a constitutional amendment is likely to happen, but I don't think it has to be constitutional amendment."" A Huckabee spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Debate over the 14th Amendment came to the forefront of the GOP primary after Donald Trump called for an end to birthright citizenship earlier this month. A number of Republican candidates have since followed suit and spoken out in favor of ending or changing the policy. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, like Huckabee, has addressed ""birth tourism,"" particularly in the cases of Chinese women who pay to come to the United States to give birth so their children can grow up as American citizens. (Huckabee, however, did not use the term ""anchor babies."")""Americans are disgusted with the immigration process because people are using the good nature of the American way of life to cheat our system and to benefit from it,"" Huckabee said. ""And I think people are sick of it.""Also on HuffPost:"

They are recovering in hospital.“The emergency doctor told us they would not have made it much longer - two, maybe three hours,” said David Furtner, police spokesman for Upper Austria province.The incident follows the discovery of the corpses of 71 refugees in an abandoned lorry on an Austrian highway on Thursday - victims of an unfolding tragedy as refugees and migrants escaping conflict and poverty in Africa, Asia and the Middle East flock to Europe in unprecedented numbers.The International Organization for Migration estimates a third of a million people have crossed the Mediterranean so far this year, leaving from Libya, Turkey and other countries to land in Europe.Hundreds have drowned in shipwrecks but the recent deaths on land have exposed another horrific side of the people-smuggling racket.“The driver did not give a damn about the people in the back. We would not transport animals under these conditions on our roads in Austria,” said Furtner, refering to Friday’s discovery.Austria lies on the way from poorer countries in southern and eastern Europe where many refugees first land, such as Greece, to more prosperous nations in the north and west.DRIVER ARRESTEDThe 29-year-old Romanian driver of the van found on Friday, registered in Romania, was arrested. The children and their parents were taken to the hospital in Braunau, where they are now in a stable condition.Among the dead found in the lorry on Thursday, four were children, one of them a baby girl, police said on Saturday. They were presumed to be from Syria - in the grip of a four-year-old civil war - or possibly Afghanistan.Three Bulgarians and an Afghan arrested in Hungary in connection with the deaths made their first appearance in a court in the central Hungarian town of Kecskemet on Saturday. They were given one month’s detention pending further proceedings.A prosecution spokesman told journalists the truck had left Kecskemet and picked up the migrants near Hungary’s border with Serbia, before taking them through Hungary to Austria.Police hoped to identify the dead refugees by examining mobile phones found on some of the bodies. Searches of backpacks, luggage and clothing had provided few clues apart from one Syrian travel document, said Helmut Marban, a police spokesman in Burgenland province.Marban was speaking in front of a former customs hall where the lorry was parked on a tarpaulin to catch fluids, with investigators in protective suits gathering forensic evidence.Police estimated the refugees could have been dead for up to two days and the truck might have been standing on the hard shoulder of the highway for as long as 24 hours.“It seems unbelievable,” said Marban, asked about how 71 people could have fitted into the medium-sized refrigeration lorry.“At first when they got in they were of course standing, but when we had to bring them out they were (entangled) all together.”In nearby camps, refugees said the news had left them stunned, but they saw little choice but to flee to Europe.“We had to walk so much, it was so dangerous, in the forest and in the water,” said 21-year-old Qariburahman, who had been on the road for a month before Austrian police picked him up and brought him to the Nickelsdorf refugee reception center.“When I came from Afghanistan, about three people died on the way, the way is very dangerous,” he said.His journey had cost him $5,000.A Syrian refugee in the camp of Traiskirchen south of Vienna said people had no choice but go with traffickers.“We didn’t know what the car was, maybe it’s a truck, maybe it’s a van. And we had to follow (the trafficker) because in his area, he is the boss,” he said, his pregnant wife and baby son close by.“My wife, she told me, oh maybe we were supposed to be one of them ... maybe it is one of my friends, maybe it is one of my brothers on that truck.’”""MASS GRAVE""On another front in the crisis, Libyan authorities arrested three people on suspicion of involvement in launching a boat packed with migrants that sank off the country's Mediterranean coast, killing up to 200 people, a security official said.The vessel, with up to 400 African, Syrian and Asian migrants on board, capsized on Thursday after setting off from the town of Zuwara, close to the Italian island of Lampedusa and a center of operations for people smugglers exploiting the anarchy in Libya, a country with two rival governments.By Saturday, 115 bodies had been recovered and about 198 migrants rescued, officials said.Arrests of smugglers are rare in Libya, where the judiciary has little power since the country is effectively controlled by former rebel groups which helped to oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.The head of the European Parliament meanwhile said the ""glaring failures"" of some European countries to take in refugees were turning the Mediterranean into a mass grave.Martin Schulz, a German Social Democrat, said those European governments that had resisted European Union proposals to agree a common plan must do more to deal with the crisis.He did not single out any states. However, Hungary, which is part of Europe's passport-free Schengen zone, is building a fence along its border with Serbia to contain what it calls a threat to European security, prosperity and identity.""The Mediterranean becomes a mass grave, gruesome scenes play out at borders, there is mutual blame - and those in greatest need, seeking our protection, are left without help,"" Schulz told Germany's Die Welt newspaper.Germany's highest court on Saturday overturned a weekend ban on assemblies in an eastern town that was the scene of violent protests against refugees. More than 30 policemen were injured in clashes in the town of Heidenhau, near Dresden, last weekend.Chancellor Angela Merkel traveled to Heidenau on Monday and condemned the protests. Germany expects the number of asylum seekers to quadruple to about 800,000 this year.Also on HuffPost:"

With a GDP estimated at upwards of $320 billion, Qatar -- which controls 13 percent of global liquefied natural gas reserves -- is the richest country per capita in the world. You've likely also heard that the tiny statelet in the Gulf is hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which is generating controversy because of concerns about abusive working conditions for the immigrant labor force building its infrastructure. If you're interested in foreign affairs, you may know Qatar is home to the U.S. Air Force's command center for Middle East operations, or that it's played a key role in questioning old-school authoritarianism and supporting political Islam in the region. That's all important. But for this week, Qatar would like Americans to treat these facts as footnotes and focus instead on its generosity toward the U.S. during a time of national crisis 10 years ago.In a ceremony at the New Orleans Ritz Carlton on Thursday that attracted heavyweights like New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu and former Sen. Mary Landrieu, Qatari Ambassador Mohammed Jaham al Kuwari held ""a celebration of recovery."" The event, co-hosted by Habitat for Humanity and an array of corporate sponsors like ExxonMobil and Raytheon, commemorated Qatar's efforts to help the parts of the U.S. that were battered by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.Kuwari this month also launched a book documenting those efforts. Over more than 200 glossy pages, it features statistics and personal stories from Katrina victims who have benefited from Qatar's $100 million gift.Jauné Jackson is one example. ""I'd never heard of Qatar,"" she told the book's author, Scott Steedman. ""Now I know it's a very small country, and to hear that they just felt they had to do something to help us, it's amazing."" The Loyola grad grew up in New Orleans East, leaving home with her parents the day before the levees broke and living in a ""shotgun house"" with her parents, sisters and grandparents once she returned. Months later, when she finished high school and was preparing to attend college, she received a Qatar grant. Today, she produces the 5 p.m. broadcast at the New Orleans NBC affiliate.Among the narratives are tales of getting loans to buy a home for the first time and of establishing mobile medical units for mothers who might otherwise have had no access to prenatal care.""As heartbreaking images of destruction and displacement unfolded before our eyes, we felt the urge to act and help,"" Kuwari wrote in an op-ed for the New Orleans Times-Picayune that ran on Thursday. ""In the spirit of human solidarity, an Arab Gulf state was extending its hand to three American Gulf states. Eighteen projects were put in place in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi.""Qatar's then-ruler, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, set up a $100 million Qatar Katrina Fund two weeks after he observed chaos unfold in Katrina-struck regions. It has since funded 18 projects. Of the funds, $38.2 million went to education -- in the form of financial aid and scholarships for students from low-income backgrounds and investments at schools like Tulane and Loyola -- and $34.4 million to Habitat for Humanity, services for the homeless and housing loans. It also provided $27.4 million for covering care for the uninsured, among other health projects.""It was a mission of healing and revival, guided by a sense of duty, not charity. We believe that in every society, people have a right to live and prosper, not merely to survive,"" Kuwari wrote.Sheikh Hamad personally visited New Orleans in April 2008 to examine the impact his gift had. ""One of the world’s richest men toured one of America’s poorest cities on Tuesday,"" the New York Times reported at the time. ""Two universes peered at each other through the dark smoked glass of his motorcade."" During his visit, the former ruler stopped at Xavier University, the U.S.'s only historically black Catholic college. The Qatar Katrina Fund gave the university $17.5 million.On the anniversary of its gift, Qatar is working to ensure that its contribution isn't forgotten -- but to commemorate it in a way that causes less spectacle and drama than a monarch's speeding around a still-hurting city in a motorcade.Other countries, including Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the Qataris' regional rival, the United Arab Emirates, gave their share of support following Katrina too. Qatar says its contribution was the second-highest foreign donation. (The U.A.E. also gave $100 million, but its funds went straight to the federal government instead of to local partner organizations.)These donations come out of a mix of motives: altruism, certainly, but also a desire to show the U.S. that its relationships with the Arab world aren't simply about security or U.S. support for trusted partners -- they can go both ways. That's not always been a welcome message, particularly at times when Islamophobia has been ticking up, like after Sept. 11 or following the widely publicized atrocities of the Islamic State group.In packaging its legacy in New Orleans, then, Qatar is trying to hit the right notes: modesty, respect, compassion. The hope is that those themes will undercut skepticism about largely undemocratic Muslim countries with the level of wealth Qatar and other Arab states enjoy.""While hailed as the second-highest international donation, the Qatari gift was relatively modest compared to the damage done,"" Kuwari noted. ""Humanitarian aid is part and parcel of our culture and values. It is also a bridge for lasting friendship. Over the past decade, the Qatar–U.S. relations have only deepened.""Ten years on from Katrina, Qatar's ongoing focus on New Orleans is one part of making sure that continues."

She is finishing a conversation in which she learns her boyfriend was having an affair when her father died. She says she hates him, buries her face in her hands and demands to be left alone. Right when Moss' character seems devoid of energy, when a brief quiet has washed over the scene, she looks up. With a flash of devilish malaise, she unleashes a guttural ""Go!"" so terrifying it might as well shatter the screen. It is then that the title card announces ""Queen of Earth"" in blood-red cursive. The opening moments appear to signal a horrific drama surrounding a romantic relationship with a man. In fact, Moss' best-friend-turned-adversary is another woman, played by Katherine Waterston (""Inherent Vice"").The film, written and directed by Alex Ross Perry (""Listen Up Philip""), is about the disintegration of a years-long friendship. Moss told The Huffington Post that the movie was a treat to make because it was the first time she has been part of a female-dominated project, albeit a dark one. Told in the vein of the classic genre that Perry describes as ""psychotic-women cinema"" -- think ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" and Brian De Palma's ""Sisters"" with a touch of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and Woody Allen's ""Interiors"" -- ""Queen of Earth"" is an eerie look at the claustrophobia that sets in when childhood fixtures become relics. The relationship between her and Waterston's characters may be fraught, but it allowed for one of the most harmonious offscreen relations of Moss' career.""I work with men predominantly,"" the actress said. ""It's just different. I’m always the only girl. This was the first time that the main relationship in the film was with a woman. I have yet to have a really good relationship with a woman in film or in television, but it was a totally different dynamic offset for me. Katherine and I got along so great, and it was kind of awesome for me to be like, “Oh my God, there’s, like, a girl here!”In Perry's opinion, however, the reason Moss hasn't had pristine relationships with women onscreen is because she isn't attracted to such carefree storylines. It's a claim her résumé supports: Since breaking out on male-driven series ""The West Wing"" and ""Mad Men,"" Moss has played Jonah Hill's career-driven girlfriend in ""Get Him to the Greek,"" a neglected wife in ""On the Road,"" a troubled detective on ""Top of the Lake"" and one-half of a floundering couple in ""The One I Love."" Much of that work centers on emotional vulnerability, and that is precisely what ""Queen of Earth"" is about. Except now, Moss plays a character who isn't positioned largely among men. It's the horror-movie version of the road that often diverges in two friends' lives.When Catherine (Moss) and Ginny (Waterston) vacationed at the same Hudson Valley home the previous summer, Catherine's co-dependent romance made her blissful and unresponsive toward Ginny's bitterness.Now, the roles have reversed: Catherine is heartbroken and Ginny is reveling in flirtations with the boy next door (Patrick Fugit). But the relationship's fragmentation can't be pinned on the men who flit in and out of their lives. Intimate conversations, often portrayed via menacing closeups, reveal the deep-seated divisions that have cut through the friendship. It is the story of two confidants' inability to step outside of themselves to grapple with the downward spiral for which they blame each other. That springs to life through an urgency that resembles a thriller.""We could have made it a little bit of a looser, less piercing tone, but we really just went for it,"" Perry said. ""I said this movie could support a few moments where the foucs of the lens is on whoever’s listening, not whoever’s talking. In doing so, that will suggest a lot about this relationship if you’re watching these women react to one another instead of just watching what they're saying.""Perry, who will soon set sights on his first big-budget project by writing a live-action ""Winnie the Pooh"" update, employs restless camera techniques with precision. But he isn't interested in instilling fondness for the characters. Where ""Mad Men"" fans rooted for a Peggy-and-Joan union, no one watching the ""Queen of Earth"" characters self-destruct rests on any sense of hope for these women -- and the movie is all the most honest for it. Still, even though it's Moss' ""favorite"" movie she's done, she is looking forward to the day when the female rapport is as jovial onscreen as it was offscreen during the making of ""Queen of Earth."" ""I love those movies, like 'The Holiday,'"" Moss said. ""I need to make that kind of movie. I need to get into a Nancy Meyers film, stat.""""Queen of Earth"" is now open in limited release, with expansions planned throughout September.Also on HuffPost:For a constant stream of entertainment news and discussion, follow HuffPost Entertainment on Viber."

It said three trucks were involved.The Umhlanga Reed Dance has in the past involved bare-breasted young Swazi women dancing and singing in beaded mini-skirts to catch the eye of King Mswati III, Africa's last absolute monarch.The festival, meant to celebrate womanhood and virginity, is due to start on Saturday.Thousands of young women descend on the royal residence from all over the nation every year, but in a country where relatively few families own vehicles and where infrastructure is poor, many are squeezed onto open trucks.Neighboring South Africa, with better infrastructure, has one of the highest road death rates in the world according to the World Health Organisation."

And, Campbell said, they will collect video clips of their stories that she will try to get to the pope ahead of his visit. Campbell said she wants Francis to be able to hear from “folks that he wouldn’t otherwise be able to see, or hear from.”“That’s the theory,” she said. “I hope it works.”The bus will wind up in the nation’s capital just as the pontiff arrives for his highly anticipated six-day visit, his first to the U.S.On Sept. 23, the day after his arrival from a three-day visit to Cuba, Francis is to meet President Obama at the White House.The following day, Francis will address a joint meeting of Congress — a first for a pope — before heading to New York and then wrapping up his trip in Philadelphia on Sept. 27. There, he will celebrate an outdoor Mass that is expected to draw upwards of a million people.Campbell said she hoped to put the bus, a large charter wrapped with a distinctive logo and bright colors, somewhere that the pope could at least see it.“I asked the White House if we could park on Pennsylvania Avenue right outside the White House. That didn’t work,” she said with a laugh.Still, that Campbell and the nuns find themselves in sync with the pope is a remarkable change of fortune.In early 2012, the Vatican, then headed by Pope Benedict XVI, announced that its doctrinal office was launching an investigation and overhaul of the main leadership organization of the nation’s 50,000 nuns. The Vatican charged the nuns with straying from orthodoxy and promoting “certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith.”The Vatican also said the sisters of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, or LCWR, spent too much time on social justice causes — Campbell’s advocacy for health care reform, a long-standing priority for the Catholic Church in the U.S., was apparently especially troubling — and not enough time propounding church teachings on abortion and sexual morality.Rather than retreating in the face of the Vatican probe, the LCWR pushed back against the accusations, and buoyed by an outpouring of support from ordinary Catholics, Campbell and Network launched the first Nuns on the Bus tour in the summer of 2012 to focus on victims of the nation’s economic slowdown.It was a media sensation and was followed by two others, in 2013 and 2014, which highlighted the need for immigration reform and the problem of money in politics.Less than a year after that first tour, Benedict resigned, and Francis was elected pope. The first Latin American pontiff, Francis is deeply committed to advancing the church’s social justice doctrine, and he also moved to wind down the Vatican investigation of the LCWR, which formally ended in April with an olive branch to the sisters.“Obviously, Pope Francis’ message is exactly what we’ve been doing for 43 years,” Campbell said. “Having that affirmation is hugely supportive.”But, she added, “what’s important is that we continue to do the mission regardless of how it goes,” and whatever the hierarchy says.Also on HuffPost:"
15,LATINO VOICES,Want To Reduce Illegal Immigration? End The Drug War.,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/want-to-reduce-illegal-immigration-end-the-drug-war_us_55e0b5f7e4b0c818f617d3d1,The one way of stemming illegal immigration that Republicans aren't talking about.,2015-08-29,<p>Addressing drug war violence in Mexico and Central America will help curb illegal immigration into the U.S.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Several GOP presidential hopefuls have over the last few weeks offered wildly extreme and generally unrealistic proposals for deterring illegal immigration -- largely spurred by Donald Trump’s grandiose plan to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, then let a few of the “good ones” back in, all while building a giant, possibly self-branded border wall. Other ideas Republican primary candidates have pondered lately include eliminating birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th amendment to the Constitution, because some argue that it acts as a magnet for undocumented immigrants.While these ideas might energize the GOP’s conservative base, they wouldn’t do much to deter illegal immigration, for one simple reason: All of these propositions rest on the false assumption that most undocumented immigrants are crossing into the U.S. primarily to look for a better life and a higher-paying job. Anyone who speaks to undocumented immigrants regularly knows that they invariably view the dangerous and expensive trip into the U.S. as a last resort, usually because something went horribly wrong at home -- not because of dreams of having a child who is a U.S. citizen. Most of those who have crossed the southern border illegally over the last few years are not looking for work -- they’re fleeing violence in their home countries of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras. All four of these countries have experienced a sharp rise in drug-related violence, which is frequently deadly, over the last decade. In Mexico, for example, former President Felipe Calderón's frontal assault on the country’s cartels, continued by his successor Enrique Peña Nieto, has cost more than 100,000 lives, according to some estimates.For the last five years, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have topped the list of countries from which the U.S. receives the most asylum applications, and in the last year alone the number totaled nearly 120,000.When 68,000 unaccompanied minors, and a similar number of mothers traveling with children, crossed into the U.S. from Central America illegally, they generally didn’t disappear into the shadows, as the talking point goes. Most of them turned themselves in to border officials and asked for asylum or some other form of humanitarian relief. Those who manage to get access to a lawyer, which isn’t easy when you have no money and aren’t entitled to a public defender, usually win and are allowed to stay. The violence and intimidation that comes with the ongoing drug war drove the vast majority of these people from their homes. Some of the violence is spurred by warring cartels fighting to control the routes into the lucrative U.S. drug market. Other times, it's brutal street gangs that intimidate business owners and residents by forcing them to pay protection fees, and scare children into their ranks under the threat of death. Even government forces attack their own civilians, often with total impunity. The U.S. government has spent more than $2.3 billion fighting the drug war in Mexico over the last seven years, but rarely criticizes abuses committed by the security forces it finances. The ongoing violence could be greatly reduced tomorrow if the government halted its efforts to suppress the drug trade and stopped treating its own drug-using citizens like criminals. For conservatives, this plan has the added bonus of shrinking the size of government rather than ballooning it by billions of dollars -- as both Trump and slightly more moderate candidates in the Republican primary, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) propose to do.The drug war policy, which costs so many lives, has become increasingly absurd given the legalization of marijuana in many states. Consider for a moment that weed accounted for nearly 90 percent of the drugs seized on the U.S.-Mexico border from 2005 to 2011, according to an analysis by the Center for Investigative Reporting. Almost every time a Border Patrol official makes a drug bust, it’s to confiscate a drug that can be bought and sold legally today in Colorado and Washington. Oregon, the District of Columbia and Alaska have also passed legislation to allow the recreational use of weed. If the U.S. were to legalize marijuana across the entire country, Mexico’s cartels would lose a significant chunk of their profits.Legalizing the recreational use of marijuana should be a no-brainer for policymakers who are seriously concerned about national security and the integrity of our own criminal justice system. Public health concerns, however, make crafting policies that would eliminate the black market for other more harmful drugs less straightforward.Broad consensus exists, however, among leading Latin American voices of the left, right and center, that the focus should shift away from criminalizing users. They're urging governments “not to shy away from the transformative potential of regulation,” in the words of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, a group led by several former Latin American heads of state. As long as the violence continues in Mexico and Central America, people will continue to flee to the United States. Bigger border walls won’t do much to keep them from searching for safety. Ending the drug war will. "

He managed to snap a picture with the rattler around his neck, but when he tried to adjust it for a different pose it bit him on the thumb. ""I was going to take it off my neck and do something else with it, but it turned sideways, and it sunk its one tooth into my hand,"" Gomez told Los Angeles TV station KTLA in an interview from his sickbed.  Gomez dropped the snake and ran to a neighbor's house. He was rushed to a local hospital and received anti-venom treatment en route. His mother said her son could have died over a ""stupid"" stunt.“I’m shocked he would have that thing around his neck,” Debra Gomez told CBS Los Angeles. “It could’ve bit his neck and that would’ve been it.” It's possible Gomez will lose his thumb or never regain full use of his right hand. Gomez says he's learned a valuable lesson: ""Don't mess with snakes. Leave them alone.""In July, a San Diego man also tried to take a selfie with a rattlesnake. He wound up in the hospital with a bite on his arm and a $153,000 medical bill to show for it.Please don't take selfies with wild animals, especially venomous snakes. "
17,POLITICS,Why Bernie Sanders Is Best on Women's Issues,"Heather Gautney, ContributorSenior Researcher, 2016 Bernie Sanders Presidential Campaign, ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-womens-issues_b_8049572.html,Many people believe that electing a woman president will help. I'm not so sure. Does breaking glass ceilings constitute a real political strategy -- that's capable of improving women's lives? And does voting one's gender really translate to voting one's interest?,2015-08-29,"PHOENIX, AZ - JULY 18: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks to the crowd at the Phoenix Convention Center July 18, 2015 in Phoenix, Arizona. The Democratic presidential candidate spoke on his central issues of income inequality, job creation, controlling climate change, quality affordable education and getting big money out of politics, to more than 11,000 people attending. (Photo by Charlie Leight/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb90e972600002d0183cb5c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Women's issues are taking center stage in the lead-up to 2016. As they should: The conservative war on women's health and reproductive rights has raged on for far too long. And in all measures of social and political inequality, we remain what number-crunchers coolly term ""disproportionately affected.""Many people believe that electing a woman president will help. I'm not so sure. Does breaking glass ceilings constitute a real political strategy -- that's capable of improving women's lives? And does voting one's gender really translate to voting one's interest? Let's consider the issues:On women's right to choose, Republican state legislators from Florida to Oklahoma have concocted a series of procedural roadblocks to undermine Roe v. Wade--like mandatory waiting periods, ultrasounds, and ideologically-informed, ""counseling,"" some of which is medically unsound. In 2015 alone, they proposed more than 300 regulations restricting abortion in 45 states, and over the last four years, passed over 200 laws.Far from protecting women's health, as advocates claim, anti-choice laws drive up costs and reduce access, especially for women in vulnerable situations. They also drive up risks: Experts warn that drastic reductions in the number of abortion clinics in states like Texas and Alabama are likely to increase the numbers of dangerous, self-induced abortions.The Right's war on women has also targeted basic gynecological services that save millions of women's lives each year, like STD and breast-cancer screening. Fervent efforts by anti-abortion groups to delegitimize and defund Planned Parenthood -- alongside political battles over the Affordable Care Act to refuse birth control and emergency contraception -- are restricting access to much-needed health services, especially for low-income women. Bernie Sanders has consistently fought against Republican attacks on reproductive rights. If elected president, he would increase funding for Planned Parenthood. He's vowed to only nominate Supreme Court justices who uphold Roe v. Wade, and plans to expand women's health programs, and access to safe and legal abortions. Clinton has also been out front on reproductive rights, but her historic refrain that abortion be ""safe, legal, and rare"" has only served to stigmatize it and justify conservative efforts to impose legal restrictions.On the issue of families, Sanders has often pointed out that of 178 countries worldwide, the U.S. is one of three that does not provide new mothers with paid leave. He argues for a Scandinavia-like model, where family leave is part of a robust system of social safety nets. As president, he would provide workers with up 12 weeks of family and medical leave, funded with a small payroll contribution -- so that parents can bond with their newborns, and family members care for sick relatives. He would also free millions of women from the struggle to secure childcare by making high-quality services and pre-K available to all Americans, regardless of income.The Clinton campaign has made family leave a centerpiece of its platform, but the candidate's level of enthusiasm is not encouraging. Just last year she openly admitted to CNN, ""I don't think, politically, we could get it now.""In terms of income, most people know that women make only a fraction of what men earn (78 cents per dollar), and the numbers are much worse for blacks and Hispanics. Even women in labor unions, who enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining and workplace regulation, get only 88 cents to a man's dollar. Sanders has said that if elected he would sign the Paycheck Fairness Act to end wage discrimination based on gender. He would also increase the minimum wage to $15. Women account for more than half of those who would benefit from just a $10 increase, and they make up 72 percent of all tipped workers, who would also get a substantial raise. Clinton supports a $15 minimum, but only in her home state of New York. She's offering just $12 for everyone else. Even with decent wages, however, many Americans have spiraled into financial ruin from excessive medical costs. Women are especially afflicted, as we are less likely than men to be insured, and our healthcare expenses tend to be higher. While Clinton says she'll go with ""what works"" in Obamacare, Sanders' Medicare for All will help reduce out of pocket costs for lower income Americans. Along with expanded retirement benefits, universal healthcare can help eradicate these ruinous trends -- which are especially pronounced for elderly women, half of whom would sink into poverty without their Social Security checks. Finally, there's the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which promises to bring jobs, but mostly the kind that exploit poor women in the developing world. American women also stand to lose, as the TPP will enable corporations to outsource low-wage majority-female jobs (and some high-wage ones too). Clinton has been woolly on the TPP, most likely because her husband is among the world's premier trade liberalizers. Sanders, on the other hand, has spearheaded the opposition -- not just now, but back in the '90s against Bill Clinton's NAFTA, which cost American workers over one million jobs and put enormous downward pressure on their wages.In the end, it looks like the Senator from Vermont is outdoing the woman candidate on pro-woman policy. That shouldn't come as a surprise. A recent survey by the Ms. Foundation for Women found that ""Women do not lead single-issue lives... birth control and abortion is impacted by income level, racial and cultural bias, gender discrimination and immigrant status."" Bernie has long-understood that women's struggles can't be compartmentalized into issue-silos. That's why he's long-eschewed counterfeit gestures of ""gender diversity"" -- in favor of genuine social equality."

That decision puts the fate of the fragile Arctic Ocean, and a piece of our climate future, in the hands of Shell - a company with a track record of stumbles and mishaps in the Arctic that hardly inspires confidence.To put this decision into context, it's important to understand the climate legacy President Obama has sought to put into place for himself. Obama's climate policy was born of a commitment to acting on climate change for the sake of future generations, a commitment seemingly at odds with green-lighting the drilling for and burning of the billions of barrels of oil currently locked up beneath the Chukchi Sea.Just last month, in more than 20 events across 15 states, citizens across the country banded together in a nationwide protest calling on President Obama to stop Shell - or any other oil company - from drilling in the Arctic Ocean. And one of the most compelling voices from that day of action came from the ""future generations"" that President Obama is seeking to protect - our kids and grandkids, who will bear the brunt of climate change should we continue down our current road of fossil fuel dependence.Bella Parra, all of 11 years old, stood among her peers a stone's throw away from Lake Michigan in Chicago - President Obama's hometown - and spoke out about Arctic drilling:Hi, my name is Bella Parra, daughter of Barbara Klipp, and I (like all of you) strongly dislike Shell's plans for our future! When my mom told me that Shell was planning to drill in the Arctic, I got so mad. Two times I went to Washington, D.C., for Alaska Wilderness Week and I learned so much about Alaska and wildlife. We learned about indigenous people, caribou, polar bears, and all kinds of ocean animals like whales and lots more. I probably learned more there than I learn in school.

Iconic species like walrus, polar bears and bowhead whales are already being impacted by the disappearance of Arctic ice and other long term impacts from climate change, and now will be subjected to disturbances from Shell's drilling program as well.Whatever happens this summer, the world will be watching. Millions of Americans have come forward to save the Arctic from both climate disaster and the potential for devastating spills -- but this fight is just beginning.Five years on from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster, and wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico continues to suffer.

Discovering Your Ultimate Orga...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-one-lesbian-power-cou_b_8034982.html,"""I've adjusted my outlook on work. I still love it, but it can't be the only thing in my life.""",2015-08-29,2015-08-25-1440473610-1852192-ScreenShot20150824at10.32.10PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-08-25-1440473610-1852192-ScreenShot20150824at10.32.10PM-thumb.png,"Last year I had the pleasure of interviewing an inspiring lesbian couple based in Portland, OR -- Carrie Welch and her wife Jannie Huang. Welch is the Co-Founder of Feast, Portland's annual kick ass festival of food and drink and Huang is the Creative Director of the now beloved event. Along with putting on Feast (with co-founder Mike Thelin), the two also run a fun and funky PR firm called Little Green Pickle. And, when I spoke to them last year, they had just recently welcomed a new baby boy into their lives. Needless to say, this past year has been a little different from the last. These two continue to be one of my favorite lesbian power couples. So I was curious to see how things have gone since baby made three...How would you characterize this year as compared to last? Carrie - Well! It's been quite a year. I remember feeling like we were on the precipice of a huge change last year going into Feast. Taylor had just been born, and life was feeling crazy, painful (after an unplanned C-section) and just wild trying to do the festival and get to know this incredible little being we'd brought into the world. The reality of that didn't set in for a few months. Feast last year is a total blur for me -- there are so many parts I remember clearly and so many I don't remember at all.This year is a different year for so many reasons. We have a new, extremely talented team at Feast. These ladies are getting it done and then some. I am so proud of the strides we've made and that we've updated our Saturday night event, Smoked! and sold it out earlier than any other year. This is also the year before our 5th year, so we are actively planning next year at the same time. It feels sophisticated and less start up, though we all still have our hands in everything. I'm excited to use this year as a warm up to continue to surprise people with what we can do in year 5.Jannie - Way less hectic. We are not the brand spankin' newbie parents. Granted we still have so much to learn, but at least we have a system or sort of schedule with Taylor. Plus my wife is the best partner to raise our son with. What's been the hardest adjustment you've had to make?Carrie - What hasn't been adjusted is probably more accurate! I used to be a corporate gal -- in at 9am, leaving at 6, 7pm or later. I LOVE to work. I have worked since I was 15 years old; my first job was as a waitress at Denny's and since then I've always been motivated to get things done. My parents owned their own business working out of our house growing up and I imagine that had some kind of osmosis impact on me.I've adjusted my outlook on work. I still love it, but it can't be the only thing in my life. I do what a lot of working moms do -- I leave the office at 4:30pm so I can relieve the nanny, I work from home with Taylor Mondays and Wednesdays, I check my phone a lot, I work furiously and as efficiently as possible on his naps (luckily he's a great sleeper so far), I work late at night. You find ways to make it all happen, and you're that much more motivated because you want to be with your son too.Jannie: Not being with Taylor every day and going to work four and half days a week. I'm sure you got all kinds of advice from all kinds of people are balancing work and a new baby, what was the best piece of advice you received?Carrie - Don't worry about being perfect. Be yourself as a parent. Don't give in to mom peer pressure on what you should be doing, what you're missing, what other parents and kids are doing. Go your own way and figure it out. Because really, when it comes down to it, that's what all parents are doing. These beautiful children, where everything they do is magic, are everything and we're all just trying to do the right stuff for them. A reporter friend emailed me a list of parenting tips when I was pregnant, which was only slightly overwhelming because when you're pregnant, the thought of actually parenting is so foreign, you're just trying to move your big body around... Or at least that's how it was for me. And it wasn't even what the tips were, it was that people are thinking about you, wanting to help you, reassuring you that yes it's going to be crazy hard but crazy beautiful and you bond with others in a way you never have before. The best advice has been don't judge, do your own thing and support each other in this parenting game! Jannie - Read Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Baby by Marc Weissbluth M.D. Cry it out. It's not for everyone, but it's the number one reason we have been able to get some sleep, be awake to play with him and get everything done! He is on a regular sleep schedule and that allows us to sleep a little more than most parents. What has surprised you the most about being a new mom?Carrie - How much I wholeheartedly, without question love it. I was never one of those I-have-to-be-a-mother people. I knew I'd have kids, but I wasn't really hot on it until my mid-thirties. I am surprised every day how much this little man makes me fall in love with him over and over again. Now I can't imagine life without him. How he adds so much to our lives and how much more perspective on the world I feel I have now. I know a lot of people say these things, and they seem corny or trite, but they are totally true. Jannie - How much I could love a human being. They say you can love your kid, but this is more than I ever expected. My heart melts every time I come home to my family. My family means the world to me and there is nothing I wouldn't do for them. Do you feel like being a new mom has informed how you do business in a new way in any respect?Carrie - Yes, I am a big softie now. The other day I actually pulled my car over because a spider was struggling on my window, and I got out to be sure it made it to the grass. A woman and her young son were asking for money on the street in Downtown Portland last night as Jannie and I were leaving dinner. The hardened New Yorker in me would never have given them money, but now I gave them $5 because it doesn't matter. If it was a scam, if they really needed it - it doesn't matter. That's a woman and her son out there and I needed to help.In business, I think I am more patient. Not totally patient but more than I used to be. Once you've been through birth many thing seem a lot easier! I try to understand more where people are coming from, listen and then decide what to do. Some of this comes from living in Portland for five years too!Jannie - I have a completely new respect for working parents, single moms and single dads. I do not know how they do it. Carrie and I have a hard enough time doing it together let alone doing it on our own. We make sure we make time for him first. No phones when we play with him. Utilize the time when he is sleeping. We don't dwell on the little things anymore. He has really helped us realize what's important and it's okay that person cut me off on the highway. What is the one thing you wish you had known before having a baby?Carrie - How hard it really is. It's what people always say, but it's a reality. It's hard in unexpected ways. You are now responsible for another life and there's a ton of feelings and emotions and logistics that go with that all day every day. You can't watch TV or movies about children in the same way again. I turn the channel when they have the stories about children in hot cars and things like that. You have completely new worst fears in your life that you never knew were possible. You understand how other parents feel in almost any situation with just a glance or a nod. It's enlightening and you see why we have children, but it's also terrifying on a daily basis. The comfort comes when your baby curls that little arm around your neck when you're holding him and you know everything is going to be ok.Jannie - I wish we saved even more than I planned on and started looking for nannies/daycare as soon as you can! We had no plan, but we got lucky and found an amazing nanny. Even though you live in what I would call a pretty LGBTQ-friendly city, would you say you've faced any challenges in terms of being lesbian moms?Carrie - Not yet. I took Taylor to the science museum here in Portland last week -- it's ridiculously kid-friendly and they have a great space for crawlers. He sat up on his hind legs and started screaming at the top of his lungs, ""Da Da Da Da!"" And I realized that I'm going to have to get good at explaining that there was a sperm donor and yes there is no ""father"" and no that's not how we refer to it, we call it a donor and there was a sperm and an egg and a doctor's office... Right now Jannie and I are enjoying the time before he can ask all of those questions and everyone we encounter in Portland just loves him to pieces. He's an outgoing boy and so far so good.Jannie - Hearing ""What color was the father's hair?"" When we first started the fertility process we were required to go through a counseling session. Don't worry, it's for straight people too. They teach us to say donor sperm, not the father. And now I know why. What are some Feast favorites that returning Feast-goers can look forward to?Carrie - Two of my favorite events are always the Sandwich Invitational (Thursday, 9/17) and the Oregon Bounty Grand Tasting (Friday 9/18 and Saturday 9/19). Feast is a big festival, but these events feel really laid back. The Sandwich Invitational is sandwiches and beer under the stars in Director Park in Downtown Portland. This is a good example of how our events have a real sense of place -- you know you're in Portland and feel like you're in the center of it all. Widmer Brothers Brewing are brewing four new beers for us this year and the sandwiches are outrageous and awesome so you can't lose at that event.At the Oregon Bounty Grand Tasting, this is THE gathering of the up-and-coming makers who are doing cool ass stuff around the state and beyond. Jacobsen Salt Co., Bee Local Honey and new guys like Red Duck Ketchup, Pitch Dark Chocolate and Eliot's Adult Nut Butters are all going to be there sampling, plus the best Oregon wines and beers. The wine tent is a best kept secret -- you can try the tipity top reserve wines from Oregon's award-winning wineries and it's part of your all inclusive ticket.Jannie - Oregon Bounty Grand Tasting. It's the lowest cost ticket and this year there is a new format. You'll have to buy tickets to find out!  What are some surprises that Feast-goers can look forward to?Carrie - We reimagined our panels this year and the Drink Tank discussions you'll see this year are bigger, badder and more fun than ever. One I want to see and that I know will be full of surprises is the Bon Appetit Shaken, Stirred and Buzzed: Why We Really Like Booze. Why do we really like booze? I have my theories, but I'd rather hear Bon App's!Also the fire dancers at the Night Market weren't wearing underwear last year. Just sayin'... Jannie - What the Smoked! event will look like. Our director, Emily Crowley, and team, has gone above and beyond to make this one look amazing. The food and drinks will be incredible! What advice do you have entrepreneurs with brand new editions?Carrie - I'm thankful every day we run our own businesses. It can be a blessing and a curse as you set your own schedule so you can work whenever you want, which usually means you're working all the time. I don't mind that part because I love what I do and I want to work. My advice would be do what you have to do for your family and make the work, well, work. I have drawn more boundaries between work and life than I ever have before and I think that's an important part of it. I leave when I have to and I don't apologize or feel bad about it. You have to live your actual life and be with your child. That is paramount, and if your child sees that you're happy and successful in your work, then it's a positive all around.Jannie - Set up your team! We couldn't have done it without the Little Green Pickle team and Feast Portland team. They are like family and we have been lucky to work with such amazing people. Enjoy every moment. From working in the late night hours to waking up to the cutest smile in the world. You'll figure it out as it comes. Don't worry too much. It always works out! Will the little man be making an appearance or two at Feast?Carrie - Most likely! Last year he was two weeks old and he circled the Sandwich Invitational and Oregon Bounty Grand Tasting because no one, I mean no one, can bring babies and strollers into Feast Portland -- even me! This year, I think he'll make a brief appearance, say hi to his fans and then get back to trying to open all those kitchen cabinets.Jannie - Unfortunately, no kids allowed at the events. But you may see him at the entrance or strolling around town!"

I'm excited to use this year as a warm up to continue to surprise people with what we can do in year 5.Jannie - Way less hectic. We are not the brand spankin' newbie parents. Granted we still have so much to learn, but at least we have a system or sort of schedule with Taylor. Plus my wife is the best partner to raise our son with. What's been the hardest adjustment you've had to make?Carrie - What hasn't been adjusted is probably more accurate! I used to be a corporate gal -- in at 9am, leaving at 6, 7pm or later. I LOVE to work. I have worked since I was 15 years old; my first job was as a waitress at Denny's and since then I've always been motivated to get things done. My parents owned their own business working out of our house growing up and I imagine that had some kind of osmosis impact on me.I've adjusted my outlook on work. I still love it, but it can't be the only thing in my life. I do what a lot of working moms do -- I leave the office at 4:30pm so I can relieve the nanny, I work from home with Taylor Mondays and Wednesdays, I check my phone a lot, I work furiously and as efficiently as possible on his naps (luckily he's a great sleeper so far), I work late at night. You find ways to make it all happen, and you're that much more motivated because you want to be with your son too.Jannie: Not being with Taylor every day and going to work four and half days a week. I'm sure you got all kinds of advice from all kinds of people are balancing work and a new baby, what was the best piece of advice you received?Carrie - Don't worry about being perfect. Be yourself as a parent. Don't give in to mom peer pressure on what you should be doing, what you're missing, what other parents and kids are doing. Go your own way and figure it out. Because really, when it comes down to it, that's what all parents are doing. These beautiful children, where everything they do is magic, are everything and we're all just trying to do the right stuff for them. A reporter friend emailed me a list of parenting tips when I was pregnant, which was only slightly overwhelming because when you're pregnant, the thought of actually parenting is so foreign, you're just trying to move your big body around... Or at least that's how it was for me. And it wasn't even what the tips were, it was that people are thinking about you, wanting to help you, reassuring you that yes it's going to be crazy hard but crazy beautiful and you bond with others in a way you never have before. The best advice has been don't judge, do your own thing and support each other in this parenting game! Jannie - Read Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Baby by Marc Weissbluth M.D. Cry it out. It's not for everyone, but it's the number one reason we have been able to get some sleep, be awake to play with him and get everything done! He is on a regular sleep schedule and that allows us to sleep a little more than most parents. What has surprised you the most about being a new mom?Carrie - How much I wholeheartedly, without question love it. I was never one of those I-have-to-be-a-mother people. I knew I'd have kids, but I wasn't really hot on it until my mid-thirties. I am surprised every day how much this little man makes me fall in love with him over and over again. Now I can't imagine life without him. How he adds so much to our lives and how much more perspective on the world I feel I have now. I know a lot of people say these things, and they seem corny or trite, but they are totally true. Jannie - How much I could love a human being. They say you can love your kid, but this is more than I ever expected. My heart melts every time I come home to my family. My family means the world to me and there is nothing I wouldn't do for them. Do you feel like being a new mom has informed how you do business in a new way in any respect?Carrie - Yes, I am a big softie now. The other day I actually pulled my car over because a spider was struggling on my window, and I got out to be sure it made it to the grass. A woman and her young son were asking for money on the street in Downtown Portland last night as Jannie and I were leaving dinner. The hardened New Yorker in me would never have given them money, but now I gave them $5 because it doesn't matter. If it was a scam, if they really needed it - it doesn't matter. That's a woman and her son out there and I needed to help.In business, I think I am more patient. Not totally patient but more than I used to be. Once you've been through birth many thing seem a lot easier! I try to understand more where people are coming from, listen and then decide what to do. Some of this comes from living in Portland for five years too!Jannie - I have a completely new respect for working parents, single moms and single dads. I do not know how they do it. Carrie and I have a hard enough time doing it together let alone doing it on our own. We make sure we make time for him first. No phones when we play with him. Utilize the time when he is sleeping. We don't dwell on the little things anymore. He has really helped us realize what's important and it's okay that person cut me off on the highway. What is the one thing you wish you had known before having a baby?Carrie - How hard it really is. It's what people always say, but it's a reality. It's hard in unexpected ways. You are now responsible for another life and there's a ton of feelings and emotions and logistics that go with that all day every day. You can't watch TV or movies about children in the same way again. I turn the channel when they have the stories about children in hot cars and things like that. You have completely new worst fears in your life that you never knew were possible. You understand how other parents feel in almost any situation with just a glance or a nod. It's enlightening and you see why we have children, but it's also terrifying on a daily basis. The comfort comes when your baby curls that little arm around your neck when you're holding him and you know everything is going to be ok.Jannie - I wish we saved even more than I planned on and started looking for nannies/daycare as soon as you can! We had no plan, but we got lucky and found an amazing nanny. Even though you live in what I would call a pretty LGBTQ-friendly city, would you say you've faced any challenges in terms of being lesbian moms?Carrie - Not yet. I took Taylor to the science museum here in Portland last week -- it's ridiculously kid-friendly and they have a great space for crawlers. He sat up on his hind legs and started screaming at the top of his lungs, ""Da Da Da Da!"" And I realized that I'm going to have to get good at explaining that there was a sperm donor and yes there is no ""father"" and no that's not how we refer to it, we call it a donor and there was a sperm and an egg and a doctor's office... Right now Jannie and I are enjoying the time before he can ask all of those questions and everyone we encounter in Portland just loves him to pieces. He's an outgoing boy and so far so good.Jannie - Hearing ""What color was the father's hair?"" When we first started the fertility process we were required to go through a counseling session. Don't worry, it's for straight people too. They teach us to say donor sperm, not the father. And now I know why. What are some Feast favorites that returning Feast-goers can look forward to?Carrie - Two of my favorite events are always the Sandwich Invitational (Thursday, 9/17) and the Oregon Bounty Grand Tasting (Friday 9/18 and Saturday 9/19). Feast is a big festival, but these events feel really laid back. The Sandwich Invitational is sandwiches and beer under the stars in Director Park in Downtown Portland. This is a good example of how our events have a real sense of place -- you know you're in Portland and feel like you're in the center of it all. Widmer Brothers Brewing are brewing four new beers for us this year and the sandwiches are outrageous and awesome so you can't lose at that event.At the Oregon Bounty Grand Tasting, this is THE gathering of the up-and-coming makers who are doing cool ass stuff around the state and beyond. Jacobsen Salt Co., Bee Local Honey and new guys like Red Duck Ketchup, Pitch Dark Chocolate and Eliot's Adult Nut Butters are all going to be there sampling, plus the best Oregon wines and beers. The wine tent is a best kept secret -- you can try the tipity top reserve wines from Oregon's award-winning wineries and it's part of your all inclusive ticket.Jannie - Oregon Bounty Grand Tasting. It's the lowest cost ticket and this year there is a new format. You'll have to buy tickets to find out!  What are some surprises that Feast-goers can look forward to?Carrie - We reimagined our panels this year and the Drink Tank discussions you'll see this year are bigger, badder and more fun than ever. One I want to see and that I know will be full of surprises is the Bon Appetit Shaken, Stirred and Buzzed: Why We Really Like Booze. Why do we really like booze? I have my theories, but I'd rather hear Bon App's!Also the fire dancers at the Night Market weren't wearing underwear last year. Just sayin'... Jannie - What the Smoked! event will look like. Our director, Emily Crowley, and team, has gone above and beyond to make this one look amazing. The food and drinks will be incredible! What advice do you have entrepreneurs with brand new editions?Carrie - I'm thankful every day we run our own businesses. It can be a blessing and a curse as you set your own schedule so you can work whenever you want, which usually means you're working all the time. I don't mind that part because I love what I do and I want to work. My advice would be do what you have to do for your family and make the work, well, work. I have drawn more boundaries between work and life than I ever have before and I think that's an important part of it. I leave when I have to and I don't apologize or feel bad about it. You have to live your actual life and be with your child. That is paramount, and if your child sees that you're happy and successful in your work, then it's a positive all around.Jannie - Set up your team! We couldn't have done it without the Little Green Pickle team and Feast Portland team. They are like family and we have been lucky to work with such amazing people. Enjoy every moment. From working in the late night hours to waking up to the cutest smile in the world. You'll figure it out as it comes. Don't worry too much. It always works out! Will the little man be making an appearance or two at Feast?Carrie - Most likely! Last year he was two weeks old and he circled the Sandwich Invitational and Oregon Bounty Grand Tasting because no one, I mean no one, can bring babies and strollers into Feast Portland -- even me! This year, I think he'll make a brief appearance, say hi to his fans and then get back to trying to open all those kitchen cabinets.Jannie - Unfortunately, no kids allowed at the events. But you may see him at the entrance or strolling around town!"

That's how many people were left in New Orleans post-Katrina. After the diaspora, each of them became a city unto themselves. And each has lived a lifetime in the last 10 years.",2015-08-29,"PORT SULPHUR, LA - SEPTEMBER 11: An American flag hangs in a pile of debris after Hurricane Katrina passed through September 11, 2005 in Port Sulphur, Louisiana. Most of the homes throughout the Plaquemines parish are destroyed or heavily damaged. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5cafd2400005100980525.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"1) I live on the first floor, so there would be no point.  Pre-Katrina my husband Jeff and I lived on the second floor. Then we lived in Illinois, second floor again, while my parents both succumbed to the long goodbye of Alzheimer's Disease. Then we shared a house with Dr. John while everybody was making it back to the city. Now we live in the French Quarter in a Creole cottage that I leave as little as possible. Having the bottom drop out of life turns you into a couch-hugger once you find a couch that tends to remain in place. It's a long story. 2) The stories from New Orleans still need to be told. New Orleans is a tale of 200,000 cities. That's how many people were left in New Orleans post-Katrina. After the diaspora, each of them became a city unto themselves. And each has lived a lifetime in the last 10 years. Heartbreak and suicide was epidemic in the first years of returnees, and we've all been to far too many funerals, as joyous as a New Orleans funeral can become. But there's a new wave. New Orleans has experienced a youthquake of transplants and their accompanying gentrification, and the zeitgeist of this city takes years to understand, if you ever really do. Storytelling is a part of sharing that legacy. In the last two days I've heard buskers playing both The Carpenters and The Eagles. If our stories don't get out there, forget about hearing Danny Barker's 'You Gotta Get Yourself a Job Girl"" or Huey Piano Smith's ""I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say"" on any given Saturday stroll. 3) After 10 years, thanks must be given. It's not possible to list how many people reached out to help New Orleans in the last 10 years. On 8/30/2005 Jeff wanted to help the musicians he had played with his whole life knowing that they, and possibly we, had lost everything. I remember trying to talk him out of it from a hotel room in Chicago. It seemed like something more people would do if it was possible. But he remained undeterred and we hit the road for The New Orleans Musicians Relief Fund. We couldn't come home for months, and it helped to think of someone beside yourself. Wilco played a benefit in Chicago that funded the first major grants and our charity kicked into action.4) No, really. People are wonderful. Even once the recession, BP Oil Spill and what has felt like a never-ending series of disasters hit, instruments never stopped coming. Grand pianos, violins, trombones, trumpets, drum sets, percussion for kids, keyboards, guitars, guitar stands, marching band drums, band uniforms, a band car, a second car when the first car was stolen, housing, gig clothes, an Italian concertina for Johnny Sansone who's so big he made it look like a thimble ... to this day I am in awe of the generosity of spirit that met New Orleans in its darkest days. Last year a donor found a rare French clarinet in his Bourbon Street attic. It may not have been played in 100 years. Brilliant New Orleans clarinetist Rickey Paulin accepted it, and it's being restored. As he said, ""I've GOT to play that thing!""5) Music helps get you through anything. Endless Katrina footage getting you down? Listen to songs about it instead. Two years into New Orleans recovery, musicians donated tracks to ReDefine 8/29. Everyone from R.E.M. with a live track to the dB's to New Orleans' own James Andrews. Upon the compilation of national and international songs of recovery's release, David Fricke of Rolling Stone gave it a four star review. Our local heroes often go unsung, so I've always been proud of Jeff for finding so many Katrina songs that resonated. The download tracks have reverted back to the original artists, but you can hear it on WHIV-FM on 8/29 at 1 p.m. Central. 6) The coverage - there is just so much of it.  There's been more long-form Katrina coverage in the last month as there had been in the previous 10 years. Schools, music, food, wetlands, population, -- if the saturation from the Katrina 10-year is from some kind of mass media survivor's guilt for not writing about the city in, say, years 3, 6, 8 or any odd year, I'll take it. Memes have been blown up, clumsy narratives imploded, numbers have been crunched. I can't imagine the dent in legacy media and web site budgets from the blanket coverage of the last week, especially in this era of slim media margins. As much as I complain about getting the Katranniversary yips, I'm grateful for the deep dive into the state of the city that not everyone thought was worth saving. Turns out it saved itself.7) After Saturday, there's another 10 year break. So see you back in New Orleans for Katrina 20, national media. In the meantime, the stories never end.Lagniappe: How's Your House by Ian Hunter, Video Grewvia for NOMRF: "

As the New York Times reports on August 24, candidate Jeb has finally come out swinging at provocations from his Republican rivals.Contrary to tough-guy Jeb Bush, I would not leave the door open to torture, not even for use against those U.S. officials who, post 9/11, secretly conceived and implemented torture in our foreign policy. Experts now agree that torture does not produce credible intelligence. It is also immoral and illegal. Torture defiles those who undertake it and taints all Americans in whose names it has been committed.Its practice should not be on the table at presidential debates. U.S. representatives responsible for opening, and carrying out, this Pandora's box should be tried for war crimes, as William Cheng deftly summarizes.With a possible remake in development, it's time to wrestle again with past Bush presidencies.The current chaos in the Middle East lies at the feet of America's interventionist neoconservatives. Dick Cheney et al seem to have taken inspiration from the La Fontaine maxim that ""might makes right."" With a dash of Tony Stark's desire to carry on his father's ""unfinished"" work, George W. Bush went along with his consiglieri's suicidal policies.Many journalists, anti-war protesters, and experts predicted the political void that would open if the U.S. toppled the secular nationalist Saddam Hussein. Extremism loves a vacuum. Having failed to conquer Al-Qaeda, the Bush regime created a void in the Middle East lately filled by ISIS, another group that doesn't rule out torture. But few predicted the U.S.'s scandalous embrace of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" (read ""torture""), now depressingly catalogued in countless books and documentary films.Could it possibly be that a Bush III administration will revive the use of torture against the Islamic state, an organization that owes its existence to the U.S.'s disastrous occupation of Iraq? And so our country prepares to wrong the wrongs of the past.Beginning in 2002, I started researching Arab cinema, eventually traveling to North Africa to learn what filmmakers from Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco had to say about the so-called ""clash of civilizations,"" the invasion of Iraq, and the Middle East generally.Deeply bi-cultural, educated Tunisians speak French as fluently as Arabic, and understand the French Enlightenment as well as the history of the Ottoman empire. Among the most liberal of their Arab brethren, Tunisians - in private then highly critical of their own totalitarian government - complained bitterly about Saudi Arabia's exportation of Islamic extremism throughout their region and the world.18 months after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, I attended the Carthage Film Festival in Tunis, then the largest festival of Arab cinema in the world. A taxi cab driver from the airport told me, ""Saddam is a bastard, but he's our bastard."" Tunisian filmmakers mused that if the U.S. really wanted to promote democracy in the Arab world, then it should have invaded Tunisia. A progressive, secular middle-class country, Tunisia held the most promise for a representative government à la Turkey. Tunisia is not a cookie-cutter country assembled by colonial powers. It has been a coherent nation-state for hundreds of years. In addition, the police state of dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali routinely tortured its political opponents.In 2006, I again attended the Carthage festival. In the ongoing mayhem of the occupation of Iraq, Tunisian and Arab directors, producers, and critics remained stupefied by the 2004 election of G.W. Bush as president. Ok, they said, the Republicans stole the 2000 election, these things happen in the Middle East as well.In 2016, history risks repeating itself, first as tragedy, now as farce. For those who have been paying attention - and I know it's hard with Donald trumping around - Jeb Bush has quietly assembled a group of foreign policy advisors. 19 of 21 come from his father's or his brother's administrations (including Paul Wolfowitz, the ""architect"" of the American war in Iraq), opening wide the possibility of further adventurism in the Middle East.Candidate Bush now walks a thin red line between owning and disowning the finally unpopular war in Iraq, wanting to have his torture cake and eat it, too. Do politicians who endorse torture actually imagine what it entails? Why won't a Republican presidential candidate step forward to publicly undergo waterboarding, as did journalist Christopher Hitchens, or nudity, slapping, humiliation, sleep deprivation, and hanging from ceiling, all disgracefully used by the CIA in tandem with complicit governments abroad?In 2014, our Senate produced a report demonstrating that, 1) the U.S. use of torture was more brutal than previously admitted; 2) the CIA lied about its use of torture; and 3) torture failed to produce intelligence that saved lives. Utilized during the Spanish Inquisition, waterboarding, like all forms of torture, has been denounced by Pope Francis as ""a mortal sin."" As is painfully clear in America today, torture rots the body politic that permits it.Of resuscitating torture techniques that contravene the codes of the Geneva Convention, candidate Bush says that ""now we're in a different environment."" If elected, Jeb promises to take us back to the shameful policies of the new millennium, when the U.S. regressed to an ""eye for an eye"" method of its enemies. With a Bush around the corner, one could say that, as Faulkner put it, ""the past is never dead. It's not even past.""Is the American public really ready for a Bush family dynasty to rival the Saudis? Fool us once, shame on you, fool us thrice....If you think Bush II was bad, don't hold your breath for the sequel, or you may find yourself underwater.Jeffrey Ruoff is an associate professor of Film and Media Studies at Dartmouth College and OpEd Project Public Voices Fellow."
