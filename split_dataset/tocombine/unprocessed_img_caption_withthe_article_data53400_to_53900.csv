0,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton And Donald Trump Skip National Gathering Of Latino Leaders,Jacquie Lee and Liz Adetiba,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-naleo_us_576c40dbe4b017b379f55448,"""It makes me wonder, are they taking the Latino vote for granted?""",2016-06-23,"Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton didn't show up to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials' conference on Thursday, despite speaking at the event in Las Vegas last year.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576c44bc2200002e00f82a70.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) headlined a major gathering of Latino elected officials Thursday, hitting his usual talking points of immigration reform, economic issues and education. But what made this year’s National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials conference unusual was not what was said but who was missing -- namely, presumptive presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This is the first time in three presidential election cycles that the presumptive nominees from the two major parties haven’t shown up to the gathering. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R), and President Barack Obama have all spoken at the NALEO annual conference during their presidential campaigns, and Clinton spoke at the conference last year in Las Vegas. Sanders and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential nominee, addressed this year’s NALEO crowd. The Trump and Clinton campaigns did not return a request for comment on why the candidates didn't attend. Next month, Clinton is scheduled to address the annual convention for the League of United Latin American Citizens, which is one of the nation's oldest Latino civil rights groups. For many attendees, Trump's absence was a welcome development. Anti-immigrant rhetoric is a central part of Trump's campaign. On the day he announced his candidacy, he referred to Mexican immigrants as ""killers"" and “rapists."" More recently, he took heat from members of his own party for questioning the impartiality of a judge who happened to be Mexican-American.“I'm glad [Donald Trump] didn't come,” said Jeronimo Saldana, a staffer for the nonprofit Drug Policy Action, which focuses on drug law reform. “But I wish there would've been some acknowledgment [from him] of this conference.""Veronica Lauria, a board member at California’s Valle Lindo School District, agreed. “I wouldn't want to be in the same hotel as him,"" she said.But not everyone shared their sentiment. Robert Gallegos, a Democratic district council member in Houston, didn’t expect Trump to show for the convention, but said he would have respected the effort. “If he does show I’ll give him a little credit,” he said. “I’d like to hear his explanation for the rhetoric he’s been blasting out there as far as the Latinos and Mexicans ... there’s anger, you know.” Clinton’s absence, however, shook Hispanic leaders, some of whom saw it as a sign that she might not fight for Latino voters. “Unfortunately it’s disappointing to not see Secretary Clinton here and/or Republican candidate Trump,” said Art Fierro, trustee chair for El Paso Community College. “It makes me wonder, are they taking the Latino vote for granted?”Over 13 million Latinos are registered to vote in November, a 17 percent increase from 2012. With the Hispanic population rapidly rising in the United States, securing the Latino vote becomes more important every election cycle. Arturo Vargas, NALEO’s executive director, believes that Clinton, who has been accused of pandering to the Hispanic community (or “hispandering”), has now lost an opportunity to genuinely engage with the Latino community. Lauria agrees. “What would half an hour of her time have taken for her to be here, and show up for Latinos?” Lauria, asked. “Over 1,000 Latinos are here, so what would it have taken for her to be here, or tweet something?""Frustration with Clinton also spilled over to the Democratic National Committee, with some attendees upset that they aren't getting enough support in down-ballot races. “The DNC I don’t think is doing enough in Texas in regards to getting Democrats elected,” Gallegos said. “[If you] put more funding in the Texas Democratic Party to elect down-ballot candidates in November that would be a big step in the right direction, especially in this election when you have Hillary and Donald Trump.”“We're looking at six to seven races where potentially we could pick up seats as Democrats in Texas,” Texas state Rep. Justin Rodriguez (D) said. “But now that primaries are behind us, ramping that up in the summer going into the fall is going to be crucial.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The city switched back in October.The river water was more corrosive than the Detroit system's and caused more lead to leach from aging pipes. Lead can be toxic, and children are especially vulnerable. The crisis has prompted lawsuits by parents who say their children have shown dangerously high levels of lead in their blood.The EPA, which worked in coordination with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the testing, said properly filtered water is safe even for pregnant and nursing women, and children, groups more susceptible to the effects of lead poisoning.""Residents can be confident that they can use filtered water and protect their developing fetus or young child from lead,"" U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary Dr. Nicole Lurie said in a statement. Lurie has led federal support efforts for the Flint crisis.The EPA said the filters distributed by the state of Michigan effectively remove lead or reduce it to levels well below the level of 15 parts per billion at which federal officials say action is needed. In the testing, nearly all filtered water tested below 1 part per billion. In January, water samples tested above 150 parts per billion.The state began offering free water filters in Flint in January.""This good news shows the progress we are making with overall water quality improving in Flint,"" Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said in a statement.Snyder has been criticized for the state's poor handling of the crisis.Flint Mayor Karen Weaver noted that some homes have faucets where the filters do not fit. ""This is not the ultimate solution,"" she said in a statement. ""We still need new infrastructure, replacing the lead-tainted pipes in the city remains my top priority.""(Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by David Gregorio)"
2,POLITICS,Trump Tries To Reassure Nervous Donors By Forgiving $50 Million Loan,Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-50-million-campaign-loan_us_576c45f2e4b0f1683238f643,They were worried Trump would use their money to pay himself back.,2016-06-23,Trump had promised before that he'd convert that $50 million into campaign contributions.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576c47a91500002f001bb131.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has forgiven some $50 million in personal loans he made to his presidential campaign, his staff announced Thursday. The timing of the announcement was intended to calm GOP donors worried that Trump might use their donations to pay himself back.""Mr. Trump has fully extinguished (terminated) this loan per his commitment,"" the campaign said in a statement. ""Therefore, he has personally invested in excess of $50 million dollars in the future of our country.""Of course, the rules for converting loans to contributions require a bit more than a press release from campaign staff. To make it official, Trump must file a sworn statement to that effect with the Federal Election Commission. His campaign said Trump would file that statement by the end of the day on Thursday.This was not the first time that Trump and his campaign staff had announced that he would not collect on the loans he made to his campaign. On May 13, Trump said he had ""absolutely no intention of paying myself back."" But his FEC filing for May revealed that he hadn't actually forgiven the loans.As Republican Party operatives and officials have been laboring to reshape Trump's campaign into a more professional fundraising operation, it became crucial that the candidate clear up any lingering doubts on that score. As long as Trump's $50 million was still classified as a loan, it would be legal for him to reimburse himself out of other people's donations.Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak said that forgiving the loan would help assuage donors’ fears, but that more is needed.“It removes something that is indefensible. Now that nonstarter has been removed. But he has all these other nonstarters,” Mackowiak said, pointing to how Trump’s campaign has reimbursed his children’s travel expenses related to his White House run, hired and paid his own businesses for multiple services and used a much more expensive airplane than he needs. “Not only are they not raising money, but they’re spending it wastefully, so it’s doubly bad.”Earlier this week, Republicans (and Democrats and pretty much everyone else) were shocked when Trump's latest FEC refiling revealed that his campaign had only $1.3 million in cash on hand at the end of May and had raised a paltry $3.1 million in his first month as the party's presumptive nominee. By comparison, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had $42 million in the bank at the end of May.Between now and November, Clinton is expected to raise and spend more than a billion dollars. Nobody knows what Trump will raise or spend.The real estate mogul has been on a fundraising tear this week, starting with an ""emergency"" fundraising email on Saturday night and culminating in a New York event on Tuesday that Trump's aides say raised more than $6 million for the candidate and the Republican National Committee. Even if Trump is willing to ask wealthy donors for money (and it's not yet clear that he is), the self-professed billionaire still has an enormous amount of ground to make up going into the general election.On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's campaign expressed support for yet another pro-Trump super PAC, this one to be funded in large part by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer -- who had earlier supported Trump's rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the nomination. Unlike some of his fellow GOP primary contenders, Cruz has yet to endorse the presumptive nominee.The new PAC, registered with the FEC as ""Make America Number I,"" is the fourth pro-Trump super PAC in recent months to court donors by claiming to be the only real pro-Trump super PAC.The candidate spent much of the primary season denouncing the influence of super PACs in politics and arguing that his alleged ability to self-fund his campaign meant he was not beholden to special interests.Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks maintained the party line on Thursday, telling The Wall Street Journal that the campaign ""continues to disavow the support of all super PACs, as we have throughout this election.” It remains to be seen how many more months like May the Trump campaign can endure before it is forced to change its tune.

Nicknamed ""Peanut,"" he was still just 5-foot-7 as a scrawny high school sophomore. His father was not around and his mother -- who has since died -- was constantly in and out of jail. Food was scarce in their Alexandria, Virginia home. Dunn and his brother, John, had to eat Hot Pockets for dinner and scavenge for food throughout the day.The brothers even spent five months home alone. They stopped attending school because they feared they could be separated by the foster care system. Kris Dunn was nine years old, fighting teenage drug dealers and playing games of one-on-one for cash against older kids. Eventually, he and his older brother reconnected with their father and began to turn their lives around.The 22-year-old Dunn has since blossomed into a rangy 6-foot-4, 220 lb. point guard and potential top-three pick in Thursday night's NBA Draft. He earned back-to-back Big East Player and Defensive Player of the Year honors and was named a consensus second-team All-American during his junior campaign (fourth year) at Providence.Amid the biggest week of his life, Dunn -- who averaged 23 points on 52 percent shooting in two NCAA Tournament games, including Providence's first tournament win since 1997 -- caught up with The Huffington Post to discuss his remarkably unlikely journey to hoops stardom.Also, click here to read about the five safest draft prospects and here to read about the five riskiest. And here for our Q&A with Duke's Brandon Ingram, the likely second pick in the draft.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.How did enduring such incessant hardship as a child shape you?That’s a big factor, my upbringing, I tell people that all the time. I’ve been through so much at a young age that it helps me get through things that I’m going through today. In my perspective, nothing can bring me down because I had to deal with real life stuff at an early age. My mom going in and out of jail, hardly getting to meet my dad -- those are real life things I had to deal with at a young age.It made me a better kid because at a young age I was very emotional. I was mad all the time because of the situation. I’m in a great space. My dad is in my life, we've built a relationship. I don’t want to say I’m impenetrable because that’s just not the word I’m looking for but I almost feel like anything that comes at me, I’m mature enough and I can handle it the best way I know I can. Your relationship with your dad was forged on long drives to Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) tournaments during your teenage years. What’s crazy is my dad would drive me everywhere -- he had to work the night shifts [as a poker room supervisor at Mohegan Sun Casino], so sometimes he would work from two in the morning and get out at 11. He would have to drive me from Connecticut to New York with no rest -- so the things he does for me I’m very appreciative. And those long rides you have no choice but to build with each other. People always ask me what do you think about your dad: Well he’s still my best friend. We know each other in and out like a book and that’s special to me. I think every kid has that bond with their father and I’m lucky to have a father that’s there for me, who loves me.You had scant interest from college recruiters and coaches at high school. When did the NBA start to become a reality for you?Probably midway through my junior year [of college]. Coming out of high school, I knew that I had a lot to improve in order to get to that stage. I felt like my first two years I wasn’t ready and it just happens that I had two shoulder injuries and I wanted to showcase my talents right away. I had to overcome that. I had a good [junior] year. I think everybody knows, when you’ve got that buzz, people talking about you all the time -- I think you know that you’ve got the chance to go to the NBA.So even during the McDonald's All-American and Jordan Brand games -- when you had blossomed into the mega-recruit -- you weren't thinking of the NBA?No, not at all: Not me or my family. We understood the process and I was kind of a short and a skinny kid. I knew I had to work on my body and I knew I had to fix some things in my game to try and be at that level. My dad is the type of person for me to not to get too high, stay humble.That’s the type of guy he was. He didn’t want me to start to think about the NBA because once you start thinking about the NBA too early, you start to lose the love and the competitiveness of the game. You start to become a selfish player, you start thinking about your self more and not your team and the accolades that you want as a whole. You admirably honored your commitment to Providence and didn't switch last-minute to a traditional blue-blood power like Kentucky, Florida, UConn, Louisville or Kansas -- schools that recruited you, but not until much later.Well my upbringing, I don’t just trust anyone, I’m a very loyal person. Coach [Ed] Cooley had shown that -- AAU games, he was always there. And he definitely showed it to me my sophomore year. There was no one in the gym -- one at night we would have games -- and he would be the only coach there -- that’s when he was at Fairfield.Someone who shows that commitment and determination, it shows that he’s loyal, that he really wants me. There’s no better feeling than when a coach believes in you so much. And Providence was right up the road from my family and friends [he moved to New London, Connecticut with his father]. So if anything went wrong I could go home, and I knew my family would have my back. I have somewhere, where I could just rest my mind and figure everything out. Everything worked out perfectly and I’m glad I’m a Friar.How specifically will the spacing and overall pace of the NBA game benefit you, along with the pick-and-roll?Pick-and-roll, space on the floor, is going to be a factor and the tempo of the game. People always tell me it’s a fast-paced game and if you watch my game, that’s the type of player I am. I love getting up and down and getting out in transition so that should be fun. I think I have all the attributes to have an impact right away.Is there one point guard you cannot wait to match up against?No. I mean there are so many great point guards. I want to go against Kyrie [Irving], [Russell] Westbrook, Stephen Curry and to go against some of the rookies, or a couple second year players, Emmanuel Mudiay, D’Angelo Russell those guys that are in the league. I can't pick one.Correction: A previous edition of this article stated that Dunn was a senior.

The ruling excluded anything that poses a threat to health and public safety.While some advocates say they’re pleased with the new compassionate police policies, they say they’re wary whether the new rules will be enforced.“We’ll believe it when we see it,” Carol Sobel, a civil rights attorney, told The Times. “You can hand out all the policies you want – that doesn’t make a difference unless you put enforcement behind it.”Visit DoSomething.org to find out how you can make a difference."
7,POLITICS,Affirmative Action Lives To See Another Day At The Supreme Court,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-affirmative-action_us_575853d5e4b00f97fba6e936,A divided court found that UT Austin's consideration of race in college admissions is constitutional.,2016-06-23,"Abigail Fisher, a white student who was denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin, has been at the center of a yearslong constitutional challenge to affirmative action.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In a victory for diversity in higher education, a hamstrung Supreme Court narrowly upheld the affirmative action program at the University of Texas at Austin, effectively allowing the school to keep using race as one of many factors in its admissions process.Justice Anthony Kennedy -- joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor -- ruled for a 4-3 majority that the university program does not violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws.""The Court’s affirmance of the University’s admissions policy today does not necessarily mean the University may rely on that same policy without refinement,"" Kennedy wrote in a 20-page decision. ""It is the University’s ongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies.""That Kennedy was willing to offer his vote to uphold a college admissions program that partly relies on race to make admissions decisions -- after issuing prior opinions taking a skeptical view of affirmative action policies generally -- indicates that he may be willing to add educational diversity to his concern for dignity in other constitutional areas, such as LGBT rights.""A university is in large part defined by those intangible qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness,"" he wrote. ""Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission.""The case, Fisher v. University of Texas, was one of the oldest cases left undecided on the court's current docket -- and one of a handful in which the late Justice Antonin Scalia could have been instrumental in the final outcome.After oral arguments in December, there was little doubt where the court's conservatives stood on the case, with Chief Justice John Roberts pondering out loud when the consideration of race in college admissions ""is going to be done."" But the most dramatic moment in the hearing came from Scalia himself, who suggested that affirmative action is not beneficial at all to black students who may not be up to the task of high-performing schools.“There are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to get them into the University of Texas, where they do not do well,” Scalia said, “as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school ... a slower-track school where they do well.” His comment drew audible gasps inside the courtroom.Regardless of how the court might have voted to rule in the case before Scalia's death, it had to scrap its decision and start again, this time with only seven justices, since Justice Elena Kagan had recused herself given her prior role in defending affirmative action as the Obama administration's top appellate lawyer.This might explain the narrow but meaningful ruling in Fisher -- a sign of compromise in light of the court's current makeup.At the center of the yearslong battle over the constitutionality of affirmative action was Abigail Fisher, a white woman who sued UT after she was denied admission under the school's Top 10 Percent rule, a ""race-neutral"" mechanism that automatically grants admission to top-performing high school students across Texas.Because Fisher didn't meet that threshold, under which about 75 percent of UT's incoming freshman class is awarded a spot, she challenged the school's ""holistic"" admissions plan, which selects the remainder of the applicant pool by looking at a snapshot of a student's whole file for admissions determinations.One of the factors in that snapshot is race, which Fisher -- with the help of conservative legal activist Edward Blum -- claimed was an unconstitutional consideration to make because it deprives her of equal protection under the law.Kennedy's opinion alluded to this tension between the importance of diverse campuses and treating everyone equally when he observed that ""it remains an enduring challenge to our Nation’s education system to reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity.""Justice Samuel Alito, writing for Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, issued a 51-page dissent that found fault with this reasoning, noting that the case is not about policing universities that want diverse student bodies, but rather their reliance on race to get there.""What is at stake,"" Alito wrote, ""is whether university administrators may justify systematic racial discrimination simply by asserting that such discrimination is necessary to achieve the educational benefits of diversity, without explaining — much less proving — why the discrimination is needed or how the discriminatory plan is well crafted to serve its objectives.""Writing only for himself, Thomas wrote a one-page dissent that continued to adhere to his hard-line approach -- one that says that affirmative action is ""categorically prohibited.""“The Constitution abhors classifications based on race because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all,"" Thomas wrote.But President Barack Obama and civil rights group praised the ruling, underscoring that there's still work left to be done to provide a level playing field for all.""We are not a country that guarantees equal outcomes, but we do strive to provide an equal shot to everybody,"" Obama said at a White House briefing on Thursday.""Diversity and equal opportunity have become bedrock American values. At a time when our country is increasingly divided, university campuses provide critical opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds to interact, learn about one another and become informed citizens and leaders,"" said the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund in a statement. ""This decision affirms this principle.""Fisher expressed disappointment in Thursday's decision. ""I hope that the nation will one day move beyond affirmative action,"" she said.Blum, who has also spearheaded lawsuits against affirmative action programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said that the Supreme Court's ruling could lead to a weakening of ""the social fabric that holds us together as a nation.""""Today’s decision is a sad step backward for the original, colorblind principles to our civil rights laws,” he said in a statement.This story has been updated with statements from Abigail Fisher and Edward Blum."
8,QUEER VOICES,How Orlando Brutally Exposed The Backlash – And Indifference – To LGBT Equality,Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-orlando-brutally-exposed-the-backlash-and-indifference-to-lgbt-equality_us_576c0c15e4b0795798cb588b,"It’s important to talk about the outpouring of support, but we can't let it seduce us into believing the hate isn't still very real.",2016-06-23,"A sign with the number 49 on it is pictured as part of a makeshift memorial following the Pulse night club shootings in Orlando, Florida, U.S., June 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576c1ab91500002b0073c2a1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yes, there’s been an enormous outpouring from many Americans who raised millions for local LGBT groups, victims’ families and survivors of the Orlando massacre. Politicians have spoken out in powerful ways, supporting LGBT rights, with at least one even apologizing for past actions. And many prominent public figures and performers have rallied, like those big names in the Broadway community that came together for a fundraiser to record, ""What the World Needs Now,"" a vital show of support.This is light years from what might have happened – what did happen -- in the past when the LGBT community was hit with tragedy. But there’s another reality that has come into focus as well: The backlash to equality is very real, the hate against LGBT people is alive and well and the indifference and fear by even those we’d expect to support us is ever present. Here are just a few examples:Donald Trump this week met with hundreds of anti-LGBT activists and vowed to lift the ban on politicking by churches and other tax-exempt groups -- which would include trying to get anti-LGBT laws passed -- and called ""religious liberty,"" the code phrase for anti-LGBT sentiment, a top priority.All of this and more shows that, no matter what the motives of Omar Mateen, whatever combustible mix of influences – and new details are emerging every day – LGBT people are still very much under attack in this country and can’t often count on media and allies to present our story properly or come to our defense. And anti-LGBT politicians carry on with their agenda against us. North Carolina's GOP governor, Pat McCrory, continued this week to pummel transgender people, defending HB2, while, in state legislatures across the country, anti-LGBT politicians are back to business as usual, trying to pass the over 100 bills that will stop LGBT rights from advancing.While it’s important to talk about the outpouring of support, we can't let it seduce us into believing the hate isn't still a very real and dangerous threat. That hate empowered the mass shooter to go into the Pulse nightclub. And that act is now empowering more haters to spread their hate. Now is the time to take our grief and sorrow, turn it into anger, and direct that anger into action against the preachers and politicians in Congress and across the country who are exploiting fear and hate, and keeping us from achieving full equality."
9,POLITICS,Republicans: We Don’t Want To Work For President Trump. But Someone Has To.,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-foreign-policy-advise-r-trump_us_576b0a1ce4b0c0252e785765,Conservative national security experts are worried about Trump's policies. But some are even more concerned that he won't have any good advisers.,2016-06-23,"As Republican politicians line up behind Donald Trump, conservative national security experts are still wary of the idea of the bombastic casino mogul as commander in chief.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576b0a7915000030001bade6.jpeg?cache=wxB9PmoscB&ops=crop_0_129_2626_2239%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Earlier this month, Kurt Volker, a career diplomat who now heads the McCain Institute, had dinner with two friends -- both, he said, “serious, accomplished foreign policy people” who had also served in government. Inevitably, the conversation turned to the 2016 elections and the reality television star at the top of the Republican ticket. ""If Donald Trump does get elected, I don’t want to work in a Trump administration,"" one of Volker's friends said. ""But I want you two to go do it.""Some Republican foreign policy hands -- including 121 who signed a letter listing the ways in which Trump’s proposed foreign policy ideas would endanger the country -- describe a moral obligation to condemn the candidate often and loudly. But some, like Volker and his friends, are thinking ahead. If Trump does end up winning the election in November, they reason, it would be good to have a few experienced foreign policy hands around who haven’t offended the notoriously thin-skinned candidate. “Signing that letter is like 140 of the smartest people that I can think of on foreign policy -- and now they’re all going to be blacklisted,” Volker said, referring to the March critique. “Is that a good idea?” Volker and several other conservative-leaning national security experts interviewed by The Huffington Post agree that there’s plenty to criticize about the presumptive Republican nominee, who describes plans to cut off U.S. allies, cozy up to Russia, launch a trade war against China, reinstate torture as an interrogation method, target terrorists’ families in airstrikes, build an expensive wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and ban all Muslims from entering the country. But though they don't expect Trump to seek their guidance, many won’t rule out working for him in the future. Working in a Trump National Security Council, Pentagon or State Department, they say, would be more about fulfilling a civic duty to their country in a time of desperate need than landing a career-enhancing opportunity. Mitchell Reiss, who held several titles in the Bush-era State Department and went on to advise former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) in their presidential bids, described Trump as “intellectually and temperamentally unqualified to become president.""“But should he become president, I do think that nobody should reflexively eliminate the option of working in a Trump administration,” Reiss continued. “You have to do what’s best for the country … But I’m not keeping my phone clear waiting for that call.”At least one of the signers of the anti-Trump letter won't rule out working for him at some point in the future. “I wouldn’t rule out working for anyone once they’re in the Oval Office,” said former Romney adviser Matthew Kroenig, who now teaches at Georgetown University. “I said in that letter I would work to stop Trump from being elected, and I stand by that … but I do think the country, the world, is probably better off if he has good people.”That calculation suggests a belief -- or at least, a hope -- that Trump is influenceable. Politicians who have come around and endorsed Trump sheepishly defended their support by suggesting that Trump is still figuring out this whole politics thing. He’ll moderate his policies and rhetoric over time, they say. An exhaustive survey by Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution of Trump’s comments over the past several decades suggests the demagogic candidate will be hard to mold. Much of what appears to be impromptu spitballing is surprisingly consistent with his past statements. Trump has long warned that allies are taking advantage of the U.S., expressed antagonism towards Japan, and praised strongmen like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Peter Feaver, a Duke University professor who served in Bush’s National Security Council, says that many in the conservative foreign policy community are skeptical of the benefits of publicly supporting the loudmouthed candidate. “First, is the sense that he’s likely to lose and you will be forever tarred if you endorse him,"" he said. ""Second, he is unlikely to listen to your advice. So even if he wins and you go in, the chance that you can do good is limited.”There’s good reason to be concerned about a dearth of national security brainpower in Trump land. The campaign employs just 70 staffers and Trump once dodged a question about foreign policy advisers, telling MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski he likes to consult himself because he has a “very good brain.” “None of my former colleagues from the Bush administration is advising Trump, I believe,” Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in an email. Abrams, who was advising Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said it’s impossible, at this point, to answer the question of whether he’d take a position in the Trump administration. Scholars from the American Enterprise Institute offered advice to every campaign except that of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), but nobody from the conservative think tank has signed on with Trump, said Danielle Pletka, the group’s senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies. Volker said he has not met a single person from the community of foreign policy experts who has expressed an active desire to work in a Trump administration -- and many have flat out said they won’t.By March, reporters were regularly pressing Trump to reveal his team of foreign policy advisers. During a presidential debate, he name-dropped Richard Haass, the head of CFR, and Jack Keane, the retired general known for his role in pushing for the Iraq surge, as two people he respected. Haass, who has briefed several candidates, including Trump, declined to be interviewed.Keane said in an interview that he has advised five of the Republican presidential candidates -- but Trump was not one of them. The retired general recently received a phone call from Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the head of Trump’s national security advisory committee, who told Keane he was on a “shortlist” of foreign policy advisers. Nothing came of the call. Keane is open to advising Trump but was left with the impression that he “failed the screen test” after expressing disagreement with Sessions’ vision of the U.S. pulling back from global affairs. “The worst thing for American foreign policy would be, in fact, to disengage further,” said Keane, who characterizes himself as politically independent and habitually declines to endorse candidates. When Trump finally unveiled his team of foreign policy advisers, it was a crew of five largely unknown individuals. One, Walid Phares, had ties to a Lebanese militia and another, Joseph Schmitz, to the infamous private security contractor Blackwater. George Papadopoulos listed his role as a U.S. representative to the Model United Nations on his LinkedIn page -- an accolade he has since removed. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on whether their foreign policy advisory group has expanded since. Feaver, who served in government under both Bush and former President Bill Clinton, has had conversations with friends who said they would “hold their nose and support [Trump]” if he were to become the nominee, but aren’t yet ready to make it public. “I suspect people are waiting for a string of good news that would create rhetorical cover to do stuff with him,” Feaver said. “And he keeps missing it.” But others think the idea of trying to influence Trump is a fool's game. “I am in the category of people willing to burn every bridge,” Kori Schake, a Hoover Institution fellow who served in the Bush administration and advised Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) during his 2008 presidential bid. “Good people can and should try to work for him. But I am deeply skeptical that these people who go to work for Trump will be able to have any influence over his policies.""“What I think is more likely than a reconciliation with Trump by conservative foreign policy and defense policy experts,"" she added, ""is a slow, agonizing reconciliation that Hillary Clinton is a safer pair of hands.”She’s voting for Clinton.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The businessman returns to the town for his golf course's grand reopening on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Donald Trump visits Scotland on his fuel-guzzling jet for a ribbon-cutting at his golf resort Friday, there may well be thousands of unwitting patrons footing much of the bill: Republican donors to his campaign.While the purpose of Trump’s visit is to gin up publicity for Trump Turnberry’s reopening, it was his presidential campaign that sent out news releases about the trip. It also arranged travel for the press corps -- ensuring that he receives far more attention for his private business than he would have had he not been running for president -- and scheduled specific media events for them to cover. If Trump is, in fact, treating the trip and its six-figure cost as a campaign event, it would mean his newly recruited donors – both those cutting big checks at his fundraisers and those giving small amounts online – will be subsidizing the expense.“It’s the campaign paying for things that have nothing to do with the campaign,” said Texas-based Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak. “Do donors want to see their money spent for this?”One longtime Republican National Committee member joked that only people who have actually given Trump money would be unhappy, and there aren’t all that many of those.“The only people who are going to be upset are [RNC Chairman] Reince Priebus and the donors who’ve given to him,” the RNC member said privately. “You won’t be able to blame me, because I haven't given him a penny. So I won't feel bad about it.""The RNC referred questions about the trip to the Trump campaign, and the Trump campaign did not respond to The Huffington Post’s query.Whether Trump chooses to pay for the air travel on his aging Boeing 757 -- at least $100,000 in jet fuel alone for the transatlantic round trip -- and other expenses through his campaign may not be known until July 20, when an accounting of his June contributions and expenditures is due to the Federal Election Commission. Trump, though, has already used campaign staff and equipment to publicize the trip in the past days.FEC rules prohibit converting campaign money for personal use, but there is no specific guidance that covers Trump’s exact situation, said Paul S. Ryan of the Campaign Legal Center watchdog group.“He seems to be using his campaign to promote his personal business. Is it illegal? I can’t say it is. We seem to be in some murky water here,” Ryan said. “This type of activity is somewhat unprecedented.”According to a June 19 press release sent out by his campaign, Trump is to hold a news conference Friday morning at his Turnberry resort, followed by a ceremonial ribbon-cutting and a photo opportunity at a lighthouse. The campaign schedule showed a “possible press activity” on Saturday in Aberdeen, where Trump has another golf resort.Trump’s most recent FEC filing sparked a fresh round of criticism from Republican strategists, delegates and donors with its details of more than $1 million in spending on Trump’s own companies -- including a whopping $423,372 to Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he had staged some news conferences.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
11,ENTERTAINMENT,"For Paul Giamatti And Ethan Hawke, Drama Is Easy But Soap Operas Are Hard",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-giamatti-ethan-hawke-the-phenom_us_576984f8e4b087b70be60daa,"The veteran actors star in the new baseball movie ""The Phenom.""",2016-06-23,"Ethan Hawke, Johnny Simmons and Paul Giamatti attend the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of ""The Phenom.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576988cd1500002b0073bc1a.jpeg?cache=k04pX7dNlZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sports movies are almost always elaborate metaphors for overcoming adversity. The new baseball movie ""The Phenom"" is no different, but it strips some of the genre's clichés. There's no ra-ra finale where the team finally succeeds, which means there's no training montage set to empowering music, no locker-room reflections and no tough-loving coaches. There is, however, a thoughtful mentor and a troubled father. In this case, they're played by Paul Giamatti and Ethan Hawke, respectively, with Johnny Simmons (""Jennifer's Body,"" ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") portraying the titular baseball pitcher who is struggling with feelings of isolation despite being one of the country's top prospects. Ahead of the movie's VOD and limited theatrical release this Friday, The Huffington Post sat down with Giamatti and Hawke to discuss sports movies, stage fright, typecasting and why they have major respect for soap-opera actors.Are you sports-movie fans? They're very hit and miss. But I know you have another one coming up, Paul.Giamatti: Do I have another one coming up?A ""Battle of the Sexes"" movie, right? Giamatti: I had no idea. Am I in something called ""Battle of the Sexes""?Hawke: Are you?Giamatti: Oh, that! I don’t know if that’s actually happening. I think that was about Bobby Riggs. Yeah, I don’t know what ever happened with that.Hawke: Has there been a great tennis movie?Giamatti: Uh, not that I can think of.Hawke: There’s been some good tennis short stories. I remember Kerouac has a short story about tennis that’s really good. No, what am I saying? His short is about baseball, and David Foster Wallace has the great tennis stuff.Giamatti: I did a good high school wrestling movie. That’s a good movie, actually. It’s called “Win Win.”Hawke: I saw that movie. That’s a terrific movie.Giamatti: It’s Tom McCarthy, the guy who did “Spotlight.” It’s hard to avoid sports movies, but as you said, there aren’t necessarily a whole lot of good ones.Hawke: The trouble is it’s a little like the horror genre. People will see a bad horror movie. It’s not that there aren’t also good movies, but because people enjoy sports so much, they will sometimes just go see the movie because they want to watch the sport.Giamatti: If you press the button somewhat accurately, it’ll satisfy them.Hawke: It’s like, OK, you know if you see a sports movie, you’re gonna get that feeling at the end that you have when your team wins the Super Bowl. And I want that feeling, so I’m going to go see the movie. The genius of “Rocky” was that it misdirected that. You had that feeling even when they lost.Giamatti: The genre of boxing movies, I like that. I watched a lot of those. I feel like most of the good ones are boxing movies.Look at “Creed” last year. Giamatti: “Creed” is a really good movie.Hawke: I really like “Creed.” Or even, what was the one with Nick Nolte? The UFC movie was pretty interesting, ""Warrior."" That kind of hand-to-hand combat lends itself to cinema well.Giamatti: It’s stripped-down drama.Hawke: Baseball is interesting because it’s so photogenic in a certain way because it's the field and the pitcher. It’s a little like bullfighter and the bull. It’s such a mental aspect to the game, and that’s what interests me about this movie. Paul said this, but in a lot of ways this movie could have been about a young piano player. It’s so much more about what it’s like to have a talent and what it’s like to outshine your family.We’re so used to getting that final showdown on the field. ""The Phenom"" doesn't have that, which is nice.Giamatti: I love that this movie doesn’t do that. All that matters really is what’s happening off the field. What’s on the field is not really that important.Hawke: It’s a great idea because really what matters is what’s happening in his head, and once what’s happening in his head is right, who cares if he wins the game?Giamatti: It doesn’t matter!Hawke: He probably will win it, but you get the sense that he’s not going to freak out. And I’ve had different moments in my life as a stage actor where panic can set in, and when panic comes to rest on your shoulders, you don’t know what brought it there, but it makes life miserable. It’s so nice when it leaves, and it obviously comes because of something going on inside you. Does it hit you in the middle of a performance or right before you go onstage?Hawke: I’m talking about the whole month around it. It’s a haze of anxiety. It can sometimes not come, but once it’s in your dressing and in your psychic space, man ...Giamatti: Have you ever had that kind of real stage fright? I don’t think I’ve had real stage fright.Hawke: I have.Giamatti: But like, “I can’t go out there, you’re going to have to shove me out there”?Hawke: Yeah.Giamatti: I don’t think I’ve had that. I’ve had bad anxiety. I’ve had terrible anxiety. I’ve had near panic attack kind of thing, but I don’t think I’ve ever had what people say to me is genuine stage fright, which is just like, “If I go out there, I’m going to fucking die.” What did you do?Hawke: I kind of made a documentary about it. That’s what prompted me to make “Seymour: An Introduction,” because I met this pianist and they have it a lot worse than we do. For me, it was shocking. A little bit like “The Phenom,” I was 18 when “Dead Poets Society” came out. I was jettisoned to the top of my class before I knew what I was doing. Once the hubris of youth wears off, it creates this haze of “Maybe I wasn’t put together right. Maybe I didn’t build this ship right.”Giamatti: There are pieces missing.Hawke: Yeah, I don’t know that I’ve been taught everything, and now I’m at the age where I’m not supposed to be promising anymore. I’m supposed to have arrived, and I don’t feel that I’ve arrived. That’s the little door that opens, the “I’m not good enough.” If you give that a lot of room, it can make a lot of noise.Are you able to shut that door?Hawke: If you ever see this doc about this piano player, Seymour Bernstein, what he talks about is that trying to shut the door is actually the problem. It’s the truth. You’re not good enough, and you have a lot of work today. That’s the whole point. Once you have that humility, your work can go to the next level. The only problem with fear and anxiety, really, is pretending you don’t have it. Then you create a war inside yourself, but if you can say, “This anxiety, I’m up all night and I’m going to work on my lines and I’ll be better prepared,” or, “I’m going to take that voice class and I’ll study this extra thing and I’m going to be prepared because then I’ve taken responsibility for myself.” And if it doesn’t go well, that’s up to fate. I’m not in charge of the size of my gift, and I’m not in charge of my talent. I’m in charge of my effort. And then you can relax. Then you get some experience under your belt and things start to happen by themselves.Paul, you’ve become known for playing some vicious guys.Hawke: And all the women you play are so kind [laughs].Giamatti: One of the more interesting things about this movie was to go, “Oh, Ethan gets to play the guy that I would normally play.” And he’s awesome in it. It was one of the reasons I wanted to do it. I mean, the script was wonderful to begin with, but I was like, “Oh, I get to play a nice person. I don’t ever get to play nice people.”Was there a moment you realized that all the scripts hitting your desk borrowed those same notes? You played cruel music managers in both ""Love & Mercy"" and ""Straight Outta Compton"" last year, for example.Giamatti: Not all of them, but people definitely like to see me be a fucking bastard. It’s like, OK, that’s fine. And they’re always interesting characters, but it’s nice to play someone who’s not necessarily going after somebody.Hawke: When I was younger, I was always being cast in the ingénue part, and that’s a snoozefest.Giamatti: Of course it is.Hawke: This problem is far more interesting.Giamatti: It’s not even a problem. And what’s interesting is I’ve gone through such funny periods. I went through a period where I only played priests. I played priest after priest. Then I went through a weird period where I only played doctors. But it was very nice to say I can just be a nice guy.Hawke: What was good for me was that, when I got the script, Paul was already attached, so I could read the script imagining you. It changes the script a lot, actually. You read it and you go, “Oh, Paul will do this great.” Because most scripts can go either way. You just have to visualize it, like, “Oh, well, if he’s playing that note, then I can play this note.""How do you handle it when you're struggling with the way your co-stars approach a scene?Hawke: I would say this: Over and over again, acting is an interpretive art, and if the quality of the writing isn’t there, you can’t manufacture it. Sometimes, like this script, I read it, and I was moved. That’s very hard to do, to put life inside something and touch other people.Giamatti: There’s also a thing when you’re reading it where you feel at ease while you take it in. Your mind isn’t going, “How the fuck am I going to make that work?” With this thing, it’s holding you up -- you don’t have to hold it up.Hawke: Every year they have the Oscars, and I actually feel like those awards should go to someone who was on an episode of “Matlock.”Giamatti: Absolutely.Hawke: It’s so much harder. When you’re working with talented people and quality writing on a quality project, you’d be a fool to muck it up.Giamatti: I feel that way about soap operas. If anyone anywhere can be at all decent on a soap opera, they’re amazing because that shit is really hard to do.Hawke: When you’re working with Steven Spielberg and some fancy-pants cinematographer and some Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, are you nuts?Giamatti: Or it’s the guy who has to come in and play the bartender for the day across from somebody. That’s really fucking hard to do.Hawke: I remember I had this little part I got in a movie with Jeremy Irons. He had the big showy part, and I had like four lines. Giamatti: The worst!Hawke: He would have these long monologues, and I’d have a line like “Yeah, but my mom doesn’t think so,” or something like that. I finally said to him, “I keep tanking this. You do this amazing work and it’s all left to me.” He was so generous. He was like, “Listen, I’m so glad I’m not you in this scene.” You actually can’t excel; you can only screw up.What about superhero movies that are driven by green screens?Giamatti: I don’t see a lot of those. I don’t know. It sounds like some of them are good. Hawke: You know, if people would stop going to them, they’d stop making them. It’s so frustrating to me to hear everybody talking about how bad they are, but they all keep going. Each one is a bigger hit than the other one, and as long as they keep making money and as long as we keep talking about them, they’re going to go. The victory of this movie is that it got made at all. It’s such a simple, humble movie, and yet I do feel like it will make a lot of people happy to hear their own voice inside this movie.""The Phenom"" opens in limited release Friday. "

Others have used social media to send death threats. To protect its congregants, the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce now has two armed security guards at night, shining flashlights toward the faithful as they arrive to break their daily fasts and to join evening prayers in the holy month of Ramadan.Rehman Tahir, a 32-year-old Fort Pierce native who attends the mosque, said he finds the threats disheartening, but he doubts that most locals share in that hostility.“There’s obviously been people who threaten the masjid and the people who come here,” Tahir told HuffPost, using the Arabic word for “mosque.” “But nobody expected this and nobody knows how to react. I think, overall, everyone has handled themselves very well.”If Tahir’s reaction appears optimistic, he’s not alone. After finding out that Mateen came from Fort Pierce, Rev. Bob Baggott of the Community Church of nearby Vero Beach started sending emails. He wanted to hold a religious event not just to speak to his own non-creedal Christian congregation, but to bring together people from the Muslim faith and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community as well.“Our feeling here was we needed to come together,” Baggott told HuffPost. “What better place to do that than in a house of worship? And then we said to ourselves, if we’re coming together in a house of worship, we need to come together with all the faiths.”All told, members of four major religions -- Christians, Jews, Muslims and Hindus -- joined with the LGBT community for an inter-faith gathering at Baggott's church last week to share a message of love and compassion in response to the shooting.For Baggott, one of the most touching moments of the night was when a Muslim teenager played “Amazing Grace,” a Christian song, on the clarinet before reading aloud from the Quran in Arabic.“It was really powerful,” Baggott told HuffPost. “It was something this community has never seen.”John Hillhouse, 86, read from the Bible's Sermon on the Mount that night. Having come out to himself at age 13 and to the gay community by the time he was 20, Hillhouse has lived through a long arc of LGBT history. He remembers feeling that he'd done something wrong when he first realized he was attracted to other boys -- maybe it was because he didn't like sports, he thought back then. But even after a killer massacred people at a gay nightclub, Hillhouse said he felt inspired by the widespread support for the LGBT community and by President Barack Obama's speeches following the attack. “Coming from all that self-hatred and the hatred from society, today it’s a long way,” Hillhouse said. “It’s incredible the support gay people are getting.”Victor Begg, a Muslim leader who spoke at the inter-faith event, is worried about the ongoing anger directed at those who practice Islam.Begg and his wife retired to the area three years ago, moving from Detroit to a condo with a beach view. In Michigan, Begg had helped his local mosque build up a congregation, and he remains active in religious circles, calling himself an “ecumaniac.”While Mateen had claimed to act on behalf of the Islamic State group in a 911 call during the shooting, Begg questioned the killer’s adherence to the Muslim faith, noting that he had carried out the attack during Ramadan. Had he been practicing the faith he professed, Begg said, Mateen would have been at the mosque for prayers or at home with his family.“How could this man claim to be a practicing Muslim?” Begg said. “He just committed the ultimate sin, 49 times.”Last week’s inter-faith gathering left Begg feeling hopeful, although he remains concerned about the wider hostility toward Islam -- which he sees as more intense than even the backlash after Sept. 11, 2001. He noted that after those earlier attacks, then-President George W. Bush spoke in defense of the American Muslim community, declaring that “acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith.”By contrast, presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has reiterated his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, slurred all Muslim immigrants as incipient terrorists and said it's time to consider racial profiling. He has also urged surveillance of mosques.“I think the big problem is the charged political climate,” Begg told HuffPost.“The community never had a problem here,” he added. “Every hospital you go to has Muslim doctors. However, this election season has caused problems. You turn on the TV and hear this guy [Trump], and he uses the media very effectively.”While he refrained from discussing politics, Tahir said he thought that other Americans might view the congregation at his mosque with more fellow feeling if they just knew more about them.“I was born and raised here,” Tahir said. “I’m probably the only Muslim who watches NASCAR, listens to country and drives a truck.”Christopher Mathias contributed reporting.

David Cicilline shows Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including Rep. John Lewis (R) staging a sit-in on the House floor ""to demand action on common sense gun legislation"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, United States, June 22, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576c3ff81500002a0073c385.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When House Speaker Paul Ryan interrupted Democrats' sit-in over gun control late Wednesday night, the protestors reportedly responded with a song -- the famous civil rights anthem, ""We Shall Overcome."" And just like that, an African American spiritual that once delivered a promise of freedom echoed through the halls of the U.S. Capitol Building.Earlier in the month, this simple tune was heard in vigils across the country, as people gathered to remember the victims of the Orlando shooting. ""Deep in my heart, I do believe, we shall overcome, some day,"" the mourners sang.The powerful sense of certainty that is evoked by this old hymn, and its endless adaptability, have turned it into a song that has been used in protests around the world -- from Northern Ireland to South Africa. Its backstory, which has many twists, turns, and unknowns, is reflective of its history as a folk song -- a song of the people that expresses a longing for a brighter future for all. While the melody of the song may have roots in classical music of the late 18th century, according to Ethan J. Kytle and Blain Roberts, scholars at California State University, Fresno, the song's lyrical connection to protests for freedom can be traced back to the period before the Civil War, when slaves knew it as “No More Auction Block.” By the late 1800s, the song was a well-known hymn sung in African-American churches, using the words, ""I’ll Be All Right.""At the turn of the century, a black Methodist minister from Philadelphia named Charles Albert Tindley published a version of the song that he called, ""I’ll Overcome Some Day,"" according to the archivist Kate Stewart.A few years later, the song brought black and white mine workers in Alabama together to protest low wages. After World War II, an interracial coalition of cigar factory workers used the song during their own strike.The song was refined and re-written throughout the 1950s and 1960s, taken up by civil rights activists like the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr and Rep. Lewis. In his memoir about the civil rights movement, Lewis wrote that ""We Shall Overcome"" helped him through many years of struggle.""It gave you a sense of faith, a sense of strength, to continue to struggle, to continue to push on. And you would lose your sense of fear,"" Lewis wrote in the book, according to NPR. ""You were prepared to march into hell's fire.""As such, it's fitting that Lewis was on the House floor on Wednesday to hear that same tune used for another kind of battle -- the fight to pass stronger gun control legislation. The representatives changed one verse to ""We shall pass a bill"" -- proving once again its versatility as a prayerful hymn of protest.Below, a version of the old hymn published in The United Methodist Hymnal.1 We shall overcome, we shall overcome,we shall overcome someday!Oh, deep in my heart I do believewe shall overcome someday!"

But they didn't get a vote.,2016-06-23,"From left, Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), House Assistant Minority Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.), Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) sing ""We Shall Overcome"" Thursday after House Democrats ended their sit-in protest.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Nearly 26 hours after Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) strolled across the House floor and sat down to protest the absence of gun reform from the legislative docket, he and his fellow Democrats called an end to the demonstration.The 76-year-old civil rights icon was, appropriately, the last to speak at the lectern where numerous other colleagues had taken their turns to demand consideration of two bills that would bar those on a no-fly list from purchasing firearms and require background checks for gun purchases at gun shows and online. The Democrats had remained there through the night, even as Republican leadership had recessed the House, denying the protest live coverage on C-SPAN. The lawmakers who stayed used Periscope, a smartphone app that live-streams video, and Facebook Live videos, to get the word out instead.Ultimately, Lewis didn’t get a vote. And even if he had, it wasn’t likely that the bill would have passed. But the sit-in did galvanize the party and the public, with throngs of people flocking to the Capitol grounds Wednesday night to cheer on the congressional disruption.“It is a struggle and we are going to win the struggle,” Lewis said, as he wrapped up the sit-in.In the hours leading up to that unsatisfying conclusion, lawmakers struggled with the gravity of what they were doing: from their decision to break House rules to their plans for what would come next.One year ago this month, Rep. Jim Clyburn’s (D-S.C.) district was reeling after nine people were shot dead in a historic black church in Charleston. But it was his decades in the civil rights movement, fighting alongside Lewis, that came back to him.“In a strange sort of way for us to be on this floor today talking about the right to vote tells us a little about about how much remains to be done,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. “Despite the fact that the speaker has used his power to keep this legislation off of the floor, has used his power to shut down debate on this critical issue, it’s an idea whose time has come.”Sitting on the floor of the House for hours on end, Clyburn said, was “the most dynamic emotion I’ve felt since I’ve been here, and this is my 24th year.”Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), who didn’t leave the floor until almost 4 a.m. Thursday, was reminded of a similar debate last year. It was Dec. 2 and Democrats were trying to force debate on the ""no fly, no buy"" bill. Moments after the attempt failed, Aguilar walked off the floor. His phone buzzed with texts messages and calls from people back home in San Bernardino. Fourteen were dead, and 21 injured.“They teach you a lot here on how to handle casework, but no one teaches you how to comfort someone who has gone through tragedy like this and that’s what I was thrust into,” Aguilar told HuffPost.When House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) gaveled back into session late Wednesday evening, trying to bring the chamber back to order, Aguilar said he, too, couldn't help but turn to Lewis.“It’s not the same if other members said the exact same words but John Lewis is a powerful force who has stood time and time again on the right side of history and right side of our communities,” Aguilar said. “How can you leave the floor if John Lewis is having a sit-in on the floor of Congress.”Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) never left the floor during the protest. He was one of the four members who initially planned the disturbance.“It grew out of our really deep commitment to do something different and figure out a way to really draw attention to the urgency of this issue and pressure House Republicans to do something about the epidemic of gun violence,” he said. “We learned a lot about each other in these 24 hours.”Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) briefly took a nap in the cloakroom as the sit-in went on through the night. At one point when she was awake on the floor, a Republican member stepped on her. She brushed it off. It was the indifference that GOP leadership showed to the gun control bills -- capped off by the speaker forcing other votes and then closing the chamber for recess -- that bothered her more.“The way he did that was symbolic -- unable to see and to hear the intensity of feeling that’s in the country as well as in the chamber; it was so cynical,” Schakowsky said. “Like nothing was happening, he’s just going to wield that gavel no matter what.”For other Democrats, the night's proceedings had personal meaning. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) took a red-eye back to the Capitol from California after watching her colleagues hold the floor overnight. A survivor of multiple bullets during the 1978 Jonestown massacre, Speier showed members a bullet that was lodged in her body.“It was a dream come true,” she told HuffPost after the sit-in wrapped up. “This is the proverbial tipping point. When my parish priest preaches about gun violence in his homily, and every one explodes and applauds at the end of it -- which never happens -- you know that the American people are fed up.”Like Speier, Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) is a shooting victim. He became a quadriplegic when he was a junior cadet and two police officers were checking out a semi-automatic pistol and accidentally pulled the trigger thinking the gun wasn't loaded.“If they have an accident with a gun, anyone can have an accident with a gun,” Langevin said. Taking the floor, he said, was “one of the most exciting and meaningful moments of my 16 years here in Congress.”Not getting a vote was deflating for him.“We weren’t demanding that the bills had to pass,” he said. “But the American people deserve to have a vote, and the victims of gun violence deserve to have a vote.”Whether they will ever get that vote is uncertain. Because Democrats are in the minority right now, they have extremely limited power to bring legislation to the floor, absent a sudden change of heart from Ryan. They were extremely coy about what they might have in store when the House reconvenes on July 5.Democrats have ""a myriad of options"" on how to force the issue, said Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), who declined to reveal them because he didn't want Republicans to get wind. ""I wouldn't rule out anything right now,"" he added, when asked if another sit-in is possible.For now, the party seems poised to try to roll some of the energy of the sit-in into district-based action. ""It's going back to the district,"" said Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), who helped orchestrate the sit-in, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters that “activism” will continue for all of next week.“Let me be really clear about this: We cannot stop until we get a bill, until a law is passed,” she said. “This is not about politics, it’s not about elections, it’s not about campaigns.”Earlier, Pelosi and the rest of the caucus had walked with Lewis outside the Capitol into a sea of supporters holding signs touting gun control. The Georgia Democrat was treated as a conquering hero even though he had come up short.“Never give up!” he said.“Never give up!” people shouted back.“We’ve got to vote like we’ve never, ever voted before,” Lewis said.He then led the crowd in singing “We Shall Overcome.”Sam Stein contributed reporting.Read more:Democrats Stage Sit-In On House Floor Over Gun BillsSenate Democrats Bring Food To Support House Colleagues Conducting Sit-In On Gun LawsDemocrats Finally Tried To Do Something About The Gun BloodshedDemocrats Cause Chaos On House Floor As Republicans Pretend Everything Is FineProtesters Gather Outside U.S. Capitol To Push For Vote On GunsYou Will Never Be As Ecstatic As This Woman Delivering Pizzas To Rep.

He resigned on June 16, according to the district.""The patrol car was not properly equipped to transport a Police K9 having no agency approved kennel or heat alarm system,” the marshal’s office stated in a release obtained by The Huffington Post.As officials were looking into Inca’s death, they learned about the 2012 death of another dog that was in Peabody's custody.Dale, a yellow lab assigned to Peabody from 2007 to 2012 and subsequently retired from the force, was living with Peabody when he died under mysterious circumstances.""Peabody initially claimed Dale's death was accidental due to Dale choking on a toy,"" the marshal’s office stated.But Peabody later said that he had, in fact, shot Dale at his Pealing County home shortly after Dale retired from service, Cherokee County Marshal's Office Chief Ron Hunton told The Huffington Post. Authorities believe the dog was 6 years old at the time of his death.""When we started this investigation, we had no knowledge of Dale,"" Hunton told local ABC affiliate WSB-TV. ""Peabody says that the dog was ill and aggressive and that basically, that was the reason why he shot and killed the dog.""In a statement, the Cherokee County School District said that after Dale retired in May of 2012, Peabody requested ownership of him in accordance with the district's policy. ""The School District did not know of the allegations in regard to the death of Dale until the Cherokee County Marshal’s Office shared that information,"" they stated.Authorities searched Peabody’s former home on Monday as part of the investigation, recovering what they believe are the remains of a canine.

He resigned on June 16, according to the district.""The patrol car was not properly equipped to transport a Police K9 having no agency approved kennel or heat alarm system,” the marshal’s office stated in a release obtained by The Huffington Post.As officials were looking into Inca’s death, they learned about the 2012 death of another dog that was in Peabody's custody.Dale, a yellow lab assigned to Peabody from 2007 to 2012 and subsequently retired from the force, was living with Peabody when he died under mysterious circumstances.""Peabody initially claimed Dale's death was accidental due to Dale choking on a toy,"" the marshal’s office stated.But Peabody later said that he had, in fact, shot Dale at his Pealing County home shortly after Dale retired from service, Cherokee County Marshal's Office Chief Ron Hunton told The Huffington Post.

""Peabody says that the dog was ill and aggressive and that basically, that was the reason why he shot and killed the dog.""In a statement, the Cherokee County School District said that after Dale retired in May of 2012, Peabody requested ownership of him in accordance with the district's policy. ""The School District did not know of the allegations in regard to the death of Dale until the Cherokee County Marshal’s Office shared that information,"" they stated.Authorities searched Peabody’s former home on Monday as part of the investigation, recovering what they believe are the remains of a canine.

The initiative, which launched Thursday morning, is a public awareness campaign that celebrates the power of women helping women. ""It’s important to shine a light on the huge number of women who encourage and help each other every day,"" president of the Lean In organization Rachel Thomas told The Huffington Post. ""There’s a stereotype that women don’t help women, but it’s just not true."" As part of the campaign, Lean In launched a video in partnership with AOL MAKERS featuring female powerhouses such as Kerry Washington, Serena Williams, Emma Watson, Eva Longoria, Selena Gomez and more.In the video, each woman thanks the woman who supported and guided her to where she is today. Washington thanks ""Scandal"" creator Shonda Rhimes, while Williams thanks her sister and tennis partner Venus Williams. Abby Wambach thanks her teammate Mia Hamm and Selena Gomez thanks all the women behind the scenes on her Revival tour.  ""When women lean in together we accomplish amazing things,"" Sandberg says in the video. “So many women are lending their voices to this campaign because they have benefited firsthand from the support of other women and know what a difference it can make,” Sandberg said in a press release.“Together we can get to equality. Together we can raise our voices. Together we can stand up to anything and anyone,"" the women say in unison in the video.As Arianna Huffington told Sandberg in a recent interview for the new initiative, supporting one another is beneficial both at work and at home. ""The support I’ve received from women, both personally and professionally, has shown me over and over again the importance of creating what I call a tribe -- people who will always be in your corner, always there for you, in good times and tough times, whether you are succeeding or failing,"" Huffington said. The campaign is an important reminder that women are allies, not rivals and that when we work together we are unstoppable. As Williams says at the end of the video: ""We are all on the same team."""

They were attacked on the outskirts of the city of Calabar at around 05:30 a.m., police said.Calabar is a coastal city 354 miles east of Lagos, and the capital of Cross River State in the Niger Delta region, where both criminal gangs and militants have been active.Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called the incident a ""very serious kidnapping"" in response to a journalist's question and urged calm in reporting the incident.""These are the facts as we know them: three Australians and one Australian resident were among seven people kidnapped in an attack on an Australia contractor's operations in Nigeria. One person was killed in the attack,"" Turnbull told reporters.Two expatriates managed to flee, said Irene Ugbo, a spokeswoman for Cross River state police, adding that she did not know the nationality of any of the workers feared still held.Ugbo had earlier said that only two of the kidnapped were Australians, and one was a New Zealander, while another police officer said a South African had been abducted.The kidnappers had not contacted police, she said.Kidnappings of foreigners are common in the Delta region, which holds most of the crude oil whose sales make about 70 percent of Nigeria's national income.OPEC member Nigeria was Africa's top oil producer until a recent spate of attacks on oil facilities pushed it behind Angola. Production has fallen from 2.2 million barrels at the start of the year to around 1.6 million barrels, helping push up global oil prices.Lafarge Africa said it had been informed of the incident by Australian contractor Macmahon.""Macmahon is working with the security agencies to resolve this situation,"" said Viola Graham-Douglas, a spokeswoman for Lafarge Africa.Macmahon Holdings Ltd, which was placed on a trading halt in the wake of the incident, confirmed the incident in a statement late on Thursday.""We are working to ensure the safe return of all the men involved and are in communication with their families,"" the company said.""Macmahon is providing support to the men’s families and we ask the media to respect their privacy at this time.

Last summer, he made a splash by joining forces with Blum & Poe to stage a show of new works by Takashi Murakami on the island.The lavish festivities for the exhibition opening last summer, became the hot ticket of the season on the island.Ibiza was an international bohemian hotspot throughout most of the 20th century -- well before it was embraced by the hordes of clubbers -- and Laliberté is not the only one who's been working hard to revive the island's artistic and intellectual past.Since 2013, the Madrid-based gallery Parra & Romero has a second space in the island, a huge refurbished warehouse where they stage solo and group presentations by gallery artists. Currently on view are shows by Adam Pendleton and Robert Barry.Moreover, on July 22, the gallery is launching a new sculpture park amid the stunning rural landscape of Ibiza, which will feature works by Stefan Brüggemann, Luis Camnitzer, and Philippe Decrauzat among others, curated by Jeróme Sans."

Unlike a classic exit poll, it was based on online responses by a pre-selected sample of people rather than a survey of voters as they left polling stations.Nigel Farage, head of the UK Independence Party and a leading voice in favor of leaving the EU, told Sky News he did not expect to be on the winning side.""Turnout looks to be exceptionally high and looks like Remain will edge it,"" he said according to the broadcaster. Sterling rose 0.75 percent to $1.4987 on the Farage comments and the poll.The four-month campaign has sharply polarized the nation and the final outcome of the vote could change the face of Europe.If Britain becomes the first state to leave the EU, the so-called Brexit would be the biggest blow to the 28-nation bloc since its foundation.The EU would be stripped of its second-biggest economy and one of its two main military powers, and could face calls for similar votes by anti-EU politicians in other countries.If it votes to stay, Britain has been promised a special status exempting it from any further political integration, but European leaders will still have to address a sharp rise in euroscepticism across the continent.A Brexit vote would also deal a potentially fatal blow to the career of Prime Minister David Cameron, who called the referendum and campaigned for the country to stay in, against a Leave camp led by rivals from within his own Conservative Party.Results are due to be announced by most of the 382 individual local counting areas between around 0000 GMT and 0300 on Friday.There is no exit poll because the margin of error for an event which has no precedent is too large. Turnout in each counting area will be announced, beginning at around 2230 GMT.The vote came on a day when London and parts of southeast England were hit by torrential rain, causing floods and widespread transport chaos.Five London polling stations opened late as staff struggled to get there, and two closed briefly because of flooding but were quickly re-opened in back-up locations.""In London/southeast and want to vote in the #EURef? Make sure you plan now to get back to your local polling station by 10pm!"" the Electoral Commission said on Twitter, as crowds of frustrated commuters struggled with train cancellations.Among those affected was former London mayor Boris Johnson, a leading voice in the Leave campaign, who cast his vote with just 25 minutes to spare after returning to the capital from his daughter's graduation in Scotland.""Let's see, let's see. It's in the hands of the people now,"" he said when asked how he felt about the vote.CAMERON'S FATEThe Leave campaign focused on warnings that Britain would be unable to control immigration levels as long as it was an EU member. Remain said a Brexit would cause economic chaos, impoverish the nation and reduce its clout on the world stage.The killing of pro-EU lawmaker Jo Cox, a 41-year-old mother of two who was shot and stabbed on a street in her electoral district in northern England a week ago, prompted soul-searching about the vicious tone of the campaign.Her suspected murderer told a court his name was ""Death to traitors, freedom for Britain."" Campaigning was suspended for three days out of respect for Cox, resuming on Sunday.An Ipsos MORI poll for the Evening Standard newspaper found support for Remain on 52 percent and Leave on 48 percent. A Populus poll put Remain 10 points ahead on 55 percent. Both were conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday and published on Thursday.Cameron called the vote in 2013 under pressure from the rebellious anti-EU wing of his Conservative Party and the surging UK Independence Party (UKIP), hoping to end decades of debate over Britain's ties with Europe.Unless Remain wins by a wide margin, he could struggle to repair the rifts in his party and hold on to his job. He has said he would stay in office but in the event of a vote to leave he is likely to face calls to resign.Johnson is the bookmakers' favorite to replace him.A Brexit could also cause the United Kingdom to break up because Scotland, where sentiment towards the EU is much more positive than in England, could hold an independence referendum if it was being dragged out of the EU against its will. Scots voted by 55 to 45 percent against independence in 2014.OBAMA V TRUMPAfter months of non-stop tit-for-tat confrontation between the sides, any substantive debate was over on Thursday. Due to legal restrictions, there were no large-scale campaign events and no television programs rehearsing the arguments.Traders, investors and companies were braced for volatility on financial markets whatever the outcome of a vote that has both reflected, and fueled, an anti-establishment mood also seen in the United States and elsewhere in Europe.Britain is divided on EU membership along broad age and education lines, polls show. Older and less educated voters tend to favor exit and younger voters and those with higher levels of education lean towards staying.Whatever the outcome of the vote, the focus on immigration to Britain, which has increased dramatically in recent years, could worsen frictions in a country where the gap between rich and poor has also been widening.Foreign leaders, from U.S. President Barack Obama to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, have called on Britain to remain in the EU, a message supported by global financial organizations, many company bosses and central bankers.International banks have warned that the value of the pound could fall dramatically if Britain votes to leave and traders expect markets to be more volatile than at any time since the 2008-9 financial crisis.(Additional reporting by Estelle Shirbon, Sarah Young, Ana Nicolaci da Costa, Michael Holden; writing by Mark John; editing by Mark Trevelyan and Guy Faulconbridge)"
