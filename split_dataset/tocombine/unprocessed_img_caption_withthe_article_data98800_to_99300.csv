Officials said benzene levels were too low to pose a short-term health risk but they warned the city's residents against drinking tap water out of precaution. Elevated levels of benzene were found in water samples taken from a treatment plant that serves about 6,000 people in the agricultural community of Glendive near the North Dakota border. The contamination followed a 50,000 gallon oil spill that found its way from a break in a Bridger Pipeline's 12-inch pipeline into the Yellowstone River. (AP Photo/Matthew Brown)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1639a2100002501c7336a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Laura ZuckermanJan 22 (Reuters) - A Montana town's water supply, contaminated by oil from a breached pipeline over the weekend, may be safe for drinking again by Friday, state officials said, after tests showed a drop in concentrations of a cancer-causing petrochemical.The contamination is linked to last Saturday's spill into the Yellowstone River of an estimated 1,200 barrels of crude oil from a pipeline that ruptured several miles upstream of Glendive, in northeastern Montana.Drinking water to some 6,000 people in and around Glendive was found earlier this week to contain benzene, an organic compound in oil and gas, at levels above what is deemed acceptable by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.The so-called Poplar pipeline carries 42,000 barrels of crude a day gathered from producers in eastern Montana and North Dakota. It is unclear what caused the pipeline to break.Responders have so far recovered about 246 barrels of petroleum from the breached pipeline but cleanup efforts in the river have been hampered by the pooling of oil below thick layers of ice.Bridger Pipeline LLC, the oil company behind the pipeline, said field tests of water sampled from the Glendive treatment plant and from fire hydrants in the city showed benzene levels had dropped to levels considered safe, but results must be formally confirmed by an independent laboratory.Meanwhile, Montana environmental officials said on Thursday that tap water could be cleared for drinking and cooking again as early as Friday after test results confirm that it is fit for human consumption.Glendive water users were to be instructed Thursday evening on how to flush their taps of residual contamination in water lines, Bridger spokesman Bill Salvin said.The company has trucked tens of thousands of gallons of bottled water to the city after water sampling earlier this week showed elevated levels of benzene.Studies show rates of leukemia are higher in people chronically exposed to elevated levels of benzene, according to the American Cancer Society.Salvin said the oil company is prepared to continue to distribute bottled water to residents if necessary.About 125 people are involved in the cleanup operation, including contractors hired by Bridger and state and federal environmental and pipeline safety officials.

Hermione Granger knows him as a ""foul, loathsome, evil, little cockroach."" In real life, however, he's actor Tom Felton. Since the last ""Harry Potter"" movie hit theaters in 2011, Felton has appeared in various projects, including ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" ""The Apparition"" and recently coming to TV in ""Murder in the First."" Now, you can see the actor as bombardier Tony Pastula in the upcoming film ""Against the Sun.""The movie tells the true story of three World War II pilots whose plane crash landed in the South Pacific. They had nothing except a small raft, each other and thousands of miles to civilization. Felton recently spoke with HuffPost Entertainment about the role, his time at Hogwarts and even which wizarding houses some famous faces might be sorted into:How do you think you'd do in a real survival situation? Oh my lord, I’d be awful. I mean, the three of us, everyday on set, between Jake Abel, Garret Dillahunt and I, thought how did they do this? Bear in mind, we are on a very strict diet. We had to lose a lot of weight for the job. So just to even imagine what it would’ve been like for these guys to have nothing. It was a real reminder that although we were struggling in our own realm, we had nothing to complain about at all.Wow, so you couldn't eat candy or anything? I didn’t quite understand the diet at first. When they said, you know, you have to eat every two hours, and it has to be just X-amount and Y of this. I had to have daily searches in my hotel to make sure I wasn’t smuggling away treats and chips.Image: Giphy What was the best thing about growing up at Hogwarts? Oh, I mean, where do you start? It’s a hell of a lot more interesting that normal school. I actually went back and forth during my time there from my real secondary school back to Hogwarts, and pretty much everything about Hogwarts is better. I mean, the wardrobe for one. The robes had huge pockets, so I managed to stuff them with candy and chocolate and chips, and, in fact, come the fourth film they sewed the pockets up for most of the cast thanks to me leaving chocolate in there and melting it. So I have sort of a reputation for that. And yeah, still actually as we speak, I'm wearing a pair of Slytherin socks. So yeah, I’m definitely not forgetting about where I came from anytime soon. I have a list of celebs. Think you can sort them in Hogwarts Houses? Okay, I’ll do my best.1. Kim Kardashian Slytherin. For sure. 2. Justin Bieber Ah, wow. I can see a trend coming here. He’s gonna have to join me in Slytherin as well. He’s a bit of a bad boy.3. Taylor Swift Taylor Swift is far too good. We’ll say Gryffindor.4. Ariana Grande Um ... that’d be Ravenclaw. I know she’s a Potter fan. I’m not sure. She seems very sweet. Let’s go Gryffindor again.5. Kanye West Hufflepuff. Definitely. He confuses me a bit, but that’s the house I’d go with. 6. Miley Cyrus Miley Cyrus is definitely part of Slytherin. Absolutely. 7. Harry Styles He seems like a cool guy. I've met him a few times. He’s very sweet. Let’s stick him in Gryffindor I think.8. Gwyneth Paltrow She's Ravenclaw. Very loyal. We'll go with that.9. Pitbull He's got to be a Slytherin. Hasn't he?J.K. Rowling said she was ""unnerved"" by young girls being attracted to Malfoy. What do you think about that? I think it must be an allure for the bad boy. I think people actually hated him for a lot longer. He was the victim in ""Half-Blood Prince."" That kind of maybe changed people’s perceptions about him, gave him a little bit of sympathy. I thought a lot of people liked the black suit. It maybe has something to do with his dapper wardrobe. But yeah I think it’s just everyone loves the bad boy a little bit I guess.Have you ever taken a ""Harry Potter"" character quiz? If so, who did you get? You know what I did. I’m sure it was someone that I did not want to be at all. Not a bit. Filch for some reason. I’m definitely not taking the Pottermore quiz anytime soon for the sorting hat because I’m just too terrified that I’d end up in Gryffindor or something like that. I’m just proclaiming that I’m a Slytherin and that’s the end of it. [Ed. note: For the record, Felton's worst nightmare recently came true.]What was it like being punched by Emma Watson? Uh, pretty hardcore. She’s got a mean right hook, that girl. It was originally a slap I think, so I said, ""Let’s test it out now. Give me a slap and try to work on it,"" meaning give me a screen slap, a fake slap. But she actually smacked me on the face pretty hard, and I walked away from that rather listening impaired with my tail tucked between my legs.Image: Giphy  What was your favorite line? The one the fans seems to come back with is, ""My father will hear about this."" They like that one. Anything with the word ""Potter"" in it. The one about the hippogriff, ""Bloody pigeon,"" I believe is a fun one. I like that. Was it weird adjusting to Muggle life after the movies? Not so much immediately. I really honestly thought that the ""Harry Potter"" flame would die after the film stuff. So it’s just seemingly getting more and more popular as the years are going on. And it doesn’t seem like fans are tiring of it anytime soon. It’s fantastic. What was your favorite moment from filming? It really is impossible to pick one. I met my girlfriend of seven years on the set at the Great Hall. She was playing an extra one day. So that’s pretty special. That, and I’d say getting to have a good wand fight in the bathroom with Daniel was pretty fun. We spent the day in there blowing the hell out of that place, so that was a lot of fun.Are you really a wizard? I don’t want to say because I don’t want to ruin fans’ expectations. I gotta keep it quiet. Only at Hogwarts. Image: Giphy""Against the Sun"" opens in theaters and on nationwide VOD on Jan. 23. This interview has been edited and condensed."

Thirty-one percent of Catholics and nine percent of the religiously unaffiliated agree.Two weeks before the 2014 Super Bowl, half of American sports fans said they believed God or a supernatural force had a hand in the games they watched, according to a PRRI study at the time. Included in that percentage were the 26 percent of Americans who pray for God to help their team, 25 percent who think their team has been cursed and 19 percent who believe more generally that God is involved in determining who wins on the court or in the field.Super Bowl excitement aside, 25 percent of Americans say that on any given Sunday they are more likely to be in church than watching football. The same amount say they manage to do both, while 32 percent have other plans entirely.Come Super Bowl Sunday, 184 million Americans are expected to watch the game.

It's become so popular with the adult masses that today's teenagers find it lame (which makes me feel ancient and lame, myself).These days it's mostly a telephone and email replacement for extended family updates. Aunt Judy up in Michigan can see how sweet Bobby and Sally are doing without leaving the comfort of her couch.It's a dumping ground for Instagrammed pictures of people's kids, dinner, and anything else they happen to take a picture of that day. It's confused itself into thinking it's Twitter, and added the ability to use hashtags. It's where people feel comfortable airing their political and religious beliefs and end up getting into comment arguments with that guy from high school they barely remember, but accepted his friend request anyway.Yeah, Facebook is annoying. It's overused and overexposed.But, for parents of children who have rare diseases or disorders, special equipment, body differences, or something that makes them extra unique... it's the most precious invention, ever.Seriously. Thank you, Mark Zuckerberg. I don't think you actually know what Facebook means to these parents.It means never feeling alone.Learning your child has been diagnosed (finally) is exhilarating, and absolutely terrifying, particularly when it's with something you have never heard of, and neither has anyone else.Guess what? There's a Facebook group for that.My daughter was diagnosed with an extremely rare, random and downright weird neurological disorder. Doctors had barely heard of it, and had never seen it. Yet, when doing research on it myself, I found a closed Facebook group of parents with similarly affected kids.These parents shared their experiences. They shared photos. They asked for advice, and received feedback. For the last two years that I have been a part of this group, I have watched people post their worries and concerns, as well as their happiness over their kids' triumphs.One tiny app on my phone, and suddenly, I'm not alone. These are people who share my fears about everything her diagnosis entails. And, now, with our second's array of medical issues, I have added four new groups in the last week, each one alleviating at least some of the anxiety I feel for what the future holds for him.I can talk to and ask questions of people who are going through the same things, even though they may sit in Australia. Videos, pictures, documents, surveys of symptoms; the resources are endless.For a special needs parent, it's like being thrown a lifeline. Suddenly, there's a place you can go at 2:00 a.m., and ask for help when you're unsure whether a symptom is normal or not.And, when you're scared for your kid, and your friends can't understand the depth of that, having that safe place of understanding people to vent to is like finding gold.Thanks, Mark Zuckerberg.

The B Team business alliance began talks on Plan B with unions and civil society on rights, decent work and climate action.These acts signal a change. But ultimately the global system remains broken.The world needs a new business model. The one we have is corrupted. It puts workers at risks, families at risk, economies at risk -- the very nature of capitalism is at risk.The global economy works well for 100 million people, but it isn't working for six billion people. The ITUC Global Poll found only one out of two people believes that the next generation will find a decent job. Demand and jobs are falling, and deflation in Europe will cost only more jobs.Investing in infrastructure, along with co-ordinated wage increases, could create 33 million jobs in G20 countries alone.One in two working families cannot keep up with the rising cost of living. In the United States, over 40 per cent of the workforce will be earning less than $12 an hour in five years from now. The outlook for 2015 is bad for growth and jobs.Economies are burdened by an increasing number of risks not yet measured by the ratings agencies and the bond markets. Democracy, trust and tolerance are pillars of the global economy, and decent work, fair wages and social protection are foundations of the security needed for the global economy to flourish.We need a business model where companies don't pay people poverty wages.We need a business model where supply chains ensure decent work and fair wages, not poverty wages and insecure, unsafe and informal work.We need a business model where all businesses pay tax where they earn their wealth.Instead, the incentive model that drives too many businesses today is withering companies from within. It is destroying the very investment needed to build a strong stable economy on which capitalism rests.The new trend of share buybacks is a perverse incentive whereby CEOs spend trillions on share buybacks rather than investing in employees and capital. It is withering away the workers that business needs in order to grow.The CEO package of stock options and bonuses is destroying the very investment needed to build jobs, businesses and economies. Share buybacks by companies reached record levels last year, U.S. companies spent nearly $2 trillion in the last five years buying back their own shares, and similar numbers were reported in the UK.The share buyback binge leaves workers in the cold, damages economies and shows the true cost of CEO pay packages.Davos awakenings may shock investors, business leaders and politicians with new ideas, but the changes to our business model need to take place in the boardrooms. Returning to catatonia is not an option."

Marketed as ""the biggest night in LGBT music,"" the OMAs almost didn't happen. About three days before the awards show was to be held at New York City's Town Hall Theater, OMAs Executive Director Diedra Meredith was forced to notify the public that the ceremony was postponed for reasons that remain undisclosed. In its place Meredith presented an intimate reception for honorees at the W New York Times Square, where she underscored the challenges facing the LGBT music movement. ""This is what struggle looks like,"" she told the gathering of tastemakers and nominees. ""Financially this community has not received equivalent funding like mainstream industries get from corporate sponsors.""But funding hasn't been the only issue plaguing the awards show. In 2010, pop culture columnist Michael Musto wrote a scathing review of the OMAs that questioned the organization's professional reputation. In the column he highlighted several instances of miscommunication, lack of organization, and even an alleged onstage fight. For many the postponement of this year's OMAs will further call into question the organization's professionalism and ability to produce a viable awards show. Yet, for others it remains worthy of supporting as one of the few avenues of exposure for LGBT music artists.Openly gay rapper Tavon who has been a member of the OMAs for the past year falls into the latter category. ""It makes me want to invest much more,"" he said. ""The entertainment business is not easy especially when it is an organization focused on the LGBT voice.""

For Carter, the OMA honor reflected the MLK Day message of pursuing social justice. ""Equality is a fight we have to fight unfortunately,"" she said. ""But here we are and we are doing a really good job. I am proud to be acknowledged for my part.""Even though she lives in Miami, Deborah Cox still made the trip to NYC to accept the Pillar Award. As an ally to the LGBT community, Cox revealed that she catered to the LGBT audience against her record label's wishes after the success of her club dance remix to the 1996 hit ""Who Do You Love."" Deborah Cox/Credit: Rowena Husbands""A lot of people think it was calculated, but it wasn't. The song resonated with the community, and I supported that because they showed love. So I would do clubs and things even though the label didn't understand and they didn't support it back then,"" she shared.With the support shown to her by artists such as Tavon, Carter and Cox, Meredith is committed to forging ahead in her quest to celebrate LGBT music and raise its profile. The OMAs plan to return with a full-scale awards show this spring, and the organization is currently filming a documentary about the rise of LGBT music, titled For Which WE Stand (One Queer Music Nation in the Visible). For Meredith now is the perfect time for the OMAs to grow in an age of openly LGBT artists from various musical genres such as Sam Smith, Frank Ocean, and Azealia Banks. ""I think this generation is so about who we are. We hold the key to our own freedom by stepping out and being authentically ourselves. This generation is so fierce, and I am glad to be in the position to usher this moment,"" she said.

There were human rights issues to address but also a great optimism. I returned in April 2014, and found my hopes shattered.Then, I was made hopeful by discussions with South Sudan's leaders on discrimination and violence against women. The president and senior officials seemed committed to supporting girls' empowerment and education, and accepted that the rule of law, based on a good human rights system, as being fundamental to a properly functioning democracy.I returned to South Sudan in April 2014, four months after tensions within the county's ruling party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), boiled over into armed conflict in the capital, Juba. Violence spread rapidly among security forces, with civilians targeted based on their ethnicity or assumed political affiliation. Armed thugs roamed the countryside raping women and children, and taking them as sex slaves. My hopes were shattered.The ruthlessness of sexual violence in South Sudan brings back memories of Rwanda. In 1998, while serving as a judge on the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, my colleagues and I heard horrendous stories of mass rapes and other sexual crimes. I was moved by the testimony of victims who said that rape destroyed their physical and psychological health as well as life itself.In our judgement in the case of The Prosecutor vs. Jean Paul Akayesu, we held that sexual violence in war could constitute genocide and crimes against humanity, as well as torture. We found that sexual violence was used as an instrument of war aimed at the systematic destruction of Tutsi women and the Tutsi group as a whole.While South Sudan is not experiencing genocide, the levels of sexual violence are no less shocking. Zainab Bangura, the UN's envoy for sexual violence in conflict, recently said she has not witnessed a situation worse than South Sudan in her 30 years' experience. She can draw comparisons with Liberia, Somalia, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and Bosnia, where women's bodies were weapons in the frontlines of conflict.One of the main reasons we are seeing such extreme sexual violence in South Sudan is the country's pervasive culture of impunity. The perpetrators - - including members of the police, army and armed militias -- know that there is no rigorous justice system and almost no risk of consequences. Unless this changes, the frequency and brutality of sexual violence will rise, as one cycle of violence fuels the next.For those seeking justice, accountability and an end to the country's longstanding culture of impunity, the African Union's commission of inquiry on South Sudan is a beacon of light.Under the leadership of former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, the commission's final report is expected to be a damning document that details countless human rights violations and even lists names of those recommended for trial. This is what the beginnings of accountability should look like.Madame Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the chairperson of the African Union Commission, is to be commended for her leadership in forming the first-ever African Union investigation of mass human rights violations on our continent. Now she faces an even bigger challenge to see life breathed into the commission's recommendations. It is critical that the African Union Peace and Security Council make Obasanjo's report public and act upon its recommendation to establish a credible accountability mechanism for South Sudan. If the report is buried or watered down, the hope created by the appointment of the commission will die, and impunity will continue to reign.We need accountability and justice to stem the tide of human rights abuses spreading across much of South Sudan. The threat of criminal prosecution can act as a powerful deterrent and may even help convince the warring parties they have more gain by laying down their guns and committing to the (more difficult) task of making peace and rebuilding their country. There have been tremendous advances in tackling impunity for serious crimes over the past 20 years, in particular through the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Cambodia and the International Criminal Court (ICC). While international and national accountability processes have contributed immensely to challenging impunity for violations of international law, such efforts on their own cannot stop the cycle completely. Political will on the part of governments is essential, and usually constitutes the biggest obstacle. If the government of South Sudan is not willing or able to put a stop to this insidious form of violence that targets women and girls, the international community has a responsibility to step in. As African heads of state and AU officials convene in Addis Ababa for the 24th AU Summit this month, they must do all they can to ensure that the report from Obasanjo's commission of inquiry represents the beginning of the end of impunity in South Sudan."

But that doesn’t mean the party isn’t changing — it’s just not changing in a way that’s always visible to the naked eye. In fact, the GOP is undergoing a kind of evolution as it figures out how to maintain unity among its pro-business, social conservative and libertarian factions. Those dividing lines are going to be on sharp display as the 2016 presidential campaigns gear up.Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is, of course, the poster child for the libertarian movement within the party, but he’s not the only one embracing a more laissez-faire attitude on certain issues, such as drugs and gay marriage, that social conservatives abhor. More mainstream Republicans, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, also offer some crossover appeal on social issues. Paul lines up with the pro-business side in supporting President Barack Obama’s recent moves to ease the long-standing embargo on Cuba. Where they diverge is on spending, particularly on government programs that benefit the business community. There, the right wing and the libertarian movement are on the same page, happy to whack away at spending even at the expense of businesses.The growing power of libertarian ideas in the Republican Party is no flash in the pan, according to anti-tax icon Grover Norquist. Rather, libertarianism is “a long-term trend with no obvious roadblock in sight,” he writes in an OZY op-ed. Paul, in other words, is just the beginning.And that’s not the only new breed of Republican trying to shake up the party. Outside Washington, OZY has found some young conservatives eager to bring a fresh voice to a political brand not known for being terribly plugged into the cadences of youth. Marilinda Garcia of New Hampshire, a harpist in her early 30s, didn’t win her election to Congress this fall, but she proved a far more formidable candidate than most people expected. Another 30-something, San Jose policeman Scott Erickson, is also making waves with his outspoken conservative stances on policing, privacy and counterterrorism. But they’re both veterans compared to 12-year-old Coreco Pearson Jr., who’s campaigning to lower Georgia’s age requirement for running for office. Is this the future of the GOP? Hard to say. What is true is that the party’s direction is going to be hashed out before our very eyes over the next couple of years. And with these types of people in the mix, it will be well worth watching."

A court had already dropped other graft charges against the sons in November.Egypt has witnessed rare street anti-government protests before the anniversary of the popular revolt that ended three decades of iron-fisted rule under Mubarak and raised hopes of greater freedom and accountability.Tensions have been rising for the first time in months.On Thursday, security forces quickly dispersed protesters in downtown Cairo after a similar incident on Wednesday night in the same area.Muslim Brotherhood supporters blocked traffic in Egypt's second city of Alexandria on Thursday and hurled Molotov cocktails, security sources said. Thirteen people were arrested.The army, led at the time by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, removed the Brotherhood from power in 2013 after mass protests against their rule. It has since mounted a tough crackdown on the Islamist movement.Sisi, who served as Mubarak's military intelligence chief, went on to become Egypt's elected president.In November, a court dropped charges against Mubarak of conspiring to kill protesters in the 2011 uprising, raising fears among human rights activists that the old guard was making a comeback.Last May, the 86-year-old former president received a three-year sentence and both sons were jailed for four years in a case in which all were charged with diverting public funds to upgrade family properties.It was not immediately clear why the court did not also order Mubarak's release on Thursday as he awaits retrial on these charges along with the sons.Suffering from ill health, Mubarak has been serving his sentence in a military hospital in the upscale Maadi district of Cairo.

Previous requests have been denied by U.S. District Judge George O'Toole, after prosecutors argued jury selection would be a challenge anywhere in the United States.Some 85 percent of prospective jurors screened have said they either believe Tsarnaev is guilty, or have some self-identified connection to the case, according to documents filed by Tsarnaev's defense on Thursday in support of the new change of venue motion.""Great local prejudice will prevent a fair trial by an impartial jury in violation of Mr. Tsarnaev's constitutional rights to due process of law and a fair trial,"" the documents said.Prosecutors say Tsarnnaev, 21, and his older brother Tamerlan worked together on the bombing, and that the ethnic Chechens were influenced by radical Islam. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police days after the bombing.A new proposed date for the start of opening statements in the case is expected to be released next week, the court said.

Government figures released on Thursday show the country lost a record 1,215 rhinos last year, about a 20 percent increase on the 2013 toll, with 49 slain so far this year.The animals are being poached to meet soaring demand for rhino horn, coveted as an ingredient in traditional medicine in fast-growing economies such as China and Vietnam.South Africa said in August that it planned to relocate rhinos from poaching ""hot spots"" in the famed Kruger National Park, where about two-thirds of the killings take place.Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa told a news briefing that for security reasons, the precise countries where the rhinos had been moved would not be named.Conservationists have said Botswana is a likely candidate as it is vast, sparsely populated and has had little poaching. Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries where many of the poachers hail from, would almost certainly be off the list.Molewa said that 56 of the animals had been moved within the Kruger itself, which is the size of Israel, from danger zones to an ""intensive protection zone.""In 2015, another 200 rhinos will be moved from Kruger to what Molewa said were ""strongholds"" where the animals will be safer from poaching. Kruger's rhino population is around 9,000.Twenty bids have been received to purchase the animals and are being evaluated. The money raised will be put back into conservation projects.Private ranchers own around 5,000 of South Africa's roughly 20,000 rhinos, part of a thriving game farming industry in Africa's most advanced economy catering to eco-toursim and hunting.Rhino horn -- the sale of which is strictly prohibited -- is estimated by conservationists to be worth around $65,000 a kg, more than gold or platinum, and so 25 tonnes could fetch an estimated $1.6 billion.

When asked by pollsters who causes more problems in the federal government — 'elected officials who are not willing to stand up for their principles or elected officials who are not willing to compromise' — 71 percent of self-identifying Democrats blamed officials who are not willing to compromise, whereas just 40 percent of Republicans agreed.

[Al Jazeera America]OBAMA'S INCREASED RATINGS ARE LARGELY THANKS TO INDEPENDENTS - Philip Bump: ""Earlier this month, we looked at the narrow range in which Obama's approval has hovered since 2009. That's largely because Republicans strongly oppose the president and Democrats mostly approve -- meaning that shifts are a function of independent voters changing their minds. You can see that in this graph, which shows how approval of the economy and of the president have shifted over time….Look at the yellow line. That's independents. And over the last two Post/ABC polls (since last September), they've grown much more approving of the economy and Obama. Notice how much wider the bar is for independents than for Democrats -- or, especially, Republicans. That's why the 'all voters' bar isn't very wide, meaning there's only been a small uptick in overall approval: Independents make up less of the population. But the movement among that group has clearly been correlated to increased economic satisfaction....[T]he layer of politics that has kept approval of Obama constrained for years also means that the benefits of an improving economy are themselves likely dampened. By now, this is what we've come to expect."" [WashPost]CLINTON LEADS POSSIBLE RIVALS BY DOUBLE DIGITS - Anne Gearan and Peyton M. Craighill: ""Hillary Rodham Clinton holds double-digit leads over potential Republican challengers Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney as the likely Democratic presidential candidate moves closer to entering the race, a new Washington Post-ABC News poll finds. Although Clinton, Bush and Romney are all longtime politicians and members of political dynasties, registered voters are less likely to count that familiarity against Clinton. That is a good sign for Clinton, a failed 2008 presidential candidate and the focus of Republican criticism that her time has come and gone. Clinton’s potential to make history as the first female U.S. president makes little difference to most voters and is a net positive for others.""

Another 10% are dissatisfied, but don't have a preference for whether there should be more or less acceptance….The general trend suggests that over time, fewer Americans are dissatisfied because they want less tolerance, and more classify themselves as satisfied. The percentage who are dissatisfied because they want more tolerance has remained fairly stable.

The Eurozone group of nations is threatened by potential deflation and many analysts are counting on the ECB to take proactive measures, including a bond-buying initiative.

The flood of money impressed markets: the euro fell more than two U.S. cents to $1.14108 on the announcement, and European shares hit seven-year highs.""All eyes were on Mario Draghi and he has delivered a bigger bazooka than investors were expecting,"" said Mauro Vittorangeli, a fixed income specialist at Allianz Global Investors, adding that the news marked ""an historic crossroads for European markets.""The ECB and the central banks of euro zone countries will buy up bonds in proportion to its ""capital key,"" meaning more debt will be scooped up from the biggest economies such as Germany than from small member states such as Ireland.The prospect of dramatic ECB action had already prompted the Swiss central bank to abandon its cap on the franc against the euro. Denmark cut its main policy interest rate on Thursday for the second time this week after the ECB announcement, aiming to defend the Danish crown's peg to the euro.Draghi has had to balance the need for action to lift the euro zone economy out of its torpor against German concerns about risk-sharing and that it might be left to foot the bill.WILL IT WORK?Economists noted that Draghi had said only 20 percent of purchases would be the responsibility of the ECB. This means the bulk of any potential losses, should a euro zone government default on its debt, would fall on national central banks.Critics say this casts doubt over the unity of the euro zone and its principle of solidarity, and countries with already high debts could find themselves in yet deeper water.""It is counterproductive to shift the risks of monetary policy to the national central banks,"" said former ECB policymaker Athanasios Orphanides. ""It does not promote a single monetary policy. This path towards Balkanisation of monetary policy would signal that the ECB is preparing for a break-up of the euro.""A German lawyer who has been prominent in attempts to halt euro zone bailouts said he was already preparing a legal complaint against the bond-buying program.Draghi said the ECB's Governing Council had been unanimous in agreeing that the step to print money was legally sound. There was a large majority on the need to trigger it now, ""so large that we didn't need to take a vote.""""There was a consensus on risk-sharing set at 20 percent and 80 percent on a no-risk-sharing basis,"" he added.One euro zone central banking source said five policymakers opposed the expanded asset-purchase plan: the central bank chiefs of Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Estonia, along with Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger, a German.Guntram Wolff, head of the Bruegel think tank, said the plan's size was impressive. ""But the ECB has given the signal ... that its monetary policy is not a single one. That's a bad signal to markets and a bad signal to everybody in the euro zone.""The ECB is trying to push euro zone annual inflation back up to its target of just below two percent; consumer prices fell last month, raising fears of a Japanese-style deflationary spiral. But there are doubts, and not only in Germany, over whether printing fresh money will work.Most euro zone government bond yields are at ultra-low levels and the euro had already dropped sharply against the dollar. Lower borrowing costs and a weaker currency could both help to boost economic growth but there is a question about how much further either can fall.The ECB could create the basis for growth, Draghi said, but he put the onus on governments to follow. ""For growth to pick up ... you need structural reforms,"" he said. ""It's now up to the governments to implement these structural reforms. The more they do, the more effective will be our monetary policy.""Draghi was echoing the view of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said: ""Regardless of what the ECB does, it should not obscure the fact that the real growth impulses must come from conditions set by the politicians.""The ECB has already cut interest rates to record lows and left its refinancing rate, which determines the cost of euro zone credit, at 0.05 percent.Greece and Cyprus, which remain under EU/IMF bailout programs, will be eligible for the ECB program but subject to stricter conditions.In practice, Greek debt does not currently qualify as another rule stipulates that a maximum 33 percent of the bonds issued by any country may be bought. The ECB and other euro zone central banks already own more than this, although they may start purchases once enough of their Greek bonds have matured to take the total below the 33 percent threshold.Greece votes on Sunday in an election where anti-bailout opposition party Syriza is on track to emerge as the biggest party in parliament.($1 = 0.8752 euros) (Writing by Mike Peacock and Paul Carrel.

Detainees were housed in open air pens until the completion of Camp Delta in April 2002. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea3591f0000250122fd4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Barack Obama once again called for the U.S. to shut down the military prison at Guantánamo, Cuba. Most human rights advocates would agree that jailing people indefinitely without trial, at times in solitary confinement or other harsh conditions, is hard to justify. The biggest problem with Obama's call to close the military prison at Gitmo is that it doesn't go far enough. Few symbols stand as such a potent reminder that in Latin America, for more than a century and particularly in the context of the Cold War, the U.S. has often stood against the side of freedom, democracy and self-determination. Instead, it has repeatedly attempted to force its will on the region through economic pressure, political destabilization and, when all else failed, military might. The U.S. invaded or intervened militarily in Cuba alone at least four times over the last 120 years -- in 1898, in 1906, in 1917 and in 1961. Over the same 120-year period, the U.S. invaded Mexico, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic (twice), Haiti (twice) and Panama, while helping to topple or destabilize governments in Chile, Brazil, Argentina and Nicaragua. The U.S. also backed violent dictatorships in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Guatemala, El Salvador, Chile, Argentina... you get the idea. Obama has played down this ugly past at times in his addresses to Latin American leaders, preferring to focus on how to improve the future. When refusing, for example, to apologize for the role the U.S. played in overthrowing the democratically elected government of Chile during a press conference in 2009, he said, ""I'm interested in going forward, not looking backward."" He was standing next to Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, whose father was killed by the Augusto Pinochet military dictatorship that the U.S. helped usher into power. Bachelet herself was jailed and tortured by the same government. But let's take Obama's advice and think about how to improve the future. As Cuba expert Julia Sweig has argued before, the United States shouldn't just shut the military prison at Guantánamo down -- it should give that chunk of land back to Cuba. The most obvious reason to let Gitmo go is that it undermines otherwise legitimate demands from U.S. policymakers for Cuba to respect human rights. Some 122 detainees remain at the military prison in Gitmo, a figure that tops the 114 prisoners of conscience in Cuban jail cells identified by the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. While the commission's figure doesn't include the thousands of Cubans dissidents detained for short periods of time for political reasons, seeing Cuba hold fewer political prisoners in its jails than the U.S. holds detainees at the notorious Gitmo prison makes it hard to take U.S. human rights rhetoric seriously. The base's lack of legitimacy offers an equally good reason to give the territory back. Many have raised objections to the fact that the United States is indefinitely detaining people without charges at the military prison in Gitmo. Fewer people seem to wonder why we have a military base at all in a country with which, until last month, the U.S. did not even have diplomatic relations. The military base was founded shortly after the United States invaded Cuba in 1898, effectively occupying the country at the tail end of a three-decade-long, Cuban-led series of wars for independence. As a condition for withdrawing, the United States required the new Cuban government to allow the U.S. to build a naval base there. It made perfect sense for an aspiring imperial power. At the time, military dominance meant controlling the seas. To maintain the fiction that the United States had acquired the base legitimately, the U.S. government created a system by which the U.S. paid an annual fee to ""lease"" the property. The so-called lease can only be terminated by ""mutual consent,"" which sounds suspiciously similar to a military occupation that continues despite Cuba's protest. The State Department still sends Cuba the un-updated sum of $4,085 every year to rent the land for the base, which the Castro government refuses to cash. Today, the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo is all but irrelevant for purposes of combat, according to former head of U.S. Southern Command, retired Admiral Jim Stavridis. The U.S. isn't fighting any wars in the Americas right now, and despite occasional saber rattling from those who want to portray Cuba, or Venezuela, or Ecuador, or Bolivia, or -- most laughably -- Nicaragua as a national security threat, a war in the Western hemisphere doesn't seem very likely in the near future. If a war did unexpectedly break out, victory probably wouldn't hinge on controlling the waterways of the Caribbean to protect against enemy battleships because this isn't 1914.There's nothing noble about the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo, let alone the military prison. Obama should do more than shut it down. He should give the territory back to Cuba, its rightful owner.This post is part of a Huffington Post blog series called ""90 Miles: Rethinking the Future of U.S.-Cuba Relations.""

Indeed, in a speech at the Virginia Constitutional Convention in December 1829, James Madison said: ""The essence of government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.""It is with this in mind that we turn to a recent op-ed in The New York Times co-authored by David N. Cicilline, a Democratic representative from Rhode Island and Scott Rigell, a Republican representative from Virginia. Entitled ""Teach Congress a Lesson"", it makes a compelling, thought-provoking case for the need for mandatory ethics training for Congressional members.It isn't difficult to understand why. As the article aptly points out, Congress' approval ratings have gone ""from bad to worse to outright terrible"", having dropped to 15 percent from 40 percent in 10 years -- close to the record-low yearly average of 14 percent in 2013.Furthermore, the number of disciplinary actions filed against congressional members by the House Ethics Committee has quadrupled since 2008.The article also cites an oft-overlooked issue that is becoming increasingly prevalent among those in power -- namely, ""the perception that lawmakers believe the rules don't apply to them.""Needless to say, the mere idea that members of Congress should be required to take annual ethics training speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from our founders' values, but may be necessary as a first step toward restoring decency and respectability in our nation's capital. As Mrs. Cicilline and Rigell state, it is a ""simple, common-sense"" step and a reminder to congressmen that they have a responsibility to lead by example, beginning with their actions and behavior both in their private and pubic lives.As Samuel Adams once said, ""He who is void of virtuous attachments in private life is, or very soon will be, void of all regard for his country. There is seldom an instance of a man guilty of betraying his country, who had not before lost the feeling of moral obligations in his private connections.""Morality. Virtue. And propriety. Such seemingly simple notions that are often thoughtlessly bandied about. Yet, when decent behavior and good form are neglected in the private and public sphere, the consequences can be utterly profound. How astute Thomas Jefferson was to say that: ""A nation, as a society, forms a moral person, and every member of it is personally responsible for his society.""And so, with the 114th Congress now in session, it is our hope that leaders and common folk alike will take to heart the following words, spoken nearly 140 years ago by James Garfield, the 20th president of the United States -- words which are more critical today than any other time in our history:""Now more than ever before, the people are responsible for the character of their Congress. If that body be ignorant, reckless and corrupt, it is because the people tolerate ignorance, recklessness and corruption. If it be intelligent, brave and pure, it is because the people demand these high qualities to represent them in the national legislature...If the next centennial does not find us a great nation...it will be because those who represent the enterprise, the culture, and the morality of the nation do not aid in controlling the political forces.""I'll vote for that."
25,POLITICS,Republicans Wage Last-Minute Campaign To Undermine Net Neutrality Rules,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/net-neutrality_n_6519456.html,,2015-01-22,"UNITED STATES - NOVEMBER 13: Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., participates in the press conference announcing House GOP leadership for upcoming session of Congress on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2014. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e5322100004202c969ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Republicans are waging a last-minute campaign to gather support for net neutrality legislation that critics say will undermine the principles of a free and open Internet. A draft proposal, circulated last week by Republican lawmakers in the House and the Senate, appears to to take a firm stance in support of net neutrality. It claims to impose regulations on consumer broadband Internet that net neutrality supporters have long advocated for, but critics say the bill is written in a way that will fail to uphold equal Internet access.The legislation is an effort to head off a Federal Communications Commission vote next month about regulations on consumer broadband.President Barack Obama, who supports stronger regulations, has asked the FCC to reclassify broadband Internet under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, a move that would allow the agency to prevent Internet providers from charging customers for better Internet access. The FCC is expected to favor reclassification in next month's vote, although the agency is certain to face lawsuits from cable and telecom companies if it does so. A provision in the Republican-sponsored bill would stop the FCC from making the reclassification, undercutting the agency's ability to do what Obama has requested.In House and Senate committee hearings on Wednesday, Democrats expressed open skepticism of the proposal and its potential loopholes. “There’s a lot of things in the Republican draft proposal that are non-starters,” Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) told The Huffington Post in an interview. “I’m worried about the most vibrant, competitive part of our economy getting hamstrung.” “I get the sense there is no consensus to move this legislation right now,” she added.But former FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell was much more optimistic, contending that the bill has no problematic loopholes. “The FCC should hit the pause button, I think there’s actually some traction here potentially for bipartisan solutions,” he told HuffPost. “This is the first time I’ve ever seen Congress this close to actually passing a bill,” McDowell added.Though the proposal offers many concessions to net neutrality advocates, critics maintain that it still fails to uphold important net neutrality principles. According to an analysis published on Tuesday by Barbara van Schewick, director of Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society, the legislation “provides network neutrality in name only.”“The bill is so narrowly written that it fails to adequately protect users, innovators, and speakers against blocking, discrimination, and access fees,” she and co-author Morgan N. Weiland, a J.D./Ph.D. candidate at Stanford Law School, wrote.Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), the chairman of the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee, accused the FCC of preparing to invoke the “nuclear option” by approving reclassification. “What we are offering today is a solution that will bring to an end the loop of litigation and legal gymnastics,” he said at Wednesday's House hearing. In an interview with HuffPost, Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) said the issue was about “government control versus, really, freedom.” He added, “Our concern is Title II, giving the FCC this authority.” At the Senate hearing, Paul Misener, vice president for global public policy at Amazon, testified that he approved of the draft's principles, but said that for them to be ""meaningful to consumers, they need to be effective."" Misener noted a number of ways in which the draft could be interpreted to ""undermine that effectiveness."" Amazon is part of a coalition of technology companies that has previously supported net neutrality.""Any solution has to meet the goals of protecting consumers and innovation, and the discussion draft hits all of the hallmarks from prior Democratic proposals,"" House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said in a statement provided to HuffPost following the hearings. ""Today’s discussion was a good start, and we look forward to engaging with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to produce a sustainable, bipartisan solution.”Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) also told HuffPost said that he doesn’t support the Title II option and thinks that it qualifies as overreach.In a statement, Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said he believed the legislation remains “fair to everyone.” But he acknowledged, “Some of my colleagues across the aisle are still unhappy.” Yet the legislation's backers will have to win over not only Democrats, but also skeptical Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has said he doesn't want any regulation of the Internet whatsoever.  "

The move infuriated business lobbies, which claim the reforms will infringe on employers' free speech rights, while unions hail them as commonsense changes that will help workers vote in a timely manner.The new GOP-controlled Congress has already signaled that it intends to pursue legislation aimed at neutering the NLRB, which is tasked with enforcing labor law on unions and employers. Business groups, meanwhile, have sued to gut the reforms.In a letter to be sent to the NLRB on Thursday, 16 Democratic senators wrote that they ""applaud"" the board for pursuing the rules change. Democratic support in the upper chamber could be critical in avoiding a future budget bill rider that would block the reforms, should Republicans try to go that route.""American workers gained the right to collectively bargain and unionize nearly 80 years ago, and out of these rights grew the American middle class,"" says the letter, which was provided to HuffPost. ""It is critical that we preserve these rights for the benefit of American workers and our national economy. Workers deserve to have a union representation election process that is free of stalling tactics and intimidation. These new NLRB rules will reinforce that right.""The letter was written by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and signed by 14 of their colleagues.Although the election reforms are just procedural changes, they could make it significantly easier for workers to unionize. Before an election, businesses often spend time disputing which workers would be covered by the proposed bargaining unit. But under the new rules, that dispute will be postponed until after the election, making it harder for employers to drag out the process. The reforms will also speed up elections by allowing unions to file election petitions and other documents via email. In addition, employers will have to provide unions with the email addresses and phone numbers of workers eligible to vote.The five members of the labor board are all appointed by the president, though by tradition three of them come from the president's party and two from the other party. The new election rules were approved 3-2, with the two Republican members dissenting. The rules are slated to go into effect in April.The board first proposed the rules three years ago. Republicans have hammered the changes as opening the door for ""ambush"" or ""quickie"" elections, while business groups twice challenged them in court. The first of those challenges was successful, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruling that the board lacked a proper quorum when it devised the rules. The NLRB withdrew and later reissued the reforms. Now, with the rules put forth by a fully confirmed board, the business lobby's case faces much longer odds.Declaring that the reforms will ""modernize"" the union election process, the Democratic senators urged board members to push ahead despite the latest lawsuit.""We believe this rule will restore balance and certainty to the union election process and strongly encourage you to vigorously defend this rule in the face of such challenges,"" the senators wrote."

Wilmore said.Wilmore called Cosby's current tour the “tone-deaf comedy jam” -- referencing the actual title, ""Far From Finished"" -- and called out those who argue how many women have come forward to talk about Cosby's alleged abuse. “Now, to be fair, the number is changing so quickly that there are conflicting reports on whether the total really is 34 or 35,” Wilmore said, “but if the difference between 34 and 35 women matters to you, please fuck off forever.”"
