It felt sweet to sit there with him. And yet -- even though I was feeling fine and had plenty of time, there was this internal pressure to start zipping along with emails and calls and all the other clamoring minutiae of the day.You see the irony. We rush about as a means to an end: as a method for getting results in the form of good experiences, such as relaxation and happiness. Hanging out with our cat, I was afloat in good experiences. But the autopilot inside the coconut still kept trying to suck me back into methods for getting relaxation and happiness -- as if I weren't already feeling that way! And of course, by jumping up and diving into doingness, I'd break the mood and lose the relaxation and happiness... that is the point of doingness.Sometimes we do need to rush. Maybe you've got to get your kid to school on time, or your boss really has to have that report by end of day. OK.But much of the time, we rev up and race about because of unnecessary internal pressures (like unrealistic standards for ourselves) or because external forces are trying to hurry us along for their own purposes (not because of our own needs).How do you feel when you're rushing? Perhaps there's a bit of positive excitement, but if you're like me, there's mostly, if not entirely, a sense of tension, discomfort, and anxiety. This kind of stress isn't pleasant for the mind, and over time it's really bad for the body. Plus there's a loss of autonomy: The rush is pushing you one way or another rather than you yourself deciding where you want to go and at what pace.Instead, how about stepping aside from the rush as much as you can? And into your own well-being, health, and autonomy?How?For starters, be mindful of rushing -- your own and others. See how other people assume deadlines that aren't actually real, or get time-pressured and intense about things that aren't that important. (And yep, you get to decide for yourself what you think is real or important.) Notice the internal ""should""s or ""must""s or simply habits that speed you up.Then, when the demands of others bear down upon you, buy yourself time -- what the psychologist and Buddhist teacher Tara Brach calls ""the sacred pause"" -- in order to create a space in which you are free to choose how you will respond. Are you letting the rushing of others become your own? Slow down the conversation, ask questions, and find out what's really true. Consider the sign I once saw in a car repair shop: ""Your lack of planning is not my emergency.""On your own side of the street, try not to create ""emergencies"" for yourself. You can get a lot done at your own pace without rushing; plan ahead and don't procrastinate until you're forced into hurrying. More fundamentally, be realistic about your own resources. It's a kind of modesty, a healthy humility, to finally admit to yourself and maybe others that you can't carry five quarts in a one-gallon bucket. There are 168 hours in a week, not 169. It's also a kind of healthy renunciation, relinquishment, to set down the ego, drivenness, appetite, or ambition that overcommits and sets you up for rushing. And it's a matter of seeing clearly what is, a matter of being in reality rather than being confused or, in a sense, deluded.Nkosi Johnson was the South African boy born with HIV who became a national advocate for children with AIDS before dying at about age 12, and not one of us can do more than what he said here: ""Do all you can, with what you have, in the time you have, in the place where you are.""Also watch how the mind routinely gets caught up in becoming: in making plans that draw us into desires that draw us into rushing. The trick is to see this happening before it captures you.Most deeply, try to rest in and enjoy the richness of this moment. Even an ordinary moment -- with its sounds, sights, tastes, smells, sensations, feelings, and thoughts -- is amazingly interesting and rewarding. Afloat in the present, there's no need to rush along to anything else.Even when you don't have a cat in your lap.Rick Hanson, Ph.D., is a neuropsychologist and author of Hardwiring Happiness (coming in October 2013), Buddha's Brain: The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love, and Wisdom (in 24 languages) and Just One Thing: Developing a Buddha Brain One Simple Practice at a Time (in 12 languages).

1,BUSINESS,Ikea's New Free Food Deal -- and the Powerful Psychology Behind It,"Troy Campbell, Contributor
Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ikeas-new-free-food-deal_us_5bb2f692e4b0480ca65faa1d,In the end what's so fascinating is that customers may be completely aware of how Ikea's deal will manipulate them. But they may be fine with it anyway.,2013-06-02,"A picture taken on March 27, 2013 shows the sign of Swedish furniture giant Ikea at the Odysseum shopping mall, in Montpellier, southern France. AFP PHOTO / PASCAL GUYOT (Photo credit should read PASCAL GUYOT/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2f6922000009900001567.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," This summer, Ikea lets customers eat completely free on certain days. Here's exactly what the deal looks like for the Charlotte Ikea (deals vary slightly by location). Charlotte, NC Eat for FREE -- EVERY Thursday and Saturday in June.  Eat for Free in our restaurant by spending $150 in the store and then deducting the cost of your meal from your store receipt upon checking out. That means customers can get the meatballs, the smoked salmon, the lingonberries, the chicken fingers, and the hazelnut chocolate -- and as long as they eat it on the premises, it's all free. Ikea seems to understand consumer psychology as this deal hits all the psychological buttons people like me go to graduate school to study about. Here's a rundown.It's Free  Free is not just any low price, it's a special price. People value it more than they rationally should. Ikea often offers $0.99 mini-breakfasts, but research in consumer psychology shows people put a premium on free. Free has its own value and a warm glow around it. Behavioral Economist Dan Ariely explains the ""special price of zero"" in his best-selling book Predictably Irrational.It's Freedom Ikea not only makes the item free, it gives the customer freedom to get as much food as they want. My Ikea cashier even encouraged me to buy more. Ikea is offering freedom in a genuine way here. That sets Ikea apart. Also, it makes customers responsible for how much they save. Instead of considering whether Ikea is offering a good enough deal, customers may ask themselves, ""Am I taking enough advantage of this offer?"" Customers may even be proud of how much they saved by stuffing their faces. It's Food Ikea wants you to start your trip eating. You need the calories and caffeine to make it all the way through the showroom and marketplace. Customers can become tired out by making constant decisions and potentially just give up or become too frustrated to shop. Glucose consumption can prevent this depletion and keep customers shopping. Food and chatting over food also makes people happy. Harvard researchers contacted people on their smart phones at random times during the day. They measured people's momentary happiness and found that people tended to be the happiest when they had just eaten, socialized or had sex. The fact that people are not only eating but feasting on free food may intensify this happiness. Importantly for Ikea's profits, when people are happy they tend to be less vigilant in their thoughts, which may lead them to buy more.It's Ikea Additionally, Ikea is not just any store, it's a special store. People love it, maybe more than they rationally should. Ikea's trustworthy image allows it to offer deals without seeming manipulative. If another company, e.g. a BP gas station, offered a similar deal, it might make customers stop and worry that they were being tricked. Certain brands activate what is known as 'persuasion knowledge'. This leads customers to be vigilant for persuasion tactics. Ikea tends not to activate 'persuasion knowledge.' It's Going to Make You Spend Money The $150 price point may lead people to turn their trip into a big furniture trip or at least encourage them to be looser with their money. People may start their shopping trip with a goal to spend money, not necessarily to get specific products. As the shopping continues, a $150 target may become $400 as the positive vibes of a gluttonous free feast carry over into a willingness to spend money. Final Thoughts In the end what's so fascinating is that customers may be completely aware of how Ikea's deal will manipulate them. But they may be fine with it anyway.Ikea has taken shopping from something that usually causes a pain of paying and turned it into an event with a feast. Ikea profits because it makes us smile even when that credit card slides. One way to view this is that Ikea is an evil corporation trying to trick us. Another way to view this is that Ikea has made the chore of shopping fun. Luckily for Ikea, their customers prefer this latter view."

Apple Inc. and two publishers, Macmillan and Penguin, were accused by the U.S. Justice Department of conspiring to fix prices of digital books to undermine Amazon.com Inc.'s dominance of the industry. Photographer: Scott Eells/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb36633210000e700c7ca7e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Nate RaymondNEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc goes to trial Monday over allegations by federal and state authorities that it conspired with publishers to raise the price of e-books.The trial pits the maker of the popular iPad and iPhone against the U.S. Justice Department in a case that tests how Internet retailers interact with content providers.""This case will effectively set the rules for Internet commerce,"" said David Balto, a former policy director for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.The Justice Department filed its case against Apple and five of the six largest U.S. book publishers in April 2012. The lawsuit accused them of conspiring to increase e-book prices and break Amazon.com Inc's hold on pricing.Apple is going to trial alone after the five publishers agreed to eliminate prohibitions on wholesale discounts and to pay a collective $164 million to benefit consumers.The five publishers were Pearson Plc's Penguin Group, News Corp's HarperCollins Publishers Inc, CBS Corp's Simon & Schuster Inc, Hachette Book Group Inc and MacMillan.The U.S. government is not seeking damages but instead an order blocking Apple from engaging in similar conduct. However, if Apple is found liable, it could still face damages in a separate trial by the state attorneys general and consumers pursuing class actions.'DIRECT EVIDENCE'Based on a comment by the presiding judge at the final hearing before the trial, Apple may face an uphill battle.""I believe that the government will be able to show at trial direct evidence that Apple knowingly participated in and facilitated a conspiracy to raise prices of e-books,"" U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is hearing the case without a jury, said on May 23.While those comments suggested Apple might be smart to seek a settlement, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview Tuesday with All Things Digital that Apple was ""not going to sign something that says we did something we didn't do.""Apple may be calculating that future damages claims by states and class actions make it worth going to trial, said John Lopatka, a law professor at Pennsylvania State University.""Apple might think, 'We may lose at the trial level, but we may well convince an appellate court the trial judge mischaracterized the evidence,"" Lopatka said.'MARKET IN TURMOIL'Neither side disputes that in 2009 publishers were concerned about low prices for e-books resulting from the dominance of Amazon.com, which launched its Kindle e-reader in 2007.As it prepared to launch its iPad and was looking into opening an electronic bookstore, Apple has said it was entering a ""market in turmoil,"" with growing tension between the publishers and Amazon.Amazon, which declined comment, was selling 90 percent of all e-books in 2009. It was buying books wholesale and at times selling them at a loss, pricing them at $9.99, with the goal of promoting its Kindle.The Justice Department contends that Apple's entry into the market provided publishers with a means to get together to increase prices.At the suggestion of Hachette and HarperCollins, the government says Apple began considering an agency model in which publishers set the price and Apple took a fixed percentage.Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011, told his biographer that, ""we told the publishers, ‘We'll go to the agency model, where you set the price, and we get our 30 percent, and yes, the customer pays a little more, but that's what you want anyway.'""The Justice Department said Apple provided assurances to publishers their rivals would join.Apple says that it was unaware of efforts by the publishers to conspire before it entered the marketplace, and said when it did, it act independently.It also contends that in the wake of its introduction of the iBookstore, prices have fallen rather than risen from $7.97 on average to $7.34.BIGGER ISSUEFor the Justice Department, many of its goals have been accomplished, thanks to the settlements with publishers, which lifted restrictions on discounting and promotions by e-book retailers. Those deals have already lowered prices for consumers, the department says.But the government may be aiming at a bigger issue, said Geoffrey Manne, a law professor at Lewis & Clark Law School.Among other things, the government lawsuit seeks to declare that certain provisions in the agreements between Apple and the publishers are unenforceable.These provisions, known as most-favored-nation clauses, provided that if other e-bookstores sold the books at cheaper prices, then Apple could reduce its prices. The government has said this provided an incentive for the publishers to raise prices at other retailers.Similar types of most-favored nation clauses have been central in other content industries such as music and television where content providers have a role in setting the price. They have also become a discussion point in certain antitrust communities, Manne said, and a government win could ""send a pretty strong message"" about their use.""If the government wins this case, it would be because the court for some reason determines that most-favored-nation clauses are more harmful to competition than helpful,"" he said.The case is United States v. Apple Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-02826.(Reporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Eddie Evans and Kenneth Barry)"

And when you become conscious of this fact and perform actions that encourage wellness, you can live the long, joyful, and extraordinary life you deserve.",2013-06-01,Close-up of the face of a female African Elephant (Loxodonta africana),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d32da3c00004c000a0d4c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We hear it all the time: ""Health is everything."" And while there are many actions we can take to promote great health, we tend to overlook some of the simplest and most obvious. Wholesome foods and regular exercise are, of course, crucial factors, but I stress the importance of several longstanding, often-forgotten solutions that have improved the quality and duration of human life since the dawn of humankind. Implement my five keys to health and longevity into your day-to-day life and reap the benefits of a more sound state of being:Live with a purpose: The first (and possibly most important) key is rooted within your unique life purpose. Few of us actually live with a purpose. And those of us who do have trained our minds and bodies to want to live longer because we require time to fulfill our mission. Louise Hay founded Hay House, the publishing house that published my sixth book, Wholeliness, at 58 years old. And now, 28 years later, both she and her company are thriving! I offer you this example as a reminder that you can embark on your soul's journey at any age. But you must first determine what you were put on this earth to do. Remind yourself each day that you aren't anywhere near finished with your special mission.Know your genetic code: Both your history and future lie within your genes. Understanding your genetics can be critical in preventing disease, as anticipating certain illnesses that run in your family can literally save your life. Know your family history, and be aware of the genetic factors that have repeated in your lineage. For example, if cancer is prevalent in your family, get routine or extra screenings to check for any early, unwanted changes. Angelina Jolie made the brave choice to undergo a double mastectomy so as not to repeat a disease that caused her mother's death. Once you comprehend the genetic issues to which your family is predisposed, you can act to stop these illnesses from manifesting in your own life.Perform sacred rituals: For those of us who can spare a minute out of the day, my advice is to spend it in a sacred way. We're such busy creatures that we rarely take a timeout. We put so much effort into taking care of everyone around us that we forget to take care of ourselves. But self-love is the key to all success. No matter how hectic your schedule, take 30 minutes out your day, each day, to enjoy ""me"" time. Breathe deeply, meditate, relax in a quiet place, walk in the outdoors, or practice your favorite hobby. Expand your talents and explore new areas of your complex self. Consider this personal time a cleansing of the soul, a purging of negativity, and a detox of your mind. A healthy, reliable relationship with yourself may help prolong your life. Bask in the company of others: The fourth key encourages you to be a social butterfly. Being around other people can enhance your mood and increase your lifespan. This is because being in good company rewires your neurons and can downright change your brain chemistry. ""Feel-good"" neurons interact and multiply, and you begin to reflect a more positive attitude with time. Things that used to bother you may affect you less and less. Laughter is essential, but it must be shared with those you love. Get together with people who make you feel good -- we can learn so much from each other through simple, honest, reflective conversation. Plato believed that ultimate truth can be reached through dialogue, and you'll be surprised at the truths you can discover and the wise conclusions you can draw just by listening to the unbelievable experiences of others.Everything in moderation: Nothing holds more truth than this ancient phrase which reminds us to calm exaggerative tendencies. When we resolve to cultivate good health, we commit to total awareness of our actions and promise to engage in activities that advance our well-being. This is not to say we can't succumb to periodic weaknesses, from sweets to alcohol to meat to coffee. The key is not to consume a few foods in excess, but to integrate a large variety of foods in moderation. Keep yourself on the moderate track by allowing yourself two cheat days a week. Promise to be good from Monday through Friday, for example, then indulge in your favorite palatable pleasures sans guilt on the weekend.Contrary to popular belief, your health is in your hands. And when you become conscious of this fact and perform actions that encourage wellness, you can live the long, joyful, and extraordinary life you deserve.To Life, Dr. Carmen HarraTo sign up for Dr. Harra's weekly transformative tips, click here.For more by Dr. Carmen Harra, click here.For more on wellness, click here."

Until we don't. When my adoptive mother Elaine Kain died, I lost not only my one-and-only mom, but my best friend, movie date and companion extraordinaire. I was left without my former identity as an adult child, a daughter, a caregiver. To be alive means losing things, people, and animals we love, but this loss? It was devastation. I'd lost my reason for being. My first thought was, ""Who will take care of me?"" One type of creativity literally saved my life: writing letters.I began writing Mom letters, exploring the dark caverns of my pain as I penned poems I never dreamed existed inside me. I demanded visitations, answers and comfort from my deceased mother. I lived for the time I got to spend with ""her"" with pen and paper or computer screen. But after months of exploring my pain, I turned a corner. In the midst of acute grief, I got  bored with just telling Mom how bad it was without her. A new desire sprung up, a wee flower bursting through the tiniest crack in the concrete -- what if my mother could write back to me?This dialogue became my book, Letters to My Mama: An Adopted Daughter's Creative Journey Through the First Year of Grief. This hearing back from her changed everything. How many of us have wondered if we did enough, said too much or never got the chance to say anything to our departed ones? I was allowed to say the words I'd always wanted to and best of all, I got answers.While they weren't always pretty, they rang with the truth of mom's love. She still told me to go to bed earlier and not to wear leggings. (""They're not right for your body type, dear,"" she whispered.) But most of all, the letters reminded me that no matter where she is, she will always be my mother. After a year of letter writing, Mom's hope had integrated into my psyche and I became able to feel the love in the letters become my strength. This type of ""echo writing,"" as I call it, works for all kinds of losses. Whether you are grieving a person, beloved pet, health, job or even a cherished dream, writing to whom or what you have let go of, and hearing back from ""them"" hits a sweet spot in the heart.

Well, if you asked Marc Jacobs, he might disagree.Robert Duffy, president and vice chairman of the Wintour twin/New York City fashion legend's empire, Marc Jacobs International, revealed to Women's Wear Daily that Jacobs has given up his Creative Director title at Marc by Marc Jacobs. The brand, once defined by a unique, youthful irreverence, is now 13 years old and, Duffy confessed, ""getting a little stale."" Jacobs hopes to give his line a much-needed update in a market far more saturated than the one in which it began.The company has enlisted Katie Hillier and Luella Bartley to revive Jacobs' legacy. ""The competition has become too great... we rested on our laurels and it hurt us,"" Duffy told WWD. Hillier, who will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of Marc by Marc's design and production, enlisted Bartley to assist her because the British designer is familiar with updating older collections -- she injected Mulberry with new ideas back in 2002. In addition, Bartley ran her own eponymous ready-to-wear label for a decade.“He’s still the boss,” Duffy said of Marc by Marc Jacobs' legendary founder. “He’s as involved as he wants to be. It depends on the season.” Jacobs continues to serve as creative director for Louis Vuitton.Duffy expects to see changes in Marc by Marc's profits by fall 2014.

""They've been to the farm. They know it. Is it somebody on our farm? Someone in our own network of people we know, or some random individual? We don't know who's up to it, and it's spooky,"" Roloff said.An escalation of the threats against the Roloffs, a family of six with three members with dwarfism, put local law enforcement on notice.""The threats have got more hateful and more graphic in nature. They do seem to be escalating and becoming more disturbing,"" Sergeant Bob Ray of the Washington County Sheriff's Office told The Huffington Post earlier this week.The harassment -- including rape, death, and bomb threats -- has been directed at Roloff, his wife, Amy, and the couple's children. The intimidation has been persistent over recent months, but came to a head recently when Matt Roloff started receiving abusive phone calls and spotted suspicious cars in his driveway.""All that combined has made us a little bit uneasy,"" Roloff said. ""And the stuff these people are saying is pretty nasty. They violate every hate category that you can think of. You just can't just go around saying you're going to rape people or blow them up because of their disability.""While the percentage of violent incidents in stalking cases is low, such fears are justified, according to Sal Lifrieri, President of Protective Countermeasures & Consulting, Inc., a firm that provides consulting on threats and vulnerability.""There is a sliding scale. In less than 2 percent of the cases you have actual violence, Lifrieri told HuffPost. However, he said, the problem is that when there is violence, it is typically severe or extreme -- leading to injury or even death.Attempts by the perpetrator to make some kind of physical contact with the victim are more common, occurring in ""probably 40 to 50 percent of the cases,"" Lifrieri said.The sheriff's office said it is actively investigating and has identified some persons of interest. They also suspect that one person is using a variety of email and Facebook accounts to send the online messages.""Quite a few of them are very similar. [It looks like] someone is cutting and pasting a lot of the stuff because, quite frankly, the grammar is rather atrocious,"" Ray previously told HuffPost.A former FBI agent who's worked similar cases, however, criticized how the police have investigated the case, saying they already should have traced the origins of the phone calls and online messages.The investigating agency is probably not sophisticated enough and may not have experience in these situations,"" Harold Copus, now head of Atlanta-based Copus Security Consultants to HuffPost. ""It's not like CSI and those other shows you see on TV where a caller has to be on the line for a specific period of time. Nowadays they can get that information almost instantly.”He also fears that department isn't as familiar with handling celebrity stalkers as law enforcement protecting Hollywood personalities in Los Angeles.Cases of harassment and stalking can continue for years, and there is a concern that some of the most recent threats are connected to earlier incidents against the Roloffs. In October 2009, someone vandalized a sign on the Roloff property. The family heard gunshots and found that a sign advertising their farm had been riddled with what looked like bullet holes. The incident was just one of a series of property crimes against the family, they say. Lifrieri said the Roloffs' decision to speak out might bring about a quicker resolution.""One of the better advantages in the celebrity world is that because these cases develop a media response, they generate a better response from law enforcement. For the average citizen, it can be a very frustrating experience dealing with authorities,"" he said.Roloff said he wants to make one thing very clear: The good things his family has experienced as a result of their reality show far outweigh the bad.""We get far more love and support and blessings from people, so we hate to put too much attention on one needle in the haystack that's sticking [out],"" he said.After a moment of thought, Roloff added, ""But when you start threatening people's lives, it crosses a line.""Anyone with information in the case is asked to contact the Washington County Sheriff's Office at 503-629-0111."

Media outlets and public forums alike are buzzing with discussion about Pew's latest findings, and the topic of interest is one for the books: 40% of all households with children under the age of 18 include mothers who are the sole or primary income provider for the family. Even bigger news, 63% of these breadwinner moms are single mothers. At Dress for Success, nearly 80 percent of our clients are single mothers. Providing our women with the professional attire, network of support and career development tools they need to achieve their professional best, I've come to know and love the inspiring advancements of the single working mom firsthand. But our work is far from done, and the single mother's adversity is far from over. According to Pew, there's still a significant gap between the family income of married and single moms, with the married mother's family bringing in a median of $80,000, nearly four times that of the $23,000 for families led by the single mother. So, if the vast majority of breadwinner moms are, in fact, single mothers who are barely making enough to provide for their families and stay above the poverty line, why isn't that making headlines? It is time to start discussing the discrepancy in income between the married and single mother--and building a support system to close the gap. Before the single mom can climb her way up the professional ladder, she must first find employment. Compared to their married counterparts, many more single mothers are struggling to even find work. Just last year, the single mom faced a startling 14.1% unemployment rate. Meanwhile, public opinion polls from Pew's latest report show that 64% of Americans still believe the growing number of single mothers in the U.S. is a big problem. It seems the bigger problem, however, is the lack of support for these hardworking women. Vacation days, affordable day care services and flexible work hours are all limited for the newly hired professional, but all of these ""benefits"" are more than just a perk for the working mom--they are imperative--but how does the single working mother elevate herself to the wage-garnering level of her married counterparts?To assist women in adapting to--and succeeding in-- a professional setting, Dress for Success created the Professional Woman's Group (PWG). For the newly working woman, this program gets to the bottom of such challenges that our mostly single mother demographic faces, creating a safe and supportive space for these women to discuss how they can propel themselves passed any professional problems that they may be encountering and achieve the same economic independence as those women who also have familial financial support to supplement their own income.Adjusting to office culture, finding a work-life balance, and breaking through the glass ceiling is difficult for any woman who has struggled to maintain professional stability throughout her life, but it is especially complicated for the single working mother. Every single mom must be a breadwinner mom for the sake of herself and her children, as well as even for her greater community. For the mother without a partner to provide additional income to the household, working is not about living comfortably, but rather living adequately. At Dress for Success, we work everyday to shift these statistics and make a positive impact on the lives of women throughout the world, but to truly raise the median income for working single mothers--for a true change to come--it takes work from everyone else, too. (Yes, even you!) What have you learned throughout your career? What obstacles have you faced and how did you overcome them? What knowledge or skills do you possess that could be taught to someone else? Reach out to a single mother in your neighborhood. Talk to her. Teach her. Become a mentor to her. By providing just a piece of yourself to one of these single mothers, you are helping to shape a whole new future--one where all women are the breadwinners, bringing home the same sized loaves."

Closed storefronts have been painted to resemble working stores, complete with doors that appear open but don't function and two-dimensional goods hanging from the windows, all in an effort to hide the dereliction caused by the economic struggles of the past few years, according to the Irish Times.“We want to present the county as best as we can and promote it in terms of industry and tourism,” local Council Chief Executive Brendan Hegarty told The Irish Times, calling the project a “phenomenal opportunity.”But some locals view the superficial efforts as a wasteful attempt to hide real economic struggles. This particular area in Northern Ireland suffers higher child poverty rates than the rest of the country, ThinkProgress reports. Meanwhile, lost jobs and failed businesses in the fallout from the global financial crisis are recovering at a glacial pace -- economic growth in Northern Ireland is expected to remain under 0.5 percent through 2014, Belfast Telegraph reports. “No one is fooled,” Phil Flanagan, a former owner of a closed butcher shop which has now been papered over to appear as if it’s still thriving, told The Telegrpah. “It is like when your mother-in-law is coming to visit and you give the house a tidy up.”Indeed, such attempts to hide harsh economic realities aren’t new. In 2010, the U.K. town of North Tyneside painted nearly an entire street with decoy storefronts to hide the effects of recession, the BBC reports. But not everyone in County Fermanagh views the fake shops negatively. The project has provided a much needed stimulus in the form of jobs for painters and construction workers, according to the BBC.""The town looks fantastic, it's a good excuse for people to get doing work,” one painter said."
