1,BUSINESS,Expected Decline In Mortgage Lending To Hurt Big Banks' Profits,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mortgage-lending-big-bank-profits_us_5bb2f977e4b0480ca6600b4f,July 12 (Reuters) - Unexpectedly large quarterly profits at JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co hide a more worrisome,2013-07-13,"In this May 6, 2012, photo, a Wells Fargo sign is displayed at a branch in New York. Wells Fargo is reporting higher earnings for the second quarter thanks to a pickup in lending and a decline in the amount of bad loans, according to reports Friday, July 13, 2012. (AP Photo/CX Matiash)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2f9772500003200389843.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Peter RudegeairJuly 12 (Reuters) - Unexpectedly large quarterly profits at JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co hide a more worrisome forecast for the rest of the year for many U.S. banks. Things could get worse before they get any better.Wells Fargo's profit was buoyed in the second quarter by consumers rushing to refinance their mortgages and buy new homes, driven by record low interest rates and a recovering housing market. JPMorgan's mortgage lending helped the bank for much of 2012, and second-quarter results this year were by some measures strong too - it made more loans, even if its pretax profits from lending fell 37 percent.But mortgage lending is likely to be less of a support for banks going forward, as the U.S. Federal Reserve has started talking about tapering off its massive bond-buying program and borrowing rates for home loans have jumped. Thirty-year mortgage rates rose to 4.58 percent at the end of the second quarter, up 0.82 percentage point from the first quarter.Executives from both banks, which between them make one in three U.S. home loans, said on Friday that mortgage lending volumes would decline in the coming months and so profits from the business would fall. JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said rising mortgage rates could slash volume by 30 percent to 40 percent. That would result in a ""dramatic reduction in profits"" in the business, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said.At the same time economic growth has not ramped up enough for the rest of these banks' businesses - such as small business loans and credit cards - to make up for the loss of that income. There may be a lull between the drop-off in mortgage lending and the boost to other forms of revenue from an improving economy and higher long-term interest rates.""If the economy is getting stronger, it's not manifesting itself in terms of balance sheet growth of the banks,"" said Christopher Mutascio, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ""Mortgage headwinds are a bit more instantaneous, and the pick-up in the other business lines may take some time.""A more complete outlook for the banking industry will emerge next week when both Citigroup Inc and Bank of America report their earnings. ""NO GROWTH"" IN THE MORTGAGE BUSINESSThe looming problem is not lost on the banks and could lead to further cost cutting as they try to bridge the gap.JPMorgan's Lake said depending on market conditions the bank could accelerate its previously announced cost-cutting targets. In February, the largest U.S. bank had said it planned to cut 17,000 jobs by the end of 2014, or roughly 6.6 percent of its workforce. The job cuts were largely targeted at areas such as mortgage banking and retail banking.To some extent, banks' mortgage businesses have built-in hedges in the form of income from collecting payments on home loans. As rates increase and fewer homeowners refinance their mortgages, banks earn more from collecting payments on existing loans.But mortgage lending revenues dwarfs servicing revenues at present at many banks. At Wells Fargo, for instance, servicing accounted for just 4 percent of fee income in the second quarter, compared to 22 percent for mortgage lending.Though servicing income does provide a bit of a natural balance, it should not be viewed ""to dollar-for-dollar offset any reduction in revenues from the origination side of the business,"" Wells Fargo's Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said.Wells Fargo also signaled that its streak of seven consecutive quarters of making more than $100 billion of home loans is likely coming to an end soon.""We just don't think that we are going to see $100 billion of mortgage volume, given the current rates today, in the third quarter,"" Sloan said. ""We will need to go ahead and make some adjustments.""Across the U.S. market, refinancing activity fell 44 percent in the second quarter, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. At Wells Fargo, refinancing made up 56 percent of all mortgage loans in the second quarter and over 60 percent of mortgage loans for the preceding four quarters. At JPMorgan, refinancing made up around three-fourths of all home loans in the past year.""There's no growth in their mortgage business, and their mortgage application pipeline is down,"" said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, which has $650 million in assets under management. OTHER LOANS COULD PICK UP THE SLACK, OVER TIMETo be sure, continued economic recovery will contribute to earnings in more immediate ways as well: It will allow banks to set aside less money to cover loan losses, and dip into existing reserves. In the second quarter, JPMorgan released $1.5 billion from its loan loss reserves. Wells Fargo released $500 million and said it expected more in the coming quarters if the economy continues to grow.For its part, Wells Fargo is confident that its diversified business model will allow it to prosper over time, if not every single quarter.""The mortgage horse has been a big, strong horse. We've got 89 other horses that are going to be able to grow,"" Sloan said, referring to Wells Fargo's stagecoach logo.But growth in other businesses such as commercial and consumer loans that are expected to eventually make up for lost mortgage revenues are yet to materialize.Total loans at JPMorgan fell by $3 billion to $725 billion in the second quarter, while total loans at Wells Fargo rose only $2 billion to $802 billion - both compared with the first quarter.Consumer loans were up only $250 million in the second quarter at Wells Fargo, and the bank's commercial clients did not exhibit any increased demand for credit.""I wish they were, but unfortunately not. When you look at (credit) line usage in the commercial side, it has been pretty stagnant for a bit,"" Sloan said. ""There's no question there's going to be a bit of a lag effect as it relates to stronger commercial loan growth.""

Numerous guests have also claimed they were groped by Disney employees playing characters such as Donald Duck and Tigger, Slate reports. Meanwhile, Publix estimates that if the Florida law passed, it could shave $1 million from the $37 million it paid last year on settlements and legal costs related to personal injury lawsuits, according to The Tampa Bay Business Journal. Publix and Disney declined to answer specific questions about the proposal from the Orlando Sentinel, except to say they backed the legislation.

Some odd new details have emerged regarding its progress -- or lack thereof.It turns out the script Russell Crowe commissioned rocker Nick Cave to write in 2009 -- which was completed and subsequently rejected by the studios -- took some wild turns, as Cave revealed during a recent episode of the podcast ""WTF With Marc Maron."" Cave said Crowe ""eventually rang me up and asked if I wanted to write 'Gladiator 2,' and for someone who had only written one film script ['Ghosts... of the Civil Dead'], it was quite an ask."" While his lack of experience may have served as the initial hurdle, Cave found a bigger one: ""Hey, Russell, didn't you die in 'Gladiator 1'?"" he asked. To which Crowe replied, ""Yeah, you sort that out.""What followed was something called ""Christ Killer,"" a resuscitation of the first ""Gladiator"" that attempted to make Maximus immortal and include a Jesus character. In Cave's proposed sequel, Crowe's character ""goes down to purgatory and is sent down by the gods, who are dying in heaven because there's this one god, there's this Christ character, down on Earth who is gaining popularity and so the many gods are dying so they send Gladiator back to kill Christ and his followers.""The plot gets more complicated, but what's more interesting is the conflicting reactions to the script that have been reported. Cave said on ""WTF"" that Crowe nixed the effort immediately with a simple, ""Don't like it, mate."" But in 2009, The Guardian reported that Crowe and director Ridley Scott were attempting to work with Cave's product, with Scott reportedly saying the ""storytelling works brilliantly."" Still, Cave, who went on to pen the 2012 Shia LaBeouf vehicle ""Lawless,"" told Maron he knew the script wouldn't be made, despite it being a ""stone-cold masterpiece.""

4,ENTERTAINMENT,"On His Birthday, Giving Thanks for Hanks","John Farr, Contributor
Editor, bestmoviesbyfarr.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/on-his-birthday-giving-th_us_5bb430b8e4b066f8d255f2d0,"When his many legions of fans consider his success, I'm certain there's a consistent thought running through their heads: it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. Happy Birthday, Tom. Now, here's my personal Hanks list.",2013-07-13,"NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 09: Tom Hanks attends the 67th Annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall on June 9, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by D Dipasupil/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb430b8200000e8000060cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With nary a ripple, Tom Hanks turned 57 this past week. And though he hasn't made a truly great film other than Toy Story 3 in quite a few years (we can debate Cloud Atlas), he is still eminently bankable and his star shines bright. Did I say bankable? Let me amend that. He is in fact ranked the top star in terms of all-time box office revenue. Few early on would have predicted he'd attain this heady distinction, Hanks least of all.He has been described as today's Jimmy Stewart. I think that's apt. He shares Stewart's everyman folksiness and approachability, a quality that's harder to project effectively than one might think. You can't deny there's something powerfully familiar -- and reassuring-about both actors on-screen. They are us.Reportedly, both Stewart and Hanks were painfully shy and awkward as children, but unlike his predecessor, Tom did not get the chance to go to Princeton and contemplate a career in architecture. His was a decidedly middle-class, somewhat confused upbringing, with his parents, a cook and hospital worker, divorcing early and dividing up their children between them.Tom studied theatre in college, but never went on to study formally at say, the Actor's Studio. Instead he participated in community theatre, developing his skills through watching and doing and in the process, learning all the rope of stage production.Landing in New York City, he distinguished himself in some Off-Broadway work before breaking through in a short-lived 1980 TV series called Bosom Buddies, playing a young man forced to cross-dress to live in an affordable all-female hotel. I still remember my first sight of Tom Hanks on that show, in a dress, wig and make-up. Though Buddies was admired by some critics, I turned the channel...and the show itself lasted two seasons.Then a 1982 guest spot on Happy Days brought him to the attention of Ron Howard, who was casting his third film, Splash (1984), about a young man who falls for a mermaid. The film was a hit, and so was Tom.But could he do serious parts? The '90s gave us the answer. In 1995, Hanks became the first (and only) actor since Spencer Tracy to win two consecutive Best Actor Oscars -- both for non-comedic roles.(A quick note here on 1994's Forrest Gump, Hanks's second Oscar, and for many his signature role. Many will be outraged to find this title not on my favorites list below. This movie seems to polarize people -- either you adore it, or you don't. I thought it was pure whimsy -- sometimes charming, other times forced. That said, no one else could have played the character so well).When his many legions of fans consider his success, I'm certain there's a consistent thought running through their heads: it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.Happy Birthday, Tom.Now, here's my personal Hanks list:Big (1988)- Tom plays a boy trapped in a young man's body who makes good in a grown-up world. Hanks is wonderful in this enduring charmer from Penny Marshall, co-starring Elizabeth Perkins and Rober Loggia. Indelible image: Tom spits out the caviar.A League Of Their Own (1992)- Tom and Penny Marshall reunite in this colorful tale of an all-women baseball league that earned particular prominence during World War 2. Tom is the drunken manager of one team, and he brings both humor and pathos to what was an unusual role for him. Also look for Madonna as a member of the team. Batter up!Philadelphia (1993)- Tom cemented his ability to do drama as well as comedy, playing a gay man dying of AIDS who gets fired because of his disease and decides to sue. An astonishing and highly demanding performance, this won Tom his first Oscar. Directed by Jonathan Demme, the film co-stars Denzel Washington as the lawyer who pleads his case.Apollo 13 (1995)- Hanks's assured portrayal of astronaut Jim Lovell anchors Ron Howard's rousing tribute to the Apollo space program and the courageous and resourceful efforts -- both on-board and on the ground -- to get the Apollo 13 crew back safely from the moon after an equipment malfunction.Toy Story 1, 2, 3 (1995, 1999, 2010)- This smart, colorful and imaginative Pixar series detailing the adventures of a group of talking toys who worry their owner will grow up and discard them remains hugely popular for a good reason: it transports us all back to our own childhood, when we all had toys we cared about. It's hard to imagine these ageless features would be anywhere near as good without the voice of Hanks as cowboy doll protagonist Woody.Saving Private Ryan (1998)- Steven Spielberg's triumphant World War 2 film -- by turns touching and intense -- features Hanks as an officer assigned to find and return home an enlisted man on the front lines whose brothers have all been killed in combat. His Captain Miller is no John Wayne character: he does his duty, all the while suppressing the persistent tremor in his hands. A stunning achievement.Return With Honor (1998)- Hanks narrates this fascinating and insightful doc about the harrowing experience of U.S prisoners of war who endured years of torture and confinement in North Vietnam prisons. A real eye-opener, and watch for former POW Senator John McCain.Looking for good movies to watch? Top movie recommendations?

Even on your worst days, you can refocus with just a little intention.",2013-07-12,Businessman suffering from headache and looking at a laptop,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d564724000051009509ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been one of those days. You can't believe the number of emails, your calendar doesn't even have space to get a cup of coffee, and your phone keeps buzzing. It is so easy for every single one of us to get sucked into the reactive cycle of problem solving and producing. Worse, we think it's normal. We think that our job as human beings is to earn, perform, and win. Okay, earning is good, it's usually a better day when we're at our best, and winning is more fun than losing (usually).The problem is, our offices are almost exclusively dominated by a culture of doing. What matters to most managers most days is metrics and profit. That's not wrong either, but it's not enough. Before applying the calculus of efficiency and worker productivity, we need to think about the way we work. Our ability to pay attention to what's happening right now defines the quality of our efforts and whether we enjoy the volume we need to produce. Our well-being is at its highest level at work, whether we love what we do or we do what we have to do to survive, when each moment is treated as more than just results.Your brain has an alarm, the amygdala, that wants you safe and to pay attention. It also has frontal lobes that help you feel focused and in control. It's really easy for your alarm to run your life and treat work as a life or death struggle. If you're not in the military, public safety, or espionage, work needs to be bigger than survival. And it doesn't take much to get your frontal lobes in control of your body and moment to moment experience. Here are a few exercises to test whether you're present at work.Stand on one leg. During a conference call, there is nothing like a little stork kung fu to tighten your core and get your brain refocused. No time between meetings and already too caffeinated to use a coffee break to reset your thinking? Stand on one leg for 30 seconds at a time then switch to the other leg. Your alarm will realize you're choosing to slow down and focus and it will turn down the reactive flow of adrenaline that makes us stressed.Take back your calendar. If there is not reflection time is your daily schedule; if you can't make time to exercise; if you know how you're going to get your work done in the time available each day; you have to reset your calendar. You have to start each day fitting in the time you need to be well. It may be little breaks or mental health days. It may be balancing difficult with pleasurable conversations and meetings. Regardless, you own your calendar. Your alarm will turn down the moment it sees you chosing the pace of your days.Dial a friend. You're not calling to vent. You're not calling to make plans. If they're having a bad day, it is not your job to solve their problems. You're just calling to listen. The moment we listen to the people we care about, with no other purpose than to appreciate that we love them and that they are in our lives, the world's problems dissolve. Imagine if we treated every relationship with such reverence. Your alarm can't fire when you're savoring a few moments with the people you care about.The reason we react is that our alarm thinks there is a problem for us to solve or danger to escape. Don't let your brain make work feel like everything's dramatic and falling apart. Even on your worst days, you can refocus with just a little intention.For more by Jon Wortmann, click here.For more on stress, click here."
