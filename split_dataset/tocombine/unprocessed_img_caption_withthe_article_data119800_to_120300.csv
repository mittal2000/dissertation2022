0,WOMEN,Elliot Rodger And The C-Word,"Ann Brenoff, ContributorSenior Writer/Columnist, The Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elliot-rodger-and-the-c-word_b_5400621.html,"It was one of those icky moments that, if you are a woman, you have likely experienced. It may have been years ago, but it might as well have been yesterday because you still remember it in vivid detail -- including how vulnerable you felt, how powerless you must have seemed.",2014-05-28,"This undated photo from the California Department of Motor Vehicles shows the driver license photo of Elliott Rodger. Rodger, 22, went on a murderous rampage Friday, May 23, 2014, killing six before dying in a shootout with deputies, in the community of Isla Vista near the University of California, Santa Barbara, in Goleta, Calif., (AP Photo/California DMV)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fa3d24000031009816b3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Less than 24 hours after Elliot Rodger made sure that all those women who so ""unjustly"" kept him a virgin got what they ""deserved,"" a 25-year-old colleague of mine had something small and inconsequential happen to her that was actually neither small nor inconsequential.She was leaving a party at a Hollywood bar on Saturday evening, hurrying toward the exit to meet her boyfriend. As she rushed past the bar, a group of men tried to engage her in conversation; they came on to her, plain and simple. In a genuine rush -- and not the least bit interested -- she sidestepped them and kept on walking. But one of the men, angered by her apparent rejection, unleashed his rage on her. He let it rip, screaming out that she was a ""C*NT!"" in a voice so loud that it electrified the room. It startled her, jolted her to her core. My friend was caught in that split-second moment of disbelief, caught between the crosshairs of anger and fear. She actually slowed her pace and looked over her shoulder to do a reality check. Had this stranger in a bar really just called her that word because she wasn't flattered by his unwanted attention? Yes, yes he had. And realizing that he had, she did what any sane woman would do: She picked up her pace, running the last few feet to her car with her keys poised to unlock the door as quickly as possible. It was one of those icky moments that, if you are a woman, you have likely experienced. It may have been years ago, but it might as well have been yesterday because you still remember it in vivid detail -- including how vulnerable you felt, how powerless you must have seemed. It's one of those moments that stays with you, long after the c*nt-caller has jerked off to the memory of your stunned look and forgotten you. It festers like a sore in your gut. You replay the scene in your mind and you think about how you wished you had kicked him in the balls or thrown a bar glass at his sneering face. Three days later, back in the office after the long holiday weekend, the brush with the man's uncontrolled anger still rang in my young colleague's ears. How do I know this? When I asked her what she did over the weekend, it was the first thing she told me about.""It's still so bizarre to me that someone would do that,"" she said. Bizarre among normal people, yes. As CNN noted in a story about the killing spree that left six college students dead and 13 injured at Rodgers' hands, ""No, not all men channel frustration over romantic rejection into a killing spree. But yes, all women experience harassment, discrimination or worse at some point in their lives.""No, not every c*nt-caller creates a digital footprint detailing his intentions to ""destroy everything I cannot have,"" and blaming the ""cruelness of women"" for his ""day of retribution."" And no, not every c*nt-caller stabs three people to death, mows down innocents on bikes and shoots at sorority sisters because he feels misunderstood and unloved and unable to get laid when he wants. But there is a connection. It is the same rage, the same misogyny. And women, they get it.It was what inspired Twitter users to tweet the hashtag #YesAllWomen. As Huffington Post reported, ""women have been sharing stories of what they've had to put up with, from discrimination to sexual assault, while pointing out the many ways misogyny has become almost acceptable."" And that's the point: Calling someone a ""c*nt"" fellas? It's just not acceptable."
1,POLITICS,How A Farm-To-Table Program Could Revitalize Prisons,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-inmate-farm-program_n_5400670.html,,2014-05-28,"Inmates play soccer in the yard at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, California, U.S., on Wednesday, March 26, 2014. California is under a federal court order to lower the population of its prisons to 137.5 percent of their designed capacity after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a ruling that inmate health care was so bad it amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. Photographer: Sam Hodgson/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cacb200000c70101cf1b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A unique prison rehabilitation program launching in California may be the most powerful interpretation of farm-to-table the state has ever seen.San Diego’s Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility is building sites for its new Farm and Rehabilitation Meals (FARM) program, a fresh project that hires inmates as farmers, teaches them sustainable agriculture practices and -- if approved by prison health authorities -- will put the produce on inmates’ cafeteria tables.The facilities will first accommodate 20 inmate farmers, organizers told The Huffington Post, and will include three acres of farmland on prison grounds, worm castings off-site, a classroom, and raised garden beds accessible to the prison’s relatively large disabled population.“Within those spaces we’re going to teach community gardening, composting and water-wise gardening,” said Wehtahnah Tucker, the program’s coordinator and a California Correctional Health Care Services (CCHCS) executive. “We’re purchasing a cistern, using gray water and capturing rainwater for use.”The prison’s health care staff came up with the idea for FARM after noting astounding recidivism rates amongst inmates at similar programs. According to studies conducted at those facilities, Tucker told HuffPost, inmate farmers had prison reentry rates of only 5 to 10 percent -- a jaw-dropping figure compared to California’s abysmal 61 percent recidivism rate, one of the highest in the country. Despite the program’s promise, Tucker says these farms are “extremely uncommon” and that she is only familiar with two others in the U.S., one at California’s San Quentin State Prison and one at Rikers Island in New York City.The first phase of the program costs $4,000 and has been entirely funded by private groups and individuals, all in partnership with Wild Willow Farms, a nearby school for sustainable farming, and the San Diego Community College District, Tucker told HuffPost.“We wanted to create more opportunities for inmates to have a more meaningful experience while they’re here, so when they leave, they can not come back,” Tucker said. “We want them to be productive while they’re incarcerated … and show that when they’re invested in something, they have something they can look to as an achievement.”She said the inmates have been extremely excited about the program, noting that a contest that called on them to create a FARM logo received so many good submissions that several of them will now be featured. “[The inmates] have said, ‘I really want to make something, create something and keep it,’” Tucker explained. “Prison is a place where ownership doesn’t really exist. When you’re incarcerated, everything that exists is very temporary. One of the things they said would make them feel like they achieved something is just that feeling, even if they’re just harvesting something.” The program is also an opportunity for inmates to learn about nutrition and ensure a healthy diet, CCHCS public information officer Liz Gransee told HuffPost, adding that the plan is to incorporate the farm’s food into the prison kitchen but that it must undergo an approval process first. Alternately, the produce will go to local food banks.“We have approximately 3,300 inmates, so getting in fresh produce is certainly a difficult undertaking,” Tucker said, explaining FARM could eventually save money. “With it on site, it would it would certainly ease that.”She hopes that participating inmates will more easily gain employment upon release, especially in San Diego where sustainable agriculture skills are in high demand. Eventually, she’d like to offer inmates who work at FARM a certificate verifying their agricultural skills.“The ideal inmate [for FARM] is one who really sees this as an opportunity,” she said, “who knows that this is a privilege.”"
2,TASTE,Who Are These Ladies And How Are They Rocking the World Of German Craft Beer?,"Tom Conrad, ContributorChristmas design expert, antique dealer, travel operator and b...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-happens-when-your-an_b_5400848.html,Their craft beers are as un-girly as you can imagine.,2014-05-28,2014-05-28-MEINEL2.HP.TreasureofEuropeTours.com.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-28-MEINEL2.HP.TreasureofEuropeTours.com-thumb.png,"Imagine that your ancestors have been making beer since 1731. You're going to be hard-coded to be a brewer too. Right?That pretty much describes the Meinel sisters. But what happened when they took over the family business? Not what you'd expect.The Meinel family has the kind of serious Bavarian beer cred that only goes to brewers who have been making beer for a long time. In their case, a really long time. Twelve generations of the family have tended the brew kettle for 285 years, turning out beer that has a reputation stretching far beyond Hof, the remote town near the Czech border in the Bavarian region of Franconia, where it is brewed. Ladies Who LagerEnter Gisela and Monika Meinel, two classy, spirited twenty-something sisters who are taking over the Meinel Brewery, pioneering new insurgent beer styles and rocking the Bavarian beer scene in the process. We're talkin' revolution.The Meinel sisters are among a small group of women brewers in Germany -- Ladies Who Lager -- who are turning heads. There are three things you need to know in order to grasp just how daring the sisters are and how improbably edgy the beer they brew is.The first is that if you live in Germany, you consider Hof to be at the outer edge of the universe. A sweet town it is. But it's not even kind of a hotbed of innovation or hipness. And it's as far from cool craft brewing hubs like Hamburg and Berlin as you can imagine which makes it an exceedingly unlikely place for a beer revolution.The second thing to understand is how the weight of tradition plus economic pressures and local beer styles that are slow to change are bearing down on the sisters as they take the reins of the family brewery. These factors alone would be enough to make anybody think twice about rocking the boat by launching iffy new beers. The third thing to remember is that the Meinels are women. And, as in the U.S., beer and brewing in Germany still tend to revolve around men. Times are changing but the sisters still contend with stereotypes in the industry. Lesser brewers would cave. They would resist the temptation to experiment with new styles and stick to tried-and-true brews -- in other words, they would not make waves. But the Meinel sisters have embraced change and are proving in spades that they're not conformists.Beer Awesomeness EnsuesTogether with brewers Yvonne Wernlein and Isabella Straub, the Meinels are rolling out new craft beers for women. Fringy? Yes. Daring? For sure. Especially in a traditional beer bastion like Franconia. But the first batch sold out in a matter of weeks. The four lady brewers are still at it, and the latest in their lineup is called ""Summer Night's Dream."" Another is on the way for the fall.  Before you get the wrong idea: These are not Shirley Temple brews. The sisters and their co-conspirators are definitely aiming for styles that appeal to women, but their craft beers are as un-girly as you can imagine. These are strong, sophisticated, aromatic and memorable brews. The idea of women's beer isn't without its critics. But the Meinels and their friends are not trying to segregate women drinkers. That's why they don't buy into the stereotype that women only like thin, sweet beers. The Meinels' brews are headier and have more alcohol. They work as an aperitif, with food, as a digestif or in stand-alone mode. Judging from the response, they appeal to women but they're also definitely bro-friendly. Beer Worth Traveling ForOther new-wave entries from the Meinel brewhouse include Absolvinator (double bock); a spring wheat beer called Meinels Blümla; Mephisto, a malty aromatic craft beer; and a special wheat bock available from October through Christmas which has won silver and gold at the European Beer Star Awards. These new creations beckon craft beer connoisseurs and geeks like a siren's song. But unfortunately they're not available in the U.S. or anywhere else outside Germany. The best place to enjoy them is in Germany on a beer tour, preferably at the Meinel Brewery itself. They're definitely worth traveling for.Shifting the Beer and Brewing ParadigmDespite progress in some areas, when it comes to beer and brewing, we still live in a time when women are stuck in supporting roles. Ladies are either models in beer ads, waitresses at the Oktoberfest or designated drivers who make sure their boyfriends get home safe after a night of drinking. But with their very presence in the brewing world and their insistence on making sophisticated beers for women (and men), the Meinel sisters are shattering these and other stereotypes about women, beer and brewing that are badly in need of shattering.The Meinel sisters are here to stay. ""We're doing this because of our convictions, not because some marketing department told us to do it,"" they say. The Meinels may not have intended it, but they are shifting the beer and brewing paradigm with their hybrid approach. They have one foot in the camp of tradition and the other in the craft beer camp, which means they are preserving the best in age-old venerable Franconian beer styles and turning out the best in innovative craft beer. It's a revolution we can get behind and a win-win for craft beer lovers.--------Tom Conrad will lead a small band of beer lovers, craft beer enthusiasts and Slow Food fans on a beer and brewery trip to Germany in October.

3,ENTERTAINMENT,The 5 Most Undateable Sitcom Characters,"Adam Sztykiel, ContributorCreator and Executive Producer, ""Undateable""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/most-undateable-sitcom-characters_b_5400284.html,"In honor of this Thursday's premiere of Undateable, I thought it would be appropriate to look back at TV's rich history of undateables. Some were clearly undateable at the time, others only in retrospect.",2014-05-28,SEINFELD -- Pictured: Jason Alexander as George Costanza (Photo by Andrew Eccles/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb45d3d3c000032000c9695.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In honor of this Thursday's premiere of Undateable (9 p.m., NBC), I thought it would be appropriate to look back at TV's rich history of undateables. Some were clearly undateable at the time, others only in retrospect. Keep in mind, these are just one person's thoughts -- I'd love to know who you think the most undateable characters in TV history are, and please watch Undateable, Thursdays at 9 p.m. on NBC!THE FONZ, Happy Days: Fonzie is undateable because of his sketchy past. Don't get me wrong, The Fonz has some great stuff going for him. He's loyal, he's got fantastic hair, he sticks up for people who can't stick up for themselves. And he's ""The Fonz"" -- he's the coolest. (The man jumped a shark on water skis, while wearing a leather jacket. It doesn't get any cooler than that, right?) But here's what we also know about Arthur Fonzarelli. Fonzie is a former member of the notorious Milwaukee motorcycle gang, The Falcons. I've watched Sons of Anarchy. You have to do some pretty dark stuff as a member of a motorcycle club. You're probably saying: ""Maybe Fonzie was the bad boy with the heart of gold and he never really did anything that bad!"" Here's the thing: Happy Days is pretty clear that The Fonz has an infamous reputation in the Milwaukee street gang scene, and most of the gang members he runs across are terrified at the mere sight of him. Now, you'd have to be a seriously bad MF'er to strike instant fear in the hearts of the most dangerous dudes in town. I'm not saying the The Fonz curb-stomped someone... but I'm not saying he didn't. (It should be noted that The Fonz fixes EVERYTHING by punching it.) Finally, and probably even more undateable than his former gang affiliations, Fonzie is never willing to admit he's wrong and always refuses to say ""I'm sorry,"" which are always great building blocks for every relationship.CLIFF CLAVIN, Cheers: In his own words, ""There's actually no rule against mailmen dating women. It just sort of turns out that way."" God bless, Cliffy. He's your prototypical lovable loser and a classic undateable. He lived with his mother in his childhood home, until he moved into a condo... also with his mom. All of Cliff's spare time is spent at a bar. And he is a big time know-it-all, constantly boring the people around him with his little known useless facts.GEORGE COSTANZA, Seinfeld: The self-proclaimed ""Lord of the Idiots"" is the gold standard by which all other undateables should be measured. He is an admitted and proud liar, possibly a sociopath, definitely a narcissist, has anger management issues, and is also a hypochondriac. He enjoys lying about his occupation (architect, marine biologist, latex salesman for Vandelay Industries to name a few), he created a fake charity (The Human Fund -- ""Money For People!"") to avoid buying holiday gifts for his co-workers, and also pretended to be disabled in order to get his own, private bathroom at work. George is not a brave man, as evidenced when a fire started at a child's birthday party and he knocked down everyone in his way, including an elderly woman with a walker, to get out. Oh, and he accidentally killed his fianceé, Susan, with the toxic glue on the envelopes he picked out for their wedding invitations. And the doctor's summary of George's reaction to the news of Susan's death? ""Restrained jubilation."" He then called old-fling, Marisa Tomei to see if she wanted to go out, after the funeral. R.I.P. Susan Biddle Ross.JOEY TRIBBIANI, Friends: You're probably thinking, ""Please! Ross was a whiner and Chandler had a third nipple -- Joey is the most dateable of the Friends guys! How is a guy who went on so many dates, 'undateable'?"" That's the thing -- Joey is undateable because he's been around. Reddit user larry_b took the time to calculate the number of sex partners each of the Friends had during the run of the series. Here are larry_b's findings.According to the research, ""How you doin'?"" did pretty well for old Joe. Joey had sex with 51.5 women. (larry_b gives half points for probable but unconfirmed sexual encounters). And, again, that's only during the run of the show. It doesn't count the women he was with before the friends started hanging out at Central Perk, nor does it count the women he was with after, which includes an episode of Joey in which Joey gets to judge a beauty pageant, sleeps with one of the contestants, and then decides the only way to remain a fair and impartial judge is to sleep with all of them. So, if you're a person who likes a man with a lot of ""experience"", then Joey is your guy. If not, you're probably better off with Chandler (10.5 partners). Also, Joey doesn't share food.SHELDON COOPER, The Big Bang Theory: Sheldon is proudly undateable -- dating genuinely doesn't seem to interest him. But even if it did, Sheldon definitely has his quirks, to say the least. Yes, he's a genius, but he knows it and loves to let everyone around him know it, too. As Sheldon puts it: ""My brain is better than EVERYBODY'S!!"" He has a major superiority complex, which pairs nicely with his narcissism, complete lack of empathy, and zero social skills. Sheldon's a germaphobe and a hypochondriac and, as a result, not really into physical contact with other humans. So if you desire intimacy of any kind, and I do mean any kind (don't hold your breath for a hug, and if you do get one it will be awkward and painful for both of you), Sheldon is not your man. He also has four restraining orders against him, from Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy, Bill Nye The Science Guy, and the late Carl Sagan. That's a lot of restraining orders. Red flag.HONORABLE MENTION: VICKI, Small Wonder. #Undateable because she was a robot. Sorry robots."
4,SCIENCE,Nicholas Wade and Race: Building a Scientific Façade,"Jennifer Raff, ContributorAssistant Professor of Physical Anthropology, University of Ka...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nicholas-wade-and-race-building-a-scientific-facade_b_5375137.html,"Wade can't justify his first and primary point: his claim that the human racial groups we recognize today culturally are scientifically meaningful, discrete biological divisions of humans.

Physical anthropologists and human biologists have been studying race (e.g., blacks vs. whites, or Europeans vs. Asians) for centuries. For most of that time, they subscribed to the perspective that race was a taxonomic category, and they sought to identify the biological characteristics (such as cranial shape or skin color) that characterized and defined these different groups. This perspective assumed that the differences between racial categories were biological, and that these categories were predictive of other traits (such as ancestry, temperament, intelligence, or health).But it gradually became clear that this understanding was not scientifically sound. Groupings of people by skin color did not produce the same result as groupings of people by skull shape or blood type. Furthermore, as scientists began to study human variation with the tools of genetics (in the process creating my fields, anthropological genetics and human population genetics), it became apparent that human genetic variation does not divide humans into a few discrete groups. There are virtually no sharp boundaries, either with physical features or with patterns of genetic diversity, that show where one population ""ends"" and the next ""begins.""These observations have led the majority of physical anthropologists, human biologists, and human geneticists in recent decades to conclude that the racial groups we recognize are social categories constructed in a specific cultural and historical setting, even if we consider physical features when categorizing people. These social categories can have biological consequences. (For example, someone who experiences the stress of racism may be more likely to develop high blood pressure and hypertension than someone who does not.)However, according to former New York Times science writer Nicholas Wade, we should never have stopped thinking of race as a taxonomic category. In his new book, A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History, Wade claims that the latest genomic findings actually support dividing humans into discrete races, and that the genetic makeup of different races contributes to behavioral and economic disparities. Others have already critiqued this book, particularly Wade's storytelling in chapters 6 through 10 (""a much more speculative arena,"" as he puts it), in which he explains that English populations have a genetically based ""willingness to save and delay gratification,"" and that Jews are adapted for capitalism in a manner analogous to the Eskimos' adaptation to survival in an Arctic environment (p. 214) -- assertions unsupported by scientific evidence, to put it mildly. I'm far more interested in the central premise of Wade's argument, which is passing unchallenged by all but a few reviews. To support his claim, Wade relies heavily on a 2002 paper (by Rosenberg et al.) that used a program called structure to group people based on similarities in markers distributed across the genome. He notes that the program identified five major clusters in this 2002 study, which corresponded to the major geographic regions (Africa, Eurasia, East Asia, Oceania, and America) of the world. Therefore, Wade argues, these results clearly show that humans are divided into racial categories that match continents.But structure didn't simply identify five clusters. It also identified two, three, four, six, and seven clusters. (Rosenberg et al. 2002 actually identified up to 20 divisions, but 1 through 7 are the primary ones they discussed. They also divided their worldwide sample into regions and then ran structure within those regions to look at more fine-scale population structure.)Why? Researchers using structure have to define the number (K) of clusters in advance, because that's what the program requires. The program was designed to partition individuals into whatever pre-specified number of clusters the researcher requests, regardless of whether that number of divisions really exists in nature. In other words, if the researcher tells structure to divide the sampled individuals into four clusters, structure will identify four groups no matter what. Structure's results are extremely sensitive to many different factors, including models used, the type and number of genetic variants studied, and the number of populations included in the analysis (Rosenberg et al. 2005).Figure 1 from Rosenberg et al. 2002 showing structure runs at two, three, four, five, and six populations. Each population is separated by a black line. Each thin vertical line represents one person. Ancestry groupings inferred from the program on the basis of genetic similarity are represented by different colors, so that a thin vertical line that is approximately 60-percent purple and approximately 40-percent orange indicates a person who was inferred to have 60-percent ancestry from the ""purple"" genetic cluster and 40-percent ancestry from the ""orange"" genetic cluster.So when Rosenberg et al. 2002 told structure to use K=6, they got six clusters, with the sixth corresponding to a northwestern Pakistani group, the Kalash. Does this make the Kalash a separate race? Wade doesn't think so. When they told structure to use K=3, they got three clusters back, corresponding to Africa, Europe/Middle East/South Asia, and East Asia/Oceania/Americas. So are Native Americans and Australians not separate races? Rosenberg et al. never published any statistical evidence that justifies picking five races instead of seven, or four, or two (although such methods do exist; see Bolnick et al. 2008). Wade seems to like K=5 simply because it matches his preconceived notions of what race should be:It might be reasonable to elevate the Indian and Middle Eastern groups to the level of major races, making seven in all. But then many more subpopulations could be declared races, so to keep things simple, the five-race, continent-based scheme seems the most practical for most purposes. (p. 100)Practical. Simple. So by his own admission, Wade wants us to cut up human diversity into five races not because that's what the statistical analyses show but because thinking about it as a gradient is hard.I've focused this review on technical details because I think that it's important that non-geneticists understand how Wade is distorting the results of recent research on genome-wide human variation. I won't speculate on whether this distortion is deliberate or a result of simple ignorance about genetics, but it is serious. Wade's book is all pseudoscientific rubbish, because he can't justify his first and primary point: his claim that the human racial groups we recognize today culturally are scientifically meaningful, discrete biological divisions of humans. This claim provides a direct basis for the whole second half of the book, in which he makes speculative arguments about national character. In other words, the entire book is a house of cards.This post originally appeared on the author's personal blog.

It's a classic, happy question you'll hear with increasing frequency this time of year all over England. Pimm's is a British liqueur that was first made by shellfish-monger James Pimm in 1823. Pimm served a ""house cup"" flavored with liqueurs and fruit extract at his London Oyster bar, and it was so popular that by 1851, Pimm's turned into a full-fledged business, selling Pimm's No. 1 Cup by the bottle.Pimm's No. 1 Cup is gin-based, and while the exact recipe is unknown, it's something like a fruity, herby sweet vermouth. Summer is Pimm's season, where you'll find people all over England drinking Pimm's in a cocktail with lemonade, mint, cucumber, strawberries and orange slices. (English lemonade is closer to 7 Up than our fresh-squeezed lemon version.) Luckily for us Americans, Pimm's is also popular across the pond.If you've never had a Pimm's Cup, the classic cocktail is a great place to start.

In fact, the Internet keeps doing this . It seems to be the only way mainstream media want to cover feminism. And this is a problem.Young women talking about feminism is important. But focusing only on which young, famous women embrace or reject the label of ""feminist"" essentially reduces the issue of equal rights to a hashtag.Media need to be writing more stories about what feminism is, rather than which celebrity just dropped the f-bomb -- or dissed it, whatever the case may be.I admit I have written about this myself -- a few times. But my argument in this arena has always been: Allow young women to evolve. If along that journey they discover feminism and choose to identify as feminist, that's fantastic. But let's not kick them so much along their way that they're left feeling rejected by women, which is the antithesis of feminism.Shailene Woodley is the latest victim after her comments about feminism were published in Time earlier this month. The media tornado is still swirling. The latest is a New York Times story this week that analyzes all of the young women in Hollywood on their ""feminist or not"" declarations and asks the question: Does it matter?It does matter. Of course it matters. As Martha Plimpton said in the Times piece:I take a lot of pride in calling myself a feminist and always have. We're going to have to insist on correcting bigotry as it happens, in real time. And fear of women's equality, or the diminishment of it, is a kind of bigotry. I think it's important to remove the stigma associated with women's equality, and as such, yes, normalizing the word 'feminist' and making sure people know what it means is incredibly important, whether we're talking to celebrities or anyone. Plimpton is quoted a lot in stories about celebrities and feminist identity. But she's rarely interviewed about the work her organization, A Is For, does to advocate for reproductive rights. I'm sure she'd rather be called by a reporter to discuss all the pending legislation that seeks to end access to abortion care than muse on a twenty-something starlet's idea of feminism.Still, I trust Plimpton talking about feminism because she has established a feminist identity -- something that often takes years and, you know, growing up to acquire -- and she does actual feminist work. But let's stop asking young Hollywood about feminism for the sake of headlines. These are not the experts of the feminism movement. Megan Murphy of the blog Feminist Current echos my point in a recent post:It's like asking me about Judaism or the raw food movement -- I have no opinion and if you force me to come up with one I'm going to come off as an idiot. Those are not my areas of expertise. Lots of areas are not my areas of expertise. What's with so many interviewers asking female musicians or actresses about feminism? Why not just ask a feminist? I'll take that even further: It's the job of journalists to ask questions in the pursuit of discovering new information. Let's start asking questions like, ""Why do women still make less money than men?"" or ""Why don't international governments allocate resources to stopping sex slavery and forced marriage?"" or ""What are the consequences when abortion care is denied?"" or ""When is the U.S. ever going to get its sh*t together on standardized family leave and child care?"" These questions are more than mere hash tags; they are the core of what feminism stands for. Let's talk more about that.Originally published on Heather's Tumblr."
