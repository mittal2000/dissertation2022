But when it comes to stress relief, not all yoga poses are created equal: Some positions are particularly effective for promoting relaxation, tension relief and restfulness. ""Yoga helps us slow down for a moment and tune into the breath. Simply the focus on one thing -- which is the very definition of meditation -- allows us to decompress,"" Dr. Terri Kennedy, registered yoga teacher and president of Power Living Enterprises, Inc. told The Huffington Post. ""The actual asanas [poses] release tension in different ways, and help certain parts of the body."" Seated postures like child's pose can induce feelings of calm and help put the mind in a meditative state, while empowering positions like standing forward bend and eagle pose can calm the mind while also energizing the body.

2,WELLNESS,Finding Meaning,"Dr. Karen Derris, Contributor
Professor of Religion",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tibeten-buddhism_us_5b9d0143e4b03a1dcc83b4b0,"The Karmapa offered my students, and me, a rare gift in inviting us to define how we will make our lives meaningful for ourselves and others.",2013-04-06,Girl photographing the Taj Mahal with a smartphone,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d01432000003000fdcc58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""If you could talk to a spiritual master, what would you want to ask him?"" I emailed this clichéd question to a number of my college students in the summer of 2010 hoping it might generate sincere responses. I had just received a remarkable invitation to bring a group of college students to spend a month in conversations with His Holiness the 17th Karmapa, one of the most significant teachers in Tibetan Buddhism and an emerging figure in global Buddhism, at his home at Gyuto monastery in Northern India. The Karmapa wanted to learn of the concerns, ideas and passions of young adults in the United States, and how together they might speak across the borders of culture, nationality or religion. I was overwhelmed by the students' heartfelt and thoughtful responses: students described their concerns for the environment, social discrimination and injustice and how to construct a life that holds meaning in our consumer-driven society. How could they shape their lives to bring about productive change? How could they become more compassionate toward others and themselves? What should they do with their lives and careers to find personal satisfaction and also contribute to the world? Their questions gave rise to the topics we discussed with the Karmapa in India. His teachings on these topics became the basis for the chapters in his book, The Heart is Noble: Changing the World from the Inside Out (Shambala 2013), which is now available. Many of us share these same questions. So many of us also hope to find new perspectives to explore how we might be more compassionate toward the world, to others, and to ourselves. For three weeks, 16 students from the University of Redlands accompanied me on a profoundly transformative journey to learn from the Karmapa's unique perspective on how we can create a meaningful life. The Karmapa's vantage point is a rare one: He was just 25 during our visit, just a few years older than most of the students in the course. While he shared their youth, his wisdom seemed ageless; as the holder of the 900-year-old Karma Kagyu Lineage, he was the spiritual head of one of Tibetan Buddhism's four schools. He had been recognized as the 17th Karmapa when he was only seven years old while living with his nomadic family in Eastern Tibet in an essentially pre-technological society. Unlike my students' concerns about making the best or right choice as they set out to construct their adult lives, the Karmapa's role in life was decided with his recognition and enthronement as the 17th Karmapa. While their life trajectories seemed to be so vastly different, the Karmapa urged us to focus not solely upon what we do, or the particular roles we fill in life, but how we approach whatever it is that we do. When we approach our commitments and responsibilities with an aspiration to bring compassion to the world around us, any action, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant can be meaningful. The Karmapa taught us to reframe our original questions; we need not determine the right choice about what will be meaningful; instead, we can focus on the inner choices that enable us to approach everything we do with meaning.The time the Karmapa generously shared with the University of Redlands students was an experience in Global Education of a most unusual kind, and yet it suggests several valuable orientations that any of us might think about when we seek to live in a more compassionate, meaningful way. First, just gaining a basic awareness that there are many different ways that meaning is defined creates endless opportunities to author our own. For example, as young adults starting professional lives in the U.S., my students carried the expectations of financial gain and status as measures of success. What would make for a meaningful life didn't really even seem to be a part of the equation. The Karmapa offered other vantage points, particularly about the basic, inherent goodness of human beings. The possibilities for defining success by other measures such as happiness, kindness and compassion speak to our natural capacity for goodness, and this approach can be used by anyone.But redefining success is just the starting point. Another tool is having the courage to try out other ways of being in the world. That openness can start with resetting our attitudes about expectations. In preparing for our trip, we attempted to avoid bringing our own expectations to the experience. We set for ourselves the goal of responding to whatever was presented to us, for none of us could fully imagine what our experience would be like once we were at Gyuto Monastery with His Holiness the Karmapa. The students wondered, Who were they  to be representing the view of the ""American college student"" on these important issues? Our doubts turned out to be entirely unnecessary. His Holiness the Karmapa reflected back to us our sincerity and openness to care for each other and the world, and taught us that we needed nothing else in order to be worthy of this encounter. Anyone with an open heart and good intentions was fully welcome to receive his teachings.Trying out other ways of being in the world does not have to require large changes; relatively small changes can lead to a more meaningful life. For example, one of the precepts we followed was keeping a vegetarian diet while in India, inspired by His Holiness the Karmapa's vision of vegetarianism as a central ethical and activist issue. The students all voluntarily fulfilled this commitment, and many later reflected that this was an important part of their experience of self-discovery.The Karmapa offered my students, and me, a rare gift in inviting us to define how we will make our lives meaningful for ourselves and others. The students left India without the easy answer of being told what they should do for their lives they may originally hoped for, but they gained the confidence to shape a meaningful life for themselves in whatever forms it will take.For more by Dr. Karen Derris, click here.

3,PARENTING,Frank Bruni On Parenting: Was He Clear-Eyed Or Clueless?,Lisa Belkin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/frank-bruni-on-parenting_us_5b9d029fe4b03a1dcc83c126,"I’m here to say that he is right. But not for the reasons he thinks. With due respect to Gross, they sure ring true to me",2013-04-06,Mother and daughter in bakery section of supermarket. Daughter with cookies,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d029f2100005100c559ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before I had children I had rules about raising those children. Snacking, for instance. I would roll my eyes and tsk to myself whenever a parent pulled out a bag o’ snacks and starting offering cracker shaped like goldfish or teddy bears to their whining youngsters. My kids were going to have regular mealtimes! And bedtimes! And never use a pacifier! And know who’s boss! There would be no TV on school nights! Whining would never be rewarded! Frank Bruni apparently has these rules too. He listed them last weekend in The New York Times, and all week parents have been weighing in telling him he’s wrong. I’m here to say that he is right. But not for the reasons he thinks. His portrait of parents last Sunday was one of ineffectual boobs -- always muttering “last chance” to their children without ever following through; negotiating constantly with toddlers; endless puffing up their youngsters' self esteem; whipsawing between too controlling and completely out of control. Response from parents was quick and outraged. The latest, on the Atlantic's website yesterday was titled “Do Today’s Parents Need to Relax? Or Does Frank Bruni?”  “Over the course of 1,285 words,” Matt Gross writes, “[Bruni] rails at straw dads and straw moms, describing clichéd scenarios—a parent threatening ‘seven or eight’ last chances, a discussion of child eating habits ‘within earshot of little Edwin or Edwina’—that, while certainly plausible, don't quite have the ring of truth.”With due respect to Gross, they sure ring true to me. Or, more to the point, they feel true. I have been that parent who has seen her best intentions evaporate when confronted with an actual child. I have had the out of body experience of watching as if from above while breaking nearly every rule I ever made. I still carry snacks with me everywhere, a habit I got into as soon as I learned that my kids are angels when their blood sugar is stable and not so much when it isn’t. I stretched a reasonable definition of bedtime as I learned that one boy was non-functional with less than 12 hours of sleep while the other was born with the body clock of a wombat and got agitated and crabby if put in bed before he was able to sleep. The one who didn’t use a pacifier sucked his thumb, so his brother got a pacifier. Whining just plain wore me down -- they should use it against terror suspects at Guantanomo. So much easier to give in, particularly when exhausted (see kid who stayed up all night because of his body clock.) While I agree with Bruni about his portrayal of parents, though, I take issue with most of the rest of what he says -- and, in the end, his right to say it. In his op-ed piece he describes himself as “baffled” and “confounded” by the inconsistencies and contradictions of the parents he sees around him. True, he doesn’t have children, he says, but believes he has “a valuable distance and objectivity as a result.” No, Frank. You don't. You have distance, sure, but it is far from objective and, as a result isn’t all that valuable. You have the opinions that everyone who isn’t a parent has before they become a parent -- the idea that this can’t possibly be as complicated as these poor saps are making it seem. But here is one of the few things I know for sure about parenting: everyone with kids was once someone without kids, so we know how things look from your side of the changing table. No one who’s never been a parent, though, can say the same. So you just have to believe us. Please take our word that “today’s parents” did not become such in a vacuum -- didn’t wake up one morning and say “I am going to become a caricature that Frank Bruni can have fun with today.” Yes, as a group we hover (too much) over our children, but we do so in the context of a world that is more complicated and threatening, that puts more pressure on them and therefore on us. True, we spend far too much time discussing their every bite and morsel, activity and test score, success and failure. But understand that’s because every day there is a report or a study that tells us how much each of these things count. And yeah, we worry too much about who is watching and judging. But that’s because so many people are. Heck, you certainly are. Should you ever have your own Edwin or Edwina, I can’t say for certain that you would become exactly the kind of parent you find so contradictory and ineffectual. I can assure you of this, though -- you would be nothing at all like the parent you think you would be. None of us are. "

(AP Photo/Evan Agostini)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2eea7260000cf0081fb70.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recently we were shocked, like thousands of other parents, to see Victoria's Secret's ""Bright Young Things"" advertisement for their PINK line of underwear.It's not that thongs meant for young women emblazoned with phrases like ""Call Me"" and ""Feeling Lucky?"" are entirely shocking coming from Victoria's Secret, but more that they insisted on comparing our young daughters to objects and things in order to sell them this lingerie. Victoria's Secret already makes millions off of sexualizing adult women (over 9 million people watched their most recent fashion show on national television) but now they're coming directly for our teens who are most vulnerable to the media's messaging.As parents of a daughter and a son (with another daughter on the way), we fear the impact this kind of messaging has on young generations, not to mention future ones. Not only is Victoria's Secret encouraging girls to sexualize themselves at younger and younger ages, but they're teaching men and boys to value girls' sexuality at younger and younger ages. This is dangerous. Though the company has since removed the most offensive products and ads from their website, the damage has already been done. And in any case, their larger message of objectification is still reaching our daughters -- especially through their youth-oriented PINK brand. The aforementioned fashion show, after all, starred pop idol Justin Bieber.The Chief Financial Officer of Victoria's Secret has said this about PINK: ""When somebody's 15 or 16 years old, what do they want to be? They want to be older, and they want to be cool like the girl in college, and that's part of the magic of what we do at PINK."" We're sorry, but when did it become ""cool"" for college women to spend so much time and energy trying to appeal to the male gaze? That's not the college experience we want for Montana or her sister. Hyper-sexualization and self-objectification are already national health problems, and as many as 60 percent of young women don't pursue the things they are most passionate about in life because of body dissatisfaction. Teaching teenage girls to see their value as a measure of how their body looks -- a central tenant of all Victoria's Secret advertising -- further limits their future possibilities in life.Yet it's not just Montana and her sister whom these hypersexualized images and slogans will impact, but her brother Hunter, who is growing up in the same media environment that objectifies and devalues women and girls. How does he learn to value and treat women? How does he learn to see his own masculinity as relates to the hyper-femininity promoted by Victoria's Secret? Certainly we parents have a responsibility to teach our children the truth and to have these important conversations with them as they grow older. But we're never the only ones teaching them how to think, what to do, or what to value.The average American teenager consumes nearly 11 hours of media daily -- that's way more than most parents interact with their kids each day. These harmful media messages about women and girls are on the clothes their friends wear to school, promoted by their idols on TV, rag magazines, and the Internet, and celebrated on mannequins and models in the storefronts and billboards they walk by (there are more than 1,000 Victoria's Secret stores in America, and probably one in your city's mall right now).As parents we can only do so much to shield them. At some point it becomes a social ill we must all contend with -- including the brands making millions on these harmful ideas.Let us all challenge the idea that our girls are objects for the male gaze and things to be sold to, rather than people to be loved, respected, and valued for more than our youth, beauty, and sexuality. As parents this is something we strive toward every day, but it's time corporations recognized their role as well."

Failure to comply with those measures could hurt employees' wallets.Workers at tire manufacturer company Michelin could miss out on reducing their deductibles by up to $1,000 if they show unhealthy signs like high blood pressure or waistlines over 40 inches, The Wall Street Journal reports. Companies such as Walmart and Home Depot have similar policies, designed to reduce surging health care costs. But often these new policies require employees to share personal health information, something critics say is both unfair and an invasion of privacy.With health care costs rising in 2012 to $12,136 per employee on average, according to a recent study, companies argue that the new policies not only help cut costs, but also contribute to the overall well being of their workforces. Indeed, Michelin told The Huffington Post that The Wall Street Journal’s claim that the company is penalizing workers for showing signs of obesity is not accurate. Instead, the new policy set to take effect next year “helps us help our employees” by rewarding workers who meet standards for at least three of five health indicators, such as waist size, cholesterol and blood pressure.CVS made a similar defense in March of its new “wellness review” policy, which will dock employees $600 if they elect not to disclose personal health information to the company’s insurance provider. The policy is designed to “help our colleagues engage more actively to improve their health and manage health-associated costs,” a CVS representative wrote The Huffington Post in an email in March.Fair or not, it’s likely that more companies will soon adopt stricter policies regarding employee health. Sixty percent said they plan on penalizing workers who don’t meet health standards in the future, according to a recent survey by Aon. Meanwhile, 80 percent say they’ll soon increase the cost of employee insurance premiums, a separate survey found."

(Photo by Daniel Boczarski/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb421002600003600824535.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Witnessing the outpouring of sentiment on Roger Ebert's death has been revelatory -- both a stunning testament to one man's outsize influence on film criticism over five decades, and more broadly, a timely reminder of the enduring importance of film in our society.Ebert certainly was on to something when he first sat down with fellow hometown Chicago critic Gene Siskel back in the late '70s to launch ""Sneak Previews."" Together they managed to turn movie discussion and debate into must-watch television. But Roger had the goods way before; it was evident from the first pieces he wrote for The Chicago Sun-Times more than a decade earlier.In building our own movie recommendation site, Ebert was a top referral source because he was such a brilliantly descriptive writer. Fundamentally, he watched and assessed movies as stories -- by which I mean he knew that good stories (by and large) were critical to outstanding films. Ebert had a genius for giving you the flavor of a story so that you could understand it, and he always knew just how far to go without getting into spoiler territory. There was no -- pardon me -- New York Times fussiness about his writing. It was clean, descriptive, yet could also transmit real feeling. Who could ever have doubted that Roger Ebert really and truly loved great movies?And he was most always fair and honest about movies he didn't care for. He was never mean-spirited. When a movie was condemned, you always felt it got the hearing it deserved.Ebert's passing is the passing of an era -- and he's left us at a time of transformation in what we watch and how we watch it. Of course, there are fewer critics we know and trust, and fewer newspapers in which to discover them. More often, viewers (particularly adults over 25) are choosing to rent or stream movies rather than go to movie theaters -- for price, convenience, and yes, quality -- reasons. (After all, much of what comes to the multiplex is clearly intended for a younger audience, and at around 10 bucks per ticket vs. three for streaming or renting, it's pretty easy to resist.)Also, technology is changing how we choose our next movie. Today we are more likely to pick something based on aggregated viewer ratings (IMDb), Netflix algorithms, or social media. Then again, we may be so wrapped up in those addictive paid cable series that we're simply not watching as many self-contained feature films anymore. This is in fact a trend on Netflix right now, which seems ironic, in that more great movies -- old and new, domestic and foreign, narrative and documentary -- are literally at our fingertips than ever before. And this emerging reality will only get more apparent in just the next few years.So, given this environment, and the reverence inspired by the life and legacy of Roger Ebert, shouldn't we take to heart -- and put it into practice -- what he stood for?This is what I personally take from his example: Use technology to find and watch great independent and foreign films that didn't make it to a theater near you -- or made it for about five minutes. Ebert believed that most movie fans are intelligent and recognize quality when they see it. Seek out that quality. If you are indeed what you eat, you are what you watch as well.Celebrate outstanding older films in general, and certainly if an outstanding new one is not at hand. If you read Ebert's Great Movies books, you discover the cinematic treasures of the past -- films he truly adored and appreciated. Watch them. Movies are like music -- the really good stuff refuses to get old.Watch great films again, and challenge your established viewpoint. As director Robert Altman said: ""It's better to see a great movie again, than an average one the first time. Because even though the movie hasn't changed, you have."" Ebert would screen certain movies after a period of time, and was never afraid to revise his opinion.Look for films that relate human stories. While we all crave entertainment, fantasy and escape from movies, some of our most enduring classics also teach important lessons about how to live. Ebert believed in the power of film to inform and enlighten, and always championed such films, when done well.Finally, spread joy and have fun all along the way -- with your movies, and in your life. This is ultimately what Ebert was all about, and he re-affirmed it -- gallantly and eloquently -- as death approached.For all he did, for all he was, for all he represented, a grateful public gives the late Roger Ebert an enthusiastic and heartfelt ""two thumbs up.""Looking for good movies to watch?

Waving US and rainbow flags, hundreds of gay marriage supporters braved the cold to rally outside the court along with a smaller group of opponents, some pushing strollers. Some slept outside in hopes of witnessing the historic hearing.

Published by the UCLA's Williams Institute, “Public Support for Marriage for Same-Sex Couples by State"" examines each state's current stance on the legality of marriage equality, as well as the overall change in public opinion since 2004. Over the past eight years, every U.S. state has increased in its support for same-sex marriage, with an average increase of 13.6 percent, and if the public opinion trends continue at the same pace, eight additional states will be above 50 percent support by the end of next year. But lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights advocates shouldn't get overly optimistic by the report's findings, as Williams Institute researchers pointed to what was described as ""a notable disparity"" that exists across state boundaries, according to a press release. Still, the findings seem in line with a number of other polls: a POLITICO and George Washington University survey found that, out of 1,000 likely voters, 40 percent of respondents said they support marriage equality, while 30 percent said they supported civil unions. Meanwhile, a LifeWay Research study released in March found that nearly two-thirds of Americans believe legalized same-sex marriage in the U.S. is inevitable.

Frieden said most of those who have become sick had direct contact with live poultry. Chinese health authorities are investigating the source of the infections. Frieden said they have reported positive cultures for a similar strain in both chickens and pigeons, and more testing is going on.Because this is a non-human virus, the worry is that it could cause a flu pandemic if it learned to become easily spread from person to person.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Vicki Allen and Philip Barbara)"
