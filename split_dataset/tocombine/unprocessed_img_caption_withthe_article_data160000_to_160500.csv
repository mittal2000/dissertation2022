Pharmaceutical companies, for example, pay fees to help fund the FDA's drug review process.Hamburg would like to explore more ideas with Congress, including requiring compounded drugs to have clear labels identifying the nature and source of the product.The meningitis outbreak was linked to a tainted steroid shipped last year by the New England Compounding Center (NECC), which filed for bankruptcy protection in December after U.S. authorities shut down its pharmacy operations in Framingham, Massachusetts.Since the NECC case came to light, the FDA has insisted that its authority over specialty pharmacies is too limited.""Even during this time of heightened awareness, our inspectors are being delayed in their work or denied full access to records at some of the facilities we are inspecting,"" Hamburg said.She added that serious problems at compounding pharmacies continue to occur. This week, there had been two recalls of sterile compounded and repackaged drug products.In one, the presence of floating particles later identified to be a fungus were reported in five bags of magnesium sulfate intravenous solution, resulting in a nationwide recall. In the other, all sterile drug products from a second pharmacy were recalled after reports that five patients suffered serious eye infections associated with a repackaged product.

""I was somebody who was not athletic. I was highly imaginative; I loved to read, and I loved nothing more than being in a story. ... I didn’t want to play ball; I wanted to imagine something and read something. That’s who the monster is.""Moore said she hopes the app is ""sweet and educational and fun"" rather than game-like.""When the computer and tablets are all about playing games, that’s not interesting to me. I don’t want them to have access to that kind of stuff all the time. I want there to be other things on there,"" she said.The Freckleface Strawberry books do deal directly with teasing -- but they’re not necessarily about ""bullying,"" Moore said. She takes great interest in the national debate on the topic and is intrigued by the argument Emily Bazelon makes in her new book, Sticks and Stones.""Certainly Freckleface Strawberry is not bullied,"" Moore said, explaining that the ""Dodgeball Bully"" who plays a title role in one of her stories -- a boy called Windy Pants Patrick who is scarily good at getting other kids ""out"" with the ball -- isn’t really aggressive; he’s just misunderstood. ""I don’t perceive [Windy Pants Patrick] as a bully; I perceive him as someone who people think is a bully. The thing about Dodgeball is that Windy Pants Patrick is misperceived by [Freckleface Strawberry]. And they eventually become best friends.""""One of the things [Bazelon] posits in her book is the idea that this bullying label has become sort of a huge thing, and -- it’s not specific enough. Because within childhood behaviors, there are known behaviors; there’s teasing and there’s name-calling, and different kinds of things happen as kids start to socialize. And then there’s serious bullying, and then there’s actual aggression and behavioral problems. But you can’t put it all under the tent of bullying. You can’t call it that because that’s not what it is.""Moore notes that the inspiration for the books actually came from her son, who felt self-conscious about the way he looked -- specifically, his ears and ""big teeth"" -- after he got a haircut at age 7.""It’s a time I think that’s critical in child development, where they suddenly see themselves as individual.""When her kids did get teased or felt left-out, Moore said they found her parenting style frustrating. ""They would come home and they would say, 'So-and-so is being mean,' and I’d say, 'Really, are they being mean, or you think someone’s being really mean to them? Let’s try to source the problem.' They’d be like, 'Mooom.'""In her own case, Moore said, it wasn’t just teasing that made her uncomfortable about her freckles as a kid -- she despised them all on her own. ""Kids hate anything that makes them feel different; at the time I was living in an environment where everybody got a tan and had blond skin, and I was like, ugh, why can’t I look like that? I think every human being has stuff that they feel that way about.""In her experience raising a girl and a boy, Moore said she hasn't noticed that either gender is more sensitive to the pressures of growing up than the other.""I don’t know that I could make differences in terms of gender, but I think you could make differences in terms of children. Every child is so different. Their experience growing up and their experience relating to the world has so much to do with their temperament, and their likes and their dislikes.""Also on HuffPost, via Positively Positive:"

A published report says Facebook is seeking a valuation of $85 billion to $95 billion when it goes public in a few weeks. The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, said Thursday May 3, 2012 that the company plans to set the per-share price of its stock in the high $20s to mid $30s.

The good, the bad and the ugly is being recorded and shared -- as we recently saw again in the horrific rape case in Steubenville, Ohio. I recommend that parents have a conversation with their children about safety when using different forms of social media -- from Facebook to texting and anything in between. Today, the culture seems to promote that ""anything goes"" in regards to self-expression. There needs to be a conversation about what is appropriate behavior and what actions could have huge repercussions that damage their reputation -- and are harmful to others.April is National Child Abuse Prevention Month -- a time to recognize that we each can play a part in promoting the social and emotional well-being of children and families in communities. Let's start by protecting our own children from the dangers that lurk in the Internet.Here are a few tips to keep your teen safe when using the Internet and other web-based technologies. If you think it's an awkward conversation; you can hand them this blog to read.• Be smart about what you post on the Web. It is a lot more public than it seems. Protect your space. Use privacy settings and don't just randomly accept everyone's request as a friend. Do a bit of investigating to find out more about them first. It's recommended that you don't use your real name or give out too much personal information on your Facebook page or other social media sites.• Clean up your profile. Take anything embarrassing, too personal or any photos that show you doing something illegal (drinking, drugs) off of your page. Those photos of you dancing with a beer bottle in your hand, are not going to look good when you are applying for college. • Provocative and sexy names and pictures can draw attention from people you don't want in your life, particularly online predators. • Posting or sending sexy photos of yourself (sexting) can get you into big trouble with the law. If you are underage, they may be considered child pornography, a serious crime. Never take an image of yourself that you wouldn't want your parents, teachers, or your employers to see. Think twice or three times before you post. You can't take it back and it's out there forever.• You have no control over where the photos are sent once you send them. The image that you meant for your boyfriend or girlfriend can be sent to their friends, and their friends and their friends. If you forward a sexual photo of someone underage, you are as responsible as the original sender. You could face child pornography charges, go to jail, and be legally required to register as a sex offender. You could also be asked to leave a sports team, be humiliated in public, or lose educational opportunities and have legal problems. Here is a video from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (2 minutes), where teens discuss the dangers of online posting.• Report any nude pictures that you receive on your cell phone to an adult that you trust. Do not delete the message; get your parents or your guardian, your teacher or school counselor involved immediately.• Be careful what you download or look at. Some images are extreme, and once you see it -- it's in your mind forever. This is particularly true for violent and/or pornographic images.• Adults who talk to you about sex online are committing a crime. So are adults who meet underage teens for sex. Some teens may think it's fun but it is serious trouble and best to report it to the police. You can also make a report by clicking here. • Be careful if you go in person to meet someone in person that you met on the Internet. You may think you know them well, but you don't. Tell your parents or someone you trust before you go. Don't go alone, bring a friend. Always meet in a public place. Make sure you have your cell phone and an exit plan. Here is a another video clip (2.40 minutes) where teens talk about bad experiences they had when meeting someone in person who they met online. The New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NYSPCC), the world's first child protection agency, will hold their annual Spring Luncheon on Thursday, April 18, 2013 at The Pierre Hotel in New York City.

You know, when you pretty much know that your teens are going to drink alcohol at a party so you debate to yourself about whether or not to have the party at your own house rather than risk having the teens drink at a friend or acquaintance's home.So, you most likely think to yourself that perhaps you should host the party at your house for many reasons including:1. You will be able to keep an eye on the kids.2. You will not allow the teens to drive if you notice that they are drunk.3. You will get a chance to get to know the friends of your own teens and perhaps they might even think that you are cool and will like you and open up to you.4. You will have the power to insist that the teens who are tired or not in good shape sleep at your home.AND5. You won't have to worry about your own teen's safety because s/he will be under your roof and your watchful gaze.Well, let me tell you that I DO NOT think that it is a good idea to bring the party home. And, I am well aware that lots of parents disagree with me because I talk to parent groups several times per month. I also talk to parents individually who believe that it is fine to bring the party home. I kid you not.I have several reasons for being adamantly opposed to bringing the party to your home. They include:1. You are basically giving underage kids the ability to drink freely and are thereby giving them the message that you think that this behavior is fine.2. You are allowing underage kids to do something that is not legal.3. I also assume that you are engaging in some sort of deceit. I doubt that you are making the other parents aware that alcohol will be flowing at your home.4. It is not your role to be seen as a friend or even as a ""cool"" parent.AND5. It is your role as a parent with good boundaries to model being a law-abiding citizen and responsible parent for your teen and for their friends.The answer to whether or not to bring the party home is a resounding NO. If you think that your teens will be drinking elsewhere then you can make it difficult for them to go to that situation or location. And, while you are at it explain what the consequences will be if you find out that they have been drinking. Set the rules and make sure that your teens are clear about the consequences and expectations. I am not saying that your teens will always be compliant but at least they will know where you stand on this issue.I have heard of too many teens dying because of alcohol overdoses and alcohol related traffic accidents and I wish these tragedies could be averted. I am asking for your help.Good luck, Barbara Greenberg PhD"

CDT** Angie Clark, a preschool teacher, reads to a group of four and five year old students, at Mitchell Elementary School, Tuesday March 29, 2011, in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP Photo/Steve Pope)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf37f3c00004c0009f5c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since President Obama proposed making high-quality preschool education available to every American four-year-old in his 2013 State of the Union address, the debate over the benefits of preschool has been thrown into the national spotlight.As every parent knows, preschool must all too often be purchased for a hefty price. In fact, for many parents, preschool expenses are one of the most surprising costs of having a young child.So many of us pay the asking price, but is that cost really necessary? Are there less expensive options? And is preschool itself really all that important?We spoke with the experts to help you decide how to best invest in your kids.How Much Will It Cost? About 30 percent of the country's 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in private preschools and childcare centers. Prices can vary radically depending on what kind of program you choose and where you live.Getting a firm number on cost is difficult. ""Data on the amount that parents are paying for private preschool programs is not collected in any nationwide effort,"" says Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) at Rutgers University.According to a recent report by Child Care Aware America, parents, on average, are paying anywhere between $3,900 (Mississippi) to nearly $11,700 (Massachusetts) per year for full-time, center-based care for a 4-year-old.Those numbers are even higher in urban areas. Live in New York and want to send your little one to Fieldston in Manhattan? That'll cost you $39,525 a year. Maybe you want your offspring to rub shoulders with the Obama girls at Sidwell Friends School in D.C. You'll be looking at $33,268 a year for the lower school.The Benefits of Preschool""Children need to develop a healthy and strong brain architecture,"" says Todd Grindal, an education expert at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. ""The experiences kids have in the early years have profound effects on their futures,"" he says. Considering a child's brain grows to 90 percent of its adult size by age five, the first few years are critical.Preschool aids this development in the following ways:Academic Achievement. Studies show that the benefits of preschool include overall academic achievement and school success, less grade repetition and special education and increased high school graduation rates. According to Barnett, high-quality preschool programs benefit children from middle-income families as well as from low-income families.School Readiness. ""A number of large-scale studies demonstrate that participation in high-quality, center-based pre-K programs positively influences all children's kindergarten readiness,"" says Barnett. ""Positive impacts include gains in achievement test scores, including early literacy and math skills, as well as improvements in social and emotional development.""Social/Emotional Development. Nobel Laureate James Heckman, an economist at the University of Chicago, has noted that the long-term impacts of early education on social and emotional development -- the skills that allow people to interact appropriately and effectively with others -- may be the most important takeaways from preschool.Social Progress. Heckman's research indicates a 7-10 percent annual return on investment in high-quality preschool, an ROI which has recently gained attention due to Obama's State of the Union address. Heckman argues that preschool is the time to teach kids the ""soft"" skills (like focusing, keeping an open mind and controlling their tempers) they'll eventually need to succeed in the job market.A 2010 report from the Institute for a Competitive Workforce concludes that ""for every dollar invested today, savings range from $2.50 to as much as $17 in the years ahead.""""High-quality preschool has also been found to reduce participants' future reliance on welfare and likeliness of being imprisoned,"" says Barnett. In fact, research from the Ounce of Prevention Fund shows that at-risk children who don't receive quality preschool education are 25 percent more likely than their peers to drop out of school and 70 percent more likely to be arrested for a violent crime.Can Kids Get By Without Preschool? As many parents can attest, there's a lot of pressure to send your kids to preschool. In fact, three-quarters of children ages 3 and 4 whose families have incomes of $75,000 and above are enrolled in preschool.But many parents seem conflicted about whether it's a need or a ""should.""Katy, a mother of two in Vancouver, believes kids can do just fine without preschool. ""I think children can learn all they need to from their parents and the families they socialize with, but that the socializing is important -- being with other kids, making relationships outside the family,"" she says. That said, her 4-year-old son attended preschool part-time, and her 2-year-old daughter will as well.Some parents feel that preschool is nothing but day care with a higher price tag -- but foregoing the experience comes at a price. ""Preschool is day care by another name,"" says Morgan, the father of a preschool grad in Alexandria, VA. ""But people feel that they have to do this stuff, or their kids will somehow miss a shot at getting into Harvard. It's the Toddler Industrial Complex.""And some industry critics argue that kids are better off at home with their parents. ""If family care is an option, that's certainly preferable to center-based programs,"" says Lindsey Burke, the Will Skillman Fellow in Education at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington D.C.Burke argues that preschool primarily benefits disadvantaged children. ""Even those benefits dissipate over time, leaving children who attended preschool no better off academically than those who did not,"" she says, pointing to recent research.Not so, says Barnett. ""The most recent peer-reviewed meta-analysis summarizes the results of 123 studies and found that despite some decline in effects after children entered school, on average, the effects did not disappear and remained substantial.""How Can You Get Preschool Without the Price Tag? Largely, the research shows that yes, kids are in need of the skill sets and socialization provided by the preschool experience.But can you extract those benefits without the traditional structure and its hefty price? ""Beyond proper nutrition and health care, kids need supportive relationships with caregivers and positive stimulation,"" says Grindal. If you're concerned with the price tag of more traditional preschools, consider one of these alternatives:Cooperative Preschools If you have some personal flexibility, a cooperative preschool, where parents take a more hands-on role, could be an option. In most co-ops, your tuition makes you a part-owner of the school, and while there is a formal teacher, you'll be expected to pitch in on a regular basis to experience your kid's classroom in action.Megan, a mom of two in Brooklyn, NY, originally thought preschool wasn't necessary. ""I thought the whole application process was madness,"" she says, referring to the 100-person wait lists, early application deadlines and stringent assessments for 2-year olds, not to mention the cost.Instead, she found a small cooperative preschool for her 3-year-old son. ""After seeing the positive effect it has had on him, I am totally pro-preschool,"" says Megan. ""His manners, concentration, and thought process have all improved so much,"" she says. ""He loves it and has a great relationship with all the kids and his teacher.""Structured at-Home Play Not sold on the necessity of preschool -- and willing and able to remain home with your child? In that case, be prepared to put together a ""program"" of activities that could include regular play dates, spending time at local parks, enrolling in age-appropriate classes and visiting your library, museums and craft stores.Melanie, a mom of three in Montgomery County, MD, chose not to enroll her youngest child in preschool. A former teacher, she sent her 9- and 11-year-old daughters to part-time preschool when they were 4. ""For us, preschool was mainly for socializing with other kids and to prepare them to work with a teacher other than myself,"" she says.Why did she keep her 4-year-old son home? ""I felt comfortable with the amount of socializing he was doing through play dates and various classes,"" she says. She's now teaching her son to read and uses hands on, play-based activities to stimulate conversations on math, science and history.""I truly do believe in preschool,"" says Melanie. ""But I knew for our family I would be able to cater to my son's individual academic needs in a style I preferred.""LearnVest's free Money Center will help you create a budget.
