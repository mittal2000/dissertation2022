Now, it has an iconic magazine cover to match. For the first time ever, she'll be the cover star of Vogue UK.The June issue marks 100 years of British Vogue, which can only be described as the holy grail of fashion, and features a 10-page spread of the media phenomenon previously known as Kate Middleton. It's shot by British photographer Josh Olins and is the first fashion magazine shoot she's ever posed for.Kate is pictured beautifully and casually in Norfolk, England, where she and her family (including the almost birthday girl Princess Charlotte!), live most of the time. Wearing a Burberry coat and blouse on the cover with a vintage hat, and a striped Petit Bateau t-shirt with minimal makeup in another, she looks natural, comfortable and downright gorgeous.Oh, and did we mention, Kate is so down to earth that one of the pieces she wears is totally affordable? That Petit Bateau red breton striped t-shirt retails for £35, or around $51. For those of us outside of the UK, several similar styles are available on the brand's website. Those two images are on display at London's National Portrait Gallery, where the duchess is a patron. They are included as part of an exhibition on 100 years of British Vogue. In gracing the cover, Kate follows in the footsteps of her husband's late mother, Princess Diana, who starred on the iconic magazine four times.Kate was ""delighted"" to pose for Vogue UK, a ""leading champion of British portraiture since 1916,"" tweeted Kensington Palace.But there's a chance at least one member of the royal family is less than delighted about the whole thing. In 2011, when rumors were swirling that Kate was wanted for an American Vogue cover, E! reported that Queen Elizabeth II would be against the idea.Still, it is British Vogue, and it is a huge year for both the magazine and the royal family as the Queen celebrates turning 90. And, maybe, just maybe, she has come around to the idea over the last five years.Now, if you'll excuse us, we'll be figuring out a way to get our hands on a hard copy, which hits newsstands May 5. "

But on Friday, the 47-year-old shared a tweet saying that life with McNamara was ""happily humbling."" McNamara, a crime writer, died in her sleep at the age of 46 on April 21. Publicists for both McNamara and Oswalt confirmed the news, though no cause of death was noted. Oswalt’s publicist, Kevin McLaughlin, told The Associated Press that her death “was a complete shock to her family and friends, who loved her dearly.”McNamara married Oswalt in 2005, and the couple welcomed their daughter Alice in 2009.

The miffed customer further notes that hot Starbucks beverages typically cost less than cold ones, even though they contain more coffee because of the lack of ice.Among the accusations hurled at the coffee conglomerate are fraud, negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment.Pincus expresses her intent to represent everyone who ever purchased a cold drink from the coffee chain over the last 10 years.A Starbucks spokesperson believes the suit is ""without merit,"" however.""Our customers understand and expect that ice is an essential component of any 'iced' beverage,” the spokesperson told The Huffington Post in an email, adding that the company would remake any beverage if a customer is unsatisfied.This story has been updated to include a statement from Starbucks."

And now, you're on the cusp of becoming a teenager as a 12-year-old. It blows my mind how fast time has flown by, and I wish I could relive and savor each moment of your childhood just once more. The dating years are fast approaching (even though I'd like to think they are light years away) which means you're growing up. Most of your girlfriends in school are at that age, just like you, where boys will pass you secret notes and ask you to the school dance. You'll forget to mention boys to me for the entire school year in fear that you'll get in trouble for dating. But, I want you to know you never have to hide anything from me.I'm not ready for you to grow up just yet, but I know that there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. I want to make sure you enter the world feeling confident in who you are, what you stand for, what you should accept into your life, and most importantly, what you deserve. The boys will come knocking because you are so beautiful inside and out. You radiate joy, which is insatiably attractive and will make all the boys fall in love with you. You're hilariously funny, charismatic, a beautiful artist, and a brave young woman. Don't ever forget it.But please remember these 8 key tips when it comes to dating:1. Never pick a boy who doesn't notice your inward beauty first. The perfect boy will look deep into your heart and tell you that he finds you funny or that you're a beautiful artist first and beautiful outwardly second. This world is full of superficial dating where teens and even men and women date because of mere looks. But looks fade, sweetie. Don't accept anything less than a boy who appreciates your inner beauty. 2. Never let a boy objectify you. When it comes to looks and compliments, believe me, boys can definitely be flattering. It feels uplifting and exciting when a boy tells you that you're beautiful, but remember, true beauty isn't just skin-deep. The perfect boy will never call you demeaning words that objectify you. In case you ever doubt yourself, I want you to know that you are beautiful, angelic, spirited, and intelligent, and anything less than a boy who appreciates that isn't worth your time. 3. Never fall for a boy just because he's good-looking. I want you to know that even the most handsome boys can be the wrong fit. Instead, I want you to look for integrity. If you settle for anything less than honorable character it will lead to heartache and disappointment. 4. Never tolerate being called names. It'll break your spirit, and over time, you'll actually start to believe it. Instead, I want you to be brave enough to walk away from anyone who is making you feel like anything less than a beautiful, bright young woman. You deserve more; you deserve better. The songs on the radio demeaning girls are wrong, and I never want you to do anything you aren't entirely comfortable with just to look cool. 5. Never give in to peer pressure. It takes courage to strike out on your own instead of following the crowd. Your uniqueness makes you stand out from the crowd naturally. Embrace it. That's something that may take time for you to realize, but I promise you that you were born to shine and to influence the world, and this begins with the relationships you develop and the woman you become as a teenager. Be the girl that sets the standard for other girls. 6. Never tolerate abuse. This is one of the most important things I always want you to remember. Abuse shows up in endless forms, from name-calling, controlling behavior, physical harm, and at times, it may be more subtle psychological and emotional abuse, which is harder to recognize. If I ever tell you that I believe someone is hurting you, believe me then instead of coming to the painful realization later, after the wounds have left their mark. I hope we never have to face a situation like this, but in a world full of dating, relationships, and abuse statistics on the rise, it's a possibility -- one that I hope you never have to face. 7. Never settle for an ""I'm sorry"" if a boy ever puts his hands on you. You are forgiving in nature, so this may not be easy, but forgiving still means you can walk away. Nowadays, girls put up with groping, pushing, and even demeaning soul- crushing words like ""bitch"" like it's acceptable or normal. It's not okay. Nobody deserves this treatment, especially you.8. Never let a boy cheat on you. Cheating has become so common that people don't realize what a betrayal it really is. It's popular for boys to be ""players."" But understand that you are not a ""plaything"" to be used and tossed aside just to bolster a boy's reputation or popularity. Go find another ""game"" where you end up the winner because you don't deserve to be cheated on -- ever. Trust me, I've dealt with all of these things in my past, which is why I'm telling you now so you set your standards sky high because you deserve to be treated like a queen. Here's the most painful lesson of all: The ""perfect boy"" doesn't really exist. All boys -- all people, in fact -- have their quirks and shortcomings. But you'll know when you've found the ""right"" boy because he will make your soul soar, not sink.

11,POLITICS,John Kasich Confronted Over GOP’s Anti-Gay Stance During San Francisco Town Hall,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kasich-gay-rights_us_5723e577e4b01a5ebde5bc23,Things got heated when the Republican presidential candidate was pressed on his party's history of discrimination.,2016-04-30,A questioner challenged Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) on his party's stance on gay rights during a town hall in San Francisco. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5723eb37220000360025507c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO -- GOP presidential hopeful John Kasich on Friday distanced himself from discriminatory laws passed recently by some states during a heated exchange with a man who challenged the Republican Party's stance on gay rights.During a town hall-style event hosted by the Commonwealth Club of California, a 62-year-old San Francisco resident who said he came out to his parents at age 19 asked Kasich if he believes people are born gay.""Gay people are human beings and not a lifestyle choice,"" said the questioner. “I don’t believe in discrimination,"" Kasich said. ""I think there is a balance, however, between discrimination and people’s religious liberties. But I think we should just try to like, take a chill pill, relax and try to get along with one another a little bit better instead of trying to write some law to solve a problem that doesn't quite frankly exist in big enough numbers to justify more lawmaking.""Kasich was apparently referring to so-called religious freedom laws passed in several states in recent years. These measures, like one signed into law in Mississippi this month, allow businesses to refuse to provide services to lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people on religious grounds.The questioner continued to press Kasich, pointing out that the GOP opposes marriage equality in its party platform.“I haven’t read that thing lately,” Kasich said. “The Republican Party is my vehicle, not my master. I have a right to define the Republican Party. … I believe in traditional marriage. I just went to a gay wedding.”""Do you feel people are born gay?"" the questioner asked again. ""You know Sir, probably,"" the governor replied. ""I don't know how it all works. Are they? In all probability they are. Okay?"" The back-and-forth continued, with the questioner pointing to discriminatory laws like Mississippi's that were passed by GOP legislatures and signed into law by Republican governors. “They are not me,” Kasich said.Instead of trying to legislate these issues, Kasich said, people should learn to ""tolerate each other's individual beliefs."" If a photographer refuses to work at a gay wedding, Kasich said, the couple should find a new photographer. And if a bakery has a potential customer who is gay, they should ""sell the cake."" ""We cannot be pushing each other’s buttons,"" he said.""I'm not going to sign any laws in Ohio that [are] going to create discrimination against anybody,"" he continued. ""I don't see any reason to hurt you or discriminate against you or make you feel bad or make you feel like a second-class citizen. I don't think that's right."" Kasich, who is more moderate on gay rights than many Republicans, has previously hedged on LGBT issues. He has repeatedly said that he does not personally believe in gay marriage, but as president wouldn't fight the Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Though he said he would probably would not have signed anti-LGBT bills like North Carolina's HB 2, his advice to people facing discrimination is to ""get over it."" ""John Kasich can’t have it both ways,"" said Democratic National Committee spokesman T.J. Helmstetter after the governor's ""get over it"" comments aired on CNN earlier this month. ""Either you're for discrimination, or you're against it."""

That’s a lot of money -- and a record for this point in the race. But it’s only about $100 million more than was spent in the 2008 election, after adjusting for inflation.Super PACs are doing their part to shatter records, spending significantly more than in 2012. But spending by the candidates themselves, despite an unwieldy Republican field that numbered 17 at its peak, is in no way record-breaking.Outside groups affiliated with -- or aligned against -- a particular candidate had spent $383 million. Other super PACs and dark money nonprofits that weren’t specifically aligned with a candidate, but were engaged in the race, had spent approximately $23 million. In total, these groups had spent $406 million. Almost all of this was spent in Republican primaries.The spending by super PACs is significantly higher than in 2012 -- the first election where the unlimited money groups popped up as allied arms of campaigns. Super PACs, mostly those aligned with candidates, and an array of (mostly conservative) dark money groups combined to spend $124 million in the 2012 cycle, adjusted for inflation.Super PACs were born from the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and a lower court ruling that followed it. These groups are political committees that can raise unlimited contributions from corporations, labor unions or billionaires, so long as they don’t coordinate their spending with the candidates they support.This ban on coordination was stretched to its limits in the 2016 primaries, when candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal pretended not to be candidates so that they could raise unlimited funds for super PACs without illegally coordinating. This generated a fundraising surge for super PACs (and other groups). Bush raised more than $100 million for his Right to Rise USA super PAC -- more than any candidate committee has raised or spent to date on the Republican side.The reliance on super PACs by the Republican field stunted fundraising and spending by candidates' actual campaigns. In fact, super PACs engaged in the race have spent $346 million -- more than the candidates themselves.Spending by the actual campaigns of the 17 Republican candidates was $293 million. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) led a tiny field that has spent $328 million. Overall, candidates in both parties have spent a combined $624 million.This sounds like a lot of money, but it’s less than the inflation-adjusted $894 million that candidates spent in 2008. Spending by candidates of both parties in the 2016 campaign has been less than in 2008.Spending By Presidential Campaigns Through March 31 (2008-2016)In the 2008 campaign, Clinton, then-Sen. Barack Obama and ex-Sen. John Edwards led a pack of Democratic candidates that spent $522 million in inflation-adjusted dollars through the end of March. The Republican field, led by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), spent $371 million, adjusted for inflation.Nearly all numbers for candidates have declined in 2016 from 2008. Sanders is the biggest 2016 spender on the Democratic side through March, with $168 million. Back in 2008, Obama had spent an inflation-adjusted $212 million. This election, the third-biggest spender among Democrats was former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, with a little more than $6 million. In 2008, Edwards spent an inflation-adjusted $63 million. Three other Democratic candidates -- Bill Richardson, Joe Biden and Chris Dodd -- spent in the eight figures.For the GOP in 2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is the top spender, with $70 million. That’s short of what each of the three leading Republican candidates spent over the same period in 2008, when Romney, McCain and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani spent an inflation-adjusted $124 million, $79 million and $72 million respectively. This cycle's record super PAC spending may decline in the general election, with Donald Trump the most likely Republican nominee. Most of the party’s biggest donors either previously funded super PACs for candidates other than Trump, or are contributing to anti-Trump super PACs like Our Principles PAC. Trump has publicly disavowed super PACs that have formed to support him and has attacked the party’s elite donor class.The billionaire Koch brothers, the largest source of financial power in the Republican Party, have expressed displeasure with Trump. Charles Koch told ABC News that his political organization and the hundreds of millions of dollars it typically spends on elections may sit out this presidential race.These developments show that a Trump nomination may prevent the 2016 general election campaign from costing more than the $2 billion-plus spent in 2012.

The responses they got won’t shock you.,2016-04-30,Rain could not stop the Sunlight Foundation staff members from soliciting partygoers for their swag bags -- and making a political point in the process.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57251f541300002a003801cc.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Sunlight Foundation decided to be the skunk at Washington, D.C.’s party.Staff from the political transparency nonprofit asked the journalists, celebrities and Beltway power brokers leaving a White House Correspondents Dinner party at the St. Regis Hotel on Friday night if they would donate the pricy swag bags doled out at the party as charity to the organization. (The dinner itself is on Saturday evening, but parties and other events associated with it take place all weekend.)The nonpartisan group caught many of the interactions on camera.The six-and-a-half minutes of footage the foundation released on Saturday don't flatter the members of the media, entertainment and political elite attending the lavish affair.Donations were not exactly forthcoming. Many people can be seen studiously ignoring the Sunlight staffers as if they were panhandlers.Keegan-Michael Key, the star of the forthcoming film “Keanu” and the former Comedy Central show “Key & Peele,” claimed he could not hear them properly.When one of the staff members asked MSNBC chief legal correspondent Ari Melber if he would donate his bag, Melber responded, “No, but I do love the Sunlight Foundation.” At least one journalist thought the gimmick was in poor taste.“Don’t make us look bad because we’re going to a party,” said CNN's senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta.As the evening progressed, the outlook for donations grew grimmer -- and so did the music in the background of the Sunlight Foundation’s video.Luckily, relief arrived in the form of The Huffington Post’s Sam Stein. Stein donated at least two items from his bag.“I support this mission, whatever it is,” Stein said.Then the floodgates opened. A series of people appeared on screen handing over the expensive goody bags of sponsors' luxury products distributed at the party.Melissa Yeager, a senior staff writer for the Sunlight Foundation who was on hand outside the St. Regis, said the group’s staffers had collected a total of five bags. They asked dozens of people from 7 to 9 p.m. “We were actually pretty excited about” the haul, Yeager said.The Sunlight Foundation has not yet decided how it will convert the bags into cash for the organization. One possibility is that they will auction the bags off, Yeager said.The nonprofit had conceived of the activity partly as an “innovative fundraiser"" in the hopes of capitalizing on journalists’ appreciation for their work, Yeager said. But the primary goal of the stunt was to “draw attention to how influence can work in Washington,” she said. While it might not be strictly unethical for reporters to accept the expensive goody bags distributed at the party, Yeager noted they do edge into a gray area that should raise questions.“If you are reporting on issues of influence, I think it’s good to be aware of how influence can be a force in your life as well,” she concluded.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Sunlight Foundation operates OpenSecrets.org. That website is run by the Center for Responsive Politics."
15,BUSINESS,The Verizon Strike Is About More Than Dollars And Cents,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/verizon-strike_us_5723e56ae4b0b49df6ab67e5,"The real fight is over union jobs, period.",2016-04-30,Hundreds of Verizon workers strike outside of the telecommunications company's Brooklyn offices on April 13 in New York City.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5723e65e220000290025507b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Thursday morning, Eddie Blackburn, a Verizon technician in Rhode Island, logged on to Facebook to send his colleagues a message. They were scheduled to lose their Verizon health coverage soon while out on strike. Blackburn urged his friends not to buckle and cross the picket line.""I would personally rather die on that line than sell out my union, and friends I have broke bread with, shared birthdays and family events with, laughed and cried together,"" Blackburn wrote in a Facebook post. ""I have worked with some of you for almost 20 years. Crossing the line for me is not an option, I ask the same from you.""Verizon technicians and customer service reps on the company's wireline phone business walked off the job more than two weeks ago. By modern U.S. standards, the work stoppage is massive -- some 37,000 workers, stretching from the Northeast through the mid-Atlantic. The latest round of talks failed to broker a deal, and both sides are girded for a protracted battle. At this point, the fight is over much more than wages and benefits.As Blackburn put it to The Huffington Post, ""They want to get out from underneath the unionized workforce.""On Thursday, Verizon offered what it deemed a ""best and final offer,"" which was rejected by the unions representing the workers, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. That offer included a 7.5 percent pay hike over the course of the contract -- a one percent bump over what was previously offered -- along with 401k and pension contributions, and health coverage that was only moderately more expensive than the current plan, according to Verizon, which owns AOL, The Huffington Post's parent company. But those aren't the real sticking points. According to Bob Master, political director at CWA, Verizon is willing to extend layoff protections to workers, but only if it can cut into seniority protections, and offer incentives that could help the company nudge unionized workers off the job. ""They are trying to get what they label as 'flexibility,' which undermines our job security and the fairness with which workers are treated,"" Master said. ""The attitude is, 'We want to do with workers whatever we want.'… It's ideological."" Rich Young, a Verizon spokesman, said the company wants the ability to offer retirement incentives for workers in areas where they are overstaffed, which they would need the unions to agree to. He said the packages they have in mind would provide $50,000 or more to workers to voluntarily leave the company. He said the unions don't want to agree to that because it could shrink the union workforce.""That's what it's about,"" Young said. ""We're not in the business of making sure the unions stay in business. We're in the business of keeping solid jobs for our employees and helping this wireline unit to succeed.""It's not that we're opposed to unions,"" he added. ""This is a business that has faced challenges.""Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of labor research at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the fight isn't simply about ""what's cheaper"" for the company.""In the case of Verizon, I would say it is just as much about union avoidance,"" Bronfenbrenner said. She noted that Verizon has fought back hard against CWA's efforts to unionize employees on Verizon's wireless side, which is non-union and growing. The current work stoppage marks the largest U.S. strike since the last time Verizon workers walked off the job, in 2011. Union membership in the U.S. is hovering near an all-time low of 6.7 percent in the private sector, compared to a post-war high above 30 percent. Strikes are both rarer and riskier than they used to be, given the deteriorated leverage of organized labor. Last year, there were just 12 major strikes, involving 47,000 workers. Two decades earlier, there were 31 of them, involving 192,000 workers.Julius Getman, a labor law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the current strike will become more difficult for workers as it drags on, and that they need to rally community support if they hope to prevail. Such a large-scale strike being rare these days, their success or failure in the fight will send a strong message, he said. ""The state of the labor movement is significantly dependent on the state of the strike weapon,"" Getman said. Given the long-term implications of the wireline workers' contract, the unions have dug in hard. The Verizon employees who are on strike will lose their company-sponsored health coverage on Sunday, the first of May. The unions say they have contingency plans in place. According to Master, CWA is asking members to postpone elective treatments, and the union will cover out-of-pocket costs for any care that's needed. Workers who have chronic conditions will be going on COBRA plans while their Verizon coverage is lapsed. According to Young, representatives from the company and the unions had met during the day on Friday. The company was awaiting another proposal from the unions as of late afternoon, he said. On Friday the company said it was deploying thousands more replacement workers to fill in for those on strike. Away from the bargaining table, the public fight continues. The unions have orchestrated picket lines at Verizon Wireless stores in a number of cities, and the strike has even spilled over into the presidential primary. Striking workers have been visited on the picket line by both Democratic presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Young said that ""well over a thousand"" workers had crossed the picket line to return to work, a number he said the company expects to grow.Verizon employee Dan Hylton, of Roanoke, Virginia, said other unions have pledged to help the striking workers financially if need be. He has worked for Verizon for more than 20 years, and he has been through what he said were six different strikes. His mother was a longtime employee, too. He said he recalls ""a long string of peanut butter sandwiches one summer"" when he was a child and his mother walked off the job. ""The company thinks taking away benefits will make people cross the line,"" Hylton said. ""But no one has anything to worry about.""Given the national attention, Hylton said he believes the strike has implications far beyond Verizon. ""It's not just about us,"" he said. ""It's about the middle-class, union jobs going forward that this sets a benchmark for."""

In this edition, we speak with Dr. Muhammad Sahimi about Saudi Arabia's new plan to diversify its economy.Saudi Arabia launched an ambitious 14-year strategy to reshape its economy amid plummeting global oil prices on Monday, the same day the International Monetary Fund revealed grim prospects for Middle Eastern oil exporters.Titled ""Vision 2030,"" the blueprint seeks to increase Saudi Arabia's non-oil revenue from $43.6 billion in 2015 to $267 billion by 2030. The plan offered few specific details on how this would be achieved, Reuters observed.The strategy outlines three key pillars: a ""vibrant society,"" ""thriving economy"" and ""ambitious nation."" It aims to transform Saudi Arabia's national oil company, Saudi Aramco -- estimated to be worth as much as $2.5 trillion -- into a ""global industrial conglomerate.""In its 2016 Middle East and Central Asia report, the IMF warned that oil exporters are ""facing another year of heavily reduced oil export revenues, and require ongoing fiscal consolidation and reforms to cope with these losses and to diversify their economies away from oil.""Weaning itself from its oil dependency may prove to be an exceptionally challenging task for Saudi Arabia. With one-quarter of all known oil reserves, it is the world's largest crude oil exporter and has long dominated the market. But the country's net export surplus has decreased by 51.8 percent since 2011, according to data from World's Top Exports. Experts project that the slow growth will continue.In a televised interview with Al Arabiya on Monday, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the country's economy and announced the Cabinet-approved Vision 2030 blueprint, admitted his nation has an ""addiction to oil.""""That issue is serious. It disrupted the development of many sectors in the past years,"" he said. ""Oil should be treated as an investment, nothing more, nothing less.""The strategy, which the prince described as ""ambitious yet achievable,"" will include selling up to 5 percent of Aramco to the public market to raise hundreds of billions of dollars that will be used in part for an enormous global investment fund.The process of Aramco's partial privatization will represent the largest initial public offering ""in the history of the globe,"" he noted. The WorldPost spoke to Dr. Muhammad Sahimi, an expert in Middle Eastern oil politics and a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Southern California, about Saudi Arabia's economic reform plan.This week, Saudi Arabia launched a set of reforms to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. What are the main reasons the country's leaders are launching Vision 2030 right now? The main reason seems to be that the world is moving away from fossil fuels. Climate change is worsening; more and more people are convinced that if the world does not move away from fossil fuels, we will experience a lot of destruction of nature, vast droughts and eventually, a huge migration of people from drought-stricken areas toward more fertile lands, wreaking havoc on all aspects of life.Moving away from fossil fuels means that those nations that rely on oil income must also move away from an oil-dominant economy toward a diversified one.At the same time, though, even if fossil fuels continue to play a major role in meeting our energy needs, fracking and production of fossil fuels from such reservoirs have moved Western powers, including the United States, toward energy self-sufficiency. Thus, as oil imports from the Persian Gulf area and other oil-exporting countries decline, these nations must also diversify their economy to rely less on selling oil.The plan sets an ambitious goal to increase the country's non-oil revenues from about $43.6 billion in 2015 to $267 billion by 2030. What does Saudi Arabia need to do in order to wean itself off its ""addiction"" to oil?First and foremost, Saudi Arabia needs the technological base and the manpower for the alternative industries that it supposedly wants to develop. This does not currently exist to a large extent in Saudi Arabia, and I doubt that it can be developed over the next decade or so.Despite having a major oil industry for many decades, many sectors of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry are still dependent on foreign expertise, manpower, etc. So, how is the country going to develop so rapidly the required technological base in a non-oil sector?At the same time, Saudi Arabia has been a sort of welfare state in which the government has kept the population under control and more or less content with huge handouts. How is the culture going to change so rapidly without causing political instability?One also needs to have a diversification plan that not only addresses the needs of the nation and its future, but that also puts the nation in a position to be able to export technologically significant products.And how realistic is the plan's goal?I do not believe it is realistic, for the reasons that I outlined above. Even under the best circumstances, increasing the non-oil revenues by a factor of over 6 in only 14 years is difficult -- let alone in a nation like Saudi Arabia that is still dependent on foreign expertise for its oil industry and that also faces a lot of dissatisfaction among the population.Add to this the facts that Saudi Arabia is in one of the most turbulent regions in the world, that it has major commitments to its allies in the region (Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, etc.), that it spends lavishly on buying weapons, that it spends huge sums in religious schools to advocate Wahhabism, and that it has demonstrated utter incompetence in its war in Yemen. I highly doubt that the plan will go forward as intended.How realistic and wise do you rate the other economic proposals in the plan, like creating a domestic defense industry?Consider Iran in the same region. Since the end of its war with Iraq in 1988, Iran has tried to develop its own arms industry. Except for missiles and a few other related weapons, Iran has not succeeded to produce weapons that can compete in the international arena.Of course, Iran has been under a Western military embargo, but Iran has advantages that Saudi Arabia does not: It has a dynamic and young population of nearly 80 million, extremely well-connected with the outside world and highly educated and innovative.So, unless Western weapon makers agree to transfer their technology to Saudi Arabia and also supply the expertise and manpower there so that the Saudi government can set up a domestic weapon industry, I doubt that it can actually implement the plan.Were there any surprises in the plan's social and educational reform proposals? The main surprise to me its timing. Why now? What has changed? At the same time, the Saudi political system acquires its legitimacy by making a pact with the religious authorities of the nation, who advocate “pure” and backward-looking interpretations of Islamic teachings -- which explains why the society is so conservative.So, how can a major plan such as this be implemented without any fundamental change in the cultural fabric of society? And, if such changes do occur, what would happen to the pact between the government and the Wahhabi religious authorities? Will that not bring political instability?Remember that the Shah of Iran tried to do the same in the 1970s, and the Shah’s regime was fully supported by the West. Yet poor planning, unrealistic ambitions, and the lack of infrastructure, a technological base and manpower not only derailed the plans, but also contributed significantly to starting the 1979 Revolution.How did ordinary Saudis react to the plan? What about the Saudi religious establishment?That remains to be seen.What are the risks for Saudi Arabia if it fails to implement the plan? Saudi Arabia is already in deep trouble. It has supported Islamic fundamentalism for decades, it has been involved deeply in the wars in Syria and Iraq, it started an illegal war in Yemen that was not even necessary for its true national interests and national security. And it has been obsessed with Iran in the region, while it has also contributed significantly to the drop in the price of oil by flooding the market with overproduction just to hurt Iran.So, if deep changes envisioned by the plan do not materialize, or even if they do materialize but cause major upheaval in the society (which I believe they will), we will have a bloody revolution with consequences that will be far-reaching, not only for Saudi Arabia itself, but for the entire region and beyond.This interview has been edited for clarity.Also on HuffPost:This Congressman Doesn't Buy Obama's Excuses For Supporting Saudi Arabia In YemenDon't Give Obama A Free Pass When It Comes To Saudi Aggression"

21,POLITICS,This 28-Year-Old Is Running For Congress To Try To Destroy U.S.-Saudi Relations,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alex-beinstein-saudi-arabia-congress_us_572257f3e4b01a5ebde4f58e,"Barack Obama, Paul Ryan and others are protecting the kingdom for their own financial gain, Republican hopeful Alex Beinstein alleges.",2016-04-30,Alex Beinstein likes historic American foreign policy practitioners like Henry Kissinger. But he's not a fan of the historic U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5723b46c1900002d0056cafe.jpeg?ops=crop_9_709_2429_2014%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Earlier this month, a political newcomer named Alex Beinstein picked up enough delegates to pose a credible primary challenge to three-term congressman Rep. Scott Tipton (R-Colo.).That means voters in Colorado’s 3rd district will have a new name to consider when they gather on June 28 to choose their Republican standard-bearer — along with a lot of new ideas.Beinstein, a 28-year-old libertarian, wants to use the district’s House seat to place Saudi Arabia on the list of state sponsors of terror. He believes the longtime U.S. partner is responsible for the 9/11 attacks and the growth of violent extremist groups, including the self-described Islamic State, in Syria.The only reason Saudi leaders haven’t been held accountable yet, Beinstein says, is because Saudi money has corrupted everyone from President Barack Obama and CNN’s Anderson Cooper to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Fox News leadership. He told The Huffington Post that Bill Gates, Apple Inc., The Plaza Hotel in New York and the Four Seasons hotel chain are among other alleged lackeys of the kingdom. (Let’s not even get started on Hillary Clinton.)The benefits of U.S.-Saudi ties — including intelligence-sharing that has prevented terror attacks on American planes, synagogues and other targets, as well as the value of having a Muslim partner in the war on Islamist terror — are all “a mirage,” according to Beinstein.Even the Saudis’ tacit tolerance of Israel, a product of the two countries’ shared anxiety about Iran, can be sacrificed, he argues. “I don’t think anyone in Israel really trusts Saudi Arabia … [and while] America is Israel’s godfather, it doesn’t mean Israel does everything right.”There would be a cost to cutting economic ties with the kingdom, Beinstein acknowledges. But he says history proves that business relationships shouldn’t supersede the imperative to do what’s right — after all, American businesses once worked with Nazi Germany, and that didn’t stop the U.S. from ultimately moving against Hitler.“Eventually, the right thing has to prevail,” Beinstein said. “There’s something in the Scriptures that says you can serve God and you can serve money, but you can’t serve both masters at the same time.”The young candidate says he will fund his own campaign with the donations he hopes to receive in the weeks ahead. His family has largely funded and staffed his effort so far. Beinstein's success, particularly in beating the minimum threshold he needed to get on the primary ballot, is a striking example of how bashing U.S.-Saudi relations is becoming increasingly popular around the country.This is happening as high-profile critiques of Saudi Arabia have become more common in Washington, despite the kingdom's investment in forging relationships here. Echoing Obama -- whose administration privately refers to Washington's Massachusetts Avenue, home to many foreign-funded research institutions, as ""Arab-occupied territory"" -- Beinstein spoke of ""Saudi tentacles all around D.C."" He is, of course, otherwise staunchly opposed to the president.Beinstein believes the kingdom's alleged influence should be a top concern for the residents of his sprawling, mostly rural Colorado district. ""Almost anyone here will take a flight, or go to the mall. ... or to a [Denver] Broncos game,"" he said. In those moments, he argues, Coloradans might become victims of international terror -- a threat he traces directly to Saudi Arabia.He points specifically to theories about the ""28 pages,"" a classified portion of a congressional inquiry into 9/11 that some say reveals ties between the attackers and the Saudi government. Beinstein also cites widely criticized articles by journalist Seymour Hersh alleging that the Saudis helped establish terror organizations in Syria and protect Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. The Saudis have long retorted that they are strong U.S. partners against al Qaeda and other violent extremist groups, and would like to see the pages released to prove their innocence. Reached for comment Friday, the kingdom's representatives in the U.S. pointed to a recent statement by the chair and vice chair of the 9/11 Commission, who reiterated that they had found no evidence, including the 28 pages, linking the Saudi government or senior Saudi officials to al Qaeda.Beinstein, who can casually drop the names of top Saudi lobbyists in Washington -- DLA Piper, former Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.) -- believes his opponent, Tipton, is one of the politicians compromised by ties to the kingdom. As evidence, he says the congressman has failed to publicly condemn Saudi Arabia and has ties to local oil, gas and coal companies.""His defense is, 'I don't talk about Saudi Arabia because I'm not on committees' [relating to it],"" Beinstein told HuffPost. ""He felt compelled to weigh in on Syrian refugees. There's equal reason to comment on Saudi Arabia.""Tipton's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Beinstein now compares his long odds to those faced by Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) in 2014. Brat, a political outsider, wrested the Republican nomination for his district from then-House Majority Leader and rising star Eric Cantor that year.A University of Chicago graduate who studied history and interviewed big names in politics for years on his own radio show, Beinstein says voters are unlikely to know as much about the kingdom as he does. But he believes they'll readily agree with him that sitting lawmakers like Tipton are deceptive about their ties to the Saudis.""I've met a lot of voters sick of both parties and entrenched interests ... they look at Obama and Paul Ryan having the same position on Saudi Arabia,"" he said. ""You don't have a lot of lawmakers honest with their constituents about it.""There's ""a notion that voters are stupid,"" the candidate continued. ""Voters are generally aware. It would be disingenuous to say they know the details ... but they're generically aware that Saudi Arabia often acts adverse to our interests.""Beinstein traces his own fixation on the kingdom to May 2015, when he first read journalist Gerald Posner's Secrets of the Kingdom, an indictment of the U.S.-Saudi partnership that explores hundreds of alleged Saudi misdeeds, including ties to 9/11. That was before Beinstein even considered a political career.Now, his ""number one desire"" if he makes it to Congress is to win a seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He would use the perch to implement a three-pronged plan: add Saudi Arabia to the list of state sponsors of terror; subject it to sanctions that would help break economic ties between the kingdom and the U.S.; and freeze the assets of Saudis found to have any links to terror.Beinstein says he expects bipartisan support for that policy. He pointed to Democrats like former Sen. Bob Graham (Fla.) who have raised questions about Saudi Arabia's role in 9/11 and the broader War on Terror.The libertarian Beinstein is not much of a party man in any case: A few years ago, he suggested he was becoming more liberal to a former college mentor. He said he's hoping that independents in his district, 34 percent of the population, will register to vote for him in the Republican primary in June.Though he supports Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for the Republican presidential nomination, Beinstein says real estate developer Donald Trump has ""come closest to calling out what [the Saudis] have done.""Trump has threatened to cut off U.S. purchases of oil from the Saudis until they pledge ground troops to battle ISIS militants and pay for U.S. military protection. He has also endorsed the idea that the Saudis are behind 9/11, aware that war-weary Americans are still questioning why Iraq was a target after the attacks.Questions over U.S.-Saudi relations have gained steam in recent months, in part because of voters' and lawmakers' perception that the kingdom wants the U.S. to be more involved in the Middle East -- notably in Yemen, but also in Syria -- than most Americans would like to be. But foreign policy experts warn that abandoning the kingdom would lead to a host of new regional challenges, and a former top advisor to Obama recently argued that even a critic of the Saudis like the president sees no alternative to some U.S.-Saudi cooperation. Even the lawmakers who are most publicly skeptical of Saudi Arabia have limited proposals for how to change the relationship: A new bill from opponents of the Saudis' actions in Yemen asks for a short-term pause on arms transfers, but stops short of calling for any long-term shift. It's an open question how much Beinstein would challenge this approach if he makes it to Congress. On many foreign policy issues, he is relatively orthodox. He is not keen to reduce the U.S.'s role abroad, and is unhappy with what he sees as Obama's plan to do so. Instead, Beinstein would like to redirect foreign policy efforts by adding Saudi Arabia to the list of U.S. foes abroad, along with Iran, Russia and China. He would also like to increase military spending, particularly for the Navy.To explain why, he referenced former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's analysis of Chinese ambitions and the ongoing tensions between China and U.S. allies in the South China Sea. It was one of many references to famous white men, including presidents Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and George W. Bush, that dotted his brief interview with HuffPost.""We are defenders of freedom,"" Beinstein said. And in his view, partnering with Saudi Arabia is a betrayal of that American value. ""I think we have to stand up for free countries around the world."""

He would use the perch to implement a three-pronged plan: add Saudi Arabia to the list of state sponsors of terror; subject it to sanctions that would help break economic ties between the kingdom and the U.S.; and freeze the assets of Saudis found to have any links to terror.Beinstein says he expects bipartisan support for that policy. He pointed to Democrats like former Sen. Bob Graham (Fla.) who have raised questions about Saudi Arabia's role in 9/11 and the broader War on Terror.The libertarian Beinstein is not much of a party man in any case: A few years ago, he suggested he was becoming more liberal to a former college mentor. He said he's hoping that independents in his district, 34 percent of the population, will register to vote for him in the Republican primary in June.Though he supports Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for the Republican presidential nomination, Beinstein says real estate developer Donald Trump has ""come closest to calling out what [the Saudis] have done.""Trump has threatened to cut off U.S. purchases of oil from the Saudis until they pledge ground troops to battle ISIS militants and pay for U.S. military protection. He has also endorsed the idea that the Saudis are behind 9/11, aware that war-weary Americans are still questioning why Iraq was a target after the attacks.Questions over U.S.-Saudi relations have gained steam in recent months, in part because of voters' and lawmakers' perception that the kingdom wants the U.S. to be more involved in the Middle East -- notably in Yemen, but also in Syria -- than most Americans would like to be. But foreign policy experts warn that abandoning the kingdom would lead to a host of new regional challenges, and a former top advisor to Obama recently argued that even a critic of the Saudis like the president sees no alternative to some U.S.-Saudi cooperation. Even the lawmakers who are most publicly skeptical of Saudi Arabia have limited proposals for how to change the relationship: A new bill from opponents of the Saudis' actions in Yemen asks for a short-term pause on arms transfers, but stops short of calling for any long-term shift. It's an open question how much Beinstein would challenge this approach if he makes it to Congress. On many foreign policy issues, he is relatively orthodox. He is not keen to reduce the U.S.'s role abroad, and is unhappy with what he sees as Obama's plan to do so. Instead, Beinstein would like to redirect foreign policy efforts by adding Saudi Arabia to the list of U.S. foes abroad, along with Iran, Russia and China. He would also like to increase military spending, particularly for the Navy.To explain why, he referenced former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's analysis of Chinese ambitions and the ongoing tensions between China and U.S. allies in the South China Sea. It was one of many references to famous white men, including presidents Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and George W. Bush, that dotted his brief interview with HuffPost.""We are defenders of freedom,"" Beinstein said. And in his view, partnering with Saudi Arabia is a betrayal of that American value. ""I think we have to stand up for free countries around the world."""

He believes the EU is undemocratic in its current form.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5723f44b220000360025507d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- When Greece’s European creditors cut off emergency assistance to the beleaguered country’s banks last summer, bringing its financial system to the brink of collapse, it was only a matter of weeks before the Greek government capitulated to their demands. A band of radical socialist politicians elected to upend the status quo agreed to the most onerous austerity package the country had yet experienced, in exchange for emergency loans it needed to repay mountainous debts to those same official lenders.Greece’s sympathizers around the world called the result a coup d’état -- the result of extortion akin to the “gunboat diplomacy” of the imperial era.Yanis Varoufakis, a progressive economist, who as finance minister had been the most visible face of Greece’s new government and remains one of the country’s highest-profile political figures, resigned his cabinet post under pressure shortly before the deal was signed.After leaving public office, he founded the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025. The goal of the pan-European initiative is to democratize the European Union institutions that enabled the financial blackmail against Greece last summer. Absent such change, DiEm25 argues, the united, peaceful and prosperous post-Cold War Europe will “disintegrate” in no more than a decade’s time.But what exactly is undemocratic about the duly elected governments of the other 18 nations in the euro currency area imposing their will on the duly elected government of Greece? After all, in a democracy, the majority rules.Varoufakis was in Washington on Wednesday to plug his new book about the European debt crisis, And The Weak Suffer What They Must? Europe’s Crisis And America’s Economic Future, so I asked him just that.“Let me remind you that democracy is not the same thing as majoritarianism,” Varoufakis responded. “If the majority decides to have the minority tortured, this is a tyranny of the majority and it has absolutely nothing to do with democracy. Democracy needs to combine majority with due process and with rights.”In Greece's case, the analogy to torture is presumably leveraging Greece’s reliance on the European Central Bank to keep its troubled banks afloat to force it to accept painful economic measures rejected by its voters.To illustrate his point, Varoufakis recounted a story from his first days as finance minister in January 2015. He met with Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup, the powerful council of the individual eurozone nations’ finance ministers.Dijsselbloem, according to Varoufakis, asked Varoufakis what his government’s intentions were for fiscal policy.Varoufakis claims he gave a “very nuanced answer.”“I said, ‘Well, we were elected to challenge that and to change that fiscal policy,’” Varoufakis recalled.In Varoufakis’ mind, even this was a major compromise, since the previous six years of top-down European austerity policies imposed on Greece and other struggling countries on the European periphery had been a “macroeconomic failure greater than that in the history of humankind.”“Nevertheless, let’s sit down and re-think this and find common ground,” Varoufakis remembered telling him. “I thought this was a very moderate thing to say. And it’s the minimum that respect for Greek democracy required.”There is much to support Varoufakis’ economic critique of the eurozone's actions up to that point. The drastic fiscal austerity Germany and other wealthy European nations had demanded from Greece since 2010 in exchange for emergency loans had succeeded in shoring up the German and French banks with Greek debts on their books, but had plunged Greece into a deep depression and state of political crisis. Nearly one in four Greeks is unemployed and its economy has shrunk by roughly one-third since 2008.Worse still, the money is not even enough to allow it to pay off its creditors. The Mediterranean nation has had to return to the bargaining table on multiple occasions to ask for more cash, only to repeat the same never-ending cycle of re-payment, economic contraction, crisis and begging.But Djisselbloem, Varoufakis said, was not having it. He reminded Varoufakis right away who held the poker chips, in a preview of the drama that would occur in late June and early July.“If you insist on re-negotiating the fiscal policy of the previous government, your banks will be closed by the end of the month,” Djisselbloem said, according to Varoufakis.“Now the only way of describing this is as a coup d’état, as the dissolution of every democratic principle that has ever been withheld in Western civilization,” Varoufakis said.Greek voters re-elected Syriza, Varoufakis’ former political party, in September. Only this time, prime minister Alexis Tsipras campaigned on the promise of distributing the burden of austerity as equitably as possible, rather than reversing the approach entirely.And there have been signs in recent months that the Greek government still has some fight left in it. It publicly tussled with the IMF in January over the need to cut pensions to reach its budget targets, rather than raising taxes to do so. It also took the Fund to task in early April for a leaked conversation in which IMF officials implied that only a crisis-inducing credit event would prod Greece to do what is necessary.Meanwhile, news outlets reported on Tuesday that talks between Greece and its international creditors had once again reached a standstill over reforms required to unlock a tranche of loans the country needs to make upcoming debt payments. Greece’s compliance with this round of demands is the price of opening up discussion of debt restructuring, according to the lenders.Varoufakis, however, dismissed the idea that Greece has any say in the matter.“The Greek government surrendered last July. This is why I resigned,” he said. “The Greek government will do anything that creditors ask it to do. They are just waiting for the creditors to decide what they want to impose upon Greece.”Instead, the delays are due to a disagreement between Germany and the IMF, according to the former finance chief. “There is no way they can agree, because the IMF understands that without a sensible debt restructure and a diminution in the primary surplus target, Greece is finished,” Varoufakis said.In fact, while Greece's ongoing influence is a matter of debate, the dispute between the IMF and Germany is no secret. The IMF -- along with its largest shareholder, the United States -- insists that Germany grant Greece debt relief and lower the budget targets it must meet, in order for Greece to regain its financial independence. Germany remains resistant to the idea.The Greek prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Varoufakis’ characterization.Varoufakis argued that German officials had made debt relief politically impossible for themselves by falsely selling the original loans to Greece as a bailout for the Greek people, rather than as a bailout of the German and French banks, which stood to collapse if Greece could not pay up. Now the German parliament, with the backing of a bitter, tax-paying public, has no interest in cutting Greece any additional slack.“The creditors are now in a trap of their own making,” he concluded. “And Greece is fading into oblivion and into its awful, debt-deflationary crisis, while waiting for Washington, D.C., and Berlin to decide what to do.”"

University of Houston graduate student Zachary Turpin found the work while browsing a digitized database of 19th-century newspapers, and the Walt Whitman Quarterly Review published the 126-page guide online last Saturday.Outlets from the Times to Time Magazine, Atlas Obscura and BoingBoing write that the guide suggests Whitman was into a Paleo diet. They suggest that his nutritional recommendations are in line with the eating trend that supposedly mimics what our Paleolithic ancestors ate. (Though critics note the Paleo diet isn’t exactly historically accurate.)That conclusion comes from the fact that Whitman apparently really liked meat. Like, really liked meat. “Let the main part of the diet be meat, to the exclusion of all else,” he wrote. And in another section, he recommended that people in “northern and eastern” regions subsist on “an almost exclusive meat diet.” (He noted that he didn't feel qualified to provide advice for people in warmer regions.)But contrary to popular belief, Paleo diets aren’t supposed to be all-meat all the time. While Paleo eaters eschew grains, dairy and processed foods, vegetables are a crucial part of the diet -- you know, to provide vitamins and such. Paleo eaters also supplement their diets with nuts and fruit.And while avoiding grains is a major tenet of eating Paleo, Whitman consistently recommends wheat-based foods for the small portion of his ideal diet that’s not meat. In his view, a “hearty man” would subsist on a “simple diet of rare-cooked beef, seasoned with a little salt, and accompanied with stale bread or sea-biscuit,” which suggests that a hearty man would have a hearty case of scurvy. (It’s also unclear why he wants the bread to be stale.)He was also convinced that spices were bad for you, which is not only not in line with Paleo philosophy, it’s also patently untrue.But while the poet’s nutritional advice was a little… off, some of his other health tips still ring true today. He emphasizes the importance of comfortable shoes, fresh air and getting good sleep, and warns against spending too much time sitting down or stressing yourself out with worry. We’re with you on those things, Walt."

Instead of binging on wild adventures--bungee jumping, big-game hunting, flings with Bieber-aged men-- Kayt became a play-it-safe suburbanite, which is not how she sees herself. In her youth, she was the kid who'd climb the highest tree and accept the biggest dare. As an adult, she swam with sharks and trekked through Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. For Dirty Minds, her book on sex and neurobiology, she experienced an orgasm while undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging scan (no, she doesn't have a radiology fetish-- she volunteered for a study at Rutgers University).Then came middle age. Kayt endured a difficult divorce, tackled new responsibilities as a single mom, and found less time for excitement. She became, she says, ""more of a spectator than a participant in life."" And it bothered her.So Kayt, being a top-notch science writer, conducted research on her fading fearlessness. She investigated the four key factors that affect our willingness to take risks, from gender to genetics (a specific gene has been linked to impulsive behavior and novelty-seeking), from age to our brains (as we get older, our frontal cortexes--the part of the brain that controls behavior--become more mature, which can inhibit risk-taking). Kayt shares these findings along with her personal journey in a fascinating new book, The Art of Risk. I met Kayt in 2011 at a writer's conference in Dublin and I recently asked her to share her biggest, most beneficial lessons.Lesson #1: Small risks are as important as big risks. We often think risk involves frightening experiences, like skydiving or attending a Trump rally. But even tiny risks can be valuable. ""I try not to immediately say no to new experiences- whether it's tasting some weird food or trying Sudoku,"" says Kayt. ""These are all little things but they can keep your brain supple and help you learn--and bring a big sense of accomplishment and wonder.""Lesson #2: Successful risk takers are careful planners. When Kayt interviewed big-time risk takers-- from a BASE jumper to a sex worker to an Army Special Forces operator--they all said the same thing: ""I don't take risks."" But when she suggested that parachuting from cliffs or making underwater incursions into enemy territory IS a bit risky, they'd say, ""Well, okay, but I don't take unnecessary risks."" And that's a key point: Successful risk takers are thoughtful and prepared, says Russ Poldrack, a researcher who studies decision making at the University of Texas at Austin. Conversely, dysfunctional risk takers only look at immediate outcomes. Think of it this way: Space travel is dangerous, but NASA plans for nearly every scenario. They don't impulsively shoot astronauts into space and say, ""Wait--did someone pack the Tang?""Lesson #3: Self-awareness leads to better decisions. ""Know your default response to risky situations,"" says Kayt. ""Are you impulsive? Do you drag your feet? Are you anxious? Understand how factors like your social group, your stress level, and your emotions can influence the way you approach risk."" Let's say you're an impulsive person and you're about to bet $50 on a horse named Gertrude (because it's the same name as your mother--wow!). Take a step back and ask, does this horse have other worthwhile attributes? Should I consider other horses? Or, if you know you're going to bet regardless, bet $5 instead of $50. ""It's all about being thoughtful, reasoned, and aware,"" says Kayt. And it works: Business leaders who understand their own strengths and weaknesses better managed risk at work, a study of executive leaders found.Lesson #4: Risk-taking adds zest to life.  We're all risk takers. It's what we do. ""Few decisions come with any sort of guaranteed outcome,"" says Kayt. ""There's risk involved in what you eat for breakfast and in accepting a marriage proposal. There's risk in going out into the world. And there's risk in staying home."" Kayt has regained her risk-taking mojo (along with a new husband), but she's less interested in wild Thelma-and-Louise-style risks than in risks that bring her joy. ""Safety is, well, safe,"" says Kayt, ""but will it help me achieve the things I really want for my life?""Ken Budd is the host of 650,000 Hours, a web series launching in 2016.

Not mentioned is the effect such globalization 3.0 is having on the nation state, and the rise of ""region-states""--new forms of government with new and unlimited power.Kenichi Ohmae, writing in Foreign Affairs, first seemed to see this dramatic shift in power almost 20 years ago when he pointed out that:""The nation state has become an unnatural, even dysfunctional, unit for organizing human activity and managing economic endeavor in a borderless world. It represents no genuine, shared community of economic interests; it defines no meaningful flows of economic activity. In fact, it overlooks the true linkages and synergies that exist among often disparate populations by combining important measures of human activity at the wrong level of analysis.""As San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said more recently at the City Innovate Summit: ""Cities today are the engines of the greatest surge in innovation, creativity and problem solving in human history ... and cities that think of themselves as platforms will become stronger, attract better talent and become smarter from the bottom up.""Think about it. Little seems to get done by congresses or parliaments, and the executive leadership is more constrained without their cooperation, without their help. It is no surprise why people seem frustrated, angry and to have lost patience. This is not just an American dilemma.Fortunately, cities across the world are starting to change the focus, deploy technology and prepare our citizens to out innovate, out educate and out build every other community and thus every other nation, every other community, in the world. Technology, particularly the ""Internet of Everything"" (IoE), where everything is connected to almost every other thing, is providing cities and their elected officials with the tools to ensure safer cities, better transportation, health care, energy and water conservation, clean air and environmental services. By installing the broadband necessary for the IoE, cities are also building the platform for innovation.The new broadband infrastructure coupled with Big Data analysis can serve to make government more efficient, more transparent and also encourage individuals and companies to develop innovative products and services.As IBM, a truly global company which launched a ""smart cities initiative"" in the last few years put it: ""As cities grow in both numbers and population, they are taking their place on the world's center stage, with more economic, political and technological power than ever before. Economically, they are becoming the hubs of a globally integrated, services-based society. Politically, they are in the midst of a realignment of power -- with greater influence, but also greater responsibility.""The emphasis cannot rest on successful deployment of technology alone.Indeed, according to the New Cities Foundation, a new independent non-profit with offices in new York, Toronto, Geneva and Paris, art and culture are extremely important ingredients to future cities. This the reason so many cities are establishing ""art and culture districts"" designed to create a critical mass of art galleries, dance clubs, theaters, art cinemas, music venues, and public squares for performances. More often, such places attract restaurants, cafes, and retail shops."" Over the next decade, some $ 250 billion will be invested in the creation of new cultural districts around the globe"" ... ""success is not just getting an arts building or series of buildings out of the ground, it is about ensuring that they are viable and play a central role in their communities.""The reasons why such districts are popping up in cities around the world vary but in most cases they are designed to nurture, retain and attract the talented 21st-century workforce so vital to success and survival in the global knowledge economy.The strength of a nation's economy and as well as their political prowess in the world are inextricably linked. And it is cities , and more precisely regions - not the national government - best positioned to renew and reinvent nations for the new, global, knowledge-based economy.

Not mentioned is the effect such globalization 3.0 is having on the nation state, and the rise of ""region-states""--new forms of government with new and unlimited power.Kenichi Ohmae, writing in Foreign Affairs, first seemed to see this dramatic shift in power almost 20 years ago when he pointed out that:""The nation state has become an unnatural, even dysfunctional, unit for organizing human activity and managing economic endeavor in a borderless world. It represents no genuine, shared community of economic interests; it defines no meaningful flows of economic activity. In fact, it overlooks the true linkages and synergies that exist among often disparate populations by combining important measures of human activity at the wrong level of analysis.""As San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said more recently at the City Innovate Summit: ""Cities today are the engines of the greatest surge in innovation, creativity and problem solving in human history ... and cities that think of themselves as platforms will become stronger, attract better talent and become smarter from the bottom up.""Think about it. Little seems to get done by congresses or parliaments, and the executive leadership is more constrained without their cooperation, without their help. It is no surprise why people seem frustrated, angry and to have lost patience. This is not just an American dilemma.Fortunately, cities across the world are starting to change the focus, deploy technology and prepare our citizens to out innovate, out educate and out build every other community and thus every other nation, every other community, in the world. Technology, particularly the ""Internet of Everything"" (IoE), where everything is connected to almost every other thing, is providing cities and their elected officials with the tools to ensure safer cities, better transportation, health care, energy and water conservation, clean air and environmental services. By installing the broadband necessary for the IoE, cities are also building the platform for innovation.The new broadband infrastructure coupled with Big Data analysis can serve to make government more efficient, more transparent and also encourage individuals and companies to develop innovative products and services.As IBM, a truly global company which launched a ""smart cities initiative"" in the last few years put it: ""As cities grow in both numbers and population, they are taking their place on the world's center stage, with more economic, political and technological power than ever before. Economically, they are becoming the hubs of a globally integrated, services-based society. Politically, they are in the midst of a realignment of power -- with greater influence, but also greater responsibility.""The emphasis cannot rest on successful deployment of technology alone.Indeed, according to the New Cities Foundation, a new independent non-profit with offices in new York, Toronto, Geneva and Paris, art and culture are extremely important ingredients to future cities. This the reason so many cities are establishing ""art and culture districts"" designed to create a critical mass of art galleries, dance clubs, theaters, art cinemas, music venues, and public squares for performances. More often, such places attract restaurants, cafes, and retail shops."" Over the next decade, some $ 250 billion will be invested in the creation of new cultural districts around the globe"" ... ""success is not just getting an arts building or series of buildings out of the ground, it is about ensuring that they are viable and play a central role in their communities.""The reasons why such districts are popping up in cities around the world vary but in most cases they are designed to nurture, retain and attract the talented 21st-century workforce so vital to success and survival in the global knowledge economy.The strength of a nation's economy and as well as their political prowess in the world are inextricably linked. And it is cities , and more precisely regions - not the national government - best positioned to renew and reinvent nations for the new, global, knowledge-based economy. In the wake of globalization, cities need to step up to the plate and develop their Internet economic strategies, their broadband and IoT plans, to insure their community meets the challenge of the new age of Creativity and Innovation."

Yet it is happening right under the noses of six prestigious American universities on their satellite campuses in Qatar. Although this incitement violates a prominent pledge by Qatar's government to the U.S. administration, President Obama gave Qatar's Emir Tamim a free pass on the issue after they met in Riyadh on Thursday. Their one-on-one meeting was on the sidelines of a U.S.-Gulf summit, following which the President signed onto a joint communique that said America ""commended"" the Gulf states for their efforts to combat terrorism. Among these, it praised ""actions by Gulf partners to counter ISIL's hateful ideology and message, and more broadly to counter violent extremism.""Yet there can be no more pivotal component to the Islamic State's hateful ideology than its call to murder infidels.

The Foundation's Housing and Residence Life office reportedly emailed students to inform them that the mosque's Friday sermons would be translated into English ""to ensure that everyone is benefiting."" As for hate preacher Mudassir Ahmed in particular, the Foundation promoted his sermon in advance on social media, posting and reposting a flier with its logo as well as that of Qatar's Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs.That sermon, however, was not the first time incitement was uttered from the Education City Mosque. Last November, less than a week before Michelle Obama visited Doha to address a conference at the Foundation, Saudi preacher Tareq al-Hawas used its pulpit to condemn ""the aggressor Zionists,"" urging God to ""count them in number and kill them completely; do not spare one."" And just this month, a different preacher with a record of glorifying Hamas (including specifically its military wing) called at the campus's mosque for God to ""render victorious our brothers the mujahideen... in every place"" and even to ""guide their shooting.""Such language should not have come as a surprise. Ahmed had delivered similar remarks in a 2013 sermon at Qatar's state-controlled Grand Mosque, where another preacher called just last year for Allah to ""destroy"" Christians, Alawites, Shi'ites and Jews. Also in 2013, Hawas reportedly lamented on air that Hitler had not ""finished off"" the Jews, thus ""relieving humanity"" of them. And in spite of Hawas's 2015 incitement at the Education City Mosque, he was just invited back, delivering additional militaristic remarks there on March 11th, just one week before Ahmed's outrageous appearance.In fact, every Friday preacher at the mosque this March has had a distinguished past record of religious incitement. Omar Abdelkafi, who addressed the mosque on March 25th, is an Egyptian fundamentalist who recently declared that the Charlie Hebdo murders in Paris were ""the sequel to the comedy film of 9/11,"" in which Muslims ""played no part."" He also seems to have instructed pious Muslims not to shake hands with Christians or even walk on the same sidewalk.And on March 4th, the Education City Mosque hosted Mohammed al-Arefe, a prominent hardliner from Saudi Arabia with more followers on Twitter than Beyoncé. In the past, Arefe has reportedly described Shi'ite Muslims as purveyors of ""treachery"" and ""evil,"" and in 2013 as ""non-believers who must be killed"" according to Human Rights Watch. He has allegedly offered tips on wife-beating, called Osama bin Laden a ""sheikh,"" and proclaimed that ""one's devotion to jihad for the sake of Allah and one's will to shed blood, smash skulls, and chop off body parts... constitute an honor for the believer."" This was not the first time any of these four preachers was permitted to deliver a guest sermon at the Education City Mosque. Nor are they its only speakers with a record of hate speech.

Yet the mosque's guest preacher for that very event was Saudi cleric Saleh al-Moghamsy, who had previously opined on Qatari TV that bin Laden died with more dignity than any Christian, Jew, Zoroastrian, apostate, or atheist simply by virtue of being a Muslim. Moghamsy has also asserted that God created women as an ""ornament"" to men. Another guest preacher at the mosque has previously declared that ""the dumbest girl is that who judges her beauty with the number of those who molest her.

President Obama missed a real opportunity to make clear that Qatar's embrace of such hate preachers violates its 2014 pledge to aid the fight against the Islamic State by ""repudiating their hateful ideology."" Even the Emir himself has embraced several such hate preachers in the past year. And providing prestigious platforms to those who advocate killing infidels would seem to be a rather blatant violation of that 2014 pledge.Further, if these six American colleges turn a blind eye to the problem, they would convey the impression that they care more about Gulf petrodollars than creating a tolerant atmosphere for female students and religious minorities, for whom such incitement could pose even a physical danger on campus. The U.S. universities with programs in Qatar reportedly receive a combined $320 million a year from the Qatar Foundation to sustain their campuses in the energy-rich city state. Cornell alone reportedly receives an astonishing yearly outlay of $122 million.Of course, such generous, recurring payments give school administrators a powerful incentive to remain silent about the revolving door of hate preachers at the Education City Mosque. But improving the selection of these guest preachers would actually make U.S.-Qatari education programming more sustainable by removing one of the biggest potential obstacles to continued cooperation. Regardless, these schools may have no choice in the matter. Their students and faculty have already begun to raise concerns about systematic labor abuses in Qatar, as well as potential risks to academic inquiry in a nation that throws people in jail for insulting religion or the ruler. There are many more people of good conscience in student government, campus groups, faculty bodies, and university boards who would be shocked to learn about the appalling promotion of hate speech inside Qatar's glittering Education City.

32,POLITICS,Presidential Campaigns Make U.S./Mexico Benefits Invisible,"Carl Nettleton, ContributorWriter, speaker, facilitator, and analyst with expertise in oc...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/presidential-campaigns-ma_b_9814704.html,,2016-04-30,2016-04-30-1462046560-8763440-IMG_4085TijuanaInnovadoraMeetingOstickBurnhamGalicot.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-30-1462046560-8763440-IMG_4085TijuanaInnovadoraMeetingOstickBurnhamGalicot-thumb.jpg,"Much has been said during the 2016 presidential race about the need for a wall on the U.S./Mexico border, the asserted perils of the North American Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the crimes attributed to undocumented immigrants. These opinions are formed primarily by candidates with little personal connection to the U.S./Mexico border. John Kasich, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders are all northeasterners (Ohio, New York, and Vermont). Only Ted Cruz from Texas comes from a state on the border.These distant perspectives make the benefits of the U.S./Mexico relationship essentially invisible to the public because the dialogue has been skewed by politics and limited or erroneous facts, creating a public reaction detrimental to the growing and mutually-beneficial economic ties between the two countries. ""U.S. exports of goods and services to Mexico supported an estimated 1.1 million jobs in 2014.""For starters, U.S./Mexico trade was valued at $583.6 billion in 2014 and Mexico provides the U.S. with its second largest export market. Mexico purchased more than 15 percent of U.S. exports, valued at $267.2 billion, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. In return, the U.S. purchased $316.4 billion in goods and services from Mexico. U.S. exports of goods and services to Mexico supported an estimated 1.1 million U.S. jobs in 2014.The Wilson Institute reports that every product dollar the U.S. imports from Mexico contains forty cents of U.S. products. Canadian imports contain 25 cents, China four cents, and the European Union two cents. Exports to Mexico are important to state economies, too. According to the Foreign Trade Division of the U.S. Census Bureau, Texas benefits most with more than $94 billion in merchandise sales to Mexico, almost 40 percent of the U.S. total. California was second with nearly $27 billion in sales. Significant economic benefit goes to Midwestern states where anti-trade sentiment is centered. Michigan had the third most U.S. exports to Mexico with $11 billion in sales in 2014. Ford, a Michigan company, has been criticized by some candidates for moving a manufacturing plant to Mexico. However, a significant percentage of U.S. parts needed for production in the new plant, some made in Michigan, will likely be exported to Mexico before the final vehicle is imported back into the U.S. ""The Wilson Institute reports that every dollar of products that the U.S. imports from Mexico contains forty cents of U.S. products. Canadian imports contain 25 cents, China four cents, and the European Union two cents.""Other Midwestern or non-border states in the top ten of U.S. exports to Mexico include Illinois ($9 billion), Ohio ($6 billion), Indiana ($4.8 billion), Tennessee ($4.7 billion), and Pennsylvania ($4.2 billion). The value of the relationships between the two countries can be better understood by looking at the ties between San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Baja California. Known as the CaliBaja Megaregion, these adjoining metropolitan areas have a combined population of six million residents, three million each. The political, business, cultural, and policy communities on both sides of the border clearly understand how the bi-national economies benefit each other.On April 15, 2016, more than 50 community leaders attended a planning meeting of Tijuana Innovadora (Innovative Tijuana). Innovadora is a week-long event held every two years in Tijuana and planned by leaders from both sides of the border. The event brings Nobel Prize winners, international newsmakers and regional innovation leaders to Tijuana. Guests have included Al Gore, Carlos Slim and many other luminaries. Innovadora is organized through ten spheres of influence that include business development, sports, volunteerism, the digital community, environment, art, and youth.Among the attendees at a planning meeting for Tijuana Innovadora on April 15, 2016, were (from left to right) U.S. Consul General William Ostick and Co-Chairs San Diego philanthropist Malin Burnham and Innovadora founder Jose Galicot Behar. Photo credit: the author.  Visitors to Tijuana enter the city at San Ysidro via a modern port of entry and travel down Paseo de los Héroes, a large boulevard with a tree-lined and landscaped median. They pass fine restaurants, U.S. big box stores like Costco and Home Depot, a Pizza Hut, an Applebees, and the CECUT, Tijuana's cultural center. This modern city is home to more than 600 maquiladoras (Mexican factories run by a foreign company) that produce high quality electronics, medical devices, aerospace and automobile parts, and other products. Former San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, now the CEO of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, likes to say that all of the Toyota Tacoma pickups sold in the U.S. are made in Tijuana, and that more medical devices are made in that city than anywhere else. One maquiladora, SMK Electronics, makes two million remote controls each week for a variety of name-brand companies.Sanders' Chamber of Commerce has made cross-border trade and relationships one of the pillars of its programs. The organization annually sponsors trips to Washington D.C. and Mexico City attended by approximately 100 leaders from both sides of the border to push for mutually beneficial initiatives. Local, state and federal agencies and other organizations together support projects that reduce border wait times. $1.3 billion in U.S. border improvements have been completed or are underway on the U.S. side. Complimentary Mexican projects have also been built or are near completion. Elected officials, community and business leaders from both sides of the border met on April 15, 2016, to celebrate $1.3 billion in border infrastructure improvements. Photo credit: the author.Those improvements are needed because the San Ysidro, Otay Mesa, and Tecate ports of entry in San Diego County together represent one of the world's largest border crossings. In 2014, on average, 130,000 people legally crossed the border into the U.S. through one of these ports of entry each day. At San Ysidro alone, 29.5 million people crossed the border into the U.S. in 2014, and an equal amount crossed in the other direction. The two-way traffic count included 39.5 million private vehicles and buses at the three ports of entry and 1.7 million trucks. This bi-national economy brings $6 billion in direct economic impact to San Diego annually, and the infrastructure improvements are designed to capture some of the additional $7 billion in local economic benefits lost because of long border wait times. A new fourth crossing will be paid for by tolls, charging for the opportunity to save time. To determine what the market will bear, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) commissioned a study that showed 36 percent cross the border to work and 37 percent to shop. Of those crossing for work, 45 percent work in Mexico and 44 percent work in the U.S. These statistics and others indicate the two-way benefits to both San Diego and Tijuana and, by extension, the U.S. and Mexico. ""We share families, culture and jobs,"" says Chamber CEO Sanders, ""and the brainpower and universities on both sides of the border make us an economic powerhouse."" Sanders backs his claims by pointing out that Mexico is producing more engineers each year than the U.S., and that they are equally capable. That capability is contributing to Mexico's growth from an economy with a GDP ranked fifteenth in the world to one some economists say will move into the top ten in coming decades.That brainpower is leading to cross-border academic relations, too. University of California, San Diego, Chancellor Pradeep Khosla signed an MOU on March 3, 2016, with Dr. Fernando León García, the President of CETYS University, one of Mexico's top technical universities, adding to MOU's previously established with the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COCEF) and the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California. Another long-term relationship exists between San Diego State University and COCEF, and Southwestern College hosts the San Diego Center for International Trade Development. These and other academic relationships throughout California and the nation support the bi-national 100,000 Strong initiative that hopes 100,000 college students from each country will eventually be studying in a university across the border. CETYS University President Dr. Fernando León García (l) and UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla (r) enjoy a light moment after signing an MOU between the two schools on March 3, 2016. Photo credit: the author.San Diego and Tijuana share the environment, too, including a coastline on the Pacific Ocean and the Tijuana River. Flooding and pollution coming across the border into the Tijuana River Valley has long been a contentious issue between the two countries but is now being addressed by the Tijuana River Valley Recovery Team, a collaborative group of agencies, organizations and stakeholders from both sides of the border.So what has become highly visible to the nation during the presidential race (border walls, undocumented immigrants, lost U.S. jobs) has made invisible the value of the economic, cultural and personal relationships that are thriving not only between San Diego and Tijuana but between the two nations. The CaliBaja Megaregion is betting there will be even more mutual benefits in the future, both locally and nationally, if the national dialogue will allow those benefits to become visible."

(To prove how long the Comedy USA concept has been around, there's an interview on the site with Jerry Seinfeld from 1986!)Weintraub's guest in the most recent drop is John Mulrooney. Mulrooney started doing standup in the late 70's and, like many of his East Coast brethren, heard the siren's song of television and was lured out to Los Angeles during the comedy boom of the 80's and early 90's.And he ended up doing his share of TV stints -- from appearances on The Tonight Show and taking over the reins of a late night talk show on Fox Television that had been hosted by Joan Rivers, to getting another gig at the same network for two years of hosting Comic Strip Live and many other TV spots as well.Given their shared history coming up through the comedy ranks of New York, though, it isn't long before Weintraub and his guest are recalling the early days of hell gigs and one nighters (often the same thing) in clubs long gone that once stood within a gas tank's load outside of town.There are also rollicking tales of shooting handguns outside Las Vegas (Mulrooney is a gun enthusiast) and the sorts of things he's up to now when he's not still popping up on stage along the Eastern seaboard. It seems he's always been a fan of law enforcement, to the extent that he got himself a part-time patrolman gig with a small police force in a town with a name only a comic could love: Coxsackie, New York.It seems old comics never die, their lives just get more ironic.(Note: This podcast is not yet available via iTunes.)• • •Podcasts I'm also listening to this week: Chillpak Hollywood Hour -- #467: The LA Breakfast Club, and Taboo Tales -- Diane Pershing & The Illegal Transaction• • •The Schmoozecast review and other podcasts mentioned originally posted as part of This Week In Comedy Podcasts on Splitsider.com.Marc Hershon is the host and executive producer of Succotash, The Comedy Podcast Podcast, featuring clips from comedy podcasts from across the Internet as well as interviews with podcasters, comedians, and assorted show biz folk."

37,POLITICS,Friday Talking Points -- Lucifer or a Joe McCarthy-Dracula Love Child?,"Chris Weigant, ContributorPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/friday-talking-points_b_9812136.html,"Boy, it isn't every day you get to write a headline like that!

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks during a rally at the Hoosier Gym in Knightstown, Ind. Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are having a tough time attracting establishment Republican donors even as they intensify their efforts to derail the nomination of billionaire Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb93bae200000070201efae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Boy, it isn't every day you get to write a headline like that! But those are the kinds of feelings Ted Cruz seems to bring out in everyone -- left, right, and center.On the right, doesn't John Boehner sound a lot looser and more relaxed now that he isn't responsible for herding a bunch of hyperactive cats in the House? He certainly seemed like it this week, in what was supposed to be an unrecorded talk. Of course, these days, everyone in politics should just automatically assume that everything they say will be recorded, because the chances are it will be. When asked what he personally thought about Ted Cruz, Boehner responded: ""Lucifer in the flesh."" In case anyone thought he was kidding, he followed this up with: ""I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life."" C'mon, tell us what you really think, John!Not to be outdone, Representative Peter King (who, earlier, said he'd drink cyanide if Cruz were to become his party's nominee) piled on to Boehner's comment by responding: ""Maybe he gives Lucifer a bad name by comparing him to Ted Cruz."" This is likely the first time that Peter King and actual Satanists have agreed on anything, it should be noted. We're not sure if this is any sort of sign of the impending apocalypse, but then we're not the theological (demonic?) experts that King and Boehner seem to be. And, please remember, this is what fellow Republicans are saying about the man who is supposed to somehow be ""saving the party"" from Donald Trump!Over on the left, Al Franken is starting to be confident enough that people take him seriously as a senator to actually give himself permission to be funny once again. Franken, in excerpts from a roast in Minnesota, does a hilarious impression of Paul Ryan as an 18th-century fop denying he has any presidential ambitions (""No, no, I shan't run""), and he also took the time to share his own impression of what, exactly, Ted Cruz really is: ""the love child of Joe McCarthy and Dracula.""Perhaps this outbreak of levity was due to Washington currently being in its giddy run-up to the granddaddy of political roasts, the White House Correspondents' Dinner. The White House itself got in on the fun today, and turned over the briefing podium to fictional character C. J. Cregg (press secretary on The West Wing, played by Allison Janney). Since this will be President Obama's last official roast, it'll be interesting to see what jokes he's been holding back until now.But we're getting distracted. Back to the presidential campaign trail. Ted Cruz, realizing that time is fast running out on any chance he's going to have of winning the Republican nomination (his entire candidacy may actually expire next Tuesday, in Indiana), made a desperation move -- what's being called his ""Hail Carly"" play. He announced his (non-existent) running mate will be none other than Carly Fiorina.This is a naked move to grab some California delegates, of course. Carly originally hailed from the Golden State, but what Ted Cruz seems to have missed is that she hasn't exactly been a success out here. But we have to defer to Senator Barbara Boxer, since Boxer was the one Fiorina lost to by 10 points after spending a whopping amount of money (on ""demon sheep"" ads, no less). Boxer's reaction to Fiorina being named by Cruz was priceless:[Fiorina] hasn't held office, any office, be it Senate, House, state legislature, local government, not a minute's worth, and her claim to fame is running a large corporation which she practically destroyed, Hewlett-Packard, the pride of California. I think it just shows Ted Cruz has no judgment whatsoever by choosing her. I think if Carly Fiorina is on a national ticket, that would be really good for the Democrats because... in the worst year for Democrats, and I mean it, I beat her by one million votes. We just showed her record when she was at HP and how selfish she is as a human being.Boxer followed this skewering up with a tweet, in case anyone still had any doubts how she felt: ""I predict that the latest @CarlyFiorina merger will be as successful as her last one.""The real irony is that this all might be meaningless, if Ted Cruz loses Indiana next Tuesday. Cruz didn't do himself any good in the basketball-crazy Hoosier State by talking about the ""basketball ring"" to a crowd. Hoo boy. Basketball ring? Really? Donald Trump then made things worse for Cruz by announcing the endorsement of infamous hometown coach (and chair-hurler) Bobby Knight. Knight, of course, had the best response to the Cruz gaffe: ""A guy that would come into this state and think that we play with rings instead of baskets is not a guy that's very well prepared to do a hell of a lot.""We stand on the brink of both parties' nomination races being essentially over, in fact. This was due to Trump sweeping all five states last Tuesday night, and Hillary Clinton winning four out of five. As Hillary begins her pivot (long-awaited, by her) to a general election campaign strategy, she is already going out of her way to attempt to woo Bernie voters over to her camp. George ""Mr. Sulu"" Takei even helped this effort out, in a video he posted on Facebook taking exception with the ""Bernie or Bust"" folks.Tuesday was also a good night for the establishment wing of the Democratic Party in general, as two Senate primaries were won (in Maryland and Pennsylvania) by the party insiders' favored candidates.In other election news, the citizens of Maine will get the chance to vote on legalizing recreational marijuana this November. Nevada has already qualified a ballot measure, and California will also likely be voting on the issue. Watch for the number of states with outright legalization measures on the ballot to increase, in the coming months. Currently, four states and the Nation's Capital have already legalized recreational adult use, and the sky hasn't noticeably fallen in any of them.Even with such progress, we've still got a long way to go, though. The Washington Post deserves kudos for shining a spotlight on the worst abuses of the War On Drugs in the past months, in a series of articles they've run on the legal highway robbery known as ""asset forfeiture."" This week, they published a story about a church group from Burma who were pulled over in Oklahoma for a broken taillight. No drugs or paraphernalia were found in their vehicle, but the cops just went ahead and confiscated over $50,000 because these people had the temerity to carry it around with them in cash.Mere days later, a followup story ran, because local district attorney Orvil Loge decided to drop all charges and return the money in full. His reason?""I looked at the case and met with the officers and determined that we would not be able to meet the burden of proof in the criminal case and in the civil case,"" Loge said in an interview. He also cited the press coverage of the story and said that his office has heard from ""a lot of citizens"" who were upset about the details of the case.That is what is known as the mainstream media being a force for good (for once). This happens every day in America -- cops just confiscate money from hapless drivers, and then the legal burden of proof is on the driver, to prove in court that the money wasn't illegal drug proceeds or from anything nefarious. This turns our entire ""innocent until proven guilty"" legal system on its head, and the practice (which is, sadly, all too common) needs to be stopped. The Post is to be applauded for bringing public opinion to bear on these excesses, which obviously worked wonders in this particular case.There was really only one candidate for this week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award this week, mostly because his action took place as we were writing last week's column. Everyone else had his high bar to match, all week long, and nobody really came close.Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe last week restored the voting rights of over 200,000 convicted felons. As the state's executive, his pardon powers are pretty much absolute, and he used them in a muscular way. Beyond his action, he then did the rounds of television interviews to justify what he had just done in exemplary fashion.His argument was a simple one. First, lifetime voting bans have an ugly history in Virginia, being one of the original Jim Crow laws specifically designed to suppress the African-American vote. Second, and more importantly, there is an excellent moral reason for not banning ex-prisoners from voting forever. As McAuliffe explained multiple times last weekend, when you commit a crime you are tried for that crime by a judge and jury. If found guilty, you are given a sentence. That should be your entire punishment -- what is handed down by judge and jury. When you have served your prison time, your parole, or your probation, you are supposed to have paid your full debt to society. After you have done so, the best possible outcome is that you fully integrate back into law-abiding society and become a productive citizen once again. Part of that is having a voice in your government. Screwing up when you are 20 should not mean you never get to vote again for the rest of your life, unless you are actually given a life sentence in prison.This is a very basic concept and a very moral argument to make, and McAuliffe did so quite convincingly last week. Of course, he was hit by Republicans for doing so, because (in their opinion) McAuliffe is just trying to create lots of new Democratic voters who will vote for Hillary Clinton in November. This ignores the fact that McAuliffe campaigned on the issue to get where he is today, and it also presupposes that every ex-felon will automatically vote Democratic. What, after all, is stopping the Republican Party from vying for their votes? Nobody's going to force these people to vote, and nobody's going to force them to vote for one candidate over another.Not every state even has such laws to overturn. Banning ex-felons from voting isn't a universal concept, in other words. In fact, it is nothing more than a Jim Crow era holdover -- one that needs to be thrown on the ash heap of history along with all the rest of the ugliness that era produced.Terry McAuliffe made a bold stand by doing what was right. No matter when it might have happened, the Republicans were bound to moan about ""politics"" influencing the decision. But by doing so, they are fully admitting that the policy is designed to suppress Democratic votes. That, right there, is enough of a reason to scrap the policy, in fact. Politics was part of the law all along, and getting rid of it means returning to the constitutional ideal of only being legally punished by the sentence a judge and jury hands down. If some serial voter fraudster is ever prosecuted in the future, then perhaps part of that punishment could be a lifetime ban from voting -- but only if it is part of the actual court sentence.For doing the right thing, and for standing up to the naysayers with a very cogent and well-delivered moral argument, Terry McAuliffe is indeed this week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week this week.[Congratulate Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on his official contact page, to let him know you appreciate his efforts.]President Obama is trying to implement a change in the way Medicare compensates doctors for expensive drugs. Rather than raking off a percentage of the drug's cost (which gives an incentive to doctors to prescribe the absolute most-expensive drug in the marketplace), instead change much of the compensation to a fixed amount. Remove the big cash incentive, and doctors can prescribe the best available medicine -- even if it's cheaper.However, the drug lobby is pretty powerful on Capitol Hill, which has led to not only the expected Republican balking at the new initiative but also Democrats shamefully pushing back on the White House as well.This isn't even the most drastic idea for bringing down prescription drug costs -- that would be allowing the federal government to bargain with the drugmakers over the prices themselves (something the prescription drug law passed under George W. Bush specifically prohibits). This is just slightly changing the way doctors rake in what is essentially a kickback for prescribing the most expensive drug they can possibly prescribe.So we're handing out a group Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award this week, for any Democrat who has so far signed one of the letters pushing back on this Obama initiative, and certainly for any who ultimately wind up voting against the president. This is precisely what Bernie Sanders is talking about when he rails against the pernicious influence campaign donations have on our political system. The drug industry has one of the most powerful lobbying efforts in Washington, and this is precisely what their money buys them.[Since this is a group award, you'll have to contact your own members of Congress to ask what their positions are on the issue, sorry.]Volume 389 (4/29/16)This week, we start out with three positive talking points for Democrats, and then (just because) four negative talking points about the insanity that is passing for the Republican nomination race. Enjoy, as always, and use responsibly. Automatic registrationThis sort of thing needs to happen everywhere.""Vermont just became the fourth state -- joining Oregon, California, and West Virginia -- in making voter registration automatic when visiting the state's department of motor vehicles to get a driver's license. Unless you specifically opt out, you are automatically registered to vote as you register to drive. This is nothing short of common sense, and streamlines government paperwork. In fact, how anyone could be against such a good idea is beyond me. After Oregon became the first state to implement the idea this January, voter registration rates there have quadrupled. The only reason to be against such a plan is if you think your political party is incapable of convincing new voters to vote for you -- there is no other reason why voter registration shouldn't be as easy as possible for everyone. This is an idea whose time has come, and I look forward to many other states following Vermont in passing such laws as soon as possible."" Brand New CongressThis is heartening to see, because it would be a real shame if all the energy and momentum behind Bernie Sanders dissipated into thin air afterwards. The revolution should continue.""Former Bernie Sanders staff and volunteers announced the creation of Brand New Congress, which will look ahead to the 2018 midterm elections, in order to 'replace Congress all at once.' Although they're likely to fall far short of that lofty ambition, it is good to see that an effort is being made to translate the enormous wave of support Bernie has gotten into a positive movement for change at the congressional level. They plan to set up local search committees to recruit strong progressive candidates for the House and Senate -- whether they be a Republican or a Democrat. Now that nobody sneers at grassroots campaigns any more (and the millions they can bring in, with very small individual donations), it will be interesting to see if Brand New Congress can make an impact in the next midterm elections. Progressives need to continue the fight that Bernie has been fighting, all up and down the ticket. This is how real political change actually happens"" Fourth Amendment should apply to all emailNot many people were even aware of this quirky loophole in the law, but that vote count certainly seems promising.""The House just voted unanimously -- 419 to 0 -- to close a gaping loophole in the laws concerning searching emails. Due to a law passed long before most people even used email, all emails six months old or older have not required a warrant for police to search. Yes, you heard that right -- only the last six months of your emails are protected from random government searches. Any older than that, and the government could force Gmail or whatever provider to hand over all your data with no warrant at all. This law obviously needs updating, to fit the modern world. Emails should be just as protected by the Fourth Amendment as any other personal records. It was indeed heartening to see the House vote unanimously to do exactly that. It certainly gives hope that the Senate will now act and close this loophole forever."" Hand me a 9-bludgeon...OK, you just knew this one was going to be here, right?""I hear that Ted Cruz recently referred to a, quote, basketball ring, unquote. Wow. That's just... wow. I look forward to more sports-related observations from Ted, such as his thoughts on: 'the U-shaped poles' on a football field, swinging a 'baseball stick' and hitting 'a tour of the cornerbags,' returning a tennis serve with your 'netswatter' across the 'mesh fence,' or hitting a golf ball with the 'bludgeons' in your bag. Seriously, has Ted Cruz ever even come into contact with the world of sports? Surely he must have been in a bar when a game was on television, or something."" Just wait five minutes...Trump gave a big foreign policy speech this week. He read off a TelePrompTer and everything! Only problem was, as John Soltz masterfully pointed out, he contradicted himself on pretty much everything he said.""Did you catch Donald Trump's foreign policy speech? It didn't matter whether you agreed with him or not, all you had to do was wait five minutes and he would wind up contradicting what he had just finished saying. America 'must be prepared to let [NATO] countries defend themselves' if they won't pay more... but also America is 'going to be a great and reliable ally again.' America's foreign policy goals need to be defined, because since the Cold War ended 'we've lacked a coherent foreign policy'... but then 'we must as a nation be more unpredictable,' because 'we are totally predictable.' On issue after issue, Trump would state one position and then state precisely the opposite moments later. The whole thing was downright incoherent -- if you didn't like what you heard, all you had to do was hit yourself in the head with a hammer to forget it, and two minutes later Trump would say the opposite. Is that really how America wants to conduct foreign policy?"" Most votes against, too!Thanks to the Washington Post for pointing this one out.""Donald Trump has been making a big deal out of the fact that he may get the 'most Republican votes ever' for any presidential candidate. Well, that's true, he is within reach of breaking George W. Bush's record. But what he fails to mention is that he's already set a record when it comes to counting GOP voters. More Republicans have voted against Trump than have ever voted against any other nominee in history. The biggest turnout in Republican primary history isn't for Trump -- it is, in fact, against Trump."" Carly's nails on a chalkboardWe absolutely must put a warning on this one. Don't follow this link and watch the video if you have just eaten, because you will be in danger of losing your lunch. Don't say we didn't warn you!""We seriously thought we had seen the last of Carly Fiorina, but then Ted Cruz went ahead and named her his hypothetical running mate. As if it wasn't bad enough to see Fiorina gnashing her teeth on television again, what was truly frightening was when she -- for some unfathomable reason -- decided to woo the audience with her singing. Or, more accurately, her 'alleged singing.' What made it even worse (if that's even possible, which we doubt) was that she says she's been doing this sort of thing in front of children. Now, being the child of Ted Cruz is horrific enough to contemplate without also being frightened by the likes of Carly Fiorina attempting a lullaby.

She clapped enthusiastically at the end of each piece. It was a true joy to see her so happy.Then Carolyn declined significantly. She was receiving hospice care and was always in bed when I arrived. Her eyes were usually closed, even though she was often awake. I talked to her but she never said anything back.Nonetheless I kept playing the Nutcracker Suite for her every time. She showed no reaction whatsoever. I was frustrated but kept it up anyway.Then one day I asked, ""Do you like it?""Her response was shocking to say the least. She immediately opened her eyes widely and said in a loud, clear voice, ""Very much."" It was proof that she was still ""there"" -- still aware of her surroundings even though she rarely acknowledged it and even though she was literally on her death bed. She died a week later.People with Alzheimer's -- especially those in the later stages of the disease -- may stop talking or making other clear attempts to communicate. Too often we assume they don't know what's going on around them. We think they don't understand what people are saying to them or about them. My experience with Carolyn shows that's not always the case. I had two similar experiences with another woman I visited, too. We'll call her Sue. Sue was very frail -- physically and mentally. She, too, was receiving hospice care. About all I could do with her at my visits was hold her hand and talk to her softly. She never said anything to me.I was surprised beyond belief one day when I told her that I knew her daughter and that she must be very proud of her. Suddenly Sue's face came to life. She pursed her lips and shook her head vigorously from side to side. It was perfectly clear that she was not proud of her daughter at all. And it was perfectly clear that she wanted me to know that.But the most touching moment with Sue came a few weeks later. On my tenth visit I was holding her hand as usual. Then she slowly raised her other hand, put it on my arm and began to gently stroke my arm. If I had any doubts about her awareness of her surroundings, this action abolished them. Sue was, indeed, still ""there,"" although she, too, was at the very latest stages of the illness and passed away three days later.The lesson in these examples is that just because people with Alzheimer's don't talk doesn't mean they aren't perfectly aware of what's going on. As a result we should never talk about them as though they aren't present and we should never say anything to them (or to others in the room) that we wouldn't say to them if they were able to talk.Another lesson is that we should keep visiting our loved ones with Alzheimer's and keep talking to them even if they don't recognize us and even if they don't say anything to us. They may be enjoying the visit immensely but just unable to tell us that.Marie Marley is the award-winning author of the uplifting book, Come Back Early Today: A Memoir of Love, Alzheimer's and Joy, and the co-author (with Daniel C.

But I first saw Jason in the ABC series Mistresses. I knew I had to interview this guy.Please visit NYCastings to see my other interview with Jason George, which goes more in depth into his acting career! Really good stuff!What was your favorite trip to NYC like?My favorite trip to New York City... Last summer, my wife and I left the kids with her mom and flew to New York, just the two of us. We woke up that Friday morning and had almost forgotten that it was September 11. I turned on the television and regular programming was interrupted by the local memorial ceremony. I was truly moved by all of the regular people reciting the names of people lost in the Twin Towers almost a decade and a half ago. We dressed and went down to the Freedom Tower and the 9/11 Memorial which had throngs of people milling about. I wouldn't call the mood sad but rather sobering. It was also electric in the way that everybody there felt connected. I don't know if it was just a common understanding of the value of life or a deeper sense of patriotism or a united determination that we will not be intimidated, but nobody felt like a complete stranger at the memorial that day.Then we took a lazy walk through Central Park. After laying on the grass watching kids play and watching street performers dance and flip over each other, we heard that Serena Williams had lost at the US Open. We were wrecked. The whole inspiration for the NYC trip in the first place was to see Serena make tennis history. We went from a low to the highest of highs though because I had walked over broken glass to get us tickets to see the Broadway show HAMILTON that night and meet the cast after the show. I have since been accused of being a paid publicist for the show but it really is that good. You actually can believe the hype. #Bam4Ham is no joke. If it were just a good play I wouldn't mention it here but I honestly think it should be required viewing for every high school student in this country. Sure, students will see history come to life and become proud of and more curious about the founding of their country, but most important it will remind all students - especially the black and brown ones - that this is their country, too. Hamilton was the bastard son of a single mother prostitute who immigrated to this country without a dime to his name. Swagger, a quick mind and a quick pen made him one of the most successful and powerful people in the country. True for Hamilton. True for Barrack Obama, Kanye West, Oprah Winfrey and maybe it'll be true for that kid from the hood.The next day we got up went to the US Open's women's final to watch two Italian women we had barely heard of play each other. Then we had fantastic dinner, drinks and laughs at my boy Binh Douglas's restaurant, Henri on Fifth. The next day we watched Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer in a phenomenal finals match.Best New York trip ever.Whose idea was it to keep your facial hair?I've just always rocked the goatee. Maybe a beard for a minute or some thick sideburns but I've only been clean shaven for like two days in my adult life. Maybe it goes back to that time I shaved before going back to Ma's house from college. She opened the door, looked at my smooth face and said ""I just wanna smack you!"" I laughed and asked what did I do wrong. She said, ""You look just like your damn father - about the time I divorced him!"" Maybe that memory stuck, maybe I just like the goatee.You're very outspoken with your political views. Which issues do you want the next President to concentrate on?I need my President to be prepared to handle all the critical issues our country faces. National security, International relations, the rising cost of education, comprehensive immigration reform that supports kids who are American in the hearts. She needs to be ready to do the job on day one. I'm sorry, did I say she...yeah, I did.Gun Violence and Social Justice are near and dear to my heart. And they are so connected it's sad. Gun Violence takes disproportionately more black and brown lives. Too many women's lives in domestic violence situations. And Congress is so afraid of NRA money the government doesn't even track gun violence -- not even gun violence involving law enforcement. It took investigative journalists to find out that 25% of unarmed suspects shot by LA police in a five year period were black. Call me crazy but I think whenever a cop shoots somebody, right or wrong, that it should be recorded.You appear to be quite the charmer. Give us some childhood background. Did anything from your childhood help shape your acting career?I'm one of three boys raised by a single mom in a military beach town in the South. You learn colorful language and phrases but you also learn manners, how to swim well, and how to hold your own in a fight. Ma was an educator so a sharp mind was valued more than a three pointer. We didn't have much money so a sense of humor was necessary because laughing is hella more fun than crying.We had the Star Wars album -- not just the music from Star Wars but literally every sound from the movie including dialogue, sound effects and music. We wore that thing out. And then we took a tape recorder and some toys that made crazy sounds and made about six hour's worth of our own science fiction radio play. Probably the start of my acting career. Probably best that they stay lost in a storage box at Ma's place.  Jason, I want to hear that six hours of tape you and your brothers made! But I'll settle for dessert with you and your wife on your next trip to NYC :) -- ILANABe sure to check out my NYCastings interview with Jason George!"
