It was our second day of a weeklong trip exploring Croatia outdoor activities and nature wonders. We set off for an afternoon canoe trip with 4 Rivers Adventure through the dramatic canyons of the Mreznica River. En route, we stopped briefly in the tired town of Karlovac, home to the Museum of Croatian Independence War. While there are future plans to enclose the museum in a building, right now it's a project in the works. Battle-worn vehicles -- a rusted-out Howitzer, fighter planes, tanks and tractors refitted as a makeshift tanks -- were scattered around a field. They were all used during the Croatian war of Independence from 1990 to 1995. Unnerving and eye-opening, my visit was harsh reminder that while I was watching Seinfeld, The Wonder Years and Doogie Howser M.D., kids my age in Croatia were hiding from exploding bombs. It was nearly 1:00 p.m. when we reached the Mreznica River. The swirling skies threatened rain. While late May in Croatia is usually balmy, an average of 80 degrees, during our visit a cold cyclone covered most of Europe. Alas, my tank tops and shorts stayed packed and by the end of the week, my well-worn jeans and ExOfficio jacket could walk by themselves.As raindrops danced on the van's roof, we wiggled into thick neoprene farmer-john wetsuits and water booties. I cringed thinking about leaving the warm van to launch into the chilly river. Donning helmets and red PFDs, we carried sturdy double canoes down the gravel road to the put-in. The river hummed and the whitewater revved my endorphins. James, a fellow New Yorker, was my paddling partner. He steered in the back, while I motored upfront. Our posse of five canoes took off down the flowing category II & III river like little ducks in a row. A typical 'Karst' river, the Mreznica has bountiful travertine waterfalls interspersed with turquoise calm water. Upon reaching our first small waterfall, we disembarked, stepping into the knee-high water and tossing the boats to the still pool below. The current was strong and pushy as I picked my way across the mossy slippery rocks, leaning on a boulder so as to not be washed away. The payoff was outstanding. Before finding our boats, I stood atop a rocky plateau, inhaling a breathtaking view of the water below wending through emerald wilderness and jagged limestone cliffs. James and I clapped our hands like school children embarking on a super fun adventure, but the rest of the group was not enthused or amused. Just 10 minutes into our paddle, three of our travel mates abandoned canoes and headed upstream to wait out the storm in a farmhouse. That left me, James and Mia, who is originally from Croatia but now works in NYC -- and our hearty guide Mario Mihajlik and his assistant. They both wore thin white tee shirts. I wore two anoraks for extra warmth. James and I got in a good rhythm on the flowing river, swooshing through gentle rapids, past verdant forests, jagged limestone walls and hidden caves. It felt good to be on the water and a welcome change from paddling on the turbulent Hudson River in NYC. I was rain-soaked and didn't mind wading through the chilly water at the half-dozen mini-waterfalls -- except once. ""We have to jump."" Said Mario, a strong, burly man with a boisterous personality. On hot, sunny days this five-foot plunge is a highlight of the trip, but I shivered thinking about being pulled under the cool water. Mario, who started leading paddle trips on the Mreznica River just after the war ended, around 1995, grabbed my hand and towed me through the current until we stood on the big rock with water gushing along our shins. ""Hi-Yo!"" He sprang with the agility of a cat, landing into the pool of water below with a big splash. I quickly followed. Plunk! Cold water smacked my face and streamed down my neck and back. I got an instant ice cream headache. Brr! Popping to the surface, I found Mario's outstretched big, callused hand waiting to pull me from the dynamic water. With his other hand, he passed me a worn silver flask. It was cold to touch but filled my belly with warming honey grappa. Oh! How I love Croatia. Mia and James got the same grappa welcome. Two-and-a-half hours after launching, we reached the take-out. The rain ceased and sun fought to shine. Refreshed and fiercely hungry, we met the others in a nearby hut. A crew of 20-something hipsters, living (and cooking) off the land, had prepared a grilled whole trout luncheon, al fresco. It was one of the most memorable - and flavorful - meals of the trip. The warm, crusty homemade bread (they even had gluten-free, for me) was the perfect vehicle for the smoky trout pate and addictive wild leek pesto. Mario, bless his sturdy soul, brought local wine. We toasted to our wet, wild adventure while savoring juicy trout, crunchy roast potatoes, cabbage slaw and zesty zucchini salad. The next day, we walked up the grassy hill of Cave Park Grabova toward Samograd Cave with our young, enthusiastic guide. There was a cool mid-afternoon breeze, and clouds filled the grey sky. Croatia has restored many of their over 7000 caves and pits for public educational exploring. Of the three caves we visited - including Veternica and Lokvarka cave - Samograd was my favorite. With a clink, the heavy metal entrance gate swung open and my eyes blinked, madly adjusting from daylight. Holding the cool metal rails, I cautiously stepped down the metal stairs - clunk, clunk, clunk! - leading to the cave's cool, calm belly. I was immediately engulfed in instant Zen, as if I just walked out of an exceptional yoga class. The chilly moist air was clean and crisp like that from a humidifier.Prior to the trip, I was concerned about feeling claustrophobic in this land down under, as some caves reach more than 3,000 feet deep. But I felt quite the opposite. The four halls of Somograd were big and spacious with high ceilings. Sections of muted, multi-tone brown and grey rock walls were a patchwork of textures, calcifications and trickling fissures of water.Although it officially opened to the public in 2009, work started in 1989, when over 50 spotlights and handrails where installed by a local community of Perušić. But the Croatian War of Independence halted restoration until 2000, when the Mountaineering society of Samograd kick-started new efforts. Interestingly, live classical music concerts are held in some of Croatia's caves, which must be amazing given the incredible acoustics. When I screamed (I was given permission) the sound echoed for several seconds. Another morning, we joined cycling guide Alez for a 30 km bike ride through the picturesque Istrian countryside, known for its wine and truffles. As we drove up into the stone walled diminutive medieval enclave of Roc, in North Istria, I half expected to see Dino and Fred Flinstone playing fetch in the tiny ancient village. Once home to a sprawling stone castle and the epicenter of Croatian publishing (based on the Glagolitic alphabet between the 12-20th centuries) Roc has become a tourist and school trip destination. After a brief tour of the grey stone church dedicated to Saint Anthony of the Desert, the worn stone archway and the tarnished antiquated cannon, we mounted our bikes. The mid-morning, 70-degree sunshine was a welcome treat as we peddled the rolling country roads, which reminded me of Tuscany, Italy. We zipped through Kotli, an abandoned riverside mill town with cozy cottages. The final climb was out-of-the saddle steep, and my belly growled as we approached our lunch destination in the village of Hum. With less than 20 residents, it's the world's smallest town. We sat at a long wooden table on the breezy terrace of Humska Konoba, a traditional restaurant overlooking the bucolic landscape. The creamy corn soup had sweet kernels of local corn and my egg white omelet overflowed with tiny, tiny, wild asparagus. They packed the flavor intensity of a scrappy small dog that thinks he's a Great Dane. It was delicious. Afterwards, we toured the quaint town, sampling local and grappa - a pleasant theme of the trip - and then continued peddling 15 km toward Rocko Poje, en route back to Roc. To celebrate a fun day, we kicked up our weary legs atop the nearby stonewall town of Motovun, and sipped a bright, lively Istrian Malvasia and admired the stunning panoramic view of the farmland and vineyards in the Mirna Valley below."

The ceremony, the first of two for the couple, was held in the bride's home country of Germany; on Saturday, the couple will hold a religious ceremony in the South of France for 350 guests, reports Hello!.But the Luxembourg royal gang was out in full force for this intimate gathering. Felix's parents, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa, were there, as were his four siblings, Prince Guillaume, Prince Louis, Princess Alexandra and Prince Sébastien. Also in attendance: Prince Louis' wife, Princess Tessy of Luxembourg, and their two sons, Prince Gabriel and Prince Noah. Prince Guillaume's wife, Princess Stephanie of Luxembourg, was also there, probably feeling a bit of nostalgia: She and Guillaume were married in their own royal ceremony just 11 months ago, complete with a gown with a 13-foot train (for the bride, of course) and a glitzy reception at the Grand Ducal Palace in Luxembourg. Today's celebration for Felix and Claire was more low-key, it being the civil ceremony. The bride wore a simple white peplum dress with cap sleeves, and the groom added a pop of color to his suit with a red tie. In fact, the pair looked so good together, we're considering the merits of a knee-length peplum wedding dress ourselves...See the happy couple!More photos here:Want more?

But a new study in the Journal of Happiness Studies has concluded that the happiness gap is getting smaller.Looking at data from the General Social Survey, which tracked Americans' self-reported happiness from 1972-2008, researchers found that single moms reported being considerably less happy than other female respondents each year. However, the difference between their respective happiness levels has decreased since 1972.Why are single moms less happy in general? According to John Ifcher, one of the study's authors and an assistant professor of economics at Santa Clara University, it has to do with their relationship status.“The fact that they’re single seems to explain a lot of why they’re less happy,” he told the Los Angeles Times.There are several explanations for the narrowing gap. For one, single moms' happiness levels have increased while other women have reported lower happiness levels, said study co-author Homa Zarghamee, an assistant professor of economics at Barnard College. Additionally, Ifcher and Zarghamee speculated that there is less of a stigma associated with single parenting, and increasing numbers of women are choosing to have babies on their own, which may also contribute to the narrowing gap.In May 2013, Census data showed that 62 percent of women between the ages 20 and 24 who had recently given birth were unmarried.Click through the slideshow below for even more fascinating divorce research.Keep in touch!

But the relationship is not one-way. A generous, thoughtful and trusting collaboration between home and school is the best way to achieve the school year you are hoping for.",2013-09-17,"1. If you want to talk to me about a problem, schedule a morning appointment, when I'm fresh.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a66d8c1300002b00939727.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Every year, when I drive to work on the first day of school, I cross paths with families on their way to new beginnings. Most are not heading to my classroom, but they could be. I see the emotion and expectation on their faces -- kids who are anxious about their new classes and parents, quietly hoping that that their child will be understood, nurtured and appreciated. It's humbling that they are trusting my colleagues and me to make that happen. Seeing them reminds me of the unspoken contract between teachers and our students' parents. I hope they know how seriously I take their trust -- and my job.And, while we're at it, there are some other important things I want them to know.1. This year is not going to be perfect, but that is OK. There are things you should not try to ""fix."" There is a solid chance that I am not the teacher that you were imagining for your child. Maybe you have reservations about my ""job share,"" the large amount of reading and writing assigned in my class, or the small amount of homework (to make space for more reading). Maybe you are fine with me, but the class is loaded with ""all the loud sporty boys"" and your son is an introverted naturalist. Like any attentive parent, you are worried that he will have a horrible year. It's hard to resist the impulse to ""fix"" problems for our children, but sometimes we need to. Challenges and problem-solving can help build resiliency, and there may be times when I push your child out of his comfort zone. Learning to deal with discomfort builds his coping skills. As your child continues his educational journey, not all of his teachers or classes will be perfect matches. No parent wants to raise a ""hothouse flower."" Therefore, it is critical that your child experience less than ideal situations -- mostly so he knows he can. 2. Sometimes teachers need you to help ""fix"" things. Sounds contradictory, I know, but there are times when parents need to get involved. Even the most experienced and well-intended teachers will not detect all the important issues. For many reasons, and in many ways, students cleverly hide their school struggles from their teachers. We need parents to be our ""extra set of eyes and ears."" If your daughter is melting down at home because of academic or social stresses, we rely on your reports so that we can figure out how to better support her. Maybe there is an upsetting and distracting social dynamic at play or secret bullying taking place at school. We need to strategize solutions with her and intervene if there is a bully. Perhaps your child feels like she can't keep up with workload expectations. She is staying up late, not getting the chance to play or pursue outside interests. Sometimes there are undiagnosed learning issues at play, but if parents disguise the outside supports that are required to complete work at home, those issues might never get identified and addressed.3. When your child makes mistakes (and he will), resist the urge to protect him from the consequences. Sometimes children make bad decisions: they do or say unkind things, they act impulsively, they shirk responsibilities, or they choose not to do their schoolwork or study for tests. When they do, they need to inhabit their choices, even when that might involve painful consequences like poor grades, disciplinary action or a loss of privileges. That is how children learn. Parents who blindly defend their child, based solely on their child's re-telling of the situation, run the risk of being misled. Even worse, they can inadvertently communicate to their child that being caught making a mistake is the problem -- rather than making the mistake itself. When children are allowed to own their failures, they usually become more competent and responsible as a result.4. How you praise your child is very important. Carol Dweck initiated a growing body of research on the impact of different kinds of praise that confirms what teachers regularly observe: Tell your child she is ""smart"" and she will become risk-averse. Her main goal will be to maintain the ""smart"" label so she will become less interested in trying difficult things. But praise her for her effort and she will be more likely to embrace challenges and grapple with tough problems. Effort is within a child's control. Intelligence refers to something that seems fixed and innate and out of their control. Also, the more honest and specific the praise, the better. Praise that identifies what your child has done well offers a road map for continued success. Inflated compliments, aimed at building your child's self-esteem, often have the opposite effect, and they diminish your credibility.5. If you have an issue with a teacher, tell the teacher. Most teachers can handle feedback, particularly if it is respectful and assumes good intentions. I hate to admit it, but I sometimes get things wrong. I want to know if I have unintentionally hurt your child's feelings, made an insensitive assumption or executed a flawed decision. Perhaps he reports that I don't like him. We need to talk. Ideally, if it is your child's issue, you should encourage him to speak directly with the teacher. But sometimes a complex issue requires an adult communicator. Every teacher has his or her preferred mode of communication, but if something is irritating or upsetting you, we want a chance to address the issue before you complain to other parents or our supervisors.Teaching is obviously a messy, complicated business -- and one that most teachers take very seriously. You entrust us with your children for the school year and we are honored. But the relationship is not one-way. A generous, thoughtful and trusting collaboration between home and school is the best way to achieve the school year you are hoping for.Also on HuffPost:"

The centenarian made time for fun. According to Guinness,2013-09-17,"This photo provided by Guinness World Records shows 112 year-old Salustiano Sanchez-Blazquez. Guinness World Records says the former musician and coal miner certified as the world's oldest man has died. Sanchez-Blazquez was 112. Guinness consultant Robert Young says Sanchez-Blazquez died Friday Sept. 13,2013 at a nursing home in Grand Island, N.Y. (AP Photo/Guiness World Records, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d840b2500003300367e07.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A banana and a daily dose of six Anacin tablets are what 112-year-old Salustiano ""Shorty"" Sanchez-Blazquez attributed to his (very) long life. Born June 8, 1901, in village of El Tejado de Bejar, Spain, the father of two and grandfather of many passed away this Friday, Sept. 13, leaving behind some important life lessons, whether he knew it or not. While certainly a healthy habit, the fruit-eating ritual isn't the only thing that contributed to Sanchez's long and happy life. Below, find a few guidelines for living the good life, extracted from the life of this impressive man who lived quite a long one. Be passionately curious. The centenarian was fascinated by the dulzaina, a double-reed wind instrument in the oboe family, which he taught himself to play. And he didn't keep this passion to himself: Shorty shared his love for the instrument and performed at weddings and celebrations in Spain. Have some humility. When asked how he felt to earn the title of world's oldest living man, Sanchez said he didn't feel accomplished for being older than most. While there are some tried and true tactics for aging gracefully, his perspective on aging may have added candles to his cake. One study found that our attitudes about aging may affect longevity: Dreading the inevitable tick of father time fared worse for long lives.Find love and hold on to it. Sanchez, who married his wife, Pearl, in 1934 must have had an inkling that true love is one of the keys to happiness. The Harvard Grant Study, which followed a group of 268 Harvard males for 75 years, revealed that love is really all that matters when if comings to living a meaningful life. Discover the hobbies that make you light up -- and stick with them.  The centenarian made time for fun. According to Guinness World Records, Sanchez found respite in ""gardening, crossword puzzles and nightly gin rummy games with friends."" His green thumb may have attributed to his 100+ years: Gardening has been shown to relieve stress, improve depression symptoms and connects people to the earth -- which has spiritual rewards.And even if Sanchez's card games ever got heated (which, one might imagine they would), the ritual of socializing with his pals most likely contributed to an enriching sense of purpose and well-being.

These are places where, yes, pockets of anti-American/anti-Western sentiment do exist and where there could possibly be some sort of incident over the next few months. Of course, the same is true of certain neighborhoods in London and Paris. And New York City too, for that matter.So here's what I'm telling most of these travelers: I'm headed to Morocco myself in November. Go ahead and travel. Just be smart about it. How? Read on.Shortly after September 11, 2001, I went to Turkey on assignment for Condé Nast Traveler to test how to travel safely in a Muslim country. In 2006, when the United States was at war with Iraq (like Syria, a Muslim country bordering Turkey), I went again to southeastern Turkey, spending a week close to both the Syria and Iraq borders. I've traveled through Syria as well -- with no guide, in a rental car that I drove myself -- and I've also traveled in Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and the West Bank. (And let me just add that most people you meet in Syria, Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon are unbelievably friendly, hospitable, and generous. In Syria, had my rental car broken down on the road, the next person passing by would have invited me for coffee in his home with his family while he fixed the car.)So, while I'm no counterterrorism expert, I think I'm in a position to suggest a few smart things that travelers headed to uncertain areas can do, say, carry, and wear.  See Also: Why You Should Care About the New 787 routes To make sure that my advice is up-to-date, I spoke with Dan Richards, CEO of Global Rescue, a security-services and medical-evacuation company that gets travelers out of harm's way in times of crisis -- say, if a government declaration says you should leave the country -- and that I myself have a membership with and have recommended to friends and relatives. According to Richards, the only change since the War in Iraq, in terms of recommended precautions for travelers to take, is that better and cheaper technology exists today for maintaining your ability to communicate in an emergency.Should you get caught in an incident, you can easily lose the ability to communicate by cell phone, says Richards. ""Cell-phone capability is typically unavailable because cell phone towers have been destroyed or are blocked, so people who would normally rely on their smartphones can't use them."" Internet access could be unavailable as well. So it's wise to carry a communication device that does not depend on Internet or cell-phone technology. Richards recommends either an Iridium satellite phone -- today you can rent one for about $50 per week -- or a DeLorme inReach satellite messenger device, which allows two-way text messaging by satellite with anyone anywhere in the world. Should a crisis occur, even if you have Internet access, Richards does not recommend relying on Twitter. ""The problem with Twitter is the amount of misinformation that gets tweeted,"" says Richards. ""The information is only as good as the source you're getting it from.""The likelihood that any individual traveler would get caught in an incident is, of course, extremely low. Do not confuse the probability of an anti-Western incident happening in a country you're visiting with the probability that it will happen to you. Also keep in mind that some spots are more precarious than others. ""Most likely we will be in a quiet period until we see what develops. If there is a U.S. strike, in Israel there is a very real possibility of increased activity,"" says Richards. ""Turkey is very different. Turkey would more likely be impacted by demonstrations and civil unrest, whereas Israel could be the recipient of increasing rocket attacks and acts of terrorism.""Read Wendy's tips for staying safe amidst anti-Western sentiment hereMore from Condé Nast Traveler: The Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities in the World Snap Up These Best Fall Travel Values We Dare You to Walk Across these Bridges Beautiful Hidden Beaches Around the World "

I love that a place so royal, regal and right could birth the most rebellious trends with such long-lasting impact on global pop culture, whether it be the Beatles, Clash, Sex Pistols or Vivienne Westwood.I guess one shouldn't be too surprised that restraint leads to resistance and revolt. The Catholic schools always produced the wildest kids, at least where I lived. When things get tough, the tough get...creative.And then there's the perpetual drizzle and grey and fog that hangs around like that negative friend you can't shake. It pisses people off. And so the colors come aggressively: bright reds and pinks, plaids, neons, prints.Coincidentally, I have just moved to the ""London"" of San Francisco, up in Golden Gate Heights, a very foggy part of the city. And damn if it hasn't made me want more color around me.And so with this all close to my heart, I devour all that London Fashion Week has to offer. Much of it would look ridiculous on me riding Muni on my way to anywhere. But I don't care. It's fun and inspiring and entertaining and right now, that's all I need. And a few Sharpies.So as I continue to organize my old clothes into my new closet up in the clouds, I'm pushing colors to the front, as a big ""Fuck You"" to the fog, my homage to London and Punks. Let's all follow London's lead and give fog, or anything dark and depressing and dull, the finger. Turns out it feels pretty great."
