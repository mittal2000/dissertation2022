A study published by the New England Journal of Medicine showed that men who took the daily antiretroviral pill Truvada significantly reduced their risk of contracting HIV. (Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafc6522100000001c70630.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The debate over pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) -- the daily use of the antiretroviral medication Truvada in conjunction with other prevention measures to avoid HIV infection -- has been raging for a few years now. However, in recent weeks the back-and-forth over this little blue pill has reached a fever pitch, with pundits, health providers, and patients expressing rather entrenched opinions on a matter that is still laden with many unanswered questions. As a primary-care physician with a particular focus on HIV/AIDS, I find that the issue of PrEP frequently comes up in my conversations with patients, revealing that many gay men are still scratching their heads over whether this intervention is right for them. The most recent dispute over PrEP was initially sparked by a mainstream piece by the Associated Press (AP) earlier this month. The author delved deeply into this volatile debate in the gay community, billing it as our ""Truvada conundrum."" Notably, AIDS Healthcare Foundation President Michael Weinstein struck a nerve with many gay men, with some even calling for his resignation, after he was quoted in the AP article saying, ""If something comes along that's better than condoms, I'm all for it, but Truvada is not that. Let's be honest: It's a party drug.""While there is much to unpack in Weinstein's statement, he provided a necessary counterpoint to this discussion, which to date has been largely unbalanced in favor of expanded PrEP use among gay men -- with those offering a different, cautionary perspective being unfairly branded as sex-negative or ignorant of the realities of sex among gay men today. Andrew Sullivan has weighed in heavily on the matter alongside several other writers, including Michael Lucas, a well-known gay erotica producer. Many of these pieces have been thoughtful, often first-hand accounts of the author's experience with PrEP. However, in a singular voice the commentary has overwhelmingly bemoaned the slow adoption of this new and promising intervention by gay men and framed the debate as a missed opportunity to eradicate HIV -- posing the questions ""'Why on earth are [gay men] hesitating?'"" and ""Why are we not 'shouting from the roof tops' about this new 'wonder drug'?"" I would offer that there is plenty of reason at least to hesitate, that many important details have been glossed over in the recent discussion about PrEP, and that the relatively meager uptake of PrEP by gay men is perhaps prudent -- an appropriate response in light of the many unanswered questions that remain about its use in the real world. Most of us with an opinion on the matter are quite aware of the sexual reality of gay men and are equally concerned about the increasing rates of HIV transmission within our community. However, some take issue with PrEP because of the reasonable concerns that it misses the point on why HIV continues to spread among men who have sex with men (MSM) and might distract us from many other worrisome sexually transmitted diseases such syphilis and multi-drug-resistant gonorrhea, which continue to spread rapidly within our community. Also troubling is how the discussion to date has both overstated what we know about the effectiveness of PrEP and repeatedly mischaracterized it as a simple once-a-day blue pill, when in reality it involves so much more. PrEP was studied as a complete ""prevention package"" that entailed rigorous monthly risk-reduction counseling, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, provision of condoms, and regular safety lab work. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations detailed this ""prevention package"" in its interim guidance issued for PrEP use in 2012. However, if you look at the recent debate, you will find repeated suggestion that PrEP be used in lieu of condoms, since gay men are just going to have bareback sex anyway. The ultimate concern is not that gay men would be unable to adhere faithfully to the daily dosing regimen and otherwise use PrEP as it was intended under a health provider's care. Rather, it is a fear that some of us -- for one reason or another -- simply will not do so, and that some might indeed use Truvada as a ""party drug,"" taken like candy before crystal meth binges or indiscriminate bareback sex parties. That said, it is clear that many responsible gay men already take PrEP because they are in a serodiscordant relationship or some other ""high-risk"" situation, know the risks associated, agree to the regular checkups and lab work, and have made a conscious decision with their provider. But with all of this excitement over PrEP, we still risk blinding ourselves to the pervasive HIV stigma still rampant in our community. Arguably, for some PrEP may even worsen stigma by further absolving both HIV-positive and HIV-negative gay men of the responsibility to openly discuss their status -- because why bother if everyone is taking his pills? The hope is that PrEP instead fosters a more open conversation, evidenced by how this recent debate has much engaged the community. Time will tell whether the PrEP effect will open up the discussion about HIV among gay men or silence us further.Silence is dangerous, as it only fuels the further spread of the disease. And while Andrew Sullivan is ""aghast at attempts to stigmatize [PrEP],"" equating Weinstein's comments to the often-cited ""Truvada Whore"" meme (a term I'm convinced is born from an ironic and provocative way to confront stigma rather than perpetuate it), the resulting debate has forced us to talk openly about many of the concerns that still underlie PrEP. That conversation only gives us strength in the face of HIV and should not be stifled. Fighting amongst ourselves does nothing to advance the discussion and bring greater clarity to ending HIV. Weinstein's comments about Truvada being a ""party drug"" may have been flippant and imprecise, but in that sense he is no guiltier than those who flatly promote PrEP as ""90- to 99-percent effective"" without clarifying that such rates of risk reduction are hypothetical -- obtained from a subsequent subgroup analysis that cherry-picked only those cases that were able to fully adhere to their dosing. The ""99 percent"" figure came from the later STRAND study in which men were directly observed taking their medication on a daily basis. Neither of these scenarios reflects reality. In truth, the original iPrEx study, on which the FDA recommendations for PrEP use in MSM were made, demonstrated that adherence among gay men was actually quite dismal when they were left to their own devices. As such, while many advocates for broader use of PrEP scoff at the notion that gay men might struggle with daily drug compliance, the iPrEx study's findings throw water in the face of their claim. Importantly, in the wake of the FDA recommendation, the CDC expressed caution about PrEP, stating that ""sexual risk behavior and adherence ... among MSM taking [Truvada] for PrEP outside of a trial setting, and with awareness of trial results, might be different from what was observed for men in the iPrEx trial.""And that difference may have a profound impact not just for the individuals taking PrEP but for the rest of us as well. PrEP holds tremendous promise, but its true impact in the real world -- whether ultimately positive, negative, or equivocal -- has yet to be elucidated. In the meantime, we bear the onus of seeking a more realistic perspective on PrEP, making a decision informed by the evidence but also tempered by reservation when evidence is lacking. And so far, despite some overzealous writers suggesting that most every HIV-negative gay man get with the PrEP program, the evidence does not support such a blanket recommendation.Instead of speculating about the impact of PrEP, we should promote further discussion and focus on educating each other about the intervention and what questions about it still remain. The righteous anger aimed at forcing Weinstein to renege on his statements and resign from his post distracts from this effort. Just consider that for many of us, Weinstein's statement does not apply, while for some it certainly may. Silencing that discussion denies gay men their human fallibility and may provide cover for the flagrant misuse of PrEP to justify irresponsible behavior. So let's take a breath, save our indignation for ourselves, and critically examine the use of PrEP in the real world. In this vein, I'm encouraged to see websites such as PrEPwatch.org and My PrEP Experience that aim both to inform and tap into the authentic, shared experiences of those using PrEP. This is an exciting time, and PrEP represents very promising progress in the prevention of HIV. We owe it to ourselves and future generations of gay men not to squander but to seize the opportunity that PrEP offers to prevent further transmission of HIV, while also mitigating its potential risks. So let's work together to get the word out about PrEP and engage in the debate, but in a more balanced, accurate, and incremental way that is informed by the evidence as it comes."

For his Carpe Diem debut the Swiss-American lute player Peter Croton plays a collection of ricercares and fantasias by the Italian lutenist-composers Francesco Spinacino and Francesco da Milano. The 15th century saw the lute emerge as a solo instrument, and the terms ricercar and fantasia were used for works created without preexisting models, improvisation being expected to drive the performance the way jazz does today.

3,GREEN,The Time for Wind and Solar Energy Is Now,"Elliott Negin, ContributorSenior Writer, Union of Concerned Scientists",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-time-for-wind-and-sol_b_5208289.html,Renewables are now a lot cheaper and better than they were when the last IPCC report came out seven years ago. It's time to put them to use.,2014-04-25,2014-04-24-windmillssolarpanelspalmspringsgettyimages.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-24-windmillssolarpanelspalmspringsgettyimages-thumb.jpg,"The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report, which explores ways to cut carbon emissions, put the world on notice. Despite efforts in the United States, Europe and developing countries such as China to ramp up energy efficiency and renewable energy, global carbon emissions have been increasing at a much faster clip than they were just a few decades ago. To avoid the worst of the worst, IPCC scientists say emissions will have to be reduced 40 percent to 70 percent by 2050 and warn that we only have a 15-year window to reverse course.""We cannot afford to lose another decade,"" said Ottmar Edenhofer, a German economist who co-chaired the committee that wrote the report. ""If we lose another decade, it becomes extremely costly to achieve climate stabilization.""As Edenhofer points out, the cost of doing nothing likely would dwarf whatever we might spend today to address climate change. That said, it makes the most sense to replace fossil fuels with the most cost-effective, safest, carbon-free and low-carbon options that can be deployed as quickly as possible.For the biggest source of U.S. carbon pollution -- electric utilities -- the best solution is wind, solar and other renewable energy technologies, which, according to the new IPCC report, ""have achieved a level of technical and economic maturity to enable deployment at a significant scale."" In other words, renewables are now a lot cheaper and better than they were when the last IPCC report came out seven years ago.Nuclear Not EconomicWhat about nuclear power? Although it now provides the most carbon-free electricity in the country, without a national carbon tax or cap-and-trade program, it's not economic, even with more than 50 years of generous federal subsidies. Over the last decade, the estimated price tag for a new reactor has skyrocketed, jumping from $2 billion in 2002 to as high as $12 billion today. Wall Street won't finance a project unless Uncle Sam co-signs the loan, which leaves taxpayers on the hook if a project fails. So while Southern Company and its partners, with the help of an $8.3 billion federally guaranteed loan, are building two new reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant site in Georgia, it's unlikely the industry will be able to muster more than two or three more in the next decade. As recently as five years ago, utilities applied for licenses to build more than 25 new reactors.At the same time the nuclear industry's hoped-for renaissance has fizzled, older reactors are shutting down. Four reactors closed last year because of prohibitively expensive safety upgrades or competition from cheaper energy sources, namely natural gas and wind. Economics will close a fifth reactor, Vermont Yankee, this fall, and the nation's largest nuclear plant operator, Exelon, said in February that unless market conditions improve, it will announce plant closings by the end of this year. Wind, Solar More AffordableUnlike new reactors, the cost of solar and wind has dropped dramatically. Solar panel prices have plummeted more than 75 percent since 2008, and the cost of generating electricity from wind turbines declined more than 40 percent over the past three years, sparking a construction boom. Last year, solar installations in the United States amounted to a record 5.1 gigawatts, boosting the national total to nearly 13 gigawatts -- enough to power nearly 2.2 million typical American homes. And by the end of December, there were enough wind turbines across the country to power 15.5 million homes and cut annual electric power sector carbon emissions by 4.4 percent. Given solar and wind's exponential growth, experts see tremendous potential. The Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), for example, projects that wind and solar could produce 15 percent of U.S. electricity by 2020, 27 percent by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050.Still, naysayers harp on the fact that wind and solar power are intermittent. The sun doesn't always shine, they say, and the wind doesn't always blow. That may be true, but it's not a deal-breaker. Studies by NREL and electricity grid operators in the United States and Europe conclude that larger contributions from solar and wind would not create significant technological problems or impose higher costs.""Meeting demand in the face of variability and uncertainty is old hat for grid operators,"" said Mike Jacobs, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) who used to work at NREL. ""They're already doing it with wind and solar here in the United States and in Europe.""Besides, spreading wind and solar installations over a large enough area would help address the intermittency issue,"" he added. ""The wind is always blowing somewhere, and if we increased the percentage of wind and solar to 30 percent -- which we should be able to do within the next 15 years -- the system's flexibility to manage supply and demand, along with a updated grid, should be able to integrate that power.""Renewables Provide More ResilienceRamping up renewables not only would cut carbon emissions, it also would diversify the national electricity system and make it more resilient, according to a new UCS report. That system -- which includes power plants, transmission lines and fuel delivery networks -- was not designed to withstand all of today's extreme weather events, many of which have been linked to climate change. Sea level rise, for example, threatens nearly 100 coastal electricity facilities, including power plants and substations, the UCS report found. Water temperature and availability also pose major problems. Older coal, natural gas and nuclear power plants rely on a ""once-through"" cooling process that draws hundreds of millions, if not billions, of gallons of water daily from the closest water body. When that river, lake or ocean gets too hot, which is happening with greater frequency, the plants have to cut back production or shut down temporarily. Likewise, droughts can substantially reduce water availability, while flooding from extreme rainfall can overwhelm a plant, as it did in June 2011 when a record-breaking Missouri River flood forced the Fort Calhoun nuclear plant near Omaha to remain shut down after a scheduled refueling outage two months earlier.Renewables don't suffer from the same limitations. Rooftop solar panels and wind turbines, for instance, rely on smaller, more distributed units, which make it less likely that extreme weather events would have the same dramatic impact. Moreover, renewables are less vulnerable to drought and heat because they don't require water.Let's Stop Subsidizing Fossil FuelsTo get where we need to go, the federal government has to turn its outdated energy subsidy policy on its head. The oil and gas industry has been enjoying average annual subsidies and tax breaks of $4.86 billion in today's dollars since 1918, according to a 2011 analysis by DBL Investors, a venture capital firm. The nuclear industry, DBL found, benefited from an average of $3.5 billion a year in subsidies from 1947 to 1999. And coal, which has been getting federal and state subsidies since the early 1800s, currently receives at least $3.2 billion a year, according to a 2011 Harvard study. Renewables, on the other hand, averaged only $370 million a year in subsidies between 1994 and 2009, according to DBL. The 2009 stimulus package did provide $21 billion for renewables, but that support barely began to balance the scales that still tilt toward fossil fuels. Just last December, for example, Congress allowed a key wind industry tax break to expire, but it continues to support massive subsidies for coal, oil and gas. Americans represent less than 5 percent of the world's population, but we're responsible for 19 percent of the world's carbon emissions. Despite the fact that China surpassed us as the world's top carbon emitter in 2006, we're still the worst offenders per capita. So after subsidizing coal for more than 200 years and oil and gas for nearly 100 -- which inadvertently got us into this mess -- it's long past time to take fossil fuels off the dole and go all out to promote renewables. Fifteen years is just around the corner.Elliott Negin is the director of news and commentary at the Union of Concerned Scientists."
4,RELIGION,An Inside Track To Sainthood?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/papal-sainthood-rules_n_5208244.html,,2014-04-25,"A man walks past posters announcing the double canonisation of Popes John Paul II and John XXIII on April 24, 2014 in Rome. Late popes John Paul II and John XXIII will be made saints at an unprecedented joint ceremony on April 27, 2014 in a bid to unite Catholic conservatives and liberals. The canonisations of two popular popes are set to bring hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to Rome. AFP PHOTO/ Filippo MONTEFORTE (Photo credit should read FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e5e7220000ba01dd3002.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) When Pope Francis canonizes Popes John XXIII and John Paul II on Sunday (April 27), Catholics across the spectrum will have reason to cheer: Liberals credit John with opening the church to the modern world in the 1960s, and conservatives hail John Paul as reasserting orthodoxy after too many innovations.But the unprecedented double-barreled canonization also raises a question that might give both sides pause: Why is Rome making saints of almost every modern pontiff after nearly a millennium when almost no popes were canonized?In the first 500 years of Christianity, the Apostle Peter (considered the first pope by tradition) and 47 of his 48 papal successors were viewed as saints, mainly because so many of them were martyred, which is the simplest route to canonization. Another 30 popes were named saints in the next 500 years, largely based on their reputation for sanctity.But as Kean University’s Christopher Bellitto notes, in the next nine centuries, just three popes became saints. That relative drought ended only in 1954 when Pius X was canonized, 40 years after his death.“If you do have the option of canonizing popes, perhaps their waiting period should be quite long — 50 or even 100 years before starting, with no possibility at all of waiving the delay,” said Bellitto, a church historian, who supports a moratorium on all papal canonizations.The dual canonizations have prompted criticisms that are unusually pointed for prospective saints — and especially for two popes who are generally remembered so fondly.Soon after his death in 2005, John Paul was being hailed as “John Paul the Great,” an honorific given to just two or three other popes in history. And at his funeral, many in the massive crowds held signs demanding “Santo Subito!” or “Sainthood Now!”A little more than a month later, Pope Benedict XVI responded to the outpouring by waiving the standard five-year waiting period before launching a cause for canonization.Yet in recent years, John Paul’s problematic record on the clergy sex abuse scandal has tainted his legacy; on Tuesday (April 22) Vatican officials were forced to defend him during a press conference that was supposed to celebrate the two popes.At the same time, some conservatives are upset that “Good Pope John,” as John XXIII is widely known, is being pushed to sainthood along with John Paul, because they say John’s legacy of reform gravely undermined Catholicism.“It is impossible to speak of sanctity for him,” Roberto de Mattei, a professor of church history at the European University in Rome and a favorite of the Catholic right, said recently.Now, almost every pope in the modern era — starting with Pius IX, the ultra-traditionalist pontiff of the 19th century, and running up through Pius XII (who died in 1958), Paul VI and John Paul I (who reigned for just 33 days in 1978) -– is in the canonization pipeline.What accounts for this sainthood surge?Experts cite a combination of factors. For one, more recent popes have arguably been holy men rather than monarchs, and they look especially good in comparison to the various rogues and warriors who occupied the papal throne in the Renaissance era.“In a sense they are witnesses of a Christian life,” said Massimo Faggioli, a theologian at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota and author of a new biography of John XXIII.Modern popes, Faggioli said, “are less subject to the political and social constraints of established European Catholicism, when to become pope you had to be part of the right family or alliance, and being violent or ruthless or almost a war criminal had no importance.”Today, he said, popes are expected to be saints more than rulers, pastors of a church “that tries to be closer to the gospel than to the Roman Empire.”Another factor: John Paul II was devoted to saints, and he canonized 482 men and women during his 27-year reign, far more than the approximately 300 saints that popes had canonized in the previous six centuries combined.Critics accused John Paul of turning the Vatican into a “saint-making factory,” while others said he was simply democratizing the system. Either way, several popes were beneficiaries of the expansion, including now John Paul himself.But a major reason for the shift is that since the 19th century, popes have become central to Catholic identity in a way that they had not been before. They are both symbols of the faith to the wider world and standard-bearers of one cause or another within the church.The problem, however, is that the drive to make all popes saints means that the process can look political. It also runs the risk of focusing on pontiffs and overlooking other candidates who would be widely accepted as saints — Mother Teresa, for example, who appears stuck at the beatification stage.“Do we put the shine of canonization on only those aspects of a pope’s life that we like but say it doesn’t apply to those we don’t like? And who makes that call?” Bellitto said. “It takes cafeteria Catholicism all along the ideological spectrum to a whole new level.”Moreover, the process can come off as a kind of holy logrolling in which sitting popes canonize their predecessors in expectation that they, too, will be canonized. Benedict XVI — who can’t be up for sainthood because he’s still alive — jump-started the canonization of John Paul, who he worked with for more than 23 years.In the end, the trend could actually backfire if the public assumes that every pontificate comes with an automatic — or at least expected — halo.“Now most of the saints are ‘fast food saints’ and they are quickly forgotten,” Faggioli said. “We will see if these pope-saints will be forgotten, too.”"

""Time to mourn and regroup.""Many expeditions abandoned base camp this week after an April 18 avalanche killed 16 guides who were cracking ice and fixing ropes on the upper reaches of the Khumbu Icefall.The single deadliest disaster on the 8,850-metre (29,035-foot) Himalayan mountain, the incident has shocked the mountaineering community and highlighted the disproportionate risks that Nepali guides run for a few thousand dollars to help foreign climbers reach the summit.Californian mountain guide Adrian Ballinger said that even before the latest avalanches, there had been an exodus of teams from base camp due to the aggressive behaviour of a group of younger sherpas there.He said these sherpas were determined to ensure that no one scaled Everest from the south side during this year's climbing season, which ends around May 25. It would be the first year of no summits since commercial climbs took off in the mid-1990s, though there will be attempts on the north side from Tibet.""I could see fresh avalanches falling at the same spot that was hit last week,"" Ang Tshering Sherpa of the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) said in Kathmandu after returning from base camp. No one was hurt in the latest avalanches as there was no one on the unstable Khumbu Icefall.Ed Marzec, a 67-year-old Californian who had hoped to become the oldest American to scale Everest, said there was a ""crack"" of ice as he was waiting on Thursday for a plane to take him off base camp.""The sherpas say the ice conditions have changed so much and so rapidly, they have created extremely dangerous conditions which prevent finding a safe route to the summit,"" he said in comments emailed by his friend, Daniel Beer. TOO FEW SHERPAS LEFTBallinger told Reuters by phone from Kathmandu that when he left base camp early on Thursday afternoon there were only 40-50 climbers still there hoping to make an ascent. They had a similar number of sherpas, though even they had gone to villages lower down because they felt threatened by other guides.About a week ago there had been more than 600 people there.Two big teams that were still holding out on Thursday later declared their expeditions were over, Arnette said.Tilakram Pandey, an official at Nepal's mountaineering department, said the so-called Icefall Doctors, who are responsible for making routes through the glacier up to Camp 1, would repair the trail for those who wanted to climb.But Ballinger said that with so few sherpas left, it would be virtually impossible to set out.""You need this critical mass of people to keep digging and putting the route back in,"" he said. ""Non-professional recreational climbers ... just don't have the power to push through those conditions without significant sherpa support.""The government said on Thursday it would allow those who pull out after the disaster to return without paying extra fees for permits within five years.The tragedy has provoked criticism that the government takes hefty fees for climbing permits but does little for the guides themselves. This week it gave in to demands from the sherpas to pay compensation to the families of those killed and to raise the minimum insurance cover for guides.Guiding foreign climbers is the main livelihood for sherpas, helping them make up to $8,000 or more each year in a country with an average annual income of just over $700.

A CNN spokeswoman told HuffPost Friday that ""the mayor’s office was never granted editorial control over the content or the press communications for ‘Chicagoland,’ and no agency was ever granted authority to offer the mayor’s office editorial approval for the content or the promotional materials for the series.""But several of the 700 emails the Tribune obtained through an open records request indicated a level of coordination in setting up scenes that wouldn't be expected for a ""non-scripted"" documentary series airing on a news network. They also revealed the production team suggested that increased access to the mayor could result in more favorable coverage.The Tribune published several of the emails, including one in which ""Chicagoland"" producer Marc Levin, seeking more access, told Emanuel’s team that they would show the mayor ""as the star that he really is."" In another, Levin told Emanuel's staff that in order to best highlight the mayor's ""leadership,"" they needed to film him in specific ways, such as on the phone in his SUV and in a meeting with key advisers at City Hall.Several hundred messages between Emanuel staffers were redacted, according to the Tribune. One heavily redacted email includes Emanuel aides discussing potential ""characters"" for the documentary series.Levin and Mark Benjamin, the team behind ""Brick City,"" the Sundance Channel’s series about Newark and its mayor at the time, Cory Booker, gained access to Emanuel in February 2013 through the assistance of a Chicago public relations firm with ties to the mayor, according to the Tribune. In May 2013, CNN announced that it was collaborating with the filmmakers on “Chicagoland,"" with Sundance Productions’ Robert Redford and Laura Michalchyshyn serving as executive producers. Filming wrapped in October and the first episode premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Last month, CNN began airing the series, with the final installment airing Thursday night. The ""Chicagoland"" production team often did not get the access to Emanuel it desired, according to the emails. Levin told the Tribune he was ""eternally frustrated"" by the controlling behavior of the mayor's office.Levin said that “everything the mayor does is stage-managed” and acknowledged that you don’t “get access without having to do a certain dance.” He maintained, however, that the mayor's office did not have editorial control over the series.

Powers/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c602240000310098f0ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the nearly seven years he'd been paying off his student loans, Tom Cimochowski had never sent a late payment to Sallie Mae. But in February, one of the company's debt collectors abruptly told his mother that his loan was in default and he had 30 days to pay up.He was the victim of what federal regulators now call an “auto-default,"" triggered by the death of his grandfather, who co-signed his loan, over a decade earlier.Cimochowski’s mother, who’d been working two jobs since his father died when Cimochowski was in college, panicked because she didn’t have the money. His aunt offered to pay off the debt by taking out a second mortgage on her house. But Cimochowski didn’t understand why Simm Associates, a debt collector, and Sallie Mae suddenly wanted his family to pay $34,017.12 on a loan he’d paid on time every month -- 80 of them -- since May 2007.Over the next week, Cimochowski scoured Internet message boards, bombarded Sallie Mae with phone calls, and peppered his friends in law and finance with questions. He learned that he was among a growing list of borrowers who have been faithfully paying their student loan bills on time for years, only to face the devastating consequences of a default due to the death of the co-signer of their loan.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau this week issued an urgent warning to the public about the dangers posed by auto-defaults, the industry-wide practice of lenders placing borrowers’ private student loans into default simply because the borrower’s co-signer -- often a parent or grandparent -- had died or declared bankruptcy.Sallie Mae, the nation’s largest lender and servicer of private student loans, appears to be among the leading practitioners of auto-defaults, according to consumer complaints. The company often uses Simm Associates, which is based close to Sallie Mae’s Delaware headquarters, to recoup unpaid debt from the estate of borrowers’ dead family members.The CFPB first highlighted the practice in 2012, but its spread throughout the industry and the lengthening list of consumer complaints prompted regulators to warn consumers about its risks and offer sample letters they could send to lenders to stave off financial ruin.“It's the scummiest thing I’ve ever encountered,” said Cimochowski, 30, a certified public accountant. “I can't think of anything worse than using a death in the family to demand money. How low can you go?”The Consumer Bankers Association, an industry trade group, said the practice is rare. But while the CFPB couldn’t say how many borrowers have been affected, the agency has noted that since 2005, the majority of private student loans, or those not guaranteed by the federal government, have had a co-signer, with the share reaching about 90 percent for loans originated in 2010 and 2011. And as co-signers age, there could soon be an additional uptick in the number of borrowers finding themselves in the same situation as Cimochowski.“Over time, we have updated our practice to recognize the personal challenges a customer faces in such a tragic situation,” said Martha Holler, Sallie Mae spokeswoman. “Although the promissory note states that the loan may be declared in default and due and payable in the event of the cosigner’s death, we do not report the loan to the credit bureaus as defaulted unless and until it reaches 211 days of delinquency. Instead we work with the customer to understand his/her ability to make ongoing payments.”Jeff Simendinger, who co-founded Simm Associates in 1991 with his father in their Delaware home’s dining room, said that while he wasn’t aware of Cimochowski’s case, everything his company does is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing debt collection.“I've never come across any accounts that were automatically defaulted based on one of the borrowers expiring,” Simendinger said. “It’s not a practice I've ever seen, and I would be shocked to see an instance like that.”“We pride ourselves on doing the right thing,” Simendinger added. “I’d rather go out of business than have the reputation of going out there breaking laws or doing something unethical.""In interviews, borrowers contacted by Simm Associates said they mostly blamed Sallie Mae for referring their debt to Simm. In its report, the CFPB appeared to focus more on practices by lenders who initiate auto-defaults, rather than debt collectors.During the six-month period ending in March, Sallie Mae for the first time was responsible for the majority of complaints consumers lodged with the CFPB about their private student loans. The company faces numerous government investigations from at least three federal agencies and a half-dozen state attorneys general, ranging from allegations that the company cheated active-duty soldiers to reports that the student loan giant unfairly processed borrowers' monthly payments.Cimochowski’s case offers a rare glimpse into Sallie Mae's apparent practice of automatically placing borrowers' accounts into default.The New Jersey resident enrolled as a freshman at Seton Hall University in fall 2001. His grandfather, who co-signed his loan, died in January 2002. Cimochowski graduated in 2006, and after delaying payment for a year -- typical among recent graduates -- he began repaying the loan in May 2007.Earlier this year, while reviewing his loan documents, Cimochowski decided it was time to request that Sallie Mae remove his dead grandfather from his student loan. The documents contained a clause that allowed him to request that his co-signer be released from the obligation of repaying the debt if he had made a series of on-time payments and met the company’s unspecified underwriting criteria. Since he had paid his bills on time since 2007, he figured that the company would no longer find it necessary for him to have a co-signer -- especially a dead one. What Cimochowski didn’t know then was that his loan agreement, like many others, also contained a separate clause that allowed Sallie Mae to place his loan into default should his co-signer die or declare bankruptcy.Instead of honoring his request, Sallie Mae automatically referred his loan to Simm. A few weeks later, in February, the debt collector called his mother demanding an immediate payment of the full amount. When his mother hesitated, Cimochowski said, the Simm representative threatened to increase the interest rate on the debt.Cimochowski’s experience, according to regulators, is not unusual. Lenders often prevent borrowers from having their co-signers released from their student loans. The death or bankruptcy filing of a co-signer can trigger ruinous consequences for borrowers who have been paying their loans on time for years, such as negative credit reports that make it harder for them to get a job or access loans.“When tragedy triggers an automatic default, responsible borrowers are thrown into financial distress with demands of immediate repayment,” Richard Cordray, the director of the CFPB, said this week. “Lenders should have clear and accessible processes in place to enable borrowers to release co-signers from loans. A borrower should not have to go through an obstacle course.”Rohit Chopra, the agency’s student debt expert, said that auto-defaults may be a symptom of outdated systems that were built to fuel the bundling of private student loans into securities. Otherwise, it doesn’t make much financial sense for companies to demand immediate repayment of a loan that’s being paid off on time. In his report this week, he urged financial industry executives and investors to review the practice.The CFPB said that while the practice isn’t necessarily violating any laws, it does raise questions when borrowers are stymied in their attempts to have their co-signers released from their student loans.Cimochowski complained to the CFPB, and a few days later, Sallie Mae and Simm told him that he could continue repaying his student loan on a monthly basis, just like he had been for the past six years. They also apologized.But Cimochowski said he’s been scarred by the experience, and even though his Sallie Mae loans carry interest rates roughly between 3 to 5 percent -- a relatively low rate -- he’s looking to refinance with another lender. “I will pay more money every month just to get away from Sallie Mae,” Cimochowski said. “I do not want to be involved with that company.”"

(AP Photo)ua",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5babe3b92500003600375236.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Godzilla is about to re-emerge from the oceanic depths, this time to wreck 3D havoc on San Francisco. Monsters as we all know are merely metaphors. As Freud taught us, they are the Id let loose upon the world. Or as Jung taught us, they are archetypes reemerging from the mists. Or as cultural studies departments have taught us, they are personifications of Cold War anxieties, consumerist appetites, climate change dread, or other social and political fears. The new Godzilla, arrives with a murky trailer that suggests that heartless, over-reaching scientists are somehow to blame. Godzilla is now three times as tall as the 160-foot dinosaur who first stomped across the screen in 1954. Along with the monster's increased physical stature comes a restoration in ""seriousness."" At least so says the director Gareth Edwards, who sought to recapture the moral urgency of the original, which he believed has dwindled over the years of camp sequels and re-makes. Godzilla first splashed ashore on Odo Island in Ishiro Honda's black and white movie as Japan was still recovering from the devastation of the war. At nearly the same time on the other side of the world, Samuel Beckett's two-act Waiting for Godot debuted in Paris-- in January 1953 at the aptly named Théâtre de Babylone. Godot, of course, was no monster, but Godzilla and Godot have more in common than a first syllable. They are the two opposing faces of despair: a god that is pure wrath and a god that never shows up. Both emanate from the devastation of World War II. Godzilla is an ancient creature scarred by atomic radiation and driven to his rampage by nuclear testing. Those details are decorously omitted in the drastically re-edited American version in which Raymond Burr is bizarrely spliced into the action: Godzilla, King of the Monsters (1956). Godot sustains the hopes of Vladimir and Estragon, the querulous pals who pass the time in the play's barren, existential landscape. Godzilla is all noise, from thunderous footfall to his metallic scream. Godot is entirely silent except for a cryptic message sent by a boy at the end of each act. When Vladimir asks the boy what Godot does, he answers, ""He does nothing, sir."" If we had to choose between these two worlds, which would be better? The dread of sheer destruction let loose upon humanity? Or the dread of meaninglessness in an indifferent universe? Which is worse, malevolence or void? W. H. Auden commented in a late poem:But indifference is the leastWe have to fear from man or beast.The terror of a universe that takes notice of us with active dislike seems to strike most people these days as the more unsettling alternative. Our cinematic nightmares are populated with menaces such as zombies, vampires, ravenous aliens, killer clowns, and really big critters, and not so much with Pinteresque non sequiturs and hopeless stares into the empty horizon. There was, of course, Lost in Translation. But the Godot-dämmerung isn't filling up the cineplex these days.My stock-in-trade is writing about higher education. As head of the National Association of Scholars that is pretty much all I do, day in and day out, and I write from the perspective of someone committed to traditional academic values, such as the rational search for truth. In other words, I'm as good a candidate as one might find for the Godot side of the equation: a connoisseur of hopeless waiting for something that will probably never arrive. And yet really I am on the side of the monsters, at least the big tail-dragging ones with large underbites. They seem so sadly out of place in a universe designed for smaller things, and their rage is so unequal to the perplexities of the world. Godzilla may tower over the TransAmerica Pyramid, but he cowers under the Higg's Boson. As a metaphor he is up for grabs. The current movie probably casts him as nature-defying-the-planet-despoiling-scientists. But, if so, that's just playing along with popular prejudice. I prefer to think of Godzilla as the modern university, grown way too large and unwieldy to live in this world. He is, for sure, mostly appetite and expects us to see to his needs. Why? That's just the way he is. Ferocious, easily peeved, entitled. Godzilla concentrates all the forces of contemporary pantheism, earth-worship, and anti-humanism that are by far the most powerful quasi-religious sentiment on campus. Godot is at best a spokesman for the nouveau atheism that has emerged in recent years with its own ""chaplains"" on some campuses. Of course, I don't insist on my interpretation. I am, however, hankering for the epic battle to come: Godzilla vs. Godot. What happens when irresistible existential rage meets immovable existential indifference?"

Now that the two nations have reaffirmed their longstanding alliance, including a commitment by the U.S. to Japan's defense of the Senkaku Islands, I would like even more strongly to press for my suggestion that Mr. Abe to pay his respects at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial in Hawaii. This is because the gap in understanding between Japan and the U.S. remains a deep one, despite Mr. Obama's visit.It's not the first time for me to make this suggestion. Starting from August 2005, on the 60th anniversary of the end of the War in East Asia, when I ran an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, I have continued to propose that the president of the United States and the prime minister of Japan take part in mutual gestures of reconciliation, with the former visiting the Hiroshima Peace Park and the latter visiting the USS Arizona Memorial, to lay commemorative wreaths. Such acts would serve to bring historical closure to memories of that tragic war.But this time, I've reached my wit's end, and here's why: Last December Prime Minister Abe, in disregard of warnings from the U.S., went to worship at the Yasukuni Shrine. The American Embassy in Tokyo promptly issued a statement expressing its ""disappointment,"" and that was followed by similar remarks from the State Department and White House -- an extraordinary response toward an allied country. Since that time, the sense of discord between the U.S. and Japan has gradually increased. It's ironic that while the Abe government has been pushing for a revision of its interpretation of collective self-defense in order to solidify the U.S.-Japan alliance, Abe's Yasukuni visit worked to destabilize it.Certainly in the United States, some voices were raised in objection to the Obama Administration's actions, asserting that they constituted ""interference in the matter of Yasukuni, which is a Japanese domestic problem."" Nonetheless, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued a report on February 20, 2014, which remarked "". . . the fact that Abe chose to ignore U.S. advice with the surprise visit may have breached a degree of trust between the capitals."" A majority of leaders and the media were critical of Abe's move, irrespective of their party affiliations. To break this deadlock, I would now once again propose that the time is more ripe than ever for Mr. Abe to engage in ""breakthrough diplomacy"" by visiting the USS Arizona Memorial and making a floral offering -- an act that has yet to be performed by any of Abe's predecessors as currently serving prime minister in the 69 years since the war ended. Mr. Obama himself has said on several occasions that he would ""like to visit Hiroshima."" Presently that won't be realized this time as his itinerary has been shortened to make time to visit South Korea, so I would suggest Prime Minister Abe make the initial move and break the ice toward achieving a fundamental reconciliation. Despite the situation in which the concept and wording of the term ""Japan-U.S. alliance"" continues to be waved as the accepted standard in both Japanese and American public opinion, if we were to scratch the surface, serious concerns and discord can be found on the U.S. side.  * Chinese and Koreans might become angered  In particular, from the start of this year, Mr. Abe's appointments of the new NHK chairman and members of board of governors, as well as aides and advisors, have also led to the ""disappointment"" by the U.S. government. And repeated remarks espousing the view by right wingers, to the effect that the International Military Tribunal for the Far East ""enabled the U.S. to downplay such terrible massacres as the firebombing of Tokyo or the dropping of two atomic bombs"" has had the effect of further alienating even Republicans and other conservatives in the U.S. Mr. Abe, moreover, has downplayed the problems that such remarks have created by brushing them off as having been ""personal viewpoints,"" and while in a few cases the offending statements were retracted, no one was asked to resign, resulting in further discord.  One of my American friends made the rather caustic comment to the effect that, for a member of the NHK board of governors to completely repudiate the judgments of the Tokyo tribunal struck him as reflecting a desire by the Abe government to rewrite the postwar relationship between Japan and the U.S. from the ground up.  The biggest test was the assertion that worshipping at Yasukuni (in Abe's words) was a pledge ""never to wage war again,"" and that ""mourning for war dead is an act performed by the leaders of all the world's nations."" But the reality is that Mr. Abe's logic failed to convince not only China and South Korea, but even the U.S.  The reason for this is deeply rooted. Despite Japan's agreement to accept the rulings of the Tokyo Tribunal in accordance with Article 11 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1952, the Yasukuni Shrine consecrated 14 war criminals convicted by the tribunal. In addition at the ""Yushukan"" historical museum adjacent to the Yasukuni shrine, displays uphold the argument that the Pacific War was fought in self defense; glorify the Shimpu Tokkotai (Kamikaze pilots); and make scant references to the destruction wrought by Japan in China and other Asian nations. This would invalidate any claims that worship there is akin to acts ""shared around the world"" for the purpose of mourning those killed in wars.  About 10 years ago, at the time the Bush administration launched the second Gulf War, a well-known neoconservative columnist requested me to show him the Yushukan museum, and I recall his remarks: ""I can see why Chinese and Koreans would be upset. It's unpleasant for me as well,"" he said.  At the end of January, while meeting the press at the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Abe was asked a question regarding the possibility of a clash between Japan and China over the disputed Senkaku Islands, and he arbitrarily used the analogy of relations between Great Britain and Germany on the eve of World War I. Abe's response was conspicuous in its singularity. In response to the media's reaction to his comments the prime minister's Office brushed off it off by insisting it was the ""fault of the simultaneous interpreter, who had added words that Abe did not actually say.""  But this year, on the 100th anniversary of the beginning of World War I, for the prime minister to stand before a podium in the center of Europe and attempt to trace a line between the current Sino-Japan relationship and the scars of Europe made many people raise their eyebrows in doubt, and had the result of pushing aside the successes of ""Abenomics"" that Abe had come to flaunt as the main speaker at this year's event.  Dr. Henry Kissinger was the first American leader to point out the similarities between the current relationship between the US and China and that of Great Britain and Germany on the eve of World War I. In particular he expressed deep concern over the possibility of a clash, and to prevent that from occurring, as part of his analysis he took up the theme of policies aimed at prevention. For such a concern to be raised in terms of Sino-Japanese relations led one American scholar to raise the alarm by ironically noting, ""Doesn't it seem that Abe's diplomacy vis-a-vis China has the aim of making Japan the lead contender in Asia?""  At the very least, one result of Abe's diplomatic posture had led China to launch a vehement worldwide campaign criticizing the positions of the Abe government, to the effect that Japan ""Has yet to repent for its past incursions."" Meanwhile South Korea's president Park Geun-hye has not budged on her hard positions concerning the ""comfort women"" and other issues, with China and South Korea strengthening their ties to foster a joint anti-Japan policy, making it one of the greatest concerns for the Obama administration.  After the inauguration of the second Abe cabinet, Japan has yet to hold even a single summit meeting with neighboring China or South Korea, and the tension in their relations continues. Following this to its logical conclusion, China and South Korea have detected a cold draft flowing between the U.S. and Japan, which has resulted in their adopting a harder stance toward Japan. In the U.S. as well, Japanese seem to have scant awareness of the reality that Americans of Chinese and Korean origin, both of which contributed to Mr. Obama's reelection in 2012, have gained more influence in political circles.  * Even if the Kono Statement is maintained, Japan-Korean relations will not recover  On March 25 in The Hague, Netherlands, a U.S.-sponsored summit between the leaders of the U.S., Japan and South Korea, held to discuss the ""threat from North Korea,"" proved an illustrative event. President Obama sat in the center of the table, flanked on each side by President Park and Prime Minister Abe, the faces of each showing cold, formal expressions. This impasse was due to the corner into which Mr. Abe has painted himself.  Since the forming of his new government Abe had avoided any mention of acknowledging the ""Kono Statement"" of 1993 that apologized for various transgressions against South Korea. Then on March 14, just 10 days before flying to The Hague, he only acceded to it under pressure, as South Korea had made it a condition for its attending the joint talks. Immediately afterwards, however, people close to the prime minister's office were making remarks to the effect that ""As investigations proceed, [the statement] might be revised.""  Despite the two having shaken hands, and Mr. Abe greeting Korea's president in her own language, the meeting so far has had no effect whatsoever in mending fences between Japan and South Korea. Whether or not Mr. Obama's planned visit to the two countries, to commence from April 24, will succeed in finding a way to break this impasse will proceed with the double irony that the situation was once again dependent on American intervention.  If Japan can achieve ""breakthrough diplomacy"" in its relations with the United States, such as by a visit to Hiroshima by President Obama -- without necessarily depending on it being a ""state visit"" with a tight itinerary -- I suppose it's possible this will be supported by calls to Mr. Obama for such a visit from the U.S. side as well.  Next year will mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the war. Thanks to the measured success of Abenomics, the Abe administration is beginning to exhibit the potential to stay in power for an extended period. I think what should now be sought is broadminded diplomacy that will conclusively bring about reconciliation, with ceremonies involving offering of floral tributes at the USS Arizona Memorial and in Hiroshima. Before long those repercussions would also spread to Beijing, Nanjing, Seoul and finally all the way to Pyongyang. For Abe diplomacy, I believe it would also lead to an opportunity to break out from constantly being on the defensive and set the stage for a situation in which ""slow and steady wins the race.""  In 2009, I published a book by Shogakkan 101 Shinsho titled ""The day President Obama offers flowers at Hiroshima -- the opening up the way to historical reconciliation via the diplomacy of mutual floral offerings."" Based on my travels to Dresden, Coventry, Cologne, Guernica, Auschwitz and other places, that book closely examines the differences between how Germany achieved reconciliation with European countries and the differences between that country's approach and Japan's. I would be honored if you'd read it."

There's no doubt that we ejected the Communists from power thanks to the fact that he mobilised us,"" said Leokadia Tylek, visiting the late pope's home town of Wadowice.That role has become relevant again for many Poles since Russia's military intervention in neighbouring Ukraine. An opinion poll this month showed Poles more worried about their national independence than at any time since the Cold War.""Now may he protect us from the misfortune looming from the east,"" Tylek said in Wadowice, about 50 km southwest of Krakow. PILGRIMS' PROGRESSMany Poles go further and say the pontiff will become their nation's new patron saint. ""Pope John Paul II will be the patron saint of human rights, and of the family,"" Krakow Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, the pope's private secretary, told reporters.The home in Wadowice where the future pope grew up is now a museum visited by thousands of pilgrims. Refurbished in time for the canonisation, its re-opening earlier this month was attended by dignitaries including Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.""This museum is a magnet for tourists and I hope very much that the town will benefit from the increased interest in the Polish Holy Father,"" Wadowice Mayor Ewa Filipiak told Reuters. ""Tourism could generate big revenues for the town budget.""Paying tribute to the memory of Pope John Paul II is now a multi-million-euro business.Surveys by the regional tourist board show about 15 percent of the nearly 10 million visitors to Krakow each year come for religious purposes, mostly associated with the late pope.Trefl, the company that makes the pope-themed jigsaw puzzles, said it had delivered about 20,000 puzzles to stores, and that the canonisation was driving up demand.""This is an unique collection,"" said Aleksandra Krzyminska, public relations manager for the firm.Artist Czeslaw Dzwigaj satisfies the more discerning end of the memorabilia market. He has been producing statues of the pope in his studio in Rzaska, near Krakow since 1987. At the turn of the century, he had five or six commissions a year.Demand has since slowed, probably because the market was saturated with John Paul II statues. ""But I have orders for busts and memorial plaques,"" Dzwigaj told Reuters.WINTER IN THE CHURCHThe Polish parliament on Thursday adopted a resolution expressing its gratitude and esteem for the late pope, though some legislators tried to block it, arguing that religion and the state should be kept separate.Others among Poland's 38 million population openly challenge the former pontiff's legacy.Tadeusz Bartos, a philosophy professor at the Academy of Humanities in Pultusk, near Warsaw, says most Poles are so keen to embrace him as a national hero that they see any criticism as ""equal to tarnishing sanctity, spitting on the altar"".He noted the pope's rigid opposition to condom use at a time when AIDS was rampant, allegations he did not do enough to tackle child sex abuse involving priests, and he accused him of gagging free debate within the faith.""John Paul II brought winter to the Church,"" said Bartos.Some, meanwhile, are simply indifferent. As Poles grow wealthier and more of them embrace western European values and aspirations, the numbers going to church are shrinking.""If someone wants to give a new status to a deceased person, then I'm cool with it,"" said Agnieszka Hejne, 20, a student in the Polish capital, Warsaw.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae9ab42200003501daffd3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For months articles have cited statistics that President Obama is on track to deport 2 million individuals -- the same amount of people as deported in the more than 100 years between 1892 and 1997. However, a recent article in The New York Times reported that ""court deportations drop[ped] 43 percent in past five years."" These contradicting statistics create opposing images of the Obama administration's immigration policies: either President Obama is rightly being called ""deporter in chief"" or he is effectively practicing the prosecutorial discretion he promised.As law professor Anna O. Law explains, these confusing statistics are the result of the broad use of the term ""deportation,"" which conflates ""removals"" (individuals who undergo legal proceedings to remove them from the U.S.) and ""returns"" (individuals who are caught entering into the U.S. and returned without official legal proceedings). In fact, the Obama administration has ""deported"" close to 2 million individuals if you count both removals and returns. However, the 43-percent drop in removals means that many of these 2 million people are being returned while crossing the border, rather than while going about their lives in the U.S.In part, this shift is laudable, as this 43-percent drop in removals means that fewer undocumented individuals who have spent years living in the U.S. are being torn away from the lives they have built in the U.S. Despite this decrease in removals, a large number of individuals are still being removed through programs like Secure Communities, a cooperative program between immigration officials and local police. Under Secure Communities any interaction with police brings the potential risk of deportation. While the program is intended to target criminals, the majority of individuals are still deported for minor crimes like traffic violations. In other words, undocumented immigrants living in (not entering) the U.S. are less likely to be ""deported"" than in previous administrations; however, those who are ""deported"" are more likely to be non-criminals than criminals.Despite these new statistics, it is important to keep in mind that the social costs of deportation are not decreasing. While deportation is a severe consequence for being an undocumented immigrant, the threat and fear of deportation dramatically shapes the lives of undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants know family, friends, and community members who have been deported, and they hear about deportation raids and statistics on the news. This creates a sense of fear within the undocumented community, which essentially broadens the impact of deportation beyond those who are actually deported. Thus, the increased discussion of deportation in the news has likely increased the fear of deportation, no matter what the statistics say.This fear of deportation impacts not only undocumented immigrants but the undocumented and citizen individuals in their social network who fear being separated from their loved ones. These social ties exponentially increase the negative impact that removals have on U.S. communities. Particularly at risk are the 4.5 million U.S. citizen children of undocumented immigrants who do not understand the particularities of statistics but do know what deportation would mean for their families: separation, pain, and suffering.As debates about immigration statistics are bound to continue, we need to keep in mind that these statistics are people. Although clear and correct statistics are no doubt useful in painting a picture, we must ask how much they matter. What is clear from these statistics is that people are being deported, and families and communities are suffering. With that in mind, isn't any number too high?"

It was announced on Monday that the State Grand Jury would look into ethics complaints against the speaker. (AP Photo/Rainier Ehrhardt)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c5cb220000bb01dd7707.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- South Carolina's Republican state House speaker, who is facing a grand jury investigation on corruption allegations, wants a state court to end the probe and allow his colleagues to decide first if he has done anything wrong.In February 2013, a watchdog group filed a complaint with the state attorney general alleging that Speaker Bobby Harrell (R) had improperly paid himself $325,000 in campaign funds for flights he piloted. The group also accused him of pressuring regulators on behalf of his business. Attorney General Alan Wilson (R) convened a grand jury to look into the complaint in January, after a 10-month investigation by the State Law Enforcement Division. Lawyers for Harrell will argue in a hearing next week before the court that oversees the grand jury that the attorney general lacks jurisdiction and that the case should be moved to the House Ethics Committee, the Charleston Post and Courier reported Tuesday. Harrell's lawyer, Gedney Howe, told the paper, ""The ethics committee has the exclusive jurisdiction. That's the only entity with jurisdiction.""Ethics advocates argue that shifting the case to the House panel would essentially kill the investigation. ""The House Ethics Committee is nothing but a fraud,"" said John Crangle, who leads Common Cause South Carolina, in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""It's never done anything. To send it to the House Ethics Committee is basically to deep-six it, which is exactly what Harrell would like to do.""A spokesman for Harrell did not return a request for comment.A pair of bipartisan House bills were introduced this month that would allow Harrell and the state Senate leader to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue ethics accusations against legislators, rather than leaving such matters to the attorney general. But lawmakers quickly deserted the bills, and they appear unlikely to get a vote in the Senate, according to The State newspaper in Columbia, S.C. An editorial in the paper last week counted the effort as Harrell's fifth attempt to stop the investigation.The latest argument -- that the grand jury lacks jurisdiction -- is unusual, Crangle said. The lawyer told the Post and Courier on Tuesday, ""I've never heard of anybody trying to stop a state grand jury probe -- that's basically what they're trying to do."" He told HuffPost that the state constitution gives the attorney general ""plain authority to prosecute all criminal matters.""The South Carolina Policy Council, which brought the complaint against Harrell, argued in its February 2013 letter to the attorney general that the matter poses a conflict of interest for the House panel. As speaker, Harrell hires the House Ethics Committee's staff, would be responsible for authorizing an independent investigator and can call a House session to appeal the committee's conclusions, the conservative group said. Further, the group believes that the attorney general should have jurisdiction because the accusations rise to a criminal level. ""What we alleged was public corruption, which is a felony,"" said Ashley Landess, the South Carolina Policy Council's president, in a briefing with reporters Wednesday. Landess said she decided to bring the complaint last year to the attorney general instead of to the House Ethics Committee after an informal meeting with its chairman, Rep. Kenny Bingham (R). Landess said that Bingham ""expressed concern that the ethics committee would have some problems taking this."" Landess said her impression was that Bingham felt his committee was not qualified to investigate the case. Bingham told the Post and Courier on Wednesday that the attorney general is better suited to look into the complaint, though his committee could employ outside counsel. ""We're a civil body. What she was alleging is elements of public corruption and criminal behavior. We're not a police department,"" he told the paper.Crangle said he fears that Circuit Court Judge L. Casey Manning will refer the Harrell case to the House committee, citing his earlier decision in 2012 to move an ethics complaint filed against now-Gov. Nikki Haley (R) back to the House. Haley, then a state representative, was accused of lobbying illegally. The House committee dismissed the allegations against her three months later. ""I don't see how in the world Judge Manning could remand this matter to the House Ethics Committee, on the law and the facts,"" Crangle told HuffPost. ""But, because South Carolina is extremely political -- I believe that we really don't have the rule of law in South Carolina, we have politics instead -- anything is possible."""

Today the songbird is finding an emotional equilibrium by limiting her wine consumption.

KeKe Wyatt/Credit: Alex Martinez  Since Wyatt's lifestyle change is fairly recent viewers will still get plenty of drama from her as she balances her professional life (working on an EP titled Keke) with her demanding roles as mom, wife and daughter. On the new season, Wyatt's mother appears on the show and it has her worried about the harsh public criticism that may follow.  ""That's a part of my life I didn't want everybody to see because people can be judgmental and that's my mama.

Syleena Johnson/Credit: Alex Martinez""My husband and I are in couples therapy which you will see on season three. All of the songs and content are based on what's going on in a relationship that would call for couples therapy. There was lack of communication--being busy and having kids--and it caused us to really disconnect,"" she shared.  Johnson's relationship with fellow original cast members, Nicci Gilbert and Faith Evans (the latter two are still credited as executive producers on the show) is also complicated. Even with Evans off-screen she is at the center of on-screen issues dealing with the fallout from an apparent Grammy snub over the cast album, ""R&B Divas."" Earlier this year, Evans was the only cast member nominated for Best R&B Album at the Grammys, despite it being a compilation including the show's original stars (Wyatt, Johnson, Gilbert, Monifah) and others.  ""It was presented to us a as a compilation CD but not entered into the Grammy Awards as a compilation CD. It was entered as a Faith Evans album,"" revealed Johnson. ""Faith sits on the Grammy board and she is literate with the rules. It appears to be--I can't say malicious. It's possible it went over her head, I doubt it, but I don't know. It looks selfish and like we were shafted.""  Johnson is pleased with the addition of the show's two new cast members, Meelah Williams (former 702 lead singer) and LaTavia Roberson (former member of Destiny's Child).

(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb45a2f3c000066000c95af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In ""Life Partners,"" Gillian Jacobs plays the balanced and sensible Paige opposite Leighton Meester's free-spirited Sasha. The film is the latest in an onslaught of gal pal-centered stories to hit the big and small screens. In the vein of ""Broad City"" and ""Frances Ha,"" ""Life Partners"" takes a modern look at female friendship, but with one twist: Jacobs' character is straight, while Meester's is gay. The plot borrows from the lives of director Susanna Fogel and her longtime writing partner, Joni Lefkowitz, both making their feature-film debut.Jacobs, best known for her role on ""Community,"" is joined by Adam Brody in the role of her new boyfriend who interferes with Paige and Sasha's friendship. Abby Elliott, Gabourey Sidibe and Kate McKinnon also pop up in memorable supporting roles, making ""Life Partners"" an ensemble piece about the changing tides of friendship throughout one's 20s. The movie had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 18. HuffPost Entertainment chatted with Jacobs the following day, when she explained why tales of female friendship are all the rage. There have been so many gal-pal stories over the past few years. Well, think about how many movies are about male friendship.So this is the response to ""The Hangover""? Yeah, I mean, it’s really exciting. Joni and Susanna have been writing partners for years. Obviously there are some autobiographical elements to this, and so it’s really exciting to see women putting their own stories up on screen. It’s a really funny, specific, relatable story about friendship that certainly resonated with me. But I think women and men will enjoy the film. Have you watched ""Broad City""? I haven’t seen the whole season, but I really loved it. There was that one joke when her roommate throws away the Bed, Bath and Beyond coupons, and he’s like, “They were expired.” And she’s like, “They don’t expire!” That’s the same fight I’ve had with roommates and boyfriends because I hoard Bed, Bath and Beyond coupons. It doesn’t matter what it says on there -- they will take it. And so I have totally had that fight before, and it was one of those perfect moments where you’re like, “Yes!” And I turned to the person I was watching it with and I was like, “See! I told you!”Do you have a similar rapport with a friend as you do with Leighton in this movie? My best friend is a 50-year-old man, so we have a very close friendship, but it is not a peer-to-peer female friendship. I’ve been lucky to have a lot of really close female friends, but I think especially the movie touches on hitting a transitional phase of your life and how that affects your friendships. I definitely felt that at various times in my life, where either somebody gets in a serious relationship for the first time or you get a job and your career takes off, and it can put a strain on your friendships. It all works out in the end, but it’s never quite the same as it was when the two of you just had each other. So where will these characters be in 10 years if there’s a sequel?  Maybe one of them has kids and the other is slightly annoyed by the fact that they have to do kid-related things.You would have kids, I assume? You don’t know!Unless the tables have turned. Yeah, you don’t know. Sands of time. Things could shift. But there would be conflict about having to do solely kid-related activities. It would probably be a Nicole Holofcener move in 10 years. It would be the baby version of “Enough Said.” Did you see that movie?Yes, what a great movie. Isn’t it so good?I love everything Nicole Holofcener touches. I know, it was so good. Maybe it’ll be the junior version of “Enough Said.”Was it icky at all ... [Laughs] I know where you’re going.... to stage a romance onscreen with your co-star’s then boyfriend, now husband?  I wouldn’t say icky because that would imply it’s gross to kiss Adam Brody, which it’s not. But I’m way more awkward than Leighton and Adam are. They’re way more chill, cool, laid-back people who don’t really get ruffled by things. I’m much more neurotic, so I would get very awkward and blush. I don’t think I really had to kiss him in front of her. But they were far more chill about it. I’m like, “Ooooooh!” So it was a non-issue that I probably worked up in my head. Did improv change any of the scenes? Leighton and I would just end up touching each other all the time and end up humping each other, and they were like, “That’s confusing! That’s not the story. You’re not gay, too, so stop humping Leighton.” But we just had a very tactile friendship onscreen, and I think you can see that. I’m just happy because we look at ease around each other, and in truth we’d met only maybe three times before we started shooting the movie. So I consider that an achievement for us. In the scene where I’m saying I hate that he wears message t-shirts, Beth Dover’s wearing one that says “Bitchin.’” And I improved saying, “Well, at least that’s a positive message.” By my count, you have seven movies coming out in 2014. Was 2013 an absurdly busy year? Yeah, last year I did five movies and a web series and 13 episodes of TV. That was a lot. How do you pencil it all in? On “Community,” since we’ve only done 13 episodes for the last two seasons, we basically work from August to December. Then I have December to August off to do other things, so I’m trying to pace myself a little more this year. As you can tell by my IMDB page, I like to work. But I didn’t take a vacation or a break last year. I only traveled for work and didn’t really do anything for fun, so I felt like this year I should maybe take some more time off. Which of those movies are you most excited about? What I think is a really special movie is “Black and White” with Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer, which Mike Binder directed. I got to see a screening of it, and I think Kevin and Octavia and Anthony Mackie and Bill Burr all give such beautiful performances in that movie. The little girl who plays Kevin Costner’s granddaughter is amazing, Gillian, and I think that movie turned out so well and I can’t wait for people to see it because it’s the most vulnerable and moving Kevin Costner performance I’m seen in a long time.You’ve been a guest chef on “The Chew” ... Oh, I wouldn’t say chef. Food mangler maybe. ... and a guest judge on “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” What is the reality show you’re most ill-suited to appear on? Did you see me on “The Chew”? I was terrible. Shouldn’t that be part of their schtick? Let’s just get people who have no cooking sensibilities? I was really bad. I’m a terrible cook. But anything sports related I would be terrible at. If I had to do anything physical, like I would love to, but I’d be really bad at a “Billy on the Street” obstacle course. Did you see the one that [Joel McHale] just did? About the Mo'Lympics?I haven’t, but he’s had some great stuff this season. Do you love the show? I love the show. I think I would be game for “Billy on the Street” because I would be so excited because I’m such a fan, but maybe I couldn’t keep up with him running. But let’s throw down the gauntlet. Let’s see how I do on “Billy on the Street.” We’ll put that out in the universe. Will you run around asking if people would have sex with you for $1? Tell Olivia Wilde she’s pretty? Would you have sex with Paul Rudd? Any of those. So good. What did he have Rashida Jones do, guess if people are Jewish or not? I love that show so much. I would shovel dirt for Billy. Well, with that offer ... Right? Because you always need dirt-shoveling on a TV show. In New York City, especially.  Find the dirt first, then shovel it. How about a big-budget “Hunger Games”-type project? Ya know, sure, yes, why not? I’m a trained actress. I can do anything. That’s what they tell you in drama school. Yeah, that would be fun. I think Elizabeth Banks is great in “The Hunger Games.” What the fuck? Sure. I could run and shoot an arrow. To close, I'm going to give you a superlative and two of your co-stars. You tell me which one you'd select. First, who'd you rather as your boss: Steve Carell or Joel McHale? Oh god, Steve Carell. Joel McHale is a terrible person. Your way-too-young stepmom: Cameron Diaz or Elizabeth Banks? Oh, that’s a tough one. They’re both so awesome. Maybe Cameron Diaz because she doesn’t have children in real life, so she would extra spoil me. Elizabeth has real kids, so she would have more rules. She’d have more structure; Cameron would probably let me eat as much candy as I want to.Who would you go to for advice: Adam Scott or Adam Brody? Adam Scott because he’s got kids, he’s been married for longer and for no other good reason than that. He could give me child-rearing tips. [Adam Brody] doesn’t have any kids yet. Who you'd most trust with a secret: Yvette Nicole Brown or Jim Rash? Oooooh! You know what, I trust both of those people. Guess I’ll have to go with Yvette, but you know what, that was a tough choice you picked. Those are two really trustworthy people. Well done. This interview has been edited and condensed."

(AP Photo/Courtesy Sundance Selects, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5f9991f00002501249430.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Samantha Ladwig  Originally posted on Literally, DarlingThis past year/year and half, directors like Abdellatif Kechiche (Blue is the Warmest Color), and Lars Von Trier (Nymphomaniac) have been major contributing factors in changing sex in movies. Both independent films have gained significant amounts of praise and publicity. The narrative drives the inclusion of sex within their movies, which is uncommon compared to movies that incorporate sex for no relative thematic purpose (300, Star Trek: Into Darkness, any teenage Not Another Teen Movie sort of movie, Cabin Fever, Cabin in the Woods [although I absolute love that movie] and the list goes on). The shift from sex and sexuality represented in these movies in comparison to past years (besides narrative purpose, which is a huge one) is that sex is now becoming a part of character development. Rather than paying attention to the fact that two people are going at each other in the movie, you're actually focused on how this adds to the emotion, how it will progress the story, narrative, plot, and other creative aspects of film. This change in sexuality begs the question of why directors are retracting from traditional Hollywood, glorified representations of sex and sexuality? And will this shift become the new norm within sexually driven movies?Before we dive in, I want to say that this is not an article about women's bodies represented in films. Nor is it an article about how we need to normalize what women look like during sex in films (i.e. body types, positions, sounds, all things that have been influenced by pornography and male dominated society). Many women, and some men, are already pushing to redefine these norms. This is an article about sex between women and men, women and women, and there are indeed recent movies out there about men and men (Weekend directed by Andrew Haigh). This is an article about sex at its rawest moment, without Hollywood glamour, portrayed as something beautiful and as something that effects who we are.Blue is the Warmest Color, rated NC-17, is simply about a girl finding herself as she is introduced to love. The sex within this movie is indeed, totally and completely, raw. The first time I saw it, I was absolutely shocked. The moment the two women finally get together is seven minutes long, and sound only comes through in their breathing and moans. However, I wasn't shocked because I felt like I was watching porn. It was because it was so realistic that I felt I was intruding. The uncomfortable-ness felt during these scenes was not a negative in the slightest. Their intimate moments were a vital part to the story. The relationship of the two main characters is very much defined on their passion for one another. And it's also their sexual drive that pulls them apart. The difference between this couple and other romantic movies is that we are watching their relationship both progress and decline; the way they express their desire in the beginning and then at the end. We are watching the progression of a very realistic, twenty-something relationship. We as viewers are able to detect where they are emotionally by the intimacy they portray for one another. The difference between sex here and sex seen in other movies is that we can relate. Hopefully this realism can positively influence our expectations when we're experiencing these vulnerable moments. (Side note, I am aware that there has been controversy between the actors and director, but I chose not to dive into that and to simply stick to the narrative and thematic aspects.)The sex utilized in Nymphomaniac is in no way glamorous, glorified, or desirable. The movie centers on the life of a female nymphomaniac as she tells her story to a virgin man that equates her sex-capades to biblical references, fishhooks, and paintings. Lars Von Trier uses sex in his movie because the movie is about sex and it would be difficult to tell the story of a nymphomaniac without including her sexual history. But what sets this apart from a romanticized, glamorous, unattainable Hollywood production is that sex is not a positive. When we see her venture from one man to the next, we're not paying attention to either of their genitals, we're paying attention to her narration, emotional setting, and how she is progressing as a character. Indeed the woman is naked 90 percent of the time, but it is never erotic, nor spruced up with dim lighting and sensual music. For example, when Joe is finally able to be with Shia Labouf's character, we are anticipating her realization that love exists and is a vital part to sexual experiences. Although we are in fact watching two people have vaginal sex, it is completely overshadowed by our connection to Joe's emotional reaction towards finally being with someone she believes she feels for. But after treating all of her sexual encounters as disposable entities in her attaining an orgasm, she understands that she no longer is able to feel anything for anyone. And that moment takes away from the shock value that sex scenes potentially hold within film. The sex drives the narrative, it actually holds a purpose. It's a story about a woman who refuses to call herself a sex addict because the word nymphomaniac holds much more power and she enjoys being empowered through controlling her sexual experiences. It makes the viewer question our use of the word c*nt, as well as whore. Because c*nt involves the entire female genitalia, unlike vagina that only speaks to specific parts. And whore because despite her amount of sexual partners, that is never a word that a viewer would choose to define her. Essentially, this movie would not exist if it didn't include sex, and it wouldn't have such a high recommendation if her experiences were overshadowed by Hollywood standards.Of course there are other movies out that involve realistic sexual encounters (such as Steve McQueen's Shame), but few drive the narrative and add to character development. Like the slow shift of the female body in media, I hope to see more realistic sex when it is necessary and holds significance to the film. Too many movies incorporate sex and women's bodies without explaining the purpose of it. If these two movies can teach us anything, it is that both female and male anatomy can be used without shocking audiences and actually have the ability to push the film narrative further. Literally, Darling, is an online magazine by and for twenty-something women, which features the personal, provocative, awkward, pop-filled and pressing issues of our gender and generation. This is an exact representation of our exaggerated selves."
