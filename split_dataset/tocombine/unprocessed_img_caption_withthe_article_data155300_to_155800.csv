It hasn’t been uncomfortable at any moment. We’re just regular people just having a relationship.”Though the couple has been under the microscope as a pair, there's no doubt that Patrick is the more high-profile of the two -- something that Stenhouse says he has no problem with. “People notice her,” he said with a laugh. “It’s still funny, people are telling her, ‘Hey, good luck this weekend.’ And I’m thinking, ‘Thanks. You’re not going to tell me good luck?’ … All in all, it’s been really fun.”Patrick and Stenhouse confirmed rumors of their romance to the Associated Press back in February -- less than a month after she officially filed for divorce from husband of seven years, Paul Hospenthal. She first announced her plans to divorce Hospenthal -- who is 17 years her senior -- in November 2012 on her Facebook page. They finalized their split in April 2013.

France's health ministry reported the country's first case of a SARS-like virus that has so far killed 18 people, mostly in Saudi Arabia. The virus, known as nCoV-EMC, is a cousin of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which triggered a scare 10 years ago when it erupted in east Asia, leaping to humans from animal hosts and killing some 800 people.

""The results of the tests carried out on these two people will be known soon and will be made public.""As France reported the 65-year-old as its first case of the coronoavirus on Wednesday, the World Health Organisation said it would send experts to visit a Saudi hospital from which the virus has spread, killing seven people so far.The French case brought the total number of known infections worldwide to 31, of which 18 resulted in death.Coronavirus is from the same viral family that triggered the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that swept the world from Asia in late 2003, killing 775 people.Despite there being no evidence so far of sustained human-to-human transmission, health experts' concerns are growing over clusters of new cases.

2,FOOD & DRINK,Vegan Dinner Party Recipes: Cooking An Animal-Free Meal That Everyone Will Like (PHOTOS),Rebecca Orchant,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vegan-dinner-party-recipes_us_5b9d2435e4b03a1dcc84d50e,Cooking a whole meal without animal products can sometimes strike fear in our hearts.,2013-05-09,Creamy Parsnip And Sunchoke Soup With Crispy Mushrooms,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d24332100003300c56603.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"At this point in our lives, we're pretty sure we all have at least one vegan. Maybe a best friend. Maybe an in-law. We love these people, we know they are just like us, but -- and we're being brutally honest here -- thinking about cooking a whole meal for them can strike fear in the hearts of us cheese/butter/bacon eaters. It's okay. They know. But at some point, you're going to have to cook them a meal, so it might as well be delicious for everyone.One of our favorite vegans, personal chef Emma Gonzalez, sat down with us to talk vegan food, and what to worry/not worry about when you cook vegan food. As an added bonus, she also fed us. I was first introduced to Emma's cooking when she started doing a weekly vegan bar food pop-up in my neighborhood. Vegan bar food? The thought intrigued me. Week after week, Emma proved to a confirmed old cheese proselytizer like me that vegan food can not only be satisfying and delicious, but also totally decadent. Although Emma's pop-ups are no longer happening, she's begun to concentrate more fully on her at-home personal chef business. Yes, that means she will come to your house and cook you delicious things.The vegan dinner party menu that Emma put together for us covers all your bases. It tastes great, looks beautiful, fills you up and even includes some indulgences like fried food and dessert. Check out Emma's tips, tricks and recipes below, and know in your heart that you know what to eat when a vegan comes over.HP: What do you wish people who invited you over to dinner knew? EG: Food is such a personal thing; don't assume that because I'm vegan, I'm judging you! I eat more than salad. Also, a lot of the things you eat as a non-vegan, are actually vegan! Making plant-based food doesn't have to be complicated or flavorless. Also, if you've made an effort to cook animal-free food, I'll be so delighted, I'll love whatever it is (as long as it's not naked lettuce and three cherry tomatoes. Nobody likes that.)HP: What's the one ingredient you can't live without? EG: Equipment-wise, a food processor is my magical key to deliciousness. You can completely transform ingredients by pureeing them. Also, check out nutritional yeast. In addition to providing B vitamins, it lends a savory richness. Thicken sauces, sprinkle on popcorn, or mix it with ground walnuts, salt, and onion powder for an AWESOME topping to use like parmesan.HP: When you build a vegan menu, what are some things you take into consideration? EG: Balance is the goal. So, a mix of textures, flavors, temperatures and nutrients is important. A sprinkle of nuts or fresh herbs can turn a good dish into a great one. If something is too spicy, temper it with a little sweetness. Not that every meal needs to be super-healthy, but I do try to keep health in mind. Will people feel good when they've left the table? Will they have eaten protein, iron, vitamin C, etc.? Will they feel heavy and lethargic, or satiated and energetic? Maybe that sounds annoying, but I want guests to be up to a game of charades after dinner, so I need them in top form. [*Ed Note: Emma is definitely really great at charades, she means this.]HP: What's the worst vegan option you've ever been served? EG: Once, I tried to eat at Cracker Barrel on a road trip (It was the South. I love gift shops). After I explained my dietary situation, the very frustrated server told me that they had brown rice, but when he brought it to the table, it was actually white rice, cooked in beef broth. I should have brought trail mix with me on that trip. I felt like a weenie. HP: What do you think surprises people most about your food? EG: I don't use mock-meats, which some think of as necessary to meat-free cooking. I think people are often surprised that my food is hearty and satisfying. They forget it's vegan! Also, preparing vegan meals doesn't have to be totally restrictive. Instead of dwelling on what not to eat, celebrate all the wonderful, colorful, healthy things you have to work with!We can't make perfect choices all the time, but everyone has an issue that they stand up for -- a choice they make, to feel like less of a jerk about being alive. I choose not to support the inhumane and environmentally destructive practices of factory farms (which, to be fair, you can totally do while still eating the right animal products). I'm vegan, and it makes me happy. While I don't believe that everyone needs to eliminate animal products altogether, I do think we can all stand to eat more vegetables! What to eat is a big, ever-changing topic. Open the discussion with a plate of something delicious!We couldn't agree more.

5,WELLNESS,"McDonald's And Subway Nutrition Can Be Equally Bad For Teens, Study Finds",Rachel Tepper,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcdonalds-subway-nutrition-teens_us_5b9d2550e4b03a1dcc84e12c,"Subway may seem like a healthier fast food option than McDonald's, but a recent study suggests that teenagers often consume",2013-05-09,GERMANY - JULY 12: Employee of the US American sandwich fast-food chain Subway with a sandwich. (Photo by Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d255026000035007fc008.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Subway may seem like a healthier fast food option than McDonald's, but a recent study suggests that teenagers often consume roughly the same number of calories at both chains.The study was conducted by experts from a host of lauded research institutions, including UCLA. It draws its conclusions from the habits of 97 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 21 who purchased meals with their own money at McDonald's and Subway restaurants in a shopping mall in Carson, Calif. Total calorie counts were estimated based on the nutritional information available on the chains' websites. The results were published on May 6 in the Journal of Adolescent Health.On average, the participants consumed 1,038 calories at McDonald's and 955 calories at Subway. In a UCLA press release, the study's lead researcher, Dr. Lenard Lesser, said that ""there was no statistically significant difference between the two restaurants, and that participants ate too many calories at both."" Lesser also said that the nutrient profile at Subway was slightly better than at McDonald's, but its food still contained ""three times the amount of salt that the Institute of Medicine recommends.""The study also found that although McDonald's sandwiches tended to be less caloric on average than Subway's (572 vs. 784 calories), McDonald's fries packed a much heavier punch than Subway's potato chips (201 vs. 61 calories). Sugary drinks, too, added more calories on average at McDonald's than Subway (151 vs. 61 calories). If some of those numbers seem low (61 calories for potato chips?), remember that it's an average -- some people may have eaten a whole bag and others no chips at all.The news may come as a shock to some consumers who believe that Subway is a healthy option. But, as the study notes in its conclusion, ""[t]he true measure of a healthy restaurant ... is whether people actually consume a healthy meal there. If the healthy options do not look attractive, are not displayed prominently, are priced higher, or are offered with high-calorie side dishes, consumers may be less likely to choose those foods.""Speaking to the LA Times, Lesser said that the message of the study is often overshadowed by powerful marketing that is ""a lot more powerful than what one physician says in the newspaper."" He cited a high profile Subway advertisement for its meatball sub and a McDonald's promotion for pink lemonade, for which the store was covered in pink promotional materials. ""We don’t often see those things for the healthier items,” he said."
