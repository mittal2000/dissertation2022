0,FOOD & DRINK,Minton's and The Cecil Bring Jazz and Spice to Harlem,"John Mariani, Contributor

(photo by Evan Sung) Founded in 1938 by saxophonist Henry Minton, Minton's Playhouse was the crucible for jazz that came to be called bee-bop, whose innovators included giants like Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Charlie Christian. Minton's was going strong until 1974 when a fire razed the hotel in which it was located, and, through those dark days of Harlem's history, Minton's stayed dark. Happily for everyone, Minton's (212-243-2222) has new owners who have brought back the look of the modest-sized room whose antecedent was listed on both the National and the New York State Register of Historic Places. Minton's is certainly one of the most handsome new  restaurants to open this year, right down to the white tablecloths and swank curtains. Huge photos of jazz stars bring back the memories, as does a house band of stellar musicians, and the respect paid by owner Richard Parcels and partner-chef Alexander Smalls to the traditions of Harlem cookery -- he calls it ""Southern Revival Cooking"" -- is evident on a menu that includes a lavish ""Low Country Experience"" of appetizers -- Beau Soleil oysters with Champagne mignonette and osietra caviar; deviled egg toast with smoked trout and pickled shallots; fried okra and country ham; blue crab fritter with sauce rouille; a lusty bacon pilau with smoked chipotle aïoli; and cremini mushrooms with creamed collard greens ($24). Other fine starters include as tangy sherried she-crab soup with crispy yams and skillet bread ($18) and a roasted parsnip and kabocha squash soup with benne seed crunch and brown butter crème fraîche ($14). Among the main courses, I recommend the smoked Berkshire pork chop with a yam hominy grit cake and winter greens ($39), which shows a refinement of country cooking for which chef de cuisine Banks White shows real talent. Plump quail is also smoked, served with a giblet cornbread cake and cranberry cardamon cake ($34). A generous casserole of lobster and shrimp comes with a rich Creole crawfish gravy and pimento cheese grits. And you will not easily forget the fabulous, if misshapen, flakey Southern biscuits at Minton's, which are a dazzling riff on culinary tradition as much as bee-bop was on New Orleans jazz. On the busy Saturday night I visited, some of the dishes were not up to others, and some came out tepid, not hot, perhaps owing to a menu unnecessarily large for this size restaurant. I trust the kitchen will get into the swing of things and coordinate all the cooking with more finesse.   For dessert the best is a pineapple upside down cake with corn cream and a blueberry compote.  Just a few yards away from Minton's is The Cecil; (212-866-1262), whose piped-in background music indicates that this is more of a restaurant than a jazz venue. Here, Smalls, with Chef de Cuisine Joseph ""JJ"" Johnson, are doing what they call the ""comfort food of the African Diaspora,"" so that you may roam from a delicious West African beef suya with rum-soaked apricot compote, grilled plantains and groundnuts to Gullah shrimp min-burgers with housemade kimchi and scallions.  I arrived at The Cecil with three very hungry guys, finding the bar up front bopping. A beautiful and wholly engaging Haitian-born manager named Paola Mathe brought us to our table and checked back all night. Our cocktails were impeccably rendered, and we began ordering from every section of a long menu. A white root vegetable soup was laced with red curry oil and chives ($9), and a black bottom bean cake came with a fruity-spicy papaya salsa and plantain chips ($11). ""Afro/Asian/American"" oxtail dumpling were spiked with a green apple curry sauce and crispy taro root ($14) for scooping up the sauce, and the spicy broiled prawns were gigantic indeed, with a yam flapjack and piri piri sauce ($15). There is a section called the ""rice & vegetable wok bar,"" from which you choose you preferred rice -- black, jasmine, sweet brown -- and top it with an array of options: we went with succulent country cut pork ribs ($24) and left not a morsel behind.  There was a slew of wonderful main courses, including a macaroni and cheese casserole ($16) with caramelized shallots and pepper ham, and feijoada, the beloved dish of Brazil bulked up with spicy black beans, oxtail, merguez lamb sausage ($27).   Long-braised lamb shank fell off the bone, accompanied by coconut grits, heirlooms carrots and purple sweet potato ($36), while duck fried noodles gained enormous flavor from a collard greens salsa verde, cashew broth and a poached egg on top ($32).  If, after having food this hearty, you have room for just one dessert, make it the pecan sticky buns with brown butter toffee and vanilla ice cream ($8)--and two forks. Then again, there's everything to love about the spiced Nyangbo crema sponge cake, chocolate croquante, and black cardamon ice cream ($8).  Perhaps what's most impressive about the menu here is that you won't find a single item on it served anywhere else in New York City. Every dish is very special, some unique, and a great deal of thought has gone into exotic seasonings here.   Indeed, if I may indulge a backhanded compliment to JJ Johnson, it's that, if you take food home -- and you will -- some dishes lose a great deal in taste and texture when consumed the next day, meaning that his cooking is not just fresh but depends on a very canny timing and devotion to each ingredient in a dish. Like pizza and French fries, they need to be consumed on the spot. The Cecil's roomy space, with a fine mural of an African-American woman, has tables made for piling on dishes, and the noise level is civilized. Bread baskets and bowls evoke those from home kitchens. Some of the well-meaning waitstaff need more education about the wine list, but overall I think it impossible that anyone going to The Cecil will be disappointed with the vibe and perhaps educated in the most savory way of the breadth and depth of The Cecil's style of cooking."
1,TRAVEL,Argentina Wine Country: Beyond Malbec! (PHOTOS),"Stefani Jackenthal, Contributor
Adventure Travel & Wine Journalist ~ Specialty: ""Detox to Retox""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/argentina-wine-country-be_us_5b9dbd64e4b03a1dcc8c49d6,"In the old cavernous wine cellar, we whet our appetites sampling wines from a handful of local producers, which we later sipped with a multi-course midday meal.",2014-01-02,2013-12-27-HumbertoCanaleDenarioMalbecwithPickingCoin.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-12-27-HumbertoCanaleDenarioMalbecwithPickingCoin-thumb.jpg,"When I told friends about my wine trip to Argentina, it was no surprise they assumed it would be all Malbec all the time. While Argentina is South America's largest wine producer and the world's largest producer of Malbec, its wine regions grow a wealth of varietals spanning from Torrontes to Riesling, Syrah to Bonarda, Cabernet Franc to Cabernet Sauvignon and the list goes on. Although, I was eager to sample Malbecs from Mendoza and Patagonia, my underlying mission was to explore the country's assortment of blends and single varietals beyond Malbec. Surprisingly, Malbec is not indigenous to Argentina. Rather, it's a French varietal that arrived in Mendoza with immigrants in the mid-1850s. To the delight of farmers and winemakers - and quaffers - the European vines took to Mendoza's loose sandy soil and desert climate. Today, over 70 percent of Argentina's wines come from Mendoza. Nestled on the east side of the Andes Mountains, Mendoza, dubbed a ""high desert oasis,"" gets less than 10 inches annual rainfall. So, vines rely on the Andes' ample snowmelt for pure water. Despite its considerable reputation, only 3 percent of Mendoza is developed. The rest is desert. Yet, grapes have unusually long ""hang-time"" and thrive under powerful high altitude sun -- vineyards are 2,000-7,000 feet -- that shines over 300 days annually. While cool, crisp nights allow grapes to rest and retain acids vital to dynamic wines. I was traveling with three fellow wine devotees and our first stop in Mendoza was at Fincas Don Martino, a welcoming, low-key winery with outstanding winemaking and fantastic fermentation tanks. Originally called Finca, ""La Violeta,"" when founded in 1926, the winery was taken over and re-launched in 2011. Following a swift tour of the modern winemaking facilities, at 10 a.m., we sat at a rectangular table, swirling, sniffing and sipping (and spitting) selections from their impressive portfolio. An admitted Cabernet Franc fan, I loved the Cabernet Franc Reserve, overflowing with spicy red plum, black cherry and touch of mint. A step up in maturity and structure, the Baldomir Gran Blend - 50 percent Malbec, 25 percent each Cabernet Franc and 25 percent Cabernet Sauvignon - had notes of raspberry, cassis and mocha. It would be great with roasted duck.Next, we visited Club Tapiz, an eco-friendly winery, restaurant and boutique inn, built in the 1890s, on the outskirts of Mendoza. Once owned by the Kendall Jackson Family (think California wine), it was bought a decade ago, by a lawyer and doctor, husband and wife team.In the old cavernous wine cellar, we whet our appetites sampling wines from a handful of local producers, which we later sipped with a multi-course midday meal. It was after one O'clock when we sat for lunch in the cozy, rustic upstairs dining room with floor to ceiling windows, overlooking some of the 24 acres of vineyards. My grilled shrimp was delicious with the crisp, minerally Tapiz Alta Chardonnay and would have been terrific with Amalaya's Vino Blanco, Torrentes-Riesling blend, I tasted earlier in the trip. While, Don Cristobal's stone fruit driven Verdejo was great with my trout entrée. Upon moving into red world, I enjoyed the Caligiore Malbec Reserva, a dynamic organic sipper packed with ripe black cherry and black plum. While Finca Las Moras Mora Negra, 70 percent Malbec and 30 percent Bonarda, 18 months in French oak, tickled my tastebuds with rustic spicy red fruit, chewy tannins. Another standout lunch in Mendoza was at Bodega Melipal, which offers tours and tastings. It's a gorgeous family-run winery with Malbec vines dating back to 1923. One of the most interesting twists on Malbec I discovered was Vicentin's Blanco de Malbec (White Malbec). Its pale pink body packed restrained watermelon, strawberry and lingering menthol on the finish. It was wacky, but delicious.While, Mendel Vineyards' Malbecs were amongst the most refined. From grapes grown on 80-year old vines, they had enticing toffee and holiday spice aromas with rich roasty blueberry and violet flavors.I also adored the area's Petit Verdot, especially from Finca Decero Winery. It pleased with herbal aromas, velvety wild dark berry and a generous finish. But I was most intrigued by the Bonarda grape, introduced to Argentina by Italian immigrants during the influx of European immigrants in the mid-1900s. Mairena Winery, produces a Bonarda aged in steel and another in oaked. Both packed terrific violet and ripe, dusty fruit, but the subtleness in texture and notable vanilla on the oak version were fun comparisons. While at dinner with folks from Bodegas Nieto Senetiner, a sprawling winery, founded 1888 by a group of Italian immigrants, and acquired by the Nieto Senetiner family in 1969, our hosts opened special bottles of 2000 Bonarda and 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon. The 14-year old Bonarda had elegant metal labels and retained deep, fresh fruit with underlying leather and spice. It was lip-smacking evidence that Mendoza's wine can age.A few days later at Bodegas Humberto Canale, in Rio Negro, Patagonia, we met winemaker Horacio Bibiloni, who made the fantastic Nieto's Senetir 2000 Bonarda -- before he started at Humberto Canale. Humberto Canale Winery, established in 1909, has retained its Wild West aura with vintage trucks carting wood barrels, horse-hitched wagons (sans horse) and gorgeous, regal handmade wood wine barrels peppering the vast barrel room. I had my first Asado here (sort of). I don't eat meat. So, while my pals pigged out on pig and miscellaneous mammal grilled over hot coals paired with Gran Reserva Malbec and Denario Reserve Malbec, I nibbled crunchy spinach empanadas and ""Asado"" grilled veggies, with Old Vine Riesling and Old Vine Pinot Noir. The racy Riesling, made from grapes grown on vines planted in 1937, was bright, ripe and rich laced with petrol and white peach. While, the Pinot Noir was equally excellent with toasty cherry Coke flavors splashed with spice and clove. Other Pinot Noirs that topped my list were Huarpe Winery in Mendoza and Familia Schroeder, a pioneer in the Neuquén Province that makes 100 percent Pinot Noir and an unusual Pinot Noir-Malbec blend, described as ""fruit salad that makes sense."" In summer, the fledging Neuquén Province in Patagonia gets 45 minutes more sunlight than Mendoza. Consequently, with dry weather and frequent southwest winds, grape quality is high, but yields of the small, thick-skinned berries are in low, limiting quantity. Since the region is at the same latitude as Marlborough, New Zealand, it makes sense that Pinot Noir does well here.When Schroeder winery was being built, dinosaur bones and eggs were uncovered, inspiring owner Robert Schroeder to dedicate a line of wines to the lost dino's, called the Saurus Selection. He established a section of the wine cellar that displays the bones and replicas of the eggs. While, the central cellar sector showcases artwork and hosts concerts.In 2001, Schroeder planted its first vines and did first its bottling two years later. More recently, in 2009, they partnered with Paul Hobbs, California winemaker-turned consultant to several wineries in South America, to create Alto Limay, aiming to appeal to the American market and palate. Our final day was spent at Bodega NQN, a contemporary winery and restaurant with a hipster feel. They craft two lines of wine, NQN and Del Fin Del Mundo. With refreshing pink grapefruit, NQN Sauvignon Blanc had balance and liveliness and the un-oaked Chardonnay was clean and bright with white peach. While, NQN single vineyard Pinot Noir and single vineyard Cabernet Franc were my favorites. The latter, packed racy black cherry and dirty leather with a delicate edge and was a palate pleaser with my grilled salmon and wild mushrooms meal."

""Your metabolism is like a fire: If you don't add wood, your metabolism will die down. If you don't eat regularly, your body doesn't have fuel and your metabolism will slow down.

And most people will have two to three cups.Whole grains: ""High-fiber foods take your body longer to digest, which helps speed up metabolism due to the thermic effect of food. Whole grains like brown rice, oats, quinoa, and barley are very high in fiber. For packaged foods, make sure that the words 'whole grain' appear in the ingredient label and don't fall for the word 'multi-grain.'

""But don't limit yourself to just these because all vegetables have fiber and your body needs a variety of nutrients.""Raspberries: ""Any fruits with edible seeds or skin like raspberries, blackberries, and pears are especially high in fiber. Don't worry about the sugar in fruit because it's a natural source of sugar.""Chiles: ""Spicy foods from hot peppers to chili powder have capsaicin, which has been shown to increase the release of adrenaline and raise body temperature. When your body temperature goes up, it speeds up the metabolism. The kicker is that you need a good amount of capsaicin to increase body temperature, so I recommend adding a small spicy element (like salsa or jalapenos) to each meal instead of a large amount at one meal.""Cold Water: ""Drinking five to eight glasses per day of very cold water helps speed up the metabolism because your body has to use energy to warm the water back up to your normal body temperature, 98 degrees.""See more from Epicurious:  5 Surprising Immunity Boosting Foods for Cold and Flu Season  5 Winter Superfoods That Are Cheap and Easy-to-Find Too! 6 Superfoods You Might Want To Reconsider Meet Kaniwa, The New Quinoa"

The family of a 13-year-old California girl who was declared brain dead after a tonsillectomy said Monday they will sue to keep her on life support. Family spokesman Omari Sealey, the uncle of Jahi McMath, disclosed the plan to seek a restraining order against the hospital where the girl is on a breathing machine. Under an order issued on Dec. 24 by a state judge, Jahi could be removed from a ventilator at Children's Hospital of Oakland at 5 p.m. PST. (AP Photo/Courtesy of McMath Family and Omari Sealey, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dc0a4240000320053b667.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The family of Jahi McMath is reportedly receiving advice from a group linked to Terri Schiavo as they fight to keep the 13-year-old on life support.McMath was declared brain dead on Dec. 12 after undergoing a tonsillectomy at Children's Hospital Oakland in California. The operation was supposed to help treat McMath's sleep apnea and other issues, but during her recovery, the teen began to bleed heavily and eventually went into cardiac arrest, the Associated Press reports. Three days later she was declared brain dead.Despite the doctors' diagnosis, McMath's family has been fighting to keep the child on life support in the hope that she may eventually recover. Now it appears the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network has quietly joined the McMaths in an effort to keep the teen on her ventilator. Indeed, the Network's website is currently filled with updates on McMath's case and features a column by conservative pundit Michelle Malkin in support of McMath's parents.Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman who went into a coma in 1990, was at the center of protracted right-to-die battle that pitted her husband, Michael, against her parents and other family members. The acrimonious and very public fight ended in 2005 when her spouse finally removed her feeding tube. ""Together with our team of experts, Terri's Network believes Jahi's case is representative of a very deep problem within the U.S. healthcare system -- particularly those issues surrounding the deaths of patients within the confines of hospital corporations, which have a vested financial interest in discontinuing life,"" the group said in a prepared statement, according to CNN.Bobby Schindler, Schiavo's brother and executive director of the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network, was also quoted in the statement.""Families and individuals must make themselves aware of what so-called 'brain death' is and what it is not,"" Schindler said. ""Every person needs to understand that medical accidents happen every day. Families and individuals must be more aware of the issue of accountability and patient rights.""The McMath family won a small victory on Dec. 30, after Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo ruled that Children's Hospital Oakland must keep McMath on a ventilator until Jan. 7."

But give me a sandwich or anything eaten out of hand and I turn into a two-year-old without a bib. Juicy hamburgers, especially with slithery toppings, are a particular problem. Beef fat (and bacon fat if applicable), melted cheese, fried-onion grease, ketchup: A lot of this is going to wind up tangled in my beard and some of it, on occasion, will need to be extracted from my lapel by the dry cleaner. Part of the problem for me, if for no one else, is the shape of the normal hamburger: a round patty on a round bun doesn't provide a leading edge for me to get started on. Yes, I know: I can and sometimes do cut the thing in half. That helps a bit, but the laundry bill suggests that it is evidently not enough.Since I am in whining mode, I'll also lament the super-sizing of the hot dog bun (bear with me: this is pertinent). The best ones I can buy are made by local bread bakers, not by big industrial bakeries. They are light but sturdy, and they taste good: on the way to being brioche, though not as delicate. But they are gigantic: too thick and too long. A normal wiener is lost in their embrace, and the bread-to-sausage ratio is all askew.Contemplating these cucumber-sized rolls, however, it occurred to me that they might be just the ticket for hamburgers of a sort. Unlike, say, chicken legs, hamburgers have no inherent form; they really can be any shape at all. So I made a couple of them to fit the buns - trimmings from a good brisket I'd bought at Dickson's Farmstand Meats in Manhattan's Chelsea Market, with a little hard white fat ground in to enrich it.They took no special care in the cooking, although I used a long, narrow offset spatula from the pastry cupboard to turn them in the skillet, and they really did solve my problem. Jackie, of course, never makes a mess at the table, but she too found the longer, narrower hamburger easier to handle and more fun to eat. This is the only way I'll ever cook a hamburger again, even if it means a downturn in the New York dry cleaning industry for 2014."
