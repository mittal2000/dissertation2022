Yet few Americans question the sanity or cult-like behavior of American presidents as they continue to seek solutions to complex issues by bombing Iraq (as well as numerous other countries across the globe).Poor Iraq. From Operation Desert Shield/Storm under George H.W. Bush to enforcing no-fly zones under Bill Clinton to Operation Iraqi Freedom under George W. Bush to the latest “humanitarian” bombing under Barack Obama, the one constant is American bombs bursting in Iraqi desert air. Yet despite this bombing -- or rather in part because of it -- Iraq is a devastated and destabilized country, slowly falling apart at seams that have been unraveling under almost a quarter-century of steady, at times relentless, pounding. “Shock and awe,” anyone?Well, I confess to being shocked: that U.S. airpower assets, including strategic bombers like B-52s and B-1s, built during the Cold War to deter and, if necessary, attack that second planetary superpower, the Soviet Union, have routinely been used to attack countries that are essentially helpless to defend themselves from bombing.In 1985, when I entered active duty as an Air Force lieutenant, if you had asked me which country the U.S. would “have” to bomb in four sustained aerial campaigns spanning three decades, among the last countries I would have suggested was Iraq. Heck, back then we were still helping Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran, sharing intelligence that aided his military in pinpointing (and using his chemical weapons against) Iranian troop concentrations. The Reagan administration had sent future Bush secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld there to shake Saddam’s hand for a photo op. We even overlooked Iraq’s “accidental” bombing in 1987 of a American naval vessel, the USS Stark, that resulted in the death of 37 American sailors, all in the name of containing Iran (and Shia revolutionary fervor).It’s said that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, but Saddam didn’t remain a friend for long. Emboldened by U.S. support in his war with Iran, he took Kuwait, only to initiate the first round of devastating U.S. air raids against his military during Desert Shield/Storm in 1990-1991. As these and subsequent bombing campaigns damaged and debilitated Iraq, contributing to Saddam’s overthrow in 2003, the Shia majority in that country found common cause with Iran, strengthening one branch of militant Islam. At the same time, the general destabilization of Iraq from a generation of air war and invasion has led to a Sunni revolt, the strengthening of an al-Qaeda-style movement, and the establishment of a “caliphate” across significant parts of Iraq (and Syria).Now, given that less-than-stellar record, does anyone want to hazard a guess about the next American response to peoples and leaders our government doesn’t like in Iraq or the rest of the Middle East? My money is on more bombing, which surely requires explanation.Cranking Out BombersIf one weapon captured the image of the former Soviet Union, it was the main battle tank. From T-34s during World War II to T-72s near the end of the Cold War, the Russians cranked them out like sausages. And if one weapon captured the image of the U.S., then and now, it has surely been the bomber, whether of the strategic or heavy variety (think B-52) or the tactical or fighter-bomber variety (think the F-105 in the Vietnam years, the F-15 “Strike Eagle” in Iraq, and for the future, the most expensive weapons system of all time, the F-35). As the richer superpower, the U.S. cranked out high-tech bombers like so many high-priced sausages. “The bomber will always get through.” That article of faith, first expressed in 1932 by Stanley Baldwin, thrice Prime Minister of Britain, was seized upon by U.S. airpower enthusiasts in the run-up to World War II. Despite decidedly mixed and disappointing results ever since, bombing remains the go-to choice for American commanders-in-chief.What we need in 2014 is a new expression that catches the essence of the cult of U.S. air power, something like: “The bomber will always get funded -- and used.”Let’s tackle the first half of that equation: the bomber will always get funded. Skeptical? What else captures the reality (as well as the folly) of dedicating more than $400 billion to the F-35 fighter-bomber program, a wildly over-budget and underperforming weapons system that may, in the end, cost the American taxpayer $1.5 trillion. Yes, you read that right. Or the persistence of U.S. plans to build yet another long-range “strike” bomber to augment and replace the B-1 and B-2 fleet? It’s a “must-have,” according to the Air Force, if the U.S. is to maintain its “full-spectrum dominance” on Planet Earth. Already pegged at an estimated price of $550 million per plane while still on the drawing boards, it’s just about guaranteed to replace the F-35 in the record books, when it comes to delays, cost overruns, and price. And if you don’t think it’ll get funded, you don’t know recent history.Heck, I get it. I was a teenager once. In the 1970s, as an Air Force enthusiast and child of the Cold War, I hugged exotic and therefore pricey bomber jets to my chest. (Well, models of them, anyway.) I considered them to be both uniquely American and an absolute necessity when it came to defending our country against the lumbering (but nevertheless menacing) Soviet “bear.” As a result, I gasped in 1977 when President Jimmy Carter dared to cancel the B-1 bomber program. While I was a little young to pen my outrage, more mature critics than I quickly accused him of being soft on defense, of pursuing “unilateral disarmament.”Back then, I’d built a model of the B-1 bomber. In my mind’s eye I still see its sexy white body and its rakish swing wings. No question that it was a man’s bomber. I recall attaching a firecracker to its body, lighting the wick, and dropping the plane from the third-floor porch. It exploded in mid-air, symbolic to me of the plane’s tragic fate at the hands of the pusillanimous Carter. But I need not have feared for the B-1. In October 1981, as one of his first major acts in office, President Ronald Reagan rescinded Carter’s cancellation and revived the mothballed program. The Air Force eventually bought 100 of the planes for $28 billion, expensive at the time (and called a “turkey” by some), but a relative bargain in the present budgetary environment when it comes to bombers (but these days, little else). At that point, I was a young lieutenant serving on active duty in the Air Force. I had by then come to learn that Carter, the peanut farmer (and former Navy nuclear engineer), was right. We really didn’t need the B-1 for our defense. In 1986, for a contest at Peterson Air Force Base where I was stationed, I wrote a paper against the B-1, terming the idea of a “penetrating strategic bomber” a “flawed strategy” in an era of long-range air-launched cruise missiles. It earned an honorable mention, the equivalent of drawing the “you have won second prize in a beauty contest” card in Monopoly, but without the compensatory $10.That “penetrating,” by the way, meant being loaded with expensive avionics, nowadays augmented by budget-busting “stealth” features, so that a plane could theoretically penetrate enemy air defenses while eluding detection. If the idea of producing such a bomber was flawed in the 1980s, how much more is it today, in an age of remotely-piloted drones and missiles guided by GPS and in a world in which no country the U.S. chooses to bomb is likely to have air defenses of any sophistication? Yet the Air Force insists that it needs at least 100 of the next generation version of them at a cost of $55 billion. (Based on experience, especially with the F-35, you should automatically double or even triple that price tag, cost overruns and product development delays being a given in the process. So let’s say it’ll cost closer to $150 billion. Check back with me, God willing, in 2040 to see whether the Air Force’s figure or mine was closer to reality.)Idols for Worship, Urges to SatisfyObviously, there are staggering amounts of money to be made by feeding America’s fetish for bombers. But the U.S. cult of air power and its wildly expensive persistence requires further explanation. On one level, exotic and expensive attack planes like the F-35 or the future “long range strike bomber” (LRS-B in bloodless acronym-speak) are the military equivalent of sacred cows. They are idols to be worshipped (and funded) without question. But they are also symptoms of a larger disease -- the engorgement of the Department of Defense. In the post-9/11 world, this has become so pronounced that the military-industrial-congressional complex clearly believes it is entitled to a trough filled with money with virtually no accountability to the American taxpayer.Add to that sense of entitlement the absurdist faith of administration after administration in the efficacy of bombing as a problem solver -- despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary -- and you have a truly lethal combo. Senator John McCain was widely mocked by progressives for his “bomb Iran” song, warbled during the 2008 presidential campaign to the tune of the Beach Boys's ""Barbara Ann."" In fact, his tuneless rendition captured perfectly Washington’s absolute faith in bombing as a solution to... whatever.Even if the bombs bursting over Iraq or elsewhere don’t solve anything, even when they make things worse, they still make a president look, well, presidential. In America, land of warbirds, it is always better politically to pose as a hunting hawk than a helpless dove.So don’t blame the Air Force for wanting more and deadlier bombers. Or don’t blame only them. Just as admirals want more ships, flyboys naturally want more planes, even when strategically obsolete from scratch and blazingly expensive. No military service has ever willingly given up even a tiny slice of its share of the prospective budgetary pie, especially if that slice cuts into the service’s core image. In this sense, the Air Force takes its motto from King Lear's “Reason not the need!” and from Zack Mayo's “I want to fly jets!” (memorably uttered by that great Shakespearean actor Richard Gere in An Officer and a Gentleman).The sad truth runs deeper: Americans evidently want them, too. More bombers. More bombs. In the movie Top Gun, Tom Cruise’s Maverick got it all wrong. It’s not speed Americans feel a need for; they have an urge to bomb. When you refuse to reason, when you persist in investing ever more resources in ever more planes, use almost automatically follows. In other words, fund it, build it, and, as promised in the second half of my equation, the bomber will always get used. Mock him all you want, but John McCain was on to something. It’s bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb bomb if not (yet) Iran... then Iraq, or Pakistan, or Libya, or Yemen, or (insert intransigent foreign country/peoples here).And like cults everywhere, it’s best not to question the core belief and practices of its leaders -- after all, bombs bursting in air is now as American as the ""Star Spangled Banner.""William Astore, a retired lieutenant colonel (USAF), is a TomDispatch regular who edits the blog The Contrary Perspective.Follow TomDispatch on Twitter and join us on Facebook and Tumblr.

5,POLITICS,White House And Congressional Democrats Spin Through Another Cycle Of Psychodrama,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congressional-democrats-obama_n_5692754.html,,2014-08-19,"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nev. pauses as he faces reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, March 5, 2014, after bipartisan Senate opposition blocked swift confirmation for President Barack Obama's choice to head the Justice Department's Civil Rights division. The vote against advancing Debo Adegbile toward confirmation was 47-52, short of the majority needed under new procedures Democrats put in place earlier this year to overcome Republican stalling tactics. In this case, all 44 voting Republicans and eight Democrats lined up to block confirmation, leaving the nomination is grave jeopardy. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d30c3c000020010df864.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How to solve a problem like the White House relationship with Congress? And why should I be involved -- aren't these people supposedly adults? These are two questions I am asking myself today, because despite the fact that a few months ago, congressional Democrats were loudly signaling, ""Stay away from us, Mr. President! Please remain aloof,"" congressional Democrats are now really super-emotional about the extent to which President Barack Obama has remained aloof, per their previous instructions.Let's try to explore how to help all of these emotional basket cases to get a grip on things.A June meeting in the Oval Office between the president and ""the four top lawmakers in Congress"" to discuss Iraq provides the anecdotal basis for stories by The Associated Press and The New York Times. Per the Times:With Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, sitting a few feet away, Mr. Reid complained that Senate Republicans were spitefully blocking the confirmation of dozens of Mr. Obama’s nominees to serve as ambassadors. He expected that the president would back him up and urge Mr. McConnell to relent.Reid, apparently upset that Obama did not opt for the Real Housewives Of New Jersey table-flip he was offering, ""seethed quietly."" And after Reid spent some time with a tiny cartoon storm cloud over his head, his office apparently decided to talk to reporters about it. According to the White House, Obama later made a call to McConnell to talk about the ambassadorial logjam. Personally, I think, ""You and Mitch work it out,"" is a pretty explicit instruction, but maybe I need to check my emotional stability privilege to really understand how Congress works.Much of what Congress wants doesn't seem, at first blush, to be serious. Its members would like to be invited to more social gatherings, and be more ""gregarious."" The Times reports that those lawmakers who are invited to such things don't always show up (""Twelve [Democratic Senators] were invited to a St. Patrick’s Day reception this year ... but only one showed up""), so it would appear that Obama has to invite them much harder, on hand-printed stationery, or something.Also, Obama is not giving members of Congress enough opportunity to bask in glory:Members of Congress are usually invited to Mr. Obama’s speeches, but they sit in the audience. The result is that Democratic members are robbed of a triumphant picture with the president that they can show their family members, while the White House sacrifices the loyalty of a once grateful lawmaker.There are those on Capitol Hill who offer a certain refreshingly mature take on this matter, like Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), who tells The Hill: “[With] some of my colleagues, I feel like I'm back in high school, right? It's, 'Oh, he didn't smile at me. He didn't do a photo with me. He didn't invite me to the Super Bowl party,’” Quigley said. “Who cares? What are you, 12? … We've got important stuff to do.”Quigley should probably mention the existence of ""important stuff to do"" to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who shows up in The New York Times' piece, clucking like so:Asked to characterize his relationship with the president, Mr. Manchin, a centrist Democrat who has often been a bridge builder in the Senate, said: “It’s fairly nonexistent. There’s not much of a relationship.”Manchin probably hasn't come round to the understanding that he cemented a nonexistent relationship with the White House when he turned tail and abandoned his post during the 2010 lame duck session at a time when the White House was working hard to pass the Dream Act and end ""Don't Ask Don't Tell."" Manchin opted instead to attend a Christmas party. But it was probably an important Christmas party. Maybe Christmas almost didn't even happen. Good thing Joe Manchin was there, in West Virginia, to save Christmas. Why doesn't the White House get that?But, apparently, not all of this tension is founded on trivial concerns. Both The Associated Press and The Hill contend that this strained relationship flared most seriously in recent weeks, as Congress struggled to solve the crisis of unaccompanied, undocumented immigrant minors on the border. Per The Hill:More recently, the administration's message on the southern border crisis emerged bearing mixed signals about what new powers Obama was seeking to expedite the deportation of unaccompanied migrant kids. Amid the confusion, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Democrats were prepared to swallow changes to a 2008 human trafficking law in return for the border funding, a position she quickly reversed following an outcry from immigrant rights advocates wary of eroding the legal protections for those kids.To be honest with you, I'm not sure that what happened in Congress related to the border crisis deserves to be shoehorned into a narrative about the White House relationship with Capitol Hill Democrats. A better example of a legitimate beef between Congressional Democrats and the Obama administration is the bungled launch of the Affordable Care Act's online apparatus -- which blindsided Democratic members and cost them political capital. But the recent immigration wranglings didn't really hinge on an inadequate number of social occasions. Let's recall what actually happened, shall we?July 2, 2014: The administration quietly floats the idea that it wants to ""change a 2008 law that dictates how the federal government handles those immigrant children in order to speed up their deportations."" The change would involve empowering Border Patrol agents to expedite deportations, instead of bringing in the Department of Health and Human Services.July 14, 2014: Congressional Democrats aren't happy about it. The White House and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) have a big fight about it.July 28, 2014: The White House says, ""Sure, Congressional Democrats, whatever you want, we are behind you."" What Congressional Democrats want to do is pass ""an emergency spending measure that would provide an additional $2.7 billion in funding for the crisis on the Texas border."" The White House still wants to change the 2008 law, but is willing to hold off for the time being.Meanwhile ...: Republicans take up their position on the matter. Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) have a bill in the Senate that would address the 2008 bill, said Cornyn. House Republicans, meanwhile, made it clear that they'd refuse to support any immigration bill that did not change the 2008 law. The GOP's version wouldn't fund this solution at the level Obama originally sought, but as Cornyn put it, ""A solution beats no solution every day."" Boehner reckons he can get his caucus behind the bill, which by now is known as the traditional prelude to disappointment. Sure enough ...July 31, 2014: Boehner pulls the bill after it becomes obvious that his members won't support it. As per usual, the Ted Cruz Rebel Alliance is involved. ""With almost no Democratic support, Boehner needed to corral votes virtually entirely from within his own Republican caucus, and he faced a group of House conservatives who worked hand-in-hand with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in plotting their strategy to bring down the legislation in pursuit of a more purely conservative approach."" But things get worse from the point of view of the White House, because ...Aug. 1, 2014: Everyone in the GOP insists on passing something, and the thing they pass is a measure that repeals the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.So that is what happened with that. And guess what we've learned? No amount of schmoozery between the White House and Democratic congresspersons could have altered this dynamic. Obama could have wooed and cajoled, convinced the entire Democratic caucus to back his plan to change the 2008 law, or come together completely to work on their alternative. Steaks could have been had. Golf could have been played. Love could have been made. Really romantic love, with attentive foreplay and post-coital cuddles. All of that may, indeed, be critically important for the sake of governing. On this widely cited occasion, however, it would not have changed a blessed thing. In the end, House Republicans still would not have done much of anything, unless it included repealing the administration's signature immigration policy achievement -- DACA. Sorry! Maybe next time.

John Kirby, said the Defense Department has not made any decision to suspend the program -- but that Hagel ultimately has the authority to do so.The federal government has also provided grants to local police departments that have allowed them to buy billions of dollars' worth of military equipment. Critics say the policy has contributed to increasingly militarized police forces around the country.The protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in response to the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown have been met by a police force fully equipped with tear gas, tactical body armor and Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles often used in war zones.Kirby said the Pentagon has provided the Ferguson Police Department with three vehicles and a generator under the program. It has also provided the St. Louis County Police Department with gear, including a helicopter and rifles.While several lawmakers have recently advocated for police demilitarization, Congress has been hesitant to scale back the defense program. The House voted down an amendment in June that would have blocked funding for some types of equipment.The Senate Armed Services Committee will review the matter when it considers the Defense Department's next budget bill, Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said last week."

(These days, you can't be president without sending in the bombers and drones.) So let's try to get our heads around the latest U.S. air strikes in northern Iraq against the forces of the new ""caliphate."" It's a campaign that President Obama has already indicated is likely to go on for months and may soon enough spread south to the Baghdad area. It looks like Washington has finally created the perfect machine for the weapons industry.Think of it this way: First Washington provides the Iraqi military with training and massive infusions of military equipment to the tune of $25 billion. Next that military, faced with its first serious opposition, the militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), numbering in the thousands against security forces in the hundreds of thousands, collapses. In June, two full divisions, 30,000 Iraqi troops, flee the city of Mosul, abandoning their posts in the face of the advance of ISIS fighters. In all, four divisions of the country's 14-division army disintegrate throughout the north. Left behind is a massive trove of U.S.-supplied weaponry, including 1,500 Humvees, 52 U.S.-made M198 howitzers, tanks, trucks, rifles, and ammunition.ISIS militants, who seem remarkably capable of operating such equipment without an American trainer or adviser in sight, then turn some of that weaponry (as well as weapons captured from the Syrian military) on U.S.-backed forces, including, in the north, Kurdish pesh merga militias. (They have evidently even brought tanks into play near the Turkish border.) To save its Kurdish allies from disaster, the Obama administration then sends in the U.S. Air Force (both fighter-bombers and Predator drones) in close support of the beleaguered Kurdish forces. Doing what air power seems most capable of, the planes begin destroying the armored vehicles and artillery pieces ISIS has brought to bear in Kurdish areas. In other words, U.S. air power is called in to take out U.S. military equipment (and anyone manning it).To complete the circle, both the Iraqis defending Baghdad and the Kurds now desperately need new weaponry, and Washington is already starting to supply it in the north and soon undoubtedly in the south as well. Can there be any question that this is a win-win situation for the American arms industry and the military-industrial complex? It gives new meaning to American bombing campaigns that, since 1991, have proven to be disastrous regional destabilizers. Think of this as an innovative profit center for American industry and a jobs-creation exercise of the first order: we provide the weapons, we destroy them, then we provide more.Given Astore's ""cult"" of bombing and its remarkable futility in policy terms, this is a significant development. And don't for a second think that it's a one-of-a-kind situation. After all, Washington has put at least $50 billion in weaponry and training into Afghanistan's security forces. So the future is bright."

In a calendar full of important days, this one is very close to my heart because it is the one day in the year when we focus our attention on humanitarian workers and the dangerous and difficult work they are often asked to do. It's a day when we remember, commemorate and pay tribute to the unsung heroes of humanitarian work. On August 19, 2003, the headquarters of the United Nations in Baghdad was bombed, killing 22 people, including the head of our operations in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello. The attack was a senseless waste of human life. We lost colleagues whose families and friends still mourn them. The bombing forced the United Nations to reduce its humanitarian work in Iraq, so it was not only an attack on the UN it was also an attack on the ordinary Iraqis who needed the food, clean water, medicine and shelter that humanitarian workers were providing in Iraq. Attacks on humanitarian aid workers are attacks on humanitarian aid itself, and indirectly, they are attacks on the ordinary people who bear the brunt of modern warfare: people who are living through crisis, who have lost everything including their homes and friends; people who are struggling for their very survival. The United Nations was founded from the ashes of war and conventions have been agreed to ensure that when there is war, civilians are protected. But in modern warfare, which is often waged between armed groups civilians are seen as expendable. So often the international community has said 'enough' and 'never again' as we watch the brutality meted out to ordinary people caught in the midst of violent conflict. But this year alone we have seen civilians come under attack or become the casualties of conflict in Syria, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Gaza. And aid workers are also targets. Delivering humanitarian aid is becoming more difficult and dangerous every year. Attacks on aid workers have increased steadily since 2003 and last year, they reached an all-time high. More than 150 aid workers were killed as they tried to bring help to people in crisis. Some 170 more were seriously injured and more than 140 kidnapped. In the past month alone, thirty humanitarian aid workers were killed in Gaza and six in South Sudan. The only way we can begin to reverse this trend is by ensuring accountability and pursuing those responsible for these despicable crimes, which are in total violation of the Geneva Conventions and all humanitarian and human rights laws. The international community must find ways to strengthen the implementation and observance of these laws. There must be an end to impunity. This year on World Humanitarian Day, we are calling on all governments to live up to their commitments to protect humanitarian staff and hold accountable those who attack them.

For example doctors, nurses, teachers, drivers, agriculture specialists, engineers and administrators. Many of them work in their own communities and have lived through crisis. They know exactly what people are going through. For many that's what motivated them to go into humanitarian work. They are committed and they care. They will go the extra mile. Humanitarian aid workers should not have to risk their own lives in order to save the lives of others. This World Humanitarian Day I encourage you to become a Messenger for Humanity.

Last year marked the most violent year for aid organizations in the past decade: 155 relief staff were killed, 171 were injured, and 134 were kidnapped. This is always a sobering day, but is all the more so this year as we mourn the six aid workers just recently murdered in South Sudan and the many health care staff in West Africa who have sacrificed their lives treating those with Ebola.   World Humanitarian Day also gives humanitarians an opportunity to pause and take stock. Reflection is particularly important this year, as the global humanitarian system -- made up of governments, UN agencies, and local and international NGOs -- faces unprecedented challenges. Crises this year in Syria, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan have pushed us all to the limit. And new crises continue to pile on: in just the few weeks from when I began thinking about this article to when I actually sat down to write it, two more major crises -- the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the horrifying conflict in Iraq -- have jumped onto the world's front pages.   The international humanitarian system hasn't been stretched like this since at least the mid-1990s, when one of the worst genocides in history claimed the lives of an estimated 800,000 people in Rwanda, even as ethnic tensions in the former Yugoslavia exploded into a years-long regional war characterized by mass atrocities and the displacement of millions across the Balkans. But the current challenges are arguably worse; while more than four million people required humanitarian aid during the Bosnian war, more than double that number -- 10 million people -- are currently in need in Syria alone.  In spite of these enormous needs, I see encouraging examples of the progress we have made in the past 20 years. To contend with the unprecedented challenges we face, USAID and its partners across the global humanitarian system are working together to find innovative ways of delivering life-saving assistance to the world's most vulnerable people.In South Sudan, a country facing one of the most severe food shortages in the world, we have been actively working to mitigate the worst possible scenario of hunger. Advances in famine forecasting over the past two decades have enabled us to spot danger signs and deploy aid earlier, combating severe food insecurity before it can develop into full blown famine. As a result, our partners have been massively scaling up relief efforts to reach the most hard-hit areas by road, river and air. And we are seeing evidence that this preemptive scale up is making a significant difference in decreasing malnutrition rates and other warning signs of potential famine.  The response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines showed the challenges of providing aid amidst massive logistical constraints. But it also showed how lessons learned from past partnerships with military actors improved overall coordination. For years, USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance -- the Office I lead -- has honed our mechanisms for engaging the military's unique capabilities in extreme circumstances. During the typhoon, this investment paid off as we were able to clear enormous logistical hurdles and deliver 2,500 tons of critical emergency supplies to areas cut off by the storm.  In the Syria crisis, however, we continue to see remnants of some of the fundamental challenges we faced two decades ago. Conflict rages on without a political solution, while humanitarian needs continue to grow. Though we stand steadfast in our dedication to help the Syrian people, the reality is that no amount of humanitarian assistance will end the fighting. Absent a political solution, the international humanitarian community bumps up against the limits of what aid can achieve in the midst of a war zone.  World Humanitarian Day is also, finally, a day to celebrate the courage and perseverance of all humanitarian workers who continue to work on the front lines at great personal risk to reach the people and places most in need. Despite the unparalleled challenges and obstacles we face while doing our jobs, we honor the sacrifices of those we have lost by continuing to serve the mission for which they courageously gave their lives.This post is part of a five-part series produced by The Huffington Post, USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, and the NGO alliance InterAction to commemorate World Humanitarian Day. World Humanitarian Day (August 19) honors aid workers who have lost their lives helping the millions of people affected by disasters around the world. This past year has seen four large-scale ""Level 3"" humanitarian crises -- Syria, Central African Republic (CAR), South Sudan and the Philippines -- that are stretching the capacity of the humanitarian system.

Sprigg, who is a Senior Fellow for Policy Studies at the FRC, suggests that ""socially liberal political activists"" should try to outlaw the type of rehab Williams had reportedly received for drug and alcohol abuse in the past, because they are ""trying to ban [another] form of mental health treatment"" in the way of reparative, or ""ex-gay,"" therapy. He writes: Whatever the motivation, there are those who have simply made a choice to walk away from the homosexual lifestyle, without clinical help — much like how Robin Williams simply stopped using drugs and alcohol in the 1980s. Others have sought professional help, perhaps at the urging of family members, in the form of “sexual reorientation therapy” — much like when Williams entered a formal alcohol rehab program in 2006. Noting that there is ""no scientific evidence that reorientation therapy is more harmful than helpful,"" he adds: If it is tolerable for some people to try to change from “gay” to straight — and for others to help them with the process — that might imply that it is tolerable to believe that there is something wrong with homosexuality itself. For ideological reasons, that is a belief that homosexual activists want stamped out at all costs. You can read Spriggs' entire blog post here. The tone of the post isn't particularly surprising given Spriggs' history. Earlier this year, he advised a mother to pursue organizations which advocate for reparative therapy for her married daughter, who recently came out of the closet, in a radio segment.Last year, Sprigg suggested that gay parents should not be legally protected against parental kidnappings while discussing the controversial case of Lisa Miller, who ultimately fled the country with her young daughter, Isabella, in order to prevent her former lesbian partner from gaining custody.On Aug. 11, the Westboro Baptist Church announced plans to picket Williams' funeral after labeling the actor a ""Fag Pimp.""

This approach involves the therapist's suggestion of various films that relate to the issues the client wants to address. Film's power to help and to heal, and therefore complement that therapeutic process, may be one of the most interesting aspects of practicing psychotherapy. In this realm, Robin Williams has contributed immensely to my professional performance. His characters seemed remarkably human and believable. I've suggested many of his meaningful films to therapy clients: The Fisher King, The World According to Garp, and even Mrs. Doubtfire. I routinely encourage clients to watch Good Will Hunting, which stands out as one of the most interesting and psychologically sophisticated films about intimacy. Monday morning, a client in her 50s was expressing her anxiety about spending time in the evenings with a new boyfriend after many years on her own. I suggested that she watch Good Will Hunting. I then did my best to describe a particular scene in the film that takes place between therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and client Will Hunting (Matt Damon) in which Williams gives a riveting and hilarious description of intimacy. My client smiled and we laughed together about the scene, and she made a note in her phone to watch the movie sometime soon.Little did I know that on Tuesday I would be listening in tears to the same exact scene on NPR today when Terry Gross's 2006 Fresh Air interview was re-aired to mark William's tragic death at age 63:Will: [about Skylar] This girl is like, you know, beautiful. She's smart. She's funny. She's different from most of the girls I've been with.Many people enter therapy because they are struggling to make a decision about commitment. Or maybe they are experiencing anxiety about getting close to someone for the first time. Sometimes, getting close to a romantic partner can produce tremendous anxiety, especially for those who have not been exposed to healthy, intimate relationships. Directed by Gus Van Sant, Good Will Hunting is an intense and inspiring coming-of-age film about friendship, loyalty, and living up to one's potential. It is also a remarkable exploration of intimacy and fear of commitment. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck became overnight celebrities as the writers and co-stars of this film for which they shared the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. And Robin Williams won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a product of the foster care system living on the South Side of Boston and working as a janitor at MIT. He begins solving complex equations on the blackboard that have rendered the elite university students stumped. It turns out that Will Hunting possesses the kind of mathematical genius that comes along once in a lifetime. After assaulting a police officer, Will represents himself in court and avoids jail time by agreeing (reluctantly) to meet regularly with a therapist. To say that Will resists his work with therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) is something of an understatement. The therapy is somewhat unconventional, and the breakthrough moment is an over-simplification of the therapeutic process; however, the therapy serves as a remarkable backdrop for an exploration of intimacy, fear of commitment, and the human struggle to live up to one's potential. What is unusual about this film is its ability to explore intimacy and commitment in a way that feels honest and real. The intimacy that transpires between Sean and Will functions as a model and a catalyst for Will's emotional healing. This film demonstrates that sometimes the most important aspects of parenting may not take place with a biological parent. The human ability to connect on an intimate level with friends, mentors and teachers may fill gaps that parents have been unavailable or otherwise unable to provide. Sometimes people who were not properly protected or nurtured by their biological parents figure out ways to meet these unmet needs through developing formative relationships with parent figures so that they do not get stuck in unhealthy patterns and instead develop the ability to experience intimacy and live up to their potential.If you are struggling with the question of whether to take an intimate relationship to the next level, viewing Good Will Hunting could be a worthwhile step in your decision making process. If you are grieving the loss of one of the most gifted actors of all time, this film features some of his best and most beautiful work.Many of my therapy clients expressed profound sadness over William's apparent suicide. His art, his talent and his aura helped people feel less isolated and more hopeful."
