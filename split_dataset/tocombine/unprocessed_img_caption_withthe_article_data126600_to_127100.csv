In a way, it's a redhead holiday, since being a redhead is strongly associated with the Irish; even though most Irish are dark haired with brown/blue eyes! Soon, we'll begin to see t-shirts and pins with ""Luck of the Irish"" stamped over them. Some many not believe in ""luck,"" but many say it's lucky to rub your hand on a redhead's head because the color is so rare. This year, whether they're true or not, we decided to embrace the many myths of St. Patrick's Day and it's association with redheads. Why not?!  We're pretty awesome and lucky to be blessed with red hair. Here are 10 ways redheads are Go N-Eiri An T-Adh Leat ('Lucky' in Gaelic-Irish): 1. With over 7 billion people in this world, it is very easy to blend in and not be noticed. Luckily for redheads, we stand out in every crowd! 2. A long time rumor has suggested that redheads are going extinct. Luckily for redheads, that is in fact a myth. We aren't going anywhere.3. With so many beauty and fashion websites there, how do you choose? Redheads do not have the typical skin or coloring, and finding advice can take hours! Luckily for redheads, there is HowtobeaRedhead.com. 4. Brown, black, blonde hair accessories seem to crowd the beauty aisles. Luckily for redheads, there are now redhead bobby pins, hair ties and bun makers on the market! 5. Luckily for redheads, we can blame our outrages on our ""fiery tempers.""6. Redheads, do you ever spot another redhead on the street? Luckily for us, you automatically smile at each other and feel like it's a secret club. 7. Luckily for redheads, you don't have to go overboard with accessories and colors. Your hair stands out on its own. 8. Many think having pale skin and freckles isn't ""cool."" But, for women who take care of their skin and apply sunscreen, redheads always seem to look the youngest! In Ireland, it's very popular to apply Vitamin E oil directly on the skin. It's reported to be a natural anti-aging vitamin. 9. What other hair color can say they have a beauty/fashion tour designed for them? Only redheads! How to Be a Redhead will soon be presenting the live, red carpet Rock it like a Redhead Beauty Tour. 10. Let's be honest, redheads are the coolest. We make up only two percent of the world's population, and being super unique is definitely something to be proud of... whether you're lucky or not.

1,WEDDINGS,5 Money Issues to Discuss Before the Wedding Day,"Chris Easter, Contributor
Co-Founder, The Man Registry",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-money-issues-to-discuss_us_5b9deb33e4b03a1dcc8ebda7,Are we starting in debt? Discovering that your spouse has debt that's been kept a secret is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb,2014-03-10,2014-03-10-bigstock_Saving_Money_In_Your_Change_Ja_7260612.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-03-10-bigstock_Saving_Money_In_Your_Change_Ja_7260612-thumb.jpg,"Talking about money might not be as fun as discussing the songs your reception band will play or the tropical location in which you'll be honeymooning, but it's truly one of the most important pre-wedding talks you'll have.You're probably aware that finances are one of the issues married couples argue about the most. To make matters worse, these types of arguments have also been attributed as the leading cause of divorce in the United States. Like any issue in a relationship, the best course of action is to have an early discussion to get ahead of any potential problems before they arise. To help you get started, here are five money-related conversations to have with your future spouse before the big day:Will we be combining assets? Many couples will combine their checking, savings and investment accounts after the wedding. By doing so, the couple will have a much clearer view of their financial standing and be able to tackle major purchases as a team. For those who need a little time to ease into the ""what's mine is yours"" way of thinking, it's also perfectly acceptable to form one joint account while also keeping other separate accounts. Neither way is wrong, but a joint account can be very helpful, even if it's only for rent or mortgage payments. Sharing money helps couples work together to reach financial goals. It also helps build trust as both partners always have access to viewing bank account information.Are we starting in debt? Discovering that your spouse has debt that's been kept a secret is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb exploding on your marriage. Between credit cards, car payments and student debt, it's typical to have racked up some debt before purchasing a home. The key is to be completely honest with your partner about how much you owe and what the payment terms are. Credit is another issue to get out in the open. If one person has a poor credit score, for example, you may want to consider keeping certain things separate because mixing good and bad credit could end up adversely affecting your future joint borrowing opportunities.What are our financial goals? Do you want to vacation every summer? Buy a house within three years? Start a family within five? These are excellent goals to have, but also require some financial planning. Warren Buffet said it best: ""Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving."" This statement is especially apt for newly married couples. No matter your income, you should set a detailed budget and savings plan and follow it monthly. If you don't currently have an easy way to manage your money, check out services like Quicken or Mint.com to help get organized.Who will manage the budget? This may seem simple, but it can become a very tricky issue. Managing a budget is a team effort, but it does take time. If one partner is more organized or has more time to keep tabs on the finances, he or she should take charge. Monthly discussions on spending habits, investments and upcoming expenses are also important.Should we get a prenup? The prenuptial agreement is one of the most dreaded topics engaged couples talk about before their wedding. While I've always felt slimy discussing them because the nature of the agreement implies that the marriage may not last, any lawyer will tell you that it's always in your best interest to protect yourself. A few valid reasons to consider a prenup are if one partner is bringing major debt into the relationship, if there's business ownership involved or if one partner brings a significant amount of wealth into the marriage. The decision is ultimately yours, and shouldn't be taken lightly.It's important to have some of these tough conversations well in advance of your wedding day. Remember, honesty is always the best policy and marital finances are always a team effort. If you and your future spouse decide you need some help tackling these issues, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling is a great place to start."

4,MONEY,5 Surprising Reasons Why Car Insurance Rates Rise,"Laura Adams, Contributor
Personal finance expert and award-winning author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-surprising-reasons-why_us_5b9deb7ce4b03a1dcc8ec214,"Even if you don't get a traffic ticket, cause a car accident, or have a teenage boy in the household, you could end up paying more for insurance for these five lesser-known reasons.",2014-03-10,2014-03-10-reasons_why_car_insurance_rates_rise.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-03-10-reasons_why_car_insurance_rates_rise-thumb.jpg,"If life were completely predictable or safe, the insurance industry probably wouldn't exist. But you never know what's around the corner, especially when you're actually driving a car. That's why a minimum amount of car insurance is required in every state.I don't know about you, but there are many ways I'd rather spend money than on a lackluster car insurance policy. You can't eat it, wear it, surf the web on it, or sleep under it -- although having it can certainly help you worry less and sleep better at night. Since no one wants to overpay, you should know some surprising reasons why your car insurance rates could climb. Even if you don't get a traffic ticket, cause a car accident, or have a teenage boy in the household, you could end up paying more for insurance for these five lesser-known reasons.Lisa S. / Shutterstock.comReason #1: Insurers change rates frequently Insurers attempt to forecast how expensive future claims will be, but they can't predict the future. For instance, they analyze the number of claims and payouts made due to events such as natural disasters, crime, and crashes in your neighborhood. If the rate of car claims goes up, you might see a spike in your rate -- even if you've been the world's safest driver. And if claims drop or get less expensive for your insurer, they might lower your rate when your policy renews. Wouldn't that be nice?An insurance company might also increase rates to offset economic conditions such as inflation or lower than expected investment returns. Additionally, carriers may boost rates when they need to juice profits or maintain higher cash reserves.To see real-time data about what's happening with car insurance rates where you live, use the Rate Trend Tool at insuranceQuotes.com, a leading insurance data aggregator owned by Bankrate.com. Reason #2: You relocateInsurance is regulated almost exclusively by individual state governments. Each has its own set of laws that insurers must follow in order to write policies for its residents. Your state's department of insurance may approve a new rate plan for all drivers. It could pass a regulation that excludes insurers from using certain types of consumer information when setting rates. Or it could raise the state's minimum insurance requirements. Even if you relocate in-state, you might move to an area with higher accident risk or more crime, which could cause your rate to skyrocket. For instance, a 2013 study of California car insurance premiums found that rates for Los Angeles residents could vary by as much as 33 percent as a result of moving to a different ZIP code within the same city.Reason #3: Your credit report changesMost consumers don't realize that credit affects much more than whether you can get approved for a jumbo mortgage. The majority of carriers in most states use data from your credit reports to set home and car insurance rates.Having negative information in your credit history -- like late payments, having an account in collections, maxing out a credit card, or taking on too much debt -- may cost you. A 2013 study on how credit affects car insurance premiums found that drivers with poor credit pay as much as 91 percent more than those with excellent credit. Even having a middle-of-the-road credit score means you'll pay up to 24 percent more.However, not all carriers use your credit information the same way. To learn more, read Credit and Your Insurance Score: What Every Consumer Should Know (a PDF download). The bottom line is that if you're having financial trouble that shows up on your credit reports, it can cause your insurance rates to rise at a time when you can least afford it.Reason #4: You buy a new carWhen it's time to buy a new car, don't forget that the make and model you select affects how much you have to pay for insurance. A racy sports car costs more to insure than a kid-hauling minivan. Not only does it attract a different type of driver, but it's typically more expensive to repair or replace.Your rate could go up if your new ride is a fan favorite among car thieves. Some of the most-stolen cars include mid-90s Honda Accords, Honda Civics, and Toyota Camrys. Why? Their parts are in high demand. Choosing a car that doesn't ace safety tests could also cause you to pay more for insurance. Safety technology such as side air bags, rear-view cameras, and crash-resistant designs can earn you money-saving discounts. Reason #5: You lose a discountAnd speaking of discounts, your car insurance rate could go up if you lose a discount that you didn't even know about or that no longer applies, such as:  â€¢ Bundling car insurance with other coverage, such as home â€¢ Insuring more than one vehicle with a carriers â€¢ Not having a lapse in coverage â€¢ Paying your policy in full, instead of in installments â€¢ Being claims-free â€¢ Having a clean driving record â€¢ Receiving a promotional discount for switching carriers â€¢ Driving low annual milesThe good news is that since car insurance rates aren't fixed from carrier to carrier or even from month to month, you can always shop around for a better rate. It's easy to get free quotes online using an insurance aggregator such as NetQuote.com or insuranceQuotes.com. In fact, if you're not shopping car insurance at least once a year, you're probably leaving money on the table.Laura Adams is a personal finance expert, award-winning author, and senior insurance analyst for Bankrate Insurance.

5,STYLE & BEAUTY,How Coloring My Hair Changed Me As a Person,"Sarah Rose Attman, Contributor
Founder of Sarah Rose Public Relations",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/i-changed-my-hair-and-it_us_5b9deaf5e4b03a1dcc8eb30f,"With distance from the girl I used to be, I had space to figure out who I really was and what I really wanted -- and I wanted to be blonde.",2014-03-10,2014-03-08-483612_10151202913838682_70239713_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-03-08-483612_10151202913838682_70239713_n-thumb.jpg,"If you knew me 10 years ago, you would not recognize me today. For most of my life I had long dark brown hair but over the past few years it has been blonde, blue, ombre, and black.  I didn't used to be this adventurous. Growing up, I always wanted to be blonde but when I shared my desire with others I was met with total disapproval. ""NO! Don't do it. It would look terrible on you!"" Or, ""I could NEVER see you as a blonde,"" which was fair because I have olive skin and dark eyebrows.  Hairdressers shared more reasons why I shouldn't do it: being blonde is a lot of upkeep. The color would damage my hair. It would take hours and several appointments to achieve the color I wanted. If I wanted a change, why not go darker instead? That would look better and really bring out my eyes.  It seemed the whole world was against me being blonde, so I gave in and stayed a natural brunette. Every time that little voice inside me whispered ""But I want to be blonde!"" I would tell it to go away -- this was the best I was going to look so I needed to stay this way.  Fast forward and at age 24 I found myself sitting in the hairdresser's chair, ready to make a drastic change.  There were many factors that contributed to this change of heart. I had been through a lot (heart ache, graduating school, living in a new city) and did some self-exploration. With distance from the girl I used to be, I had space to figure out who I really was and what I really wanted -- and I wanted to be blonde.  Sherri Belanger, my longtime hairdresser, played with my hair as we looked at my reflection in the mirror.  ""I can tell,"" she said. ""You're ready.""  I was. I was ready to risk the tears and self-loathing that comes with a bad haircut, not to mention an entirely new look. I had no clue what I'd look like blonde but I was ready to trust the little voice inside me and finally go for it, even if it made no sense to anyone else.  (Side note: I'm forever grateful to Sherri for spearheading my transformation. She truly listened to me and never tried to dissuade me from what I wanted.)  I was at the salon for 6 hours. Because I had virgin hair, it could handle a lot of chemicals. We didn't know how blonde we could get it in one sitting, but I ended up a very beautiful, light colored hue. After my hair was blown out, Sherri and I once again stared at my reflection in her mirror.  ""Wow,"" she said. I shifted my head from one side to the other, marveling at my new locks.  The next few days I kept walking past mirrors and feeling completely shocked. Who was I? My dog didn't recognize me when I picked him up from daycare. I was taking night classes and during roll call, professors did a double take. When I flew home for the holidays a few weeks later, my father couldn't find me at the airport.  Most surprisingly, this decision to go blonde opened up a floodgate inside me. I had wanted to be blonde, no one thought it was a good idea, I did it anyway (which took a lot of courage), and I liked the result. Instead of telling my heart, ""Sorry you can't have what you want,"" I was sending a new message to the body: ""You can have what you want and you can trust that little voice.""  Over the next few months, I realized other things I wanted, other things I had feared: I wanted to quit graduate school. I wanted to start a business. I wanted to move to a different part of the city. As I began pursuing these dreams, in spite of my fears, I felt lighter, happier, more empowered, and free.  Now, years later, I am back to brunette, but it's a different type of brunette: shoulder length and almost black-colored. I've had many different hair colors and people have started telling me, ""You change your hair every time I see you!""  If I wake up tomorrow and want to be blonde again, I'll go to the salon and make the change. The nice thing about hair is that it grows back and if you don't like it you can fix it. But because of this experience, there is a new fearlessness inside of me, an energy which has spilled over into all areas of my life."

The landmark, one of the country's finest examples of Beaux Arts architecture and the most famous train station in America is celebrating it's 100th anniversary on February 1. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9deaf1250000320036a47b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear Kind Gentleman I Met in Grand Central Station on January 15, 2014 at 8:56 a.m.,I was definitely in a rush when I got to Grand Central at 8:56 in the morning. An hour and fifteen minutes before, I had boarded the D train in Brooklyn, then transferred to the Manhattan-bound express train at Atlantic Avenue. I finally alighted underneath Grand Central with just five minutes to spare.I had just decided to start heading to the information counter in the middle of the concourse when a kind gentleman asked me if I could use some assistance. I don't know if you've ever imagined walking with a white cane through the middle of Grand Central station, but as you can guess, it is a little tricky.So I said: ""Absolutely, that would be wonderful.""He proffered his elbow and I took hold. As we made our way to my train, this gentleman asked me if I had been blind all my life. Now, the question itself is not a novel one, but I was pleasantly surprised by the directness (most people perform feats of verbal acrobatics to avoid even mentioning anything that they think would be upsetting to me).""I lost most of my vision at the age of 10. Why do you ask?""He explained that his 4-year-old son was born with a condition identical to my own.""That's what I have!"" I said to him with a little too much excitement in my voice. It's like when you meet someone who broke their leg in the same place you did. It's not that you're happy that they broke their leg; it's just nice to find someone who can commiserate with you.""That's what I was afraid of,"" he said. Realizing his thought process, I shook my head. ""No, no, it wasn't the condition that caused most of my vision loss. In fact, everything was pretty stable beforehand. There was just a freak accident.""He and I both knew the degenerative nature of his son's eye condition, so I couldn't lie to him, but I did try my best to comfort him by saying: ""I'm sure that if he receives the right medical treatment, your son has many years of perfectly useable vision ahead of him.""By this point, we were at my train. For some reason, I didn't think to give him my card. It just didn't feel like the right moment to introduce myself as a singer/songwriter and ask him to go and buy my songs on iTunes. All I could think to do was shake his hand and say with as much sincerity as I could muster: ""Your son will be OK. Everything is going to be fine."" He thanked me and I boarded the train. As the train pulled away, my mind began to overflow with everything I wish I could have told him. I'm sure my parents wished someone had told them about what it would be like to have a child who is a little different from what they planned on. So, to the gentleman from Grand Central, and to any other parent who should find this helpful, here are a few things I've learned in my life that may help you put things in perspective:1. Give your child reservoirs of confidence and self-esteem. As a child, long before I realized I was ""different,"" I would have been shocked if you told me that in fact I was not the center of the universe. I would have been shocked to discover the sun and moon did not rise and fall directly behind me, and the stars did not twinkle for me alone. Such was the amount of love and affection that my family bestowed upon me. The theory is this: The world will have the rest of your child's life to chip away at his or her confidence and self-esteem. So while you have them all to yourself, why not give your children the gift of an endless supply of both? Now, don't confuse this with a child that grows into an arrogant/entitled adult. Arrogance is masked insecurity; what I am referring to is a genuine sense of self-worth that will never fail your child. I can't emphasize enough how important this was for me throughout adolescence, when insecurity seems to be a plague that everyone catches. 2. Show tough love. My uncle used to say to me, ""Blessing, you're blind. You may have to work twice as hard to get where everybody else is, and three times as hard to surpass them, so always work four times as hard."" It's inevitable that your child will start asking questions. ""Why me? How is this fair?"" These are perfectly normal questions. Don't avoid them, and don't sugar-coat them. Sometimes things are hard. Sometimes things aren't fair. But life is hard and it's definitely not fair for everyone. And it will be OK if your child has to work four times harder than any other child. Embrace the challenge. For me, the deeper explanation came from church. My faith explained a lot to me and brought me a lot of peace. I will leave it up to you as the parent how to handle that aspect. But I can tell you, should your child start asking these questions early, they will need bigger answers than just the practical. And if they start asking these questions early, you're going to have a very mature, individuated adult trapped in the body of a young person. Encourage the maturity, but don't let your child forget how old he or she actually is. I've always felt older than my years, precisely because I had to ask these questions so early. A firm sense of identity is one of the most important things that you could ever encourage your child to cultivate. You don't want them to be blown off course by every gust of wind or change of current. 3. Open the cocoon. It's only natural for you to want to protect your child from every little thing. Those are good instincts at first, but can become more detrimental if not carefully managed. In middle school when I wanted to walk to school myself, my family freaked out a little. I was 13 years old, brimming with teenage bravado and ready to take on the world, so why shouldn't I walk to school? This was a new paradigm that my family had to adjust to. I wasn't going to be a stay-at-home blind person, like perhaps they thought they would be more comfortable with. In fact, they wouldn't have been satisfied with that at all. I think they like me much more as I am: living in New York City, totally independent, able to handle any circumstance... you know, an adult. As scary as it is, if you want your child to become an adult, you're going to have to let him or her learn to cross streets, get lost and fight giants on his or her own. Please don't alter your expectations for this child. Instead, you may have to find different ways to achieve them. I do know that my uncle trailed quietly behind me those first few times that I walked to school. Eventually, he realized that it just wasn't necessary and after a while I began to take the bus because I didn't want to get up early and walk. I had proved my point and that's all that mattered. 4. Own yourself This is more for the kids, rather than the parents. A million people will tell you a million different things; everyone has an opinion, and that's OK. At the end of the day, the most important message is the one you give to yourself. I encourage you to embrace, accept and celebrate whatever mountain you have to daily turn into a molehill, because it will be a daily process. Some days will have you asking, ""why me?"" louder than ever, while other days will have you happier than you know what to do with because you will see your friends struggling with questions that you already asked yourself years ago. Everybody is going through the same thing in his or her own way. ""Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle,"" said Plato.The older I get, the more I find this to be true. Avoid bitterness. Let go of the things that people say or do out of ignorance. You would probably do the same thing if you didn't know better. And for the days that your molehill does look more like a mountain, climb that mountain with as much style and grace as you can muster. Make people jealous of your mountain; make them wish they could be on your mountain with you. And before you know it, it will be a molehill again. And then one day, you might find yourself in Grand Central station rushing for a train with minutes to spare, and a really nice guy will ask if he can help you, and he will feel comfortable enough to share with you that his child has what you have. And you will be able to reassure him from a deep reservoir of confidence and self-esteem that everything will in fact be OK. And then you will be kicking yourself for not remembering that you are a singer/songwriter with business cards! So to the gentleman from Grand Central, if you happen to be reading this, please email me at: blessingoffor@gmail.com. It would have been worth missing that train if I could have just stayed to talk with you for a few more minutes!"
7,TRAVEL,7 Ways to Give Back While You Travel,"Adam Pervez, Contributor

Adventures and experiences of a lifetime are ripe for the picking on all seven continents. Having just completed my own 2.5 year adventure across five of those continents, people often ask me how they can give back while they travel -- how can they can give a bit to the communities they visit along the way? Here are some suggestions.1. Microloans There are countless organizations where you can contribute a relatively small amount of money by Western standards and change someone else's life immeasurably. Microloans help entrepreneurs in developing countries start or expand small businesses. Organizations like Kiva allow you to lend to people they profile around the world. Another organization called Investours, presently in Mexico and Tanzania, allows you to take tours of impoverished areas and meet local entrepreneurs who have transformed their lives thanks to microloans. The minimum fee for a tour is their minimum loan offered to an entrepreneur. One hundred percent of every tour's earnings goes toward microloans for the communities you visit on the tour.At The School Of St. Jude. Photo courtesy of Adam Pervez2. Travel Differently Some organizations allow you to travel differently so that the very act of you traveling makes a difference. An organization called Epic Road offers luxury safaris to Africa and Antarctica that leave a positive impact on where you visit. For example, while on your safari in the Serengeti you can go with a team and implant a microchip in an endangered black rhinoceros. You actively take part in wildlife conservation while enabling anti-poaching efforts, allowing the animal and its horn to be tracked in case poachers attack. Epic Road also facilitates the adoption of baby elephants whose mothers have fallen victim to poaching. You can bottle feed a baby elephant while your financial contribution ensures it grows into a strong adult. With Epic Road I paid a visit to The School of St Jude, a school providing a fantastic education to the poorest of the poor in Tanzania. There, I donated soccer balls to the students and had a wonderful discussion about culture and life. Similarly, India's Reality Tours offers tours in places like the infamous Dharavi Slum of Bombay. Eighty percent of their profits are reinvested in the communities they work in, promoting community growth and sustainable tourism.3. VolunteerThe opportunities here are too numerous to mention. Many organizations offer long-term and short-term opportunities. Some organizations let you volunteer for free, getting their funding from outside sources. Others fund their operations by charging volunteers a fee (yet often providing food and lodging as well). Some organizations are more impactful than others. Do your homework.4. Support Local Businesses Depending where you're going, you can have a far greater impact by simply deciding where to shop. Shop or eat at a multinational chain and your impact is much less than shopping and eating at small, family-run stores and restaurants.5. Support Social Businesses In many well-traveled areas of the world, you find tourists who turned into social entrepreneurs with a mission to improve the lives of the local people. They are often businesses like hotels or restaurants that on their own are excellent, but beneath the surface give all their proceeds to a social mission. One such example is a cafe in Siem Reap, Cambodia (home of Angkor Wat) called Common Grounds. On the surface they serve coffee and sandwiches. Beneath the surface they are supporting a local children's home that also provides vocational training to locals.6. Use Public Transportation For those seeking to minimize their impact on the environment, use public transportation in cities and buses or trains to reach new destinations. Bring a water bottle with you and fill it with clean water wherever possible to avoid buying bottled water. You can also buy carbon offsets to mitigate your environmental impact for the miles you will travel. You will also get to walk a mile in local shoes, which often leads to incredible experiences.7. Be An Ambassador Having visited the incredible people of Iraq and Somalia in the past few months, learning so much about their cultures and sharing so much of my own, I realized that one of the most important parts of traveling is being an ambassador. Having the privilege to travel means you automatically become an honorary ambassador between your country and the place you visit. Likewise, when you return, you are an honorary ambassador of the place you visited to your home country. Serving in this capacity you can educate both sides, making the world a smaller, more peaceful place."
