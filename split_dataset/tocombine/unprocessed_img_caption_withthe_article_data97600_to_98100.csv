Or, as it has seemed over the last few decades, maybe they collect me. This is not just a glib bullshit Snappy Opener. I'll explain...First, if for absolutely no other reason than to provide the formidable Deke Dickerson, author of The Strat in the Attic 1 & 2, with bona fides that validate me as worthy of discussing his books in a public forum, I list some of the highlights of my own guitar collection... in alphabetical/chronological order by make/build date...Danelectro September 1966 GuitarlinEpiphone March 1961 Casino Epiphone August 1961 Sheraton Epiphone October 1962 Coronet (Dwight logo on headstock)Fender November 1957 Stratocaster Fender April 1964 Duo-Sonic Fender October 1966 TelecasterFramus 1962 Star BassGibson February 1959 'sunburst' Les Paul Standard Gibson March 1964 Hummingbird Gibson January 1965 Firebird III Gibson January 1969 SG Special Gibson January 1969 Les Paul CustomGretsch October 1956 Chet Atkins 6120Harmony 1957 Catalina Harmony 1965 MeteorRickenbacker April 1965 Rose-Morris 1998 Rickenbacker September 1966 330-12Vox 1967 BobcatOkay, that's quite enough of that. Jeeez! Braggart! Well, okay, yes, there's that.My 'they collect me' line up there refers to my own extraordinary luck and timing over the years when it comes to fabulous guitars just strolling up to me, jumping in my lap, and cooing, ""You can afford me.""In Deke Dickerson's two books, The Strat in the Attic 1 & 2, published by the smartypantses at Voyageur Press, (2 has just been released) there is almost none of that. Deke's got two categories of collectors... There are the ""canned"" hunters who browse websites with their credit card at the ready. They see a 1958 Fender Stratocaster (the ""Strat"" in Deke's title) on a vintage guitar website, they put it in their shopping cart. Voila! You bad. You own a '58, dude. Ummmm, do you know how to play it?Then, there's the serious ""Thrill of the Hunt"" guys... While the trees have been pretty much picked clean, you can still find those two or three fellas will still get in a car and drive over 1,000 miles in a weekend, going from small town to small town and stopping in every music store, thrift shop, antique boutique, yard sales, scouring for rare guitars being sold by folks who don't know. Deke's books abound with stories of the unlikeliest of guitars showing up in the unlikeliest of places. A great example from Attic 1... A fellow obsessive finds Deke the only known Gibson Futura, a guitar that never made it past the prototype phase, sitting in the rear window deck as a piece of decoration, it's finished literally burned off by 30+ years in the naked sun, in a small town in Louisiana. WTF?Before the internet, this was how you did it. You roamed and sought out. Or in my New York City Lazy Boy case, just stop into the same three or four shops 4 or 5 times a week every week. With exactly one exception, the guitar I'm gonna discuss below, all my acquisitions have been face-to-face encounters, either in a shop, or someone mentioning a guitar they were thinking of selling and me following up. In a few cases, my 1959 Les Paul and my 1957 Strat, the two true jewels in my collection, as examples, I went looking for the guitar with pure zealot determination. But, I also own guitars that you (or I) simply would never dream of actually Hunting Down. As in, never even bother to fantasize about. Two examples...My little 'budget-guitar', the Dwight is one of maybe 60 made at the end of 1962. A botched promotion between Epiphone Musical Instruments and a music store in St. Louis, they were a flop. Probably 75% of them have been destroyed or mutilated. Beginner's models are next to impossible to find in good shape (my 100% original Dwight... a scorcher of an ax, too... is about an 8.4 on a 10 scale, if 10 is minty new).My 1965 Rickenbacker Rose-Morris 1998 (that was the 'futuristic' model number) is the exact 'export-only' model Pete Townshend used for the entire debut album by The Who. It is the model he's windmilling on that famous black'n'white ""Maximum R&B"" poster. Rickenbacker made less than 400 and all of them were shipped to the U.K. and Europe. Finding one at Matt Brewster's wonderful 30th Street Guitars in New York ten years ago was not a dream come true. I'd never even bothered. As I've stated, it's almost always about timing. Five of my guitars had been on the floor of Matt's shop for less than 20 minutes. In every case, I was pretty much the first person to see the dang thing. Timing! These kinds of instruments never turn up on 'canned surf-aries' on the web. But, man, this Deke Dickerson... This guy is of an altogether 'nother breed... He coined the term for his particular case of severe OCD... ""Guitarchaeology"".This man will track a guitar for literal years. He will fly to small towns on the basis of a rumor. He will pore over sales records from guitar manufacturers and retailers from decades ago, looking for a scrap of a clue, he will wait years for an owner to finally give in and sell.Okay, here's who Deke Dickerson is, encapsulated in just one of his dozens of amazing and throughly entertaining stories...If you look at my list above, the very first guitar listed, the Danelectro Guitarlin (so named because it had 31 frets instead of the usual 20 -22, like a mandolin, get it), turns out to be very rare indeed, as I just learned from reading The Strat in the Attic. It was a special order high-end item (made by a low-end company) that was created in very small batches between 1958 and 1968. When I was a tyke of 12 or so I saw a few bands, including The Who, use these weird guitars on shows like Shindig and was eternally hooked. I had to have one. Over the many years, I looked in every store I came across and often asked if they'd seen one (as in, back in the stockroom). The answer was always no. Always. It was over 35 years of just keeping the old eye out that led me to my 100% original 1966 Guitarlin, purchased off of eBay in 2005.One of the most famous pioneer-purveyors of raw hoodlum distorted rock guitar was Dano Guitarlin user, Link Wray (shame on you if you're wondering ""Who?"" Google now! We'll wait... ). His ""Rumble"" instrumental was so exciting and even menacing that it was actually banned by some radio stations when it came out in 1958. Promoted juvenile delinquency, doncha know! Link recorded, performed, and posed with his 1958 Danelectro Guitarlin. Lots of photos exist of Link and his 'Lin. As you guitar-peeps already know, this Danelectro is actually sort of a mere sideshow curio-oddball in my batch 'o boys, especially compared to the Mighty Gibsons and Fenders. So, why do I highlight it here?Well, it amply illustrates Deke Dickerson's obsession(s) as compared to a piker like me. I merely hankered after this particular model and kinda waited for one to cross my path. Deke was never interested in owning a goofy Danelectro Guitarlin. No way! Screw that! No, Deke was intent on, and succeeded in, finding and acquiring Link Wray's Guitarlin, okay.Link's. The one in all the pictures. The one you hear on most of Mr. Wray's recorded works of the late 1950s and early 1960s.Only took Deke years.  Another quick history lesson with the utterly-typical Deke Dickerson punchline... Wait for it...In the mid-1940s, California was infested with superbly talented musicians playing what was/is called Western Swing... Jokey shorthand description... Cowboy gittars throw in a huge dollop of Count Basie into what you might call typical Country songs. Yes, there was twang and fiddles and bangos and odd and ends but, this music was created and performed by a group of men to whom the appellation 'virtuoso' seems anemic. The guitar players up and down the length of California in the 1940s were simply astonishing on any level, whether in raw freakish skill or wildly inventive writing.Leading up to WWII, the guitar, more than any other instrument, seemed to go through a very powerful, if erratic, ascendency in popular music. Hard to believe now, but, bringing electricity to a guitar was born out of a brief but pervasive fad of that ultra-syrupy Hawaiian music with the slippery whining 'lap steel' guitars in the 1930s. Really just glorified planks with strings set an inch or so above it, to be played by applying pressure to the string with a steel bar and sliding to and from notes. Country music appropriated the sound and slicked it way the hell up with the pedal steel guitars any casual Country fan is thoroughly versed in.By the end of the war, with tech-creativity booming, the idea of a fully electric solid-body (for purer tone and less noise) guitar was inevitable. A machinist, Paul Bigsby, who was also a player, knew many of the hotshot Western Swing guys in the region. In 1948, Paul decided to build solid body electric guitar for his friend Merle Travis and to show his various musician pals. Bigsby's guitar was phenomenal. Incredibly easy to play and with superbly rich tone and a fantastic primitive look that belies the exquisite craft. He also showed it to two local Cali pallies, Leo Fender (yes, that Fender) and Ted McCarty (founder of Gibson Guitars' electric division). Uhhh, yeah.Paul Bigsby wound up making only 21 guitars. To call these rare is demeaning. Not only are there so very few, but, every one is accounted for and never for sale... except... that by the end of The Strat in the Attic 1, our intrepid guide, Deke D has bagged THREE of them. Yes, the man who wrote these two books, sharing his, and his fellow psychos' stories, owns three of twenty-one Bigsby guitars. You know that first-ever issue of Superman or that Upside Down Airplane stamp? It's like Deke owns three of each of those, okay.So, are you ready for a book of Guitar Stories brought to you by someone that single-mindedly focused and, well, magically freakin' cool? Let me tell you, Deke has dug up, not just great stories, but, real-life characters a screenplay writer would discount as too good to be true. Every pioneer of electric guitars, almost to a man, was an eccentric... with the exceptions of Leo and Ted... perhaps a reason the names Fender and Gibson trip off our tongues and Mosrite, Del Vecchio, Microfret do not?One of the strongest flavors to just drench every page of these two super-entertaining books is...USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA... It's not jingoism... it really was a bunch of rough 'n' ready American fellers, most ex-GIs, at the beginning of the 1950s who created what we have called electric guitars for decades in their garages, dens, at their die-tool job after hours... Almost all of them just grabbing the problems presented by electrifying a stringed instrument by the neck (pun) and coming up with some amazingly clever solutions, along with the truly wacky ideas that always pop up in endeavors like this. Deke is as interested, or perhaps, even more interested, in the weirdos and one-offs from these early developmental years. Yes, there are very cool stories about Les Pauls and Telecasters and White Falcons, but, frankly, and to my own surprise, I found the tales about guys like Harvey Thomas (making fiberglass triple-neck guitars in the 1960s) or David Bunker's insane 12 pick up gold-sparkle naugahyde creation for Johnny Paycheck more fun and informative than any of the stories about someone finding a ""big gun"" like a 1950's Gibson Les Paul or 1940s Martin acoustic. Yes, it's cool to read about guitars worth six-figure sums, but, Deke gives you so much more than just the aforementioned 'the thrill of the hunt'. With a wonderfully breezy writing style, Mr. Dickerson imparts newly uncovered history of one of the single most influential and culturally important items Mankind has ever devised... The Electric Guitar."

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., appears at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in Rayburn Building titled 'International Wildlife Trafficking Threats to Conservation and National Security.' (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e7ca25000094003a5936.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""As far I'm concerned, every last one of them can rot in hell. But as long as they don't do that, they can rot in Guantanamo Bay,"" concluded Senator Tom Cotton in a combative line of questioning yesterday at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Guantanamo. Other than his reflexive hatred of my clients, the Arkansas Senator's remark made something else abundantly clear -- he has never met any of them. If he had met Tariq Ba Odah, for example, Mr. Cotton would know there is little difference between hell and Tariq's isolation cell at Guantanamo's Camp 5. Tariq arrived at Guantanamo in 2002 when Mr. Cotton was a 25-year-old law student. While Mr. Cotton was an associate at prestigious law firms, while he was a management-consultant, during his tenure in the House, and as he won election to the Senate, Tariq has been, as Mr. Cotton put it so well, ""rotting"" at Guantanamo. As of this month, Tariq has been on a hunger strike for eight years. Guantanamo prison staff force-feeds him every day. Tariq also goes on ""no wash"" protests, refusing to leave his cell, shower, or cut his nails for months in order to manifest the horror he is living.Tariq protests in this manner precisely because Guantanamo is hell. At the island prison, he is subjected to solitary confinement, daily tube feedings through his nose, and violent cell extractions, all without ever having been charged with a crime, tried, or allowed the mercy of knowing the length of his sentence. Tariq has survived 13 years at Guantanamo. Whether he must survive another 13 weeks, months or years -- an eternity under his present circumstances -- no one knows. Whether his cell one day becomes his coffin, as Mr. Cotton's would prefer, is anyone's guess. The anguish this uncertainty produces is hellish indeed. It is also entirely unwarranted.Between 2009 and 2010, six agencies -- the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, State, and Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- undertook a meticulous review of Tariq's record and declared by unanimous consent that he can be released from Guantanamo. Most Guantanamo prisoners, including another of my clients, Fahd Ghazy, who was imprisoned at the age of 17, were cleared in the same way. Others, like my colleague's client, Ghaleb al-Bihani, were cleared after an equally rigorous review performed by the government's Periodic Review Boards. For someone so concerned with the safety of this country, Mr. Cotton's mistrust of the judgment of every prominent national security and intelligence agency in the U.S. government is peculiar. What could the freshman senator possibly know that they do not?Not a thing. When it comes to Tariq, Fahd, Ghaleb, or any individual actually imprisoned at Guantanamo, the answer is nothing. But that matters little to Mr. Cotton. Trafficking in tired myths about Guantanamo has always been smart politics. Today, Senators Ayotte, McCain, and others are seizing on the recent tragedy in Paris and ISIL's blood-thirst as a new justification for an old plan to undercut the administration, halt long overdue prisoner releases, and keep Guantanamo open indefinitely. That plan is too costly to go unchecked by President Obama, whether it is measured in dollars and cents, damage to U.S. reputation, or the risk perceived by so many in his national security establishment that Guantanamo is a propaganda windfall that motivates, rather than prevents, terrorism. In any event, the cost in human suffering is incalculable, and that is undoubtedly the measure by which history will judge the president if he fails, yet again, to make good on his promise to shutter the prison. Senator Cotton may prefer hell to Guantanamo for my clients, but what does he really know about either? What he knows is how to play politics -- a game where one thing is certain: the prisoners at Guantanamo always lose."

Recently, HuffPost Science asked Tyson to weigh in on the outbreak of measles that has spread across the country since December. The outbreak seems to have been fueled in part by concerns over the safety of childhood vaccines that led some parents not to vaccinate their children. The vaccines have been shown to be both safe and effective, so what's up with that? In an email to The Huffington Post, Tyson offered a simple but disturbing explanation:""Not enough of our society is trained how to understand and interpret quantitative information. This activity is a centerpiece of science literacy to which we should all strive -- the future health, wealth, and security of our democracy depend on it.

(AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e54f2200005700dd8078.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An abomination. A lawless usurpation. One of the worst decisions of all time. That sums up the conventional wisdom on the Supreme Court's decision in Lochner v. New York (1905). So it is no surprise that Senator Rand Paul created quite a stir last week when he praised Lochner at a conference hosted by Heritage Action. To hear Ian Millhiser of Think Progress tell it, Senator Paul's defense of Lochner was indefensible -- the Lochner Court ""fabricated"" a right with no basis in the Constitution and mercilessly struck down a humane law intended to shield overworked bakers from ""exploitation."" Simply put, the case against Lochner is half-baked. In striking down a nasty bit of economic protectionism, the Lochner Court vindicated rights that are constitutionally protected and of vital importance to ordinary Americans. Lochner presents a stellar example of judicial engagement that judges considering economic liberty cases today could learn a great deal from.What were the facts? As Professor David Bernstein has documented in his invaluable history, Rehabilitating Lochner, an 1895 law called the Bakeshop Act prohibited New Yorkers from working in a bakery more than ten hours in one day or 60 hours per week, and made it a criminal offense to employ a worker for more than 60 hours a week. Although presented as a public safety measure, the law was in fact the product of a zealous lobbying effort on the part of nativist unionized bakers at factory bakeries. These bakers sought to protect themselves against competition from Eastern European immigrants who lacked the capital for expensive equipment and made their bread by hand, which required them to work longer hours. (The union's newspaper referred to them as ""the green hand from foreign shores."") Joseph Lochner was convicted under the Bakeshop Act for permitting an employee to work longer than 60 hours in one week. He challenged the maximum-hours restriction, arguing that the law violated his rights and those of his workers to liberty of contract -- a liberty that the Court had held to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.In evaluating the hours law, the Lochner Court displayed all of the hallmarks of judicial engagement. It made a genuine effort to determine whether the law plausibly furthered a constitutionally legitimate end. As Justice Peckham explained:The mere assertion that the subject relates though, but in a remote degree, to the public health does not necessarily render the enactment valid. The act must have a more direct relation, as a means to an end, and the end itself must be appropriate and legitimate.Scrutinizing the record, the court found that the state had offered no proof that allowing bakers to work beyond the allotted hours posed a material danger to the bakers' or the public's health or that bakers were uniquely incapable of making decisions for themselves about what was necessary to support themselves or their families. Accordingly, it struck down the law. In a famous dissent, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes charged that the majority had written laissez-faire economic principles into the Constitution. But the Lochner Court did not invent liberty of contract. The right to buy and sell labor on mutually agreed-upon terms is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Slavery was also an economic institution, and the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to stamp out the vestiges of slavery by, among other things, ensuring that people of all races were secure in their rights to sell their own labor and make and enforce lawful contracts. Contra Holmes, the Constitution does express a principled commitment to protecting economic liberty. Today, although the courts give lip service to economic liberty, they all too often fail to protect it. Under the so-called ""rational basis test,"" the default standard of review in constitutional cases, the Supreme Court and lower courts do the opposite of what the Lochner Court did -- they make no effort to determine whether the government is in fact pursuing legitimate ends through means that plausibly further them, and indeed, sometimes even assist the government in rationalizing naked economic protectionism. The result? Regulations purportedly designed to protect the public but serving only to protect the politically powerful from competition are squelching countless American dreams. Senator Paul's challenge to the conventional wisdom on Lochner is neither unmoored from the Constitution nor hostile to the rights of workers. Lochner is deeply rooted in an American legal tradition that protects individual rights from overbearing majorities and entrenched special interests, and the decision showcases what courts can and must do to keep the political branches in check. The judicial engagement showcased by the Lochner Court is crucial to ensuring that hard-working Americans everywhere enjoy their full measure of constitutionally protected freedom. Those who value what William O. Douglas called ""the most precious liberty man possesses"" -- the right to earn an honest living -- should encourage judges to stop worrying and learn to love Lochner."

Yesterday's hearing in the Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security was the sixth hearing in four years on E-Verify -- the electronic employer verification system designed to determine who is eligible to work legally. But without a plan to legalize workers, the Legal Workforce Act proposed (again) by Republicans, is just another ineffective, half-baked bill that won't fix our immigration system. E-Verify is widely understood to be an important part of any top-to-bottom fix of our broken immigration system. Every serious comprehensive immigration reform proposal in the last decade has mandated the use of E-Verify or something like it by all employers. I know, because I worked with offices on both sides of the Hill and both sides of the aisle to write most of those bills.But E-Verify in the absence of broader reforms would destroy entire industries and weaken our economy. It would drive our current workforce -- especially our undocumented workforce -- farther underground and keep them off the books. And hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens and Legal Permanent Residents would be falsely identified as ineligible to work because of flaws in the system and its data. When approximately one in 20 workers in the U.S. economy are in the country illegally, what will happen when you mandate E-Verify tomorrow and do not fix other aspects of immigration?The Republican fantasy is that 11 million people will leave the country.The Republican fantasy is that millions of people who work in the United States will suddenly decide that their prospects for economic advancement and the survival of their children would be better served if they went back to rural Cambodia, or walked back to the mountains of Central America. But how many will take their chances in the countries they fled because of war, murder, famine, and desperation?The fantasy that millions of people will simply disappear if we just have stricter laws, the old ""self-deportation"" theory and the lynchpin of the Romney campaign in 2012, did not work as a political strategy and is laughable as a policy.Democrats -- and frankly, most Republicans and most Americans -- do not believe that E-Verify in and of itself is a magic wand that will miraculously make 11 million people and their families disappear.We believe that we need three basic ingredients to get more control over immigration, to make sure that immigration is operating within the law, not outside of it.Number one is legal immigration. We do not hear the Republicans talk much about legal immigration because it deeply divides their party and a good third of the Republican Caucus in both Houses of Congress is opposed, by and large, to legal immigration. They want fewer immigrants in the U.S., which is precisely why we are stuck in a rut and unable to move forward on any immigration reform. The solution to illegal immigration is legal immigration and Republicans have just not figured that out. With legal immigration comes control. With legal immigration comes orderliness, vetting, and visas.We do not need an unlimited amount of legal immigration, but right now we are constrained by the levels that were agreed upon by Congress sometime in the 1990s. The black market flourishes when we restrict the supply of legal immigration too much. The second component of immigration reform is enforcement, including E-Verify.If people can go through our immigration system rather than around it and we have checks on employers, such as jail time and huge fines, and muscle and money behind our enforcement and adjudication systems -- we can have an immigration system based on the rule of law.There is no reason we should have a 20th Century paper-based worker verification system in a 21st Century economy. Just as there is no reason to have 20th Century immigration quotas for a 21st Century economy.But the largest barrier seems to come from the third element of immigration reform, which is to recognize that millions of people have lived here for decades, raised children, and held jobs in this country but have no way to get legal or be fully protected by American labor laws.The Republicans want you to believe this fantasy: that the magic wand to get rid of all undocumented immigrants will work this time if we just pass the standalone E-Verify bill introduced by the Republicans several years ago. But that strategy has not worked for the past 25 or 30 years and those 11 million people are not magically disappearing. They are cornerstones of American communities like mine in Chicago. They have jobs, mortgages, car notes, careers and children, most of whom are U.S. citizens. With no way to get legal -- and no way to leave and come back legally because Congress outlawed that too -- we must offer a viable solution other than just hoping long-term immigrants in the U.S. will simply go away.Mass deportation has not worked. Even in places like South Carolina, where I traveled last week, people are not ""self-deporting."" The slowdown in the economy did not drive massive numbers out of the country, and now that the economy is steaming again, we shouldn't expel large numbers of experienced, capable working men and women. It would be hugely counterproductive. Even in the unlikely event that Republicans get their way in trying to make the Obama administration deport 600,000 DREAMers who have already come forward and passed criminal background checks -- as the DHS funding bill passed by the House and under consideration by the Senate this week does -- it will not actually give us more law and more order.Like recycled E-Verify proposals, the Republican majority is offering less law and less order and it all amounts to being a political stunt to reassure their most conservative supporters that they are standing up to the president; supporters who absurdly blame immigrants for crime and the measles outbreak and, in some cases, who still think the president is an undocumented immigrant himself.The show-hearings the Republicans are staging in the House Judiciary Committee this week and next do not make me optimistic that serious proposals to address border security and immigration reform are forthcoming. It is a shame because the American people want progress towards an immigration system that is safe, legal, orderly, and one that is worthy of their pride.Rep. Gutiérrez of Illinois is a Member of the Judiciary Committee and the Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security and is the Co-Chair of the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus."

Lasher's pre-audition interview with Ryan Seacrest revealed that he is the nephew of guitar legend Carlos Santana, but his famous uncle was just the beginning of what would be a rather strange and wonderful audition.The next three minutes were a whirlwind of oddities that culminated in Adam performing his original song 'These Shoes' and a golden ticket to the American Idol Hollywood round.Adam wore a bright blue headband that appeared to be more functional than style oriented. His face and dark beard instantly reminded Jennifer Lopez of Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon -- her comments must have made it back to New York because the next day Fallon was dressing up like Lasher on his show.After the Jimmy Fallon frivolity came to an end Keith Urban asked, thinking it was Lasher's phone, about a small case clipped to his guitar strap. It wasn't a phone in the case, rather Adam has type 1 diabetes and was wearing his Dexcom continuous glucose monitor (CGM) so that he could watch his blood sugar level.When the time came for Adam to play, the judges finally realized that the thumb on his playing hand was broken and wrapped in what Harry Connick Jr. called, ""a raggedy-ass lookin' cast"" but none of that mattered because soon, despite his broken thumb, tossed hair, type 1 diabetes and an only so-so Fallon impression, Adam Lasher's music is revealed to be as soulful as it gets, and he earns a ticket to Hollywood Week.

""They, as you can see, are red; they are hurting me. I want the government to help me get back on my feet.""Ebola, which has killed almost 9,000 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, initially causes fever and vomiting, then attacks the immune system and vital organs, often causing internal and external bleeding.About 60 percent of Ebola patients have died in the current outbreak, typically from shock or organ failure.Some of those who have survived the disease report a mixture of symptoms after their recovery, including vision problems, joint pain, hair and memory loss and anxiety attacks.Margaret Nanyonga, a doctor who treated Ebola patients in the town of Kenema in Sierra Leone, said she had seen survivors go blind. Overall about half of those she saw recover reported declining health, she said.Doctors say it is not yet clear how long the symptoms last. There is also no scientific literature or medical consensus on any new syndrome among West African survivors or how many people might be affected.Dan Kelly, founder of the non-profit organization Wellbody Alliance and a doctor specializing in infectious diseases, says the situation can be complicated by poor medical records making it hard to separate any new symptoms from pre-existing conditions. Ebola, like many severe infections, may also weaken survivors and make other illnesses more likely.Kelly said some Ebola after-effects appear linked to the infection itself, with some patients developing symptoms similar to so-called autoimmune disorders - where the immune system is overstimulated and begins to attack the body's own tissues. Other patients develop symptoms similar to uveitis, he said, an eye inflammation causing blindness.""With post-Ebola syndrome there is an autoimmune response: it's revved up, and we don't really know why,"" he told Reuters by telephone from Sierra Leone where he is helping with the Ebola response. NEGLECTWhen Korlia Bonarwolo left an Ebola treatment center in Monrovia last year, his blood was free of the virus but he had caught two other life-threatening diseases: malaria and pneumonia.The 26-year old doctor's assistant blames his health problems on poor care, rather than complications related to Ebola infection.At the John F. Kennedy medical center in Monrovia, drafts from the open-air corridors left him exposed, he says, while frightened nurses threw him juice boxes which he was often too weak to retrieve.Back home, medical colleagues shunned him and he had to insert his own intravenous drip. Six months afterwards he has fully recovered but, as president of a survivors' association, wants to ensure others get better support and health information.""The questions survivors are asking about where they are going to be health-wise in the future deserve answers,"" Bonarwolo said at a survivors' meeting organized by the United Nations.The outbreak is now ebbing, and the health ministry says there are fewer than 10 cases in the country, but even survivors with no worrying symptoms say it is hard to get back to normal life with so many unanswered questions about Ebola's impact.One of the ongoing concerns relates to sexual health. Some female Ebola survivors say they have stopped menstruating. The virus can also remain in semen for months.The links between Ebola and mental health disorders is also little understood. A friend of Bonarwolo's survived Ebola only to develop a mental illness afterwards. RESEARCH WINDOWBen Neumann, a virologist at Britain's Reading University who studies Ebola and other viruses and their effects, notes that Lassa virus, which comes from West Africa and causes a similar disease to Ebola, has also been reported as having longer-term health effects.""(Lassa) survivors often report signs of nerve damage such as loss of hearing,"" he told Reuters, adding that it would be ""surprising that something as damaging as Ebola did not have lasting effects.""The current lack of knowledge about post-Ebola health effects is probably ""due to Ebola being a rare virus that left few survivors before this outbreak,"" he said.Some after-effects of Ebola have been reported in previous outbreaks since the disease was first detected in 1976, but past epidemics were smaller and often more deadly, meaning there were fewer survivors to generate interest to warrant research.So this outbreak creates a unique opportunity to learn more.Kelly agrees, and wants swift follow-up.""We are at risk of missing the window,"" he said. ""We need to start catching survivors as they leave treatment centers."" (Additional reporting by Kate Kelland in London; Editing by Pravin Char)"

In my own country, Ireland, there was a great deal of resistance to change, to putting in all the correct, necessary prevention measures and treating survivors in the right way,"" she said by telephone.""You must pre-empt that. If the commission wants cooperation ... then I think a letter from the Holy Father indicating that they (bishops) should cooperate certainly lends the backing necessary to our work,"" she said.Part of the task of the commission, which is made up of 17 clerics and lay people from around the world, is to help dioceses put in place ""best practices"" to prevent abuse and work with victims in a process of healing. Eight members are women and two were sexually abused by clergy. The other victim is Peter Saunders of Britain.The worldwide scandal, which came to global prominence in Boston in 2001, has seen known abusers shunted from parish to parish instead of being defrocked and handed over to authorities.In a number of developed countries, particularly in the United States, the Catholic Church has paid tens of millions of dollars in settlements.It has put in place new measures in recent years to protect children, but victims' groups say it must do more, and make bishops who allegedly covered up the abuse accountable.

From the rock bottom to highfalutin, Middlebrow is your accessible guidebook to the world of entertainment. Sign up to receive it in your inbox here.Taylor Swift, pop star and nice person who once gave a girl $90 for Chipotle, is attempting to trademark a series of phrases from her most recent album, including, ""Nice to meet you. Where you been?"" ""I could show you incredible things"" and ""Party like it's 1989."" At first glance, this is terrifying. Can we no longer explicitly greet people, show them incredible things or party in the way of the late '80s without Taylor Swift showing up in a police uniform fashioned into a crop top? (Also, how does Prince feel about all of this?)There's a lot of outrage. Including a metal protest song featuring a man yelling ""this sick beat"" (one of the phrases involved in the case). It does seem like the sort of unprecedented thing -- according to The Guardian, no artist has ever done this before -- that has major potential to shift the landscape of free speech. And yet, we have to look at this with regard for the way the industry has changed. Our pop stars are functioning in a marketplace that no longer yields revenue primarily from album sales, and a digital landscape in which simple phrases (even really innocuous greetings) have the power to go viral. Just in case it's not (depressing) common knowledge at this point: Album sales, in terms of physical CDs and general music purchases, has seen rapid decline since 2009. Much of this is due to accessibility, something that Swift was hyper-aware of in breaking up with Spotify back in November. ""1989"" debuted at No.1 on the Billboard Charts and sold over 1 million copies, numbers that Forbes argued could make it the last platinum album ever. Whether or not Swift breaks down that barrier with her next effort, the diminishing numbers can't be ignored. There remains a need for revenue outside of simply recording music.Then we have the factor of virality. The way songs, hashtags and phrases are spread across social media has a major impact on branding. When those items enter the pop culture vernacular, they not only increase awareness of a particular song but provide opportunities to profit off those songs outside of recording and performance. As Rihanna once said in regard to song-writing strategy: ""Tweet, retweet, trending topic.""That potential for exposure gives things as simple as ""Welcome to New York"" tremendous marketability. If Forever 21 churns out a pajama set reading ""Cause We Never Go Out Of Style,"" what are they really profiting from? Sure, there are people who would buy their rapidly disintegrating separates regardless of what words were printed on them in a factory in China. But the reality is that the virality of the term can be attributed to Swift and she deserves to profit from that in some way. That's what's really being targeted here -- third parties attempting to take advantage of the spaces she's carved out. There's no other way to combat that at this point.That said, there are obvious caveats here. The whole thing feels like a few steps away from us having to pay Tay $5 every time we experience heartbreak and / or romance-related emotions. What's more interesting than condemning the apparent greediness is looking at the mantle Swift has come to fill. In a mess of pop stars battling for agency and authenticity, we have in Swift a powerful business woman willing to fight for what she believes is rightfully hers. We are in need of a practical solution for the way reduced sales and digital dispersion have altered the music industry. The answer there is probably not calling dibs on catchphrases, and Swift's bound to make a few more mistakes in her quest for full ownership of her brand.

12,POLITICS,Here's The Biggest Problem With Obama's New Trade Push,Zach Carter and Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-worker-rights_n_6615974.html,,2015-02-05,"President Barack Obama pauses as he delivers remarks at the Department of Homeland Security on his FY2016 budget proposal, on Monday, Feb. 2, 2015, in Washington. Obama warned congressional Republicans Monday that he won't accept a spending plan that boosts national security at the expense of domestic programs for the middle class. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e7313c000066000dfe3b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In trying to win support for a controversial new trade pact in Asia, President Barack Obama has been offering one major reason why the deal is so important: to curb the economic power of China.""As we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region,"" Obama said during his State of the Union address last month. ""That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field.""The theme resonates with American workers, who have seen factories close and wages stagnate at home in the years since China joined the World Trade Organization and became a manufacturing powerhouse. But the credibility of Obama's pitch hinges on a difficult and unlikely diplomatic effort: reforming the economic and political structures of several smaller Asian nations -- in particular, Vietnam.Of the 11 nations negotiating with the U.S. over the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, none has a closer relationship with China than Vietnam. Like China, which is not participating in the talks, Vietnam has a one-party communist government with a long record of human rights abuses. It has also some of the world's weakest labor standards.As a consequence, Vietnam has become as an increasingly popular offshoring destination for businesses headquartered in China. Chinese companies regularly contract with factories in Vietnam, which in turn are overwhelmingly dependent on raw materials from China. One of Vietnam's biggest industries -- garments and textiles -- imports about half of its yarns and fabrics from its neighbor to the north.That means that higher labor standards in Vietnam would create higher costs for Chinese middlemen. And if TPP forces Vietnam and other Asian countries to improve workers' rights, that could put political pressure for reforms on the Chinese government. On the other hand, a weak deal with Vietnam would not rein in China's economic might; it could further empower the larger nation.The Obama administration recognizes the size of the challenge.""There are no labor rights in Vietnam,"" U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez told HuffPost. ""If the bar is Vietnam has to become the United States in the next five years, I don't expect that to happen. If the bar is to go from no labor rights to a scheme akin to the American and European schemes of labor protections, I think that is an unrealistic expectation.""It is a delicate maneuver for American negotiators to press the Vietnamese government on human rights violations, given the two countries' recently shared history. And Vietnam has been fighting against requirements for stronger labor rights throughout the TPP talks. Le Dang Doanh, a senior economic adviser for the general secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party, told the U.S.-funded Voice of America last fall that TPP's requirements are ""extremely difficult."" For TPP to make any difference on the labor front, it would have to enshrine workers' right to organize and form unions. Vietnam has only one officially sanctioned union, which critics say is often more closely allied with employers than workers.""Vietnam has shown no signs of compromising on this,"" Doanh told Voice of America, referring to legalizing unions. ""Vietnam has never wanted to make changes regarding this issue."" The Obama administration does not make public the language of proposed TPP provisions, and the deal is still being negotiated. But even if strong pro-labor terms could be secured in an agreement, actually enforcing them would be a greater hurdle.The U.S. has a poor record on enforcing human rights and labor terms under trade agreements. A 2009 Government Accountability Office report found that American enforcement of labor terms was ""ad hoc and very limited"" with ""minimal oversight."" Another GAO report from November 2014 found that the situation hadn't improved much. While the Labor Department has brought a handful of workers' rights cases under prior trade agreements, they have taken years to investigate and remain unresolved.""One of the critiques we've heard, especially from our friends in the Democratic Party and I agree with it, is that we need to move faster,"" Perez told HuffPost. ""I think that's a very fair critique, and it shouldn't take six years. These claims are complex, there's no doubt about it, but justice delayed is all too frequently justice denied.""Obama's latest call for a high-standards agreement essentially repeats a longstanding defense of U.S. pacts with rogue nations. In 2009, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), now chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, defended a free trade agreement with human rights abuser Bahrain, emphasizing that the deal would ""require things like the rule of law and forcible contracts, women's rights, advancements towards openness, transparency and democracy.""Two years after Ryan's comments, Bahrain's government implemented a brutal crackdown on Arab Spring protesters, with reports indicating that the regime fired and prosecuted union members, tortured doctors and imprisoned an opposition leader for ""inciting"" protests on Twitter. The Bahrain deal did, in fact, bar this kind of repression. But after receiving an official trade violation complaint from the AFL-CIO, the Obama administration took more than two years to initiate formal talks with the government of Bahrain. Almost four years after the initial crackdown the case remains open and unresolved, as Bahrain continues to prosecute human rights activists. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said last year that Bahrain's government had made ""substantial progress on the issue of dismissals of trade union leaders during the civil unrest.""The same enforcement issues would surely arise under TPP.""We are dealing with countries that are challenging in TPP,"" Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said in a January hearing. ""Brunei, where the LGBT community has legitimate human rights concerns. In Brunei and Malaysia and Vietnam, their record on labor is very suspect. And on anti-corruption, they could pass laws, but they don't have the institutions -- the independent prosecutors and courts -- to give us confidence that they would enforce those laws.""Perez said the Obama administration is taking a harder line in talks this time around than the U.S. has in prior trade agreements. The final deal, according to Perez, will deny countries the economic benefits of the trade pact until labor and environmental issues are addressed. That would be a significant change from past deals. ""If you want to compare the record of the Obama administration on enforcement with the record of the Bush administration, I welcome that comparison,"" Perez said. ""They didn't do anything."" But many human rights activists remain skeptical, including John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. ""The country is going to open itself to free expression? It's going to allow itself to have freedom of association, unions, trade unions, really? That's huge. That's not just, 'Oh' -- that's like the revolution almost,"" said Sifton.Enforcement against overseas trade violations has improved since Obama took office. But as the GAO reports indicate, that enforcement has been concentrated on disputes in which an American manufacturer raised a complaint. One key sector of the U.S. economy has incentive to turn a blind eye to labor improprieties in Vietnam and other TPP nations.Eager for more cheap overseas apparel, many American retailers have supported granting Vietnam expanded trade benefits. Although what remains of the U.S. textile industry has raised concerns, that sector has already been decimated and wields limited influence over executive branch politics. As for Vietnam, the garment industry is the source of its most economically significant U.S. exports, second only to China in the sale of clothing to America, according to a 2014 Congressional Research Service report.Elizabeth Cline, author of Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion, sounds a warning about any hopes for trade deal impact. ""In order to see real enforcement of labor standards, penalties for breaking the new laws cannot just fall on the producers and factories in developing Asian nations, but mainly on the Western retailers and corporations importing these goods,"" she said.From a human rights perspective, the garment industry in Vietnam is particularly troubling. According to a 2014 Labor Department report, the sector relies on both child labor and forced labor, while a 2014 State Department report documented labor trafficking in the garment sector.""Some Vietnamese children are victims of forced and bonded labor in factories run in urban family houses, particularly in the informal garment sector near Ho Chi Minh City, and in privately-run rural gold mines and brick factories,"" the State Department report reads. ""The most commonly reported tactic is for young men to lure young women and girls into online dating relationships; after gaining the victims’ trust, they persuade them to move to a new location where they are subsequently subjected to forced labor or sex trafficking."" ""There is no known record of a Vietnamese labor trafficking victim successfully achieving compensation in court,"" the report notes.Tuong Vu, a Vietnam expert in the University of Oregon's political science department, said of the Vietnamese government, ""They issue laws and regulations that sound very nice, but then they do not enforce them.""Bringing Vietnam into the TPP deal, Obama argues, would at least be better than the status quo.""I don't know how it's good for labor for us to tank a deal that would require Vietnam to improve its laws around labor organization and safety,"" the president said in December before the Business Roundtable, a lobby group that represents corporate CEOs. ""I mean, we're not punishing them somehow by leaving them out of something like this. Let's bring them in."" A marginal improvement, of course, is a far cry from Obama's call to alter the economic power dynamic between the U.S. and China.While China's holding of roughly 8 percent of the U.S. national debt is often noted to highlight the country's growing clout, its real power is over supply chains. Many essential goods sold in America are now either made in China or dependent on Chinese outsourcing companies, which in turn get their products from other countries -- like Vietnam.""The fact is, this is not going to achieve the strategic goals that the administration says are so important,"" said Barry Lynn, director of the Markets, Enterprise and Resiliency Initiative at the New America Foundation. ""Increasingly, it's Chinese companies that are determining where things go. And the idea that tinkering around with these numbers is going to have dramatic effects is naive."""

Because it was the late-80s, fast food was still totally acceptable, and so our small, wood-paneled station wagon would wind its way to Burger King or McDonald's. We'd go inside to eat. After, we'd get back in and drive somewhere else, usually to The Christmas Tree Shops or Building 19. We'd get to pick out a few things. It felt spontaneous and luxurious. We could tell that our mom was relaxed, happy to be with us and happy to be treating us to some memory-making. As a perfect juxtaposition to the delicious sin of late-80s fast food, today my shiny, un-wood-paneled Mazda5 pulled into the parking lot of Whole Foods for lunch. The kids were excited. I promised to let them hold their own plates at the make-your-own-crazy-expensive-bowl-of-random-food bar. ""And you guys can pick out one of those cookies, too,"" I said, before they could ask. ""Just remember not to touch."" They squealed, delighted.My daughter played don't-touch-the-white-squares, jumping from black square to black square, head down. ""Honey, you need to be aware of your surroundings,"" I said evenly."" You're almost jumping into people.""We ate our $30 (WTF) lunch.In the bathroom, to my son, ""You can't scream like that in the bathroom, sweetie."" ""But I can hear my echo!""Echos matter. So does leaping around with abandon. Public places are just 'places with more people in them' to kids. Don't get flustered here, Mama.The end-game was Barnes and Noble, as we had holiday gift cards to use. But before we got there, I made them walk through the ridiculously over-stocked cubes (they're not really aisles, are they?) of Bed, Bath & Beyond. I had a gift card to spend and had carefully mapped out exactly how I wanted to spend it: a Magic Bullet blender and an expensive pillow. After we found the Bullet, we wound our way through the store toward the pillows, stopping occasionally to gawk at the on-sale Frozen paraphernalia.I started resting my head awkwardly sideways on assorted white foamy rectangles -- while standing, of course, because how else can you reliably mimic restful sleep for a purchase like this? -- while the kids roamed in my general vicinity. At the check-out, we stopped, predictably, to weed through the light-up mini-swords with M&Ms in the bottom, the hand-held flower fans, and The Lego Movie pens. I bought them each a little something. I had a gift card, after all. We were on a Mystery Ride, after all.""Thank you, Mama,"" I said. ""Thank you, Mama,"" they parroted back.We got to Barnes and Noble and made our way to the back, where the kids books are. I was prepared for indecision and overwhelm, as those are my go-to emotions in bookstores, too. We roamed for ages and ages, hunting down books on sharks, astronauts, Wimpy Kids, and Elsa. I was committed to keeping them inside of their $25/each. They need to know they can't have everything they want.  ""Yes, you may get that. You have $5 left to spend."" We continued to roam. Eventually, we all had hands full of things to be grateful for. I paid, handing over three gift cards. ""Can we have these, too!?"" they said, bringing forth a stack of small notebooks. ""Not today,"" I said. We went and got some free water at the Starbucks inside of the bookstore. ""I want food here!""""We just had lunch. And you both got cookies. That's it for treats today.""And that's when the burnout really started smoldering. Because there was crying. And pleading. And while I know that crying and pleading are acceptable behaviors for children to exhibit, I just wanted to catch a break. I just wanted them, in that moment, to think about the day I'd just orchestrated for them. I wanted them to remember me sitting on the floor while they debated this book or that one. My patiently answering every single, ""Does this cost $5?"" as they worked to spend the last of their money. Them sitting on my lap when it wasn't their turn at the dentist. My encouraging them into bravery as they readied themselves to hop up in the big chair when it was. I wanted them to say, ""Oh, right, we already had a cookie!"" I wanted some damn gratitude. As we walked to the car, the protest against my lack of fairness continued.""You know,"" I began, my tone both steady and classically maternal, ""we just did a lot of fun things. You both got things you didn't expect to get. And instead of hearing about how grateful you are, about how much fun we just had, all I'm hearing is complaining. I don't like it.""I turned the music on and faded into my weary mind. As we pulled out of the parking lot, they said, ""Can we stop somewhere to see if they have Whoopie Cushions? Please?""I'm not sure how all of you do it. Are your houses in constant disarray? Are your closets full of un-used stuff? Is there laundry spilling out of baskets onto dusty floors?That's what it's like in my house.My husband and I spend all of our free time putting things away, cleaning, folding, budgeting, or paying bills. The other night, instead of doing any of those things, we decided to watch Louis C.K's new hour-long, which meant we woke up to dishes that needed to be washed. We simply can not make a choice like that without paying for it somewhere else.When we arrived home from our Mystery Ride, my husband was home. We came inside and the kids showed him what they'd bought. Seeing his face made my burnout sear hotter; he knows how I feel. I started quietly expressing my frustration. About how I feel like we could buy our kids the entire contents of F.A.O. Schwartz and they'd walk out of the store asking for an ice cream cone. About how our house is constantly in need of some sort of attention. How our kids ask us for help with everything; they seem unable to face even the smallest of challenges without calling our names. ""Mama? Can you come help me find the Lego I'm looking for?"" How the only time I have to work on my writing and event planning and all-of-the-other-things-I'm-making-happen is after they go to bed, the least-ideal hours of the day for me to be creatively productive. And while I'm about to have Tuesdays for personal work, those days are already becoming interrupted with other dentists's appointments and doctor's appointments and you can do your stuff another time. They need to have their teeth sealed.Which, of course. But also: When do things ease up a little bit.I often daydream of giving away most of what we own and moving into a Tiny House of some kind, with clever storage everywhere and only the bare essentials surrounding us. You get a box of crayons and you get a box of crayons and you can share this tub of Legos. ""Ooh! Thank you! This is wonderful!"" I imagine them saying.I dream of what it would feel like to sit and read for an afternoon, to not have that choice mean more work for later. I sometimes feel envious of the moms I know who split custody with ex-partners. They get days to themselves every single week. The life I imagine in these daydreams is so clearly not my friends' reality. But still: I love you. Now, please go away.There are solutions for this burnout. And I will promptly start seeking them out. In the meantime, I'm going to go read a new book.You can find the original post here, where it contains copious amounts of (well-placed) swearing. You can also get new posts from Emily (which, similarly, often contain well-placed swearing) in your inbox by clicking here.Check out Emily's Facebook page, where she tries to be funny, real, and as brave as she can be."

The Princeton Review created these rankings by developing a ""Return-on-Education"" rating based on a school's academics, graduates' career prospects and affordability -- including financial aid and grants for students in need.The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City topped the list, followed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvey Mudd College -- all well-known for their science, technology, engineering and math programs.Cooper Union, which has three schools -- focusing on art, architecture and engineering -- is the seventh most selective college in the U.S., according to U.S. News & World Report, and students are highly trained in professional skills.MIT students are also trained in technical and practical skills, and the university is known for its research opportunities and student inventions. Harvey Mudd, a small college in Claremont, California, also emphasizes STEM programs. These schools make good on financial aid promises. At Cooper Union, all admitted students are granted a scholarship to cover at least half of the tuition, as well as need-based aid. MIT guarantees that undergraduates whose families earn less than $75,000 a year attend the school tuition-free. At Harvey Mudd, a variety of merit-based awards are available to students, in addition to financial aid. The average freshman need-based gift aid is $39,641, the Princeton Review reports.So how do things turn out after graduation?At Cooper Union, the median starting salary for graduates is $61,400, and the median mid-career salary is $116,000, according to PayScale, a salary information company. Similarly, PayScale says the median starting pay for MIT grads is $68,600, which grows to $118,000 mid-career; at Harvey Mudd, the median pay to start is $73,300, and increases to $143,000 by mid-career.See who else made the Princeton Review's 2015 list:"

If you feel invisible, don't go through it alone. If you are worrying, don't go through it alone.",2015-02-05,A silhouette of three children bonding at sunset. Affection. Love. Relationships. Friendship.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e88072400005100540739.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a naturopathic physician and nutritional expert, I understand that physical healing is a small part of my job. We transcend skin and bones, and the physical is just the surface. People come to me wanting to feel and look better, but what I've discovered after decades of listening is that they are intrinsically looking for something deeper than that. They want to satisfy their most primal emotional need, which is to feel safe, loved, and important. To achieve optimal health, they must have both their primal physical needs and their primal emotional needs met. So to truly heal them, I need to address body, mind, and soul. Just like my patients, I have primal emotional needs. But what happens when I get stuck? After all, it's my job to inspire others to push past a negative mindset that's keeping them from feeling complete. But there I was, a few weeks ago, feeling broken. I knew why I felt the way I did. And in my mind, I knew I needed to get ""unstuck"" and move on. So in my mind, I said, NEXT! And I willed myself to move forward into whatever life had in store for me.But my heart said -- not this time, kiddo. Shoot. I thought about what I tell my patients. Don't feel pain alone. Don't worry alone. It's okay to pick up the phone and tell someone, ""I need support right now."" Have people in your life -- I call them your inner circle -- who you know will love and support you and your vision. And when you start to lose that vision, call them.However, reaching out and saying, ""Hey, I need to talk"" is not a familiar place for me. Frankly, it's uncomfortable. I am the ""rock"" in just about every circle of my life. But I know that people come into my life for a reason -- and that includes a friend who's had to grow up fast because of her life experiences. And with this comes a thick layer of wisdom and honesty. So I called her.This friend really gave it to me. She held nothing back. It was unadulterated tough love. I knew she would, and I knew she would also give me the wisdom and insight I needed. She was not talking rainbows and sunshine here. It was more like, ""You need to stand still and think. You need to remember all you've been through to get to where you are. I will let nothing stand in the way of what you've worked so hard for -- not even you!"" She refused to let me sabotage one more second of my life. After that call, I did stand still. I meditated. I thought deeply about what she said. The next day, I saw total clarity. Now that time has passed, I get it: My heart had to catch up to what my head already knew. I became unstuck and felt my strength reboot. Here's my point: If you are feeling stuck, don't go through it alone. If you feel invisible, don't go through it alone. If you are worrying, don't go through it alone. You don't have to. If you are like me, and feel that strength means you deal with things yourself, try and look at this sideways. What I have learned is it actually endears you to people when they see you are beautifully imperfect, just as they are. Helping you to feel safe, loved, and important helps them feel the same. And here's something else: Reaching out can stop you from making seriously unhealthy choices. For instance, I know that when I get stuck, I start looking for comfort foods. For other people, it's booze or drugs or cigarettes. There are reasons why we seek out these things when we're feeling low. We're looking for a ""change of state."" We're looking to change our chemistry in any way we can. Our bodies are smart, and what they're really looking for is feel-good hormones. A healing conversation can generate these same hormones -- without the guilt or regret later. So if you're stuck, and you're about to do something that will make things worse, make that call to someone you love and trust. Then stop, stand still, and think about what you're doing before you go totally off the rails. Trust me. You don't always need to be the rock. Sometimes -- just sometimes -- it's wiser to turn that job over to someone else."

This is one patient's story.When you work for WildCare, animals are never far away. Even on vacation, WildCare staffers and volunteers frequently encounter animals, both injured and well.This Leach's Storm Petrel was very lucky that WildCare personnel happened to be on board a cruise ship to Mexico the day he struck a window. He was even luckier that WildCare Ambassador Program Manager, Mary Pounder was walking the Promenade Deck at the time it happened.A crewmember had already spotted the bird as Mary approached, and as she leaned down to investigate, the crewmember shouted ""Don't touch it! It could make you sick!""Mary, knowing that there is nothing at all a human can contract from touching the feathers of a bird, reassured the crewmember that she worked for WildCare, a licensed wildlife rescue center, and that she knew what she was doing.Meanwhile Mary's husband David was calling the room of WildCare Director of Animal Care, Melanie Piazza, also on the cruise, to come do what she does best -- save a wild animal's life!The ship's crew member had alerted the on-board Environmental Officer, who arrived at the scene at the same time Melanie did. Apparently it's not uncommon for birds to strike cruise ships -- towering skyscrapers traveling at 21 knots that they are! At a loss as to what to do for them, crew members will usually place these fish-eating unfortunates in a box with some bread (!) to hopefully recover on their own. Most outcomes are poor.So this ship's Environmental Officer was thrilled to have actual wildlife medical experts on board. After clearing it with the ship's bridge, he gave permission to Melanie and Mary to take charge of the bird's care.A window-struck bird will be in shock. He'll probably have head trauma, and possibly broken bones. Subcutaneous fluids are one of the first treatments for shock so, after gently tucking the bird into a bag, the Environmental Officer and rescuers walked to the Medical Bay where Melanie asked for and received syringes and saline hydrating solution.Then they brought the bird to Mary's cabin, and turned up the heat to help warm him while Melanie performed a gentle exam.Without a radiograph machine, determining if bones are broken on a bird the size of a robin is a real challenge, but Melanie is an expert. Mary held the bird while Melanie gently palpated the bones of the wings, spine and legs. To her relief, no fractures presented. They knew the bird had hit his head-- a small patch of feathers over his right eye was disrupted, and the eye was swollen shut. Such a head injury can be very serious, but with luck this bird could recover.Melanie rehydrated the bird with subcutaneous fluids, and found an ingenious method to provide him with a heat source while he recovered. She borrowed two stones from the Hot Stone Massage room in the ship's luxurious spa! These stones are known to retain heat, so a few minutes in hot water kept them warm for a long time. Melanie tucked the stones into a wash cloth and placed them in the box with the bird. Now rehydrated and warm, the bird had a much better chance at recovering from his ordeal.Meanwhile, Melanie knew that the bird would be with them for a few days, and he'd need to eat during that time. A pelagic bird like a Storm Petrel isn't going to eat bread, obviously. He needed fish. A request for an interview with the ship's head chef quickly resulted in a fresh piece of raw fish from the kitchen. Cruise ships are astonishingly accommodating!The bird in his box spent the night in the cabin bathroom, and the next day Melanie and Mary decided to reexamine him, try to feed him and offer him the chance to swim, preen and repair his waterproofing. But here's a dilemma! How do you provide a bathing pool for a seabird in a cruise ship cabin? The sink, of course! Mary rigged a towel covering over the sink, in case the bird decided to try to fly, and filled the sink with filtered water (ship's water has a lot of chlorine, so filtered water was important). The bird paddled and preened a bit, and seemed reenergized by his bath. Melanie offered him a few small pieces of fish, which he refused. She gently pushed some pieces past his beak and into his crop, just to give him some calories.Back into his box with the warmed stones he went. He hadn't yet recovered, but Mary and Melanie were pleased to see him more alert and responsive than he had been the day before. The next day, the petrel was even more bright and alert, and his swollen eye was now open and clear. They could hear him pecking at the box, trying to figure out how to escape. Melanie wanted to release him as soon as possible if he had actually recovered, but she needed to test his flight abilities before letting him go. Again, a dilemma! How do you test a bird's flight without an aviary? Loft him gently into the air inside the cabin, of course. Over the bed so, in the event he couldn't fly, he wouldn't hit the hard floor and reinjure himself.On the second toss, this little bird flew beautifully within the cramped confines of the cruise ship cabin. With big smiles of relief, Melanie and Mary proclaimed him ready to be released.After checking the wind speed across the decks, the group trooped down to the port side of the aft Promenade Deck. There was no possibility of the ship's being slowed down for the release, so they knew, between the winds and the ship's speed, the first few moments of the bird's flight could be fairly chaotic. The rear of the ship made the most sense for the release, and the port side offered the best protection from the wind. As everyone crossed their fingers, Melanie faced the bird toward the wide ocean and then launched him into the air. As expected, the first few seconds of his flight sent him tumbling, and a gust pushed him back toward the ship's hull. But seconds later, the bird had cleared the ship and, as they watched, he flapped his wings and soared into the sky, free once more.Watch the bird's release in the video below.WildCare is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization supported almost entirely by private donations and individual memberships.

Consider how your whole body gets impacted by daily life. Right now, as you read this, is your body tight? Do you find yourself getting sidetracked and off-purpose? Are you caught up with worry about things that might happen or with concern about the past? When your attention goes to the noise your best intentions for yourself are undermined. The key is learning to sustain the connection with the source of guidance that lies within you.>Soon silence will have passed into legend. Man has turned his back on silence. Day after day he invents machines and devices that increase noise and distract humanity from the essence of life, contemplation, meditation. -- Jean ArpInner guidance requires focus and commitment. It is not just for use in times of crises. It is a way of living. It comes from a relationship that you actively develop over time. Eventually, you discover that you are able to rely on your inner wisdom and sensitivity for all the situations that life brings. It changes the way you live and your approach to everyday life. As you get to know this ""best friend,"" you won't feel alone because you know that you can trust your inner guidance.When you build a pattern of living from the inner connection, life works. It can bring you an experience of constancy and inner peacefulness. photo credit: vision via photopin (license)Do you know where to begin?1. Dedicate some ""check-in"" time with yourself each day. Allow time for uninterrupted silence. In the morning it can be a time to sit quietly with your upcoming day. Often you will notice a different priority rising to the top of your list. Pay attention to what emerges. There is timing for everything; your inner wisdom can provide different direction than your mental program. This can also be a period of evening reflection, where you might look back over your day. Was there anything you would have liked to have done differently? Is there something you want to celebrate? 2. Pay attention to the quality of your thoughts. Are you critical of yourself or those around you? Is there a belief that is out of date or self-limiting? Like attracts like. 3. What tone do you use with others when speaking? Notice what attitudes are present when your tone is less that it could be. Your tone gives you clues about how you are feeling towards yourself.  4. Notice how your body feels in situation throughout the day. Is it tense, anxious or uncomfortable? Tension is a clue to track what is needed at that moment. 5.  Pay attention to the synchronicities, coincidences, ""random"" thoughts, etc. Ask questions about what you notice. Go deeper.6. Does your day feel effortless? If not, what is in the way? If it does, acknowledge your connection, what you are learning and celebrate it. 7. Writing: Use writing as a way of dialoging with your inner self. Ask questions, write down the answers and read them aloud. Do the answers feel true? If not, take a few breaths, settle yourself and begin again. Relaxation is key.8.

Consider how your whole body gets impacted by daily life. Right now, as you read this, is your body tight? Do you find yourself getting sidetracked and off-purpose? Are you caught up with worry about things that might happen or with concern about the past? When your attention goes to the noise your best intentions for yourself are undermined. The key is learning to sustain the connection with the source of guidance that lies within you.>Soon silence will have passed into legend. Man has turned his back on silence. Day after day he invents machines and devices that increase noise and distract humanity from the essence of life, contemplation, meditation. -- Jean ArpInner guidance requires focus and commitment. It is not just for use in times of crises. It is a way of living. It comes from a relationship that you actively develop over time. Eventually, you discover that you are able to rely on your inner wisdom and sensitivity for all the situations that life brings. It changes the way you live and your approach to everyday life. As you get to know this ""best friend,"" you won't feel alone because you know that you can trust your inner guidance.When you build a pattern of living from the inner connection, life works. It can bring you an experience of constancy and inner peacefulness. photo credit: vision via photopin (license)Do you know where to begin?1. Dedicate some ""check-in"" time with yourself each day. Allow time for uninterrupted silence. In the morning it can be a time to sit quietly with your upcoming day. Often you will notice a different priority rising to the top of your list. Pay attention to what emerges. There is timing for everything; your inner wisdom can provide different direction than your mental program. This can also be a period of evening reflection, where you might look back over your day. Was there anything you would have liked to have done differently? Is there something you want to celebrate? 2. Pay attention to the quality of your thoughts. Are you critical of yourself or those around you? Is there a belief that is out of date or self-limiting? Like attracts like. 3. What tone do you use with others when speaking? Notice what attitudes are present when your tone is less that it could be. Your tone gives you clues about how you are feeling towards yourself.  4. Notice how your body feels in situation throughout the day. Is it tense, anxious or uncomfortable? Tension is a clue to track what is needed at that moment. 5.  Pay attention to the synchronicities, coincidences, ""random"" thoughts, etc. Ask questions about what you notice. Go deeper.6. Does your day feel effortless? If not, what is in the way? If it does, acknowledge your connection, what you are learning and celebrate it. 7. Writing: Use writing as a way of dialoging with your inner self. Ask questions, write down the answers and read them aloud. Do the answers feel true? If not, take a few breaths, settle yourself and begin again. Relaxation is key.8. Action: Taking action based on trust in your inner direction develops new life perspectives, a feeling of expansion and trust. Taking action builds a new way of life.What about you?

20,ENTERTAINMENT,Jeff Bridges Still Has The Jelly Sandals From 'The Big Lebowski',E. Oliver Whitney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-bridges-big-lebowski-clothes_n_6614216.html,,2015-02-04,"Jeff Bridges attends a ""Seventh Son"" screening on Friday, Jan. 30, 2015 in New York. (Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4a1b025000094003903d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jeff Bridges has been a lot of things: a stoner who loves bowling, a boxer, a computer programer, a country musician and even a ghost-hunting dead U.S. marshal from the 1800s. But there's a first for everything, including his latest character: a witch-hating, dragon-fighting, all-powerful master.That's Bridges' role in ""Seventh Son,"" an adventure fantasy that reunites the actor with his former ""Big Lebowski"" co-star Julianne Moore. She plays an evil witch-dragon hybrid and he's John Gregory, aka the Spook. (Sadly, they don't have a bowling dream sequence again.) But besides strangling giant bears and blowing glitter into a possessed child's face, Bridges has also recorded an album to help people fall asleep. (Hey, why not?) HuffPost Entertainment sat down with the Oscar winner to listen to him hum and find out how The Dude inspired many of his recent roles.You’ve said before that you like to resist working unless you’re really intrigued by a project. What was it about this film? I’m a big fan of myth, of Joseph Campbell and author Robert Johnson. Myths are these ancient stories that, if we pay attention to them, we can learn quite a bit about our current situation. This is the myth of the Seventh Son having special powers. That was intriguing. And reading Joseph Delaney's book The Spook's Apprentice, I really enjoyed that. Sergei Bodrov directed our film, knowing that he was going to be the head of this deal, and of course Julianne coming on board.Did she join the film after you did? I think so, yeah. Then production designer Dante Ferretti [""Shutter Island,"" ""Gangs of New York""] doing the sets. Seeing his sets just transcended all my expectations. Jackie West [""Argo""], the costume designer, and then Ben [Barnes], he was wonderful to work with. So it all came together like that.What was it like working with Julianne again? There was a sense of having a long weekend between jobs, but it’s been 17 years. She remembers it very well because she was pregnant during “The Big Lebowski” and her son’s now 17 years old, so that’s a constant reminder. Have you kept in touch since? A little bit. We’ve bumped into each other. It’s wonderful to play with her again. Even today was just a joy, the interviews, sitting in a room where you do one after another, 60, 70 times. But to have a playmate there, that makes it all the more fun.A lot of your recent roles, including this one, have been a wise, mentor-type character, from “True Grit” to ""R.I.P.D."" and of course ""The Giver."" Yeah, right! And I’ve got another movie coming out where I’m kind of a sage-like guy in “The Little Prince,” an animated film.You’ve been acting for so long, what’s it like to play that type of figure at this point in your career? That’s funny, I never planned it that way or thought too much about it. It just kind of worked out that way. Even The Dude -- I’ve got a buddy who’s a Zen master, Bernie Glassman. He told me a few years ago, “You realize The Dude, among many Buddhist circles, is considered a Zen master.”Yeah, there’s the Dudeist religion! I said, ""What are you talking about man!"" He said, “Yeah, the movie is full of modern day kōans. Look who directed the film, the Co-ahn brothers.” [Laughs] And we ended up writing a book called The Dude and the Zen Master. So that’s been in the cards, that character. There’s even a scene in this where your character is sitting and meditating in the mountains. Is that something you filter into a lot of your roles? Maybe so. I don’t know if it’s coincidence or fate that that aspect of my own life -- that’s kind of the first way I approach all the characters I play. What are some aspects that line up with my own life? Sometimes I’ll magnify those or kick them to the curb. Meditation is something I’m interested in and that applied to some of these recent characters. “The Giver,” I guess, probably did a lot of meditation.You’re also doing more movies that attract a younger audience. Do you have a lot of interactions with fans of a younger generation? Oh, yeah. I love that “Lebowski” has these Lebowski fests where it’s whole rooms full of people who love that movie of all different ages. My band, The Abiders -- our name is taken from that movie -- we’ve played several of the fests. It’s great to see that movie lives on and has an audience like that. When it came out not many people saw it.While you were making it did you have any idea -- Oh, yeah, it was funny as hell. And the Coen brothers are masters. But it was a bigger hit in Europe and then started to pick up steam. That’s one of my favorite movies, whether I was in it or not.Do you still have any of The Dude’s wardrobe from the film, a lot of which was famously taken from your own closet at the time? The Japanese baseball tee? The jelly shoes? Yeah, yeah, I stole that from my brother Beau, the shirt, I’ve got that. And those jelly sandals, those are mine.You also just released your sleep album you worked on for the Squarespace. How did you get the idea for that? I’m hoping that depending on the success of the website, to continue and make it an ongoing thing, but I was approached by Squarespace to do a Super Bowl commercial. They had a bunch of different ideas for me to pick through. We settled on this strange thing, ""Sleeping Tapes."" Just the title was so archaic: you know, ""tapes,"" that’s something from out of the past. So I started to really get more excited about it. My dear friend Lou Beach designed the cover and the four stories I read are his stories. We had Doug Sax, the guy who mastered Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon.”What was that process like, creating music to put people to sleep?  So you know the one where my wife comes in? So I’m out on the side of our house there in the morning doing -- [breaks into humming] -- just humming. And I end it, and she comes out and goes “What are you doing? You’re doing the ‘Sleep Tapes’ now?” And this is all like real time, so that’s on [the album track]. A lot of it’s done on an iPhone. I wanted it to have a funky feeling, not knowing where the mic is. Then mixing that with some things we did in the studio, some things we did on field recordings. We got to hike into Mescal Canyon, that’s the B Side. We had a ball. Then the clincher of the whole thing, the most important aspect of it is that all the sales goes to support No Kid Hungry. That’s a wonderful campaign all about ending childhood hunger in our country and not many people know how serious a problem it is.""Seventh Son"" opens Feb. 6."
