0,POLITICS,Prepare To Have Your Inbox Carpet Bombed,Ryan Grim and Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dccc-fundraising-emails_n_6430832.html,,2015-06-11,"In this May 1, 2014, photo, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., gestures during an interview with the Associated Press in Washington. House Democratsâ campaign arm said Friday it raised $7.3 million in May despite long odds of toppling Republicans from their majority. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e359240000300098f9dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party’s arm charged with winning House elections, outraised its Republican counterpart in 2014 by a substantial margin, and completely dominated when it came to small-dollar donations. Some progressive activists are panicking -- not because of the party’s fundraising success, but because of how they went about it, with a relentless fusillade of emails that spawned a parody Tumblr blog skewering subject lines like ""We've got nothing left"" and ""We. Will. Fail."" There is no question that the email program accomplished its immediate goal: to raise a fortune. The DCCC raked in over $70 million online in 2014, with almost all of those funds solicited by email. But progressive organizers worry that the DCCC, if it continues to blast away at its online activists, risks torching the very base progressives rely on. ""Everyone engaged in emailing with their members or supporters will need to figure out how to strike a balance between short-term results and maintaining this critical medium as a tool to allow ordinary people to exercise power in a vibrant democracy for years to come,"" said Ilya Sheyman, Moveon.org's executive director. As email technology advances, and Gmail in particular becomes more adept at burying unwanted emails in rarely checked folders, the ability of activist groups to reach their bases is put in severe jeopardy. The advent of Google Inbox, which aims to elevate important emails and push down the rest, heightens the challenge and raises the cost of excessive emailing.People are getting sick of it all. In 2014, all nonprofits saw an 11 percent drop in email fundraising response rates and a 25 percent drop in advocacy response rates, according to M+R Benchmarks. Yet those same groups raised 14 percent more online revenue, meaning that the same behavior that is turning people off is, at least in the short term, boosting revenue. The incentive to burn it all down couldn’t be stronger. ""The entire email industry has seen an increase in volume, which naturally would lend itself to an overall increase in the number of donations, while decreasing the response rates per any one email and that has so far proved to be true in the political sphere,"" said Nate Thames, the technical services executive director at ActBlue, a nonprofit platform that channels donations to Democratic campaigns. And yet, former DCCC chair Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) has rejected any suggestion that the committee’s apocalyptic emails have played any role in hastening Democratic online donor fatigue. In a January interview, Sirius XM Radio's Ari Rabin-Havt asked Israel, who stepped down from the post in November after the election, about the contrast between the congressman’s publicly upbeat rhetoric and the committee’s frantic, depressing messages. DCCC digital communications directors ""understand that there are certain messages that motivate people more effectively than other messages,"" Israel said. ""For us to do emails telling people about how we're going to win the majority back and there's nothing to worry about and people can just sit back in their couches and wait for victory, that's not going to provide the resources, the motivation we need to go out and win elections.""Israel said he doesn't see any contradiction between the organization's consistently alarmist fundraising emails and his ""cheerleader"" role for the party as former DCCC chair going into the election. Israel had previously said, in regard to the message he communicated to candidates prior to the election, that ""You can’t be going out there and telling people that the sky is falling,"" because ""it tends to hurt recruiting and fundraising."" Though the DCCC outraised its GOP counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, by more than $40 million and brought in more than triple what the NRCC did from donors giving less than $200, Republicans still managed to increase their domination of the House of Representatives, giving them their biggest majority since 1928.""Yeah, I know, there's no question our emails can get pretty persistent but here's the thing: We don't have the Koch brothers, and we don't have these well-connected Washington groups that can spend unlimited amounts of money to advance their special-interest agenda,"" Israel said. ""We have our grassroots.""Despite Israel’s assurances, some corners of the progressive universe are concerned that doom-laden emails could have vote-suppressing effects. For instance, a progressive activist with a national grassroots group told The Huffington Post that he was worried such messaging tactics could become standard among grassroots organizations. The activist didn't want his name used so as not to alienate the Democratic establishment.There are two major possible concerns with these tactics, he said: One, the sheer number of messages people are receiving, and, two, the chance of a steady stream of panicked emails turning people off. ""At every practice you have people who just want to burn the place down to get maximum immediate impact,"" the activist continued. ""The danger is more in copycats, other people who say, 'Oh, this is a best practice.' And what the field needs to do is say there is another way to do it. Certainly [the DCCC] made a ton of money. The thing we don’t know is if they had sent a more engaging string of emails, could they have raised even more?""In a pushback to that criticism, a DCCC spokesman provided data showing that the committee's online list is composed of mostly habitual voters, to make the argument that the stream of emails didn't have vote-discouraging effects.And yet some digital experts -- like Michael Conlow, Blue State Digital’s technical director who was the deputy chief technology officer for President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign -- think Democratic campaigns and committees need to start thinking of their supporters as messaging partners rather than just an ""ATM machine"" heading into the 2016 presidential election. At a June 10 event on campaign technology hosted by Politico, Conlow suggested that Democratic supporters wouldn’t be willing to share a candidate's message with friends and family if they are only asked to contribute financially. Betsy Hoover, a founding partner of the Democratic consulting group 270 Strategies who served as the director of digital organizing for the 2012 Obama for America campaign, added that ""smart campaigns"" will focusing on building relationships and trust with their supporters in the early stages of the 2016 election. ""We were joking about us giving you a break right now, but I do think ... if you’re really running a digital strategy the right way, you’re building a relationship with your list over time,"" Hoover said. ""The moment that level of email is going to be effective is in moments of urgency, when people understand the consequence of giving right now, or taking action right now. You can't run at that pace from now until Election Day and no one is prepared to do that."" Interestingly enough, one of the defenders of the DCCC’s email tactics at the event was Zac Moffatt, who served as former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s digital director for the 2012 cycle. Moffatt said he imagined DCCC staffers were constantly monitoring the number of list unsubscribes versus the return rate of the fundraising emails. ""It's always this funny thing that everyone says, 'I want to know the data, I want to know how everything works.' If you don't think that they know they're making more money than the rate they're wearing through the list, why is it someone's gut on the outside who’s a reporter telling you they're sending you too much, making that determination for them?"" he asked. ""These groups would know the rate at which they're burning through their list, there are a lot of people looking at it the entire time. Sure, they are spammers to a degree as they go through the process, but you’re seeing these returns,"" he added. ""You will see it all ramp up next year because everyone’s getting good at it now.""Moffatt said that while presidential campaigns were the ones historically ""hoovering up"" the small-dollar donations, congressional campaigns and committees were catching up. ""I think this is probably the first cycle where we'll see that scale, which might freak people out,"" he said. "
1,POLITICS,A Court Case Pregnant With Advice and Counsel,"Joseph Cooper, ContributorColumnist, PsychologyToday.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-court-case-pregnant-wit_b_7504952.html,"By the end of June, the U. S.

S. Supreme Court will deliver its decisions regarding same-sex marriage and, as well, the healthcare law whose controversial provisions include some contraception and abortion coverage. Before delivering any dissents or affirmations, politicians - presidential hopefuls, in particular - might do well to have their advisors study a 1965 Court decision, and the strange oral arguments made by the respondent (appellee). Fifty years ago, seven Justices of the United States Supreme Court voted to nullify two Connecticut statutes that had perpetuated ignorance and intolerance.In their landmark decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (announced June 7, 1965), the Justices ""aborted"" prosecutions brought under a statute that criminalized the use of contraceptive devices. Another statue - an ""aiding and abetting statute"" - had been used to prosecute those who dared to inform and advise married couples about contraception. My fingers did not hit the wrong keys in typing the above. Those statutes made it a crime - a crime - to aid a woman - even a married woman - who sought to manage her pregnancies, her health: her life. The statutes facilitated the arrest, prosecution, and conviction of ""accessories"" - those who dispensed healthcare information in response to inquiries from married couples seeking such advice. To nullify such prosecutions (to de-criminalize such counsel and care), the Justices had to overrule a Connecticut trial court, an intermediate appellate court, and the state's highest court, all of which had bowed to parochialism and religious pressures to keep the 1879 proscriptions alive, and threatening. Convicted of ""aiding and abetting"" were Estelle Griswold, the Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut and her co-defendant (and co-appellant) C. Lee Buxton, an eminent obstetrician-gynecologist and the Medical Director for the League at its center in New Haven.In oral argument before the U. S. Supreme Court, the lawyer for the state (the appellee) justified the prosecutions and convictions as ""a valid exercise of Connecticut's police power."" Seeking amplification, the Chief Justice asked, ""What is the purpose of this legislation?"" The reply: ""to reduce the chances of immorality.... to act as a deterrent to sexual intercourse outside the marital relationship.""The lawyer for Connecticut was given the opportunity to ""walk back"" or adjust his reply: The Chief Justice asked, ""What is the police power purpose of Connecticut in telling married people, two people who are married to each other, that they cannot use contraceptives?""The reply: ""If Your Honor please, it's just to preserve morality.... to control the result of what we call a dissolute action, that is, fornication and adultery."" The lawyer for Connecticut went on to explain that ""not all married people are immune from temptations or inclinations to extramarital indulgence.... the problem is that if contraceptives, say, are freely sold, dispensed, or otherwise used, even to married people, how can it be known that they will be used within the marital relationship? Not all people are immune from adultery."" The lawyer's reasoning seemed to be taking him to the presumption that any married person seeking contraception was doing so in order to engage in ""adultery or extramarital fornication or non-marital fornication."" And thus, he argued that the provider or disseminator of contraceptive devices was ""aiding and abetting something which is a criminal offense."" The Justices asked whether there were health issues and concerns that should override the enforcement of the statutes.The reply: ""there has been testimony in the legislature by doctors, prominent in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, that there is no medical necessity for the use of contraceptives, absolutely none. It's not a medical problem. It may be a social problem, but it's not a medical problem.""As to pregnancy prevention, the lawyer justifying the enforcements went on to offer his own medical ""evidence"" regarding the ""pinpointing of ovulation to one day in a cycle."" He then declared that if this finding of a Boston gynecologist ""works out, then contraceptives - that is, devices that are being used to prevent pregnancy - will be passé. There'll be no need, there'll just be no need.""  No choice: unplanned pregnancy, unplanned parenthoodAs to the ""social problem,"" he went on to aver that a married person seeking contraception resources was probably doing so not as birth control, but as ""pregnancy control"" - and thus was contemplating extramarital intercourse by reducing the risks of conception, and the fallout therefrom. When pressed to explain why the statutes did not infringe on a married couple's right to avoid pregnancy, he declared that ""married couples do not have freedom to do what they want.""  Griswold v. Connecticut may not be the key factor in the U. S. Supreme Court's forthcoming rulings on marriage or abortion. Nevertheless, the Court's June 7, 1965 opinion, and its dismissals of Connecticut's parochial and prosecutorial arguments, should give some presidential aspirants cues as to postures and positions they might best terminate early term."

I pointed to the picture below, asking readers if they could pick out which of the two men was competing in a race, and which one was in the movie, Apocalypto.It was a joke. The whole blog was a joke in fact, further evidenced by it's publication in the ""Comedy"" section of the website.But a hundred-plus comments and a full Twitter feed later, it was clear that, at least in this whey-protein-addiction circle, I was not just a ""nerd,"" but a ""half-vagina,"" a ""regular"" vagina (which I suppose would be a full-vagina), even a ""so-so vagina,"" and a bunch of other names that spread over my Twitter feed like an online germ, and all from a group of people who love nothing more than to crawl into and out of forest fires on a Saturday afternoon -- for fun.Ironically, I was baking a nice rosemary and thyme bread* when this mention was coming in.*Guys, a good bread recipe is just as important as a good chicken soup recipe. I have both. I'll hook you up._______For the majority of my young-but-starting-to-see-grey in my beard-life, I've worked from home. Which means for the latter third of my life, I've essentially been a SAHM, or stay-at-home-man. I've had years to practice becoming a twenty-first and a half-century man. Like our ancestors who had to adapt a millennia ago, I've adapted. Evolved. Into what is today a perfectly deft man, capable of a myriad of things that were once thought to be ""something a woman does."" But I'm perfectly fine with that.This only means that you won't find me bench-pressing 300 lbs (Is that a lot or not a lot? See, I don't even know.), but rather I'll make you (or your girl after I steal her from you) a nice iced ginger tea with real ginger and real mother-fucking lemongrass that I snip from its little potted home next to the window sil.After tea-time, I might do a little ""Pinteresting"" and get some ideas on how to build that perfect shelf with a couple of iron brackets that my girlfriend and I found at a flea market. That's right. Twenty-first and a half century-man goes to flea markets. And she might even come home from work one day and find that shelf on her wall, cause that's how I roll, bitches.I can make a mean bed in the morning, too. Sure, it's not just because she leaves damningly early, but because I can. ""Do you want the yellow pillows in front of the patterned ones? Wait... which pillows go there and which go here?"" I also know that the buttons on the duvet cover go on the bottom. You don't have to tell me.And I know what a fucking charger is, too. I'm not some heathen._______During the sporadic minutes here and there of free time that I have, I'll vacuum. Because a clean house is a fucking happy house. Plus, why not?Laundry? Sure. Consider it done. I know that using warm and hot water is a total waste of resources, and that in some cases, cold water actually does a better job of cleaning and maintaining the fabric. And I know that washing clothes by material, not color, makes them last longer. I'm not an idiot.At some point in the late afternoon, I'll go food shopping for you. Pffft... bfd. Text me a list, babe. Ya, that's right. Go fuck yourself modern man. I love to go food shopping. I'll run circles around any twenty-first century man when it comes to food shopping. If ""Supermarket Sweep"" was still on the air today, I'd enter to be a contestant and I'd win whatever it is that they used to give away as prizes. Although, in all honesty, this guy isn't on my team. He is not twenty-first and a half century-man._______But twenty-first and a half century-man is a hybrid. We too, just like our predecessors, are outdoorsmen. We can do manly things like barefoot run, bike a hundred miles in a weekend or rotate our tires on our own. Home repairs? This is what YouTube is for._______Any good relationship requires a few things; trust, acceptance, transparency, compromise and the ability to communicate, which might be the most important and perhaps a reason that for every 6.8 couples who marry in the U.S., 3.6 of them get divorced.Maybe it's just because of the sex these couple aren't having, which a 2013 study by the American Sociological Review claims to be happening with married men doing more chores around the house. They didn't, however, factor in that it could just have been the marriage and not the fact that the guy is washing the dishes (or the bigger factor that the data was collected between 1992 and 1994).A typical text from the girlfriend of a twenty-first and a half century-man._______The new modern man is here, so deal with it. We listen -- actually listen -- and not just pause the game while we look glassy-eyed at her as she talks about her day or which friend is doing what.We download ovulation apps on our smartphones and sync them together because sex involves two people, after all. It's her body, will always be her body. So if she's going to let me use her body for pleasure, then it's only fair that I take an interest in every part of it. Not just what I see above the covers._______The blood of the twenty-first and a half century-man might not be flooded with casein protein and l-carnitine, but what we lack in sweaty, brute force aggression, we make up in other ways. Taking out the trash is so 1990.◊◊◊Image credit: Illustration by Robert NeubeckerChris Peak is a freelance writer from Boston. Follow him on Twitter."

Sweet. Acrylic, 30"" by 40"" diptych.Perhaps it was inevitable that I would eventually end up interviewing family - as I am not the lone artist in our bloodline. So, as a photography and arts blogger, it made sense to corner my aunt, painter Susan Sweet, and try to squeeze a little more than an artist statement out of her. Here is my attempt.  Hearts and Flowers, (c) 2008 Susan N. Sweet. Acrylic, 24"" by 24"".Michael Ernest Sweet: Why paint? I always ask this of painters and they usually don't like the question, but too bad, I want to know?Susan N. Sweet: I paint because I can't stop. I will often do almost anything to avoid getting started, but then once the paint hits my brush, it is what I want to do and where I want to be. It is the form of art making I am most interested in. I look at everything and imagine how I might paint what I see. The more immersed I am in a painting, the more the world around me breaks down into colours and planes of light, and how I might describe them.Michael: My grandmother (your mother) was a creative person in many ways, having operated a business, Lady Martock Fashions in Sleepwear, for a couple of decades after retiring from teaching. She both designed and made these often elaborate, almost Victorian, nightgowns. It wasn't painting or photography, but she certainly was designing. Do you think she had any influence on your life as an artist? Susan: My mother, Muriel, was the only art teacher I ever had in my first thirteen years of school. She taught art in the basement of Windsor Elementary, and was my teacher in Grade five. I think she was a bit hard on me as I was her child and she never wanted to appear biased. She was supportive of everything her children pursued and not that concerned with how much financial success we achieved, as long as we were happy and doing okay. I think that was her influence on my career in art making - just do what you want and try to be happy. Her true impact on my life, all our lives, as you know, is very hard to articulate. Young Mabel, (c) 2014 Susan N. Sweet. Acrylic, 20"" by 16"".Michael: Your maternal grandfather was also an artist. In fact, he was a wood carver of some note that depicted domesticated animals. Could some of your animal art be genetic, or is it simply a product of growing up in the Nova Scotia countryside?Susan: Probably a bit of both. I did not know either of my grandfathers, both died long before any of us were born, but I was very familiar with his wood carvings, a very primitive style of Nova Scotia folk art. I like the idea of continuing the subject matter that was such a part of all of our lives.Michael: Familiar indeed! One advantage to interviewing a relative is that I know some of the stories. For example, many of those wood carvings of your grandfather's encountered some damage. Could you tell us about that and the ensuing irony?Susan: That story featured prominently in my 2008 solo show ""Broken Horses, Spotted Cattle"". When I was five and my brother, your dad, was four, our mother had gone back to teaching and left us with the housekeeper. I was not happy about that. So, I enlisted the help of my brother and we quietly went upstairs to the flat my grandmother lived in and got into her cabinet full of the wooden carvings and broke the legs and tails off of as many as we could. My mother was furious and, of course, wanted to punish us, but my grandmother, also a teacher, said no, they are just little children and they don't know what they've done. Of course, I did know what I intended to do, and that was hurt my mother for leaving us to return to work, but what I didn't know was the hurt I had caused my grandmother and how she understood my feelings. I still have many of the broken carvings. A few years after the incident we did attempt to repair them, but of course it was too late. Cow Horse, (c) 2012 Susan N. Sweet.  Acrylic, 30"" by 20"". Michael: All of your animal paintings are exquisite. Many people tell me that you are able to capture the personality of their pets. When you paint horses I, personally, find something really magical about them. Do you think your relationship with real horses growing up helps you in your artistic work? Are you able to talk, or whisper, to horses?Susan: No, I am not a horse ""whisperer"". I do talk to horses, all of us horse people do that. For many years I breathed and lived horses. I do think my personal relationships with horses have helped me when drawing and painting them. Having grown up with horses and been around them daily for a very long time, one understands how they are built and how they move. There is a long history of equine art throughout the centuries, humankind has had an important relationship with horses that enabled our ancestors to travel, hunt, work the land, etc. Michael: Indeed, we see beautiful examples of equine art from prehistoric times in the caves at Chauvet, for example. So, yes, we do seem to have been drawing them from the very beginning. You were recently commissioned to paint the official 250th anniversary commemorative painting for the Hants County Exhibition. My grandfather (your father, Ernest Sweet) was President of the exhibition for many years, including the 200th anniversary, how do you think he would feel about this if he were alive? Susan: Oh, I think he would be delighted and quite pleased that I was approached to paint such a special commission. He loved Exhibition week. This fair is the oldest fair in North America and moved to its present location in 1951. My dad would have participated in livestock competitions beginning in the late 1930s, when the fair was held at the Fort Edward Hill in Windsor, Nova Scotia.  Exhibition Painting, (c) 2015 Susan N. Sweet. Acrylic, 36"" by 32"".Michael: Grandad was an avid supporter of rural life and agriculture - having held other positions at The Atlantic Winter Fair and the NS Agriculture Association, for example. He also farmed (in some way) most every day for likely close to 70 years. What impact does this heritage have on your work?Susan: I do find most of my subject matter comes from rural life. Horses, cattle, and the land, all figure prominently in what I paint. I am always interested in how we treat our domesticated animals, both the ones we eat and our companion animals. I feel very fortunate to live in a rural area where I am close to where our food is grown and where we are concerned with what happens on the land. Urban areas are so exotic to me! My father was an avid horseman. He worked the woods and the fields as a young man with horses, and his love of these things influenced me greatly. I also saw what happened to so many people as the family farms slowly disappeared. As my father slowly sold his own farming assets over the years, I became involved with horses and competing at the same fairs where he had shown his own cattle years before. Phyllis, Millicent and Jody, (c) 2012 Susan N. Sweet. Acrylic, 32"" by 37"".Michael: During your BFA, at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, you worked in painting and photography as well as printmaking. The photography stuck with you for some time afterward, and of course you still paint, but what about the printmaking? Susan: Printmaking became just too hard after I left the open studio environment of university. I found both intaglio and lithography a fascinating form of art making, but technically overwhelming, and I don't feel my work was all that memorable from my university years. I do still find myself drawn to prints, especially intaglio. Nova Scotia has some fabulous print makers thanks to the department run by Ed Porter and Bob Rogers at NSCAD University for many years.Michael: I often marvel about the lifespans of so many artists (and photographers too) it seems (from my casual survey) that so many live such long lives. I think about Alex Colville, whom I knew, and how he worked into his nineties. Do you think there is something therapeutic or particularly healthy about a life as an artist?Susan: Oh my goodness no! I do know of many older artists, in fact the gallery where I work summers represents a 92 year old who is still painting, but I am sure many other professions can offer up such individuals too. I often think there are so many toxic materials artists use in their work and that we are putting ourselves in danger! I don't have a sense of calm when I paint. Painting for me is always a struggle and a challenge when it is being pulled from my heart. I find no relaxation in painting. I am focused though, and I can paint in public with no problem. It doesn't bring me contentment though, not really. I am happy when I am painting, but it is the hardest thing in the world. Vivian, (c) 2015 Susan N. Sweet. Acrylic, 24"" by 24"".Michael: For a while you went in a direction that was a bit more commercial with your Animal Art business (earrings, brooches, ornaments, even small drawings of pets) but more recently you seem to have returned to fine art. What inspired this shift away from business woman, if you will, back to les beaux-arts?Susan: I needed to say something in my work that could not be achieved through a commercial practice and taking a risk to paint what matters to me seems to be working. I also worked very small for many years and my body was rebelling against the ten hours of sitting every day. I still produce commercial portraits of animals for clients, but I follow my heart and luckily people do respond to my current body of work. Michael: Often many artists reach a point in their career where teaching becomes an option - that is, schools seek you out. This can also be an important income supplement to support personal projects. Have you ever thought about teaching part-time, perhaps a class at your old alma mater?Susan: I would be the worst teacher ever. I have conducted an occasional workshop, and those are fun. Many people in our family are teachers, and really good ones - I am not one of them.Michael: Not only living in a more remote rural area, but also working in a home studio can become quite isolating, I would imagine. How have you dealt with this, perhaps more negative, aspect of the creative life?Susan: It does mean that one must work very hard to be noticed. We've become reliant on the internet to communicate so much. I like living and working in a rural area, and even my rare excursions into civilization only involve small towns and cities. I think we sometimes miss the positive aspects of peer criticism working so isolated, but the area where I live has many other artists working in various media. I can also have my studio right in my home. The Percheron King, (c) 2012 Susan N. Sweet.  Acrylic, 36"" by 24"".Michael: In the years when you and I both lived at the family home in Martock, we often fought like brother and sister, or cats and dogs. I think this has a lot to do with my obsessive compulsive tendencies and your ""artistic"" messiness, If I can express it this way. Oddly enough, we both ended up as artists, and would likely live under the same roof more easily now. Or would we?Susan: Oh, we are much more mature now. Or at least I am! We would easily get along. I am still extremely messy though, be warned, that hasn't changed. Come here anytime, there is lots of room to work! Michael: I'd love to, believe me. New York City is wonderful, but it's a very BIG kind of wonderful and sometimes I long for the quiet of the countryside. To finish up, tell me, who has influenced your work as an artist?Susan: I admire the work of Rosa Bonheur. She could really paint a horse! Joe Fafard of Saskatchewan is fabulous. Mary Pratt of Newfoundland. Edward Hopper, David Hockney, Tom Thompson (and any of the group of seven) and Emily Carr. There are so many I admire, but in the end, I find I can only paint the way I do. Simone, (c) 2015 Susan N. Sweet.

In the interview, the hospital's director asks him about his research. ""I was trying to extract myelin from millions of earthworms,"" he explains.""But that's impossible!"" says the director.""Yes, but now we know it's impossible,"" says Robin Williams' character.I recently had an opportunity to recall this scene. I was traveling back to Baltimore from Europe. Whenever I make this trip, I use the eight or so uninterrupted hours to do a lot of work. This time I was reading a giant stack of Striving Readers reports, because I am working with colleagues to update a review of research on secondary reading programs. Striving Readers, part of Reading First, was a richly funded initiative of the George W. Bush administration that gave money to states to help them adopt intensive solutions for below-level readers in middle and high schools. The states implemented a range of programs, almost all of them commercial programs designed for secondary readers. To their credit, the framers of Striving Readers required rigorous third-party evaluations of whatever the states implemented, and those were the reports I was reading. Unfortunately, it apparently did not occur to anyone to suggest that the programs have their own evidence of effectiveness prior to being implemented and evaluated as part of Striving Readers.As you might guess from the fact that I started off this blog post with the earthworm story, the outcomes are pretty dismal. A few of the studies found statistically significant impacts, but even those found very small effect sizes, and only on some but not other measures or subgroups. I'm sure I and others will learn more as we get further into these reports, which are very high-quality evaluations with rich measures of implementation as well as outcomes. But I wanted to make one observation at this point. Striving Readers was a serious, well-meaning attempt to solve a very important problem faced by far too many secondary students: difficulties with reading. I'm glad the Department of Education was willing to make such an investment. But next time anyone thinks of doing something on the scale of Striving Readers, I hope they will provide preference points in the application process for applicants who propose to use approaches with solid evidence of effectiveness. I also hope government will continue to fund development and evaluation of programs to address enduring problems of education, so that when they do start providing incentives for using proven programs, there will be many to choose from. Just like the earthworm research in Awakenings, finding out conclusively what doesn't work is a contribution to science. But in education, how many times do we have to learn what doesn't work before we start supporting programs that we know do work? It's time to recognize on a broad scale that programs proven to work in rigorous evaluations are more likely than other approaches to work again if implemented well in similar settings. Even earthworms learn from experience. Shouldn't we do the same?"

When the militants laid out an ultimatum -- convert, pay a tax or be killed -- thousands of Christians and other religious minorities fled to neighboring cities, like the northern city of Erbil. Even though it’s been more than a year, Erbil’s Chaldean Catholic leader, Bishop Bashar Warda, still vividly remembers what it was like to watch the streams of refugees enter his city.“It was [a] really sad occasion,” Warda said in an interview with Vatican Radio. “The memories that we have is the queue of thousands of people arriving, tired, crying and leaving behind everything, memories and properties.”Warda said the situation just became “more painful” as time went on. “At least [during the early days], there was ... a hope that it would [end] soon and they would be able to go back,” the bishop continued.The Brookings Institution estimates that Iraq now has nearly 3.5 million internally displaced persons, or IDPs, a large number of whom have sought refuge in the Kurdish Region of Iraq. IDPs often lack access to adequate shelter, healthcare, food and water.Other refugees have fled to neighboring countries like Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Mosul's Syrian-Catholic Archbishop Monsignor Yohanna Petros Mouche visited Ireland this week to ask for humanitarian aid -- and to ask the government to support the resettlement of Iraqi refugees to Western countries. ""I am calling on the international community: if they cannot protect us, then they must open their doors and help us start a new life elsewhere,"" Mouche said, according to Christian Today. ""But we would prefer to be in Iraq and be protected in Iraq.""Warda calls what’s happening in Iraq a genocide.“You cannot say genocide is just killing the body,” Warda said. “When you kill the memories, when you kill the past, when you destroy the culture, when you destroy homes, when you destroy the future.

Reich joined a panel testifying on the topic of 'Income Inequality in the United States.Ã (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ffdd3c000066000e04e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story originally appeared on Capital & Main.It’s no secret that former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich has some misgivings about the direction of the American economy. But the prolific writer, radio commentator and longtime University of California, Berkeley professor isn’t thrilled about how we are educating our kids, either.As part of a new project with the activist group MoveOn.org, Reich recently released a video that described our education system as “squashing passion for learning, eroding the love of teaching and grinding up generations of young people.” The critique is accompanied by a set of proposals to reinvent American education – one of 10 planks in a broader agenda titled “10 Ideas to Save the Economy.”Reich has addressed the nation’s education challenges in his books, including 2011’s Aftershock: The Next Economy and America’s Future, as well as in his 2013 film Inequality for All (available on NetFlix, iTunes and DVD). But rarely has he been so blunt in his assessment or his prescriptions.Capital & Main spoke last week with Reich about his views on how the country has failed its kids, and what it must do to right the ship.Capital & Main: Have we bought into a collective myth that the answer to economic inequality is better education, when in fact there may be more immediate solutions that could help tens of millions Americans struggling today?Robert Reich: Education is not the only answer and it’s certainly not the immediate solution. At best, it’s a necessary, but not sufficient response to widening inequality.C&M: How would you grade President Obama and his education czar, Arne Duncan?Reich: They’ve certainly brought a lot of attention to education — in terms of attention I’d give them an A. Unfortunately, the emphasis has been on standards and on testing. This is not unique to the Obama administration [and] as much as I understand the importance of setting benchmarks and having tests to assess whether students are learning, we have gone way overboard on testing. Many students now are learning to take a test rather than to think. Teachers are being promoted or given raises based upon their ability to teach students to succeed on the test rather than to teach students how to solve problems and to come up with new ways of viewing problems. So I would grade the administration far more harshly because of its emphasis on standards and grades.C&M: Many of the recommendations you make in the MoveOn video seem relatively non-controversial: increasing federal funding, limiting class size, boosting pay of teachers, offering high school students technical training. Who’s opposing ideas like these?Reich: Well unfortunately many do not want to increase federal funding at all. They are afraid of the federal government, they hate the federal government. These are the same state officials who don’t want to accept federal funding to expand Medicaid. In terms of limiting class size, some education officials pay lip service to this but if you actually look at class sizes, they are getting larger. That’s hardly because there’s not enough federal funding to overcome the fiscal drag of local property tax revenues that are very low in poor districts. Some states have to tried to overcome this fiscal drag by providing more funding to poor districts, but politically it’s difficult for these states. The rich districts don’t want to share. So the federal government really does have to come to the rescue.In terms of technical education I don’t hear many voices out there that are pushing for a world class technical education system. To the contrary, we seem to have bought into the conceit that the only way into the middle class is through a four-year college degree and every child therefore should get one. That’s a cruel and unnecessary demand. Not every child is suitable to a what is necessary for getting a four-year college degree. Not every child should have to get one in order to get into the middle class.There are many jobs out there that require what might be called technician skills: installing, upgrading, improving upon, maintaining complex machinery. A lot of it is digital. It’s entirely possible that the last year of high school and the first year of college or community college could be devoted for some students to mastering a domain of technical knowledge that would thereafter set them up to learn on the job. Other countries have first class systems of technical education and apprenticeship which is something we should also be investing in. Germany’s skilled machinists and assembly workers are some of the best in the world. which is why it continues to be a net exporter with regard to manufacturing, even though German wages are quite high.C&M: In the MoveOn email that accompanies your video you say that powerful special interests see schools as sources of potential profit. Who are these special interests and how do they profit from public education?Reich: I think you are referring to the part of the video that talks about for-profit higher education. That’s really become a racket. What we need to do is move toward a system of free public higher education. There are also a lot of profits in the financial services industry that is now charging students an arm and a leg for student loans at exorbitant interest rates — far higher than prevailing interest rates — because students and their families are so desperate. So I would criticize those two profit-making industries who are really making a pay on the backs of working students, working families, poor students, poor families.C&M: Do you believe, as some people have charged, that there is an ideological war on teachers in this country?Reich: Undoubtedly. Teachers have been scapegoated by those who don’t want to invest more in education. Who don’t want change. Who are personally happy with the status quo but feel that because the public is so unhappy with education, it’s easiest to scapegoat teachers. The fact of the matter is teachers are underpaid relative to other professions. The law of supply and demand in terms of wages is not repealed at the doors of our school houses. We are paying investment bankers and Wall Street traders, the people who are in charge of our financial capital, hundreds of thousands of dollars a year — many of them millions of dollars a year, a few a billion dollars or more. Yet we are paying teachers who are in charge of our human capital, arguably more important than our financial capital, a very tiny fraction of what Wall Streeters are paid.C&M: Why are so many liberals and progressives embracing charter schools, parent trigger laws and other elements of the so-called education reform movement?Reich: I don’t have anything against charter schools if they adhere to minimum public standards, and if they don’t select their students — skimming the cream off in advance — and don’t kick students out who don’t meet the grade. I mean those kinds of charter schools who really are taking on public responsibilities by accepting all students, or at least selecting on a random selection basis and keeping students who are difficult to teach, but keeping them in the classroom and doing the best for their students, then all power to them. We need a variety of educational experiments and charter schools can be a part of that.C&M: You call in the MoveOn video for making public higher education completely free. How do you propose paying for that?Reich: Raising taxes on the wealthiest members of our society who have never been as rich as they are now. Whose effective tax rates are extraordinarily low relative to what they were 10 years ago, 30 years ago, 50 years ago. And who have a social responsibility to invest in the education of everybody else’s kids.C&M: Millions of Americans are drowning in student debt. Even as they struggle to find a decent job. Do you believe that we should have universal student debt forgiveness?Reich: I think that we need to allow all students to declare bankruptcy, to use bankruptcy laws. We also should forgive debts of students who have essentially have been hoodwinked — either by for-profit colleges and universities that promised them a quality of education that they never got, or by financial intermediaries who are charging them double-digit interest. Third, we ought to allow students to refinance their loans at today’s low interest rates. Fourth, we need to allow our students who are in debt to roll over their debts into a kind of income-contingent debt system whereby they can agree to pay a certain amount of their yearly full-time salary over a certain amount of time.And finally I think we’ve got to move to a system of free higher education. That would solve all these problems. I should add that free higher education is not a radical idea. When I first came to the University of California, Berkeley in the late 1960s as a research assistant, tuition and fees at Berkeley were almost zero. We’ve been there. We’ve done it and succeeded with free higher education and we need to return to an idea that worked."

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ffc5220000ba01dd8736.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, in a remarkable act of bipartisan statesmanship, Senator Patrick Leahy and Senator Mike Lee joined together to guide the U.S.A. Freedom Act (a trimmed down version of the so-called Patriot Act) to passage over the objection of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. This strange bedfellows pairing continued last night with the unanimous passage of a Senate Resolution celebrating the ratification of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which collectively constitute our nation's Second Founding.For too long, the story of this transformational moment in American constitutional history has been overshadowed by what came before. The 150th anniversaries of the Civil War were rightly greeted by an avalanche of commemorative coverage and analysis. Even 150 years later, it's clear that the wounds of the Civil War are not completely healed, nor the questions of its turbulent aftermath wholly answered. But despite these historical and political rifts, there is one thing that can and should unite all Americans, as it has united Senators Leahy and Lee and a unanimous Senate: The wisdom and importance of the constitutional changes wrought by the Civil War and Reconstruction. These anniversaries also deserve coverage and analysis during their sesquicentennial years. In what scholars call our nation's ""Second Founding,"" leaders like John Bingham, Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner fought for and secured the passage of a series of transformational Amendments: the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. While our nation continues to divide over many questions, the enduring principles enshrined in these Amendments remind us of what unites us as Americans. First among these Amendments is the triumph that was the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which transformed our nation's charter from an aggressively pro-slavery document to one that explicitly prohibits that pernicious institution. In light of its unquestioned acceptance today, it's easy to forget that President Lincoln spent the last months of his life waging an aggressive campaign for the Amendment's passage, including his decision to take the extraordinary step of signing the Amendment before sending it to the States for ratification. While the Thirteenth Amendment stands as a monument to a vital, necessary and (today) uncontroversial constitutional change, the Fourteenth Amendment remains the focal point of serious constitutional debate -- at street corners, at our kitchen tables and in courtrooms throughout the nation. Indeed, it is the critical provision at issue in the Supreme Court's historic consideration of marriage equality, a decision we're awaiting in a matter of weeks. It's little wonder why. This Amendment contains some of the most soaring (and important) language in our Constitution, providing birthright citizenship to anyone born on American soil, protecting fundamental rights from state abuses, and enshrining Jefferson's famous call for equality into our nation's charter. Americans may disagree, including the Resolution's cosponsors, over how to apply these critical protections to particular issues, but no one denies their importance to our nation's unifying creed. Finally, this period of constitutional transformation ended in 1870, with the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which banned racial discrimination in voting. While we continued to debate how to apply this protection to hot-button topics like state voter ID laws, no one thinks that access to the ballot box should be determined by the color of one's skin.Taken together, these transformational Amendments set the stage for remaking our country into the ""more perfect Union"" originally promised by the Constitution in 1787. They wrote into our Constitution the ""new birth of freedom"" that Lincoln spoke of at Gettysburg. Nevertheless, in our collective reverence for George Washington, James Madison and our other Founding Fathers, these Second Founding Amendments -- and the profound changes that they enshrined in our nation's charter -- are all too often overlooked and underserved. As these Amendments turn 150, they deserve a celebration that's worthy of their place at the center of our nation's constitutional story. And the names John Bingham, Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner should be as familiar to every American as James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Benjamin Franklin. That's why Constitutional Accountability Center, the National Constitution Center, along with Second Founding Committee Honorary Chair Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and a growing list of partner organizations, are spearheading a celebration of the 150th anniversary of this Second Founding. The resolution championed by Senators Leahy and Lee is an important beginning to a larger nationwide celebration. As a nation, we have spent the last four years learning about and reflecting on what divided us -- doesn't the aftermath of that war deserve equal reflection and celebration of what can and should unite us as we continue to strive towards building a ""more perfect Union?"""

The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a trade framework negotiated between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. AFP PHOTO / POOL (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d42355280000db2c6fde20.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week, the House of Representatives faces a critical question: Should it endorse ""fast track"" approval of trade deals negotiated by the president? A massive new trade agreement -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership (""TPP"") -- hangs in the balance. The agreement is shrouded in secrecy because under national security provisions, its text is classified. We do know that the agreement will be between the US and eleven other countries. From draft chapters released on WikiLeaks, we also know enough to want to slow down -- not to speed up -- deliberation on the treaty. According to the leaks, a key aspect of the TPP will be the provision of ""investor-state dispute settlement"" (ISDS). The name sounds innocuous, but its content puts at risk core elements of the American legal system -- America's commitment to open courts and equal treatment. Domestic investors, along with ordinary people, bring claims to court when they believe that they have been harmed by government action. But under the ISDS provisions, thousands of foreign companies would gain the right to opt-out of the public court system and instead to use private, ad hoc arbitral tribunals to challenge any number of US laws that the companies argue harms their profitability. The current proposed TPP did not invent the ISDS system. Based on the track record so far, it appears that when foreign investors use the alternative ISDS process rather than regular courts, taxpayers and government regulation are often the losers. There are several reasons to object to the extension of ISDS into this new proposed trade agreement -- which, if approved, would give an even larger pool of foreign investors the right to opt out of normal courts. Thus far, several companies have succeeded through ISDS processes in winning multi-million dollar claims against countries and in pressuring governments to cut back on health and environmental regulations. Under the international agreements to which the US is a party, governments have reportedly been forced to pay $440 million to foreign investors in ISDS proceedings. Equally problematic is the pressure that such decisions put on domestic laws, regulations and policies. For example, in 1997 a chemical company brought a claim against Canada over its ban on trade in a toxic gasoline additive known as ""MMT."" After negative preliminary decisions in an investor-state proceeding, Canada settled by paying the company $13 million and then withdrew its ban on MMT. Companies have attacked not only environmental regulations, but also health laws through the ISDS process. In 2011, Australia enacted one of the world's toughest tobacco labeling laws. The ""plain packaging"" law -- celebrated by the World Health Organization as a model for other countries -- requires graphic public health warnings to cover most of cigarette packaging, and requires that the brand name be in a plain print at the bottom. The multinational tobacco company Phillip Morris rapidly filed claims in two venues -- in the Australian courts and in an investor-state tribunal under a Hong Kong-Australia investment agreement. Australian courts rejected the company's argument that the country's law appropriated its intellectual property in an unconstitutional manner. But the ISDS proceeding continues, causing the Australian government to have to pay the costs of defending the claim in an investor-state dispute system, and if it loses, subjecting it to substantial damages. Phillip Morris continues to press its argument that its property has been illegally expropriated and also claims that the Australian labeling law undermines its right to ""fair and equitable treatment"" under the investment treaty. As more claims are filed, a wider range of companies -- and their lawyers -- have begun to see the possibilities of using the investor-state process to challenge laws and decisions they do not like. For example, in 2010 and 2011 Canadian courts invalidated two patents held by Eli Lilly, a major multinational drug company. Patent law has three major requirements: inventions must be new, useful and non-obvious. The Canadian courts held that the company had not proved the utility of the inventions claimed and therefore Lilly lost. In 2013, after the company's appeals were denied by higher courts, Eli Lilly launched an investor-state claim against Canada. The company is seeking some $500 million in damages, and it is now arguing that Canadian courts' interpretation of their own law amounts to ""expropriation"" of the company's property, and is ""arbitrary, unjust, and discriminatory.""In short, ISDS offers a way for foreign corporate investors to try to undercut a country's laws and regulations by triggering a private dispute system. The results can be taxpayer dollars lost to foreign investors and government regulations limited, even though those very laws protecting health, the environment and safety have been duly enacted by legislatures and their applications upheld by domestic courts. There are many reasons for concern here, but a critical one is the way that ISDS proceedings undermine domestic court systems, and the precept of ""equal justice under law"" for all. Americans are justifiably proud of our judicial system. Both state and federal constitutions insist that courts be ""open"" -- both to those bringing claims and to any of us wanting to watch judges and disputants as claims are pursued and decided. Everyone is entitled to those rights, regardless of wealth or influence. Further, state and federal constitutions require that judges be independent and not beholden to the parties. If judges own stock in a company or have special relationships with a litigant, they have to step aside (""recuse"" themselves) or be disqualified by law from judging the case. But ISDS proceedings do not protect the values of openness, equal treatment and judicial independence. Investor-state dispute arbitrations are available only to a select and powerful group: foreign investors. Only they -- and no one else affected by trade treaties that include these provisions -- can bring a private suit challenging governments for allegedly failing to live up to their agreements. Moreover, foreign investors get to help pick the decision-makers. Many of these arbitrators also act as lawyers (often, for companies) in these same tribunals, and so these legal insiders have a stake in the expansion of the kinds of claims that can be brought to these tribunals. Courts are also required by constitutions to keep their doors open so strangers can observe. ISDS proceedings have long been criticized for being far less transparent. The leaked TPP draft does include some new obligations concerning transparency, but the meaning of these obligations will be decided by the same insiders. Further -- as in the practice of arbitration more generally -- these ad hoc arbitration tribunals are not bound by precedent. Nor are they subject to meaningful oversight through appellate review. Arbitration of the sort envisioned in the TPP, as far as we are aware, has no real review at all -- only an ""annulment"" proceeding, which cannot even set aside a decision on the grounds that it is based on an incorrect statement of the law. The justification for granting foreign investors different and special rights to opt out of local courts goes back decades, to eras when court systems in many places were fragile and the goal was to attract foreign investment to fledgling nations. Investors had understandable concerns about weak domestic court systems that did not guarantee independent judges and equal treatment. Further, investors worried that governments might decide to seize foreign assets and that local judges would be vulnerable and would fail to hold their own governments responsible. But these are not the characteristics of court systems in Canada, Australia, the United States and many other countries where ISDS is now becoming entrenched. In fact, the court systems that have recently been bypassed through ISDS set the global standard for their commitments to fair and independent process and the rule of law. Furthermore, where court systems are troubled, they need to be fixed rather than bypassed by foreign companies, while domestic investors and regular citizens are left to use those very courts. This issue is not a partisan one: Elizabeth Warren and the Cato Institute are not regular bedfellows. But they both have come out strongly against ISDS. It is time to slow down these negotiations, and have a public discussion about the nature of the ISDS commitments being contemplated in the TPP. Instead of a fast track out of U.S. courts, we need a careful deliberation about what role ISDS should play in our system of justice. _______________________________Pictured at top: US Trade Representative Michael Froman (L) and his Japanese counterpart Akira Amari (R) at TPP negotiations at Amari's office in Tokyo on April 19, 2015.

Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) speaks about immigration during a news conference on Capitol Hill, January 9, 2015 in Washington, DC. Rep. Gutierrez talked about plans to help educate immigrant communities and prepare for the implementation of the executive actions on immigration announced by President Obama in last November. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ffc425000094003a5f9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has spoken a lot about the corroding influence of large sums of money on the American political system. He regularly warns about the harmful effects of climate change and Republicans' failure to confront it. And he frequently laments America's standing in the world on inequality and paid sick leave. But an issue you may not hear him speak as frequently about is immigration, as one leading Democrat on immigration reform noted Thursday.Speaking with Larry King on his show, ""PoliticKING,"" Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) gave other Democratic presidential contenders like Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley passing grades on immigration. But Sanders, who announced his run for the White House last month, failed to make the cut. ""I don’t know if he likes immigrants, because he doesn't seem to talk about immigrants. But sooner or later he’ll tell us. I hope he likes immigrants. I haven’t heard him say anything. He’s been kind of quiet and silent. So I hope that when he sees this program he sees that there’s a lot of people waiting to hear from him,"" said Gutierrez, a member of the House Judiciary Committee who advocates on behalf of comprehensive immigration reform.A spokesperson for Sanders' campaign pointed to the senator's long record in support of immigration reform, including his vote in favor of the Dream Act, a legislative proposal that would have granted deportation relief to undocumented immigrants who came into the country as children.Gutierrez is notably the first member of Congress to call out Sanders on an issue that has dominated the debate within the Democratic Party in recent years. But he's not the first progressive to do. Last month, MSNBC host Chris Hayes noted that Sanders would have trouble on his path to the nomination without courting members of the coalition that twice elected Barack Obama to the White House: minorities, women and young people. Over at the conservative Washington Examiner, Byron York similarly wrote that Sanders' ""progressive whiteopia"" lacked focus on issues like immigration and race and policing, especially in the wake of protests in Baltimore, New York and Ferguson, Missouri.Sanders hasn't been completely silent on challenges faced by both Hispanics and African Americans. On Wednesday, he delivered a speech on the floor of the Senate tying the issue of unemployment to incarceration rates of minorities. And on Thursday, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials announced Sanders would address its annual conference of policymakers in Las Vegas later this month and speak ""on the issues most important to the Latino community.”“The answer to unemployment and poverty is not and cannot be the mass incarceration of young African Americans,” Sanders said in the Senate on Wednesday. “It's time to bring hope and economic opportunity to communities across the country.”Gutierrez, a leading proponent of immigration reform on the Hill, argued in his interview with King that immigration would continue to be on the forefront of the Democratic agenda because of wide support among the American electorate. ""The majority of Democrats in this country believe in immigration reform. The majority of Independents believe in immigration reform. The majority of Republicans believe in immigration reform. Unfortunately, the majority of those that sit in the House of Representatives do not, and they're stymying the future of our immigration promises,"" he said."

""If we lose our freedom to be inspired, we're going to look up one day and the entertainment industry as we know it will be frozen in litigation,"" he said.Last month, British music producer Mark Ronson added an additional five writing credits to his chart-topping hit “Uptown Funk” in response to The Gap Band claiming similarities between the track and their 1979 funk anthem “Oops, Up Side Your Head.”   So has the “Blurred Lines” case forever altered the music business for musicians? The answer, according to legendary musician-producer Nile Rodgers, is no. “This is what we do as musicians. We listen to other people’s music, we get inspired,” Rodgers told The Huffington Post prior to performing at the annual Apollo Theater Spring Gala earlier this week. “Sometimes we do direct interpolations. And in that case, if there’s a real legal argument there, they probably should have – meaning Pharrell, T.I., and Robin [Thicke] – probably should have copy written it as an interpolation. Because yes, the intro is close, but the intro is not the song,” he added. “If they didn’t have that intro you would not think that was a derivative of Marvin Gaye. So that would’ve been the smart move instead. I don’t know why they didn’t do that,” he said.In addition to his work with Chic and Sister Sledge, Rodgers has crafted hits for the likes of David Bowie (“Let’s Dance”), Diana Ross (“Upside Down”), Madonna (“Like A Virgin”), and in recent years collaborating alongside Williams on Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky.” With such an expansive collection of hits under his belt, it’s easy to consider the 62-year-old’s production credits as one of the most sampled catalogs in music. Yet despite inspiring legions of artists, the Grammy Award winner maintains that he has no intentions of challenging any artists who have sampled his impressive repertoire of work. “My own personal way that I look at it is, is there an artist –- and I’m not being egotistical at all –- is there an artist whose music has been sampled, or there’s variations of it, more than my music? What if I sued everybody who made a record that sounded like one of my songs,” he said. “I’ll be in court my whole life [laughs].”“The very first time Pharrell Williams set eyes on me I was sitting at the Grammys, and he was walking down the aisle -– and he and Justin Timberlake just had a big hit record with ‘Rock Your Body,’"" he recalled as he hummed the melody to the song. ""I mean come on, if that’s not a derivative of ‘Good Times’… And he knew it right away. He looked at me and he bowed down.”Rodgers is currently in the process of completing Chic’s first new album in over 20 years, ""It's About Time."" Meanwhile, he credits Kool & the Gang’s 1974 top ten hit, “Hollywood Swinging”  for inspiring him as an musician to create Chic’s number one single, “Good Times.” “If I didn’t love Kool & the Gang, I would’ve never wrote ‘Good Times,’” he said. “Kool & the Gang did ‘Hollywood Swinging.’ We all do that. That’s music and that’s progress. And that’s how songs and motifs, and licks, and ideas evolve. This is a natural thing.” “Every now and then somebody sues somebody over something because it’s either very close to it or they feel the person has ripped them off, or they just want to make money,"" he continued. ""I don’t know what the motive is in this particular [“Blurred Lines”] case, but I don’t think it’s going to have a long lasting effect on the business.” "

The hidden problem of elder abuse, according to the National Clearinghouse on Abuse in Later Life (NCALL). Here's what you should know about this serious social problem. Elder abuse isn't a new phenomenon. But awareness of the problem is relatively new. One of the first public reports on elder abuse was published in a 1975 British Medical Journal paper, which described the occurrence of ""granny battering"" or ""granny bashing."" By the mid-1970s, America had awakened to reports and articles on battered and abandoned elders that were documented in professional literature. The initial response to these reports was disbelief and denial, which turned into public outrage as soon as elder abuse stories hit the mainstream media.Elder laws and definitions can vary widely. Each state has created statutory laws that address elder abuse, neglect and exploitation. These statutes can differ greatly.Defining elder abuse would seem straightforward, but it's not. The National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA) states that definitions vary, the problem is mostly concealed, and what actions or inactions constitute abuse are hard to pin down.In broad terms, elder abuse can be defined as ""any knowing, intentional, or negligent act by a caregiver or any other person that causes harm or a serious risk of harm to a vulnerable adult."" Elder abuse is a complex problem. The NCEA provides general categories of elder abuse. Domestic elder abuse is mistreatment toward an elder by a person in a trust relationship with him or her in a home setting, whereas institutional elder abuse is committed by a person who has a legal or contractual obligation to him or her in a residential setting. Seven types of elder abuse are physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional and psychological abuse, neglect, abandonment, financial and material exploitation and self-neglect. America's growing elderly population is a contributing factor.The older population is expected to rapidly grow between 2010 and 2050. U.S. Census Bureau data show that the number of seniors aged 65 and over will double, from 44.7 million in 2013 to 88.5 million in 2050. With the projected growth in the elderly population, the prevalence and incidence of elder abuse will likely increase.Elder neglect is the most common type of abuse.In a domestic setting, neglect is the most common type of abuse (55%), followed by physical abuse (14.6%), financial and material exploitation (12.3 percent), emotional abuse (7.7 %), sexual abuse (less than 1 percent), and other types of abuse (6.1 percent), as reported by the NCEA. The extent of the elder abuse problem is largely unknown. No one knows how many older Americans are victims of elder abuse. A conservative estimate says that every year about 2.1 million older Americans are victims of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation.For every one elder abuse case reported to the authorities, roughly five go unreported, according to NCEA prevalence data. The number one risk factor for elder abuse is vulnerability. Vulnerable older people are susceptible to the abusive behaviors of people who hold negative views toward elders. Other risk factors for elder abuse and neglect include dementia and cognitive impairment, transgenerational violence, personal and financial problems of the abuser, and environmental conditions.Elder abuse is usually perpetrated by someone the victim knows and trusts. Family members were the perpetrators in about 90% of cases of domestic elder abuse and neglect, according to The National Elder Abuse Incidence Study. Adult children are most often the perpetrators of elder abuse, followed by other family members and spouses, according to the American Psychological Association (APA). Forty-two percent of murder victims over 60 were killed by their offspring, while 24 percent were killed by their spouses, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report. Elder financial abuse can be just as devastating as other forms of abuse. The MetLife Study of Elder Financial Abuse revealed that older victims of financial exploitation lose about $2.9 billion annually. Study findings also showed that about 60% of perpetrators of financial crimes against the elderly are males aged 30 to 59.The same study found that women were twice as likely to be victims of elder financial abuse, as compared to men. Most victims were aged 80 to 89, lived alone, and depended on others for medical or financial assistance.Gender matters in the calculus of elder abuse. Women are at greater risk to become an elder abuse victim during their lifetime, according to The National Elder Abuse Incidence Study. Study results also found that women were the victims in 76.3% of cases of emotional or psychological abuse, 71.4 of physical abuse, 63% of financial/material exploitation, and 60% of neglect. Men were the majority of victims (62.2%) of abandonment. Community-based organizations are available to assist victims and their families.Should you suspect that a family member or a relative is being neglected, abused, or exploited, your first call should be made to Adult Protective Services (APS). Other state resources to go for help include Area Agencies on Aging, Long-Term Care Ombudsman, law enforcement, legal services, and domestic violence programs. Preventing and combating elder abuse is everyone's responsibility. We can all do our part to create healthy and safe community environments for our elderly loved ones, relatives, neighbors, and friends."

On top of trying to finish the sixth book in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, he's also juggling a handful of other book and TV projects and public appearances. And the last thing Martin has time for are your ""Game of Thrones"" complaints.It's no surprise to ""GoT"" fans that this year has been full of heated debates and controversies over the latest episodes. Season 5 alone has (spoiler alert) been condemned for its Sansa rape scene and the violent death of Shireen Baratheon with constant, unending backlash resulting in viewers -- and U.S. senators -- quitting the show. But hey, Martin wants you to stop bugging him about it.In the author's most recent post on his LiveJournal, Martin asked his readers and fans to stop sending him so many emails about ""Game of Thrones."" After all, Martin writes the books and didn't pen any episodes for the HBO show this season or next, so it's sort of out of his hands. ""It is not my intention to get involved in those,"" Martin wrote of the recent controversies, ""nor to allow them to take over my blog and website, so please stop emailing me about them, or posting off-topic comments here on my Not A Blog.""Martin already responded to Sansa's rape scene in the show (which doesn't happen to her in the books), emphasizing the differences between the HBO series and his novels. He further reiterated this in his blog post on Wednesday. ""What I can control is what happens in my books,"" Martin wrote, ""so I am going to return to that chapter I've been writing on The Winds of Winter now, thank you very much."" In other words:The Season 5 finale of ""Game of Thrones"" airs Sunday, June 14, at 9:00 p.m. ET on HBO. "

Despite the reassurance that you're more likely to win the lottery or be struck by lightning than end up in an aircraft accident, you still can't brush off all nervousness when it's time to board and news headlines of tech glitches and turbulence don't help the cause. Here, we explain a few bumps that may cause flying anxiety.What happens: Before taking off, the flight crew announces that ""bumps are expected.""What it means: ""Bumps expected"" is one way to say that the flight path may include turbulence, though the details on how strong and for how long either aren't known or aren't serious enough to warrant a sterner notice. Dr. Chris Manno, a pilot, professor, author, and current Boeing 737 captain for a major U.S. airline, is trained to deal with turbulence, but notes that the aircraft is just as primed to take whatever weather throws at it. ""Structurally, our aircraft is designed to withstand stress much higher than anything we might encounter in flight,"" he explains. ""The invisible 'chop' we encounter in flight may be startling, but it's hardly a challenge to our airframe. When we encounter turbulence, rest assured that we are immediately taking whatever action we can to smooth the ride out -- just give us a minute."" For to-the-minute knowledge of the situation, try downloading the SOAR app, which gives the turbulence forecast.What happens: The pilots make an announcement asking flight attendants to suspend service and take their seats for turbulence ahead.What it means: In a recent report on what fliers need to know about turbulence, we explained that your best friend during turbulence is your seat belt, as the Federal Aviation Administration says there are between 30 and 60 cases of turbulence-related injuries each year. That said, pilots have ways to avoid turbulence with the potential of causing injuries.According to Manno, these are some of the tools pilots have at their disposal: ""We have the most advanced radar in the sky that digitally analyzes air currents and predicts then displays potential choppiness in multicolored depictions. The radar is synched with our navigation system so that it always knows the topography we're flying over and automatically focuses on weather hazards. Also, pilots constantly share reports of turbulence via air-to-air radio. Finally, the meteorology department at every major airline gives the pilots a pretty good idea of what to expect along our flight path."" Still, the usual idiom ""better safe than sorry"" still applies, and Manno reminds that ""areas reported to be choppy can smooth out, and smooth areas can inexplicably become bumpy, but we'll do our best to make it smooth sailing all the way.""What happens: The airline is experiencing a tech ""glitch"" that's affecting flights.What it means: If you're ready to fly and the airline is mired in tech issues, there's no telling how quickly or easily the solution will arrive. Usually, the most frustrating piece of being wrapped up in a day like this is dealing with extended wait times and the overloaded and stressed customer service agents. When, in April, American Airlines dealt with a glitch in the iPad app its pilots use for navigation, the resulting flight delays only averaged one or two hours. Last week, United Airlines was forced to ground all of its flights for a grand total of 45 minutes while a computer system issue was fixed (flights already in the air were not affected). Every minute a glitch continues, every cancelled or delayed flight, means lost revenue and inconvenienced or confused passengers, so airlines have incentives to handle these situations quickly.What happens: Some of the noises I hear coming from the airplane make me nervous.What it means: The fact that jet aircraft, made up of millions of parts and flying through the air at hundreds of miles per hour, are quiet enough inside to allow for regular conversation is a marvel of engineering. Still, you aren't flying in a vacuum, and some noise is inevitable. For instance, a Boeing 747--the ""Queen of the Skies""--is made up of six million pieces. With four engines, an upper level, and a flying range of nearly 9,000 miles, you can expect the plane to have an orchestra of whirrs and clicks that differs from the smaller jets travelers may be more used to. The Airbus A320, for example, has a distinct noise, usually likened to ""dogs barking,"" that occurs when the plane is taxiing. According to Patrick Smith, aircraft captain and author of Cockpit Confidential, this noise is ""akin to a motor repeatedly trying--and failing--to start, and there's often the assumption that something is malfunctioning."" In actuality, that puzzling noise is a routine function attributed to the power transfer unit, or PTU, which relates to the hydraulics of the plane and is nothing to worry about.What happens: The gate agent announces that the flight you're waiting to board has a ""mechanical delay.""What it means: An airline has the responsibility to send you safely into the skies, which occasionally means there will be last-minute checks, double-checks, triple-checks, or an entire aircraft substitution. Mechanical delays can be caused by a range of issues, not all of which are critical; we've experienced these setbacks for everything from safety issues (a fire detector in an engine failing) and instrument glitches (a cockpit display simply not powering on) to a stubborn in-flight entertainment system (the seat-back TVs refused to turn on). In the end, all issues were fixed or a substitute aircraft was found before reaching the runway for takeoff.During a mechanical delay, it is most important to stay near the gate and listen for updates, gate changes, or even free vouchers for airport meals or a hotel night while you wait. Airlines have no control over the weather, but if a delay is caused by something that does under their control, you may have a right to accommodation or compensation depending on the length and severity of delay and how it relates to your itinerary.For more on remedying a fear of flying, check out our list of steps for easing pre-flight stress, or consider enrolling in a structured program, such as SOAR or Virgin Atlantic's (UK-only) ""Flying Without Fear"" courses.More from Condé Nast Traveler: THESE Are The Best New Hotels in the World The Most Dangerous Foods You Can Eat The Top 25 Spas in the United States The Best Cities on Earth Private Islands That Cost Less Than an NYC Apartment 10 Most Underrated American CitiesAlso on HuffPost:"

I spent the entire first year of her life working, traveling and building my business. Caught up in my own busyness and striving to achieve some idealized notion of success I painfully realized on her first birthday that I had few real, joyful memories from that year. It was in that moment that I made the decision to live differently -- as a parent and an entrepreneur. I wanted to savor the small joys of each day, to be as present and engaged in this moment and to no longer let busyness drive my life. For the next 10 days, I'm inviting all those busy dads, stepdads, grandfathers, uncles, brothers and sons to reconnect with the joy, passion, and fun in their lives. Each day there will be a new joy tip or strategy for you to try. Why does this matter? Your life with a lot more joy awaits you. And who doesn't want -- or need -- that?! Am I right, guys?Day 1: Decline or Shorten a MeetingMoments of joy often require that we are fully present to our life and not merely reacting to the deluge of calls, emails and to dos that come our way. To be more present in the here and now you need some space on your calendar. Open up your calendar and look at your meetings for this week. Select one and answer the questions below: · Will this meeting assist you in achieving your goals?· How does the purpose of the meeting align with the company's strategic priorities?· What contribution can you make in the meeting?· Will anyone even notice if you are not present?· Will this meeting be energizing, or will it suck the life right out of you?· Will this meeting be a rehash of the last five meetings you attended?· Is attending this meeting the highest and best use of your time right now?If you answer no to one of these questions, decline the meeting. Every time you say yes to one thing, you are saying no to something else. Day 2: Clear the mental clutter. Do a brain dump.Mental clutter -- that incessant voice in your head reminding you of things to do, emails to respond to and meetings to schedule -- is stealing some of your joy. It is hard to be joyful when you are constantly being pulled away from the present moment. Clear the mental clutter by doing a brain dump. Think about everything you need to do, personally and professionally. Imagine turning your brain upside down and emptying out its contents onto paper, a whiteboard, or into the computer program of your choice. The goal is to get all the to-dos and ideas out of your head and into the physical world. Once your to-dos are in the physical world your mind is free to think about things, not of things -- exactly what it was intended for. As your mind begins to quiet you will find yourself able to be a little more present and to notice the simple pleasures in your life -- those simple pleasures that make you smile and bring you joy. Clear the mental clutter and reclaim your joy. Day 3: Create a ""stop doing"" list.As your responsibilities continue to expand at work and in life, you keep adding tasks and projects to your to do list. However, as that list grows, you'll notice something -- you're never taking anything off of the list, and THAT is the antithesis of joy. Take a hard, critical look at your projects and tasks and ask yourself if each project is still relevant. Are the tasks directly tied to your goals or your organization's goals? There are probably a few tasks and projects lurking on your list that need to be moved to the stop doing list. No one is going to miss them. Remove the things are no longer relevant, aligned to your goals and are creating unnecessary stress and anxiety. Create space for the things that bring you joy. Day 4: Get into a work flow -- batch like tasks.Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi described flow as a mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement and enjoyment in the process of the activity. And he asserted that a hallmark of flow is a feeling of joy while performing a task. To get into flow, batch or group like tasks. For example, group all of your phone calls together, email correspondence, data analysis, or writing. When you perform the same type of task it is easier for you to concentrate and fully immerse yourself in what you are doing. Day 5: Stop Shoulding all Over Yourself and Use Your P.O.W.E.R. The shoulds are those voices in your head -- you know the ones -- saying ""You should be doing this,"" ""You should like that,"" ""You should spend time on this,"" ""You should stop doing that,"" and so on and so forth -- endlessly. The problem with the shoulds is that they can easily become a runaway train, robbing you of joy and completely undermining your ability to get clear and focused on what you need. To combat the shoulds, use the P.O.W.E. R. No.Here's how to use it: Priorities: When that voice in your head tells you that should complete this task, lead another project, attend another meeting, or make cupcakes from scratch, evaluate the priority of that message. How does this ""should"" align to your priorities, the company's strategic priorities and/or your families' priorities?Opportunities: Explore the opportunities. What opportunities does this ""should"" create for you? Is there something that does actually need additional attention in your life? This 'should' could be shining a light on something that you need to address.  Who: Who or what triggered this ""should""? Was it an old script from childhood? Was it an ad in a magazine? Was it your colleague?Expectations: Whose expectations are these really? Your manager? Your mother? Your spouse? Your child? Society's? Real: Get real. What is this ""should"" really about? Are there real priorities that are driving this ""should""? Or are you taking on societal expectations that are not in alignment with your priorities?The P.O.W.E.R. No enables you to think carefully and critically about all of the shoulds so that you can consciously and thoughtfully respond. Just say no and stop shoulding all over yourself. Your joy filled life is waiting.Day 6: Work in vacation mode and stop extending your day.Long days that never seem to end are not part of the recipe for a joy filled life. It is time to work in vacation mode and stop extending your days. Have you ever noticed what happens before a vacation? Your inbox is magically cleaned out, projects are wrapped up, and your desk is cleared off. I call this the vacation phenomenon. The vacation is a hard deadline. As a result, you have to get the work done before you go. Consider working in vacation mode even if you are not going on a vacation by creating hard stops to your work day. For example, schedule a fun activity after work that has a hard start time -- a movie, a play or a sporting event. The scheduled activity will force you to stop working and you will be more effective throughout your day because you know you cannot keep working until all hours of the night. Or, if you are ready to take it up a notch, schedule a date with yourself to just do something fun, which is exactly what my client did on a Friday afternoon when she left at 5:00 p.m. to finish watching the end of season two of her new favorite show on Netflix. Day 7: Personalize your productivity tools and stop accepting one-size-fits all solutions.One-size-fits all t-shirts never fit properly. The same applies to one-size-fits-all approaches to personal productivity. Maybe you have tried to use a calendar tool you received in a time-management workshop or those colored post-it notes that a friend recommended. If the results were disappointing, the fault is not yours -- it's the fault of tools and techniques that do not match your Productivity Style. So instead of fighting against your natural thinking, learning, and communicating preferences, work with them. Identify your Productivity Style and then embrace it. Use your understanding to guide the choices you make to manage your attention, invest your time, get work done, tame your inbox, and design your work space in ways that are customized for you -- not for someone else. Day 8: Decide what is good enough and stop. Perfectionism is often helpful in my line of work. However, too much of it deprives me of joy because I spend so much time overanalyzing and overdoing that I am never really in the present moment, which is where I can find joy. Do you know what good enough is for each of the projects on your list? This is good enough for the organization and good enough for you. And if you have any doubts, ask a colleague, friend or significant other for their insights to keep you from falling into the trap of perfectionism. Overthinking, over editing and over tweaking wastes valuable time and is not necessary. Do good work, and then stop.Day 9: Focus on the Real work that is aligned to your goals and makes you happyThere is work -- the routine, time-filling work most of us spend our days performing -- and then there is your real work, the work that takes you one step closer to achieving your goals and bringing you joy. Reshape your task list to focus on the real work. First, examine your assumptions. Where are you letting assumptions guide your decision-making process about the work that needs to be completed? Are assumptions -- that may be false, misleading, or unsupported -- getting in the way of you completing the work that is aligned with your personal goals? Assumptions hijack your joy by keeping you trapped in the busy work cycle.Then ask, ""What do I need to start doing? What projects and tasks need to be added to my to-do list that will enable me to achieve my goals and bring me joy?"" Put them on the list. Leave the busy work to someone else, someone who does not want your joy filled life. Focus on the real work that you are meant to do.Day 10: Bring back recess! Go play!Stuart Brown, a psychiatrist and founder of the National Institute of Play, says that play is what keeps our brains flexible and is what enables us to innovate, create and solve problems in new ways. And, in his ""play histories"" he has found that people who do not make time for play - in either attitude or activity -- are often joyless, rigid, have diminished curiosity and, at the core are depressed. It is time to bring back recess and go play! What did you enjoy doing as a child? Think, how did you spend those long summer days that seemed to stretch on forever? Now, disconnect play from any purpose. The true measure of play is how it feels, not what it produces. Lighten it up and lose yourself, even for two minutes, in the joy of play.Dads, in the midst of your busy, hectic and frenzied lives there are flashes of joy -- a smile on the face of your child, landing a new client, laughing over an IPA with your friends, acknowledgement from your boss of a job well done or finally making it all the way through a CrossFit class. And it is in these moments that you experience a lightness of being, a rejoicing, and a delight that emanates to your very soul reminding you that life is more than an crammed schedule, bulging inbox, and never ending to do list.

Take the test now. By Amy Schlinger, SELF A regular workout routine is important for your body--but not if it's keeping you from seeing results. ""Your body eventually adapts to the training requirements and demands placed on it,"" says Faheem Mujahid, owner of Influence Atelier training facility in Miami, FL. Wondering if you're suffering from workout fatigue? Mujahid shares some signs that it's time to start mixing things up--starting right now.1. You're breezing through reps without putting in much effort.""If a client is continuously training at the same level, your brain already prepares the body for that load,"" says Mujahid. Therefore, your muscles won't be as stressed, and you'll hit a veritable pleateau when it comes to improvement. By changing things up (grabbing heavier weights, playing with tempo, doing a more challenging variation of a move), you'll keep that stress load constant and will continue to see changes. 2. You're still running three miles in 30 minutes (or whatever your pace may be).Are you generally running at a consistent intensity, distance or frequency without increasing or changing one of those variables? It's time to kick things into high gear, says Mujahid. That could mean it's time to start adding in speed drills or just ramping up your mileage a few days a week.3. Your legs feel strong--but your arms feel weak.That 7 A.M. Spin class is doing wonders for your butt and legs, but you're still struggling to do a regular push-up. If that sounds like you, you need to add more variety and cross-training sessions to your workout regime. Look at a week's worth of your workouts and ask yourself: are you hitting every muscle group and are you logging cardiovascular, strength, agility and flexibility sessions? If you are that Spin junkie, think about trying a yoga or CrossFit class once a week to target your arms, chest and shoulders, too.4. You no longer feel breathless during your usual HIIT workout.Once your body is used to the same routine, ""it doesn't need to expend as much energy anymore, so it conserves energy,"" making you less tired, says Mujahid. You'll notice less post-workout fatigue or soreness, too, which means you're not gonna see change. And you won't burn as many cals--part of why you're doing a high-intensity workout in the first place, right?5. You can sing along to all the words of your favorite song while working out.No, we're not talking about belting out some Taylor Swift in your head. ""If you can sing out loud while exercising, you're only working out at a moderate-intensity level, max,"" explains Mujahid. So push yourself and pick up the pace or cut the length of your recovery intervals during your next sweat session.Guarantee you'll be feeling the burn again really soon.More from SELF: 20 Superfoods for Weight Loss 10 Ways to Guarantee You Get Up for That A.M.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ff4d3c000020010e04ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The growing social movement advocating for domestic workers and Care.com, which calls itself the world's largest online care marketplace, will announce a new partnership Wednesday afternoon at the Clinton Global Initiative America conference in Denver.The collaboration, called the Fair Care Pledge, joins the website, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and Hand in Hand, a network of domestic employers. The alliance is an “exemplary approach to addressing critical domestic challenges,"" according to the Clinton initiative, an offshoot of the foundation founded by former President Bill Clinton in 2005. Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea Clinton, are serving as the conference hosts. According to a press release on the announcement, Care.com will promote the pledge by inviting hundreds of thousands of its members to affirm that they will make an effort to be fair and respectful when they hire a provider to work in their home cleaning or caring for children or seniors. The pledge asks families to commit to fair pay, clear expectations and paid time off for their care providers. “We believe that care jobs will be the jobs of the future. It’s in all of our interest to ensure that the quality of these jobs reflects the value and importance of the work,"" Ai-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, said in a press release. ""Fairness and quality care go hand-in-hand and we’re thrilled to be able to work with with Care.com to promote these values."" Poo has been a leading advocate for re-conceptualizing domestic work. The United States appears unprepared for an impending crisis as the ""Baby Boomer"" generation ages. Twenty-seven million Americans will need some form of long-term care by 2050. “As a member of the ‘sandwich generation,’ I’ve relied on a slew of caregivers to help me juggle caretaking of my mother during her decline from Alzheimer's, caring for my two daughters and pursuing my legal career,"" Julie Kay, a Hand in Hand leader, said in the release. ""While I’m so appreciative of the work these women do, many times I've asked myself whether I was doing right by them. The Fair Care Pledge provides me with guidance, information, and the assurance I’ve been looking for."" The domestic worker industry has traditionally been difficult to organize and advocate for, given the isolating nature of the work. Ninety-five percent of domestic workers are women, and nearly half are immigrants. Because domestic workers are excluded from many protections guaranteed by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act,  many in the industry are paid below the minimum wage and are denied overtime, sick pay and vacation pay. The Department of Labor released regulations in 2013 that would cover some home health care workers under those federal minimum wage and overtime compensation laws. But a lawsuit filed by home care companies has tied up those regulations. Care.com members and pledge-takers will be able to display an online badge on their profile allowing care providers to know they're ""fair employers,"" according to the press release. “Just as care impacts families, enterprise, policy and government in various ways, so must all those groups be involved in the solution,” said Sheila Lirio Marcelo, the founder, chairwoman and CEO of Care.com. “One key to driving real change is the professionalization of the caregiver industry. We believe it’s critical to attract and retain skilled caregivers. Families who employ full-time domestic workers should pay fair and legal wages, and provide vacation, overtime, and other critical protections that every professional deserves.” The groups' partnership comes as debates about gender and workplace standards are gaining increased scrutiny. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who is not at this year's CGI conference, has advocated for Democratic Party-backed legislation that would promote gender parity in pay. Clinton has also spoken about how the United States is one of just three countries to not require paid maternity leave for new parents. "
