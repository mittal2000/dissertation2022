0,POLITICS,More Americans Would Take A Pay Cut For A Day Off,Arthur Delaney and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/overemployment-poll_us_55bbbe78e4b0d4f33a02bdb0,"""Our workplaces are still not designed for people to get the hours they prefer.""",2015-08-01,"<p>Democratic presidential candidate <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/bernie-sanders"">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) has talked about overworked and underpaid Americans on the campaign trail.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- One in five Americans would trade a day's pay for a day off, according to the latest edition of HuffPost/YouGov's annual poll on the issue.The vast majority of Americans wouldn't mind spending less time at their jobs -- 76 percent say they'd work one fewer day per week if they didn't have to sacrifice any income. Twenty percent, though, said they'd be willing to take a proportionate pay cut as well.In other words, 20 percent of Americans favor something like a permanent three-day weekend -- 20 percent less work for 20 percent less pay. That unmet demand for shorter hours is an economic problem economists call overemployment.""Overemployment suggests that people have scarcity of time, are dealing with time pressure and are willing to sacrifice income to deal with that time pressure,"" Lonnie Golden, an economics professor at Penn State Abington who has studied overemployment, told HuffPost in an interview. HuffPost has tracked the overemployment rate for three years. The newest results mark a slight uptick since last year, when Americans were 7 points more likely to dismiss the idea of working less and making less.Golden said he was surprised the overemployment rate ticked up in the poll, but offered two possible explanations.""One is that the economy is getting stronger, the labor market's getting stronger, and there's probably a greater workload if not just hours of work,"" Golden said. ""Two, our workplaces are still not designed for people to get the hours they prefer.""A big reason companies don't cater to workers' time needs is that workers don't have much power. Though the national unemployment rate has fallen to 5.3 percent, wage growth in the second quarter of this year saw its slowest pace on record. ""A lot of employees don't yet have the bargaining leverage to say, 'I'm adjusting downward by 20 percent,'"" Golden said. On the flip side, while just 15 percent of Americans would be willing to work more without extra pay, nearly half said they'd be willing to take on an extra day of work in exchange for a 20 percent raise. That tradeoff was most appealing to those with lower incomes: Fifty-four percent of Americans in households making under $40,000 a year said they would work the extra day, compared to just 37 percent of those making more than $80,000.Golden said the disparity between income groups suggests salaried workers, who aren't paid by the hour, have more to gain from shorter hours than hourly workers, whose best shot at higher incomes comes from more time on the job.HuffPost readers: Would you work 20 percent less for 20 percent less pay if you had the option? Tell us about it -- email arthur@huffingtonpost.com. Please include your phone number if you're willing to be interviewed. The average American workweek stands at 42.5 hours for full-time workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Factoring part-time workers puts the average workweek at 38.6 hours. Shorter hours were the foremost demand of the labor movement up until the Great Depression, which spurred Congress to pass the Fair Labor Standards Act. The landmark law requires employers to pay extra if their workers labor more than 40 hours per week.Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is the only big-time politician to take up the shorter-hours cause of late. ""A hundred years ago workers took to the streets"" to fight for 40 hours, Sanders told HuffPost in June. ""And a hundred years have come and gone, we’ve seen an explosion in technology, we’ve seen an explosion in productivity, we have a great global economy, and what do you have? The vast majority of people are working longer hours for lower wages."" The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted July 24-27 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls' methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling.

Investigators found Gaillard's DNA under Clarke's fingernails, as well as on a condom containing fluid in her car. Police said the suspect's fingerprint was found on a cigar wrapper in the car.Clarke had died at a family-friendly park in Tampa on July 21. Detectives initially reported that the cause of death was blunt force trauma, but revealed this week that she'd been shot in the head and arm.A maintenance worker found Clarke's body on the morning of July 21 in the park at the University Area Community Center.In addition to the DNA and fingerprint evidence, the sheriff's office noted that Gaillard was holding a .22-caliber handgun in one of his Facebook photos. Clarke's wounds, authorities said, were consistent with such a gun.The motive for her death is not unclear.After the shooting, Gaillard allegedly went to a friend's house and said, ""I think I killed somebody."" He then sold his gun to the friend for $50, according to police. When deputies confronted him, they found a scratch on his neck, ""consistent with a fight"" and with the discovery of another person's DNA under Clarke's fingernails.Gaillard has been charged with first-degree murder and possession of a firearm by a career criminal. He's being held on $275,000 bail.Clarke was reportedly the 10th transgender woman murdered this year in the United States. Her community mourned her last week, demanding swift action for what many called a hate crime.Meanwhile, her parents and authorities refused to call her by her preferred pronouns. ""We are not going to categorize him as a transgender. We can just tell you he had women's clothing on at the time,"" detective Larry McKinnon told BuzzFeed News. ""What his lifestyle was prior to that we don't know -- whether he was a cross-dresser, we don't know."""

Some families of the victims are demanding further compensation from the airline.Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday that additional Malaysian officials were headed to Reunion to look for more debris and others would go to France.""If the flaperon does belongs to MH370, it is actually in accordance with the drift pattern seen in the southern Indian Ocean. But we do not want to speculate. We will wait for verification from the French authorities,"" he said.Discovery of the debris may finally confirm the plane crashed into the sea after veering off course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, helping to end 16 months of lingering uncertainty for relatives.Investigators believe someone deliberately switched off MH370's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles off course.

Some families of the victims are demanding further compensation from the airline.Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday that additional Malaysian officials were headed to Reunion to look for more debris and others would go to France.""If the flaperon does belongs to MH370, it is actually in accordance with the drift pattern seen in the southern Indian Ocean. But we do not want to speculate. We will wait for verification from the French authorities,"" he said.Discovery of the debris may finally confirm the plane crashed into the sea after veering off course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, helping to end 16 months of lingering uncertainty for relatives.Investigators believe someone deliberately switched off MH370's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles off course.

""We hope and urge both sides to go back to the ceasefire, to commit themselves to the peace process, and to the solution that started in Turkey [in 2012], because at the end of the day, it's stability, security and safety that we need to have on our borders.""Bakir added that while Kurdistan respects Turkey's concerns about PKK actions such as recent attacks on police officers, it does not agree with Ankara's claim that the Kurdish militant organization is as great a threat as the Islamic State, or ISIS. The Turkish government began to directly attack both the Islamic State and the PKK around the same time last week.""ISIS is a problem, a terrorist organization. It's the most brutal terror organization. There is an anti-[ISIS] coalition and we want to be partners in this. We welcome Turkey's participation, but connecting the PKK with the terrorism of ISIS -- we don't believe that [and] it's not the right time to mention this,"" Bakir said. ""Yes, the PKK is a problem. It has to be dealt with. But in a different way.""The minister's comments carry significant weight for two reasons.The first is that the Iraqi Kurds are essential to defeating ISIS in Iraq, so their concerns echo loudly in capitals around the world -- especially in Washington, where the Iraqi Kurds are seen as uniquely reliable partners. Bakir's endorsement of a renewed ceasefire and his warnings about the negative effect the Turkey-PKK conflict is having on his region are therefore likely to be key considerations for policymakers in the U.S.Nearly as important is the fact that the Kurdistan regional government of Iraq has the rare ability to exercise leverage on either side of the Turkey-PKK conflict: with the government in Ankara, which enjoys strong trade ties with Kurdistan, and the exiled PKK leadership, which values its ""guest"" status in Kurdistan's Qandil mountains.Turkey's strikes in the mountain range have led to internal displacement and injuries among Kurdistan residents, Bakir noted. The region is already home to 1.8 million refugees, from Syria and from other parts of Iraq, and it has a 1,050-kilometer border with ISIS, which it spends significant resources defending. Turkey's move, which U.S. officials have said they respect as vital for Turkish self-defense, also threatens the ISIS fight in a different way, among an entirely separate group of Kurds -- those in Syria. The Syrian Kurds, the group that defended Kobani with air support from the anti-ISIS coalition, are closely linked to the PKK. While Turkey has said it does not intend to target them in its new campaign, its actions complicate the nascent partnership between Washington and the Syrian Kurds.Iraqi Kurdistan was only notified about Turkey's decision after it was made, Bakir told the reporters. He said his government had raised its disapproval of Ankara's new military campaign with the Turkish government. ""We are caught in between two sides. Both sides decided that there is no ceasefire, that's why we are caught in between,"" Bakir continued. ""We neither agree with the PKK [decision] to announce that the ceasefire is over, nor do we agree on the Kurdistan region to be bombarded, because this is not the solution -- it only escalates the tension and it leads to more violence."" ""The Middle East region is already volatile and full of uncertainties and tensions. We would like to see less and less tension."""

But you can dry your tears, because a researcher monitoring the pride confirmed to Reuters that Jericho is alive and well. It all started on Facebook. “It is with huge disgust and sadness that we have just been informed that Jericho, Cecil’s brother has been killed at 4pm today,” the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force said in a statement. “We are absolutely heart broken,” the group added. Johnny Rodrigues, head of the task force, told CNN that Jericho was “gunned down” by an illegal poacher. “I’m very gutted, I’m very disappointed, I’m heartbroken. It’s just too much,” he told USA Today. Rodrigues can rest easy. “He looks alive and well to me as far as I can tell,” said Brent Stapelkamp, a field researcher for the Hwange Lion Research Project, which is monitoring the lion with a GPS tag.Stapelkamp said readings from Jericho’s tag indicated he was moving around as usual and appeared to be with a female.“When I heard that report, I had a look on the computer and his movements look regular. He sent a GPS point from his collar from 8:06 p.m. Everything looks fine,” Stapelkamp told Reuters.Officials were investigating if another lion had been killed around the time Cecil was shot dead, the Telegraph reported. An unidentified foreign hunter killed the second lion illegally on July 3, a park official told Reuters.Jericho is not Cecil’s brother by blood, but the two males worked together to hold territory.Cecil (pictured above) was illegally killed earlier this month by an American dentist with an affinity for big game hunting. The incident sparked an outpouring of public grief, and demands for the dentist’s extradition and punishment. The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misidentified Jericho as Cecil’s brother. The two males are not related by blood."

Preempting the social scientists of the 20th century, he brilliantly discussed the importance of vast ""impersonal forces'' -- the complex interaction of socio-cultural, politico-economic, and ecological factors -- that undergird the very canvass upon which ambitious men and women jostle to leave a lasting mark. For every Tolstoy, however, there is a Shakespeare and Voltaire, who will preach the undeniable impact of human agency: That is to say, the intended and unintended consequences of individuals' actions on their broader social milieu. History is filled with parables and tales of great kings and statesmen. Now and then, visionary leaders emerge out of nowhere, audaciously taking on the status quo and ushering in a new era for their peoples. Yet, more often than not (think of Jon Snow in Game of Thrones) forward-looking people are the ultimate victim of (misplaced) criticism, mortal envy, cynicism, and bitter animosity of those who either have an interest in preserving the existing system, or fail the see beyond their narrow horizons. In short, a genuine reformer is the primary enemy of the Ancien Régime, which will never cease to discredit, displace, and demoralize its conscientious opponents. Lasting change, and sustainable reform, has a greater chance when it is aligned with the trajectory of broader impersonal forces. Only a symbiotic relationship between structure and agency can provide transformative change. And this is where piecemeal reforms and time-bound visionary leadership are vulnerable to evisceration by the long march of history. After decades of misery and disappointments, the Philippines has finally taken some halting steps in the right direction, thanks to what I call ""Moralpolitik"" -- the injection of ethical leadership into the heart of the national discourse. But as Philippine President Benigno ""NoyNoy"" Aquino warned in his final State of the Nation Address (SONA): ""Everything that we have invested in, everything that we have worked for, will it be gone after just one election?"" With only a single six-year term in office, and equipped with one of the world's weakest states, the question now is whether Aquino's successor will build on his legacy and best practices, or take the country back into the Dark Ages. The Endorsement It finally arrived, that sweet and long-anticipated endorsement for his age-old ally and friend, the Philippines' Interior secretary, Manuel ""Mar"" Roxas, who was already widely considered as Aquino's anointed successor. Caught between Machiavellian calculations (picking the likely winner), on one hand, and demonstration of loyalty and idealism (picking a trusted ally), on the other, Aquino chose to go for the latter. If it is a question of ""winnability"" -- that is to say, preference ratings in latest surveys -- Mar is not the safest bet for Aquino. In survey after survey, Aquino's anointed successor has been lagging far behind Grace Poe (a neophyte senator and daughter of one of the country's most revered movie stars) and Vice President, and long-time mayor of the Philippines' business hub (Makati), Jejomar Binay. Initially, Aquino sought to square the circle by trying to, albeit unsuccessfully, convince Poe to join Mar as his vice presidential candidate. After all, both Poe and Mar boast good educational backgrounds and are largely seen -- quite unique by Filipino standards -- as squeaky clean politicians, who have never (and are unlikely to be ever mired) in corruption-related activities.But given her commanding lead in surveys, thanks to her meteoric rise in recent months, and with her closest competitor struggling with a myriad of corruption-related investigations, the senator has apparently decided to go for the top office. This seems as a very rational decision. After all, there is no guarantee that she will be able to maintain her political capital until the next presidential elections in 2022. Most likely, her team is calculating that it is a ""now-or-never"" situation.Perhaps there is also the dimension of redeeming the injustices of the past, given the tragic demise of her father (Fernando Poe), who is widely believed to have won the 2004 presidential elections, but only to be sabotaged thanks to a concerted campaign of vote-rigging by the then incumbent administration. And then, you have the dimension of political survival and self-preservation. Aquino's predecessors, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Joseph ""Erap"" Estrada, faced corruption-related prosecution either while in office (Estrada) or after they stepped down from office (Arroyo). There is no guarantee that Aquino himself, and his key allies, will not be vulnerable to prosecution for several mishaps or alleged anomalies under his watch. So picking the likely winner in the 2016 presidential elections is a matter of strategic imperative. The Aquino administration, however, is confident that Mar will be able to carry through the day and continue NoyNoy's legacy in office. Arguably, picking Poe would look as too opportunistic, and largely seen as a betrayal of Mar, who, back in 2010, gave way tp NoyNoy as the Liberal Party's (LP) standard-bearer. Aquino was generous in his praise and support during his endorsement speech for Mar. ""We choose the one who is certain to pursue the straight and narrow path,"" declared the incumbent, and ""I believe that person is none other than Mar Roxas."" On paper, Mar looks like a defensible candidate, who will combine NoyNoy's ""good governance"" reforms with technocratic knowledge. NoyNoy 2.0To begin with, Mar can claim that despite being a ""traditional politician"" -- spending more than two decades in the legislature and executive branches -- he has maintained an element of integrity, never succumbing to graft and corruption. This is a very rare characteristic in a patronage-driven, highly corrupt political system. More than anyone, Mar -- as the former trade and industry minister -- was also responsible for establishing the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry, a booming multi-billion-dollar sector, which has fueled growth in the country and provided more than a million well-paying jobs for the Filipino citizens. Thanks to his extensive experience as a venture capitalist in New York, Mar was able to leverage his vast networks (going back to the Wharton days) in order to integrate the Philippines into the burgeoning Information-Technology-driven global growth sectors. Today, the Philippines is a BPO superpower, competing toe-to-toe with giant India.But he seems to lack ""popular touch"", despite (or maybe because of?) hailing from one of the country's most prominent families (Roxas and Arenta). On his mother side, he can count industrialist J. Amado Araneta as an ancestor, while on his father's side, he can count no less than the first post-independence Filipino President Manuel Roxas as his grandfather. His critics have also accused him of mishandling a series of manmade (Siege of Zamboanga) and natural (Yolanda typhoon) disasters. By taking on the position of interior secretary, Mar carried a portfolio that was outside his core expertise (i.e., trade and industry). It was a cabinet position that was responsibility-intensive, but short on resources and capacity. It was a position that provided more of unfavorable spotlight rather than positive PR for him. All publicity is not good publicity in politics, after all. Aquino's endorsement, especially after his popularity ratings bounced back (up by 173%) in recent months, has some advantages. Aquino's core supporters will clearly rally behind Mar, who will also benefit from the political-administrative machinery of the ruling party. But it is doubtful whether it will be a game-changer. Throughout the past three decades, presidential endorsements have rarely changed the dynamics of the elections, which was more determined by popularity, in benign cases, or outright vote-rigging, as allegedly the case in 2004. One could argue that the reason Fidel Ramos was able to win the 1992 elections, despite not winning his own party support, had less to do with Cory Aquino's (NoyNoy's mother) endorsement, than the fact that Ramos himself was hailed as one of the heroes of the 1986 EDSA Revolution against the Marcos dictatorship. So Mar faces an uphill battle in the coming months. One particular risk associated with the likelihood of both Mar and Poe joining the presidential race is the possibility that they will split overlapping constituencies, especially among the middle-to-upper-class voters. Poe, however, also has a strong following among the working class and poor voters -- a constituency that will be even more crucial to her victory with Aquino-backed Mar entering the field. This will clearly provide more room for opposition candidates, making the field particularly fluid, if not risky for Aquino. Ideally, Aquino and his supporters would want to see either Mar or Poe in office, based on the assumption that the two will best carry on the incumbent's best practices and vision of ""good governance"".One thing, however, is certain. The Philippines' politics has become more dynamic, less predictable, and therefore more interesting as we get closer to the fateful 2016 elections. What is at stake is no less than the Philippines' fate as a nation in the 21st century. It is paramount for the next administration to bring about not only clean governance, but also inclusive growth and effective leadership."
