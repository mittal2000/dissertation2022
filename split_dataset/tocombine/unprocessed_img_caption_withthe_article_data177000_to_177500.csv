1,PARENTING,Giving Birth With A Borrowed Womb Is Not What Makes You A Mother,"Lisa Belkin, Contributor
Senior Columnist, The Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/womb-transplant-unethical_us_5b9c5247e4b03a1dcc7dcb07,"There are countless ways to have a baby, and all of them are essentially irrelevant to actually becoming a parent.",2012-09-21,"Rayen Luna Solar, 27, 33-week pregnant, is seen by a midwife in a routine checkup, in Santiago, on July 13, 2012. In Chile 38 percent of the births are carried out by caesarean section --with up to 60 percent in private hospitals-- the third highest rate in Latin America, following Brazil and Mexico, and is the country's most frequent surgery. AFP PHOTO/Claudio Santana (Photo credit should read CLAUDIO SANTANA/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c52471f00005100212c57.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Sweden right now four women are recovering from major surgery -- all part of the search for the ideal of motherhood. The two older of the women are the mothers of the two younger ones. Each daughter has been surgically given the same uterus from which she herself was born -- and from which she hopes to give birth to her own children. The first news reports about this procedure discussed it as a medical triumph, and headlines were dotted with adjectives like ""Pioneering,"" ""Groundbreaking"", and ""Success"". I am here to add another: Troubling. The history of all transplants is one of weighing risk against reward. The risks are many -- there is risk from surgery itself, particularly the anesthesia; from infection and complications after surgery, from years of anti-rejection drugs, all of which have side-effects; from the rejection of the organ if the drugs fail. When deciding to transplant something life-saving, like a heart, liver or lung, the reward, by definition, justifies the risk. When the ""organ"" is a hand or a face, as has been made possible much more recently, the reward becomes quality of life, and while this equation is less clear, ethicists have generally approved this new line. But when the reward is the ability to carry a baby? Is this a value statement we, as a society, really want to make? Arthur Caplan, head of medical ethics at Langone NYU Medical Center thinks not. ""There are dangers here,"" he told me over the phone. ""And too few answers.""Caplan began researching those dangers about a decade ago, after news of a failed uterine transplant in Saudi Arabia, the first attempt in the world. (The uterus had to be removed after 99 days because of circulatory complications.) Caplan, who was then with the Hastings Center, an ethical think tank, was one author on a 2007 report called""Moving the Womb"" that listed the unique questions raised by transplanting this particular organ. In addition to the usual risks of transplant, his report explained, the fact that a uterus is life-giving but not life-saving brings knotty complications. How will families view a child born in such a way -- as that of the donor, or the recipient? In a world that is still struggling with the rights of egg donors, sperm donors, birth parents and gestational surrogates, can we responsibly add uterine donor to that list? What, in turn. are the long-term psychological implications to that child? The long-term health implications? What is the possibility of rupture to a uterus that has undergone a transplant? While advocates have correctly said that the risks here are less daunting because the organ can easily be removed if the transplant fails, what if it contains an embryo or a fetus when that happens? All good questions. But none get at the heart of what I feel is the most important , overarching, unstated but deeply ingrained, problem here -- our essential view of motherhood. The reason a woman would request a transplanted uterus is because she doesn't have one. Of the two Swedish recipients, one lost hers to cancer and the other was born without. Only one half of one percent of infertility in women is caused by a lack of a uterus, which translates to between 2000 and 3000 women in Sweden who might be surgically given one. And why would they want one? To have a baby? No. There are other ways to do that, including gestational surrogacy, through which one can potentially have a biological child. (At least in those states where it is legal and those cultures which allow it.) The real reason for uterine transplants, then, is to grant a mother the experience of carrying and giving birth to a child. Is that worth the risk? To some women -- starting with the two anonymous patients in Sweden -- clearly it is. And how I want to assure them that they are wrong. ""Motherhood and the defining elements of being a mom have been romanticized,"" during this age of technology, Caplan says. ""There is a tendency to expand the definition to include the experience of pregnancy, the naturalness of pregnancy, the non-medicalization of pregnancy."" Uterine transplants, he says, are the end game of the thinking that giving birth is ""an empowering female experience and the defining moment for a mother."" Let's forget for now the irony that giving birth post-transplant is the epitome of medicalized and unnatural, and look instead at the core of the belief that you need to carry a child to mother one. That dismisses the bonds between adoptive parents and children. It also dismisses the role of fathers. And it burdens far too many mothers, in that it takes us one step further along the spectrum that has women feeling ""less-than"" because they had a C-section or asked for an epidural. What technology should be giving us instead is affirmation of the fact that there are countless ways to have a baby, and that all of them are essentially irrelevant to actually becoming a parent. What makes you a mother, a parent, is loving and raising a child. Are birth and pregnancy magical and transformative? Yes. For some people.Are they worth four abdominal surgeries (the two that have already occurred in each donor-recipient pair, the C-section that will be necessary to deliver children from the transplanted uterus, and the one that will eventually remove the organs for good so the recipient need not take immunosuppressants for life)? I don't think so. When we are drawing ethical lines, do we want to cross the one that declares ""it is worth measurable risk to life to accept the skewed definition of a 'real' mother? I hope not. I wish these two women happy pregnancies and healthy children. And I wish we lived in a world where no woman felt defined by how -- and whether -- she gave birth."

But apparently that doesn't apply to credit scores.,2012-09-21,"FILE - In this March 5, 2012 file photo, consumer credit cards are posed in North Andover, Mass. The rate of severely late credit card payments dipped nationally in the first three months of the year, even as banks issued more cards to borrowers with less-than-stellar credit, according to an analysis by credit reporting agency TransUnion. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c50c12500003600360474.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Matt BrownellThey say everything is bigger in Texas. But apparently that doesn't apply to credit scores.Credit reporting bureau Experian released its annual State of Credit report, which examines various statistics related to personal credit on both a national and local level. That includes ranking America's cities by credit score, and once again many towns in Texas brought up the rear. Three cities in Texas -- El Paso, Corpus Christi and Harlingen -- appeared in the bottom 10, with Harlingen ranking dead last in the 143-city ranking. The rankings were done using the VantageScore, which ranges from 501-990. Your Credit Report Card can give you an idea of where your credit score stands in comparison to the worst cities.Rod Griffin, Experian's director of public education (and a Texas resident himself), says there's nothing wrong with Texas -- rather, the cities in question are simply struggling economically, which tends to correlate with lower credit scores.""Where we're seeing higher unemployment and lower income, we're also seeing poor credit scores,"" he says. ""The South Texas area is struggling."" Indeed, Harlingen and El Paso have unemployment rates worse than the national average, and Jackson, Miss., which ranks second to last, is dealing with an unemployment rate of 10 percent. Every one of the bottom 10 cities can be found in the southern states, while the midwest accounted for eight of the top 10 best-scoring cities.Of course, once you've hit bottom there's nowhere to go but up, and that's exactly what many of the bottom-ranked cities are doing. Harlingen's average credit score of 688 is actually a 0.27 percent improvement over last year's score, and Corpus Christi's 706 is a 0.55 percent improvement.In fact, the country as a whole is improving in its ability to manage its debt, albeit slowly. The average American credit score this year is 749, a modest 0.07 percent improvement over last year. That improvement comes despite the fact that Americans are taking on more personal debt than before, with the average person holding $24,890 in debt, an increase of 1.4 percent over 2011. That credit scores should improve even as debt load increases is explained by another key indicator: the average number of late payments, which fell nearly 2 percent this year.""Paying bills on time is the key factor [in the score],"" says Griffin. ""The fact that people appear to be able to make their payments on time suggests that they have better control of the debts they have. And the fact that they're increasing their debt load suggests they may have additional disposable income and are able to take on a little more debt.""There is indeed a clear correlation between a city's average credit score and how well it does in paying off its debts in time. In Minneapolis, the top-ranked city with an outstanding 787 average score, the average person has just 0.25 late payments per year; by contrast, the average person in Corpus Christi has 0.9 late payments in a given year, the worst average in the nation.The key takeaway? If you want a good credit score, be more like a midwesterner and pay your bills on time.The bottom 10 cities by average credit score:10. Savannah, Ga. 7139. Memphis, Tenn. 7118.

3,DIVORCE,Five Post Divorce Financial Tips,"Nancy Van Tine, Contributor

Sometimes though, we overlook the other, more logistical challenges of splitting up.",2012-09-21,Young woman with a piggy bank and using a calculator,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c4f8c240000300094a043.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Everyone knows how devastating, frustrating and emotionally difficult divorce is. Sometimes though, we overlook the other, more logistical challenges of splitting up. Divorce represents a major change in nearly every aspect of life, including your financial stability and future goals. Taking control of your finances is one of the first steps to a fresh start. Here are five simple things that everyone needs to do post-divorce.1. Get organized. Creating a master list of everything required by your agreement or judgment is incredibly beneficial. Most of the mandated actions are time sensitive, including transferring titles, deeding property, paying your ex and even exchanging personal belongings. Review your list and make a calendar so you know when to expect or make payments. Some of the required transactions can be made through direct deposit or payroll deduction, which can really lighten the load. Who wants to make multiple trips to the bank that will only remind you of your divorce?2. Speaking of accounting, it's critical to make sure that joint accounts for banking and credit cards are closed. I stress the latter because I've seen many clients forget about credit cards. Often they weren't using the card during the relationship, didn't think to check on activity and ended up with negatively impacted credit. Remember to remove your name from any joint credit card accounts if your spouse is going to continue using the account. Run your card through the shredder and write to the company managing the account to tell them you are no longer responsible for any charges (I would recommend using certified mail with a return receipt requested).Also, be sure to close all joint bank accounts. If a joint account remains open, your ex can deposit and cash any checks made payable to you, or to both of you. I have seen too many IRS refund checks disappear this way. 3. Immediately after a divorce, it's important that you work with your lawyer to draft a new will. You should also change your health care proxy and durable power of attorney. No matter your situation, I'm guessing you don't want to leave your ex in charge of life-altering health decisions. You should also change any asset that contains a beneficiary component -- life insurance is the big one, but homeowners insurance may qualify as well -- to reflect your new status.4. On the other hand, there are post-divorce benefits that can be easily maintained thanks to COBRA. However, these have time frames that are set firmly in stone. To maximize efficiency, status changes should be done through the human resources department of the employer handling the insurance. Managing this step promptly can ensure that you -- or your ex -- are able to keep receiving benefits.5. Although not everyone does so, changing your name when you marry means that you may want to take back your prior to marriage name when you divorce. This can create a lot of paperwork. If you decide to change your name post-divorce, your driver's license and Social Security cards will need to be amended, as will any bank, retirement and credit card accounts to represent your return to your prior name.Divorce is an ending, but it is also a new beginning. As with any journey, make sure you enter with a good roadmap."
4,STYLE & BEAUTY,Old Hat: Broker's Gin and the Fate of the Bowler,"Christian Chensvold, Contributor
Style Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bowler-hat_us_5b9c51a4e4b03a1dcc7dc7a7,"Summer comes to an official end today, and with it the close of gin-and-tonic season, for as the leaves turn from light to dark, so does our liquor.",2012-09-21,2012-09-21-Martin_and_Andy_tipping_their_hats_cropped.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-09-21-Martin_and_Andy_tipping_their_hats_cropped.jpg,"Summer comes to an official end today, and with it the close of gin-and-tonic season, for as the leaves turn from light to dark, so does our liquor. My souvenir from summer 2012 is an embarrassingly large collection of bowler hats betraying something between complete brand devotion and acute dipsomania. The hats are not woolen and wearable, but small plastic replicas that come atop bottles of Broker's Gin. Based in Surrey and founded in 2000 by brothers Martin and Andy Dawson, Broker's Gin is now the fastest-selling gin in the U.S., with a 2011 sales increase of 44 percent over the previous year. It's easy to see why: Broker's mixes well with tonic, is reasonably priced and who can refuse the best-dressed bottle on the shelf (though Broker's needs to come up with a lopsided insert so the hats rest on the bottles at a jauntier angle). There was a time when the bowler (also known as a derby) was synonymous with London, worn by gentleman and pickpocket alike. It was devised in 1849 and reigned supreme at the turn of the century. Along with other boulevardier accessories like gloves, watch chains and walking sticks, the bowler gradually fell out of favor in the 20th century, replaced first by the floppy fedora, and then by nothing at all. By the early '60s it had long joined the top hat in the mausoleum of gentlemanly headgear. Patrick Macnee as Jonathan Steed in the '60s TV series ""The Avengers"" wears one, the perfect complement to his antiquated Bentley town cars. Martin and Andy Dawson chose the bowler as an instantly recognizable symbol of Englishness, and they don the hats, along with rolled brollies, as part of a sort of PR costume. A rather ignominious fate for this former prince of gentlemanly headwear, but it's almost impossible to wear any hat seriously these days. Though Broker's Gin has adopted the bowler as the symbol of the London stockbroker, the hat was once popular throughout the civilized world -- and even in the barbaric boondocks. The bowler, not the cowboy hat, was the real chapeau of the Old West. It was ""the hat that won the West"" according to Lucius Beebe, donned, in a pop culture example, by Marty McFly's great-grandfather, a simple farming man, in the 1880s set of ""Back To The Future III."" Although he's held several new-media jobs at major corporations, San Franciscan Michael Mattis not-so-secretly longs for the Barbary Coast days of gold mining and the Union Pacific Railroad. He's not only one of those rare men who owns a bowler, he actually wears it. ""I decided I wanted a bowler,"" Mattis tells me, ""after reading Lucius Beebe's comments on the iconic 'coke hat' or 'billycock' worn by just about everyone in the Old West, from locomotive engineers to Montgomery Street bankers. I didn't know where I would wear it; I just wanted one.""Mattis' initial search turned up cheap costume props aimed at the small but perennial Bob Fosse market. So he decided to seek out the real deal and spent $275 online for a hat by Christy's of London. In a sartorial equivalent of ""Field of Dreams,"" in which ""If you buy it, the occasions will come,"" Mattis soon found places around San Francisco to go bowling for hollers. ""I wore it to Royal Wedding and Jubilee parties this year,"" he says, ""and to high tea at the Palace Hotel."" Mattis also wears the bowler as part of his uniform of sorts for meetings of The Ancient And Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus, the mock-fraternal organization with Gold Rush roots that counted Mark Twain as a member. So far ridicule has been miniscule. ""The reaction is universally positive and it is almost always remarked upon,"" says Mattis. ""At the Palace Hotel I merely held it in my hand and people gave me compliments and asked where I'd gotten it. I was disappointed to learn, though, that while Christy's is ""By Appointment"" to the royals, the finest bowlers are actually made by Locke and Co.""It just occurred to me that years ago I actually donned a bowler for an Edwardian costume party. I recall feeling like I looked like Stan Laurel. Perhaps this one-time everyman's had really doesn't suit every man at all. In that case, in the Darwinian world of male accoutrements, the bowler deserved its demise, much more than, say, the panama, which continues to survive, albeit as an endangered species.But with men like Mattis and Broker's status as the hottest-selling gin -- not to mention regular revivals of ""All That Jazz"" -- the bowler continues to haunt avenues, theatrical stages and clandestine meetings like a kind of zombie relic, not quite alive, though yet not fully dead."

After sporting a wedding ring for what seems like eternity, you may feel naked, vulnerable and alone. You're lost and you don't know exactly who you are without your ex partner.The most important thing is not to crumble and despair. Prepare yourself for the dating world by working on personal development, joining a gym, or if you work out regularly, try a different type of workout like yoga or bar pilates. You could also try a detox like going raw for a week or doing a juice cleanse -- even a high protein diet. Whatever you decide to do, make sure its completely different from your usual habits so your body will feel the change. These small changes will make you feel great about yourself, which in turn will give you the confidence to get out into the dating world again after divorce.It's important to feel your best. Don't go into the dating world again until you feel completely comfortable in your body. If you feel that you need to lose 10 pounds, buy clothes that don't make you look like a suburban frump. Get a haircut that doesn't look like something from the 80's before you hit the town. If you feel confident, the opposite sex will be attracted to your energy and you will meet the right kind of people.Many people over 30 feel that they can't meet people like they used to when they were younger and they use this as an excuse to go into isolation. However, this could not be further from the truth! The only advantage twenty somethings have is that they might go clubbing more frequently. Realistically though, not many couples develop in a crowded, dark, loud room full of people looking to get wasted and find a partner for the night. In many ways, you actually have more of an advantage now that you're older. Your social calendar probably consists of intimate dinner parties or professional events. These types of situations are perfect for getting to know people! If you have gone into complete isolation and don't participate in any social outings, never underestimate the power of friends. Ask one of your friends to bring you along to their Christmas party or work function -- even ask if they know anyone to set you up with!Just remember you are not alone; over 50 percent of marriages end in divorce, by some estimates.My number one tip when meeting new people is to always speak highly of your ex partner. I don't mean that you should go on and on about what a wonderful companion they were -- just keep it simple. A gracious comment such as, ""we decided to go our separate ways as we had grown apart"" is a perfect response for why your marriage went south. Even if your ex partner cheated on you or you broke up because of his or her anger management issues, revealing these too early will have a negative effect on your social life. Even if you are itching to spill the great depths of your relationship after a few glasses of wine, hold your tongue. This will become easier as time goes on, and you potential new partner will be certainly be impressed that you've been through so much but still managed to be diplomatic when speaking about your ex. This is particularly important if you have children with your ex, as he or she could be a large part of your new partner's life should you settle down together.If you follow these tips and keep your head up, you will be on the fast track to the fabulous new life that awaits you."
