He seeks to replace policies that have failed to achieve America's objectives. The President has directly taken on the powerful yet waning domestic and Congressional opposition to changing the bankrupt strategies. Though as he presses forward to improve Cuban relations and to conclude an historic agreement that would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, he realizes he will need Congressional cooperation in the future to complete the deals.U.S. security interests in reaching new understandings with these two traditional ""enemies"" differ widely. The President noted in his recent NPR interview, ""while Cuba is a relatively tiny country"" that poses little threat to the U.S., Iran ""is a large, sophisticated country that has a track record of state-sponsored terrorism, and that we know was attempting to build at least the component parts that would be required to develop a nuclear weapon."" With Iran, the President added, ""there's a lot of history -- that's different from the history between us and Cuba.""With Cuba, the President kicked the habit of hostile actions and embargoes that cut off the Cuban people, that had become an embarrassing, outdated Cold War U.S. legacy, and that had been spectacularly unsuccessful in achieving U.S. objectives. Perpetuating the same old policies enshrined Castro as a martyr to ""American imperialism,"" and enabled him to exercise firm control over the Cuban nation. And the U.S. has already had direct contacts with Cuban leaders and people for decades, as American diplomats in our ""U.S. Interest Section"" in Havana have operated a proto-American Embassy since 1977. Americans and Cubans know how to talk to one another. Even though the U.S. waited too long, President Obama has chosen a propitious moment to renew diplomatic relations. Americans have become weary of the old ways. Cuba's struggling economy is losing life support, dependent as it is on deeply troubled Venezuela. The Castros will cede control in 2018 to a new -- albeit communist -- generation that may prefer the Vietnamese to the U.S. development model. Tensions and problems will remain, but the U.S. will now have a better chance to play a more constructive role in Cuba's desperate need for change.With Iran, the President faces far larger challenges. Eliminating the decades-long policies of coercion and sanctions depends on substantial change in Iran's actions and policies. Iran has been perceived as a threat to U.S. security interests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Distrust has virtually excluded official contact and made unlikely any official U.S. presence in Iran, particularly in the American Embassy, which stands as a bitter monument to U.S.-Iran relations. The U.S. and Iran will remain far apart culturally, linguistically and geographically, and Iran's leader Ali Khamenei will prefer distance from the ""Great Satan."" Building regular bilateral communications will take years for the U.S. and Iran to work out in the wake of a nuclear agreement. For decades, American presidents have tried to get Iran to the table, using international sanctions and pressure. The Obama administration has been particularly assertive in trying to capitalize on the sanctions to get to talks. The new Iranian President elected in 2013 expressed willingness and the Obama Administration seized the moment to get Iran to agree to verifiable limitations on its nuclear program to assure it will not get a nuclear weapon. In return, the U.S. and others would progressively lift sanctions that would open Iran's economy to the global markets.If Iran does not agree to a comprehensive deal with the U.S., the results could be grave for both parties. Maintaining the same old policies with Cuba would have been foolish and led to missed opportunities, but ""more of the same"" with Iran will work against American interests. The U.S. has brought Iran to the table and is close to concluding a comprehensive nuclear agreement. Failure to achieve one would leave few alternative strategies. A U.S. failure to implement such an internationally supported agreement could lead to a diminished U.S. leadership role in the world, to a reduction of international support for sanctions and restrictions on Iran's nuclear program, and ultimately to war.Success with Cuba and Iran, on the other hand, could lead to improved opportunities for cooperation, to an eventual integration of the Cuban and Iranian people into the world and to a wider application of diplomacy to help meet challenges in the Middle East and Europe, where military force alone has shown it cannot achieve U.S. objectives. How can the President enlist Congress in this new diplomatic strategy, since it will eventually determine the success or failure of these two deals? Only Congress can lift the embargo and sanctions. Presidential leadership skills combined with positive changes over time in Cuba and Iran will impact the public sentiment and Congressional willingness to support new policies toward these adversaries. Americans, who increasingly oppose costly conflict, may come to recognize that the U.S. would be better off with a Cuba and an Iran (without nuclear weapons) as functioning members of the international community. In woeful times ahead, President Obama could turn to Abraham Lincoln, who said that ""Whoever molds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes, or pronounces judicial decisions."" President Obama and his successors will need to develop a ""public sentiment"" that it is time to test the value and limits of diplomacy to resolve some of America's most serious national-security challenges. He is off to a good start.This post is part of a Huffington Post blog series called ""90 Miles: Rethinking the Future of U.S.-Cuba Relations.""

Federal Election Commission. That 5-4 decision cited free speech as the grounds for dismantling restrictions on independent corporate and union expenditures in federal elections.Lanell Williams-Yulee, who ran in 2009 for county court judge in Tampa, objected when Florida's Supreme Court publicly reprimanded her for violating a rule preventing candidates from seeking donations. She argued that the rule violated her free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.Conservatives on the nine-member court appeared to favor her free speech argument. The court's liberals voiced support for the state's right to ensure the judiciary's impartiality.Justice Anthony Kennedy, who said little during the oral argument but is a strong advocate for free speech rights, is likely to be the swing vote. He wrote the court's opinion in the Citizens United case.Some of the conservatives questioned whether other forms of communication that are allowed under the law, including thank-you notes written by candidates to donors, undermined the purpose of the restrictions.""Now why was there any greater damage done by what she did as opposed to what you admit she could have done?"" Justice Samuel Alito asked Barry Richard, Florida's lawyer, about Williams-Yulee's letter.Some of the court's liberals emphasized the government's interest in protecting the impartiality of judges.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg seized upon an admission by Williams-Yulee's lawyer Andrew Pincus that in some cases regulations could be applied to judicial candidates that would be unconstitutional in other contexts.In addressing how lawyers may feel obliged to respond to personal requests from judges, Justice Sonia Sotomayor drew upon her own experience. ""Isn't it inherent in the lawyer-judge context that people are going to say yes?"" she asked.Williams-Yulee had sent a mass-mail campaign fundraising letter asking for donations of up to $500.

The speech is forward looking and usually lays out the President's priorities for the upcoming year.  This year is different from the last few, though. When President Obama speaks on Tuesday, he will be addressing a Republican-led Congress. With 2016 just around the corner, both parties will be looking to make a bold statement. And both will be looking to avoid the dreaded label ""Party of No.""  Let me suggest one area where the two parties should easily find agreement: ending violence against women and girls. Truth is, if politicians can't agree that violence against women -- rape, domestic abuse, so-called ""honor killings"" -- should be eliminated, what can they agree on?  The World Health Organization reports that 35 percent of women around the globe will experience physical or sexual violence. That's more than 1 in every 3 women.  Congress will likely soon reintroduce the International Violence Against Women Act -- marking the bill's fifth introduction. This year, there is room for great optimism. In 2014, the bill garnered more bipartisan support than ever before.  The bill would cement the United States' commitment to rooting out gender-based violence. The U.S. government would codify the Office for Global Women's Issues at the State Department, whose job it is to ensure that women and girls are at the center of all United States' foreign policy. The bill would also require gender-based violence prevention and response integration into U.S. foreign assistance programs, and it would scale up programs that are proven to be effective in reducing and preventing violence against women.  Any member of Congress -- Republican or Democrat -- who considers him- or herself ""pro-woman"" should run as quickly as possible to be an original cosponsor for the bill. And then they should do all they can to see it passes this year.   Violence against women is one of the most urgent issues of our day, a fact that's recognized by American women and men, constituents and voters who want to see a stronger, better world. Last year alone, Women Thrive engaged tens of thousands of activists who urged American policymakers to tackle this issue.  Women around the globe also strive to break free from poverty, employment and economic barriers, obstacles to quality education, and so much more. All too often violence against women and girls exacerbates these problems. Promoting the kinds of smart policy that promotes safety and security for women and girls is about basic fairness and doing the right thing. And it's also about developing a more prosperous and sustainable global community for everyone, women and men.  In my 20-years-long career, I've learned that the key to success -- no matter the endeavor -- is to listen. The best international development initiatives start by listening to women and girls, and the most successful lawmakers are the ones who listen to their constituents.  The Republicans have announced that Iowa Senator Joni Ernst will deliver the party's post-State of the Union response. Will she set a tone of coming together to work on today's biggest issues? Senator Ernst, President Obama, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle: listen to women and say yes to the International Violence Against Women Act."

The California Drought Becomes an Emergency California's multi-year drought grew dire enough in 2014 to prompt Governor Jerry Brown to declare a drought emergency in January. By the end of the year, California had experienced the driest and hottest 36 months in its 119-year instrumental record. Some researchers described the drought as 1) the worst in over 1200 years and 2) evidence of rising temperatures globally as climate changes accelerate. As of mid-January, the drought is continuing. As the California and western drought continued in 2014, storage reservoirs in the region were drawn down to record lows. ""Bathtub rings"" around Lake Mead in 2012. In July 2014, Lake Mead reached the lowest levels since the lake was filled in the 1930s. © J. Carl Ganter/Circle of Blue2. Tigris and Euphrates River Dams Influence Islamic State Expansion Conflicts over water have a long history. In 2014, a new analysis described the links between drought, climate change, water management, and the Syrian civil war. By the end of the year, the region's major dams were targeted for control by the Islamic State (IS) and used as weapons to flood parts of Iraq and to divert water away from some communities for political purposes. IS forces near these dams were also targets of allied air strikes because of the dams' strategic importance.3. U.S.-China Climate Agreement Includes Water-Energy Provisions On November 12, 2014, the President of the United States reached a momentous accord with the President of China to cap greenhouse gas emissions and do a whole lot more for Mother Earth and its human inhabitants. The agreement encourages collaboration between the world's two largest economies to much more quickly put into place new tools, practices, and especially markets to contend with radically different ecological and economic conditions. The agreement includes two provisions to secure freshwater supplies in energy production. The two nations are 1) investing in research to improve efficiency and conservation in water supply for energy generation and 2) developing a carbon-sequestration demonstration project in China to put to good use the water that is displaced from deep beneath the surface during CO2 storage.4. The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act Turns 40 Amid Mounting Safety Lapses  In the year that the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act turned 40, Toledo, Ohio, Charleston, West Virginia, and towns along North Carolina's Dan River were the victims of pollution incidents that highlighted the continued challenges in safeguarding water supplies and protecting public health. Toledo shut down its water supply after poisonous algae toxins developed in Lake Erie. Charleston's water supply was fouled by a chemical spill that prompted the Justice Department to indict the plant's owners for water-quality violations and obstruction of justice. In North Carolina, a storage basin failure at a Duke Energy power plant sent more than 35,000 metric tons of coal ash, a noxious waste product, flowing into the Dan River, a drinking water source. The Safe Drinking Water Act turned 40 in 2014. Major cities (including New York) all test tap water, which is among the best in the world. But incidents of contamination in major cities highlight the need for expanded vigilance and protection against contaminants. © J. Carl Ganter/Circle of Blue5. Evidence of the Link between Climate Change and Extreme Hydrologic Events Grows Stronger The evidence of the links between climate change and extreme hydrologic events grew more powerful in 2014. A series of scientific reports addressed heat waves in Europe, coastal damages in the Eastern United States during extreme tides and storms, flooding in the UK from more intense rain storms, drastic loss of Arctic ice, and droughts in Australia and the Southwestern United States. Lloyd's of London concluded in May that the influence of rising sea levels increased the damages from Hurricane Sandy by $US 8 billion in New York alone. Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city and located close to the water-rich Amazon Basin, suffered its worst drought.6. America Becomes More Water-Efficient as U.S. Water Use Drops Dramatically The United States is using less water nationally - according to the U.S. Geological Survey in a report issued in November. The federal science agency found that water use dropped to 355 billion gallons a day in 2010, the lowest level since 1970. California continues to be a leader in efficiency and conservation. It withdrew 38 billion gallons of water per day in 2010, a 17 percent decrease from 2005, and the lowest tally since 1965. The USGS report updates the last national water supply and use survey, which collected data from 2005, when national water use was 410 billion gallons per day. In effect, a nation of 309 million people in 2010 used as much water as 205 million Americans did 45 years ago. 7. China's South-North Water Transport Canal Opens China turned the spigot on the central line of its South-North Water Transfer Project, sending the first gush of water from Danjiangkou Reservoir along the 1,432-kilometer route to Beijing and other cities in the country's dry North. Together with the transfer project's eastern line, which began operating in December 2013, and a planned western line, the massive diversion will siphon as much as 44.8 billion cubic meters (11.8 trillion gallons) of water each year from the Yangtze River Basin, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. It is the largest project of its kind in the world, with a price tag upwards of $US 81 billion. China - South North Water Transfer project under construction.

Algal Blooms Foul Water Worldwide Decades of research and billions of dollars spent to understand the causes of toxic algae blooms and oxygen-starved aquatic dead zones around the world have produced more scientific knowledge but achieved few results to solve two of the most dangerous threats to the world's oceans and fresh water reserves. In fact, according to a growing body of scientific evidence, algae blooms and near-shore ocean dead zones are growing larger and more numerous while endangering important fisheries and drinking water consumed by millions of people.9. Water-Saving Renewable Energy Technologies Become Mainstream The Energy Information Administration reported that for the first time solar, wind, and geothermal power sources overtook hydropower in 2014 as the largest sources of renewable electricity in the United States. Wind and solar, which typically require little or no water per unit energy produced, also competed with natural gas as the largest new sources of electrical generating capacity in the United States. Through November, half the new generating capacity came from natural gas while solar and wind accounted for 44 percent, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The transition to water-saving renewable energy is accelerating. Less than a decade ago, U.S. hydropower plants accounted for three times as much generation as non-hydro sources. In 2014, said the EIA, wind, solar, and geothermal energy accounted for just over 6.6 percent of U.S. electricity generation and hydropower accounted for just under 6.6 percent. ""By 2040,"" said the EIA, ""nonhydro renewables are projected to provide more than twice as much generation as hydropower.""10. Water Shutoffs in Detroit Are Factor in Largest U.S. Municipal Bankruptcy Thousands of residents of Detroit -- a city under emergency management that is reeling from decades of deindustrialization and neighborhood decay -- were cut off from drinking water supplies last year. Roughly 17,000 residences were shut off between March and August because of overdue bills. Residents pushed back, taking water from fire hydrants to drink, cook, bathe, and flush their toilets, and community leaders organized emergency water deliveries. Meanwhile the accountants, lawyers, and traders collected tens of millions of dollars in fees to complete the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The problem in Detroit raised questions about whether the shutoff of water violates the UN-declared human right to water, which requires delivery of a basic amount of water independent of ability to pay."

That vision included a world free of prejudice, where, in his words, people ""will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."" And that vision went further. Dr. King believed strongly in -- and struggled for -- worker security, economic equality and social justice more generally. Indeed, he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee where he had gone to support sanitation workers who were on strike for decent wages, safer working conditions and the recognition of their union. For weeks before his death, he spent time planning a Poor People's March on Washington.Three years before his assassination, he gave a sermon in the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta Georgia, in which he said:[In the 1963 'I Have a Dream' speech,] I tried to tell the nation about a dream I had. I must confess to you this morning that since that sweltering August afternoon in 1963, my dream has often turned into a nightmare; I've seen it shattered... I've seen my dream shattered because I've been through Appalachia, and I've seen my white brothers along with Negroes living in poverty. And I'm concerned about white poverty as much as I'm concerned about Negro poverty. King believed strongly in the dignity of all of us. He understood the importance of adequate housing, freedom from hunger, full employment rewarded with living wages. As many of us fight today for an increase in the minimum wage, an end to job discrimination, including that based on sexual orientation, full employment, and an end to poverty, we are continuing the struggle for which Dr. King gave his life.My own energy is focused primarily on the fight for an expanded Social Security. Though King never spoke about that program, the values that it embodies are his values and beliefs - that it is our birth right as human beings to have dignity, economic security, that we are all connected, sharing the same risks and benefits. There were many in King's world who sought to divide us. Their spiritual heirs are with us today. In my own area, they tell us that benefits for seniors are harming our children. They tell us that benefits of those with disabilities are harming seniors. They claim that Social Security is unfair to African Americans who, on average, have shorter life expectancies. In our forthcoming book, Social Security Works! Why Social Security Isn't Going Broke and How Expanding It Will Help Us All, my co-author, Eric Kingson, and I explain why none of those charges about Social Security are true. The charge about African Americans is particularly outrageous because those making the charge appear to be doing so simply to undermine confidence is Social Security. To my knowledge, no one making that claim ever proposes universal health care, safer working conditions, or other reforms to improve life expectancy. The reality is that Social Security embodies the truth, understood so well by Dr. King, that we are strongest together. On this anniversary of the birth of Dr. King, let's all pledge to continue his struggle for justice and equality, for economic opportunity and worker security for all. For my part, I will continue to fight to expand Social Security for all generations."

But a recent survey by Pepperdine University finds that a third or more of small businesses aren't doing basic financial analysis.",2015-01-19,2015-01-19-pepperdineppcm2015financialanalysisusage.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-01-19-pepperdineppcm2015financialanalysisusage-thumb.jpg,"Professional athletes spend thousands of hours over their careers watching videotape of themselves and competitors. That's because athletes know reviewing tape of players in action can help improve their performance.Players and their coaches also rely on statistics from previous games to identify and map a plan for addressing opportunities and trouble spots in upcoming matches. In other words, statistics and tapes are critical tools for focusing on the things athletes can control and for being better prepared for the things they cannot.Business owners and top executives can also ""watch their tapes"" and gain insight from their stats in order to increase sales and make more money. But a recent survey by Pepperdine University finds that a third or more of small businesses aren't doing basic financial analysis. In many cases, they're not preparing an annual budget, reviewing key performance indicators or having financial statements audited or reviewed.And while 85 percent of businesses with revenues less than $5 million report having the desire, drive and enthusiasm to grow, only 45 percent say they have the necessary resources (such as people and money) to grow, according to the survey of 682 business owners for the Pepperdine Private Capital Project's 2015 Capital Markets Report. Dawn Fotopulos, author of ""Accounting for the Numberphobic"" and associate professor of business at The King's College in New York, called these statistics ""eye-popping crazy"" for what they imply about how owners manage their businesses. ""Financial statements represent a marriage of what is working in the business and what is not working in the business, and if you don't review your financial statements, you are doing the equivalent of driving a car with your eyes closed,"" she said. ""These businesses don't have the necessary resources because they don't know what they need, because they can't read their financial statements,"" she said. ""So even though they have the enthusiasm to grow, they don't know how.""The best business decisions are always made based on a careful review of future conditions, according to Brian Hamilton, chairman of Sageworks, a financial information company. ""Yet, it is also true that business people need to understand the past in order to be able to make their futures happen,"" he said. ""You cannot run a business without piecing together the results of the past and gaining insight from what has occurred.""Where many business people, even good ones, go astray is that they cannot develop a good framework for future decisions, because they don't even know what is happening now, according to Hamilton. Accountants are among the financial professionals who can play a role here. ""They can help business owners connect what has happened as outlined in financial statements to what the owners want to happen in the future,"" he said.James Zapata, partner at MiddletonRaines+Zapata, a Houston-based accounting firm, said smaller businesses sometimes have people in their organization who are less financially sophisticated, ""so they don't understand the power that financial statements can have internally and from a management perspective in terms of helping to drive and focus on areas that need improvement.""He encourages clients to look at financial statements quarterly, if not monthly. ""It really helps them focus on what the core business is or can be doing,"" he said. Accountants can better help manage the client's tax situation and help them plan for growing the business when the client has financial statements, whether prepared by the client or the accounting firm, Zapata said. Embracing budgets and forecasts also helps entrepreneurs plan better and manage costs, he said.Zapata noted that only 12 percent of the smaller businesses in the Pepperdine survey reported having an outside board of directors, compared with 29 percent of firms with more than $5 million in revenue.""Those are really low numbers,"" he said. ""Having an outside board of directors can be a huge value add but not a huge cost."" Even simply creating a peer group of people outside the organization who can share financial information and advice is beneficial, he said.In the Pepperdine survey, 66 percent of smaller businesses and 86 percent of businesses with more than $5 million in revenues said they review key performance indicators. But Fotopulos said based on her experience talking with business owners, she would bet most owners only examine sales indicators, which provide limited information about how the business is doing.""Most of the people I speak to... have absolutely no idea what's happening with their cash flow, for example; they have absolutely no idea what gross margin is or how to manage it,"" she said. ""They just know that they can't pay their bills and they need to find more customers. But sometimes all they succeed in doing is scaling an unprofitable business."""

Bahah's residence, the Republican palace, was later cut off.""The gunmen have surrounded the palace and the prime minister is inside,"" government spokesman Rajeh Badi said. Two eyewitnesses confirmed the siege.Al-Saqqaf earlier told Reuters the presidential palace had come under ""direct attack"" in what she described as an attempted coup. Hadi was believed to have been at home in another district at the time. ""If you attack the presidential palace ... This is aggressive, of course it is an attempted coup,"" she said.Government ministers said a ceasefire had come into force in the evening after the Houtis had seized the state news agency and television station. Nine people were killed and 90 wounded, Health Minister Riyadh Yassin told state news agency SABA. Final numbers are likely to be higher.Widely seen as Iran's ally in its regional struggle for influence with Saudi Arabia, the Houthis -- now part of Yemen's government -- said they would ""escalate the situation"" if their demands for a fair stake in a new constitution were not met.Yemen has long been plagued by tribal divisions, a separatist challenge in the south and the threat from a regional wing of al Qaeda, which claimed a deadly Jan. 7 attack in Paris on a satirical journal known for mocking Islam. GUNFIRE, EXPLOSIONSIn the early evening, state news agency Saba quoted Interior Minister Jalal al-Roweishan as saying a ceasefire had gone into effect. Residents reported that the intense artillery and gun battles of earlier in the day appeared to have tailed off.But residents were uncertain about the immediate cause of the violence, which began in the early morning with explosions near the palace and the home of the national security chief.Residents said army gunners had shelled a housing compound used as a Houthi base.Heavy gunfire and explosions shook the Hadda district in the diplomatic quarter in Sanaa's south. A Reuters witness saw gunmen in Al-Khamseen street, home to some senior government security officials, including the defense minister.""On my way to work in the morning in Hadda street, there were gunmen swarming everywhere. They were in military fatigues. Their bazookas bore 'Death to America, death to Israel' signs, which is the Houthis' sign,"" said a hotel worker.In a move that stunned the Arab world, the Houtis seized Sanaa in September and advanced into central and western regions of Yemen, where Sunni Muslims predominate. The Houthis want more rights for the country's Zaydi Shi'ite sect and say they are campaigning against corruption. PARTNERSHIPA deal signed later that month between political parties and the Houthis called for the formation of a new unity government followed by the withdrawal of Houthi combatants from the capital. The fighters have remained in place, however.In what he said was an attempt to defuse the violence, Saleh al-Sammad, a Houthi member appointed by Hadi as a political adviser in September, issued a statement with a list of conditions addressed to the government.The conditions include a ""fair"" and inclusive partnership with Ansarallah, the political wing of the Houthi movement, and omitting sections of a draft constitution that he said violated September's political agreement.""If the previous agreement is not honored, there is commitment to escalate the situation ... and it is difficult to undo the escalation, which will come at a big cost,"" he said.The draft, launched on Saturday, aims to resolve regional, political and sectarian differences by devolving authority to the regions, but has been opposed by the Houthis who fear it will dilute their power.
