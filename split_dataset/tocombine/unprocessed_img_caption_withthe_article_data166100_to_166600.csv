(Photo by John Shearer/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cba8e2200005600d95a4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Elizabeth Banks seems to have angered mothers who have ""just"" one child when she said that only after having her second baby did she finally feel like she was ""really a mom."" During an interview with People magazine for the Celebrity Baby Blog section, Banks explained  her surprise at the difference between one and two. “Two is very different from one. When you have one kid, you feel like you can jet set around and you can throw him on the hip and you get your life done,” the actress told People. “You don’t realize how easy one is until you have two. Now I’m really a mom. Oh, I am a mom now! This is for serious — I am responsible for two people now.”Some parenting bloggers saw these as fighting words. ""Before she was really a mom, she was what exactly to her son? A nanny? A partial mom? A ... WHAT?!"" writes CafeMom blogger Julie Ryan Evans. She added that it is insulting to parents of one child, regardless of whether Banks meant it or not. Over on Jezebel, Laura Beck has a different read: ""I don't think she was casting aspersions on the second-class mothers of blighted single babies, I think she was just being funny when talking about the difficulties of two kids."" Yet, if Banks meant what she said, she is far from the first mother to learn that parenting changes with each subsequent child. Some describe the adjustment to the first as far more overwhelming than adjustment to the second. Others, will tell you the opposite. As HuffPost Parents blogger Wendy Widom, who stopped at one child explained in August: With only one, life is easy peasy. I have tons of time for hobbies, travel, adult conversations, impromptu trips to the outlet mall and anything else that suits my fancy. I don't referee little people's spats, wipe up their messes or spend hours coordinating pickups and drop-offs. I get QT with the hubby whenever I want. And my worry level about finances is just about nonexistent. In fact, I'd describe most of my family's days together as relaxing, fun and fulfilling. If you're the mom of more than one kid under 6, can you really say the same? Banks used a gestational surrogate for both her children. And she is on the record as a gushing mother. In November, she wrote about the birth of her second son on her blog, saying: ""This experience has exceeded all expectations, taught us a great deal about generosity and gratitude, and established a relationship that will last a lifetime.""What do you think?

How many times have you encountered a situation where there is a scarcity mentality? Where people ""hang on to"" their pie with a vice-like grip -- as if life will be over if they lose a little of it. The fear of not having enough rules their lives.Do you have a generous spirit? Do you give love generously? And freely -- that's the critical component. It's very rare for someone to actually master unconditional acceptance, let alone love! Can you truly give love to someone and expect nothing in return? Unconditional means to give freely -- with no strings attached, with no expectations of a return or repayment. Are you generous with yourself? Do you take the time to work on your life? To slow down and step back, to learn, grow, develop, see, and deal with the fears that are ruling your life? It's so easy to fall into the trap of rushing. We do everything in a hurry and always feel overwhelmed, although we never seem to accomplish anything. We have no idea how we feel or who we are. That is losing ourselves in our lives.Or do you have a teeny bit of a martyr streak that makes you do stuff for others (in the wrong spirit if you dig deeply enough), fail to set boundaries, and you end up feeling unappreciated and undervalued? Generosity, or the lack of it, plays a huge role in every area of our lives, yet we rarely openly discuss it or explore it -- or teach it specifically to our children! Do you give people the benefit of the doubt?  Do you try to see things form someone else's perspective? Do you give your time -- often the most important quality you have -- freely?  Do you give yourself the time you need to recharge your batteries? Do you give from your heart -- lovingly, with tolerance and patience?Are you fearful of losing anything -- love, possessions, respect? Fear will block the flow of generosity, love and blessings in your life!Being able to receive as well as give! The other half of giving generously is being able to receive! Most of us need to work on both! Very giving people often have a hard time receiving graciously. They feel deep down perhaps they are not worthy of being given anything -- let alone love. Often, our motivation for giving and not receiving is that we don't feel worthy of being loved, and so by trying really hard to get everyone else to love us, maybe it will make us feel better.The flow between giving and receiving is really the flow of love. Do you let others feel the joy of giving to you? Of seeing your face sparkle as you open their gift? It may not be wrapped in paper! Do you lift up other people's spirits with your words and voice tones? Do you focus on what is right and not all the things that are wrong? At the end of the day, the pie is huge! There is more than enough for everyone -- it's like the loaves and the fishes story in the Bible. It might seem like you have little or nothing to start with, but generosity and love makes whatever you have grow and blossom -- and the more you give, the more there is to give! And the more you receive, without expecting it. Remember... you need to give to yourself so you can recharge and keep giving to others! Your missionSo your mission today after reading this is to immediately check the spirit in which you do everything today. Are you being generous -- giving people the benefit of the doubt, assuming the best, and giving time -- to yourself and others? Ask yourself if you are being generous with yourself and your beliefs about yourself. Are they really true, those beliefs you have? Are they yours? Or did they come from someone else in your life when you were little or vulnerable? So many things to explore. Isn't it exciting? Aren't we blessed to have this opportunity? The generosity and love of the spiritual realms is beyond our comprehension, but we can be grateful for it, have compassion for ourselves and others, be hopeful that we can dramatically increase our ""generosity intelligence,"" and have reverence for their patience, guidance and love! And this is just the fifth week of our journey to joy -- it's so much more than just happiness! Zooties  Amanda GoreFor more by Amanda Gore, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

We were married on October 6, and we still haven't done one important thing.",2013-01-16,Professional woman showing concern at work using her laptop,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb19d2100003300c53a45.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My husband and I are the worst. We were married on October 6, and we still haven't mailed thank-you notes.For every other wedding-related event, I had notes out by the following week. I have a creepy craft gene, so I stayed up late painting gold leaf on water color paper, then individually hand-stamping ""Thank You"" on each one.But for the main event, our gratitude is tardy. We went on our honeymoon right after the wedding, and then suddenly it was late October/early November and we had a ton of work and social events on the evenings and weekends. And then, impossibly, we found ourselves in the Thanksgiving-Christmas corridor, and any free time we had was spent cleaning our house (which is under attack by a massive renovation), or being sick, or resting.None of these are good enough reasons to be so late with our thanks. For a while, we would look at our shiny stack of gorgeous cards from Minted and reassure ourselves that we had a whole year to send them out, so a few extra weeks wouldn't make a difference. Turns out everyone else has a whole year to send us a gift, and we have six to 12 weeks to answer back with a card. (Mother-in-law says six weeks, Emily Post says 12, I'm smart enough not to argue with either.)The worst part in all of this is that by procrastinating our thank yous, we appear ungrateful. So many people helped us in so many different ways leading up to the wedding and there were times I couldn't write it all down. I'm scared I will forget to include the actions when I thank people for the tangible gifts they've given. And I'm scared that in the time I've taken trying to remember each favor or errand run or cocktail quietly thrust into my hand mid-reception that our friends and family have narrowed their eyes at us.And we totally deserve it.The only silver lining in this is that by now, we've used all of our gifts. Our thank yous won't just be, ""Thanks for the Le Crueset pot,"" but instead, ""I have probably kept Jim Perdue's grandkids in boarding school based on the amount of chicken I've braised for Raven's games in my amazing Le Crueset."" I can tell the givers of our gorgeous Kate Spade sand piper plates that we keep them separate from our normal dishes and only use them when we've cooked something truly delicious. I can recount the numerous dance parties that have broken out in our kitchen in my thank-you card to our friend who gave us a Jambox. Or I can tell the check-givers that thanks to their generous gifts, we were able to buy the new kitchen cabinets we really wanted, and not the shiny particle board nightmares we had budgeted for.I'm not advocating that you take as long as we have to send out your thank-you notes. I'm just suggesting that if you find yourselves an uncomfortable distance from your wedding with nary a note in the mail, use the opportunity to share how you used your gift. Make the elapsed time work in your favor, but be ready to accept admonishment for your tardiness. No one likes a smug bride with bad time-management skills.And for the record, to everyone who came to our wedding, THANK YOU WE LOVE YOU OUR CARDS ARE COMING WE PROMISE."

They showed no problems with language, communication, social interaction and “facial recognition,"" which can be difficult for individuals with autism.""This is a story that's been around for a long time without very clear validation; the idea that some children could grow up to be adults without autism,"" Dr. Thomas R. Insel, director of the National Institutes of Mental Health told The Huffington Post.The new study, Insel said, carefully tests whether those individuals ever truly had autism and whether they are now functioning like a non-autistic person. ""In both cases,"" he said. ""The answer is 'yes.'""Fein and her colleagues are currently exploring why some children shed their autism diagnosis as they age, relying largely on parents' reports about the treatments they received. The researchers also use brain imaging to see whether their brains have normalized, or if they are somehow compensating for the disorder.“At this point, all I can tell you is from my 40 years of clinical experience,” Fein said. ""All of the kids I have personally seen who have moved off the [autism] spectrum have received some form of behavioral intervention.” Numerous studies have found that behavioral interventions can be effective in improving things like social function and cognition in children with autism, but Fein cautioned that parents should keep the new study in perspective.“This is not a common outcome,” she said. “We don't know what the percent is -- it's almost certainly under 25 percent, and it may be significantly lower than that.” At this point, there is no way to predict which children will ""lose"" an autism diagnosis as they grow up and which children will not.“I don't want people to see this story and say, ‘My goodness! Where have I failed because my child didn’t have an ‘optimal outcome?’"" echoed Insel. “What we're interested in doing is helping parents help their kids grow up to be adults who can really participate in the world -- who can work and have a family and a life -- whether they have the symptoms of autism or not.”"

But the time they spent lying around made no difference.""Our study supports the current physical activity guideline, that's what I want people to know,"" lead author Soyang Kwon, a pediatric researcher at Northwestern University in Chicago, told Reuters Health.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that children and teens exercise at least at the intensity of a fast walk, about 5.6 kilometres per hour (3.5 miles per hour), for 60 minutes every day.Last year, a study in adults found a different result: regular exercise doesn't protect against the dangers of sitting for many hours at desk jobs. This is likely because children are more active than adults overall.""In adults, where the activity levels are generally less, the time spent sedentary may have more of an effect,"" said Russell Pate, who studies physical activity in children at the University of South Carolina in Columbia.Kwon and her coauthors from the University of Iowa used data from a study in that state that followed children of various ages from 2000 to 2009.A group of 277 boys and 277 girls were measured at eight, 11, 13 and 15 years old for body composition and fat content using a precise X-ray technique originally developed to assess bone density.The same children wore an accelerometer, which measures body movement, for several days in a row sometime in the same year.Even among children who exercised the least, the amount of time sitting didn't make much of a difference.For the 13-year-olds, those who sat less than, more than or equal to the average six and a half hours per day all had about the same body fat mass.But boys who spend the least amount of time in moderate to vigorous activity had about 5 kilograms (11 pounds) more body fat on average than those who exercised the most. For 13-year-old girls, the low level exercisers had about 3.2 kg (7 lbs) more body fat than the exercisers.Results were similar in every age group, but the researchers did not record if each child was overweight or not.In a previous study, the same team of researchers found that even light intensity activity, like walking, every day, was linked to lower levels of fat in teens, but not young children.""Parents should encourage their children to be physically active, the more the better,"" said Ulf Ekelund, who studies obesity risk factors in children at the Norwegian School of Sport Science in Oslo. ""That might sound simple, but the execution isn't so simple sometimes.""

""Dieting can be such a serious topic that every once in a while you have to laugh about it, and I wanted to connect with people who might enjoy a laugh or two.""Thanks to the 24/7 social support, connecting with like-minded dieters online really works, researchers from the University of South Carolina's Arnold School of Public Health report in the journal Translational Behavioral Medicine. This is one of the first studies to measure Twitter's direct impact on dieting.More from Everyday Health: Drugmaker Files for U.S. Approval of New Diabetes Drug Early Surgical Menopause Linked to Cognitive Decline Do Allergies Protect Us?In Regnier's case, she says tweeting helped her lose 20 pounds and keep it off since 2010. She's such a fan that she even wrote a book about it, Your Twitter Diet, which shows other people how to drum up weight-loss support online. (She also blogs at DoesThisBlogMakeUsLookFat.com.)""I give help and I get help via the support of Twitter,"" she explains. ""Celebrities have a team of people, and I always say that Twitter can be that for you. Your own army of support when you need it.""Regnier is not the only one who has used Twitter to stay accountable for weight loss. Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri made headlines in 2011 for tweeting her diet and exercise routines. The senator has since lost 50 pounds. New York Times reporter Brian Stelter lost 90 pounds by tweeting every bite in 2010.How Tweeting Helps Weight LossIn the USC study, 96 overweight or obese adults were randomly assigned to either listen to two podcasts per week about nutrition and fitness or to listen to the podcasts, record physical activity, and connect with other study participants on Twitter. At the end of the six-month period, the Twitter users lost more weight — each tweet actually corresponded with half a pound lost, researchers found, suggesting that social networking can be a powerful, accessible tools for dieters.""Traditional behavioral weight loss interventions generally provide social support through weekly, face-to-face group meetings. While we know this is effective, it is costly and can create a high degree of burden on participants,"" said lead researcher Brie Turner-McGrievy, PhD, MS, RD, in a release. ""Providing group support through online social networks can be a low cost way to reach a large number of people who are interested in achieving a healthy weight.""Now that Regnier is at her happy weight, she uses Twitter to communicate her new goals: gaining strength and running longer distances. Plus, she finds it's a good pick-me-up when she slips out of her usual healthy eating routine. ""There's no weight loss 'before and after' for me — I'm always in the 'during' process,"" she says. ""If I slip on my diet one afternoon, people are very sweet to me, and remind me that one afternoon doesn't have to make my whole week.""Ready for your own online support group? Regnier has these tips to help you find the support you need for weight loss success:- State your intention. Publicize your goals on Twitter, Regnier says. It makes them more concrete, and keeps you accountable.- Make Twitter work for you. Whether you choose to tweet everything you eat or only post when you need a little extra support, there are different ways to approach your diet online. It's also important to celebrate your successes on Twitter, Regnier says. ""You'll practice what you preach when you preach it online,"" she says.- Find what you like. Whether you're eating Paleo, training for your first 5K, or counting calories, seek out people and organizations with the same health goals. Bloggers, experts, and organizations with like interests can be great sources for inspiration, support, recipes, workout plans, and more.- Be generous and get involved. Use Twitter search to find conversations and people who are interesting to you, and don't be afraid to jump in. ""When you see something good, share it,"" Regnier says. ""Open yourself up to being generous. It’s like you’re at a dinner party — try to be the person you want to sit next to.""- Don't forget about safety. ""I always caution people that Twitter is social, and it is public,"" Regnier says. ""If you wouldn't say it to your pastor, police, or parents, don't say it online.""- Try other online outlets. Free online nutrition and fitness challenges are everywhere; it's just a matter of finding one that appeals to you. Some websites, such as DietBet.com, allow users to wager real money on their weight-loss efforts if you're looking for a more serious competition.""Tweet Your Way to Weight Loss, Science Says"" originally appeared on Everyday Health."

Several U.S. states are also grappling with record spikes of whooping cough.Federal vaccine guidelines recommend 24 immunizations by age 2, and sometimes children get up to five shots in one doctor's visit.While most people follow the recommended timetable, IOM said about 1 percent of Americans refuse all vaccines.The reasons vary. Some object for religious reasons but others are concerned that underlying medical conditions could raise the risk of possible complications from the injections. Others worry potential harms outweigh the benefits or simply mistrust the government, which reviews and approves vaccines before they can be marketed.Still, most parents comply.Pamela Maslen, a registered nurse and lactation consultant in Silver Spring, Maryland, said her work overseas influenced her decision to follow the recommendations when her first daughter was born nearly five years ago.""I pretty much decided I wanted to keep on the schedule because I knew we would be moving, and I didn't want her to be susceptible to anything,"" said Maslen, 35, who has two daughters and is expecting her third child soon. SOME PARENTS STILL WORRYIOM's panel of independent scientists looked at the schedule of immunizations and all available scientific data to determine safety. They also reviewed CDC and the Food and Drug Administration databases that track side effects.Yet suspicions over vaccines have continued for years. Nearly 40 percent of U.S. parents have some mistrust of childhood vaccines, the CDC has said.Some suspicions arose over autism and thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative once used in many U.S. vaccines that was later removed from childhood vaccines. No studies have shown a clear link, and IOM said in 2004 that researchers should look elsewhere for a cause to the disorder.""The concerns are certainly still out there,"" said Cassandra Jessee, 39, who opted to ""delay"" the vaccines for her 16-month-old son by spreading them over several months rather than one doctor's visit.""It means more co-pays and doctors appointments, but to me it is worth it,"" she said."

CLARY,TORSTEN BLACKWOOD/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb9f426000033007f97d2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In my first book, Raising Boys Without Men, I noted the importance of actively seeking out male role models for boys growing up in homes without fathers. But we know that even boys with dads at home benefit from having a variety of personal heroes. That's because boys will pull from the different people in their lives the traits and qualities they need and admire (which is why role models for boys needn't, and shouldn't, be exclusively male). Viable role models can include babysitters, tutors, coaches, scout leaders, camp counselors, friends and neighbors. Role models can also include men and women boys will never even come into contact with: sports superstars, inventors, authors, musicians, artists and leaders in the fields of business and politics, and even characters in novels like Harry Potter.   But what happens when a child's heroes break the law, hurt others, make terrible choices or otherwise disappoint?   In most cases, the misdeeds of a role model who is far removed will have far less impact than those of one close to him. That is, the fact that Tiger Woods had an affair (or many) is likely to be far less jarring to a boy than hearing the same about his favorite math teacher or, of course, his own father. At the same time, boys place great stock in their public idols. These idols often help inspire and motivate. They represent hope and possibility. In many ways, they influence the men that boys become. This Thursday on television, Lance Armstrong will admit to Oprah Winfrey that he used performance enhancing drugs during a long and celebrated cycling career. Perhaps he will address allegations that he bullied teammates into doping as well, and admit to having lied to many people, for many years. And while it's easy for parents to get angry at men like Armstrong for letting kids down, situations like his present a great opportunity to talk to kids about dealing with disappointment. And about what it means to admire someone for a particular talent or skill versus what it means to consider a person a role model. Because the two are often very different. First, make no excuses. Don't sugarcoat the offenses. If a role model cheated or lied, say that. If he hurt others, say that, too. Give kids the facts, and explain why an action is wrong. As in, ""Barry Bonds used performance enhancing drugs to be better at baseball. That's against the laws set by his country and his sport, and since it's a form of cheating, it's also unethical."" Talk to them about how a person's actions had an effect on others: his family, his teammates or c-oworkers, his community.Offer perspective. Help kids realize that athletes and other role models are not infallible. Heroes are real people, and people are flawed. Like most of us, heroes will usually require forgiveness at some point in their lives. But also let them know that lying, cheating and disappointing others, no matter how famous a person is or isn't, is not normal, or excusable, behavior. Let them know it's OK to be angry. Of course, just because human beings are fallible doesn't mean we can't have high expectations for them. The people we choose to look to as role models -- whether a sports hero or a favorite uncle -- are different from everyday people. We're allowed to expect better of them. And if they don't meet those expectations, we're allowed to look elsewhere for inspiration. Talk about the need for honesty. Most fallen role models not only do something wrong, which is bad, but lie about it, which is worse. Use the opportunity to teach kids how to handle mistakes. Take them through the steps: Accept responsibility, express remorse, ask for forgiveness, make amends and don't make the same mistake again. Let your child know that whether or not he decides to forgive a role model is up to him, but that how a role model behaves in the wake of his mistakes can, and should, play an important part in that. Be truthful and frank about the consequences. When Michael Phelps was caught smoking pot in 2009, he was suspended and lost a lucrative contract. In the case of Armstrong, of course, he was stripped of his Tour de France titles, may be required to return sponsorship money and may face criminal prosecution. Talk to kids about the very real consequences of bad decisions. Emphasize careful thought before action. Help your son identify what characteristics he admires in others. Ask your son what he feels makes someone a hero. Sure, an athlete who can score 18 touchdowns in a single game may be worthy of adoration. But what else makes him a man? Does he treat his teammates with respect? Does he donate his time to help others? Is he a good father? If he wasn't a gifted athlete, would he be someone your son would want to know, and why? Show kids that the best role models are worthy of adulation not just because of what they've accomplished, but how they've accomplished it. Be proactive in helping him choose other role models. It's key for kids to recognize that no one role model will ever be perfect. Which is one reason it's wise to encourage boys to look up to a range of heroes, both close to home and at a distance. And keep in mind that not every male in your son's life needs to be role model material. Ask your son often what he thinks of others and their actions, and he'll learn to tell the difference between someone to appreciate and someone to admire.

Or, they can try something different -- like banding together and funding one brilliant national counter-marketing campaign.",2013-01-16,"In this picture taken on Saturday, Sept. 8, 2012, Iranian worker Mahmoud Kouhi, carries to cans of Coca cola beverage, in a grocery store in northern Tehran, Iran. Even after decades of diplomatic estrangement and tightening economic sanctions, American products find their way to the Islamic Republic through back channel exporters, licensing workarounds and straightforward trade in goods not blocked by U.S. embargoes. In Iran, it's possible to check your email on an iPhone, sip a Coke and hit the gym wearing Nikes. (AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb9fd2500003300362ea7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Coca-Cola, battered by research that shows its sugary drinks are heavily related to our nation's epidemic of obesity and besieged by the introduction/passage of sugary drink taxes and portion caps, is fighting back. They just unveiled a new commercial in which they attempt to convince Americans that they are offering ""solutions"" to the obesity epidemic with their diet drink portfolio, charitable contributions to fitness programs and by helpfully pointing out that if you take in more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. It's a brilliant marketing strategy.So where is the well-funded, national anti-soda counter-marketing campaign that will set Americans straight? It doesn't exist, because public health advocates can't afford that kind of campaign and must make do with fragmented local marketing messages and YouTube videos. Isn't it time for obesity-prevention public health funders to pool their money and fund one anti-soda/anti-junk food marketing campaign nationally? One of the reasons we have an obesity epidemic in this country is because Coca-Cola, Pepsi and other purveyors of junk food have been allowed to flood our airwaves and almost every other aspect of our lives with a steady drumbeat of feel-good, misleading marketing. These companies spend billions of dollars promoting unhealthy, non-nutritious products on TV, radio, in print, on mobile devices, on the Internet, on clothing, at concerts, in schools, at sporting events, on giveaways and in countless other venues. And because Coca-Cola and other soft drink companies can afford to saturate the marketplace with their messages and use the top ad/marketing agencies to create their campaigns, they tend to be brilliant -- tapping into human emotions and successfully associating their sugary drinks with happiness, fulfillment and having fun. Big Soda spends big dollars on these types of campaigns, because they work.Please don't feed me Big Soda's defensive nonsense about how kids and adults must take ""personal responsibility"" for what they ingest. In a world saturated by professionally-designed, emotional marketing messages that implore people to drink soda and other sugary drinks 24/7, can we really blame people, particularly kids and teens, for overconsumption? Coke and others have expertly positioned their beverages as benign, happy drinks. Coke's new ""obesity"" ad campaign is yet another example of their marketing brilliance and ability to manipulate messages and the public.So where does Coca-Cola's new obesity campaign leave public health advocates? Playing catch-up, as always. The ridiculously-underfunded yet scrappy public health community has made impressive dents in Big Soda's armor. On the marketing front, the Center for Science in the Public Interest and advertising guru Alex Bogusky produced a brilliant anti-soda video, ""The Real Bears,"" that has more than 2 million views. But there's no funding available to turn ""The Real Bears"" into a traditional national advertising campaign where you'd see a version on TV, in print and splashed all over the Internet, and on mobile devices, like the soda companies can afford to do. The introduction of soda taxes and sugary drink portion caps across the country and the resulting press coverage has created a new level of awareness among the general public. But without proper funding to counter the tens of millions of dollars that Big Soda has spent on advertising campaigns to kill these measures (only NYC's portion cap has passed), advocates continue to be at a huge disadvantage.Obesity prevention funders can continue to fund dozens of small local or regional anti-soda/anti-junk food campaigns that will have limited impact. Or, they can try something different -- like banding together and funding one brilliant national counter-marketing campaign.As long as the public health world is forced to operate in a piecemeal fashion with limited funding, progress in lowering consumption of sugary drinks will be slow. And more Americans will get sick and die.For more by Nancy Huehnergarth, click here.For more health news, click here. "
