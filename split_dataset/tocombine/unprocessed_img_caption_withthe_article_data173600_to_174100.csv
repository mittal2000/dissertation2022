1,TECH,Windows 8 Vocabulary Terms You Need To Talk Intelligently About Microsoft's New OS,Jason Gilbert,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/windows-8-help_us_5bb35ab3e4b0fa920b96e5f6,"Quickness -- (We cheated on 'Q', sue us.) Microsoft has drastically improved the time it takes to boot up a Windows 8 machine",2012-10-27,"An attendant demonstrates the Microsoft Windows 8 operating system during its launching ceremony in Hong Kong Friday, Oct. 26, 2012. Microsoft launched a radical redesign of its world-dominating Windows operating system, introducing a touch-enabled interface that attempts to bridge the gap between personal computers and fast-growing mobile devices powered by the company's fiercest competitors. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb35ab3240000320055d58e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Microsoft's much-anticipated Windows 8 operating system is out and ready for your purchase. Here's everything you need to know, from A to Z:Apps -- New to Windows with Windows 8, Microsoft now has a Windows Store where you can download apps both free and paid. Works exactly like the iOS App Store or Google Play Store you are familiar with from your smartphone. Bing -- Microsoft's search engine is front-and-center on the new Windows by default, with apps for Bing Travel, Bing Search, Bing Weather, Bing News and Bing Maps appearing standard on most Windows machines. Charms -- A set of buttons and commands that control the application you are currently using. A ""Charm Bar,"" which contains all of those charms, can be swiped on from the right side of the screen at any time and can change that app's settings, search within that app, share content from the app to social networks and email, or send content from that app to a printer or connected device. Desktop Mode -- The Windows design familiar to those who have used any version between Windows 95 and Windows 7, with the Start bar (minus Start button) on the bottom and tiled icons and windows against a flat background. Can be accessed at any time by opening the ""desktop"" tile on the Start Screen. Email Address -- When you start your Windows 8 machine for the first time, you'll be asked to enter an email address to create a Microsoft account. With a Microsoft account, you can download apps from the Windows Store and sync settings between devices. File Explorer -- Formerly called Windows Explorer; it's the exact same look with a tweaked name. This is your view of all the content on your desktop and pops up in Desktop Mode. Games -- Heavily emphasized by Microsoft in its presentations, the Games app lets you download games to your device. You can also compete against friends with Xbox Games accounts, just as you would in Apple's GameCenter. The look and concept will be very familiar to those who own an Xbox. Help -- If you need help at any time, you can search the word ""help"" from the Start Screen to bring up tutorials or troubleshooting menus. Probably a good word to remember for your first few days on Windows 8.Internet Explorer 10 -- Beautifully redesigned as a full-screen app and default browser for Windows 8. Watch it in action here (but know that, yes, Google has outed a Chrome browser for Windows 8, too). Jarring -- How critics of Windows 8 sum up the dual nature of desktop mode and Metro. Windows 8 is ""split in 2,"" per David Pogue at The New York Times, and that can be difficult to get used to as you switch back and forth between applications and different screens.Keyboard Shortcuts -- Windows 8 works best on touchscreen computers, so that you can swipe your finger across the screen to complete vital actions; for those upgrading from older machines, however, you either have to use your touchpad to accomplish this or memorize some keyboard shortcuts that quickly accomplish the equivalent of swipes. David Pogue (from the ""J"" entry above!) has compiled a handy cheat sheet at The New York Times. Learning Curve -- It can be steep for users new to Windows 8, but most reviewers (and this writer) have gotten comfortable with the operating system after extended exposure.Metro -- The popular name for the new look of Windows 8, with the rectangular tiles and colorful background. The name was changed to the clunky ""New Windows 8 UI"" to avoid a trademark issue. Most still refer to the design as ""Metro,"" however. New Windows 8 UI -- See above. Office 2013 -- Microsoft's legendary productivity suite has been overhauled to work more like Google Docs, so that your documents, spreadsheets, and presentations can be accessed and edited from any device by visiting the Microsoft website. Runs in Desktop mode. Read more about the new Office here. Pin to Start -- The new ""Create Icon On Homescreen."" If you want an app on your main screen, you can choose to ""Pin to Start"" so that it appears as a tile on the Windows 8 home base. You can also resize many tiles to make them larger or smaller. Quickness -- (We cheated on 'Q', sue us.) Microsoft has drastically improved the time it takes to boot up a Windows 8 machine so that you could potentially go from power-off to your Start Screen in seven seconds. That's fast. RT -- Windows RT is the edition of Windows designed to run specifically on tablets (like the aptly-named Microsoft Surface RT). Though it comes with desktop mode, it can only run certain apps certified by Microsoft. Start Screen -- The first thing you see in Windows 8, and your new homescreen. Contains rectangular tiles representing your applications and programs. This is your gateway to any app on Windows 8; it can always be summoned by hitting the Windows key on your keyboard.Tiles -- Your new icons. Some are ""live tiles,"" which update in real-time with information as it comes in (for example, the Weather tile will always show the current weather in your location so that you don't have to open up the app to see current conditions). Upgrade -- Those with PCs can upgrade to Windows 8 for $39.99 for the next several months: That gets you a digital copy, with software will automatically bring over your current information into Windows 8. A physical copy costs $68. Versions -- There are two: Windows 8 and Windows RT. Windows 8 runs on desktops and laptops; Windows RT runs primarily on tablets. The big difference: Windows 8 can run all applications, including those written for older versions of Windows, while Windows RT can only run applications downloaded through the Store and certified by Microsoft. Windows Key -- This keyboard key, which used to open your Start menu, now switches to the Start Screen whenever you press it. It doesn't exist on your current app, just switches screens. Press it again to switch back to your previous app. Xbox Music -- The innovative, ambitious new music service from Microsoft aiming to take down Spotify, Pandora and iTunes in one fell swoop. A freeware version comes bundled with Windows 8. Read more about it here. You -- The center of Windows 8, according to Microsoft PR. A ""People"" app on the Start Screen flips through photos of your friends from social networks and also displays updates from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and more. Microsoft also encourages users to personalize their Start Screen design and set a photo of their family members as the lock screen image to really make devices their own. Zune -- The public reception -- or lack thereof -- that Microsoft is desperately, desperately hoping to avoid with its boldest, most ambitious new product in years, and one that could very well determine the fate of the company. No pressure or anything. "

""I don't care,"" said one viewer after a private screening of a new documentary, Roman Polanski: A Film Memoir, a conversation between his longtime friend, producer Andrew Braunsberg and the filmmaker while he was under house arrest in Gstaad, Switzerland, ""he still had sex with a teen.""The documentary, consisting of two men talking, inspired by My Dinner with Andre, may still not sit well with viewers unnerved by the famed director's transgressions, but this memoir also goes into his stellar career and the more horrific aspects of his life, deftly melding his memories with archival footage. He was himself a child when he began his odyssey through World War II Krakow, his mother taken directly to a death camp, his father to Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria. Clips from The Pianist, Oliver Twist, and Tess show how he incorporated key images from his life into the films. Interviewed in 2002 when The Pianist won prizes at Cannes and the Oscar, its star Adrien Brody said that many Holocaust details informed Polanski's direction, even to the way a person fell when shot.Surviving the war, Polanski was an art student before he was accepted into the prestigious Lodz film school and acted in a film directed by Andrej Wadja. His first feature, Knife in the Water, angered the Communist regime but became a hit in Europe. Repulsion, with Catherine Deneuve, was his attempt at a horror film; he finds it a compromise to his real ambitions at filmmaking. Audiences may judge for themselves: Repulsion opens at Film Forum on Halloween for a two week run.The horror genre does not compare to the real life murder of his pregnant wife Sharon Tate by the Manson clan. At the time, the media pointed to Polanski, who was in London completing a film, for having something to do with the rampage. The scandal with Samantha Geimer would follow, with the media outing her despite attempts to keep her identity hidden. As she has said, the tabloids caused more harm than Polanski did. He has apologized to her and her mother. Now a family man, married to actress Emmanuelle Seigner for decades and the father of two, he is making a movie of David Ives' stage play, Venus in Fur, with his wife to star.Supported by a close cadre of friends, family, and artistic collaborators, Roman Polanski by his own admission leads a good life.

Kelly says Golson did well during a full workout and will start for the No. 5 Fighting Irish at No. 8 Oklahoma on Saturday. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6bd1a250000360039bbb3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dave Miller, National Football PostNotre Dame takes its stingy defense, allowing just 9.4 points per game, into Norman on Saturday night to battle Oklahoma, which is suddenly back in the BCS national championship game race after an early-season loss to Kansas State.So how can the Fighting Irish thwart a Sooners offensive attack that is averaging 44.7 points per game?Let's take a look at what Brian Kelly's squad has to do to remain unbeaten.• Red-zone clamp-down: We saw Notre Dame's stout defense snuff out a Stanford game-ending drive a few weeks ago, as Cardinal running back Stepfan Taylor was unable to get into the end zone in the Irish win. But while the Stanford run game behind its O-Line is quite formidable, it is nothing compared to OU's goal-line offense, which is pretty much unstoppable. The power run game in the red zone has been very productive for the Sooners, and backup quarterback Blake Bell has had a huge role. In the ""Belldozer"" package, the signal-caller is able to use his power and push through after initial contact. But he's not just a plower; he's patient and is able to read his blocks well behind a wall that sometimes consists of six offensive linemen. Granted, OU hasn't faced a front seven such as Notre Dame's. But ND hasn't faced a red-zone package such as OU's either. Also keep an eye on Trey Millard, who is more than just a lead blocker as we saw in the game against Texas. He could be deadly as a receiver out of the backfield near the goal line, especially when ND thinks Bell is going to keep it and run.  • Be disciplined against the screen: While Damien Williams has been vital to the OU rushing attack this fall, he is likely going to struggle to find a lot of running lanes against an ND front that features nose tackle Louis Nix III, end Stephon Tuitt and inside linebacker Manti Te'o. The Sooners will try the power attack just to test ND early, but even utilizing two fullbacks won't provide much running room for Williams against a beefy defensive line. But Irish defensive coordinator Bob Diaco must be cognizant of OU co-offensive coordinators Josh Heupel and Jay Norvell employing screens as a default ground game. If for nothing else, OU will try to ground it out just to set up play action and negate the Notre Dame safeties. We have yet to see Irish cornerbacks Bennett Jackson and KeiVarae Russell exposed this year. And while a lot of OU's pass plays are not deep throws, look for quarterback Landry Jones to take some shots down the field, especially on play action, so those corners have to make some plays on the outside. Receiver Kenny Stills must be able to have one or two big plays for this OU offense to have some breathing room.• Pressure Jones: We've seen ""Good Landry"" and ""Bad Landry."" The OU signal-caller is very good when he has time and is not pressured, as is the case for most quarterbacks. But if he feels pressure, he can make mistakes. The Irish have the rushers up front to pressure Jones, specifically Tuitt. Look for OU to keep an extra player in the backfield for added pass protection and to give Jones extra time. The Sooners quarterback doesn't move well when he's on the run, however, and the Irish will look to make him uncomfortable with pressure both inside and off of the edges. It will be interesting to see if Diaco has some added wrinkles for this matchup against Jones.• A turnover-free offense: Notre Dame's ground game has finally hit its stride under Kelly, with Cierre Wood, George Atkinson III and Theo Riddick giving the Irish consistent production from the tailback position. But the Irish will face a stiff test from OU's front, where Jamarkus McFarland and Casey Walker have been having standout seasons. Everett Golson's legs could be needed more than ever on some option plays if a traditional downhill attack is kept in check. And Golson will also need to deal with the hostile crowd in Norman. We'll unquestionably see Tommy Rees as well, as Kelly trusts him to come in and move the offense. For the Irish to steal this road game, Golson and Rees must remain turnover-free. How will Rees deal with the OU pass rush? And can Golson keep calm while dealing with a difficult road atmosphere?Certainly, the Fighting Irish have quite the test Saturday night on the road against a team that struggled to protect the football in its lone loss to Kansas State. But OU has been dominant the past three weeks in conference play, winning games by margins of 21, 42 and 45 points. This game should be close the whole way through, but OU's defense has certainly been revitalized under Mike Stoops. That could be the difference.Email dave.miller@nationalfootballpost.com or follow me on Twitter at Miller_Dave"

I met Sandefer while teaching at OU's Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communications in the fall of 2007, and wrote about his role in the historic game at the time. So I called him the other day at his home in Norman, which is just a few blocks from OU's football stadium, and from his close friend, former Sooners coach Barry Switzer, and it was clear he was excited about Saturday's game.As I wrote at the time, Sandefer was a 165-pound junior running back who remembered every detail of the iconic game like it was yesterday. Oklahoma was ranked No. 2, and had beaten the Fighting Irish 40-0 the year before in South Bend. Notre Dame was an 18-point underdog when it arrived in Norman to play before 63,170 jubilant homecoming fans. The game was still scoreless late in the third quarter when Sandefer returned a Notre Dame punt to the Irish 34. But the drive stalled, and Notre Dame drove 80 yards in 20 plays for the winning touchdown late in the fourth quarter.It was fourth-and-four on the OU three-yard line, and Sandefer watched helplessly as halfback Dick Lynch took a pitch-out from quarterback Bob Williams and scored with 3:50 remaining. The Sooners returned the kickoff to their 39 and advanced to the Notre Dame 24 before Notre Dame intercepted a pass with less than a minute to go to end the game.Sandefer, a retired Texas oil tycoon who moved to Norman from Houston in 2003 so he could follow Oklahoma football more closely, was as stunned as his teammates and Sooner fans. ""It was a devastating loss,"" he recalled. ""Being so young, I didn't know of anything that was so devastating at the time.""But Sandefer said he never forgot what Wilkinson told his team afterwards. ""Coach Wilkinson came into the dressing room and said, 'I'm proud of you guys.' He said, 'You've won 47 straight games. That's something nobody will ever do again. Remember, the only ones who never lose are the ones who never play.'""The loss to Notre Dame dropped the Sooners to No. 6, but they rebounded the next week with a 32-7 win over Nebraska in Lincoln, extending their conference winning streak to 65, then went on to beat archrival Oklahoma State 53-6, and played Duke in the Orange Bowl.Duke pulled within 21-14 before Sandefer scored on a three-yard run late in the third quarter, and OU went on to win 48-21, still an Orange Bowl record. The Sooners finished with a 10-1 record and were ranked fourth in the AP and UPI polls.When I interviewed him in 2007, Sandefer showed me the scrapbook his mother compiled during his three years as a Sooner regular, and opened it to the page from the Dallas newspaper that reported his team's loss to Notre Dame. Sandefer hopes Coach Bob Stoops' Sooners, who are 5-1 this year, will still have a shot at a national championship if they can hand the 7-0 Irish their first loss. That would go a long way towards healing the sting of a loss he still feels after more than half a century."

Which is very much the case with this Saturday's epic clash, as it's being dubbed, against Notre Dame.Few could have predicted the upcoming Top 10 showdown, however for very different reasons. Even the most ardent Irish fans wouldn't have predicted a 7-0 start, while Oklahoma fans were expecting just that. Regardless of the circumstances, the two teams will come together on Owen Field Saturday night in what has easily been the most anticipated game in Norman, Oklahoma since the 2000 meeting with then No. 1 ranked Nebraska.Coming into the game, the headline match-up is certainly the vaunted Notre Dame defense versus a well-balanced and versatile Oklahoma offense. However, this Oklahoma defense could have their hands full with the athletic Everett Golson who will return to his starting quarterback position for the Irish after sitting out last week's game against BYU.Golson is the type of quarterback who has given Oklahoma fits in the past. He's the kind of player who can make something out of nothing and just when you think you've nailed him behind the line of scrimmage, he finds a way to wiggle out of it and make positive yards. Limiting Golson's ability to make plays outside the pocket and forcing him to try and beat you with his arm, as opposed to his legs, will be the primary focus of this Oklahoma defense.Now, back to our main feature of the evening. The Sooners are lead on offense by fifth year senior Landry Jones who recently set the school record for most wins by a quarterback. Despite an, at times, somewhat contentious relationship with the Oklahoma fan base, Jones' play has improved considerably following the Sooners lone loss on the season to Kansas State. Since playing poorly against the Wildcats, Jones has made a noticeable effort to be more efficient with his passes rather than forcing things that aren't there.This will be key Saturday night as mistakes that lead to costly turnovers were the primary reason for Oklahoma's only loss on the season and could play a huge role in the game Saturday night. This Notre Dame defense is one of the top in the country and they have a bevy of difference makers littered throughout their front seven. It will be a challenge for the Sooners to run the ball consistently against the Irish, so expect the burden of moving the ball to fall squarely on the shoulders of Jones and the Oklahoma wide receivers.Fortunately, the Sooners have no shortage of options in that department most notably by junior Kenny Stills who leads the team in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdown receptions. Jones' other options are Penn State transfer Justin Brown, (who has made more of an impact than anyone could have predicted), another transfer (from Fresno State) player in Jalen Saunders, and true freshman Sterling Shepard. They will be responsible for attacking what is widely regarded to be the weak link of this Notre Dame defense and that is their secondary.This advantage could be even further magnified should, as many expect, Notre Dame to remain in their base defense which would force their linebackers to attempt to cover Oklahoma's wide receivers. This particular match-up should favor the Sooners significantly and if they can exploit it, as most experts anticipate they will attempt to do, could very well prove to be the difference in the game.SCORE PREDICTION: OKLAHOMA 30 NOTRE DAME 21If Oklahoma can avoid turning the ball over, it's difficult to envision a scenario where Notre Dame scores more than 20 or so points. The Irish offense has struggled to score consistently this season and in a big game, on the road, against an Oklahoma defense that is clicking on all levels at the moment, it's unlikely that trend comes to an end Saturday night. Oklahoma should have just enough to win a hard fought game on their home field in what could prove to be a historical night for two of the country's most renowned college football programs.Jordan EscoCo-Editor, Crimson and Cream Machine"

The Fighting Irish of Notre Dame are seven games into the season and are only hours away from the kickoff of the eighth test of the season. Thus far, Notre Dame has passed every single one of those tests and is sitting at 7-0 and ranked No. 5 in the country. There are some, and by ""some,"" I mean most of the country, that still doubt this team. The 7-0 record means very little to Joe Fan when most of the wins have come in the so-called, ""ugly fashion,"" against teams that have not performed as well as most had thought, prior to the season.That's absolutely insane in my eyes -- especially when the season in just about two-thirds finished. I'm not going to sit here and put up an argument to defend the schedule, but I will say that there are no FCS opponents and all but Navy are in a BCS conference.All of these tests, and here is the toughest test that they have had yet, and probably will have during the regular season.Oklahoma.There are all sorts of numbers for both Notre Dame and Oklahoma that we can dissect and analyze, but frankly, it is going to come down to the best unit from both teams; Oklahoma's offense versus Notre Dame's defense. The Sooners are being billed as an absolute offensive juggernaut. While I find their offense to be very formidable, I don't believe that Oklahoma has faced a defense as good as Notre Dame's.The matchup within the matchup will be the Sooner wide receivers against the secondary of Notre Dame. Fast, slick, and dangerous are good ways to describe guys like Kenny Stills & Justin Brown. They're good. Like, really good. When you look across from them three guys in their first year starting (Bennett Jackson, KeiVarae Russell, and Mathias Farley) it is natural to think that the Irish defenders will get schooled.In the words of Mascot Head Gear Aficionado, Lee Corso... NOT SO FAST MY FRIEND!Notre Dame's secondary is better than advertised. Bennett Jackson has four interceptions (tied for the team lead with All-Universe linebacker, Manti Te'o) and even though Russell is a true freshman that was recruited to play running back, he has been very good in coverage all season. Zeke Motta punishes everything that comes within five yards, and Mathias Farley has made the loss of Jamoris Slaughter seem like it never happened.How is all of this possible with so many new guys? Two reasons: 1. An elite pass rush and 2. Excellent leadership.Prince Shembo, Kapron Louis-Moire, Louis Nix III, and Stephon Tuitt have been lighting up offensive lines and quarterbacks all season. Their ability to get pressure, sacks, and disrupt any attempt at running the ball has allowed the Irish secondary to play its zone coverage, with the help of their linebackers, on a very efficient level. It's not rocket science. If you can pressure the quarterback and still be able to drop seven or eight guys in coverage, you are going to win a lot of those battles.Factor that in with the leadership, skill, and absolute drive from Manti Te'o and you have a defense that is the #2 ranked scoring defense, that has allowed the fewest touchdowns in the country- and has yet to give up a rushing touchdown all season (that streak actually goes back to November of last year).You just can't do all of that and have a secondary be as bad as some are making them out to be.PREDICTION: The defense gets to Landry Jones early and often and we watch as he drops like a bunch of broccoli. Because of that, the vaunted Sooner passing game will be greatly slowed down and frustration gives way to turnovers. Meanwhile, the Irish offense will continue to do what it has done all season and pound the ball for four quarters on the ground. Brian Kelly will take a few shots and have Golson throw deep. Notre Dame scores when it needs to and wins a HUGE game on the road, 23-20.For more Fighting Irish Football coverage, check out Subway Domer."

A: ""A well person is a patient who has not been completely worked up.""As I enter the exam room, a smiling 10-year-old boy greets me. Pete, my last patient of a long day, is here for his annual well visit. I chat with him about his life -- home, school, nutrition, exercise, sleep, etc. -- and I'm struck by something. Pete is really well. He's well-fed (but not too much), active and well-rested, and, most importantly, he's happy. He has not been to see me in an entire year, and only comes in for preventive health counseling. I think back on my entire day... and on my whole week. Pete is different from every other child I have seen this week. He is, in fact, the only truly ""well"" child I have seen in a long, long time. And I wonder -- is he the last?I've begun this post with a short riff on Dr. Clifton Meador's satirical masterpiece, ""The Last Well Person,"" published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1994. Meador profiles a 53-year-old man he imagines to be the last known truly ""well"" person in the U.S. in 1998. The patient is subjected to every known evaluation and found to be basically undiagnosable. I reflect on this story each day as I enter one examination room after another, visiting with patients (and their families) in my pediatric practice. Sadly, the story of ""Pete"" is real. I no longer see many well kids even though I am a primary care pediatrician, dedicated to keeping kids healthy. Yes, I devote much of my time to counseling parents about lifestyle choices (e.g., nutrition, exercise, play, rest, sleep) to promote wellness and prevent disease. Still, each and every encounter must be ""coded"" with a numerical set of instructions based on diagnoses (associated with disease states) so that I can get reimbursed for the care I deliver. My ability to keep my office open (so that I can continue to try and help families keep their children healthy) is predicated on my skill in playing this diagnostic code game. Are there ""well child"" codes? Yes, thankfully. But they do not pay as well per block of time as my ""sick visit"" codes. I am better off financially if I see more sick kids per day -- assuming I assign the most appropriate high-level codes to these visits -- than spending my time focusing on preventive counseling. Not that these children are better off. In the long run, they will be subjected to more and more medical care for their asthma, diabetes, ADHD, or whatever chronic illness they develop. Meador's thesis -- that the practice of medicine has become consumed by creating and labeling conditions that do not truly reflect illness -- is a cautionary tale, more true today than ever before. This epidemic of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, created by a disease-treatment system dressed in health care system's clothing, is a self-perpetuating Mobius strip leading to a sicker America. What are the costs -- real and opportunity -- of a system in which everyone is, well, ""un-well""?Doctors from the Center for Child and Adolescent Health Policy at Boston's MassGeneral Hospital for Children wrote:The number of children and youth in the United States with chronic health conditions (a health condition that lasts >12 months or at time of diagnosis is likely to have a duration of >12 months) has increased dramatically in the past four decades ... Health and social welfare systems are unprepared for the rapid growth in demands that will arise from these epidemics, and major increases in public expenditures should be planned for in the near term. For the longer term, the epidemic growth of childhood chronic conditions calls for major efforts to understand causation and means of prevention.The debate rages as to why more children are diagnosed with chronic health conditions. Better diagnosing? More ill kids due to environmental factors? Both? While I do not agree we are ""better"" at diagnosing, I do think we are better at labeling. There's a subtle difference. Over the past 20 years, we have shifted the curve to include more children in certain diagnostic categories. Why? Because more diagnoses equal more money. More for hospitals and physicians who diagnose and treat, more for insurance companies who can charge higher premiums based on covering a sicker population, and more for pharmaceutical companies who make the drugs we increasingly use to treat. We are spending more money per child to perform diagnostic tests and treat health ills due to chronic conditions that could have been prevented in the first place. Some of these conditions are not necessarily illnesses, in fact. I took issue with an article published last year in Pediatrics, my guild's preeminent scientific journal, regarding the treatment of elevated cholesterol in children with statin medications. Before we start advocating the prescription of these heavy-duty medications for young children, shouldn't we first establish that the benefit of the treatment outweighs its risk? Or even that the risk of the disease is outweighed by the risk of the treatment? My colleagues will argue there are cases of children with genetically-predisposed extreme elevations in cholesterol, placing these kids at tremendous risk for premature catastrophic cardiovascular events (heart attacks, strokes). Agreed -- but these cases are really rare. Most children with cholesterol numbers higher than a given number (used to be 200, now it's 170: more shifting the curve) are diagnosed with ""hypercholesterolemia."" But is this diagnosis actually correlated in most cases with any true disease? And if it is -- if it's a risk factor for early heart disease, for example -- shouldn't we first consider safer, more effective and more cost-efficient alternatives, such as dietary change and exercise? This one example exemplifies the mess we've created by economically and morally incentivizing a disease-treatment system. These challenges are not insurmountable. I prefer to think of them as opportunities for sustainable change. We must look to our own communities and study small-scale prevention models that are working. There are numerous integrative, intergenerational, ground-up programs that break down traditional silos and involve multiple segments of the community. I'll be profiling these models in future posts, hoping that their stories motivate others to take notice. I sincerely hope that we, as a society, wake up and recognize the costs of the problem-based disease culture we've created. It's not too late. I don't really believe my patient Pete is unique. But we must resist labeling and treating our children for conditions resulting from ill-fated attempts to shoehorn them into increasingly stressful and restrictive environments. What will it take to move to a strength-based model of care, in which we promote and celebrate what's right with each child? Imagine that. Next week, each and every time I enter an exam room, I'm going to look for more ""Petes."" Me: ""Good morning, Mrs. Jones. Can you tell me what's right with your child today?"" I'm going to lead with that, because I don't really believe that I've seen the last well child.References:[1] Perrin JM, Bloom SR, Gortmaker SL.

Some stay that way, able to handle the ups and downs of wedding planning with poise, but there are others who evolve into monsters in human clothing. You know the type: the bridezillas.  A bridezilla, by definition, is a cross between a bride and Godzilla. They're a dangerous lot, breathe fire and wreak havoc on any and all innocent bystanders. And for what? Their own obsession with wedding perfection is what.  Note to bridezillas: perfection doesn't exist.  But what if you were in the wedding party of a bride who wasn't just un-bridezilla in her behavior, but so far at the other end of the spectrum that it left you mesmerized? A bride so calm, so serene in the face of chaos, you wondered when the ticking time bomb was set to explode.  I've witnessed that serene bride, and while at first her behavior had me petrified, ultimately she taught me one of the biggest lessons of my life.***  My friend Kelsey got married two years ago in the gorgeous town of Crested Butte, Colorado. Kelsey, having three brothers, has always been one of the boys. But when it came down to her wedding, we began to see her ""girly"" side -- particularly when it came to her dress and shoes. The tomboy we had always known was all of a sudden trying on Vera Wang and Monique Lhuillier and demanding that she have a dress that equaled what some people make a year. It was in those beginning stages that we all prepared for the worst, and assumed a bridezilla scenario was on our hands.After the dress and shoes were acquired, Kelsey's anxiety about the wedding dropped so low, it was virtually non-existent. Even as the big day crept up and she had a falling out with one of the bridesmaids who bailed, and a two-year-old ring-bearer got sick, she managed to keep it together. As we all gripped each other's hands and prepared for her head to explode, she shrugged everything off.  On the day of her wedding, the linen colors were mismatched and the florist left her two centerpieces short. At this point, her wedding was just four hours away, so again, we all watched in fear that at some point she was going to lose it and lash out, but she still kept it together. None of us had ever witnessed a bride so relaxed, so at peace with the drama and crumbling of their wedding plans, that we assumed she was having some sort of internal crisis that was so severe she was in a state of shock. We took turns asking her how she was doing and if she was ""holding up,"" but every time we got back a smile and an affirmation that she was ""great.""  Each of us walked on eggshells as one by one things fell apart and we had to let her know that her dream wedding wasn't going to happen -- we were all terrified.. Just three hours before her wedding, as it started to rain, my sister and I had to inform her that the plumbing had given out. That's right; there would be no proper toilets, there would only be outhouses.  We broke the news gently, coddling her the best we could, but she just stared back with vacant eyes then started to laugh maniacally for several minutes. Were we supposed to laugh, too? Were we supposed to run for tissues for when she stopped because the floodgates would finally open? No. Nothing but loud, delirious laughter.  She looked around for her flip-flops, slipped them on her feet and said she was heading to the store to get waterless sterilizer since running water wasn't happening. I offered to go with her, but she said it wasn't necessary. Instead she offered to get everyone coffee while she was out.  ""Is anyone else concerned about what we're witnessing here?"" asked one of the bridesmaids after she left. We all agreed and assumed that Kelsey had gone to have a crying fit in the car where no one would see just how much she was being affected by it all. But when she returned, her makeup was intact and she had donuts for all of us. It was the ""Twilight Zone"" of bridal behavior.  Once it was officially time for the wedding -- an outdoor ceremony -- it began to storm. But Kelsey, having dreamed of an outdoor wedding in the mountains, didn't head indoors. She proceeded to get married in the rain as we all got soaked and devoured by mosquitoes. (Between the vows you could hear the smacking of people trying to kill the bugs that were feasting on our skin.)  It was during the reception, when part of the tent broke and the rain came pouring down, that we surely expected Kelsey to crack. It never happened; all we could hear was the maniacal laughter again. It was then I realized it was not the laughter of denial or a bride on the brink of a breakdown, but of sheer joy.  In that moment, I realized that love isn't about a perfect, flawless wedding. It's not about matching linens, working pipes or even a sunny day. It's about enjoying yourself; you've found the one you're about to spend the rest of your life with, and that's what it's really all about. Once you find that person, the stuff that seems like the end of the world to some, is actually romantic and memorable to others.  To this day, Kelsey's favorite photo from that night is of her and her husband, drenched from head to toe, embracing each other mid-laugh. The rest of us should be so lucky."
