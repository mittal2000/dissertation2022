But in far more detailed and foreboding terms than normal, McDonough lays out the administration's concerns should Corker's Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 end up becoming law. The bill, he writes, would ""likely have a profoundly negative impact on the ongoing negotiations -- emboldening Iranian hard-liners, inviting a counter-productive response from the Iranian majiles; differentiating the U.S. position from our allies in negotiations; and once again calling into question our ability to negotiate this deal.""""Put simply,"" adds McDonough, ""it would potentially make it impossible to secure international cooperation for additional sanctions, while putting at risk the existing multilateral sanctions regime.""READ THE FULL LETTER HEREComing just days before the March 24 deadline for a political framework for the final nuclear agreement, the Saturday night letter -- three pages, single spaced, in length -- is the latest indication of rising tensions between the White House and the Hill. At times assertive and, at others, combative, the letter warns Corker that his bill, which would give Congress the right to vote up or down on the final nuclear agreement, would cripple U.S. negotiators and lead Iran and international negotiating partners to question the U.S.' ability to follow through on its end of the bargain.It comes after months of Congress trying to insert itself into the negotiations between Iran, the U.S. and five partner countries. While the White House maintains it is nearing an agreement that will ensure Iran’s nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, lawmakers have insisted that President Barack Obama is prepared to sign a “bad deal"" that will leave too much of Iran’s nuclear facilities intact, allowing it to covertly develop a nuclear weapon. These concerns have been echoed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who, against the wishes of the White House, delivered a contentious speech on the House floor, warning that the current deal will “all but guarantee” Iran nuclear weapons. Matters came to a climactic point this past week, when Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) drafted a letter, signed by 46 other Republican senators, to Iranian leadership. The letter warned that any agreement could easily be reworked by Congress, or even overturned by a future president. The White House and Democratic lawmakers slammed the letter as a blatant attempt to undermine negotiations and the credibility of the White House. Notably absent from the signatories was Corker, who had been trying to recruit Democratic senators to build a veto-proof majority for his bill. Cotton's letter appears to have complicated those efforts. McDonough's letter -- from a wildly different philosophical vantage point -- is designed to shelve it entirely. ""The Administration's request to the Congress is simple: let us complete the negotiations before the Congress acts on legislation,"" writes McDonough. ""We understand that Congress will make its own determinations about how to respond, but we do not believe that the country's interests are served by congressional attempts to weigh in prematurely on this sensitive and consequential ongoing international negotiation aimed at achieving a goal that we all share: using diplomacy to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.""At the heart of the administration's concern with Corker's legislation are two separate issues. The first is the overarching message that the final vote of “approval” on the deal is within the purview of Congress. McDonough, in his letter, concedes a Republican concern: that the United Nations will have a role in implementing a final agreement. But that, he notes, is because the U.N. is the only entity with the authority to terminate the U.N. Security Council's sanctions on Iran. McDonough also assures Corker that the Senate will play a role -- ""and will have to take a vote"" -- in any final agreement. But that vote, he says, should come further down the line. There is ample precedent for a non-legally binding international treaty premised on political commitments, McDonough argues. And much of his letter is spent listing prior cases, the most recent being the U.S.-Russia framework to remove chemical weapons from Syria.The second concern in the letter is that Corker's bill eliminates one of the primary tools at the president's disposal to make sure that any Iran deal is successful. Under current law, only Congress can eliminate the statutory sanctions regime against Iran. The president, however, has the power to suspend them through waivers. Corker's bill would complicate that, prompting administration concerns that they'd lose a critical tool to make the final framework work.""The deal we are negotiating will allow us to retain significant leverage, as Iran would face severe consequences for any violation since we would have the capacity to swiftly re-impose punishing sanctions if Iran does not meet its commitments,"" writes McDonough.

The Syrian conflict, which this month enters its fifth year, shows no sign of easing. Since the start of the crisis in 2011, more than eleven million -- half of the population -- have been forced to flee the fighting and are now displaced inside the country, or have fled Syria to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Four years of conflict have set the country's development back for 40 years.A staggering 12.2 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, nearly half of whom are children and reaching these people is a constant challenge -- violence, denial of access to people in need, and administrative blockages mean aid workers are simply not able to get close to populations who need their help.Some 5,000 schools have been destroyed, occupied or targeted by parties to the conflict in gross violation of International Humanitarian Law. With 2.4 million children out of school and unable to learn, there is a risk that an entire generation will be lost.Health needs in Syria are acute, with more people dying of curable or chronic diseases than as a direct result of the violence. Diseases once thought to have been eradicated, like polio, tuberculosis and typhoid are re-surging, and there are fears that the country is being thrown back into the medical dark ages. There are widespread shortages in medical staff, as they have become increasingly and explicitly targeted by armed groups, and many have fled the country. The supply of medicines can hardly keep up with the demands and in some areas obstetrics, gynecological and pediatric services are simply unavailable.The Syria crisis is testing the hosting capacities of neighboring countries and their hospitality is at breaking point. When I visited Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon during the past three months, I heard from many refugees about the struggles they faced, the difficulties in finding jobs, paying rent, medical bills, or sending their children to school. With their meagre savings now exhausted, restrictions on refugees working in most of the host countries makes it almost impossible to support themselves and their families.  Christos Stylianides (left) visits informal tented settlement housing Syrian refugees in Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, 3 Jan 2015 -- Photo credit/European Union.Schools in host countries have struggled, many creating double-shifts in an attempt to accommodate new students; health services are creaking under the weight of higher case-loads; there have been water and electricity shortages because of the increase in demand and rents have sky-rocketed. A deteriorating security situation means borders are policed more tightly, and arrivals from Syria are viewed with greater suspicion. I have conveyed to the host governments the message that their concerns are well-understood, but urged them to abide by International Humanitarian Law and ensure that refugees are protected.Against this backdrop, humanitarian funding for the crisis is still struggling to keep up with the scale of ever-increasing populations' needs.The European Union remains committed to provide continued support -- both for refugees and to Syria's neighbors who are so generously hosting them. The European Commission and its Member States are among the largest humanitarian donors for the Syria crisis, having so far contributed more than 3.35 billion Euros. This is a strong sign that Europe cares, that we stand in solidarity with the people of Syria, who have suffered so much. During my visit to the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon, I saw what difference a joint approach across the various European instruments can make, where funding as well as expertise from the European Union's different branches -- humanitarian aid, development assistance and resilience -- are positively impacting the lives of Syrian refugees who have already lost so much.But this is not enough. It is time for the international community to step up its support. With no end in sight to the crisis, there's a need, more than ever, for humanitarian donors, agencies and governments to work even more closely in order to maintain protection, access and help when needs are growing. With the annual Syria pledging conference coming up at the end of the month in Kuwait, it is time for the international community to live up to its obligations and deliver.We need to take a fresh look at the delivery of assistance, and ensure the best use of limited resources, planning further ahead and shifting from crisis response to crisis management. We also need to link up with the development community, given the protracted nature of the crisis and its long-term effects, which will be felt for generations to come. In the face of such overwhelming needs it is now clear more than ever, that humanitarian aid can only mitigate the human suffering. In parallel, we support all efforts to halt the fighting and ultimately bring about a political solution to the crisis.These are huge challenges. We have no choice but to tackle them head-on. History is watching us."

Forty-seven Republican Senators tried to usurp the authority of the presidency and aid a foreign country in making a decision contrary to the stated policy of the government of the United States. Although Senator Cornyn (R-TX) declared that it is not only the president who speaks for the country in foreign affairs, he is completely wrong (except, perhaps, when the president is a black man, then the rest of the world needs to hear separately from white males). Add to that number Republican presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush (R-FL), Scott Walker (R-WI) and Bobby Jindal (R-LA). There are many questions these so-called hopefuls can be asked, but one can start with this: How can you be president if you applaud an unprecedented act interfering with the conduct of U.S. foreign policy by writing to our adversary encouraging it not to enter into an agreement with the U.S. and others?Moreover, the letter clearly aids-and-abets Iran as against the United States and its allies in the middle east. Iran can now refuse a deal, claim that members of the U.S. government have told them that the deal will not be honored anyhow, and know that the other members of the P5+1 negotiating for the rest of the world are far less likely to support further crippling sanctions if they walk away.Remember, it was only President Obama and his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who were able to gain the support of Russia and China so that economic sanctions would be strong enough to convince Iran to come to the bargaining table.The President's strategy has always been clear: Tighten the sanctions' noose to bring them to the negotiating table for a deal. If it is unsuccessful, the U.S. would have great moral authority as it would have been clear it went the extra mile to find a peaceful solution. Now, it is not only less likely will can get a deal, but the letter eroded the U.S.' moral authority, a key element in taking further actions, together, to force Iran back to the negotiating table.Which of the remaining P5+1 countries will agree, now, to much tougher sanctions?If this deal crumbles, the Congress can pass all the stronger sanctions it wishes, but it will be ineffective if the other members do not participate. What, then, is left? Letting Iran get a nuclear weapon that they will then be able to do quickly. It would not be the first time Republican presidents let dangerous nations acquire nuclear weapons: W in North Korea and Reagan in Pakistan. But, this really isn't, or shouldn't be, about domestic politics, it is about a nuclear arms race in the middle east. That is a national security threat worse than ISIS and al-Qaeda combined. If Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, then other mid-eastern countries will too. (Note: None of them felt they needed one when Israel developed its nuclear arsenal.)Not only have all the Republican ""hopefuls"" disqualified themselves for the presidency by usurping authority from that office, not only have they irreparably undermined the threat of future sanctions to bring Iran to the table, they have also increased the likelihood that war is the only option to prevent Iran from getting the bomb.For Republicans, this is all in a days' work."

First conceived in 1888, and formally begun in 1903, the rail line was highly controversial, and was a source of significant diplomatic friction between Germany and the other major European powers. It has been described as an important factor in precipitating the onset of World War I. When the war started, the railroad was still approximately 600 miles from its terminus. The portion from Berlin to Constantinople, however, would prove to be a key supply route for German assistance to the Ottoman Empire and played an important role in resupplying Ottoman troops during the Gallipoli campaign in the spring and summer of 1915. Construction of the final leg was not completed until July 15, 1940. The Taurus Express made the first complete journey from Istanbul to Baghdad on July 17. Baghdad Railway in Northern MesopotamiaThere is a great deal of misinformation regarding the Berlin to Baghdad railroad. First of all, the actual rail construction project was from Konya, a city in south central Turkey, to Baghdad. This was a distance of roughly one thousand miles and ran from Konya to Adana and from there to Aleppo, Mosul, and then Baghdad. Rail lines connecting Berlin with Constantinople already existed prior to the granting of the concession to build the railroad. From Aleppo, the rail line would link to an existing rail line to Damascus and from there with the Hejaz railroad to Amman and eventually Medina. A planned extension from Medina to Mecca, roughly 250 miles, was interrupted by the onset of the war. Although the gauges were not always consistent with other existing railroads in the Ottoman Empire, the Baghdad railroad would have provided the Ottomans an integrated network across the length of their empire.Ottoman Railroad Network Actual and Projected in 1914Secondly, notwithstanding its name, Baghdad was never intended to be the terminus of the proposed rail line. The intended terminus was Basra. German financial interests, led by Deutsche Bank, the main financiers of the project, intended to build a port on the Persian Gulf at the railroads terminus. The prospect of a railroad line running continuously from Berlin to the Persian Gulf and, one would surmise, a military base to defend it, was seen as an unprecedented expansion of German political, economic and military influence into the Middle East, and a direct challenge to British and Russian interests in Persia.Discovery of Oil in Persia by the Anglo Persian Oil CompanyMoreover, by the beginning of the twentieth century the growing importance of petroleum in the world economy and its prevalence in the Middle East was becoming readily apparent. British interests had begun exploring for oil in Persia in 1901. Oil was subsequently discovered there in 1908. Mesopotamia had numerous oil seeps and had been the ancient world's principal source of bitumen. The Byzantines had discovered a crude method of refining bitumen to get a more flammable distillate that they used for ""Greek fire."" Bitumen had been used for sealing boats and legend had it was the glue that had been used to cement the bricks to build the ""Tower of Babel."" Geological surveys of Mesopotamia had concluded that significant oil deposits would likely be found there but without any transportation infrastructure in place would likely be uneconomic to exploit. The ""geologists"" had been dispatched by British, French, German, and American business interests and had masqueraded as archeologists to conduct their surveys. Crude oil production had already been occurring around Basra and Mosul for several centuries. More importantly, the concession to build the Baghdad Railway had included the right to exploit any mineral deposits within a 20-kilometer swath on either side of the railway. Whoever controlled the Baghdad Railway would be in an ideal position to control the future exploitation of the Mesopotamian oil fields. Workshop Facilities During the Building of the Baghdad Railroad at Belemedik in the Taurus MountainsA rail line from central Europe through the Balkans and Anatolia to the Persian Gulf would have represented an alternative to the Suez Canal. It would have afforded Germany closer links with its colonies in East Africa and the Far East without having to rely on using the Anglo-French controlled Suez Canal or making the long sea journey around the continent of Africa. For London, a major German military presence in the Persian Gulf ""was a gun pointed at British India,"" and threatened the emerging Anglo-Russian duopoly in Persia. Basra at the Beginning of World War IBasra was poorly developed as a port as the British military discovered when they attempted to use it as the supply terminal for the Mesopotamian campaign. With German capital however, and with the prospect of significant oil discoveries along the railroad route, it would have emerged as an important, if not the dominant, financial center in the Gulf. It was British fears of German plans in the region, and the possibility that the terminus of the Berlin-Baghdad railway might extend all the way to Kuwait, (whose port facilities were better developed and which was then the dominant port in the Gulf) that had prompted Britain to extend an unofficial protectorate over Kuwait in 1899 and which it formalized in the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913. Anatolian Railway Map Showing Projected Route to KuwaitThere was one other element in the railroad concession that raised concerns in Europe's major capitals -- the so called ""kilometer guarantees."" In return for building and financing the railroad, the Ottoman government ""guaranteed"" a yearly income of 11,000 francs per kilometer of operating railway and 4,500 francs for each kilometer under construction. Under the terms of the railroad concession the Ottoman government would have had to make up any shortfall in revenues. The ""guarantees"" were seen in Paris and London as quite onerous. They could have resulted in the Ottoman government being so deeply in debt to the Baghdad Railway Company and its financial backers that it could have resulted in the eventual de facto ""takeover"" of the Ottoman Empire by German interests. At the very least, it would have placed Constantinople solidly in Berlin's political and economic orbit. Construction of a Bridge in the Taurus Mountains, Baghdad Railway 1915In the end the Berlin to Baghdad railway was not completed before the onset of World War I. Had the line from Constantinople to Baghdad been operating during the war, the Ottoman Empire might have been better able to resist the British advance during the Mesopotamian campaign. The subsequent British conquest of Mesopotamia, including the last minute seizure of Mosul, and the organization of that territory into what would eventually become the nation of Iraq might have taken a very different course. Northern Iraq might have remained part of the newly organized Turkish state, while southern Iraq might have become a separate British protectorate.

First conceived in 1888, and formally begun in 1903, the rail line was highly controversial, and was a source of significant diplomatic friction between Germany and the other major European powers. It has been described as an important factor in precipitating the onset of World War I. When the war started, the railroad was still approximately 600 miles from its terminus. The portion from Berlin to Constantinople, however, would prove to be a key supply route for German assistance to the Ottoman Empire and played an important role in resupplying Ottoman troops during the Gallipoli campaign in the spring and summer of 1915. Construction of the final leg was not completed until July 15, 1940. The Taurus Express made the first complete journey from Istanbul to Baghdad on July 17. Baghdad Railway in Northern MesopotamiaThere is a great deal of misinformation regarding the Berlin to Baghdad railroad. First of all, the actual rail construction project was from Konya, a city in south central Turkey, to Baghdad. This was a distance of roughly one thousand miles and ran from Konya to Adana and from there to Aleppo, Mosul, and then Baghdad. Rail lines connecting Berlin with Constantinople already existed prior to the granting of the concession to build the railroad. From Aleppo, the rail line would link to an existing rail line to Damascus and from there with the Hejaz railroad to Amman and eventually Medina. A planned extension from Medina to Mecca, roughly 250 miles, was interrupted by the onset of the war. Although the gauges were not always consistent with other existing railroads in the Ottoman Empire, the Baghdad railroad would have provided the Ottomans an integrated network across the length of their empire.Ottoman Railroad Network Actual and Projected in 1914Secondly, notwithstanding its name, Baghdad was never intended to be the terminus of the proposed rail line. The intended terminus was Basra. German financial interests, led by Deutsche Bank, the main financiers of the project, intended to build a port on the Persian Gulf at the railroads terminus. The prospect of a railroad line running continuously from Berlin to the Persian Gulf and, one would surmise, a military base to defend it, was seen as an unprecedented expansion of German political, economic and military influence into the Middle East, and a direct challenge to British and Russian interests in Persia.Discovery of Oil in Persia by the Anglo Persian Oil CompanyMoreover, by the beginning of the twentieth century the growing importance of petroleum in the world economy and its prevalence in the Middle East was becoming readily apparent. British interests had begun exploring for oil in Persia in 1901. Oil was subsequently discovered there in 1908. Mesopotamia had numerous oil seeps and had been the ancient world's principal source of bitumen. The Byzantines had discovered a crude method of refining bitumen to get a more flammable distillate that they used for ""Greek fire."" Bitumen had been used for sealing boats and legend had it was the glue that had been used to cement the bricks to build the ""Tower of Babel."" Geological surveys of Mesopotamia had concluded that significant oil deposits would likely be found there but without any transportation infrastructure in place would likely be uneconomic to exploit. The ""geologists"" had been dispatched by British, French, German, and American business interests and had masqueraded as archeologists to conduct their surveys. Crude oil production had already been occurring around Basra and Mosul for several centuries. More importantly, the concession to build the Baghdad Railway had included the right to exploit any mineral deposits within a 20-kilometer swath on either side of the railway. Whoever controlled the Baghdad Railway would be in an ideal position to control the future exploitation of the Mesopotamian oil fields. Workshop Facilities During the Building of the Baghdad Railroad at Belemedik in the Taurus MountainsA rail line from central Europe through the Balkans and Anatolia to the Persian Gulf would have represented an alternative to the Suez Canal. It would have afforded Germany closer links with its colonies in East Africa and the Far East without having to rely on using the Anglo-French controlled Suez Canal or making the long sea journey around the continent of Africa. For London, a major German military presence in the Persian Gulf ""was a gun pointed at British India,"" and threatened the emerging Anglo-Russian duopoly in Persia. Basra at the Beginning of World War IBasra was poorly developed as a port as the British military discovered when they attempted to use it as the supply terminal for the Mesopotamian campaign. With German capital however, and with the prospect of significant oil discoveries along the railroad route, it would have emerged as an important, if not the dominant, financial center in the Gulf. It was British fears of German plans in the region, and the possibility that the terminus of the Berlin-Baghdad railway might extend all the way to Kuwait, (whose port facilities were better developed and which was then the dominant port in the Gulf) that had prompted Britain to extend an unofficial protectorate over Kuwait in 1899 and which it formalized in the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913. Anatolian Railway Map Showing Projected Route to KuwaitThere was one other element in the railroad concession that raised concerns in Europe's major capitals -- the so called ""kilometer guarantees."" In return for building and financing the railroad, the Ottoman government ""guaranteed"" a yearly income of 11,000 francs per kilometer of operating railway and 4,500 francs for each kilometer under construction. Under the terms of the railroad concession the Ottoman government would have had to make up any shortfall in revenues. The ""guarantees"" were seen in Paris and London as quite onerous. They could have resulted in the Ottoman government being so deeply in debt to the Baghdad Railway Company and its financial backers that it could have resulted in the eventual de facto ""takeover"" of the Ottoman Empire by German interests. At the very least, it would have placed Constantinople solidly in Berlin's political and economic orbit. Construction of a Bridge in the Taurus Mountains, Baghdad Railway 1915In the end the Berlin to Baghdad railway was not completed before the onset of World War I. Had the line from Constantinople to Baghdad been operating during the war, the Ottoman Empire might have been better able to resist the British advance during the Mesopotamian campaign. The subsequent British conquest of Mesopotamia, including the last minute seizure of Mosul, and the organization of that territory into what would eventually become the nation of Iraq might have taken a very different course. Northern Iraq might have remained part of the newly organized Turkish state, while southern Iraq might have become a separate British protectorate. Either way, the subsequent history of the region might have turned out very differently, a result that reverberates even now in the twenty-first century.British Troops With Surrendering Turkish Soldiers During the Mesopotamian Campaign"

(NYC),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ed743c000066000e0010.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every election cycle can be considered, first and foremost, a monument to hype. With every passing week, the political world is a blizzard of brash predictions, bold pronouncements, and bad advice. This year, your Speculatroners shall convene every Sunday and attempt to decode and defang in a way that will hopefully leave you feeling unharmed and less confused. We hope this helps, but as always, we make no guarantees!Since the beginning of March, the singular story of our long-running pseudo-event known as the ""2016 presidential race"" has been former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her emails. This week, it became a matter which Clinton herself finally got around to addressing at a press conference, in which she explained that her decision to commingle State Department and non-State Department emails on a single email domain of her choosing was a decision borne from desired convenience, which has ended in no small amount of regret.As I noted earlier this week, one of the most interesting things about Clinton's sudden email problem is that it probably can't be solved to anyone's satisfaction. The underlying assumption is that there is some email, somewhere, that has managed to escape proper oversight. No matter how many emails Clinton discloses, if this imagined missive fails to materialize, it will always be thought of something that's being hidden, as opposed to something that does not exist. The only solution is for none of this to have happened in the first place -- and it's not as if this required some super-genius amount of foresight to prevent.Rather than solve the problem, it must simply be endured -- and not just by Clinton herself. Whatever you think of this email micro-event -- be it the intimation of a larger disorder, or one more shiny object of diminishing value -- the fact is that it has altered the ""invisible primary"" in some measurable way for Clinton's allies, her opponents, and the media tasked with covering the story. Today, we'll put everyone under the microscope -- and on the couch -- to see where this story is going, how it might end, and how everyone copes along the way. As with anything in American politics, everyone is unhappy in their own way.Democrats: Seller's anxiety, mixed with frustrationAs with any super-popular public figure, Hillary Clinton enjoys the affections of devotees for whom the mere notion that this story constitutes something scandalous is preposterous, and who are quick to point out that other current political figures (most notably GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker) have email sins of their own. Naturally, this is something of a contradictory position to take, but the underlying emotional rationale is one in which Clinton-philes feel that their candidate is uniquely persecuted. As Harry Enten reported this week over at FiveThirtyEight, Democrats in general hold the opinion that the media reserves its sharpest elbows for the former first lady:While Clinton was Secretary of State, from 2009 to early 2013, the view that the press was out to get her subsided. But since she left that office -- and its nonpartisan glow -- behind, the percentage of Democrats who see the press as being too harsh in covering Clinton has risen from 23 percent in 2013 to 54 percent in June 2014. Just 9 percent thought the media was easier on Clinton than on the average politician, according to that June poll. This 45 percentage point gap between “harder” and “easier” is similar to how Republicans felt about the press and Republican politicians, according to YouGov polls during the first half of 2014.But trends do not prove monoliths, and if you examine the way party elites and activists have responded to the email flap, you don't see a blind ""blame the press"" strategy. Instead, you see a growing demand for Clinton to just get on with her campaign already. That marks a big change from the halcyon days of late January, when everyone seemed more or less resigned to the fact that Clinton was going to afford herself ""the luxury of time"" because, as one anonymous source put it, ""She's better off as a non-candidate. Why not wait?""But if Clinton wanted some sort of well-manicured campaign rollout, it's looking more like that won't be in the cards. As Politico's Gabriel DeBenedetti reported this week:Democrats around the country had a clear and stern message for Hillary Clinton on Tuesday after she wrapped up her much-anticipated -- if hastily scheduled -- news conference on her use of a private email account as secretary of state: She shouldn’t expect this issue to go away in the coming months, and she’d better hurry up and announce her presidential campaign soon.The value of jumping into the race with both feet just as the heat from this email flap is at its height is pretty simple: You get to change the subject. You get to outline and defend policy positions and priorities, and give the teeming masses in the political media something more esoteric to chew on for a while. In short, you start playing your game. As one anonymous Democratic strategist told DeBenedetti, “When she announces that she’s running, that’s when this will fade away.”Or, so that person hopes. Let's face it, if it were a sure thing that this problem was so easily dissolved, that source would be known by name, instead of by ""a national Democratic strategist familiar with the emerging campaign structure and plans.""Of course, there's a world of Democrats outside of the Clinton fan base, including a fairly significant number of people who have dedicated their lives to convincing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to ruin her life and run for president, presumably to Clinton's left. From that camp, we've seen a trickle of reactions to this email controversy that all basically amount to, ""Why always Hillary?"" As H.A. Goodman writes in these pages, ""However, there's an alternative to constantly defending Hillary Clinton from real or fabricated accusations and controversies. Her name is Senator Elizabeth Warren."" The interesting thing to note is the way Goodman characterizes the act of righteously defending Clinton from ""fabricated accusations and controversies"" as something that's not worth the effort. The only problem, of course, is that Warren is not running, and Democrats do not have a particularly deep bench. That's why the ""crap or get off the pot"" faction is likely to get their way, pushing Clinton into proper campaign mode by April. At which point, she'll welcome the delicate knives of her rivals in the GOP.Republicans: Guarded optimism, but worried they'll blow itObviously, all of this attendant controversy has been good news for the GOP, because this story weaves well with many pre-existing media narratives (the Clintons are, by nature, secretive) and oppositional talking points (the Clintons will do anything to win). And with Clinton looming large as a near-untouchable primary contender, Republicans will take no small amount of satisfaction in the fact that she won't get through the pre-primary season unbuffeted.Nevertheless, it would appear that some sort of natural anxiety has seeped in on the Republican side, as the mouth of this irresistible gift horse clamors for gaze. As GOP strategist Ed Rogers writes in The Washington Post, ""Meanwhile, Republicans have reacted in a somewhat bipolar fashion. They’ve sloshed from, 'Oh no, Hillary Clinton is invincible' to 'Oh no, Hillary Clinton might not be the Democratic nominee in 2016.'”Is it possible that after all of this, Republicans would rather run against Hillary Clinton than someone else? That would evince far more confidence in the Democrats' second string than even the Democrats have mustered at this point. And yet, you can find people sharing these sentiments. Over at American Thinker, J. Robert Smith says that the question, ""Would our party nominee be better off with Hillary or another Democrat?"" is ""more than an arm-chair debate"":RINO election strategies failed in 2008 and 2012. What critical constituencies do the McConnell-Boehner led GOP congressional majorities persuade or excite? Where are congressional Republicans advancing better approaches to the nation’s challenges? Boehner and McConnell capitulations on critical issues don’t exactly motive base conservatives or make Republicans standout. Obviously, most of that is predicated on a broad critique of ""establishment Republicans"" and some ostentatious assumptions about ""the left"" being engaged in a process to ensure Hillary doesn't run, but there is a danger, at least in theory, in the ""candidate to be named later."" And with current opinion polls telling our media that the people are hot for change, there's something reassuring about fighting Hillary Clinton in a general election when you presume she won't be able to embody something ""new"" in fitting enough fashion.Elsewhere, there is the notion that somehow, the GOP will blow this. Clinton's ""foes,"" writes Time magazine's David Von Drehle, ""almost always overplay their hand"":Though members of Congress are calling for her to turn over the email server for forensic examination, they would be wise to proceed cautiously. A key page in the Clinton rule book is the one that reads: When in doubt, drive your enemies crazy -- then sit back and watch them implode.The whole notion of the GOP always shooting themselves in the foot when they've got a clear sight at the target naturally comes in for some mockery in some circles. And yet, over in Politico Magazine, feisty GOP flack Rick Wilson makes it clear that this is one of his chief worries, urging Republicans to ""stay out of the way of [Clinton's] email fiasco"":Let’s try something new: maintain message discipline, hold focus and keep an eye on a bigger objective than your daily press release, social media hits or email fundraising drops. This is about her, not us, so unless GOP elected and opinion leaders are smart and subtle, and execute with the right timing and tone, she wins. Try for once to play the long game and help Hillary Clinton take on water.Of course, ""never interrupt your opponent when they're making a mistake"" is, in American politics, advice that is offered almost as often as it goes unheeded. But it goes to show that old GOP hands know this ""overplay the hand"" tendency well enough.Of course, the main target of Wilson's piece may not be Republicans at all, but rather the media.The Media: One nation under a backlash""While the media’s passive 'attention span' excuse du jour is real,"" Wilson writes, ""many in the press are possessed of a boundless ideological desire to change the subject right now.""There's scant evidence that this notion is true. The political press seems rather united on the notion that Clinton's press conference failed to end the story and continued to raise concerns. As of now, The Associated Press and Gawker have filed separate lawsuits against the State Department to gain access to Clinton's missing emails. Every indication is that this story shall persist for some time.Still, it's a pretty nifty bit of ""working the refs"" from Wilson, and it neatly encapsulates the delicate position the press is in. If media outlets run at the story with the willy-nilly spirit of their typical foolishness, they could end up resembling the very creatures that Harry Enten's poll respondents imagine -- wild-eyed gaffe patrols eternally chasing after the shiny object. Give up on the story too soon, and they'll become another caricature: the in-the-tank liberal media. (And even though this story wouldn't exist without determined reporting, you can bet that if the flap ends up not hurting Clinton, the press will be accused of ""burying the story."") Either way you turn, backlash looms.Meanwhile, it's anybody's guess as to whether the people pursuing this story are doing so with any mind to what they should even be looking for, exactly. Time's Von Drehle pinpoints one area of interest, the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Per Von Drehle:The risk that foreign governments and superrich foreign citizens might donate to the foundation as a way of currying favor with the Secretary of State worried both Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Hillary Clinton was first named Obama’s top diplomat. And while the White House forced the foundation to sign a point-by-point agreement in 2008 about what it could and could not do while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department, there really is no separating the globe-trotting Clintons from the heady atmosphere of money and influence.Still, it's not clear that everyone's wading into this story with a solid game plan. The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza says that he's ""stuck on"" the number of emails deemed private, and indeed, he offers no indication as to whether he's considered the distinction between quality and quantity. CNN's Laura Koran made a game attempt to illustrate what a pending release of Clinton emails might ""look like,"" but never really gets past what's likely to be excluded from such a release to reckon with what might be there.And the answer, of course, is that there may be nothing extraordinary in those emails at all. Of course, there could also be any number of embarrassments -- intemperate remarks, unexpected criticism, blunt analysis -- that might be dredged from Clinton's emails, as might be dredged from our own. So the story could just as easily end up in ""What about your gaffes?"" territory as it might end up exposing some dodgy synergy between Clinton's State Department office and her family's foundation.Of course, there's something to this whole story that does speak to the public interest. As Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel opinion columnist Ernst-Ulrich Franzen notes, there's a wider, better debate to be had:The fact of the matter is that operating in secret is the preferred method of operation for too many elected officials on both aides of the aisle. The Obama administration has become notorious for its foot-dragging and reluctance to operate under public scrutiny. And while Walker has been better than many when it comes to openness and in responding to the media, the secret email system and his unwillingness in recent weeks to directly answer some questions, still leaves a bad taste. Just as Clinton's practice does.Cheers to Franzen for making the effort to elevate the conversation. Also, please accept these commiserations when this substantive conversation fails to materialize.Hillary Clinton: Is it all really worth it?And what of Clinton herself? The events of the last two weeks have raised a slew of old questions. Frank Rich took to his regular New York Magazine Q&A column to lament, ""But the more important question is why the Clintons, who more than anyone in American politics understand the high risks of perceived improprieties, have left Hillary’s campaign so vulnerable even before it is officially out of the gate."" These concerns were echoed by The Guardian's Megan Carpentier:But the stupidest person in all of this whole mess is Hillary Clinton, who –- when she set up her private email address in 2009, just after leaving the Senate and just before heading into her confirmation hearing as Secretary of State -– had already weathered approximately 20 years and infinite variations on this exact stupidity about her supposedly letter-but-not spirit-of-the-law behavior and public transparency and yet set up a private email address and used it for work email anyway.Meanwhile, Rich's New York Magazine colleague Jonathan Chait says that the ""larger problem for Clinton, though, is not the likelihood that her emails will turn up incriminating evidence."" Rather it is ""what this episode reveals about her political judgment and managerial acumen.""All of which may be overcomplicating the problem. A more fitting question might be: ""Does Hillary Clinton actually want to do this for the next year and a half?"" Based upon how little she enjoyed her first tilt with a skeptical press, you have to think that going on for hundreds of days more will require a stouter resolve than most masochists are prepared to offer.The pundit class, at the moment, is hung up on the public's desire for novelty and change, because it looks like there's a better-than-even chance that both parties' nominees might end up being dynastic throwbacks. But all of that may be a mere placeholder for public opinion, until the sparring begins and the public gains a firmer foothold into what the big ideas of the 2016 race might end up being. Nevertheless, even if a lack of dynamic newness isn't a barrier to competing for the White House, a lack of optimism almost certainly is. And that's what's missing from Hillary Clinton's outward-facing campaign, such as it is at the moment: any sign of brightness or buoyancy, or the notion that there is something hopeful, energizing the Clinton candidacy with purpose. Inevitability -- that quality that Clinton is said to have in abundance -- doesn't mean much when it seems as if what's inevitable isn't any fun.Somehow, some way, Hillary Clinton is going to have to find some way of proceeding on this path with something that resembles cheerfulness, and which presents a Clinton candidacy as an exuberant, positive thing in which to play a part. It can't look like a constant slog of pessimism and recriminations, otherwise the feeling expressed by H.A. Goodman, in which defending Clinton is a drudge even when the cause is right, will become widespread.Clinton's been at this for a long while now, and while during that time, she's come to be thought of as having presidential timber, she's also managed to acquire a few decades of resentments, which she seems to keep too close at hand for her own good. Now, she's got to find a way to legitimately enjoy running for president. That probably means that she's got to somehow put these ancient grievances out of her mind, lest she be consumed by them. If only she could delete them as easily as an email.Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?"
9,WORLDPOST,What You Need To Know About The Iran Nuclear Negotiations,Eline Gordts,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran-nuclear-negotiations_n_6864584.html,,2015-03-14,"Secretary of State John Kerry gestures during a news conference after he delivered remarks to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Monday, March 2, 2015, in Geneva. Kerry discussed ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran, and tensions with Russia over Ukraine. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc147112400003200382a6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Ali Vaez about the nuclear negotiations with Iran.International negotiators in Geneva have just over two weeks left to bring years of talks between Iran and six world powers to fruition by reaching a framework for an agreement on Iran's nuclear program.Representatives of Iran and the so-called P5+1 group -- the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany -- have set a March 31 deadline to reach a basic understanding for a nuclear deal. The parties then have until the end of June to hammer out the remaining details. The talks stem from international powers' concern that Iran is using its nuclear enrichment program to build a nuclear weapon. Iran insists the program is only for peaceful purposes. The WorldPost spoke with Ali Vaez, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst on Iran, about the ongoing talks. What do Iran and the world powers aim to accomplish with this agreement?Iran's nuclear program has been under international scrutiny for the past twelve years and has resulted in an international standoff between Iran and the West. The primary goal from the Iranian side is to normalize the nuclear program. The second goal is to make sure the sanctions that have been imposed on Iran as a result of the nuclear program are lifted. The P5+1 group wants to make sure that Iran’s nuclear activities are purely peaceful and that there is no nuclear material and activity in Iran that could be diverted towards nuclear proliferation and weaponization. In November 2013, the two sides took a first step in a very long journey towards their ultimate goals. The first-phase agreement froze some of the most sensitive nuclear activities Iran was conducting at the time, in return for limited and reversible sanctions relief. In the current negotiations, Iran wants a more permanent form of sanctions relief. In addition to suspending some of its nuclear activities, the P5+1 wants Iran to roll those activities back and also accept and implement monitoring mechanisms that would allow inspectors much better access to verify the peaceful nature of the nuclear program. What is on the table today?Since the talks are still ongoing, it's difficult to talk about the details of the agreement with a high degree of certainty. But the contours of a possible agreement are more or less clear. What we know is that Iran will roll back its enrichment activities -- the process that is used to enrich uranium to be used in nuclear power reactors or in a nuclear weapon. Iran will reduce the number of centrifuges that it currently has installed from about 20,000 to a number between 6,000 and 8,000, and it will also reduce its current stockpile of enriched uranium from about 8,000 kg to something below 1,000. Those moves will increase the time that Iran would need to produce the material needed for a nuclear weapon from about three months to 12 months.In return, sanctions that have been imposed on Iran as a result of its nuclear program are going to be lifted in a phased and incremental manner. Most likely, Iran's actions are going to be pegged to sanctions relief, meaning that Iran would take some specific measures and in return some specific sanctions would be lifted. Iran will also accept the most rigorous monitoring mechanism that has ever been implemented on a nuclear program in the world. Do you consider this a ""good"" deal?Good means different things to different people, but we should realize that diplomacy by nature does not produce perfect outcomes because both sides have to compromise. We should compare the agreement to its alternatives, and the reality is that what is currently being negotiated will virtually block all of Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon. In that sense I think it is a good deal. It does not totally eliminate the risk, but it diminishes it really significantly. We should compare it to the alternative: no deal at all. With a deal, Iran will roll back its enrichment capacity. Without a deal, the capacity will be jacked up and the time Iran needs to produce the material for a nuclear weapon will be reduced to maybe just a few weeks. The inspection mechanisms that are currently in place will be much less intrusive than in the case of a deal, and the stockpile of enriched material that Iran has access to will grow instead of being reduced. Without a deal, Iran keeps its heavy water reactor that produces enough plutonium for one nuclear weapon per year, and there's a risk that it could use the plutonium parts for nuclear weapons. With a deal, that reactor is going to be converted and it will produce less than a kilogram of plutonium per year, which means it would take Iran eight years to accumulate enough material for a nuclear weapon. From an Iranian perspective, with a deal, Iran will not only have sanctions relief but will be able to find its way back to the international market. Without a deal, Iran will be isolated, sanctions will probably increase and we will get into a spiral of escalation on both sides that could lead to military confrontation. How are the negotiations perceived in Iran?With 80 million people, Iran is a big country and it is very pluralistic. There’s a broad spectrum of reactions. Some are extremely critical of the approach that the current Iranian negotiating team has adopted. Others are very supportive. There's a small but very vocal group of hard-liners that would like to see the talks derailed. But overall, there's a sense of fatigue within the Iranian population after years of economic hardship and isolation. As was demonstrated in the presidential elections of 2013 that brought President Hassan Rouhani to power, the majority of the Iranian people want this issue to be resolved. There's broad-based support within the population and within the media. The political elite is also quite supportive. Did the letter sent by 47 Republican U.S. senators warning Tehran that the next president could revoke any agreement reached by the current White House affect Iranians' perception of the negotiations?The letter was obviously designed to sabotage the talks by dissuading the Iranians from making any concessions. Monitoring the Iranian media and reactions from Iranian officials so far, it appears the letter has missed its target. First of all, it doesn’t come as a surprise to the Iranians -- they already knew that Congress is not going to cooperate with the White House on this subject. This was also calculated into their negotiation strategy. Some of the measures that Iran is going to accept are bound to the U.S. government taking sanctions legislation to Congress. So if Congress fails to lift the sanctions, the Iranians will also renege on their end of the bargain.The Iranians also insisted to focus on U.N. sanctions instead of unilateral U.S. sanctions, because the U.N. sanctions formed the basis of legitimacy of all the unilateral sanctions. Even if the next U.S. president revokes the deal, the U.S. would have a much harder time bringing international support for enforcing the sanctions without a U.N. mandate. The Iranians require the U.N. sanctions to be lifted in the early stages of the agreement. The Republicans weren't the only one to criticize the negotiations this month. In a speech to Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made his case for why he considers the agreement ""a bad deal."" Did Netanyahu's speech come as a surprise to Tehran?I think this level of politicization of the issue was quite surprising to the Iranians. The circumstances surrounding the speech turned the Iranian nuclear program, for the first time, into a partisan issue. But at the end of the day, Tehran knew that Prime Minister Netanyahu’s problems with the Iran deal are not about Iran enriching uranium but about Iran being enriched by any deal. The speech alienated a lot of Democrats, and that inadvertently backfired on Prime Minister Netanyahu and his Republican allies in Congress, because now it’s much harder for them to push for legislation to block the agreement -- they simply lack a veto-proof majority in the Senate. So even though the speech was very powerful, it made the Israeli prime minister and the Republicans be seen internationally as pursuing maximalist demands aimed at derailing the negotiations. The Democratic support that was there -- before the speech and before the letter -- to put more pressure on Iran evaporated.Do you think the negotiators will be able to come to an agreement?I'm cautiously optimistic. I think the chances have significantly improved over the past few weeks because the talks have made significant progress on the most intractable issue in these negotiations: the problem with enrichment capacity.

The split was even immortalized onscreen in the 2012 documentary, ""Katy Perry: Part of Me,"" which featured Perry's tearful postmortem on their union.""If you can believe in something great, I feel like you can achieve something great,"" Perry said in the film. ""I have that same belief system with everything, from career to my life to my personal life, everything. And I will do everything it takes to not fail. And I did everything it took, but it still failed.""Three years after that movie, the Brand-Perry relationship is back onscreen, albeit briefly. The couple are shown together in ""BRAND: A Second Coming,"" a new documentary which had its world premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival on Friday night.While ""BRAND"" is much more concerned with its title subject, Perry's presence is unavoidable. In fact, it's while Brand is married to Perry that he has a sudden epiphany about fame and his place in the world. The comedian is shown visiting Nairobi, where children are digging through a garbage dump loaded with hypodermic needles and other dangerous refuse; the footage is then juxtaposed with Brand discussing a lavish party he attended with Perry. It's a turning point that pushes Brand away from his ascension up the Hollywood ladder and toward his current place in the lexicon as a political activist.The film also includes an interview Brand conducted with Perry while they were married, where the singer expresses some trepidation about their relationship (she tells a story about how the Buddha left his wife to search for enlightenment). But Perry says she ""picked"" Brand because of how his intelligence made her look. The camera remains on after their chat ends, and Perry stages a faux tantrum while Brand playfully admonishes for pretending to break their possessions. ""I control the pussy,"" she jokes to someone off-camera. (A representative for Perry did not respond to request for comment when contacted by The Huffington Post.)Brand has frequently said he enjoyed being married to Perry (""I really enjoyed it,"" he said last year), and while ""BRAND"" doesn't dwell on their relationship too much, it does include one piece of the comic's philosophy on human connections.""I cut people out of my life if I think things aren't functioning,"" Brand says over footage of the 39-year-old visiting his grandmother's gravesite with his father. ""And I think, 'What am I making this effort for?'""Brand did not attend the debut screening of ""BRAND: A Second Coming,"" announcing on Friday that he was ""very uncomfortable"" watching the film. Neither SXSW Film organizers nor ""BRAND"" director Ondi Timoner knew of Brand's decision until hours before the premiere.This year's South by Southwest Film Festival runs from March 13 until March 21."

It happened to be a year in which no top seed made the Final Four. He also assigned more value to picks in the later rounds.For his informal study, Kwak invited 200 Michigan students and alumni to fill out brackets to the best of their ability while he picked winners for three separate bracket sheets based on coin flips. The coin-flip brackets outperformed the average score of the participants, he found.What do others make of the theory? One mathematician said sports knowledge can provide an edge. Dr. Jordan Ellenberg, a math professor at the University of Wisconsin, pointed to a coin-flip statistic for last year's tournament that he said showed ""coin-flip brackets do REALLY REALLY BADLY relative to the median ESPN Tournament Challenge player, who is presumably using their basketball knowledge and trying to win.""The bottom line? Knowledgeable or not, players have a tough time achieving a high rate of accuracy. Despite Warren Buffett's $1 billion prize to anyone who could correctly pick all 63 games last year, the best player in the ESPN pools fell 18 games short, according to Michigan News.But that won't stop millions from coming back for more.Another study by Kwak, ""The Overestimation Phenomenon in a Skill-Based Gaming Context: The Case of March Madness Pools,""  was recently published in the Journal of Gambling Studies. It explains why we're such gluttons for March Madness punishment.Gamblers who expressed high confidence in their bracket success performed the same on average as those expressing low confidence, Kwak said, but it was the self-assurance that kept them betting year after year.""We found confidence to be the strongest predictor of enjoyment,"" he told HuffPost Science. ""This winning confidence brings them back.""  "

Go ahead and giggle if you want at the funny-looking blimp, but its purpose is no laughing matter. Altaeros Energies' Buoyant Airborne Turbine (BAT) is designed to go where no wind turbine has gone before: up to 2,000 feet in the air, where it can capture steady winds, turn them into electricity, and transmit power to the ground.Why would anyone bother to float a wind turbine? Because it can be easily deployed in temporary workplaces, disaster zones, or any location where power generation isn't readily available or would be prohibitively expensive to install. And there's wind everywhere on the planet.The BAT consists of a industrial fabric shell that's filled with 1,000 cubic meters of helium, a lightweight conventional three-blade wind turbine, high-strength tethers to hold it the turbine in place no matter the conditions (one tether contains copper wire to send the juice down to a battery), and a portable ground station the size of a shipping container that can be transported by truck. Four fins help keep it stable as it floats.But the BAT is more than just a giant balloon on a string. The shell can also act as a platform for communication devices or sensor equipment. The turbine can work even at ground level. And the robotic tether control can automate its winches to adjust altitude and improve stability for optimal energy output. The power the BAT produces is conditioned on the ground station before it's sent to the grid.The initial version of the BAT holds a 30-kilowatt turbine strong enough to power only about a dozen homes, but larger prototypes will carry a 200-kilowatt turbine. Both are designed to work optimally in 30 mph winds, but they can stay aloft until wind speed surpasses 75 mph.Altaeros notes that the BAT is all about logistical ease, bringing power to places that have lost it, have never had it, or need it only on a temporary basis. The company isn't competing with permanently installed wind turbines; rather, it sees its main competition as the diesel generator. The idea has proved attractive enough to land a $7 million investment from Japan's Softbank and a $1.3 million grant from the Alaska Energy Authority to test the technology. It makes sense, since high-latitude locales where solar energy works well for just half the year could make ideal BAT sites. The first commercial Altaeros launch will take place this year in Fairbanks, Alaska, where even the small version of the turbine may compensate for 11,000 gallons of diesel fuel annually.If that installation proves successful, it's a small leap to the bigger turbine, which could find use at large construction sites that rely on huge generators today or to offshore locations where it would be far less expensive to deploy than traditional turbines. No matter how you look at it, the future of alternative energy is up in the air.Visit XPRIZE at xprize.org, follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+, and get our newsletter to stay informed."

We therefore need to find a way within the eurozone, but this way cannot be that the Greeks keep on having to pay,"" he said, according to an advance extract of the broad-ranging interview.He also said Greece did not need a third bailout but rather ""a haircut like the one Germany also got in 1953 at the London debt conference.""Athens and Berlin have become engaged in a war of words and Greece has submitted a formal protest to the German Foreign Ministry, accusing Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble of having insulted his Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis.

We would no longer be obliged to take in refugees as a country of arrival.

There are ways to get rid of me as mayor,"" Knowles said in an interview with National Public Radio.Knowles, whose job as mayor is part-time, told NPR, ""I'm giving it every last measure at this point and I will continue to do so, as long as the citizens will have me.""In Thursday's shooting, a 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound and a 32-year-old colleague from a nearby police department sustained a facial wound that left a bullet lodged near his ear.

The river sustains lush forests with rare elephant, tiger and crocodile species. The Chong people fish, grow rice, and gather roots and mushrooms on the river banks. They say that piles of money could not replace their river if it were destroyed by a dam. The Chong people are not alone in revering their river. We call our rivers Father Rhine and Mother Ganges. The Mekong, Nile and Zambezi are venerated as Rivers of Life. In India, rivers like the Yamuna and Narmada are worshipped as goddesses. Rivers feed us, connect us, and give us a sense of identity. This is why we celebrate them with an International Day of Action for Rivers on March 14 every year.Scientists confirm what our ancestors knew from experience. Rivers connect land, freshwater and marine ecosystems. They host some of the world's most diverse plant and animal communities. Rivers sustain much of our agriculture, and their fisheries nourish millions. Their sediments protect our coastlines against erosion by the sea, and pull carbon out of the atmosphere. Healthy rivers act as natural buffers that balance ever more serious floods and droughts. We often ignore that we depend on rivers for our long-term prosperity. We are damming them, polluting them and sucking them dry. Some rivers don't even reach the sea anymore. Between 10,000 and 20,000 freshwater species are at risk of extinction or have already died out. Because their migration routes have been cut, the survival of 24 of the world's 26 majestic sturgeon species is threatened or near-threatened.Rivers and other wetlands are more strongly affected by the loss of species than any other major ecosystem. Even so, they are currently faced by a dam-building boom of unprecedented proportions. No less than 3,700 hydropower dams are under construction or in the pipeline right now around the world. They include the Stung Cheay Areng Dam on Cambodia's sacred Areng River.From the Amazon to the Mekong, from the Himalayas to the Nile, from the Balkans to the Andes, civil society networks have sprung up to defend the arteries of our planet. They bring together farmers and fisher folk, activists and teachers, rafters and lawyers, scientists and poets. They speak up for local livelihoods, analyze project documents, block construction sites, and hold decision-makers to account. Working with activists and monks, the people of the Areng Valley have organized protests, blocked dam builders from entering their territory, and raised their concerns in the international media.Today, on March 14, more than 120 groups in at least 38 countries again pay their respects on the International Day of Action for Rivers. They are holding protest rallies and workshops. They are organizing writing contests and dance performances. They are marching along rivers and holding kayak races. They are cleaning up rivers and occupying the offices of dam builders. They are joining hands under the motto, #RiversUniteUs.On this day, we also celebrate the successes that our network has achieved. Together with local communities and partner NGOs, we have stopped destructive projects in Burma, Chile, China, Namibia, Peru, Thailand and many other countries. We have supported indigenous communities in Brazil, Guatemala, India, Malaysia and Panama in the struggle for their ancestral lands. We have informed dam builders from North and South that they will risk their bottom lines and reputations by building destructive dams. We have put the importance of rivers on the global agenda.The people of the Areng Valley have so far managed to keep the dam builders at bay. Two Chinese companies have already withdrawn from the project. In late February, Cambodia's Prime Minister announced that dam construction would not start until at least 2018. Yet the pressure continues, and the Chong people deserve our continued support. Please take a moment to think about what you can do to protect the arteries of our planet. We can all avoid products that waste and pollute valuable water. We can educate our children about a way of life that respects the ecosystems of our planet. We can raise our voices and cast our votes to support the protection of the environment. We can get engaged in local watershed groups and support organizations like International Rivers. Because, after all, rivers are in our hands. Thank you for your support."

(AP Photo/LM Otero)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ed7b2400003100577984.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- School discipline reforms in Texas have helped reduce the number of students charged with crimes for misbehaving in school by as much as 80 percent in just one year, according to data released this month by the Texas Judicial Branch. The reforms, two bills passed by the state legislature in 2013, address soaring numbers of students charged with crimes by school police officers, often for minor disciplinary infractions. ""We were seeing a huge number of kids who were getting tickets from school police officers for really low-level misbehavior that used to be handled with a trip to the principal's office,"" said Deborah Fowler, executive director of the youth advocacy group Texas Appleseed. ""Things like chewing gum in class, falling asleep in class, and talking too loudly.""The charges come with a mandatory appearance in adult court. Punishment often includes a $500 fine.""In Texas, all our juvenile Class C misdemeanor cases go to adult criminal courts. They do not go to juvenile court,"" Fowler told The Huffington Post. Because the students weren't charged with serious crimes, the state typically did not supply lawyers, and most pleaded guilty. ""It's incredibly rare to see a child without counsel plead not guilty,"" said Fowler. In 2013, the state legislature passed two bills: The first curbed tickets for students on school campuses for anything except traffic violations. The second eliminated two categories of offenses that were previously punishable with misdemeanor tickets: ""disruption of class"" and ""disruption of transportation."" Now, as long as a student is at his or her own school, they cannot receive a ticket for disrupting class. During the 2013-2014 school year, the first year of the new rules, violations of the education code -- the two ""disruption"" offenses -- dropped nearly 83 percent, while ticketing for all other offenses in school, including disorderly conduct, fell by a total of 58 percent. Meanwhile, many of the potential negative consequences that opponents of reform feared never came to pass, Fowler said. ""There was a lot of fear that schools would be unsafe, and that you'd see a lot more kids arrested and charged with a higher-level offense because officers couldn't ticket anymore,"" said Fowler. ""But that's not what we've seen. In 2014, the juvenile arrest rates continued to decline. We're just not seeing the negative impacts that people were so concerned about."" The push for the reforms created an unusual coalition of conservative groups and progressives. The right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation was active in pushing for the changes.""What conservatives and liberals alike realized was that if we wanted to fix a problem, we needed to try something that would actually help to remedy it,"" said Derek Cohen, a policy analyst at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. ""The only people who benefited from the [Class C misdemeanor ticketing system] were the people who could actually issue [the tickets] and not have to worry about any more punishment,"" he said. Cohen said the staggering drop in ticketing shows that while ""misbehavior is still specific to the kid, how we handle that is specific to the administrator and the administrations. At the end of the day, the people whose decisions can really drive these numbers one way or another, I think they're seeing that there's a better way."" Even as advocates point to the effectiveness of the reforms, they say the state still has a major legal feature keeping students in the so called school-to-prison pipeline: In Texas, truancy is a crime. In a report published this month by Texas Appleseed, Nathan Hecht, chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court, added his influential voice to a growing choir of advocates and legal scholars who say it's time for Texas to reconsider policies that criminalize absenteeism. While truancy and attendance laws are meant to help keep kids in school, Hecht writes, they often have the opposite effect. ""The theory is that the threat of punishment will incentivize attendance. But when almost 100,000 criminal truancy charges are brought each year against Texas schoolchildren, one has to think, this approach may not be working.""Like the school ticketing reforms, both Fowler and Cohen are looking to reform truancy policies, and reduce the number of students ticketed for Failure to Attend School violations. Last year, even as the disciplinary tickets dropped sharply, more than 63,000 students were charged with misdemeanors for missing school."

And yet they seem to pop up everywhere: in the airplane seat in front of you, in the line at the market, in the parking lot, in the workplace, on blogs, and certainly in the halls of Congress.In fact, it may be that we're all more abrasive than we used to be. A 2014 poll by Weber Shandwick and Powell Tate in partnership with KRC Research found that most people think America has a raging civility problem. Blame for that differs across generations. Millennials and Gen-Xers say it's the Internet and social media. Boomers and older blame the tone set by politicians. Most think incivility will get worse. Millennials -- starry-eyed bunch that they are -- think it might get better. But only a little bit.This onslaught of incivility is undoubtedly a crackling current through emotional wiring that's already there. In other words it's in our genes. Research generally agrees on five big personality traits, known as the OCEAN model. We are all constructed of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (or emotional instability).Abrasive people light up the board most consistently in agreeableness. Agreeable people are friendly, kind, trusting, and helpful. Disagreeable people think agreeable people are a joke. If the most agreeable people live in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood. The most disagreeable people would let it burn down. They don't care about the well-being of others. They don't tend to go out of their way to help others and they don't particularly care about being liked. One big pulsing vein in their abrasiveness is their lack of trust in human nature, to be on the safe side: ""Do unto others before they do unto you.""And yet their callous disregard for the feelings of others is often a hallmark of highly successful people. (Also serial killers.) And, it turns out, the not-so-well. An analysis of dozens of studies published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology showed a direct link between anger, hostility and heart problems. But a study in the Journal Social Psychological and Personality Science found that the ruder or more disrespectful someone acts, the more he's able to convince everyone around him that he's powerful -- and above the rules. In that way, abrasive people may command more respect, even if it's largely grounded in fear. It just might be all in our head, and abrasiveness is pure perception. In a July report for Fortune.com, linguist Kieran Snyder collected nearly 250 performance reviews from nearly 30 tech companies to look at whether the notion that a woman is abrasive undermines her career in technology. Indeed, Snyder found that although the word ""abrasive"" never appeared in any of the men's reviews, it was used 17 times to describe 13 different women. While the critical feedback men received was mostly constructive, similar feedback delivered to women was largely personal. Either way, you know what research has also proven? That kindness has a place. Which may be why companies spend more on smoothing down executive abrasiveness than on any other failing. The lesson? The best way to deal with the rude and the hostile isn't to become one of them. Instead, try creating a few rules of engagement. Like asking them to repeat that insulting thing they just said because you want to make sure you understand. And refusing to put aggravating conversations on your personal replay loop. As millions of four-years-olds now say, let it go. After all, if somebody in an abusive situation has to be upset, why should it be you? And if you're ever in doubt when dealing with a difficult personality (or perhaps being one yourself) remember that when there's no urgent reason not to be nice, be nice. It's pretty easy once you get the hang of it."

He said that, ""If you are considered 'the absolute best,' you spend too much time thinking about your ranking and not enough about the skills that got you there. What I want to be is 'one of the best.'""A great philosophy. I have not seen Nick in many years and I doubt he would remember that casual conversation. He had a defective rifle blow up in his hand and received a multimillion dollar verdict. Nick didn't use the money on a fancy house or a new Rolls Royce; he set up a charity designed to help young people in disadvantaged communities. He served on the Kentucky Supreme Court and got away from trial. But he gave me a thought that has dominated my thinking for the past 30 years. What makes a high achiever different from someone who plods through life? Being the Friend of a High Achiever ""When you know that you've got a real friend somewhere Suddenly all the others are so much easier to bear"" -- Jackson Browne Almost all of my closest friends are high achievers in some aspect of their life. My father had the same dynamic. My father was a Cincinnati area bookie with a 10th grade education, but when he died, the church was filled with super successful, and many locally famous, people. Some did business with him. Some did not. There is an excitement and energy of being with people who are confident about who they are and enthused about what they do. It is fun. They take you to the next level with them. The first thing high achievers understand is that time is their most valuable asset, and they are not willing to waste it. It's tough to get them to give their time to someone. It's even tougher to be someone they give that time to. I am Chairman of RRP International Publishing, which is releasing Dr. Jim Roach's book, God's House Calls: Finding God Through My Patients, on March 31. Jim is universally considered ""one of the best"" Integrative Medicine physicians in the world. He manages every minute of his day well. Jack Canfield, author of Chicken Soup for the Soul, said about Dr. Jim: ""You are the most encyclopedic man I have ever met. They should take your brain and put it in the Smithsonian if and when you ever die."" As we finish the book, I interact with Dr. Jim multiple times a day. He has become a very close friend. I've lost 75 pounds since November and I no longer have diabetes or take medicine for it. During my daily interactions, Jim has given me terrific advice and oversees my path to health. I also can pinpoint exactly at what time of the day Dr. Jim is going to contact me. I can tell you when he is spending time with patients, when he is on one of his (twice a day) walks, when he is doing research, when he is at a church activity and when he blocks off time for his family. He rarely deviates and plots his schedule carefully. Actually, he doesn't really plot the schedule. His habits are so ingrained that they just happen. He's lived in the small city of Midway, Kentucky, where he literally knows everyone, for most of his life. He's been happily married to Dee Dee since 1976. They work together and they do their walk together every night. Dr. Jim seems to literally know everyone, but his true inner circle is tight and dominated by his family. His closest, lifelong friend is a janitor. They know everything about each other and have the kind of deep friendship and trust that takes a lifetime to build.As I look at high achievers in every field, the concept of a tight circle of friends comes up over and over again. Johnny Bench and his Inner Circle My father was a friend of baseball Hall of Famer Johnny Bench. Bench was not ""one of the best."" He is without question the greatest baseball catcher who ever lived.Bench had all the potential ""friends"" that you could ever dream of, but I suspect that the reason that Bench has had such a successful post-baseball life is that he kept his inner circle very small. Life Lessons from the Lottery, a book I wrote in 2012, cites a number of reasons why sports stars run through their money within five years after retirement. Not Johnny Bench. He never acquired ""the posse"" that caused people like Allen Iverson or Lenny Dykstra to run through millions of dollars. Bench did not play at a time when players received $100 million contracts, but seems to be doing just fine. He had perspective and balance. He stayed very close to his parents, who I got to know, and his mom and dad were not shy about helping their superstar son keep his ego in check. I saw Johnny's dad every month. Every time, Mr. Bench would get on me about the junk food I ate. If I had listened to him then, I might not have needed Dr. Jim 40 years later. Also, the guys that Bench befriended were top achievers themselves. They were local versions of Johnny Bench in their respective professions. Roger Kahn captured many of their personalities in his great book, A Season in the Sun. The dapper ""Cadillac"" Charlie Shanks was a high powered engineer with General Motors. ""The Music Professor"" Jim LaBarbara was a Hall of Fame radio personality. Jim ""Squirrel"" Stadtmiller was the top broadcasting sales guy in Cincinnati. Jeff Ruby became a Cincinnati legend in the restaurant business, and Burch Riber was a genius at bringing big time LPGA and PGA golf tournaments to Cincinnati. Dr. Luis Gonzalez was a world famous surgeon who operated on Johnny when he had a spot on his lung. Princes of the city. They were not economically dependent on Bench, and Bench was not dependent on them. The connection was true friendship. Bench showed that friendship and loyalty were badges of honor to him. Also, he had a sign of a strong sense of survival. Pete Rose is one of the most accessible superstars you will ever meet. His inner circle was more like a baseball arena. It got filled with bad people with bad motives, who became part of the reason that Pete lost everything. Go back to when Pete got in trouble with gambling and the users, suck ups and rats had a lot to do with it. Add in the enablers. The group of ""friends"" who kept encouraging him to lie rather than coming clean. Pete has repented now and understood that he really screwed up. It's time for baseball to grant forgiveness, but I suspect that if Pete had a small and solid core like Johnny did, he would have avoided all trouble to begin with. The rap on Johnny was that he was aloof and hard to get to know. The men in his inner circle would say just the opposite. He was shy, but careful. ""Big Joe"" McNay befriended Johnny when Johnny was 18 and just made it to Cincinnati. Dad seemed to be the father figure, or at least the big brother, to guys like Bench, Squirrel and Jeff Ruby, who were about 15 years younger. It would have been easy, and in fact practical, for a guy like Bench to ditch Dad and ""trade up"" to a different group of friends once Johnny became famous. It never happened. Johnny was a friend, not a client of Dad's, but having a professional gambler in an athlete's inner circle would be impossible in the Facebook and YouTube era. Even 40 years ago, it would have been simpler for Johnny to move on. Instead, I credit him for giving Dad his last month of life. In January 1993, I thought Dad had reached his last day. His prostate cancer had spread all over his body and he was in unbearable pain. You could literally hear the tumors breaking the bones in his ribs on about an hourly basis. Suddenly, Dad got a call from Johnny Bench. Bench found out about Dad's cancer while playing in the Bob Hope Desert Classic, a big PGA golf tournament in Palm Springs, CA. When he got the news, Bench borrowed his playing partner Donald Trump's cell phone (cell phones were not common in 1992) and called Dad from right in the middle of the golf course in the middle of a PGA event. I have not seen Johnny since Dad died, but when I do I am going to thank him for giving Dad another month of life. The call from Bench literally brought Dad back from the dead. He was so psyched that a guy like Johnny Bench would make that tremendous gesture of friendship. It really pumped him up. Dad lived another month. We got another month of his love and wisdom. He talked about the call from Johnny every day until he died. Maybe that is why Bench was the highest of achievers. God gave him values and perspective to go along with his incredible athletic talents. He understood that good friends are far more valuable than any other riches. Where do you find those high achievers? ""They say just once in life You find someone that's right But the world looks so confused I can't tell false from true"" -Karla Bonoff ""My advice to you. I know you think those guys are your friends. You wanna be a true friend to them? Be honest and unmerciful.""  -Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing the writer Lester Bangs in the movie Almost FamousI don't know what motivates someone to be a high achiever, but I know one when I see one. I usually have an intense desire to have them in my life. My wife, Karen Thomas McNay, is president of the Ursuline Academy in New Orleans, the oldest all girls school in the United States. People think it is her great beauty that first attracted me to her (let's be honest, that did not hurt), but it was really her intellect and desire for excellence that made me chase her for months to get my first date and for another stretch to get a second one. The first major attorney to use my structured settlement services was one of the best trial attorneys in the world, Peter Perlman. I've made a lot of money over the past 33 years from the clients and attorneys that Pete has referred to me, but what I really value is his friendship. He is a neat guy. He pushes me to work at his level of perfection that has benefited his clients and all my clients after that, but the trait you notice about Pete is his fantastic loyalty. He gives back. He wins a boatload of awards for helping other lawyers, but does just as much that never gets recognized. Pete is being named to the Hall of Distinguished Alumni at the University of Kentucky for his achievements in his career, but they really need to have students emulate his heart and loyalty. When I had surgery in December, Pete called and checked in on a regular basis. I heard from him yesterday. He drove for hours in the snow to be at my father's funeral. Like a Johnny Bench or Dr. Jim, his true circle is small even though he knows everyone and has universal respect. Pete has some interesting hobbies. Like my grandson, daughters and step daughter, he is an avid comic book collector. ComicCon is in Lexington, Kentucky this weekend and I won't be surprised if Pete is there. There's a lot more to Pete than practicing law. I pinpoint the concept of keeping a small inner circle. Probably because most of the world follows the Will Rogers quote of ""spending money they don't have to impress people they don't know."" I personally wound up with a group of loyal, successful and high achieving friends, but it was nothing that I planned. Pete Mahurin, who is sometimes called ""The Warren Buffet of Kentucky,"" is fascinated with high achievers and put up a million dollars of his money to his alma mater Western Kentucky University for a Center for Gifted Studies. Pete has a theory that gifted people inspire other gifted people when they have a community. They bounce ideas off each other. They give honest feedback and bring each other to a higher level. With modern communications, the community does not have to be based on geography but by common interest and connection. My daughter Gena Bigler is a fundraising and personal finance guru and RRP International is publishing her book Frugal Spending for Rich Living: A Holistic Approach to Money this spring. She watches non-profits make the same mistake over and over again. They ask ""big money"" people for donations without taking the time to develop a relationship. They pitch ideas they are interested in instead of asking the potential donor as to how to spend their money. High achievers have small circles for a practical reason. Too many people want to have a ""drive by"" relationship with them with the hopes of getting a piece of their money or success. It's easier not to trust than it is to ""trust and verify.""Gena runs into the same thing I see over and over again. Non-profits spend a lot of time hoping that some huge donor, with no connection to the cause, will drop out of nowhere and fund one of their pet projects. They would have a better chance if they bought lottery tickets. The odds are 171 million to one. Are High Achievers Born or Made? ""But there never seems to be enough time to do to the things You want to do once you find them"" -Jim Croce""And my only boss was the clock on the wall  And my only friend never really was a friend at all"" -Jim CroceIs it possible for external factors to motivate someone to be a high achiever? If you were not born with some incredible intellect or talent, are you out of luck? Can you make it as a high achiever by hard work and determination? What makes it happen? There can be that ""instant attraction"" when two high achievers meet each other. My first, and really only friend, in New Orleans is a high powered investment analyst who commutes from New York to New Orleans. He is one of the smartest people I have ever met, speaks several languages, can tell you where the world economy will be a year from now and plays the bagpipes. He is a truly fascinating guy and the first time we met, we sat and talked for hours. I went to his house the next night (dressed in a golf shirt, not knowing he was hosting a formal dinner) and we talked for hours again. He got me a wonderful DVD called Ivory Tower that examines the high cost of college. You see how complicated developing friendships gets in middle age. Both of us are intensely busy, live in different cities and travel frequently for work. When we both are in New Orleans at the same time, we both want to spend our precious time with our families, and our families don't want to give up the small amount of time they get with us. Thus, you reach an age where you have fascinating people in your life and know you can call them 24/7, but may go a year or so without talking to them. On the other hand, the sign of a true friendship is knowing you can go for a year, or decade, without communication and pick up the bond as though there was no sign of interruption.Maybe that ability to bond is the key to really high achievement. Having an intuitive sense of trust, which is knowing who is in your life just because you enjoy each other's company. Once you have been burned a few times you err on the side of caution, but the high achievers get the balance of relationships right. Most people don't. My true expertise is helping people like injury victims and lottery winners with wealth transitions. They go from poor to rich very quickly and find that a lot of new (and old) ""friends"" are only interested in their checkbook. Pulitzer Prize winning historian James MacGregor Burns discussed the concept of transactional versus transformational leadership in his book Leadership. Transactional is trading favor for favor and transformational are those, like Gandhi or Martin Luther King, whose leadership transforms the people around them. Maybe the great gift that high achievers have is a micro level ability to take those around them to a higher level. People like Dr. Jim Roach and Peter Perlman get me to want to take my mind to a level that I have never been to before. A guy like Johnny Bench could lead his team to world championships, but I am most impressed that he literally bought another month of life for my father with a well-timed phone call. I don't think it is overt, but high achievers have a sixth sense of who is worthy of their most precious commodity, time, and who is looking for instant gratification. The ability to manage that time is what makes a high achiever a high achiever.

A quarantine zone will be established for miles around the site to limit the movement of poultry.""We are dedicated to providing the necessary assistance and precautions to avoid any possible spreading of the disease,"" said Bill Brown, Kansas' animal health commissioner,The USDA will inform international trading partners and an international animal health organization of the infection.

But some wildlife experts are skeptical of suggestions that wild birds are responsible for spreading the flu in the Midwest.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the risk to people from highly pathogenic flu infections in wild birds and poultry to be low, according to the USDA statement.

The Kurdish allegation could not be independently confirmed.Chlorine is a choking agent whose use as a chemical weapon dates back to World War One. It is banned under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits all use of toxic agents on the battlefield.Peter Sawczak, spokesman for the Dutch-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said: ""We have not had a request from Iraq to investigate claims of use of chemical weapons in Iraq, and the OPCW cannot immediately verify the claims.""  Kurdish Peshmerga forces take security measures against ISIS militants north of Mosul, on Jan. 28, 2015. (Emrah Yorulmaz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)Chlorine has been used ""systematically"" in the civil war in neighboring Syria, an OPCW fact-finding mission found last year. The OPCW would have to get its own samples to confirm the use of chemical weapons in a member state.The Kurdish statement said the car bombing attempt happened on a highway between Mosul and the Syrian border. A Kurdish security source said that the peshmerga fired a rocket at the car carrying the bomb so there were no casualties, except for the suicide bomber.About a dozen peshmerga fighters experienced symptoms of nausea, vomiting, dizziness or weakness, the source said.The statement said the analysis was carried out in a European Union-certified laboratory after the soil and samples were sent by the Kurdish Regional Government to a ""partner nation"" in the U.S.-led coalition that is fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.The source described the samples as ""leftovers from the suicide bomber,"" but declined to identify the laboratory.The White House said in a statement it could not confirm the allegations but found them ""deeply disturbing"" and was monitoring the situation ""very closely.""A U.S. defense official said the use of chlorine as a weapon was a possible sign of ""growing desperation due to the pressure being applied by coalition air power and Iraqi ground forces.""Iraq's Kurds were the victims of the deadliest chemical attack of modern times when Saddam Hussein's air force bombed the town of Halabja in 1988, gassing at least 5,000 people to death.

(WISSAM AL-OKAILI/AFP/Getty Images)WEAPONS EXPERT KILLEDThe U.S. Central Command said on Jan. 30 that an Islamic State chemical weapons expert had been killed in a coalition air strike six days earlier near Mosul - the day after the car bombing cited in Saturday's statement.The expert, Abu Malik, had been a chemical weapons engineer during the rule of Saddam Hussein and then affiliated himself with al Qaeda in Iraq in 2005, Central Command said at the time. When he joined Islamic State, it gave the insurgent force a chemical weapons capability, it added.Malcolm Dando, professor of international security at the University of Bradford, and an expert on biological and chemical warfare, said chlorine was an easy gas to obtain. ""It's extensively used, you only need to google industrial uses of chlorine, it's extensively used industrially,"" he told Reuters.Western diplomats in The Hague, where the OPCW is based, have long feared IS fighters would get their hands on chemical weapons. It is not easy to make such weapons and IS tried to recruit experts when it took over Mosul last year, diplomatic sources told Reuters. They were not believed to have been successful. Kurdish forces, backed by U.S.-led air strikes, have taken a prominent role in fighting the Islamic State jihadists who last year declared a cross-border caliphate after seizing land in eastern Syria and northern Iraq.No international organization has documented the use of chemical weapons on Iraqi territory in the war with Islamic State.The Kurdish authorities said in their statement they had ""long suspected that (IS) fighters have been using chemical agents"" and cited video footage from recent battles around the city of Tikrit between the militants and Iraqi troops and allied Shi'ite militias where ""plumes of orange smoke"" were visible.Reuters was also e-mailed video footage and photos of what the Kurdish Security Council identified as images from the Jan. 23 attack. Among the photos were several canisters lying on the ground that the council says were found at the site and contained chlorine.

(New Hampshire is one of only nine states in the country that does not have a state income tax.) Instead, Walker ably pivoted to a discussion of lowering income tax rates, an alternative more consistent with mainstream views in the Republican Party.""Certainly I think lower rates, we've talked about that. We've looked at that,"" Walker said, adding, ""should I get in this race, that's something we'll take on in that growth category out there.""""I think putting more money back in the hands of the hardworking taxpayers, which is your money to begin with, is a much better way to grow the economy than through government so-called stimulus, which has a much lower rate of return than it does if you and other job creators have that money out there,"" he said.In 2014, Walker drew criticism from Mary Burke, who unsuccessfully challenged him for the governorship, after he expressed interest in eliminating Wisconsin's state income tax.Walker, who is one of the early front-runners for the GOP presidential nomination, spoke Saturday at an event held at a local high school that was billed as a grassroots training session for his possible 2016 campaign. At the session, the conservative governor touted his humble origins in Wisconsin and criticized President Barack Obama for failing to stand up to radical Islamic terrorists."

LOUIS, MO - MARCH 14: Ferguson activists march through downtown during a protest on March 14, 2015 in St. Louis, Missouri. St. Louis and the nearby town of Ferguson have experienced many protests, which have often been violent, since the death of Michael Brown who was shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer in August. On Wednesday evening two police officers were shot while they were securing the Ferguson police station during a protest.

He is one of the few senior city officials remaining after the police chief, a municipal judge and others resigned following a U.S. Department of Justice report March 4 depicting a Ferguson police force mired in racial bias.An uneasy quiet prevailed in the St. Louis suburb, in contrast with the mayhem that erupted near midnight on Thursday when gunshots rang out during a protest rally, wounding a pair of officers.Police arrested two people on Saturday night in neighboring St. Louis when about 70 protesters tried to block a street, a Reuters witness said. They were later released.The shooting on Thursday sent a fresh jolt of tension through a city that has become a symbol of racial conflict since a black teenager was killed by a white police officer last August and a grand jury returned no criminal charges.""There has been a lot of outrage here over the past seven months,"" Montague Simmons, executive director of OBS, explaining why activists were determined to press ahead with their demands. ""We feel this could be a moment of transformation where people go from being outraged to being involved.""Knowles, a Republican who was 31 when he was first elected in 2011 in a non-partisan election, said on Friday that it would be up to voters to remove him from the part-time job.Residents will have 60 days to gather signatures from 15 percent of registered voters in the last mayoral election to prompt a special election, OBS said in the statement.Steve Moore, owner of the Celebrity Soul Food Restaurant, said that when he moved to his current location, Knowles was one of his first customers, asking if there was anything the city could do to help.""He's continuing to make changes and if people get behind him and hold him accountable he's a good leader for the city,"" said Moore. He added that he had lost about 80 percent of his business since the unrest began in August.Some Ferguson residents said they were growing weary, especially after the latest spasm of violence, despite sympathy for protesters who have been out in force since the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown.""It's been emotional here. We all want justice for Mike Brown, but we also have to heal,"" said Jerome Parker, 26, who lives in the area and works in a store. ""I support the protests, but I need to make a living.""Parker also worries about the impact the shooting of the officers will have on the push for reforms in Ferguson.Authorities had nothing new to add to the scant information disclosed about the manhunt for suspects in the police shootings.A day earlier, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said investigators had dozens of leads and authorities had ""a pretty good idea"" where the gunshots had originated, but said no arrests were imminent. He had nothing to say about the kind of gun used, the shooter's motivation and any connection to the protesters.In Thursday's shooting, a 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound and a 32-year-old colleague from a nearby police department sustained a facial wound that left a bullet lodged near his ear. Both were treated and released from hospital. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^TIMELINE-Recent events in protests, policing in United StatesRenewed violence threatens fragile recovery in Missouri city^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> (Additional reporting Jim Young in St. Louis, David Bailey in Minneapolis and Fiona Ortiz in Chicago; Writing by Mary Milliken and Frank McGurty; Editing by Paul Simao, Marguerita Choy and Grant McCool)"

Playwright Joanna Murray-Smith tackles the complexities of Ms. Highsmith's character in this production, a two-hander starring Laura Linney as the novelist and Seth Numrich as a young emissary from Highsmith's publishing company who hopes to sign her on for a next, and likely last novel. The play is set in Highsmith's isolated home in Locarno, Switzerland, where she assiduously avoids the world in the company of her cats, drinks and smokes heavily and contemplates her rapidly approaching death. Needless to say, she is hardly welcoming to the eager young man who has great aspirations for a brilliant career in the publishing world. In fact, we suspect that Highsmith may even have murderous intentions toward this particular visitor. Writing about writers is always a challenge, since their most impressive talents are about words on paper - or possibly clever conversation. Inevitably, a two-person play on a single set must be inhabited with dualing dialogue and perhaps a hint of mystery. Murray-Smith accomplishes both of these tasks admirably, as the characters jab and slice at each other with wit and veiled threats. While their battle occasionally seems slight and sags a bit too often, it never drags unduly. On opening night, Linney -- known for her portrayal of more likeable characters like Abigail Adams and the sister in Savages -- seemed to be grasping a bit to find the right tone for the acerbic Highsmith. But as the evening went on she played the more tender and vulnerable side of the novelist to greater success. Numrich, as the young man swept into Highsmith's web, showed a dynamic range and versatility as he parried with Highsmith, quip for quip. Director Mark Brokaw's evidently light hand in the staging may have softened some of the sharpness of Murray-Smith's script, but did deliver a solidly engaging evening."
