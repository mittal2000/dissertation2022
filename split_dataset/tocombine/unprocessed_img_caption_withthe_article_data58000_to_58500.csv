0,POLITICS,There Is A Hole In Bernie Sanders' Strategy For Winning The Nomination,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-superdelegates-strategy_us_5727b928e4b0bc9cb0442d87,Just how democratic should the Democratic primary be?,2016-05-02,Sanders has a difficult pitch to make to superdelegates.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_65_121_3873_2871%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders' revamped plan for winning the Democratic presidential nomination suffers from an inconsistency that could complicate the case he makes to party insiders and allied groups.The Vermont independent laid out the admittedly difficult path he plans to follow for the remainder of the primary season in a National Press Club address on Sunday. In many ways, it was a more forceful iteration of a proposal his campaign had offered several weeks ago: By doing well in upcoming primaries, he will close the gap in pledged delegates with Hillary Clinton, so much so that neither of them will have the necessary numbers to win the nomination outright without the help of the so-called superdelegates. At that point, Sanders will encourage those superdelegates -- party insiders who also have a say in who becomes the nominee -- to back him on the basis that he would be the stronger candidate in the fall election.On Sunday, Sanders was more explicit about his view of the role that superdelegates need to play, arguing that those from states in which he had already beaten Clinton handedly had an obligation to switch their support to him now.""If I win a state with 70 percent of the votes, you know what? I think I'm entitled to those superdelegates,"" he said.The word ""entitled"" is what complicates Sanders' case.At the same time he was arguing that superdelegates should reflect the will of the primary voters in their states, he continued to make the case that superdelegates did not need to reflect the will of the voters nationally. After the press conference was over, in fact, the Sanders campaign refused to agree that Clinton is ""entitled"" to a share of superdelegates proportional to her margin of victory nationally.""I think we are saying that it is very important,"" Sanders' top strategist, Tad Devine, said of the overall primary results. ""But I also think we have to take into consideration things beyond that.""Sanders' campaign has to make this argument. Right now, Clinton has commitments from an estimated 520 superdelegates to Sanders' 39. And even if superdelegates were obligated to back candidates at the convention based on the results in their states, he'd likely lose since Clinton will have won more states. (Neither candidate will likely win the nomination without the help of superdelegates.)But even prior to Sanders' address, there was evidence that some of his boosters felt uncomfortable with the superdelegate strategy. Moveon.org, for example, continues to stand by its preference that the superdelegates reflect the will of the voters nationally.Devine, in a brief press gaggle, rejected the notion that the senator was essentially applying two standards for superdelegates: democratically distributed in states where candidates scored big wins (the threshold for a big win wasn't stated), but not democratically distributed when all the voting is done.First, Devine made the case that the popular vote in the nominating process was a faulty metric, owing to the different formats (primaries or caucuses) and rules (open or closed primaries) from state to state.""When you say I've won X number of popular votes and your opponent has done stunningly well in contests which are different in nature than the ones where you racked up the popular vote advantage, I would submit that that's somewhat less than a completely objective standard,"" said Devine. ""That number as a barometer of measuring support is weighted to one side and not the other. It is not a fair thing. And we should take that into consideration.""On this front, Devine noted that some of the caucuses still hadn't posted their final vote tallies, making it truly impossible to know just how big a popular vote lead Sanders had to overcome.But in terms of pledged delegates, the race is not as muddled. Clinton currently has 1,645 of those to Sanders' 1,318. The senator would have to win roughly 65 percent of the remaining vote just to catch up with her by the final contest.No one on the Sanders campaign is pollyannaish about the size of that task. They aren't fully ruling out a victory, but optimistically they believe he can be just ""dozens"" of pledged delegates short of Clinton when all the voting is done.Here, again, the case to the superdelegates relies on some crafty salesmanship. Having previously argued that these officials need to reflect the results of their states, the Sanders campaign would, on the eve of the convention, make the case that the momentum and trajectory of the race should be overriding considerations.""Let's suppose that in the next six weeks, Bernie Sanders goes on a tear like he has gone on before. And let's suppose in the 10 states and the four other contests that are out there, he wins the vast majority of them -- he wins California by a huge margin, he racks up an impressive set of victories,"" said Devine. ""Should we then say the only benchmark is who has got more pledged delegates? Shouldn't those superdelegates take into consideration a totality of the circumstances?""Asked if he believed that later contests were more important than earlier ones, Devine didn't flinch.""I think they are,"" he said, ""You know why? Because they are closer to November, that's why, you know. And what happened a year ago is not as important as what's going to happen in June of this year."""
1,MEDIA,Center For Public Integrity Lays Off Two Reporters Amid Restructuring,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/center-for-public-integrity-layoffs_us_5727a5efe4b0b49df6abf293,The cutbacks come on the heels of the Center's international investigative project scoring major scoop with the Panama Papers.,2016-05-02,CEO Peter Bale says three more positions on the Center's project behind the Panama Papers will not be filled. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5727ac8022000036002552b4.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Center for Public Integrity laid off two reporters Friday and will not immediately fill three budgeted positions in what the nonprofit investigative outlet's top executive described as a newsroom restructuring.CEO Peter Bale said the staff reduction is the result of financial pressures and as part of an effort to increasingly focus on core operations like data journalism and visualization. Bale, who joined from CNN International in late 2014, said that the Center’s budget for 2015 was $9.3 million. This year it is a little over $8 million.“We expect to raise all the needed resources for the current fiscal year and have a strong pipeline with donors,” he said. The Center, founded in 1989 to produce journalism in the public interest, won its first Pulitzer Prize in 2014 for an investigation on coal miners dying from black lung disease. The cutbacks come just a month after the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a project of the Center, helped reveal how some of the world’s most powerful people conceal their wealth, in a massive leak of documents known as the Panama Papers. The ICIJ, with a global network of journalists, worked with German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and over 100 news organizations on the scoop. Bale said there aren't any cuts planned for ICIJ, though three proposed and budgeted positions will not be immediately filled. Bale said the Center is still recruiting for a senior-level data journalist to join its staff. The Center now has 40 staff journalists, following Friday's two layoffs. The laid off journalists, senior reporter David Heath and data reporter Alexander Cohen, have had distinguished careers at the Center and other news outlets. Heath, a three-time Pulitzer finalist, won five national journalism awards since joining the Center in 2010, according to his staff bio. He previously worked for The Huffington Post Investigative Fund, and The Seattle Times, where he co-authored a series on cancer research that won several awards, including Harvard University’s Goldsmith Prize and the George Polk award.Cohen was a member of the Center’s investigative team that won an award from the Society of Professional Journalists for a 2004 series on the politics of oil. He worked as chief investigator for nonprofit Public Citizen during the 2008 election and Reuters’ campaign data reporter during the 2012 election before rejoining the Center the following year. Though Cohen specializes in data, a continued area of focus for the Center, the position he held on the national security team was cut as part of the restructuring. Heath confirmed he was laid off, but declined to comment further. Cohen didn't respond to a request for comment.Disclosure: The Huffington Post has partnered with The Center for Public Integrity in the past. The Huffington Post Media Group president and editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington is a member of the Center's board of directors. "
2,POLITICS,One-Time Gore Staffer Leads Plan To Track The 'Environmentalist Left',Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/america-rising-squared-brian-rogers_us_5727a97de4b0f309baf18848,Washington is weird.,2016-05-02,"Brian Rogers, executive director of America Rising Squared, poses for a portrait in his office in Virginia on Dec. 11, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5727bd7922000036002552fd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A Republican opposition research group is launching an effort to track environmental organizations -- and it's being led by Brian Rogers, a former McCain spokesman who once worked for one.Rogers is now the executive director of America Rising Squared, the 501(c)(4) branch of the America Rising political action committee. The group announced on Friday that it would be deploying ""trackers"" to follow billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer, environmental writer and activist Bill McKibben and ""other key players in the Environmentalist Left."" Trackers are most often deployed in political contests, with campaigns sending a dedicated staffer to follow opponents with a video camera in hopes they say something compromising.Politico broke the news early Friday on America Rising Squared's plans. The group said in a press release that its effort will include ""in-depth research, national video tracking network, communications operations, along with a targeted digital ad campaign north of six figures."" The group also recently launched a website.America Rising Squared is targeting high-profile environmentalists like Steyer, who announced plans last week to spend $25 million on get-out-the-vote efforts to educate young people about climate change and energy policies, and spent more than $74 million on races in 2014.""Tom Steyer made a fortune investing in oil and coal, and now he’s dumping an unprecedented amount of money into political causes which promise to increase the value of his latest investments in 'green energy,'"" Rogers said in a statement. ""America Rising Squared will hold Steyer and the Environmentalist Left accountable for their epic hypocrisy and extreme positions which threaten America’s future prosperity."" Rogers is best known as the long-time spokesman for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). He was also McCain's spokesman during the senator's 2008 presidential campaign, during which Rogers made headlines for arguing that Obama, too, lived in ""a frickin' mansion"" and was an ""arugula-eating, pointy-headed professor type.""But Rogers was also, for a short time, the research director for former Vice President Al Gore's Alliance for Climate Protection. Upon taking that job in May 2009, he said he would be ""working on the Repower America campaign to pass comprehensive energy and climate change legislation."" (The announcement prompted one of his former McCain campaign colleagues to joke that ""everybody knew Rogers was a tree-hugger."")While Rogers' move to join Gore's group raised some eyebrows at the time, it wasn't totally crazy. After all, McCain had proposed climate change legislation several times as a senator, and was among the leading Republicans on this issue (until the 2008 election, that is). This was also around the time it seemed there might actually have been an opportunity for bipartisan collaboration on climate change, when the Alliance for Climate Protection ran ads featuring former House speakers Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi and ministers Al Sharpton and Pat Robertson sitting together on a couch.Rogers' job with Gore's group didn't last long, in any case; he was back with McCain's office in less than a year.One former colleague from Rogers' days with the Alliance for Climate Protection said she was ""stunned"" to hear about his position with America Rising Squared.Some targets of the new America Rising Squared campaign said they were not aware of Rogers' past work in the environmental movement. ""I'm of course flattered that our work has exposed the fossil fuel industry enough that they feel the need for this kind of personal attack,"" McKibben said in a statement Friday. ""But as usual, the real news is the lengths they will go to avoid talking about the greatest issue of our time, their ongoing wreckage of the planet's climate, and in the process, so many of its people."" Rogers declined to comment on the new job and his past work. "

""The only thing she’s got going is the woman’s card.”Clinton's response was swift: “If fighting for women’s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in!” Within hours, Clinton's campaign had released a ""woman card."" Over the next three days, the Clinton campaign sent out a series of fundraising emails. ""Claim your free Woman Card today, and let’s show Trump and the Republicans exactly who they’re up against,"" read one of the appeals. The results were eye-popping.From April 28 to April 30, more than 115,000 individual donors contributed to Clinton's presidential campaign. Forty percent of them, or around 47,000, were first-time donors to Clinton's White House bid. The flood of donations in response to Trump's ""woman card"" comments helped Clinton raise a total of $36 million in April, of which $26.4 million was for use in the presidential primary. Clinton also raised another $9.5 million for the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

They were coming off an offseason of scandal, in which the appearance of multiple players in a video of a racist orgy led to the dismissal of three players. The Foxes, who spent most of last season in last place before winning their seven of their final nine matches to stave off relegation, were a favorite in the eyes of oddsmakers to end up back in the Championship, England's second league, next season.Instead, they are champions.

8,POLITICS,Supreme Court Delivers A Victory For Supporters Of Seattle's Minimum Wage Law,Cristian Farias and Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-seattle-minimum-wage_us_572767fbe4b01a5ebde614cd,The justices won't hear a constitutional challenge brought by franchise owners.,2016-05-02,The Seattle ordinance has been a linchpin of the Fight for $15 labor movement.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57276fbb160000e40031d496.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a sweeping constitutional challenge to Seattle's minimum wage law, in what could have been a test case for future legal attacks on similar measures across the country.In a one-line order, the justices declined to hear a case by the International Franchise Association and a group of Seattle franchisees, which had said in court papers that the city's gradual wage increase to $15 discriminates against them in a way that violates the Constitution's commerce clause.""The franchise model not only allows small businesses to get started, it allows interstate consumers to see familiar trademarks and products when they cross state lines,"" said the challengers in their petition to the court. ""Discrimination against franchise businesses is discrimination against interstate commerce.""The business groups had argued that Seattle's decision to raise the minimum wage was unconstitutional because its implementation over several years treated small business differently -- with those associated with franchise networks hit harder than those that choose to remain autonomous.""The effect on small franchisees is dramatic: a small sandwich shop with a handful of employees will need to pay its employees $11 an hour in 2017 if it stays independent, but $15 an hour if it signs a franchise agreement,"" the petition read. ""That amounts to a $160 per week per employee.""Lower courts rejected these and other arguments, including claims that Seattle's wage ordinance violates equal protection principles and even the First Amendment's free speech and association provisions. The challengers abandoned these latter claims in their Supreme Court appeal.Ahead of Monday's action, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the libertarian Cato Institute both filed legal briefs urging the Supreme Court to get involved in the dispute. Paul Clement, a high-powered appellate attorney and former solicitor general under President George W. Bush, represented the franchise association.The court's refusal to take the case didn't note the justices' rationale, but it is possible that the potential for a 4-to-4 split along ideological lines -- as a result of Justice Antonin Scalia's death -- might have played a role in the decision.The challenge to the Seattle law was significant because more and more cities are likely to pass similar ordinances.In 2014, Seattle became the first major U.S. city to pass a $15 minimum wage, which has been the rallying cry of the Fight for $15 labor movement. The law gradually phases in a $15 minimum wage throughout the city, with businesses having to hit certain benchmarks depending on their size. Small employers must raise their wage floor to $15 by 2021, while large employers must reach it by next January.The Seattle legislation was a compromise between the mayor, the City Council, local labor unions and the business community. Many employers feared that voters would approve a more drastic ordinance at the ballot box and create an immediate $15 minimum wage, so they came to the table to hash out a more moderate deal. To varying degrees, the Seattle ordinance has served as a model for other jurisdictions that have passed $15 minimum wages, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, and most recently California and New York state.Unions and progressive activists have had remarkable success in passing state and city minimum wage hikes in lieu of congressional action in recent years. For the first time ever, a majority of states now have a higher minimum wage than the federal level, which is just $7.25 per hour and hasn't moved since 2009."
9,POLITICS,Virginia GOP To Sue Governor Over Voting Rights For Ex-Offenders,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-felon-voting-rights_us_57277ec0e4b01a5ebde6275c,"Democrat Terry McAuliffe last month re-enfranchised over 200,000 Virginians with past felony convictions.",2016-05-02,"Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) will face a lawsuit from Republicans opposed to his executive order re-enfranchising over 200,000 ex-offenders in the state. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_9_73_4395_2738%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans in Virginia said Monday that they plan to sue Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe over an executive order he issued last month restoring voting rights to over 200,000 of the state’s residents who have been disenfranchised by past felony convictions.Virginia is one of only a handful of states that permanently disenfranchises those with prior felony convictions, requiring ex-offenders to individually petition the state government to have their rights restored. McAuliffe’s sweeping order, which was announced on April 22, will allow those ex-offenders who had completed their sentences, probation and/or parole to have their right to vote restored, run for office and serve on a jury or as a notary public. Republicans in the state immediately condemned the order as a partisan move to benefit Democrats. As The Atlantic detailed last month, ex-offenders in Virginia were disenfranchised during the state’s 1902 constitutional convention as an intentional means to limit African-American political power, in reaction to Reconstruction-era reforms. Now, one in five African-Americans in Virginia are unable to vote.The state’s Republican leadership had threatened to sue after McAuliffe announced the order. They did not say on Monday when they would file the lawsuit.“Governor McAuliffe adopted an unprecedented view of executive authority and exceeded the powers granted to him by the Constitution of Virginia when he issued the order restoring the rights of more than 200,000 convicted felons,” state House Speaker William Howell said in a statement. “It is the obligation of the legislative and judicial branches to serve as a check on overreaches of executive power. To that end, we are prepared to uphold the Constitution of Virginia and the rule of law by challenging Governor McAuliffe’s order in court.”State Senate Majority Leader Thomas Norment noted in his statement that McAuliffe’s “predecessors … examined this issue and consistently concluded Virginia’s governor does not have the power to issue blanket restorations.” A lawyer for former Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine concluded in 2010 that rights restorations for ex-offenders should be done individually.But Brian Coy, McAuliffe’s communications director, said in a statement that the governor “acted on his constitutional authority to restore the civil and voting rights of hundreds of thousands of Virginians and bring our Commonwealth into line with 40 other states.”“The Governor is disappointed that Republicans would go to such lengths to continue locking people who have served their time out of their democracy,” he continued. “While Republicans may have found a Washington lawyer for their political lawsuit, they still have yet to articulate any specific constitutional objections to the Governor exercising a power that Article V Section 12 clearly grants him. These Virginians are qualified to vote and they deserve a voice, not more partisan schemes to disenfranchise them.”Article V, Section 12 of the Virginia state constitution reads that the governor’s clemency power includes the ability “to grant reprieves and pardons after conviction” and “to remove political disabilities consequent upon conviction.”Democrats and voting rights advocates generally argue that re-enfranchising ex-offenders helps them reintegrate into society and feel a connection to their communities. McAuliffe had previously ended the requirement that ex-felons pay outstanding court fees before they had their voting rights restored. In 2014, he reduced the number of years that Virginians convicted of violent felonies had to wait before they could petition to be re-enfranchised.As the Brennan Center for Justice has documented, there is growing momentum for restoring voting rights in the states with the most restrictive laws. But voting rights for ex-offenders have functioned as a political football in some states, including Maryland and Kentucky, where Republican governors have resisted and undone rights restoration moves by their Democratic predecessors and legislators.Nearly 6 million Americans are currently banned from voting because of prior felony convictions. Just two states, Maine and Vermont, allow offenders to vote from prison, while 14 states allow ex-offenders to vote after they complete their sentences, but before they are done with their parole or probation. Virginia, Kentucky, Florida and Iowa have the harshest felon disenfranchisement laws. "
10,TECH,Two Words: Driverless Boats,Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/driverless-boats-cut-carbon-emissions_us_57238881e4b0b49df6ab23c6,They're coming.,2016-05-02,Rolls Royce is working with Finnish researchers to develop remote-controlled cargo ships.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5727852a160000e40031d4d3.jpeg?cache=Yi0L5sSui8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remote-controlled ships could hit the high seas within a decade.While they might end up putting sailors out of a job, fully autonomous boats could help the fossil fuel-hungry shipping industry drastically slash its carbon emissions.Staffing a ship with a full crew requires lots of energy. Sailors need food, water, onboard sewage treatment facilities, air conditioning and heating. They also add weight to the vessel, slowing it down. Without a crew on board, a cargo ship could run on 10 to 15 percent less fuel and cut its carbon emissions by a similar percentage, according to Oskar Levander, vice president for innovation at Rolls Royce, which is developing autonomous ships with researchers at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.“The primary benefits of remote and autonomous vessels will be improved efficiency and safety,” Levander told the blog Climate Home. “Obviously anything that makes ships more efficient in terms of energy consumption also has the potential to reduce emissions.” The first driverless boats were developed by the United States Navy and tested in 2014. The Navy designed its fleet of remote-controlled ""swarm boats"" to carry out risky missions without a crew, keeping sailors away from the line of fire. Driverless cargo ships, by contrast, would be responsible mostly for steaming across the ocean, docking, loading or unloading cargo, then steaming on to the next port. And Rolls Royce says its researchers are perfecting the technologies needed to remotely steer ships through the high seas.Shipping goods by sea accounts for between 2 and 3 percent of global carbon emissions -- equivalent to the annual carbon output of Germany. That number could jump to 14 percent by 2050, according to Bill Hemmings, aviation and shipping policy director at Transport and Environment, a group advocating for sustainable industry policies. The quickening pace of global economic growth is driving the rise in shipping emissions. During the 2008 recession, global trade slowed to a crawl, and ships literally cut their speeds to conserve fuel. Now, as the economy rebounds, cargo ships are completing voyages faster and more frequently, increasing their carbon output, said Hemmings.""The easiest way to make a ship more efficient is to slow down,"" Hemmings told The Huffington Post. ""What we all fear is when the economy picks up, average ship speeds are going to pick up and emissions will skyrocket again.""Pollutants emitted by cargo ships, along with emissions from the aviation industry, have been a bone of contention during international climate negotiations. At the December climate talks in Paris, 196 countries pledged to reduce their carbon emissions in a bid to keep planetary warming under two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but the deal didn't include the shipping or aviation sectors. By leaving those two industries out of the agreement, countries have made it much harder to meet the agreed-upon warming targets. ""If shipping and aviation don’t start reducing, these two sectors are going to gobble up whats left of the carbon budget,"" Hemmings added. For large cargo ships, cutting carbon emissions can be tough. Most ships still rely on bunker fuel, the heaviest, dirtiest fuel on the market.

Sailors need food, water, onboard sewage treatment facilities, air conditioning and heating. They also add weight to the vessel, slowing it down. Without a crew on board, a cargo ship could run on 10 to 15 percent less fuel and cut its carbon emissions by a similar percentage, according to Oskar Levander, vice president for innovation at Rolls Royce, which is developing autonomous ships with researchers at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.“The primary benefits of remote and autonomous vessels will be improved efficiency and safety,” Levander told the blog Climate Home. “Obviously anything that makes ships more efficient in terms of energy consumption also has the potential to reduce emissions.” The first driverless boats were developed by the United States Navy and tested in 2014. The Navy designed its fleet of remote-controlled ""swarm boats"" to carry out risky missions without a crew, keeping sailors away from the line of fire. Driverless cargo ships, by contrast, would be responsible mostly for steaming across the ocean, docking, loading or unloading cargo, then steaming on to the next port. And Rolls Royce says its researchers are perfecting the technologies needed to remotely steer ships through the high seas.Shipping goods by sea accounts for between 2 and 3 percent of global carbon emissions -- equivalent to the annual carbon output of Germany. That number could jump to 14 percent by 2050, according to Bill Hemmings, aviation and shipping policy director at Transport and Environment, a group advocating for sustainable industry policies. The quickening pace of global economic growth is driving the rise in shipping emissions. During the 2008 recession, global trade slowed to a crawl, and ships literally cut their speeds to conserve fuel. Now, as the economy rebounds, cargo ships are completing voyages faster and more frequently, increasing their carbon output, said Hemmings.""The easiest way to make a ship more efficient is to slow down,"" Hemmings told The Huffington Post. ""What we all fear is when the economy picks up, average ship speeds are going to pick up and emissions will skyrocket again.""Pollutants emitted by cargo ships, along with emissions from the aviation industry, have been a bone of contention during international climate negotiations. At the December climate talks in Paris, 196 countries pledged to reduce their carbon emissions in a bid to keep planetary warming under two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but the deal didn't include the shipping or aviation sectors. By leaving those two industries out of the agreement, countries have made it much harder to meet the agreed-upon warming targets. ""If shipping and aviation don’t start reducing, these two sectors are going to gobble up whats left of the carbon budget,"" Hemmings added. For large cargo ships, cutting carbon emissions can be tough. Most ships still rely on bunker fuel, the heaviest, dirtiest fuel on the market. Some military vessels run on nuclear power, but it's too risky for commercial boats. Ships could potentially run on lower-carbon ethanol or hydrogen fuel cells, but companies have so far shown little interest in switching.So, shipping companies and researchers are experimenting with ways to make fossil fuel-powered vessels more efficient, said Hemmings.

12,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Indiana’s GOP Primary Will Be A Battle Between Demographics And Economics,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indiana-gop-primary_us_57274c21e4b01a5ebde60526,"The state’s demographics favor Ted Cruz, but the economics and polls point to a Donald Trump win.",2016-05-02,Estimates for Hispanics and blacks show the largest biases of all major subgroups,http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2016/04/PM_2016.05.02_nonprobability-ch1-03.png,"A heavily-evangelical electorate might not give Ted Cruz an advantage in Indiana. Voters seem to care more about being inspired by a candidate than the candidate’s competitiveness. And a new report compares the accuracy of 10 different online panel surveys. This is HuffPollster for Monday, May 2, 2016. INDIANA’S DEMOGRAPHICS FAVOR CRUZ, BUT ECONOMY FAVORS TRUMP - David Wasserman: ""Indiana, which bills itself as the Crossroads of America, has long looked like a huge fork in the road to the GOP nomination. Its 57 delegates make it the largest prize remaining besides California, and its high-stakes delegate allocation rules — winner-take-all statewide and by congressional district — assure the winner will claim a commanding majority….In many respects, Indiana should be a terrific state for the Cruz/Carly Fiorina pre-ticket. Indiana has the highest share of evangelical Protestants of any state yet to vote — 31 percent — which is 9 percentage points higher than in Wisconsin, the site of Cruz’s last triumph. However, here’s why Indiana could be an even better Trump state: It boasts the highest share of manufacturing jobs in the country. From steel mills on the shores of Lake Michigan to the medical device hub of Warsaw, to Elkhart, the 'RV capital of the world,' Indiana’s blue-collar workforce — and its blue-collar retirees — are machine-made for Trump….Then there’s the polling: of the seven polls released this month, most have shown Trump with modest leads ranging from 2 to 9 percentage points."" [538] The demographic/economic interplay has been important for Republican contests - Philip Bump: ""Two weeks ago, [Trump's] strongest territory had been the South. Now, it's the Northeast….This week's contest in Indiana is much different territory for Trump, though. He did well around Chicago, but otherwise the areas bordering the state have been as enthusiastic about Cruz and Kasich as they are about him. He leads in the polls, but it's clear that Indiana will be a much tougher contest….A key thing to note from this is that there's no strong correlation between any demographic point and the results of the 2016 election. This isn't like the Democratic contest, where knowing the percentage of the population that's black can give you a good sense of who will win. Figuring out the overlap of geography and economics and ideology at play on the GOP side is a lot more nuanced than that. Which is another reason that Indiana will be interesting.""

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime).VOTERS CARE MORE ABOUT CANDIDATES' ABILITY TO INSPIRE THAN THEIR COMPETITIVENESS - Frank Newport and Jim Harter: ""We found that, across candidates, the leadership strengths most highly correlated with likelihood to vote for a given candidate were inspiring, cares about individuals, visionary and courageous...For example, the average percentage of those who give each candidate a high rating on competitive and also say they are highly likely to vote for that candidate is 29%...On the other hand, 53% of those who rate a candidate as high on the inspiring dimension also say they are highly likely to vote for that candidate….Overall, the conclusion is that ratings on the 'softer,' not necessarily campaign-related, dimensions are those that really seem to matter to Americans, or at the least are those most differentiating in terms of voting intentions."" [Gallup]HOW ACCURATE ARE ONLINE PANELS? - A new Pew Research report compares a variety of web samples against government data sources like the Census to determine how well the samples represent the population. Pew looked at nine “nonprobability” internet samples -- ones where respondents volunteered to take surveys, rather than being randomly selected -- plus their own online probability-based American Trends Panel, in which respondents are randomly selected. Estimates of civic engagement and measurements of minorities' opinions are particularly problematic - Pew Research: “All the samples evaluated include more politically and civically engaged individuals than benchmark sources indicate should be present. The biases on measures of volunteering and community problem-solving were very large, while those on political engagement were more modest...Online nonprobability survey vendors want to provide samples that are representative of the diversity of the U.S. population, but one important question is whether the panelists who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups are representative of these groups more broadly. This study suggests they are not….researchers using online nonprobability samples are at risk of drawing erroneous conclusions about the effects associated with race and ethnicity.”  [Pew]So, who was the best? - Pew notes that the surveys they studied aren't ""monolithic,"" with some performing significantly better than others, but the only survey they identify by name is their own. The others are identified only by letters A through I. Survey I consistently showed less bias than any of the other samples on just about every metric, but we don’t know which survey company fielded that one. What the report doesn’t mean - Pew’s research focuses on comparing online panels to various known government “benchmarks” (the numbers generally considered the most accurate), but not to telephone surveys. It also doesn’t compare telephone surveys to those benchmarks. The biases shown in the report shouldn’t be read as saying these web panels are inferior to telephone surveys -- that’s not addressed. What the report does mean - Not all web panels are created equal. From the report: “In general, samples with more elaborate sampling and weighting procedures and longer field periods produced more accurate results. The less accurate samples tended to be selected (or ‘balanced’) only with respect to gender, age and region. The best performing samples, by contrast, were balanced not just on those characteristics but also on variables such as education and income….The limitations of this study’s design, however, make these conclusions preliminary at best. Our data come from just nine samples, none of which experimentally manipulated these design features. Consequently, the effects of those features are not well isolated.”It’s not enough to get the sample to “look” representative - More from the report: “Today numerous online survey vendors condition their samples on nondemographic variables in an effort to make them more representative. When implemented carefully and with full consideration of the survey objectives, this practice may help to improve data quality….The implication is that what matters is that the respondents in each demographic category are reflective of their counterparts in the target population. It does not do much good to get the marginal distribution of Hispanics correct if the surveyed Hispanics are systematically different from Hispanics in the larger population.

But in a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer felt compelled to go further, if only to beat the drum he's been beating since last summer: that the death penalty overall is likely unconstitutional.He suggested there's probably no better example of this than the dysfunctional regime run by the Golden State.""Put simply, California’s costly administration of the death penalty likely embodies three fundamental defects about which I have previously written,"" Breyer noted, pointing to his own 2015 dissent in Glossip v. Gross, the Supreme Court's last major showdown over the constitutionality of sentencing a person to die.Breyer wrote that those three defects -- ""serious unreliability,"" ""arbitrariness in application"" and unconscionably ""long delays"" in meting out the punishment -- were all evident in the case of Richard Delmer Boyer, the inmate whose appeal the court turned away on Monday.Boyer was first sentenced to death 32 years ago for the robbery and murder of an elderly couple. But that was only the beginning of his court battles, which by now include a mistrial, a conviction reversed on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, and multiple appeals. There was even an earlier trip to the Supreme Court in 2006.""In all, 22 years elapsed between his first trial and our denial of his petition for certiorari on direct appeal,"" Breyer wrote, referring to Boyer's 2006 appeal. In this latest round, Boyer petitioned the Supreme Court to consider whether this whole painfully slow process leading up to execution -- which he called ""psychologically inhumane"" -- violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.Without directly addressing that claim, Breyer recited the facts: that the system is prohibitively expensive, that more than 10 percent of the death sentences doled out in California are ultimately reversed, that many prisoners on death row die ""of natural causes"" long before they are put to death, that there are more death row suicides than actual executions, and that the small percentage of those who are actually executed seem to constitute a ""random"" group.All of this, the justice said, was reason enough to take Boyer's case.One detail Breyer left out: California has the most populous death row in the country with 743 inmates, some of them waiting for decades. And not a single execution has taken place since 2006. Only 13 men have been put to death in California since 1978, when the state restored the punishment after a Supreme Court-driven hiatus.Maybe California's experiment with capital punishment, on which it has spent some $4 billion since 1978, should be called off for good."

""They're hateful laws and should be repealed,"" King said at a conference for education reporters.Among other things, HB 1523 in Mississippi allows schools and employers to discriminate against people who are trans, while HB 2 in North Carolina requires state universities to bar trans students from using locker rooms or bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. University of North Carolina officials have said they plan to abide by HB 2, but do not know how they are supposed to enforce it. Opponents of these laws say they could threaten federal grants worth billions of dollars -- and if King's remarks are any indication, that seems to be true. ""I do not want to get ahead of enforcement actions we may take in regards to North Carolina and Mississippi,"" King said. ""My hope is legislators will realize they've made a terrible mistake.""The Education Department has not acted on the laws yet. If a public university decides to abide by a state law by denying accommodations for trans students, then the university risks losing all federal funding because it's not complying with the federal gender equity law Title IX, which the Obama administration has said protects trans students from discrimination.That could mean, for example, that no student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill could get a student loan or Pell Grant to attend college. King called the state laws ""deeply problematic,"" and said they send a bad message to young people who may be coming to terms with their gender identity or sexual orientation. President Barack Obama called for the laws to be overturned in April. King's comments urging states to repeal the laws earned a round of applause from Monday's crowd, which consisted of journalists, policy advocates, researchers and college officials. _______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and is based in New York.

Schools that get the exemption are able to turn away LGBT students in matters of admissions, financial aid, housing, sports teams, clubs and even campus counseling.""I find it not only shocking but very disheartening that in 2016, we are still having to fight this fight,"" Clark told The Huffington Post.At least 56 colleges and universities have sought or received this waiver since 2013, which has left thousands of students vulnerable to discrimination who may not even know it.""Students are making a fundamental decision when they're looking at colleges,"" Clark said. ""It will probably be one of the biggest investments of money and resources they make in their lives. We want to be sure that they have all the information to make sure they're making the right choice.""Clark's bill, known as the Transparency in Taxpayer-Funded Discrimination Act, comes as the Department of Education is already pledging to disclose which schools are applying to get the Title IX exemption. Department officials told HuffPost on Monday that they plan to continue releasing the names of these schools on a monthly basis, though this policy could go out the window with a new administration in 2017. If Clark's bill becomes law, it would mean the department has to keep disclosing the names of these schools beyond the Obama administration. It would also require schools that request Title IX exemptions to make it public on their websites. All of these colleges and universities have religious affiliations, and all are private institutions that nevertheless accept public dollars via student loans, financial aid or various grants.""That is the connection for Congress to make,"" Clark said. ""These schools are getting a waiver and subjecting their students to discrimination, but still accepting federal dollars.""The Education Department on Friday released all of the letters from colleges and universities that have sought the exemption since 2009. A separate, longer list identifies schools that applied for exemptions prior to 2009.Title IX law prohibits discrimination based on sex. While its language hasn't changed in its four decades of existence, the Obama administration has interpreted it as also applying to gender identity, which means transgender students can't be discriminated against. That means, for example, that trans students have a right to use the bathroom or locker room that best corresponds to their gender identity.Both the Department of Education and the Department of Justice issued friend-of-the-court briefs last fall in support of a trans teenager suing to be able to use the men's bathrooms at his Virginia school. A federal appeals court sided with the teen in April, citing Title IX protections.Some of the schools that have sought the Title IX exemption include George Fox University, Simpson University and Spring Arbor University, all of which got permission to deny housing accommodations for transgender and gender-nonconforming students. Some universities have requested exemptions for non-LGBT matters. Carson-Newman University in Tennessee, citing religious principles, sought a waiver from the law in order to turn away female students who had babies out of wedlock or who'd had an abortion.For now, administration officials can only make sure they're enforcing current law when it comes to ensuring that people aren't being discriminated against.""We are committed to protecting every student Congress gave us jurisdiction to protect, to the fullest extent of the law,"" said Dorie Nolt, spokeswoman for the Education Department. ""However, Congress did exempt from Title IX’s protection institutions that are controlled by religious organizations to the extent that Title IX conflicts with their religious tenets."" "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Sunday repeatedly avoided saying whether he would support GOP presidential rival Donald Trump as the party’s nominee, as the businessman inches closer to the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination.“I believe if the Republican Party nominates Donald Trump, we will lose to Hillary [Clinton],” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” when host Chuck Todd first posed the question. Todd continued to press Cruz, and the senator sidestepped the question a total of nine times, insisting that he and Trump will face off in a contested convention. Cruz also accused the media of encouraging him to throw in the towel and cede the nomination to Trump.“Why can't you answer the question of whether you can support Donald Trump or not?” Todd asked Cruz.“But Chuck, Chuck, Chuck,” Cruz interrupted. “Let me finish this point I’m making.”Facing an increasingly narrow path to the nomination, Cruz is placing his hopes on Tuesday’s Indiana primary, where he aims to pick up the state’s 57 delegates and slow down Trump’s momentum. But a new poll released Sunday showed him trailing Trump by 15 points, even though Indiana’s GOP voters are primarily conservative and evangelical, a demographic that favors Cruz. The Texas senator dismissed his flagging numbers, insisting that he will continue to challenge Trump.""Regardless of what happens in Indiana, Donald Trump is not getting to 1,237,"" Cruz said on ""Fox News Sunday.” “No one is getting to 1,237. We are headed to a contested convention. I'm going to have a ton of delegates at that convention. Donald is going to have a ton of delegates at that convention. It's going to be a battle to see who can earn a majority.""Cruz has campaigned heavily in Indiana, but it has not gone smoothly. He was pilloried last week for mistakenly calling a basketball hoop a “basketball ring” at a rally held in the gym known for the iconic basketball movie “Hoosiers.”The senator also has lukewarm support among Republican lawmakers, many of whom simply see him as the lesser of two evils when compared to Trump. On Friday, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) gave Cruz a less-than-enthusiastic endorsement.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who reluctantly backed Cruz last month, said Sunday that “Lucifer may be the only person Trump can beat in a general election,” a reference to former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) calling Cruz “Lucifer in the flesh” last week.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Hastert is the longest serving Republican speaker from 1999-2007.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57263c0b2200003600255175.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For nearly 40 years, Scott Cross hid from everybody what he called his ""darkest secret."" And in a federal courtroom, the 53-year-old revealed it to the world. “Coach Hastert sexually abused me in 1979, my senior year in high school,"" Cross said at former House Speaker Dennis Hastert's Wednesday sentencing hearing on bank fraud charges. Hastert reluctantly admitted to abusing multiple students back when he was a high school wrestling coach -- a fact federal investigators inadvertently learned while probing him on banking violations he committed while paying hush money to one of his victims.But a standard loophole in the justice system meant that Hastert would technically go unpunished for his admitted sexual abuse, while his victims would get nothing.Like Cross -- and hundreds of victims from the Catholic church's priest sex abuse scandal -- many child sex abuse survivors come forward later in life only to learn the statute of limitations has locked them out of the courtroom.""When a prosecutor cannot indict an offender for these heinous acts because the statute of limitations has run, it raises serious moral, legal and ethical questions,"" Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a Thursday statement.Madigan is among those who have urged lawmakers to eliminate entirely the statute of limitations for all sex crimes involving children. It's especially important to eliminate a statute of limitations when the victim of a crime is a child, said Barbara Blaine, president of the victims advocacy group Survivors Network Of Those Abused By Priests.""Most [sexual abuse] victims have been closed out of the courtroom because it takes them so long to tell,"" Blaine said. During interviews with U.S. attorneys, Hastert's victims cited his position and gave a common refrain: ""Who would believe me?"" In court Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin took pains to detail why Hastert's 15-month prison sentence for bank fraud could not encompass the decades-old abuse he had just admitted to (and had not been charged for). Durkin noted that Hastert was a ""serial child molester"" even though he could never be prosecuted as one in a court of law. Such a label was near-unfathomable 13 years earlier when Hastert voted for the law that eliminated the statute of limitations on federal child sex abuse and kidnapping crimes.But most child sex abuse cases are not in federal purview, and states have their own patchwork of laws on time-barred prosecution.Timelines range from South Dakota's brief three year reporting window to Illinois' relatively long 20-year window. Time limits also vary based on factors like the date of the alleged abuse or whether a responsible party like a teacher or social worker failed to report the abuse when it occurred. Experts say current statute of limitations rules unduly and even unrealistically burden young victims with reporting abuse they haven't come to terms with -- or don't even understand. ""Most adults have difficultly sorting out how to proceed after a crime happens,"" said Polly Poskin, the executive director of the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault. ""A child might not even know that they can go to the police. They know about the police but they might not know what happened to them in cases is a crime."" Even as victims of childhood crimes grow up, persistent cultural attitudes around victim blaming -- like the notion that accusations are made out of anger or revenge -- can keep a victim silent, Poksin adds. ""We as a culture have a terrible record of believing the victim of a sexual assault or sexual abuse,"" Poskin said. ""Victims don’t think they will be believed or that they'll be supported and not blamed.""Those who oppose an elimination of the statute of limitations on prosecuting child sex abuse argue it's a violation of due process for the accused.Other objections touch on the fact that decades-old allegations typically have ""stale evidence [and] little to no physical evidence,"" Poskin said.""Usually, there are no witnesses either. Perpetrators usually isolate their victim. And the victims might not know each other and tell each other.""Proving child sexual abuse beyond a reasonable doubt remains a difficult case to make regardless of when it's reported, and time almost always works against a victim because memories fade, witnesses die and evidence is lost.At least four states -- California, Minnesota, Delaware and Hawaii -- have opened a window of time ranging from one to three years during which anyone who was sexually abused as a child could bring forward a claim of abuse no matter how long ago it happened. By the time California closed its one-year reporting window in 2004, at least 800 claims had been filed. In Hawaii, some of the several-dozen claims dated back to the 1950s. Poskin said one of the most compelling reasons to remove the statute of limitations is a simple one: ""The perpetrator might confess.""In Hastert's case, one confession begat several more, which Poskin said can increase the pressure to confess. ""If the current law doesn’t allow us to indict the Denny Hasterts of the world, then the law isn’t doing its job."""
