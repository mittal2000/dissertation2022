0,ARTS,The Case for Spotify: How I Became a Music Streamer in Spite of Myself,"Albert Imperato, ContributorCo-founded 21C Media Group",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-case-for-spotify-how-_b_6805526.html,"It's been a few years now since I began paying for Spotify's premium service, and to my enormous surprise I think I've been converted. Sure, I still buy some CDs and download albums that I think I'll want in my ""permanent"" collection. But most of my listening these days has been on Spotify. And, I've begun to understand why.",2015-03-05,"A Spotify logo is seen as founder and CEO Daniel Ek addresses a press conference in New York, December 11, 2013. The music streaming service, Spotify, unveiled a new ad-based service for mobile and tablet users that will allow access to Spotify's song catalog for free. Ek also announced, that the Spotify catalog will now include the works of Led Zeppelin, the legendary band that until this deal had withheld its music from streaming services. AFP PHOTO/Emmanuel Dunand (Photo credit should read EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb28bd9200000e800fff390.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A much-admired record executive told me over lunch months ago that he hated what Spotify and other music streaming services were doing to the business. ""We tell artists that it's their decision whether to offer their music through these services, but personally I don't like them,"" he groused, adding:I don't want a collection of everything to draw my listening from. I want to curate my own collection, buy my own albums, listen to them one at a time, and have each one of them have a special place in my life. This everything-you-can eat mentality really reduces these albums to a kind pulp. And of course, none of the artists are being fairly compensated for streamed music, and I don't think they ever will.A few weeks later I read an article by New Yorker critic Alex Ross that conveyed similar sentiments. You can read that article here:As someone who was drawn into the music business by a love of ""physical"" albums, and who has amassed an embarrassingly huge collection of recordings, I was suspicious of Spotify and other similar streaming-music similar services from day one. I loved my CDs -- holding them in my hand, taking out and reading the liner notes, seeing them stacked neatly and in alphabetical order on my shelves. It was bad enough that some new albums were only being issued as downloads and that I couldn't buy them on CD even if I wanted to. Now I had to consider whether I wanted to pay money to listen to albums that I didn't actually own. Well, it's been a few years now since I began paying for Spotify's premium service, and to my enormous surprise I think I've been converted. Sure, I still buy some CDs, and even more so, download albums that I think I'll want in my ""permanent"" collection. But most of my listening these days has been on Spotify. And, I've begun to understand why.On the practical side of the equation are the obvious benefits, the number one being the limitless number of albums to choose from in every genre. With no need to purchase something you might not like, you are free to be curious and omnivorous. And you don't need ever-increasing amount of shelf space to accommodate your obsession. Not only have I run out of room for more CDs, but my computer hard drive and iCloud storage spaces are also already close to full. And who can forget the appeal and convenience of sending an unlimited supply of music wirelessly to your speakers from your bed or bathtub via smartphone?For a classical music fanatic like me, streaming has allowed me to discover a treasure trove of new interpretations of both core and lesser-known works. I may love my Bernstein and Tennstedt and Abbado recordings of Mahler's symphonies, but thanks to Spotify, I have discovered that my earlier antipathy to Solti's seemingly over-driven Mahler was unfounded. I would have never purchased another set of Brahms Symphonies (really, do I need to own more than five sets?), but thanks to Spotify I experienced unalloyed pleasure getting to know Harnoncourt's cycle with the Berlin Philharmonic, as well as Chailly's more recent one with the Leipzig Gewandhaus. And there are rediscoveries, too: I had long ago given away my Hogwood recordings of the Beethoven Symphonies, but hearing them again on Spotify was an unexpectedly joyous experience.Philosophically, I feel that Spotify has made me a more open-minded listener. No longer having to convince myself that my ""fully owned"" recording of Schumann's Second Symphony is ""the best"" or -- even worse -- the ""definitive"" version, I've increasingly found myself enjoying a wider variety of interpretations of it and countless other works. Streaming an album that I may or may not revisit in the future more closely resembles the feeling of attending a concert -- from a certain point of view, playing different recordings each time can turn each listening experience into a special event. With streaming, the emphasis can be on listening and not on owning -- and you don't have to defend your purchases by thinking they are better than the other ones you might have made.Sure, the experience of searching for a particular recording or classical work can be exasperating; clearly the people who code the key info -- the so-called metadata -- never went to library school. And there are wonderful labels -- I won't name them here -- that choose to avoid Spotify and other streaming services altogether, keeping much essential music making ""off the grid."" And for some people, the sound quality is simply beneath acceptable (for me, a non-audiophile, that has never been an issue). Not to mention liner notes (What liner notes?)! But these have become minor quibbles for me.Clearly the debate needs to continue on what kind of viable, sustainable, equitable-to-all system need be constructed to serve all interested parties when it comes to musicians connecting with their audiences. As for that elephant in the room, the issue of artists getting paid their due, I have a modest proposal that might suit several competing agendas. How about allowing people to play each song or album a discrete number of times -- let's say five times -- and after that charge the listener something approaching the price of a full download for the ""permanent"" rights to access that song or album in perpetuity? After all, if you love it, you should have to put a ring on it!"

Costa Rica's government denounced on Monday the presence of Niocaraguan troops in Costa Rican territory and requested the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) Jose Miguel Insulza, to convene the Permanent Council of the organism. AFP PHOTO/ Yuri CORTEZ (Photo credit should read YURI CORTEZ/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb16570260000e900818b37.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When you run an organization that fixes rivers, you can find your office in some pretty exotic locations. In the last year, I've been on water in Patagonia, checked out watershed dynamics in Costa Rica, and had my gear dropped by mules in the Montana wilderness to run an untamed section of river. Sometimes arduous, often epic, but always useful, there is a method to the madness. Reality checksAfter presenting to the International Association for Impact Assessment in Vina del Mar on how to quantify conservation actions, I headed south to check out the status of freshwater resources in Patagonia. What I saw, surprisingly and immediately, was that much of the landscape had been hammered by grazing and replanted non-native trees. The picture in my mind's eye was something very different -- I had anticipated an environmental Shangri-La, but instead I got endless miles of fence row and Mercedes Unimogs stacked full of firewood used to heat everything from schools to hospitals. I found rivers full of non-native species, ranging from planted German Brown Trout to Atlantic Salmon escaped from fish farms off the coast.  When in Costa Rica to discuss new conservation financing mechanisms (and yes, surf before breakfast) with thought leaders and practitioners, I had a similar reality check. Most of us think of Costa Rica as a jungle paradise. But on the Pacific coast, it is largely a dry forest ecosystem and where I went, the subsistence farming had slowly but surely simplified the forest-mangrove-ecosystem of the Nandamojo River (""river of plenty"") in Guanacoste to the point where real restoration action is needed. Conservation, in both instances, has to make financial sense to the locals before it can happen. The locals are working on it at Our Watershed, but regulations are often not promulgated or unenforced, and very little public funding is available for restoration. Common ground I don't go to new places to purposely get bummed out. The fact is, I'm already pretty unsatisfied about the status of most all freshwater ecosystems. Rather, I go into these environments with like-minded -- and sometimes different-minded -- people to expose them firsthand to what's happening on the ground. Getting out there is far superior to simply explaining things verbally. All you have to do is crank the boat around and be quiet; the place will largely explain itself. The other big thing derives from sharing a common experience in an uncommon environment. It builds trust. It breaks down barriers. And these factors allow for honest exchanges, and disagreements to be explored vigorously in order to out the truth and change minds in a way that cannot happen in places with walls. Nothing can unite two traditional opponents quite like a long horse trip through bear country after dark, or getting thrown from a raft in whitewater. Rivalries that matter in civilized settings lose their importance in the field. And that's a good thing, especially when the new perspective is often what remains.  Time and again, I've seen willful ignorance give way to honest and heated debate after a few days together in a common journey through uncommon territory. Once you know somebody better, you can speak your mind and understand theirs. I applaud those who make these kinds of exchanges happen, work hard to precipitate them myself, but still wish there were opportunities for more. Paths forward Across the board, the bulk of the environmental problems we face stem from humans simplifying ecosystems while building complex economic relationships. Fixing our rivers requires that we reintroduce complexity and function through restoration -- effectively reshaping the relationship between the economy and the environment. That difficult task only begins with a grounded understanding of the resource and its local realities, and only continues through honest debate and problem-solving. And a lot of time, that can only happen in the strangest places. I'm in. And if you get the chance, you should be too. Follow Joe S.

(Photo © Mariana Ceratti/World Bank)Women are emerging as a major force for change. Countries that have invested in girls' education and removed legal barriers that prevent women from achieving their potential are now seeing the benefits.Let's take Latin America. More than 70 million women have joined the labor force in recent years. Two thirds of the increase in women's labor force participation in the last two decades can be attributed to more education and the fact that women marry later and have fewer children. As a result, between 2000 and 2010, women's earnings contributed to about 30 percent of the reduction in extreme poverty in the region. In fact, for countries to leave poverty behind, both men and women need to get to equal and push the frontiers of equal opportunities even further. But to get there, we need to tackle three issues.First, violence against women needs to end. More than 700 million women worldwide are estimated to have been subject to violence at the hands of a husband or partner. Domestic violence comes with great costs to individuals but also has significant impacts on families, communities, and economies. Its negative impact on productivity costs Chile up to 2 percent of its GDP, and Brazil 1.2 percent. Many girls and women have little control over their sexual and reproductive health: If current trends persist, more than 142 million girls will be married off over the next decade while they are still children themselves.Sometimes protecting women from violence demands innovation. In Rio de Janeiro the World Bank is working with the government to upgrade the urban transport system and make it safer for women through improved lighting, women's restrooms in all metro stations, and services such as women's police stations, women's clinics, and family courts in some of the major terminals. A similar initiative is underway in Ecuador. In Africa's Great Lakes region, we provide grants so that survivors of sexual violence get proper health care.Second, women and girls still don't have the same opportunities and struggle to make decisions about their own lives. From the female farmer in Eastern Congo who is too afraid of marauding militias to work her fields to the working woman in Rio who isn't on equal footing for higher-paid jobs, significant gaps remain. Women are often paid far less than men, while they also perform most of the world's unpaid care work. Globally, they not only earn less but own less and are far less likely to have access to financial services and other resources that would boost productivity. If women had equal access to fertilizer and modern farm machinery, developing countries would produce between 2.5-percent and 4-percent more food. Across the developing world, more than one third of young women are unemployed, and many are discouraged from starting their own businesses or cannot get the credit to do so. It makes a critical difference that in Colombia, for example, more than 1,300 women from regions with high levels of violence are receiving training and support to start small companies.Finally, leadership and role models can make a difference. I remember my first meeting with my management team when I became Indonesia's Minister of Finance. I was the youngest person and the first woman ever to hold that job. Everybody else in the room was male. I knew then that I had to work harder than any man to prove to them that I was capable. I am sure many women who have pushed through the glass ceiling have had similar experiences.But women around the world remain sorely underrepresented in decision making, account for less than 22 percent of the world's parliamentarians and less than 5 percent of the world's mayors. As of January 2015, only 10 women had served as heads of state, and 15 had served as heads of government.We can do better. And we must, because when women succeed, they bring diversity into policy making and inclusiveness into policy. When mothers are educated, they have fewer and healthier children. Studies from around the world -- from Bangladesh and Brazil to China and the United Kingdom -- show that when women earn money and have more control over household spending, they spend in ways that benefit children. They are powerful drivers of growth and formidable fighters of poverty. In other words, they are a force no country, no society, no company, and no family can afford not to unleash fully."

To me, you are a great baseball player who has demonstrated commitment and determination when faced with adversity. I have followed you in your quest to become an All-Star second baseman and truly admire what you have accomplished. To my son, you are more -- you are a role model. I understand that may not have been something you signed up for, but for better or worse, for him and others like him, you are larger than life. Let me try to explain why what you said was not an innocuous sound byte, but rather an offensive statement. First, I do not have a lifestyle. I didn't choose my sexuality the same way you didn't choose yours. Second, being gay is not what defines me, but rather it is just one important part of who I am. So when you say that you disagree with who I am, you are also disagreeing with my son and my family. We are not a lifestyle choice -- we are a family. Even though I am extremely disappointed and hurt by your remarks, I am grateful that you spoke your mind, as it has started a national conversation. The discussions taking place today on social media, in bars and churches, and around the dining room table are exactly how GLBT progress is achieved. I know it is hard moving to an unfamiliar position (think about your transition to second base), but with faith, openness and commitment, positive change can truly happen.Some wonder how the gay rights movement has progressed so well so fast. To me it is quite simple: once you recognize that your brother, son, neighbor, or co-worker is gay, you don't just continue to ""love him"" but you learn to actually accept and respect him for who he is as a person -- and that changes everything.So Mr. Murphy, thank you for starting a very important dialogue. My son and I will be travelling out from San Francisco to root on our Mets this weekend in Port St. Lucie. If you are around we would love to meet you and continue the conversation in person.Thank you for your time. All the best,  Jon and Sammy"

To me, you are a great baseball player who has demonstrated commitment and determination when faced with adversity. I have followed you in your quest to become an All-Star second baseman and truly admire what you have accomplished. To my son, you are more -- you are a role model. I understand that may not have been something you signed up for, but for better or worse, for him and others like him, you are larger than life. Let me try to explain why what you said was not an innocuous sound byte, but rather an offensive statement. First, I do not have a lifestyle. I didn't choose my sexuality the same way you didn't choose yours. Second, being gay is not what defines me, but rather it is just one important part of who I am. So when you say that you disagree with who I am, you are also disagreeing with my son and my family. We are not a lifestyle choice -- we are a family. Even though I am extremely disappointed and hurt by your remarks, I am grateful that you spoke your mind, as it has started a national conversation. The discussions taking place today on social media, in bars and churches, and around the dining room table are exactly how GLBT progress is achieved. I know it is hard moving to an unfamiliar position (think about your transition to second base), but with faith, openness and commitment, positive change can truly happen.Some wonder how the gay rights movement has progressed so well so fast. To me it is quite simple: once you recognize that your brother, son, neighbor, or co-worker is gay, you don't just continue to ""love him"" but you learn to actually accept and respect him for who he is as a person -- and that changes everything.So Mr. Murphy, thank you for starting a very important dialogue. My son and I will be travelling out from San Francisco to root on our Mets this weekend in Port St. Lucie. If you are around we would love to meet you and continue the conversation in person.Thank you for your time. All the best,  Jon and Sammy"

It said Sant appeared to side with police during news conferences on the investigation.""Your ability to make any charging decision is compromised by your apparent working relationship with the [Special Investigation Unit],"" Consejo Latino said in a letter mailed to Sant that was dated Tuesday.""For the sake of the community, we believe it is critical that another prosecutor, who can be seen as credible and neutral, assume control in this case immediately,"" the letter added.The Hispanic community makes up the majority of the population in Pasco, in Washington state's agricultural heartland.The prosecutor's office could not be immediately reached to respond to the allegations.The FBI and a U.S. attorney in Washington state have said they are monitoring the probe, which is being handled by the special investigative unit that excludes Pasco police.The family of Zambrano-Montes has already urged the U.S. Justice Department to take over the investigation into the slaying, which the Mexican government has condemned as a disproportionate use of lethal force.Consejo Latino's plea echoes calls to replace local prosecutors in places like Ferguson, Missouri and New York City, where officials declined to press charges against white police officers who used lethal force against unarmed African-American suspects last year.

Kennedy Department of Justice Building March 4, 2015 in Washington, DC. Holder delivered the remarks for an audience of department employees who worked on the investigations after a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, sparking weeks of demonstrations and violent clashes. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ec5a2100002501c96c26.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the last six years, it has become de rigueur for pundits and prognosticators to read questionable motives -- most often racial or political -- into nearly every decision taken by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.The fact that this comes with the territory, given the Justice Department's unique mission and mandate, makes it no less an exercise in futility. As I wrote last week, throughout Holder's eventful tenure -- both publicly and behind closed doors -- the attorney general has been rigorous in maintaining his department's independence, at times to the consternation of political types on both sides of the aisle.This is as it should be. On nearly all matters, the Justice Department's involvement in politics is rigidly proscribed -- something that certain of Holder's predecessors have forgotten or neglected only at great peril. As a result, even in the face of staunch criticism, the attorney general has consistently exhibited a healthy disdain for political considerations, particularly in the law enforcement context.Unsurprisingly, this has seldom prevented Holder's most strident critics from ascribing dubious motivations to his every move. This week's hotly-anticipated announcements -- regarding pervasive racial discrimination by the Ferguson, Missouri Police Department and the declination of federal civil rights charges against Officer Darren Wilson -- proved no exception.Whatever one's politics, the findings of the Justice Department's ""pattern or practice"" investigation into the Ferguson Police Department -- as laid out by seasoned, career attorneys and investigators in the Civil Rights Division -- are indisputable, unambiguous and frankly damning. These findings, which Holder himself described as ""searing,"" paint a startling portrait of a system that is profoundly broken, an abusive police force that appears to be driven more by profit than by public safety, and a populace that is regularly preyed upon -- rather than protected -- by local authorities.Most disturbingly, of course, the report also makes clear -- in vivid anecdotes and appalling statistics -- that routine constitutional violations, ranging from unwarranted stops and searches to excessive uses of force, have overwhelmingly been directed at Ferguson's African-American residents. Per USA Today:African Americans account for 67% of the population in Ferguson, but they accounted for 85% of the drivers stopped by police, 90% of the people issued tickets and 93% of the people arrested, a three-year examination of suspect stops found. When those cases reached the Municipal Court, authorities collected more fines for suspects' failure to appear than any other charge, mostly from the city's poorest and most vulnerable residents.In this poisonous atmosphere, as Holder suggested, it is not hard to imagine how a seemingly-routine interaction between a young black man -- perhaps feeling the weight of years of systemic discrimination -- and a lone officer, whose difficult job had been made immeasurably more dangerous by mounting hostility, might escalate into a fatal confrontation. This context also explains the explosive community response to the shooting death of Michael Brown last August -- a tragedy, magnified by pent-up frustration, that played into a well-established (and now thoroughly substantiated) narrative about how African Americans are treated at the hands of the Ferguson Police.Of course, these findings should not be construed as condemnatory of law enforcement writ large (despite nagging allegations to the contrary, Holder's record of support for local police has in fact been exemplary, and he has been full-throated in his praise for law enforcement throughout his tenure). But sadly -- if predictably -- public reactions to the Justice Department's investigations in Ferguson have generally broken down along political lines. And the usual prognostications began long before the facts of these investigations, let alone their outcomes, were publicly known.In one particularly egregious example, reflexive Holder critic and Sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin David Clarke took to the airwaves early this week to urge Ferguson city officials to fight the ""outrageous"" Justice Department report, characterizing the inquiry as an ""abuse of power"" on the part of the attorney general. At the time, the report had not yet been released; Sheriff Clarke could not possibly have known with anything approaching certainty what evidence it might contain (after the announcement, he did not hesitate to double down).That we should expect better from Clarke, as an ostensibly fair-minded officer of the law, is beyond question. Irresponsible and uninformed speculation does not become those in positions of authority. And such unfortunate and invective-laced statements illustrate precisely why politics must be avoided at all costs if this inarguably tragic state of affairs is to meet with a constructive resolution.The Justice Department's findings demand a thorough accounting. The people and police officers of Ferguson can ill afford to allow the difficult but necessary reform process that's now underway to be subsumed by petty politics.To plunge headlong into a dialogue defined by the same narrow, reductive, zero-sum talking points that frame so much of our national debate -- in other words, to continue this descent into political quicksand -- would be an inexcusable mistake. There are no ""winners"" or ""losers,"" political or otherwise, in either of the cases at issue. To pretend otherwise is to trivialize the very real harms that have been visited on the people of Ferguson - and the very real risks that brave law enforcement officers throughout the nation are asked to confront on a regular basis.Now that the facts are known, there is no room to deny the unbearably hard truths that the Justice Department's investigations have exposed. The question, instead, is what can and should be done about them.As the attorney general has repeatedly said, this is about the interests and the safety of police officers as well as protestors. It is long past time for responsible actors to follow Holder's lead in rejecting political posturing in favor of constructive, inclusive, and fact-based dialogue."

West paid a visit on Ryan Seacrest and his ""On Air"" radio show Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2015, to expound on his post-Grammy diss of the Album of the Year winner, Beck. The rapper walked up the steps at the Staples Center in Los Angeles as Beck was accepting his award Sunday night but retreated. During an aftershow on E!, West ranted that Beck should ""respect artistry"" and turn over his statue to fellow nominee Beyonce. West told Seacrest of his stair-climbing antics: ""It was kind of a joke like the Grammys themselves."" (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae56493c000020010b6eda.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like most televised music and awards shows, Kanye West's recent appearance on Saturday Night Live's 40th Anniversary Special produced a slew of polarized rants across the social media sphere. Much like candy corn, country music, and thunderstorms, people tend to fervently hate or passionately love West -- with very few opinions falling somewhere in between.  This shouldn't come as much of a surprise, as West has spent his fair share of time in the limelight for controversial stunts (recall the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards with Taylor Swift, or his unscripted political tirade on the NBC's 2005 Concert for Hurricane Relief). In interviews, he's dubbed himself ""a creative genius,"" ""the voice of the generation,"" and nothing less than ""the best rapper"" out there.  As I scrolled through Twitter following his SNL performance, I saw a reoccurring theme in the tweets of those who love to hate West, criticizing him for being ""cocky,"" ""arrogant,"" and downright narcissistic. This got me thinking about the way we perceive confidence and self-love in a society full of young people that lack both so greatly. And then it hit me: While Kanye West might not be the hero our generation wants, he is without a doubt the hero our generation needs.  Along with how to artfully toe the line between confident and cocky, here are five other lessons that we can all learn from Mr. West:  1. Dare to be different  Growing into fame, Kanye West was and still remains unapologetically different from the other rappers of his time. His ability to stand out, however, goes beyond his story-like lyrics or high-end sense of style. While today's celebrities and artists are constantly encouraged to remain grounded and selfless, West recognizes his own abilities and challenges others to do the same.  ""People always tell you, 'be humble, be humble,'"" said West to the crowd at a 2011 performance in Los Angeles' Staples Center. ""When was the last time someone told you to be amazing? Be great! Be awesome!""   Whether you're a fan of him or not, West makes a valid point about our society's tendency to downplay our talents, achievements, and strengths in an effort to appear humble. While there's nothing wrong with a little modesty, there's a lot to be said for taking a Kanye-esque approach to living and simply embracing what you're good at. After all, what's wrong with that?  2. Handle criticism like a champ  Whether you're a student, employee, artist, athlete, or a human being in general, we're all plagued by criticism at some point in our lives -- if not daily. However, what's far more important than the harsh words you face from others is the way in which you respond to it. As someone who's received more than his fair share of hate, West has taught himself to handle criticism like a champ.  ""Criticism can bother you, but you should be more bothered if there's no criticism,"" said West in a 2008 radio interview. ""That means you're too safe.""  In other words, it's all about flipping your perspective and the way you perceive the criticism that surrounds you. Would you rather spend your entire life playing things safe, or take creative risks that stir controversy and emotion? I think we all know what Kanye would do.  3. Be original  What sets Kanye apart from other modern-day artists is his ability to constantly keep his fans on their toes in anticipation of his next move. After all, rumors of a release for his upcoming, still untitled album have been swirling since fall 2014 despite the fact that he's yet to confirm a date.  And this isn't the first time Kanye has taken an unconventional approach to releasing and promoting an album. In 2013, the music video for his track ""New Slaves"" was projected onto the side of buildings in over 66 locations internationally, all in an effort to build hype for the release of Yeezus.  ""I'm a creative genius, and there's no other way to word it,"" said West in a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone.  4. Learning never stops  Just because your formal education ends or you finally turn 18 doesn't mean you're done learning for the rest of your life. In fact, some of the best lessons can come from mistakes that we learn on the job, in the real world, or as adults.  ""If you learn from your mistakes, then I'm a fucking genius,"" said West in a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone.  Even as an adult who's been around the block a few times, Kanye admits that he's still learning lessons every day. However, his carefree attitude and ability to focus on the future and his goals keeps him from getting caught up in the mistakes of the past.   Not to mention, he's constantly surrounding himself with other greats of the music and entertainment industry -- this is evident through his collaborations with artists like Jay-Z, John Legend, Frank Ocean, and Lupe Fiasco. He shows us that by surrounding yourself with the best in the business (whatever your business may be), you're setting yourself up for success.  5. Carpe diem  If there's one mantra that truly captures everything it means to live like Kanye, then it's carpe diem or ""seize the day."" Whether he's spending 12-hour days in the studio, responding to harsh criticism, promoting an upcoming album or fearlessly speaking his mind, fans and haters alike can't deny that he's making the most of every minute.   ""If you have the opportunity to play the game of life, you need to appreciate every moment,"" said West in his 2005 Grammy acceptance speech. ""A lot of people don't appreciate the moment until it's passed.""  When you picture the ideal role model for the modern-day youth, Kanye West probably isn't the first person that comes to mind. However, there's a lot our generation can learn about channeling confidence and self-love from the artist who's never been afraid to put himself first. Next time you're faced with harsh criticism, a creative block, or a mistake from the past, ask yourself: what would Yeezus do?"

Peshmerga forces and Iraqi police retook the Khubbaz oil field and eight villages on January 31, and also freed 24 workers who had been taken captive. AFP PHOTO / MARWAN IBRAHIM (Photo credit should read MARWAN IBRAHIM/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc146502300005000d0c71b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Saif Hameed and Dominic EvansBAGHDAD, March 5 (Reuters) - Islamic State militants have set fire to oil wells northeast of the city of Tikrit, a witness said, to obstruct an assault by Shi'ite militia fighters and Iraqi soldiers trying to drive them from the Sunni Muslim city and surrounding towns.The witness and a military source said Islamic State fighters ignited the fire at the Ajil oil field to shield themselves from attack by Iraqi military helicopters.The offensive is the biggest Iraqi forces have yet mounted against IS, which has declared an Islamic caliphate on captured territory in Iraq and Syria and spread fear across the region by slaughtering Arab and Western hostages and killing or kidnapping members of religious minorities like Yazidis and Christians.Black smoke could be seen rising from the oil field since Wednesday afternoon, said the witness, who accompanied Iraqi militia and soldiers as they advanced on Tikrit from the east.Control of oil fields has played an important part in funding Islamic State, even if it lacks the technical expertise to run them at full capacity.Before it took over Ajil last June, the field produced 25,000 barrels per day of crude that were shipped to the Kirkuk refinery to the north-east, as well as 150 million cubic feet of gas per day piped to the government-controlled Kirkuk power station.An engineer at the site, about 35 km (20 miles) northeast of Tikrit, told Reuters last July that Islamic State fighters were pumping lower volumes of oil from Ajil, fearing that their primitive extraction techniques could ignite the gas.Bombing in August damaged the Ajil field's control room, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The outcome of the battle for Tikrit, best known as the home town of executed Sunni president Saddam Hussein, will determine whether and how fast the Iraqi forces can advance further north and attempt to win back Mosul, the biggest city under Islamic State rule.The army, backed by Shi'ite militia and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, has yet to reconquer and secure any city held by Islamic State, despite seven months of air strikes by a U.S.-led coalition, as well as weapons supplies and strategic support from neighboring Iran.Tehran, not Washington, has been the key player in the current offensive, with Iranian Revolutionary Guard general Qassem Soleimani seen directing operations on the eastern flank, and Iranian-backed militia fighters leading much of the operation.MILITIA LEADER KILLEDSoldiers and militia are also advancing along the Tigris river from the north and south of Tikrit, preparing for a joint offensive which is expected in coming days. They are likely to attack first the towns of al-Dour and al-Alam to the south and north of Tikrit.Their approach has been slowed by roadside bombs, snipers and suicide bomb attacks.An Islamic State suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden tanker on Wednesday night into a camp on the eastern edge of al-Dour, killing a leader of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Madi al-Kinani, and four others, a military source said.Al-Ahd, the militia's television channel, confirmed Kinani's death on Thursday, when he was buried in the Shi'ite holy city of Najaf, south of the capital Baghdad.A police source in Salahuddin province, where Tikrit is located, said an eight-vehicle convoy of Islamic State insurgents attacked Iraqi forces at dawn on Thursday in al-Muaibidi, east of al-Alam. The source said the army returned fire, killing four militants and burning two of their cars.An online video published early on Thursday purported to show Islamic State militants in Tikrit and al-Alam, taunting their attackers.""Here we stand in central Tikrit, that's the mosque of the martyrs behind us... You claimed, as usual that you raided the Sunnis and their homes and have claimed al-Dour, al-Jalam, al-Alam, Tikrit and others. By God, you have lied,"" a fighter said.In Baghdad, 10 people were killed on Thursday in a series of bomb attacks and mortar fire, police and medical sources said.The deadliest incidents were in the southeastern, Sunni neighborhood of Nahrawan where three people were killed by a bomb in a market, and the northern district of Rashidiya where three soldiers were killed by two roadside bombs.

Sittenfeld announced in January that he's running for U.S. Senate in Ohio. Currently in his second term as a Cincinnati City Council member, P.G. is especially interested in education and helping working and middle class families achieve financial stability -- but that's stuff you can find out by looking at his website. What I can tell you is what it's like to be his sister.When I was in my twenties, before I got married, I used to regularly get dating advice from P.G. The slightly weird part of this story is that he's nine years younger than I am -- meaning that, yes, I was relying on the wisdom of a teenage boy, a subset of the population not often recognized for great sensitivity, to help guide me through one of life's most delicate and important matters. But here's the thing: Just as he is now, P.G. then was really smart, he was honest, and he was practical. If he thought I was wasting my time with a guy, he'd say so. If he thought I needed to more clearly convey my interest, he'd tell me that, too. Plus, whenever he called, he'd crack me up by saying when I answered the phone, ""Sittenfeld, this is Sittenfeld."" So in my defense -- if you had a 15-year-old brother like that, you also might have sought out his insights into the mysteries of courtship and the male mind.Of course, I like to think sibling advice-dispensing is a two-way street. In fact, in order to understand P.G., you need to know that in addition to being the son of two warm, intelligent parents, he's the younger brother of three sisters: not just me, but our sister Tiernan, who's eleven years older than P.G., and our sister Jo, who's four years older. (And no, our parents didn't want only sons -- they just were way ahead of celebrities with the weird-baby-name phenomenon.)Having three older sisters doesn't just mean that a bewildered five-year-old P.G. was once convinced to try on a yellow dress in a Benetton store or that he has an impressive ability to quote from the movie Dirty Dancing, though both those things are true. Having three sisters also has much more significant implications. It means P.G. welcomes and truly listens to the ideas and opinions of women. It means that he recognizes that women have concerns about issues of health or compensation that can differ from men's -- a realization that you'd think in 2015 isn't that unusual, but among elected officials, it turns out to be rather noteworthy. When P.G. first ran for Cincinnati City Council, I admit that I wrestled with a question others are now expressing about P.G.'s Senate run: Given his age, I wondered if P.G. was jumping the gun. But even by the time P.G. won his first City Council election, I'd become a total believer, and my faith in him has only strengthened during his two terms. I've seen that without a doubt, P.G. genuinely cares about the community he's part of, down to the nitty-grittiest levels: He loves helping to fix problems as small and prosaic as a pothole and as big as a school that's not serving its students. And his age is an advantage -- he has a huge amount of energy, he's progressive about social issues, and he actually knows how to send his own tweets. One of the things P.G. has done that I'm personally most proud of happened in the fall of 2012. As the election approached, billboards went up in predominantly black neighborhoods in Cincinnati sending threatening and confusing warnings about voter fraud, warnings clearly meant to discourage any voting on the part of people living in these communities. P.G. was rightly appalled at the discrimination and reached out to a national billboard company who donated billboards all over the city that had red, white, and blue backgrounds and said: HEY CINCINNATI, VOTING IS A RIGHT, NOT A CRIME.Here's what else P.G.'s résumé can't capture: how friendly and funny he is, and how hard-working and curious. He genuinely loves being a public servant. As a writer, I've purposely chosen a profession that allows me to spend my days sitting in a room alone, but if you look up the word ""gregarious"" in the dictionary, you just might find a picture of P.G. He'd be delighted to share a meal of sloppy Cincinnati chili with you no matter who you are -- a college student, a firefighter, a fiftysomething woman or a male senior citizen. He even gets a kick out of those ceremonial occasions, like riding up in a cherry-picker to light a twenty-foot menorah, or using enormous scissors to cut the ribbon at the opening of a community center. When I heard recently that a longtime political consultant named Jerry Austin had said P.G. displays ""political talent"" he and others hadn't seen in nearly 40 years, I wasn't surprised. P.G. has an ineffable quality that you can't buy and you can't fake -- there's a perfect match among his talents, passions, and responsibilities. He's doing exactly what he was put on earth to do.   I know P.G. well enough to realize that he's far from perfect (I'll spare you the story of the epically huge fight we got into inside a K-mart in 1999, but trust me -- he was wrong and I was right). I also know P.G. well enough to believe unequivocally that he'll make an excellent senator.

Sittenfeld announced in January that he's running for U.S. Senate in Ohio. Currently in his second term as a Cincinnati City Council member, P.G. is especially interested in education and helping working and middle class families achieve financial stability -- but that's stuff you can find out by looking at his website. What I can tell you is what it's like to be his sister.When I was in my twenties, before I got married, I used to regularly get dating advice from P.G. The slightly weird part of this story is that he's nine years younger than I am -- meaning that, yes, I was relying on the wisdom of a teenage boy, a subset of the population not often recognized for great sensitivity, to help guide me through one of life's most delicate and important matters. But here's the thing: Just as he is now, P.G. then was really smart, he was honest, and he was practical. If he thought I was wasting my time with a guy, he'd say so. If he thought I needed to more clearly convey my interest, he'd tell me that, too. Plus, whenever he called, he'd crack me up by saying when I answered the phone, ""Sittenfeld, this is Sittenfeld."" So in my defense -- if you had a 15-year-old brother like that, you also might have sought out his insights into the mysteries of courtship and the male mind.Of course, I like to think sibling advice-dispensing is a two-way street. In fact, in order to understand P.G., you need to know that in addition to being the son of two warm, intelligent parents, he's the younger brother of three sisters: not just me, but our sister Tiernan, who's eleven years older than P.G., and our sister Jo, who's four years older. (And no, our parents didn't want only sons -- they just were way ahead of celebrities with the weird-baby-name phenomenon.)Having three older sisters doesn't just mean that a bewildered five-year-old P.G. was once convinced to try on a yellow dress in a Benetton store or that he has an impressive ability to quote from the movie Dirty Dancing, though both those things are true. Having three sisters also has much more significant implications. It means P.G. welcomes and truly listens to the ideas and opinions of women. It means that he recognizes that women have concerns about issues of health or compensation that can differ from men's -- a realization that you'd think in 2015 isn't that unusual, but among elected officials, it turns out to be rather noteworthy. When P.G. first ran for Cincinnati City Council, I admit that I wrestled with a question others are now expressing about P.G.'s Senate run: Given his age, I wondered if P.G. was jumping the gun. But even by the time P.G. won his first City Council election, I'd become a total believer, and my faith in him has only strengthened during his two terms. I've seen that without a doubt, P.G. genuinely cares about the community he's part of, down to the nitty-grittiest levels: He loves helping to fix problems as small and prosaic as a pothole and as big as a school that's not serving its students. And his age is an advantage -- he has a huge amount of energy, he's progressive about social issues, and he actually knows how to send his own tweets. One of the things P.G. has done that I'm personally most proud of happened in the fall of 2012. As the election approached, billboards went up in predominantly black neighborhoods in Cincinnati sending threatening and confusing warnings about voter fraud, warnings clearly meant to discourage any voting on the part of people living in these communities. P.G. was rightly appalled at the discrimination and reached out to a national billboard company who donated billboards all over the city that had red, white, and blue backgrounds and said: HEY CINCINNATI, VOTING IS A RIGHT, NOT A CRIME.Here's what else P.G.'s résumé can't capture: how friendly and funny he is, and how hard-working and curious. He genuinely loves being a public servant. As a writer, I've purposely chosen a profession that allows me to spend my days sitting in a room alone, but if you look up the word ""gregarious"" in the dictionary, you just might find a picture of P.G. He'd be delighted to share a meal of sloppy Cincinnati chili with you no matter who you are -- a college student, a firefighter, a fiftysomething woman or a male senior citizen. He even gets a kick out of those ceremonial occasions, like riding up in a cherry-picker to light a twenty-foot menorah, or using enormous scissors to cut the ribbon at the opening of a community center. When I heard recently that a longtime political consultant named Jerry Austin had said P.G. displays ""political talent"" he and others hadn't seen in nearly 40 years, I wasn't surprised. P.G. has an ineffable quality that you can't buy and you can't fake -- there's a perfect match among his talents, passions, and responsibilities. He's doing exactly what he was put on earth to do.   I know P.G. well enough to realize that he's far from perfect (I'll spare you the story of the epically huge fight we got into inside a K-mart in 1999, but trust me -- he was wrong and I was right). I also know P.G. well enough to believe unequivocally that he'll make an excellent senator. I'm excited to share in this exciting journey for my brother and Ohio._________________ Curtis Sittenfeld is the author of the bestselling novels Sisterland, American Wife, Prep, and The Man of My Dreams, which have been translated into twenty-five languages."

At the risk of further straining the relationship between Israel and the Obama Administration, Netanyahu warned members of Congress against what he considers an ill-advised nuclear deal with Iran. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ec5f2100005002c96c28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Everything you need to know about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress Tuesday was the presence in the visitor's gallery of one man -- Sheldon Adelson.The gambling tycoon is the Godfather of the Republican Right. The party's presidential hopefuls line up to kiss his assets, scraping and bowing for his blessing, which when granted is bestowed with his signed checks. Data from both the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics and the Center for Public Integrity show that in the 2012 election cycle, Adelson and his wife Miriam (whose purse achieved metaphoric glory Tuesday when it fell from the gallery and hit a Democratic congressman) contributed $150 million to the GOP and its friends, including $93 million to such plutocracy-friendly super PACs as Karl Rove's American Crossroads, the Congressional Leadership Fund, the Republican Jewish Coalition Victory Fund, Winning Our Future (the pro-Newt Gingrich super PAC) and Restore Our Future (the pro-Mitt Romney super PAC).Yet there's no knowing for sure about all of the ""dark money"" contributed by the Adelsons -- so called because it doesn't have to be reported. Like those high-rise, multi-million dollar apartments in New York City purchased by oligarchs whose identity is hidden within perfectly legal shell organizations, dark money lets our politicians conveniently erase fingerprints left by their ink-stained (from signing all those checks) billionaire benefactors.But Sheldon Adelson was not only sitting in the House gallery on Tuesday because of the strings he pulls here in the United States. He is also the Daddy Warbucks of Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu is yet another of his beneficiaries -- not to mention an ideological soulmate. Although campaign finance reform laws are much more strict in Israel than here in the United States, Adelson's wealth has bought him what the historian and journalist Gershom Gorenberg calls ""uniquely pernicious"" influence.Adelson owns the daily Israel Hayom, a leading newspaper, as well as Makor Roshon, the daily newspaper of Israel's Zionist religious right and NRG, a news website. He gives Israel Hayom away for free in order to promote his hardline views -- the headline in the paper the day after Obama's re-election was ""The US Voted [for] Socialism.""More important, he uses the paper to bang the drum incessantly for Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud Party, under the reign of which Israel has edged closer and closer to theocracy. As Hebrew University economist Momi Dahan put it: ""De facto, the existence of a newspaper like Israel Hayom egregiously violates the law, because [Adelson] actually is providing a candidate with nearly unlimited resources.""Sheldon, meet Rupert.In fact, as Israel's March 17 election approaches, Adelson has increased the press run of Israel Hayom's weekend edition by 70 percent. The paper says it's to increase circulation and advertising, but rival newspaper Ha'aretz reports, ""Political sources are convinced the extra copies are less part of a business plan and more one to help Netanyahu's re-election bid."" Just like the timing of Netanyahu's ""State of the Union"" address to Congress this week was merely a coincidence, right? ""I deeply regret that some perceive my being here as political,"" Netanyahu told Congress. ""That was never my intention."" Of course.In Gershom Gorenberg's words, the prime minister ""enjoys the advantage of having a major newspaper in his camp that portrays the world as seen from his office: a world in which Israel is surrounded by enemies, including the president of the United States; in which peace negotiations are aimed at destroying Israel; in which Israel's left is aligned with all the hostile forces, and even rightists who oppose Netanyahu want to carry out a coup through the instrument of elections.""So Netanyahu gets the best of both of Adelson's worlds -- his powerful propaganda machine in Israel and his campaign cash here in the United States. Combined, they allow Netanyahu to usurp American foreign policy as he manipulates an obliging US Congress enamored of Adelson's millions, pushing it further to the right on Israel and the Middle East.There you have it: Not only is this casino mogul the unofficial head of the Republican Party in America (""he with the gold rules""), he is the uncrowned King of Israel -- David with a printing press and checkbook instead of a slingshot and a stone. All of this came to the fore in Netanyahu's speech on Tuesday: the US cannot determine its own policy in the Middle East and the majority in Congress are under the thumb of a foreign power.Like a King Midas colossus, Sheldon Adelson bestrides the cause of war and peace in the most volatile region of the world. And this is the man who -- at Yeshiva University in New York in 2013 -- denounced President Obama's diplomatic efforts with Iran and proposed instead that the United States drop an atomic bomb in the Iranian desert and then declare: ""See! The next one is in the middle of Tehran. So, we mean business. You want to be wiped out? Go ahead and take a tough position and continue with your nuclear development.""Everything you need to know about Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress Tuesday was the presence in the visitor's gallery of that man. We are hostage to his fortune."

OK, maybe not all of us, but certainly a healthy percentage do. Stereotypes carry a measure of truth, after all. Us gay dads are no different. We still spend a lot of money on clothes, appliances and travel, it's just that those clothes are now Onesies, the appliances are now Diaper Genies, and the travel is now to Disney World.And just like the rest of the modern world, we do a ton of shopping on Amazon. I've long been a subscriber to Amazon Prime, their frequent-shopper discount program. Then when my husband and I started stocking up for our soon-to-be adopted son, Amazon began sending us emails and peppering us with ads about their family-focused program, Amazon Mom. Being a two-dad family, it was a little annoying to see yet one more thing that made us feel invisible. However, we were still jumping through hoops to complete our adoption, and advocating in our home state to legalize same-sex marriage. We had more important battles to wage.Then a few years ago a stay-at-home dad named Jeffrey Harrington started a Change.org petition to get Amazon Mom changed to Amazon Family. It turns out that the exact same program that offers sweet deals on formula and diapers is already called Amazon Family in countries like Canada, the UK, Germany, Austria, France, and Japan. Is the U.S. really that backward that Amazon couldn't turn a profit with a program that's more inclusive and progressive? Naming it Amazon Family supports the idea that parents are the ones that change, feed, nurture, shelter, and shop for their children -- not only moms. Naming it Amazon Family reflects that the gender imbalance in parenting is slowly but surely evening out. And it reflects that not all families even have a mom. The petition was started a while ago, so why the big fuss now? Because a man named Oren Miller -- a popular dad blogger, an avid supporter of this cause, and a deeply committed straight ally -- died last week after a grueling battle with cancer. He was a stay-at-home father of two young children, and was a mere 42 years old. So I'm taking up his cause, and making it my own. And you should, too. Amazon usually knows better. They already have substantial non-discrimination policies in place, and offer full benefits for same-sex partners of their employees, scoring a 90 on the HRC Corporate Equality Index. Let's remind them of their already strong track record.Changing Amazon Mom to Amazon Family may just be about a word, but words mean something. Most of us in the LGBT community have been called words that meant something. As a (now) legally married man and the adoptive father of a 5-year-old boy, words mean something. Let's make this mean something, too.Since Oren's death, the petition has added nearly 1,500 signatures, and the hash tag #AmazonFamilyUS is trending on Twitter. Please add your name to the petition, add your voice on Twitter and other social media, and help get Amazon's attention so we can all get back to shopping -- as one big, happy, gay family.Read more from Brent Almond on his personal blog, Designer Daddy, or follow him on Twitter."

We are repeatedly told that claims of rape in conflict are exaggerated, that the victims do not want to speak about the violence because they would rather put it behind them, and that it's nearly impossible to prove the crime of sexual violence. We have heard it all.But the failure of investigators, prosecutors, and courts to seek justice for the victims has significant consequences. Remember the women held in sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War II? The International Military Tribunal for the Far East did not investigate these cases, which involved as many as 200,000 Asian women. At a war crimes tribunal held in Tokyo in 2000, 66 women survivors of sexual slavery from Burma, China, Guam, Indonesia, Malaysia, North Korea, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan, among others, described their lives of shame, rejection, and persistent physical and mental health problems and the struggle to keep their sanity as the world rewrote their experiences out of the historical record.At the International Criminal Court (ICC), there is a danger that the same erasure and denial is being imposed on victims of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the Lubanga case -- the first case to be decided by the ICC -- the prosecutor failed to bring charges of sexual enslavement and rape against Thomas Lubanga, a Congolese warlord charged with recruiting and using child soldiers, even as victims and witnesses included sexual violence as part of their testimony. Lubanga was ultimately convicted of war crimes for conscripting and enlisting children and using them to participate actively in hostilities, but when the court issued its judgment, the judges explicitly noted the prosecutor's failure to include charges of sexual violence despite the overwhelming evidence.Earlier this week, in another blow to these survivors, the ICC's appeals chamber rejected inclusion of victims of sexual and gender-based violence in the design of the reparations order. Justice is again being denied to the victims of sexual violence. And because the ICC failed to capture the full range of victims who suffered from Lubanga's crimes, the survivors will now be deprived appropriate reparations that would ensure them psychological and physical health care, access to programs for reintegration into their communities, and access to other rehabilitation assistance.It is horrific to be targeted for sexual violence in any context. To be targeted in conflict is to be used as a sacrificial pawn to sow fear in communities -- fear compounded by shame that may tear apart the lives of the victims, their families, and their communities. Justice matters, because in acknowledging the harm and demanding accountability for the perpetrators, a community is taking its first step in repairing that harm. Justice denied prolongs the pain and exacerbates suffering. History matters, because when we fail to confront our history, we are too often doomed to repeat it.There is no excuse for courts to fail the victims of sexual violence. As Physicians for Human Rights has demonstrated in its work in eastern Congo, doctors, nurses, police investigators, prosecutors, and judges can work together to support evidence-based prosecutions for crimes of sexual violence.The ICC should know better.

My teacher's words murmuring to me, ""Bring yoga into your life in whatever way you can,"" I creep downstairs in the dark, huddled into a purple fleece robe, slippers on my feet, and take my place in the overstuffed living room chair. ""Focus on the breath,"" I tell myself. ""Be curious. In and out. Do not grow attached."" I have found it helpful to return to the ritual I did not know I had forsaken until one day I realized it had dropped from the contours of my life. Was it before we moved to Ohio? Before the birth of our third child? There was a time I had a robust yoga practice, but that era feels long ago. My yoga studio was on the corner of 86th and York, in Manhattan, around the corner from my home and the school where I taught for 20 years. And classes seemed to fit magically into my schedule. A 4:45 Vinyasa class that had me walking through the door of my apartment at 6:00 p.m. just before our babysitter had to go home; an 8:00 a.m. weekend class that had me back at home before my young daughters were more than semi-conscious in front of our 12-inch TV. In those days, I had a headstand; my body felt free and light and biddable, and, for a brief time, I was free of judgment, fully absorbed in the joy of the mat, the smooth forgiving floor, the breath. I changed. I relished letting go, following the ritual. Begin with Ohm. Sun salutations. Downward dog. Knees, chest and chin. Warrior One. Triangle. Tree Pose. Eagle. Pigeon. Bridge, plough, shoulder stand, half wheel. Finally, once I was strong enough: head stand. And, at the end, always gorgeous shavasana. After 9/11, I took refuge at the studio. I remember now, 13 years later, our calm young instructor saying then, ""All you have to do is be here now. Just breathe."" Just breathe. For an hour, the familiarity of the practice reassured me. It was predictable. On the mat, tears streaked down my temples into my hair. For the tragedy, of course. For all the uncertainty I felt. For fear of what would happen to us all. And then, I would wiggle my toes and fingers, roll to my right side, and curl up to a seated position, chanting Ohm again, my voice blending with the resonance of this group of strangers. All the years that I took class there, I never knew many names of the other women who practiced with me. There was a calm anonymity and rhythm. Faces grew familiar, but there was no pressure, no scene to maintain, no Lulu Lemon so long ago. I would step back into the stream of my life, equipped to manage.It was in yoga class that I suspected I might be pregnant with my late-life ""bonus"" baby. In headstand, the world began to spin. Inversions can stir up all kinds of things, I knew, but this felt a little dangerous. Carefully, I came down, and during shavasana, instead of floating, I made a plan to stop at the drugstore on the way home. A blue line, instantly. I took some prenatal classes, but that was the beginning of the end of that chapter, the end of our New York life. In Cleveland, months later -- new baby, new city, new job -- I did not find a new yoga home. I was distracted, overwhelmed, But then, Marni came to teach us at my school. It was a self-serving act. ""Let's have yoga after school,"" I suggested, ""on Wednesdays, for faculty and staff."" Maybe that way I could manage at least one class a week. There were no scheduled meetings in the middle of the week.So on Wednesdays, for several years at 4:00 p.m., I felt I had come home again -- the setting not a lovely studio, but either a room in the school's basement that smelled a bit like feet or the dance studio, replete with music blaring from the girls' basketball practice below, but the feeling was familiar, comforting. And then I screwed up my shoulder and, after that, my knee, and soon staying away had become the habit instead of rolling out my mat. Two, three years? How could this have happened? How did I let go of what I loved? This fall, Marni stopped by my office one Wednesday afternoon, took a Hershey's Kiss from the jar I keep filled for my Laurel girls, and looked at me closely, gently. Instead of scolding me for staying away, she reminded me to do what I can do. To do what I can do. So I began to meditate again. Quietly, without telling anyone in particular. In the winter morning dark, I come downstairs. I settle myself in the living room chair. And there, I breathe. In. Out. Watching the breath, turning my focus inward. Two? Three? Ten minutes? Each day is different. I try not to judge, to forgive myself on the mornings when it's hard to quiet my mind. Next, I go to the kitchen and feed our three small dogs, so delighted every morning to see me. And I wash out the cats' bowls -- only two of them -- and carry the black cat from the cellar door to the counter on which his food waits. He is afraid of the dogs, though his brave grey brother has no such trepidation. Once the menagerie is fed, I write. Next, I empty the dishwasher, start the coffee and spend a few minutes looking out the kitchen window, seeing light begin in the Eastern sky. Recently, I've been watering the paper white narcissus bulbs, taking root in pebbles, stretching upward, their fragrance delicate, full of promise. This quiet kitchen time with the day stretched before me is a kind of listening. The joining yoga invites. I like the ritual, the practice. I am not stretching as I once did on the mat, but slowly, I am coming back. Soon, I will find my Warrior One again."

Later he moved on to projects in Brentwood, TN, Great Barrington, Evansville, IN, MA, Orlando, FL, Kansas City, KA, Bellingham, WA, Plano,TX, Manchester, VT and many in NJ and North Carolina.And he remains hard at work, modifying an historic temple in Jersey City whose congregation shrunk from about 750 families to about 250 families in a few years, and even renovating a black Orthodox Jewish congregation in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.Asked if he should have stayed in the more lucrative corporate world, designing some of the projects he worked on when he was just starting out, Landau said, ""Should I have done that? I don't think so. There are so many other kinds of rewards in what I do now.""Temple Israel, Orlando, FLWith special thanks to Joe Seldner."

Actually, we don't say it; we sort of sing it to the rhythm of 'peek-a-boo,' except we ask, ""Whose turn is it?"" My daughter will giggle and answer with either ""Daddy's turn!"" or ""Mommy's turn!"" The lucky recipient gets to read her a story and tuck her into bed.   I'm not going to lie; there are many times when I am fervently hoping that she will pick Daddy. Then again, sometimes she will go for long stretches of picking Daddy and I start to feel like the last kid picked for dodge ball in gym class. Last Monday night, she picked me.We sat together in our oversized rocking chair and read a book. When it was finished, I turned off the light and held her against my chest. It always surprises me how during the day -- with her giant personality -- she can appear larger than life. However, when I hold her tiny 2 ½ year old body against mine and gently rock her, she still feels like a newborn baby.This is my favorite part of Mommy's turn. Sometimes she will just relax, other times, she mentions funny tidbits from her day. That night, she asked me a question.""Mommy, what does 'die' mean?""I held my breath. The weight and intensity of the question lay like bricks on my chest. My father-in-law had passed away only two weeks prior. His death was unexpected. Our oldest child was extremely close to his grandfather, who we all called Grampy. At 13, he was the perfect age to share in Grampy's hobbies; hunting and fishing. Admittedly, not high-interest sports for his 2-year-old sister. Grampy had a boisterous voice, and my daughter usually hid upstairs for a while when he came to visit. After he died, my husband and I were concerned about our son; this was his first experience with death. We tried to help him see it as a process and natural part of the life cycle. To assist with the grieving process, a friend recommended we work together on a scrapbook so that he could ""see"" all his favorite memories and feel comfortable talking about them. What we neglected were the little ears in the next room that had been listening all week.After what felt like an eternity, I responded simply, ""Die is when you go up to heaven."" Without missing a beat, my daughter replied, ""Mommy, Grampy is dead. He's dead."" Her words cut through my chest and left a raw pain. I thought she was just too young to understand what was going on. She and Grampy rarely saw each other. She never asked about him, and candidly, I didn't think she would even remember him a month from now. I was wrong. I was wrong. I was so very wrong. It never occurred to me that her little brain was trying to put together the pieces and understand the immense sadness that filled our house. She just didn't have the communication skills.   ""Yes, honey, he is."" I finally replied,"" Grampy is up in heaven now.""""Grampy is hurt."" She whispered softly. ""He's sad.""""No honey,"" I explained, ""Grampy was sick, but now he's in heaven and he's all better. He doesn't hurt anymore.""""Grampy not hurt anymore. He's in heaven. He's happy."" She repeated the words in her sweet little voice. Even in the dark, I could see her blue eyes processing all the new information. That was enough for tonight. If I remember her next comment correctly, it was something about Elmo.I told my husband the story when I came downstairs, and I knew from the pale look on his face that he was as shocked as I was. Over the course of the next few days, my daughter continued to ask us questions, and randomly reiterate the information. For seemingly no reason at all, she would loudly announce, ""Grampy is dead. Yeah, he's dead."" It was strange and a painful to hear her say those words; so factual was her tone that at times it felt sickeningly cruel. A few times she said it when we were in public, and I immediately felt as though I was being unclothed. This was a fresh wound, and not one I wanted to share with the produce aisle at Whole Foods. I answered with a quick cheerful, ""That's right sweetie!"" and then immediately redirected her to something else. ""Now look at these grapes, would you like green or purple grapes?"" Last night I was setting the table for Sunday dinner. I wanted to cheer everyone up after the somber events of the past few weeks. I made an Italian family favorite -- chicken parmesan, homemade pasta and a big antipasto salad. In the drawer where I keep our special napkins, I found the place settings we use on holidays. The top one was still filled out from Thanksgiving with the words ""Grampy.""""He's really dead."" I whispered to myself, and felt a tear slide down my face. I guess we all had our ways of reminding ourselves about his absence. Regardless of our age, we all understood that his life was important, beautiful, imperfect, worthy of our love and deserving of our grief. We just had different ways of communicating our grief. Postscript:I wrote this article four years ago shortly after my father-in-law passed away. My daughter is now almost 7, and still reminisces about her grandfather on a weekly basis. I can't believe how much she recalls about his life; part memories and part stories we've recounted so many times, they've become real to her. In the book I co-authored titled The Learning Habit, I included a chapter on communication called Message Sent = Message Received. My favorite quote from the chapter is from Peter Drucker, a management consultant, educator and author: ""The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said.""This Blogger's Book...

(Photo By Bill Clark/Roll Call via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ec142200004301dd8256.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former for-profit college students who publicly announced a ""debt strike"" have gained a prominent endorsement from an influential member of Congress.Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said Tuesday she supports the 15 former students who declared last week they won't make payments on their federal student loans. Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, is the first member of Congress to publicly endorse the actions of the striking debtors, who refuse to repay loans taken out to attend schools owned by Corinthian Colleges Inc., the troubled owner of schools that the U.S. Department of Education recently bailed out.The so-called Corinthian 15 claim Corinthian's schools lured them into enrolling and taking out loans by advertising false job placement rates. The borrowers are relying in part on the master promissory note, which acts as a contract between student borrowers and the federal government, that they signed when they took out the loans. The note contains a provision that may cancel borrowers' debts if they can show that misrepresentation led them to take out the loans.Lawsuits by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and state attorneys general in California, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin may help their cause. In separate suits filed in recent years, authorities allege that Corinthian fraudulently induced students to take out loans to attend its schools by misleading them about future job prospects. The company has denied the accusations.The striking debtors have been in touch with federal officials, but have yet to receive public support. The Education Department, in a statement last week, encouraged them to make good on their debts. Waters is likely the first federal official from any government branch to endorse their strike.The former Corinthian students ""have decided that this is predatory lending and they're not going to repay their debts,"" Waters said. ""They're organizing, and I support them.""The debt strike has brought renewed attention to the Education Department's lackluster efforts at protecting the integrity of the federal student loan system, and its inattention to the plight of borrowers in distress. The Education Department allows schools to generate tens of billions of dollars in annual revenues through taxpayer-backed loans and grants to students. In return, the department is supposed to ensure, for example, that schools aren't misleading students about their graduation or job placement rates.But in the case of Corinthian, which is slowly dismantling itself as a result of numerous federal and state investigations into alleged wrongdoing, student advocates claim the Education Department effectively turned a blind eye to mounting evidence that students were being misled into taking out federal student loans.For example, in a January 2014 letter to Corinthian, Robin Minor, the Education Department's chief compliance officer, said the company had “admitted to falsifying placement rates” at many of its campuses, which along with other concerns, “suggest systemic deficiencies” throughout the company's several dozen campuses. Education Secretary Arne Duncan has repeated those claims in letters to federal lawmakers.The Education Department has since helped keep the company afloat while it finds buyers for its various schools, which operate under the Everest, Heald and Wyotech brands. Meanwhile, former students are left to fend for themselves.A group of Senate Democrats has called on the department to forgive debts owed by current and former Corinthian students. The Education Department has yet to respond to their demand."
