She is 13, now. Last week she provided me with a list of things that she is thankful for. It stopped me in my tracks.The very first thing at the top of her list was she was thankful that when it snowed, there wasn't snow on the floor of her house, anymore. Of course she said she was thankful that she could still be in a family with her biological siblings and that she was thankful for the rest of the family too. But there were other things that I take for granted. Sarah was thankful to have a bed. She was grateful for having clothes. She was glad that she didn't have to knock on doors and beg neighbors for food so she didn't starve. I need to tell you that I was a bit ashamed of my lack of demonstrated gratitude for my life of excess.I am not a person who thinks that children need to go to a rich country to be happy. I detest those who believe that families should be separated simply because of economic reasons, when loving parents don't have the ability to provide for their children. I believe that often the assistance we give to children does not need to be a new family, but helping the family they already have to survive. Whenever we can, we need to stop children from being orphans rather than finding them homes. Even so, a time in my daughter's life when she had nothing, caused me to realize all of the things that I am thankful for.Sarah's feelings on thankfulness are often complicated. She knows that many people expect her to be thankful for being adopted. Does that mean she should be thankful that her first family disintegrated? If she is thankful for her new parents, does that mean that she should hate her birth parents? Should she forget them? Should she never wish that they could have stopped their abusive ways and kept their seven children together?Sometimes Sarah is thankful. Sometimes she is angry. Sometimes my daughter is thankful and angry at the same time. But every time I hear someone talk about the things my adopted children should be thankful for, I realize the things that I need to appreciate. When I hear that my daughter should be thankful for her new parents, I remember that I never had to go through the heartbreak of a broken family. When I hear that she should be thankful that she always has enough to eat, now, I am embarrassingly aware of the fact that I never starved. When people tell my daughter that she should be thankful that she and her three biological sisters were adopted into the same family, I thank God that unlike Sarah, I never have to wonder what happened to my other three siblings. When I hear that she should be thankful for the big, warm house that she lives in, and for the economic cornucopia that is now hers, I am humbly and almost reverently grateful that I never lived in a house where it snowed on the floor. When I hear that my daughter should be thankful that she now lives in the United States, I smile at the naivet√© of people who have never seen happiness in a poor family from a poverty-stricken country.I am thankful for all nine of our children. I am grateful for those born to us biologically, and for those who joined our family through domestic and international adoptions. I am thankful for an incredible wife, who also came from a broken home, who understands my children and who tries to help them move on with their lives. Most of all, I am thankful for people who have ""had not"" and their patience with those of us who have always ""had,"" when we tell them what they should be thankful for.

1,TRAVEL,Kennedy's Cold War Island Bunker Is Now A Museum,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kennedys-cold-war-island_us_5b9dab3ce4b03a1dcc8b261a,"From his boyhood on, Kennedy's family was a fixture in the ritzy, oceanside enclave where billionaire investors like William",2013-11-19,"ADVANCE FOR MONDAY, JUNE 7, 1999--Tourist Eleanor Welch visits a bunker Wednesday, May 19, 1999, that would have been President John F. Kennedy's fallout shelter, 25 feet underneath Peanut Island in the middle of Lake Worth on the southeast Fla., coast in case of nuclear troubles during his presidency. Kennedy, whose family estate was on nearby Palm Beach Island, visited the bunker once. At the right is an office area from which all major decisions in the Free World would have been taken. (AP Photo/Chris Matula)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dab3c2000002d00fe0d96.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Zachary FagensonPEANUT ISLAND, Fla., Nov 19 (Reuters) - The dingy, cavernous steel fallout shelter hastily built on a man-made island off Florida's east coast is a stark reminder of the harsh realities President John F. Kennedy faced from the first days of his presidency at the height of the Cold War.As the Kennedy family vacationed minutes away at the Palm Beach compound known as the Winter White House, the shelter's main chamber sat ready at a moment's notice with 15 sets of bunk beds, a desk for the president and a conference table.The heavily protected hideaway, fully stocked with military K rations, barrels of water and radiation detection kits, could serve as home for 30 of Kennedy's family and key staff for a month in the event of a nuclear attack.""They tested bringing him here,"" said Anthony Miller, general manager of Palm Beach Maritime Museum, which maintains the shelter. ""It was 10 minutes from his front door on Palm Beach to here.""Shortly before Kennedy took office in January 1961, Navy Seabees undertook ""Operation Hotel"" and in 10 days piled 25 feet (7.6 metres) of earth, lead and concrete above the corrugated steel bunker.Half a century after Kennedy's assassination during a Dallas motorcade, his memory lingers in Palm Beach.From his boyhood on, Kennedy's family was a fixture in the ritzy, oceanside enclave where billionaire investors like William Koch rub shoulders with wealthy entertainers such as singer Jimmy Buffett.The Honey Fitz, the yacht that served Presidents Truman through Nixon, still moors in the waters near the once-secret shelter. The 80-year-old wooden boat is a floating museum and travels regularly between Palm Beach and Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.""All the footage you see of JFK out on the water during his presidency was on this boat and all of the still photos were taken on it,"" said Paul Ocepek, the Honey Fitz's first officer. ESCAPE HATCH, HELIPADGetting to the fallout shelter's main living quarters required passing through a series of narrow passages that held a generator, air pumps and filters, a radiation detector and a sterilization chamber.At the back of the largest room was an emergency escape hatch that led to a helipad in case the shelter itself came under attack. The U.S. government did not acknowledge its existence until 1974.The island where it sits was dredged up from the Palm Beach inlet in 1918 to serve as a port for peanut oil shipping.Although that business failed, the name of Peanut Island remained. It was closed to the public from the time the Coast Guard took it over in 1936 in preparation for World War Two until 1995, when the museum secured a 45-year lease on the property.At the time, the shelter was partially flooded and in disrepair, Miller said. Nearly all of its contents had been removed or destroyed.The museum opened to the public in 1999, and efforts continue to restore the bunker to its original condition.The steel hatch that leads to a dark, downward sloping steel tube was once hidden from sight by a thicket of trees. Miller said he planned to replant the trees, which for visitors will recreate the dramatic effect of stumbling upon the entrance in a small hill.Despite the long-lasting interest in the Kennedys and their fairy-tale image, maintaining the shelter remains a challenge. It sees about 12,000 visitors annually and relies on volunteer efforts to help with maintenance.It receives no financial contributions from the federal government or the Kennedy family, even though Ethel Kennedy, the widow of slain former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, visits the bunker almost every year with her grandchildren. (Editing by David Adams and Jim Loney)"
