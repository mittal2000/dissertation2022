""What we are looking at in these museum restorations is the society’s superego, what a society thinks of itself, and how it thinks it should be seen by itself. This is what individuals do to a room… It’s the exteriorisation of the soul life or of personal values,"" he says.According to Yatzer, Polidori began his fascination with Versailles after winning an exclusive contract to document the restoration of the seventeenth-century palace in the mid-1980’s. Since then, he's captured Versailles' centuries of wear and tear and the massive undertaking of restoring the space.In 2009, Polidori published several hundred photographs from his project in a three-volume book called, Parcours Muséologique Revisité. Take a look at some of his images below or at the Mary Boone Gallery through October 26.Have something to say?

(Photo by Ted Thai//Time Life Pictures/Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d9f192000004e00fe092c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Toni ClarkeWASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday recommended tighter restrictions on products that contain hydrocodone, an opioid painkiller present in commonly prescribed, potentially addictive drugs such as Vicodin.Until now, Vicodin and other products that contain less than 15 milligrams of hydrocodone have been classified as Schedule III controlled substances. The FDA recommends reclassifying them more restrictively -- potentially as Schedule II products, in line with opioid pain-killers such as oxycodone and morphine.Reclassifying the products would make them harder to obtain, both by addicts and by legitimate pain patients. Physicians are not allowed to call in a prescription for a Schedule II product to a pharmacy. Instead, patients must present a written prescription.In addition, patients would not be allowed as many refills before returning to see their doctors, potentially representing a hardship for patients in chronic pain.The proposed change was urged by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which is battling a rising tide of prescription drug abuse. The change must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services and the DEA, which will make a final scheduling decision.Opponents of the rule change, including many physicians, have argued for years that restricting pain products further could cause hardship to pain patients, especially the elderly.Proponents argue that the death toll from abuse is unacceptably high.Nearly three of four prescription drug overdoses are caused by opioid pain-killers, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Regulators are trying to tackle the problem from a variety of angles. In an attempt to restrict supply, the DEA has been putting pressure on wholesale suppliers of prescription drugs to police their customers better.Several companies, including Pfizer Inc and Endo Health Solutions, have been working to develop tamper resistant opioids that cannot be easily crushed or dissolved by addicts looking to get a full dose of the drug quickly.The misuse of prescription pain-killers was responsible for more than 475,000 emergency department visits in 2009, a number that nearly doubled in just five years, according to the CDC.In January a panel of outside medical experts voted 19 to 10 to reclassify the products. The vote followed two days of discussions.Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's pharmaceuticals division, said in a statement that the agency has, over the past few years, been ""challenged with determining how to balance the need to ensure continued access to those patients who rely on continuous pain relief while addressing the ongoing concerns about abuse and misuse.""In the end, she said, the level of opioid abuse and the ""tremendous amount of public interest"" in the matter led the agency to recommend a change.

In a detailed analysis of the 35-year-old man's case, scientists from the Zhejiang Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said it differed from previous ones in that it was a severe case in a younger patient ""with no obvious underlying diseases and no obvious recent direct contact with live poultry"".Most laboratory-confirmed cases in the past had been people over the age of 60, many of whom said they'd had recent exposure to poultry, generally at live bird markets.The case of the 35-year-old man, plus another H7N9 infection confirmed just a day ago, suggest the virus ""has apparently continued to circulate in an animal reservoir during the summer"", the researchers said.The second October case is a 67-year-old man with no underlying disease whose work included transporting and selling poultry.The researchers said that based on China's experience in the spring, when there were 30 cases in March and 88 in April, the best approach now would be to maintain enhanced and expanded surveillance in human and animal populations to make sure any new cases of H7N9 are picked up and diagnosed swiftly.""In particular, enhanced surveillance in poultry would be helpful if it can identify the H7N9 virus and inform early control measures before human infections occur,"" the Chinese scientists said.""Hygiene campaigns and closure of live poultry markets can reduce the risk of severe cases and deaths.""

Of course, you should never choose a design based solely on what's in vogue; first and foremost, you should love it and want to see it every day. Trends come and go, and a kitchen defines your lifestyle. That said, it's always interesting and exciting to survey the latest looks, technologies, and design trends, and see if any of it feels right for you. Here are the top four trends in cabinetry that I'm seeing in kitchens today, and that I'm personally enjoying incorporating into my own designs. Exotic Wood VeneersOne of the most versatile and stunning trends in kitchens is the use of exotic wood veneers, thin slices that showcase the wood's natural grain. I talked with one of my longtime colleagues Andy Tobias about what she's seeing. ""In contemporary designs, people are using veneers to create interest,"" she says, using the example of a cabinet door with a veneer center panel in an otherwise spare design. Veneers are nothing new, but what I find truly exciting and inspiring is the range of interesting and exotic woods now available. There's the African species Bubinga (also known as African Rosewood), which has a rich, reddish color and darker purplish waves. The Southeast Asian Paldao is a lighter wood, often tan or light grey, with dark stripes, while the European Larch can be a warm red, rich and dramatic chestnut, or subdued brown.  Photo courtesy of St Charles of New York I love using veneers in a variety of ways, from accent pieces to full cabinet treatments. In all our kitchens with full cabinet veneers, you'll see the figure, or pattern on the wood matched to create a cohesive overall look, and it's exceptionally beautiful.Here is a kitchen with fumed oak veneer cabinets. Photo courtesy of St Charles of New York A Range of ChoicesAnother reason why I love working with veneers in these exquisite wood varieties is the range of looks one can achieve with them. Depending on the cut, finish, or treatment (such as fuming), the same wood can appear entirely different. They also work well for horizontal applications. White KitchensWhite kitchens might be far from cutting-edge; they've been popular forever. But the shade of white on the rise is bright, crisp and clean, not the off-white that's been so popular in recent years. Here's an example of a ""new look"" white kitchen, a project we designed that utilizes bright white cabinets.  Photo courtesy of St Charles of New York Regardless of the material used, this minimalist color trend dovetails very nicely with the increased popularity of streamlined designs. I'm creating more and more kitchens featuring clean lines and simple silhouettes across all styles -- contemporary, transitional, and traditional. Milk Paint FinishFor kitchens of a more traditional design, I've been using cabinets in what's known as a milk paint finish, and it's a style that's increasingly popular. One of the nice features of this elegant finish is that the brushstroke is easier to touch up.For this technique, paint is applied in two layers, a base and a topcoat, for a subtle, tone-on-tone look. ""It has the appearance of hand-painting because it is.""Mixing white and darkMore than ever, I'm seeing kitchen designs that feature contrast, and mixing light and dark elementsis a technique I've enjoyed using for a while. You might think this would be jarring to the eye, but it can actually be quite subtle, or provide just the thing to anchor a space or provide some excitement.  Photo courtesy of St Charles of New York This kitchen design is one where a dark element -- in this case, a walnut island topped with the semi-precious grey agate counter -- provides a pleasing counterpoint to its surroundings in white marble, wood and commercial-grade glass tile. I'm proud to say this kitchen took first place in the 2012 Global Sub-Zero and Wolf Kitchen Design Contest."
