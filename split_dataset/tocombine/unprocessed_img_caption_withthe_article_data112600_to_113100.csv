Lavell Ford is the brother of Ezell Ford. Police say that Ford had attempted to remove a gun from an officer's holster on Monday when he was shot and killed, which differs from accounts by the family of the man. (AP Photo/Mark J.

The 25-year-old's fatal shooting by two LAPD officers Monday night, mere days after the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, made him into an emblem of police brutality and racial injustice: another sad rallying cry in the movement for reform.But for Tritobia and Edsell Ford, both 42, Ezell Ford will always be a beloved eldest son. On Friday, at the home where they raised him and his siblings, dressed in funeral black, they bemoaned their child's tragic early death. ""We're so devastated,"" Edsell Ford, Ezell's father, said. ""It's horrible what happened.""""He was snatched away from us,"" Tritobia Ford, his mother, said while shaking her head. ""He was so young. I didn't even get to have grandchildren.""A basketball net stood unused in front of the family home, in the shadow of the 110 Freeway. Tritobia Ford said her son had loved to play basketball since he was a little boy. She described him as kind and ""free-spirited.""""He didn't look at life the same way as other people,"" she said. Tritobia Ford said her son's distance from others grew as he got older. She doesn't recall anything particularly unusual about his behavior as a young boy, but when he was a teenager, he started to exhibit signs of the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia that run in her family, she said.""Maybe it was always in him,"" she said. ""But it peaked when he was about 18."" Ezell's friends and neighbors supported this picture with recollections of a sweet boy who became increasingly troubled as he aged. Shirley Benitez, 24, said she has lived two doors down from the Fords since she was 9, and remembers playing with Ezell and his younger brothers constantly when they were kids. ""We used to play in the street together, all of us,"" she said. ""It was so much fun. We were really close. We all went to middle school together, right in the neighborhood."" Benitez said she and Ezell drifted apart after middle school because they attended different high schools. She went to Venice High, and he went to University High in West LA, she said. University High Principal Eric Davidson said Ezell attended the school until 10th grade, but he wasn't sure where he went afterward.Benitez said she recalled hearing Ezell was having troubles with his mental health in high school, but said she was never clear on exactly what that meant. Ezell continued to greet her warmly whenever they would see each other around the neighborhood, but something seemed different about him, she said.""He was always so sweet and polite,"" she said, ""but whenever I would see him, he was almost always by himself."" Ashanti Harrison, 31, another friend of Ezell's who lives two blocks away from the family, said he was a popular, normal teenager who loved to dance and play basketball. In more recent years, Harrison said, he had mostly seen Ezell walking around alone.""He never bothered anybody,"" Harrison said. ""He would walk up and down the street for hours just asking people for cigarettes."" Harrison said Ezell was walking alone the last time he saw him. On Monday evening, Harrison said he was showering in his second-floor apartment on 65th Street when he saw Ezell walking down the street. A police car pulled over, and two male cops who were larger than Ezell got out, Harrison said.Harrison said Ezell looked frightened and confused. A struggled ensued, and the officers ended up wrestling Ezell to the ground and shooting him three times. He was pronounced dead at the hospital that night.Four days later, Ezell's parents expressed hope that justice would be served in the case of their son's death. ""We just want to see something done,"" Tritobia Ford said.A protest over Ezell Ford's death is planned to take place at LAPD headquarters downtown on Sunday at 3 p.m."

(AP) — Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday ordered a federal medical examiner to perform another autopsy on a black Missouri teenager whose fatal shooting by a white police officer has spurred a week of rancorous and sometimes-violent protests in suburban St. Louis.The ""extraordinary circumstances"" surrounding the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown and a request by Brown's family members prompted the order, Department of Justice spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.""This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,"" Fallon said. ""Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.""The Justice Department already had deepened its civil rights investigation into the shooting. Officials said a day earlier that 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door gathering information in the Ferguson, Missouri, neighborhood where Brown, who was unarmed, was shot to death Aug. 9 in the street.David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of Miami's U.S. Attorney's office, said a federally conducted autopsy ""more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises"" might help that investigation, and that the move is ""not that unusual.""He also said federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case.President Barack Obama, who has been getting regular updates on the situation in Ferguson while on vacation, was to be briefed by Holder upon returning Monday to the White House.The Justice Department's announcement followed the first night of a state-imposed curfew in Ferguson, which ended with tear gas and seven arrests after police dressed in riot gear used armored vehicles to disperse defiant protesters.Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said protesters were not the reason for the escalated police reaction early Sunday after the midnight curfew took effect. He cited a report of people who had broken into a barbecue restaurant and taken to the roof, and a man who flashed a handgun in the street as armored vehicles approached the crowd of protesters.At a Sunday afternoon rally, Johnson said he had met members of Brown's family and the experience ""brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart.""""When this is over,"" he told the crowd, ""I'm going to go in my son's room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that's my baby.""Johnson added: ""We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael's going to make it better for our sons to be better black men.""The Rev. Al Sharpton told the rally Brown's death was a ""defining moment for this country.""Sharpton said he wants Congress to stop programs that provide military-style weaponry to police departments. He said he expects police to ""smear"" the slain teenager, his family and his attorneys.He also condemned the recent spate of violence and looting in Ferguson.As the sun began to set Sunday, the protests had a party-like atmosphere, with crowds lining the street in front of buildings that had been looted. Some people were barbequing outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that was destroyed earlier in the week.The protests have been going on since Brown's death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and mostly white Ferguson Police Department, leading to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompting Missouri's governor to put the state highway patrol in charge of security.Ferguson Police waited six days to publicly reveal the name of the officer and documents alleging Brown robbed a convenience store before he was killed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.Gov. Jay Nixon, who imposed the curfew after declaring a state of emergency, said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that he was not aware the police were going to release surveillance video from the store where Brown is alleged to have stolen a $49 box of cigars.""It's appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,"" Nixon said.Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.""When you're exhausted, when you're out of resources, when you're out of ammunition, you surrender,"" Brown's uncle, pastor Charles Ewing, told worshippers during a Sunday sermon at Jennings Mason Temple in Ferguson. ""He surrendered, and yet he died.""The officer who shot Brown was identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area. "
3,CRIME,Policing 'Stop and Frisk' With 'Stop and Track' Policing,"Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, ContributorLaw professor UDC David A.

Despite the Brown family's continued call for peaceful demonstrations, violent protests have erupted nearly every night in Ferguson since his death. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2a4183c00009e000aebd3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The events in Ferguson, Missouri between Officer Darren Wilson and Michael Brown are tragic, chaotic, and unfortunately part of a larger pattern of police-citizen conflict that occasionally escalates into deadly force. These events are also not simply about what happened on August 9, 2014, but about the growing distrust between citizens and the police who patrol that community. Ferguson has resonated across the country, not because of the merits of this one particular interaction -- where the facts are still uncertain -- but because of other similar, but less deadly policing tactics in certain urban communities. Calls for better police training, body-worn cameras, new racial profiling legislation, and/or federal investigations are welcome steps, but they all fail to capture the simmering day-to-day tension that is created by certain types of stop and frisk patrols. At their core, the Ferguson protests are not just about a death, but about the day-to-day life of people of color who share a growing resentment for perceived police harassment.How can police and communities track this tension before it boils over into riots and civil unrest? How can we measure the cost/benefit of certain types of stop and frisk practices, with metrics including community sentiment as well as community safety?Interestingly, new crime mapping and predictive technologies ordinarily used to prevent crime can be adapted to identify patterns of problematic police-citizen interaction. While the technologies are only just being made available to better-funded police departments, this ""stop and track"" solution does offer an additional remedy for those searching for an answer to prevent the next Ferguson situation.In jurisdictions like New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, police are employing sophisticated crime mapping technologies to map crime. Police track each reported crime, call for service, and arrest in terms of date, time, and event. In cities required to keep track of each police-citizen encounter, the data is even more granular. In New York City, for example, we know exactly where each stop took place because a UF-250 police form is filled out, uploaded into a computer and then mapped. This crime mapping technology has proved quite effective in reducing crime rates in certain neighborhoods, shifting scarce police resources to areas of higher crime, and organizing the rather chaotic reality of urban street policing. Yet, because it is police technology, it necessarily focuses on crime (it is ""crime mapping"" after all), and not the conduct of police officers in relation to the crime. So, we know a burglary happened on a particular block, but not necessarily where the police were patrolling when they failed to prevent that burglary. Obviously, to stop the next burglary, understanding why that ""missed opportunity"" occurred would be important. Or, we know that a police officer encountered a suspect and did not arrest him, but not the qualitative nature of the encounter. Essentially, the crime mapping software used in areas like New York City only tells us half the equation -- we know where the crime is and where police interact with citizens, but we do not know where the police were located when crime occurred or the nature of their interactions with citizens. Simply put, we are missing half of the picture that might provide a warning sign of increasing tension between the community and the police or even about individual police officers.Community distrust of police grows from two contradictory, but interlocking sources. First, certain communities are subject to more crime due to inadequate police intervention. Second, in an attempt to aggressively respond to crime, innocent people in those communities may be stopped and questioned without any accountability for the police error. As can be seen in the outpouring of stories after Ferguson, certain communities, thus, feel that the police are not on their side, and only out to harass them.If crime mapping technologies were redirected to also capture information about the conduct of the police important insights might emerge. First, understanding where police officers are in relation to the location of crime should improve police efficiency. Most police cars are (or soon will be) fitted with GPS technology. Some departments have begun adding RFID chips to police badges to map police officer movement throughout the day. These innovations, while obviously invasive to the police officer's personal freedom, would allow police administrators to map police patterns throughout the day. Overlaying the crime reports, police administrators would be able to more effectively utilize their officers to respond in real time to crime patterns.More importantly, once this granular level of police officer mapping was established, it would be possible to track individual officers on patrol and observe patterns of citizen involvement. A police officer who made fifty civilian stops a day with no recovered contraband, might be flagged as an officer who was stopping people without the requisite reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Studying individual police districts might allow for systemic comparisons about the appropriate level of police citizen encounters compared to other districts. Arrest efficiency metrics could be studied. Officers who had fewer stops, but more recovered contraband could be studied to see what made them more effective. Officers who simply appeared to be stopping everyone on the street could be re-trained. While having a better understanding of officers' conduct would not end all arbitrary stops on the street, it would provide an additional measure of accountability not currently in practice.Finally, in addition to the quantitative study of stops per successful recovery, crime mapping technologies and the reporting requirements could also include a qualitative measure of community sentiment. If police officers were required to report the citizen's reaction to the police stop, you would also have a measure of community sentiment. The underlying assumption of the Supreme Court's logic allowing police to approach and question all citizens for any reason without violating the Constitution is that police are generally acting in the best interests of the community. The underlying assumption of allowing Fourth Amendment stops based on a lesser standard of reasonable suspicion, is that police should be encouraged to investigate possible crimes, even if they do not have the higher level of probable cause. Both assume that the police are acting in good faith and that the community supports this pro-active intervention. But, tracking, measuring, and evaluating those assumptions are not regularly done. If police were required to inquire about the citizen's reaction to being stopped (erroneously) or questioned (innocently), police administrators would be able to gain a better sense of the tensions in the community. Hotspots of community anger could be mapped. In those jurisdictions that already require a report for every contact, all that would be required is an additional comment about the interaction. To keep police officers honest about the interaction, random audits of people stopped could be done to compare the reported sentiment to the actual sentiment. While devastating for the people involved, an incident like the shooting in Ferguson might not have created the same local outrage, if it had been an isolated event. Knowing about the pattern of community tension, could allow police administrators to address community sentiment with more targeted and sensitive interventions. If at the end of the day, a crime map could be created that mapped crime, police patrols, police-citizen encounters, and citizen sentiment, police administrators and civic leaders would have a much better accounting of possible trouble areas in the city. While it would not prevent individual tragedies from occurring, and it cannot solve the very difficult challenges faced by police officers involved in dangerous situations every day, it would provide an ability to study the problem in a new and innovative way."
4,MEDIA,Why What Happened To Reporters In Ferguson Matters So Much,Jack Mirkinson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reporters-ferguson-press-freedom_n_5685767.html,,2014-08-17,"Police advance through smoke Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5bee22600002d0182c575.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Wednesday, HuffPost Media tweeted the following about the scandalous treatment of reporters in Ferguson, MO:In response, many people asked us why we only seemed to get outraged when journalists were targeted in Ferguson.""What about the protestors?"" one person asked. ""Sorry for those reporters, but it's SHAMEFUL they shot an innocent kid first,"" another said.These types of questions come up every time we focus on what's happening to journalists in any given situation (which happens to be HuffPost Media's particular job, but still). Why, people ask, should we pay any special attention to people who are typically much more protected than the people they cover?The first thing to say is that anyone who only gets angry when something happens to journalists is very wrong. The situation in Ferguson was outrageous long before it started affecting members of the media. But there are a few very good reasons (and this is about to get a bit preachy, so bear with me) that we always need to highlight what happens to the press.One is that journalists are a powerful barometer for the health of a democracy. A free press is supposed to be a key part of any free society, and it is supposed to be protected. You can tell a lot about a place by how it treats its journalists. The past few years in the United States have seen a marked increase in the threats to the civil liberties of reporters—from surveillance to harassment to prosecution—merely for, as President Obama has ironically put it, ""doing their job."" It makes sense to pay attention to this trend. If something is happening to journalists—who tend to have larger megaphones and more civic power than your average citizen—then it's very likely to be happening to everyone else.So it was that what happened to journalists in Ferguson—the violence and the teargas and the arrests—became an acute symbol of the shabby regard that the police there seemed to have for peoples' First Amendment rights.The second reason is that attacks on the press are attacks on all of us. They are a particular outrage not because journalists are so important but because journalism itself is so important. In some ways, the most chilling thing that happened to the media in Ferguson was the order by police for local news crews to leave the area. It was that old cliché about journalism shining light on the dark places come disturbingly to life. The police were literally trying to turn the lights out.When people try to kick you out of a place, they are trying to make sure you don't come back. If they do that to journalists, they are trying to decrease the flow of information that the journalists can provide the rest of us. They are trying to keep all of us in the dark. So we need to do what we can to ensure that doesn't happen — and that means raising as much hell as we can when journalists, whether of the professional or the citizen variety, are attacked.The third reason—and this is admittedly the trickiest one—is that journalists make other journalists care about what's going on. There's no question that a lot of mainstream reporters only started fully paying attention to Ferguson when HuffPost's Ryan Reilly and the Washington Post's Wesley Lowery were hauled out of a local McDonald's. As Politico put it, ""An important story — involving the shooting of an unarmed African-American man by a police officer, public anger over the lack of details from the police and a heavily armed response to protests — had become something that hit home to journalists.""It is depressing that so many members of the media seem to only be moved to action when one of ""their own"" is affected. But such self-absorption can have its uses. Journalists play a huge role in shaping the way that stories are told. When they see things like what happened in Ferguson, they often start paying a lot more attention to the bigger picture. Many elite journalists were clearly shocked by what they were witnessing, and they were compelled to speak up. For evidence, we can look at the Twitter feed of Andrea Mitchell, as mainstream a journalist as they come. Before Reilly and Lowery were arrested, Ferguson played a minor role in her posts. But the second the news of the arrests broke, her feed's tone changed sharply. All of a sudden she was tweeting links to the livestreams of the turmoil in Missouri, and condemning the teargassing of Ferguson residents, and retweeting criticism of the police.It's hard to imagine her tweeting something as provocative as this if Lowery hadn't been arrested:Mitchell has 233,000 Twitter followers and a national news show that airs every day. You can bet that she was asking tougher questions after what happened to her fellow members of the media.Of course, the danger is that the stories about journalists overwhelm the stories about everybody else. That shouldn't happen. The most important story in Ferguson is not located in that McDonald's. It's located on the streets of the town, and with Michael Brown's family. But we should always keep an eye on what is happening to journalists, because that matters too. A lot."

I'm just going to guess you'd be a bit irritated.",2014-08-17,2014-08-17-10482826_10152701241206414_1244372217075229714_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-17-10482826_10152701241206414_1244372217075229714_n-thumb.jpg,"Disturbing. Beautiful. Compelling. Provocative. I wanted it to be over -- and I didn't want it to end.That's my succinct review of L Word Mississippi: Hate the Sin, Showtime's documentary that explores the lives of gay women in the Deep South. I watched it with Michelle, the woman I love, in our home of nearly a year in North Carolina -- a state that voted in 2012 for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as being between one man and one woman.Likely our state's ban on same-sex marriage will go the way of Virginia, where late last month a federal appeals court (the same one that has jurisdiction over North Carolina) struck down Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage.While I haven't seen North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper waving a rainbow flag after the Virginia ruling, he did hoist a white one. Cooper said he would no longer defend North Carolina's ban. His reason: The 4th Circuit was clear in its ruling. ""There are really no arguments left to be made,"" said Cooper, who also happens to be a Sunday school teacher and elder and deacon in his church.And Cooper's right: There aren't any arguments left. People should be allowed to marry the people they love. Period.One night while watching TV, Michelle pressed pause on the remote. This woman, who rarely struggles with words, was struggling with words. Finally she found them: ""Will you marry me?"" I -- the person twice married to men who vowed to never, ever, ever get married again -- said, ""yes.""That was months ago and we aren't a single step closer to getting married. Why? Because we're hung up on the ""where.""We're not looking to have an elaborate wedding. Likely we'll show up, just the two of us, at a courthouse and get married in front of a justice of the peace. But up until this point, for us to do even this very stripped-down version of marriage required driving some 300 miles to Washington, DC. Yes, soon we'll be able to scoot across the border to Virginia to get hitched, but the truth is, neither of these options are very appealing. While Virginia is a beautiful state, and Washington, DC, is our nation's capital, neither place means anything to either of us, personally.Imagine, my dear heterosexual friends, if this were you. I'm just going to guess you'd be a bit irritated.But God hates my girlfriend and me because we love each other, right? Oh wait, God doesn't hate me -- the sinner -- God hates my sin. If that's true (and I don't believe it is) then don't allow me to get married in your church. But don't restrict me from having the same legal rights that you do.After watching Showtime's L Word Mississippi, I went to bed disturbed. The hate these women have endured -- from themselves and from others -- was heartbreaking. Michelle, who isn't a crier, cried. Having been openly gay for some 20 years, she's experienced some of what these women have experienced, though she experienced it some 600 miles north in her native New York City.While I empathize with these women, I've never faced hate from people I love -- or strangers -- because of whom I love. That's because, for the majority of my 51 years, I've been in love with men. Being on society's fringe is new to me. So is being in a state where Christianity is so prevalent that store clerks regularly wish me a ""blessed"" day instead of just a ""nice"" one.For most of my life, I lived in my native Iowa, the fourth state in the U.S. to recognize same-sex marriage, which it's done since 2009. And while I was raised Catholic, Unity has been my spiritual home for the past 16 years because Unity's philosophy aligns with my own: God is love. No ""if,"" or ""but"" comes after that.I'm clear that my God doesn't hate me because I love a woman.I bet yours doesn't either.This blog was originally posted at anniescholl.com. "
11,POLITICS,Curfew In Effect For Second Night In Ferguson As Protests Continue,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ferguson-curfew_n_5686340.html,,2014-08-17,"A law enforcement officer watches Sunday, Aug. 17, 2014, as tear gas is fired to disperse a crowd protesting the shooting of teenager Michael Brown last Saturday in Ferguson, Mo. Brown's shooting in the middle of a street following a suspected robbery of a box of cigars from a nearby market has sparked a week of protests, riots and looting in the St. Louis suburb. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d2ed1f000025012573df.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FERGUSON, Mo. -- The Missouri Highway Patrol announced Sunday afternoon that a curfew would be in place again from midnight until 5 a.m. Monday, as protests continue over the police killing of unarmed black teen Michael Brown in this St. Louis suburb.The first curfew was announced Saturday by Gov. Jay Nixon (D), who said it was an attempt to curb looting that has accompanied the demonstrations. That curfew ran from midnight until 5 a.m. Sunday, but a few protesters defied it. One person was shot and seven were arrested during demonstrations in the early hours of Sunday morning.Officers used tear gas on crowds who were out past the first curfew, despite a Saturday statement from Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson that the tactic would not be used to enforce the midnight deadline to leave the streets. Johnson said Sunday that police had to use the tear gas to try to reach the wounded individual, but other protesters had already taken him to the hospital.Hundreds of people showed up at the Greater Grace Church just outside of Ferguson Sunday afternoon for a rally in Brown's memory. Speakers included Johnson, the Rev. Al Sharpton and civil rights activist Martin Luther King, III. So many people attended the event that it was virtually impossible to find parking, and an overflow crowd gathered outside.President Barack Obama and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder received loud cheers at the rally when their names were mentioned in connection with efforts to step in and ensure an independent investigation into Brown's death. The Justice Department has said it will conduct its own autopsy of Brown's body in order to assure objectivity. Many residents of Ferguson are calling for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch to step aside from leading the investigation into Brown's death in light of questions about his impartiality based on his past record of prosecutions and his recent comments in support of the St. Louis County Police Department, which used heavy-handed tactics in confronting protesters.Crowds also continued to gather on Sunday afternoon at the QT, the gas station and convenience store that was set on fire last week during demonstrations following Brown's death and has become a gathering place for community members to protest. Cars drove by and honked in support:A group of Tibetan monks even showed up to stand with the protesters: CORRECTION: Nixon was originally misidentified as a Republican. The governor is a Democrat."

But even generations of positive press about the continent would be hard pressed to erase the world's image of Africa as a hopeless place of death and terrorism. Consider this my small contribution to flipping that image.August 19th is World Humanitarian Day; marking the day in 2003 when 22 aid workers paid the ultimate price in the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad. It is intended to celebrate the spirit that inspires humanitarian work around the world, and Africa is a place where so much of this good work is happening.Across the African continent more than 1 million Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) -- from the grassroots level to multi-nationals -- are hard at work where local governments are unable or unwilling to provide social welfare services like healthcare, feeding programs and education to over half a billion people.  Mission statements for each organization vary widely, but the guiding principle of each is the same: they exist to improve the lives of their beneficiaries. The number of NGOs seems countless, but the tremendous scope and complexity of Africa's problems is overwhelming their resources. This is causing many NGOs to partner together to address some of Africa's biggest problems -- education, health, and employment -- in a multi-sector approach.Kenya Education Fund (KEF), an NGO I founded in 2006, is an example of an organization that has benefited from multiple partnerships. Our mission statement -- to provide disadvantaged students in Kenya with support and educational resources so that they may improve their communities and break the cycle of poverty in Kenya -- gives us little wiggle room to use donated funds on anything but education.   KEF staff visiting a potential KEF scholar in her Kibera home, photo credit KEF.We give out over 700 scholarships to high school students within Kenya. Since high school education is not free, our work gives students highly valued educational opportunities, but we know they need more than school fees. To succeed both academically and beyond the classroom our students also require life skills, psychosocial support, health care, nutrition and so much more than we can provide on our own. Simply put, linking up with other NGOs improves our own product. Partnerships work best when they are strategic and give us the wiggle room we need to offer our beneficiaries essential services that may lie outside the parameters of our mission statements. To that end, the KEF chooses to partner with organizations that can supplement our high school scholarships with other vital human services. Take the example of Lwala Community Alliance, an NGO with incredible results in reducing infant mortality and maternal deaths in Western Kenya. When we realized that KEF scholars were not receiving reproductive health information in their schools, Lwala agreed to teach it to our kids, potentially saving hundreds of girls from unwanted teenage pregnancy. In return, KEF provides dozens of Lwala beneficiaries with high school scholarships to help round out their health services with the provision of education.We also partner with organizations that can help our students in the next step of life after high school graduation. Africa Nazarene University provides life skills and mentoring to our scholars and Zawadi Africa Education Fund sends KEF high school graduates to US colleges like Lafayette in Pennsylvania and Lakeland in Michigan, to name a couple. These strategic partnerships give our students opportunities for a brighter future and ensure that our work has a lasting impact beyond providing school fees.  Africa Nazarene University mentors leading team building exercises at a KEF mentoring workshop, photo credit KEF.The nice thing about these partnerships is that there doesn't necessarily need to be a quid pro quo because the work is driven by a shared commitment to humanitarian values and a shared understanding that a single organization does not have the capacity to holistically serve the many needs of our beneficiaries.There is no doubt that our partnerships have made the KEF a better NGO.Not all NGOs are fond of the idea of partnerships. This is understandable due to the ever-increasing competitiveness of a shrinking pool of grant funds, but it leads to wasteful duplication and poor-quality services. The result is large-scale multi-national organizations trying to provide too many services on their own, many of which are outside their area of expertise. These Wal-Mart-sized NGOs often crowd out local efforts to address local problems, hurting the ultimate mission of providing people with tools to better their lives.  KEF scholars visiting our partner Kenya Medical Training College as part of a mentoring program with Johnson & Johnson and FHI 360, photo credit KEF Facebook page.My experience tells me that when responsible NGOs work together, often across sectors, we gain efficiencies of scale in the delivery of highly-specialized services. In the end, larger swaths of the population are touched by not just one, but an array of these life-improving inputs and we begin to see our combined efforts improve lives in meaningful and lasting ways.

We've been talking to them. For the past two years, our crew has traveled around in a 1978 RV, interviewing hundreds of millennials about what it's like to find a sense of identity and direction post-Recession. So much information out there is negatively spun about our situation. We've found millennials are using that muck to transform social norms and redefine success. There are as many ways to navigate your 20s as there are 20-somethings. Here is what the next crop of human potential has working in its favor:1. We know we can change the world. 85 percent  of millennials want to work somewhere improving society. We crave meaning over money. 58 percent  of students say they would take a pay cut to work at an organization they feel ethically aligned with. We don't want to live in cognitive dissonance by doing anything else. 2. There are an estimated 2.5 billion of us across the globe. That's more people than all active military members in every country combined. This is our millennial army, and we are not satisfied with the state of the world. 3. Entrepreneurism is our religion. 70 percent of millennials want to start their own business. We've been bashed for job hopping, when really, most of us are studying our employers. We have a plan. We see entrepreneurship as the best way to create opportunities for ourselves and others, share our gifts, solve international problems, and finally achieve a sense of autonomy and conscientious interdependence. 4. We're all about growth. 77 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds agree emerging adulthood is the time to figure out who you are and what you want to do. We prioritize personal development. That's why we travel across the world to stick ourselves in situations foreign, absurd, and sometimes reckless. Experimenting with partners, professions, and lifestyles is how we discover our likes and dislikes, the parts of ourselves that persist in any environment, and the aspects of tradition that truly feel authentic.5. We create our own rite of passage. The line between being an adolescent and being an adult has never been so blurred. Biologically, we're adults, but not based on past social indicators like finishing education, buying a home, getting married, and having children. Gen Yers initiate themselves into adulthood by being bold enough to pick a path and take responsibility for the consequences, regardless of what others think about the decision. 6. We hate/love our options. Millennials have a global playing field to compete and find our niches within. Young women are closing the income gap with men. There are thousands of options for our future, which can be viewed as a sign of progress and privilege - but it also makes us want to vomit. Millennials can do almost anything (except, perhaps, affect political policies). But we slowly learn we can't do everything. It takes a while, but once we move past analysis paralysis, get over the crises of confidence, and channel our dreams down to one (or two), we are willing to exhaust ourselves in any effort to succeed. 7. Our best assets are qualitative. Millennials are leading the wave of Americans who think the American Dream is dead. We have adapted to our economic circumstances by basing our self-esteem on less tangible aspects of life that can't always be monetized like creative expression, the strength of our social networks and friendships, our ability to constantly change and stay optimistic. 8. We are open to living alternatively (and we own it). The search for utopia lives on with the modern youth. Off-the-grid homesteads and eco-friendly permaculture communities are being championed by millennials who can't make ends meet within the system and crave to live more sustainably without exhausting their ardor fighting bureaucracy. Our desire to feel support from others and tread lightly on nature has us banding together to see if we can create hyper localized societies together. 9. Our entitlement speaks to our ambition. When a recent college grad acts like they deserve to be CEO in their first week on a job, and you find yourself wanting to kill them, remember this. Millennials may lack experience hacking away in the trenches of the working world, paying dues like you did. We may abandon prudence in our attempts to seize opportunities in an environment where they seem scarce, but it's because we're hungry. Sharing ideas, being heard, feeling like we have a purpose, and getting rewarded with a living wage for our contributions are signs of self-respect and worker rights we believe we deserve. Millennials are resilient. We embody a joie de vive and live according to a moral compass, despite all our trials and all our errors and all of our uncertainty. Photography by Ali Kaukas"

General Mills, the maker of Cheerios cereal and Pillsbury baking products, plans to report full third-quarter results March 19. Photographer: Ariana Lindquist/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb311dd200000e800001ccd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From 24/7 Wall St.: The agriculture and food production industry employed more than one billion people as of last year, or a third of the global workforce. While the industry is substantial, a relatively small number of companies wield an enormous amount of influence.In its 2013 report, “Behind the Brands,” Oxfam International focused on 10 of the world’s biggest and most influential food and beverage companies. These corporations are so powerful that their policies can have a major impact on the diets and working conditions of people worldwide, as well as on the environment. Based on the report, these are the 10 companies that control the world’s food.Click here to see the companies that control the world’s food.In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Chris Jochnick, director of the private sector department at Oxfam America, discussed the impact that these 10 companies have on the world. “If you look at the massive global food system, it’s hard to get your head around. Just a handful of companies can dictate food choices, supplier terms and consumer variety,” Jochnick said.These 10 companies are among the largest in the world by a number of measures. All of them had revenues in the tens of billions of dollars in 2013. Five of these companies had at least $50 billion in assets, while four had more than $6 billion in profits last year. Additionally, these 10 companies directly employed more than 1.5 million people combined — and contracted with far more.Nestle is the largest of these 10 companies. Converted into dollars, Nestle had more than $100 billion in sales and more than $11 billion in profits in 2013. The Switzerland food giant alone employed roughly 333,000 people.Many of these companies and their brands are extremely well known. One reason is that they often spend huge sums on advertising. Nine of these 10 companies were among the 100 largest media spenders in the world in 2012. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), the world’s sixth largest advertiser, spent more than $3 billion in 2012 on advertising. Unilever’s media expenditure, at $7.4 billion, was the second-highest worldwide.With such scale, many of these companies’ policies — including advertising, food ingredients, environmental impact, and labor practices — have an significant impact on millions of lives. Often, these companies have been reluctant to address issues related to their environmental impact and the quality of life of workers in their supply chain. According to Jochnick, many of these companies are “unaware of the social and environmental impact that they are creating or facilitating.”However, not all the companies are reluctant to address these problems. None of the 10 companies was better-rated by Oxfam than Nestle, which was closely followed by Unilever. Still, even these companies had problems, according to Oxfam’s 2013 report. In 2011, Nestle discovered cases of children working in its cocoa supply chain, as well as instances of forced labor. A supplier of palm oil for Unilever was accused of illegal deforestation and forcible land grabs.A strong public profile, as well as consumer awareness, may lead these companies to address issues of concern. “A company that is good and trusted ought to be a company that is aware of, and taking steps to avoid, serious human rights or social or environmental problems that it is part of,” Jochnick said.Some companies have taken steps towards becoming better corporate citizens. General Mills and Kellogg, which have been among the 10 companies Oxfam studied, have implemented new policies to address important issues such as climate change. Both companies recently committed to disclosing and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years.Based on Oxfam International’s 2013 report, “Behind the Brands: Food justice and the ‘Big 10’ food and beverage companies,” 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 companies that control the world’s food.

He did not specify where the vehicles would come from.Moscow has come under heavy Western sanctions over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea and accusations it is supporting separatists in east Ukraine with fighters, arms and funds. Russia denies those charges.In a sign of concern at the latest rebel comments, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko agreed in a phone call on Saturday that deliveries of weapons to separatists in Ukraine must stop and a ceasefire must be achieved, a German government spokesman said.The risk of outright war between the two most powerful former Soviet states was highlighted on Friday when Ukraine said it partially destroyed an armored column that had crossed the border from Russia. The report triggered a sell-off in global shares.But Moscow made no threat of retaliation, instead saying it was a ""fantasy"" that its armored vehicles had entered its neighbor's territory.U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also spoke to Poroshenko on Saturday, and the White House said: ""The two leaders agreed that Russia's sending military columns across the border into Ukraine and its continued provision of advanced weapons to the separatists was inconsistent with any desire to improve the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine.""Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin called on NATO to provide military support for Ukrainian troops.The rebels, who have ceded ground to government forces in recent weeks, have been promising a counter-offensive for several days but have yet to launch one.Ukrainian native Zakharchenko took over from Russian citizen Alexander Borodai last week and his combative comments will probably dash hopes that changes at the top of the rebel leadership might signal willingness to end hostilities. CONVOY WAITSAdding to the tensions, Russia and Ukraine have been at loggerheads for days over a convoy of 280 Russian trucks carrying water, food and medicine, which remained about 20 km (12 miles) from the Ukrainian border, unmoved since Friday.Officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross said most procedures had been agreed by Russia and Ukraine but the two sides still needed to figure out how to provide security before the convoy moves ahead under the ICRC's aegis. It was not clear when a deal on security could be agreed.Russia says it is a purely humanitarian mission in support of civilians in areas hit by the conflict, but Ukraine is concerned it could serve as a Trojan Horse to infiltrate military supplies or create a pretext for armed intervention.The crisis has dragged relations between Russia and the West to their lowest point since the Cold War and set off a round of trade restrictions that are hurting struggling economies in both Russia and Europe. The United Nations said this week that an estimated 2,086 people had been killed, with nearly 5,000 wounded.The Finnish President, Sauli Niinisto, held talks in Kiev with Poroshenko, a day after discussing how to settle the crisis with Russian President Vladimir Putin.""I do not see a great risk of an outright war,"" Niinisto said. ""My hopefulness is based on the fact that communication is open, at least by a crack.""France said a meeting of Ukrainian, Russian, German and French foreign ministers scheduled in Berlin on Sunday could be a first step towards a peace summit.A rebel Internet news outlet said on Saturday that separatist fighters had killed 30 members of a Ukrainian government battalion in fighting in Luhansk province, a rebel-held area of eastern Ukraine adjacent to the Russian border.A Ukrainian military spokesman, Andriy Lysenko, contradicted the rebel assertions. He said three Ukrainian servicemen had been killed over the past 24 hours. Ukrainian security forces had spotted Russian drones and a helicopter crossing illegally into Ukraine's airspace, Lysenko told a news briefing.He denied Kiev's forces were firing artillery on Donetsk, one of two rebel strongholds in the east, where a Reuters reporter said explosions were audible in the city center on Saturday. The Donetsk city administration said four people were killed in shelling that destroyed homes and set several buildings on fire.MOMENTUM WITH THE ARMYThe momentum on the ground is with the Ukrainian forces, who have pushed the separatists out of large swathes of territory and nearly encircled them in Donetsk and Luhansk. Kiev says it now controls the road linking the two cities.Russia says the Ukrainian offensive is causing a humanitarian catastrophe for the civilian population in the two cities. It accuses Kiev's forces of indiscriminately using heavy weapons in residential areas, an allegation Ukraine denies.In the past week, three senior rebel leaders have been removed from their posts, pointing to mounting disagreement over how to turn the tide of the fighting back in their favor.Lysenko, the Ukrainian military spokesman, said he had reports of rebel fighters abandoning their posts in Luhansk, and preparing to leave Donetsk and seek safe haven in Russia.""A mood of panic is spreading and rebels are trying to leave through the small gaps that remain,"" he said.In Donetsk, the red, blue and black flag of separatists was flying on a pole in front of the headquarters. Ten people armed with Kalashnikov rifles were standing on guard outside the main entrance in mismatched camouflage.""Why should we flee? People are still coming and filling our ranks. Those who have lost their houses to Ukrainian shelling, what else would they do but fight back?,"" said a fighter who gave his name as Communist.

(RNS) The nation’s largest leadership group for Catholic nuns will bestow its top award Friday (Aug. 15) on a theologian who has been condemned by the U.S. Catholic bishops for her book examining the nature of God.In addition, a top Vatican official warned the Leadership Conference of Women Religious in April that honoring Sister Elizabeth Johnson, author of “Quest for the Living God” and longtime Fordham University professor, would be considered provoking the Holy See and U.S. bishops.Meeting for their annual four-day conference in Nashville this week, the group’s leaders are publicly discussing spirituality and doctrine while taking up church politics in closed sessions. Their appointed overseer, Seattle Archbishop J. Peter Sartain, said he’s promised the sisters not to talk about their conflict with the media, and the LCWR’s spokeswoman said interviews with nuns were contingent on agreements not to mention it.The LCWR represents 80 percent of the 51,600 women religious in the United States. The organization has been under fire since 2012, when the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Catholic church’s top orthodoxy enforcement group, ordered the nuns to revise their statutes and move away from “radical feminism.”After this conference, Sartain will approve all speakers.Despite the public display of unity, signs of the dispute emerged.The nuns launched their assembly with interpretive dance and happy songs about justice. But after Vatican-based Rev. Hank Lemoncelli took the stage to read a letter that included hard questions about whether the orders were following the rules of Jesus, reporters rushed to ask if those were related to attempts to bring the nuns into line.Lemoncelli insisted the letter’s questions were the same as those read to priests.Sister Nancy Schreck, a former LCWR president who delivered the keynote address, said anyone who knows the Vatican II document about religious life shouldn’t find the questions unusual.At the same time, she quietly reiterated Johnson’s book’s stance that there’s more than one way to look at God and said that while the church is a vehicle for mission, the LCWR’s focus is the life of Jesus.“Look at the four Gospels — they all have nuances in who Jesus is,” she said. “We need to figure out how we translate the message of Jesus to the world where we live. We will be richer for looking at a variety of interpretations.”The group’s new president, who took leadership today avoided discussing the conflict but scoffed at a newspaper headline in her native Michigan titled: “Sister Soldier.” It topped an article about Sister Sharon Holland’s ascension to leadership in LCWR after 21 years of experience as a Vatican-based legal expert in church law.“They must not know how we feel about military conflict,” she joked.It’s unlikely the sides can come to a solution, said Bruce Morrill, a Vanderbilt University professor of theological studies and a Jesuit priest.At the conflict’s heart is a difference in approach to hierarchical chain of command: the top-down, morals-emphasizing Vatican versus the collegial, social-justice oriented nuns.“As far as the U.S. bishops and Vatican officials are concerned, this is not a debate,” Morrill said. “The hierarchy expects the women religious to obey their directives, such as their having now to submit the agendas and speakers for future annual meetings to the archbishop.”"

Thousands of people, mostly women, children and elderly, search for shelter in the Zam Zam refugee camp following an armed militia attack on their villages.

The displaced community continues to request for basic services such as water, food, healthcare services and shelter for refugees.

Tens of thousands of civilians, mainly women and children, were terrorized during this ferocious operation; a great many were beaten, humiliated, and robbed. Dozens were arrested, only to be released when no evidence could be adduced to justify the arrests. Lack of evidence, however, is not always sufficient to guarantee release, and a number of those arrested remain in custody and subject to torture.The force that assaulted El Salam camp was large in number -- they came in a reported 140 vehicles -- and heavily armed. Photographs that have come to me from a confidential source at the location bear out what had been earlier reported by Radio Dabanga, virtually our only news source about violence in Darfur, once the a cause célèbre among American and European civil society. If not for the Radio Dabanga dispatch, El Salam would have been another in a long list of assaults on unarmed civilians in camps for displaced persons -- displaced by the very militia and military elements that are now attacking them.The UN/African Union ""hybrid"" mission in Darfur (UNAMID) was nowhere to be seen on the occasion of the attack on El Salam, despite the fact that the camp is only a few miles from Nyala, capital of South Darfur and the largest town in all of Darfur. For despite its large size and cost, UNAMID is rarely able to protect civilians, either in camps, towns, or rural areas, even though civilian protection is the primary mandate of the mission. It is hardly surprising that such deficiencies are only very rarely reported by UNAMID itself, since it is routinely denied access to the scenes of atrocity crimes. We learn of the failures of this vast and immensely expensive mission only from Darfuris themselves, and chiefly by means of Radio Dabanga. The Khartoum regime permits no human rights or news reporting presence in Darfur, and the UN and international nongovernmental humanitarian organizations operating there live in constant, all too well justified fear of expulsion; they are silent about what they see.In turn, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- in his mandated quarterly reports on Darfur and UNMAID -- relies on the UN/AU mission itself for reports about sexual violence, murders, assaults, land appropriation, extortion sites on major highways, robbery, kidnapping, and wholesale military and militia assaults on towns. But very little of what occurs is actually reported by UNAMID, both because of access limitations as well as lack of land and air transport capacity, and a relationship with Khartoum that has become increasingly cozy over the years. This is partly a response to Khartoum's primary responsibility for the killing, by means of its Arab militia forces, more than 50 UN peacekeepers during the time of deployment.Throughout its six-year history, UNAMID has been badly led by the likes of Rodolphe Adada (Congo) and the wholly incompetent Ibrahim Gambari (Nigeria). It has been hampered by a lack of trained personnel (a great many units operate significantly below minimum UN peacekeeping standards), and a lack of required equipment, especially helicopters; here militarily capable Western nations have been unforgivably stingy, compromising a mission they nominally supported but refused to supply when there were key shortages. Morale is disastrously low within UNAMID, and recent investigative reporting makes clear that reports on Darfur are too often exercises in expediency and mendacity.The mission as it stands has failed in its primary purpose, and that failure has been growing steadily for more than two years. And yet there are no voices calling for a response to this failure: not the UN, where the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations simply wants to get rid of this embarrassing and resource-consuming failure; not the AU, many members states of which benefit financially from UN stipends and payments (which are often generous by country states), or the U.S. Indeed, the Obama administration several years ago ""de-coupled"" Darfur from the primary issues in its Sudan policy, and has had almost nothing to say about what was once characterized by candidate and President Obama's repeated characterizations of Darfur as the site of genocide. In 2007, invoking Rwanda and Bosnia as justification for humanitarian intervention in Darfur, Obama declared:The United States has a moral obligation anytime you see humanitarian catastrophes... When you see a genocide in Rwanda, Bosnia or in Darfur, that is a stain on all of us, a stain on our souls .... We can't say ""never again"" and then allow it to happen again, and as a president of the United States I don't intend to abandon people or turn a blind eye to slaughter. Sadly, ""turning a blind eye"" to Darfur is now a central feature of the administration's bilateral relationship with the genocidal regime in Khartoum.To be sure, the Arab League has been useless for the entire course of the Darfur catastrophe; and Russia and China -- primary weapons suppliers to Khartoum (and thus to the regime's regular and militia forces in Darfur) -- have been relentless obstructionists within the UN Security Council. The European Union has no coherent policy or plan to relieve the suffering or end assaults on displaced persons in Darfur. Two days after the attack on El Salam displaced persons camp, Dereig camp was similarly attacked. Radio Dabanga today reports that another displaced persons camp, in North Darfur near Shangil Tobaya, has been surrounded and assaulted; women were raped and at least one many was murdered. Displaced persons camps have been attacked since 2005, but there has been a clear and extremely dangerous increase in such attacks for more than two years; and as always been true, those responsible enjoy complete impunity.Despite the vague inertia of previous efforts to bring security to the region, despite the contrived and unworkable ""Doha Document for Peace in Darfur"" -- virtually unanimously rejected by Darfuri civil society and the consequential rebel groups -- Darfur has been abandoned by the international community. But attacks on unarmed and innocent civilians continue to be a daily reality, without any end in sight. Humanitarians may soon be compelled by growing insecurity to withdraw. It's difficult to escape the conclusion that Darfur is the genocide that people got tired of. A terrible epitaph in the wake of so many impassioned declarations of ""never again."""

It may be difficult to find time in a hectic schedule on Aug. 16, but it's easy to find focus for those who understand and appreciate rare concepts like selflessness, service, and sacrifice. Just look for wings surrounding a parachute somewhere on a uniform. Of course, it's appropriate to give thanks for our military people any day of any year, but National Airborne Day is a chance to drill down a bit and recognize those who get into the action in a very special way: by jumping out of perfectly good aircraft in pursuit of our nation's military missions around the world. These are soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who not only volunteered to go in harm's way but agreed to get there via one of the most inherently risky methods known to military science, involving things like parachutes, gliders, and helicopters. These are the folks who serve at the very pointiest end of the American military spear. The lethal edge of that spear was forged and honed back in the early 1940s, when military progressives -- unlike virtually everyone else in America -- understood that a second world war was inevitable, and that success in that ugly endeavor would require forces that could be inserted at points behind the enemy's forward defensive lines. What was needed, according to the soldiers who formed the U.S. Army's Test Parachute Platoon at Fort Benning, was an outfit that could be launched by air using parachutes -- and, later, gliders -- ahead of an allied assault to seize vital objectives or simply create chaos in the enemy's rear areas. And that concept, tested for practicality by just 48 volunteer soldiers, who made their first official jump on Aug. 16, 1940, led to a legacy of airborne soldiers as an outfit that has operated as a light, fast, and lethal assault element in some 93 combat jumps from the first one made by the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment, in North Africa during World War II to airborne landings in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, and the Middle East. Much has changed in the business of airborne combat since that time. There are those pundits who claim that the days of massive tactical jumps by airborne forces are over, and that putting soldiers at risk by parachute assault is much too risky given newer and more efficient means available today. But you'll never convince airborne troopers that they are passé, or that their willingness to leap into combat hanging vulnerable under canopy is a thing of the past. That's because there is and always will be something very special about a paratrooper that sets him or her apart from the ordinary foot soldier. That's easy to understand when you're thinking about Green Berets, SEALs, Force Recon Marines, or other operators who do a lot of parachuting and air landing due to the nature of their special-operations missions. The heart and soul of America's airborne forces resides today in the dwindling number of line outfits like the 82nd Airborne Division, 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the 75th Ranger Regiment, where you find men and women who regularly risk life and limb because they understand that the day will come when that green light at the jump door means their skill, motivation, and dedication will be needed to save the day.These are soldiers who deserve our admiration, respect, and support on National Airborne Day and every other day. These are the people who will lead our forces into any fight we choose to make in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world where national interests must be served by military action. They are special indeed, and that status involves more than just jumping out of airplanes, although that's risky enough to generate our respect. What counts with the airborne soldier is that he or she jumps ready to fight and knowing full well that they will likely be outnumbered on the ground and probably surrounded when they land -- assuming they survive the exit and descent required to get at the enemy. These are soldiers who understand, with great serenity, that their survival depends on catching the enemy by surprise, closing with him and killing him -- very likely at close quarters -- with only the food, support, and ammunition they can carry out the door when they jump. And they know they will have to continue this brutal mission until heavier ground forces arrive, or they die in combat. Recognizing that sort of dedication and selfless devotion to supporting our country's interests is worth contemplation. It takes one of our brave paratroopers just a few minutes to land after leaving the aircraft on the average military jump. We can afford at least that much time to appreciate the effort and the risk they take for us all. Capt. Dale A.
