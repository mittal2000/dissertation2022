A term was coined for those divas who have an impact on the gay community through entertainment and advocacy. Thus the ""gay icon"" was born. A gay icon is a celebrity or public figure who is embraced by the gay community. To reach gay icon status, one has to be able to relate to us through flamboyance, strength, triumph over adversity, glamor and even androgyny. Divas with powerhouse voices, gay anthems, over-the-top personalities and an unapologetic and unforgettable approach to fashion that would inspire envy in a drag queen are likely to become gay icons.Sorry, Sir Elton John, Freddie Mercury, George Michael and Adam Lambert, but with Women's History Month coming to a close soon, this blog post celebrates the female divas who hold bigger special places in our gay hearts than our very own fag hags. Below are 25 of the many divas who have left their marks on gay men and gay culture."
1,BUSINESS,Success From Understanding History,"Don McNay, Contributor

For all of his liberal positions on the environment, taxes and health care, Obama is a hawk when it comes to the war on terror. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2edea25000094003894fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was reading an obscure blog, ""The Impact of the Affordable Care Act on Special Needs Planning"" by Scott Solkoff, when I saw a line that jumped out.""There will be new opportunities for special needs attorneys because of the complexity of the Affordable Care Act."" That line made me realize the fundamental key to success:1. Change is always going to make things more complex. 2. Those who ""get"" the complexity will master the universe.I've owned a computer since the first IBM PC 30 years ago. I spent countless hours learning how to program code, manipulate software and rewire machines in order to do something simple like calculate simple numbers.On the other hand, my ability to quickly calculate numbers gave me a huge advantage over competitors, who still use pen and paper. Many of them did not make it. Apple became the largest company in the world by sticking to the mantra of making their products simple to understand. I don't need to do complicated programming to get an iPad to work; I just click on an application specifically designed to the task I want it to perform.If I wanted, I could still do programming on an IBM XT. Part of me thinks that I spent years on a skill that is no longer needed. The better part understands that the skill helped me get a competitive edge and fuel my desire to embrace change.Most people are afraid of change. They want affirmation from ""what everyone else is doing"" and don't want to spend the time and effort to keep on educating themselves. I've been as guilty of that as anyone. I realize that my stalling points in life are when I decided I ""knew everything"" and got lazy. As Harry Truman said, ""It's what you learn after you know it all that counts."" The first key to understanding Truman's point is to recognize that you are never going to ""know it all."" The second key is that if you aren't constantly trying to ""know it all,"" you are going to fall behind. I see the world with a great divide of have's and have not's. I don't see it as shaped by economics or ideology. The divide is between people who are hungry to learn and those who aren't. The hottest countries on the world stage, like China and India, are fueled by the excitement of people willing to seek knowledge and embrace change. A simple dynamic fueled their desire. Not long ago, they were two of the poorest countries in the world. They are seeing their quest for knowledge being rewarded with a better lifestyle for their families and themselves. It's a lot harder to embrace change when things are going pretty well. It's also hard when you don't see an immediate tangible result.That is where education comes in. One of my great frustrations of 21st century society is that the study of history is not cherished as it should be.There is a lot of focus on dealing with the problems of the moment instead of recognizing that someone else dealt with a similar problem decades or centuries ago. To use another Harry Truman quote, ""the only thing new is the history you don't know."" That is why I sat and read all 906 pages in the Affordable Care Act. Several times. I read every nuance through the same lens: Where are the opportunities for myself and my clients?I also viewed it through the lens of a historic event: The interstate highway system. Just like Obamacare will do, the interstate highway system dramatically changed America. Those who understood the opportunities prospered. Those who did not went out of business.Although there were some who made money building roads and bridges, the overwhelming opportunities of the interstate highway system were not on the surface.One on both sides was Colonel Harlan Sanders. He had a successful restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, right on a main road, until the interstate highway system routed cars in a different direction. Broke at age 65, Colonel Sanders did not curse his bad luck. He embraced change, such as the mobility of society spurred by the interstate highway system and the rise of fast foods like McDonalds. By teaming up with smart businessmen, like former Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown Jr., Sanders created one of the world's most successful brands in Kentucky Fried Chicken. There are immediate opportunities for my clients as Obamacare comes into law. What I am looking for is the less obvious opportunities, just like Colonel Sanders.As I learned from history, it's possible for an obscure Kentucky businessman to ride the waves of change to success. As long as we are willing to embrace change and not be afraid of it. Don McNay's fifth bestselling book is , Life Lessons from the Golf Course, co authored with PGA professional Clay Hamrick,  "
2,BUSINESS,Crafting the Cyprus Deal: A Road Filled With Blunders,"David Catalan, Contributor
Engineer, Activist, Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cyprus-deal_us_5bb2ed11e4b0480ca65eeaa1,"The role of the Troika in bailing out governments and banks is nothing new, but the solutions put forward by EU leaders to improve the Cypriot crisis seem to be founded on little foresight, and without regard for the tragic mistakes of the past few years.",2013-03-31,"People queue at an ATM outside a closed Laiki Bank branch in capital Nicosia, Cyprus, Thursday, March 21, 2013. The European Central Bank says it will keep emergency aid for Cyprus' troubled banks in place at least until Monday but will have to cut it off after that unless an international rescue program is drawn up. (AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2ed1120000030000012eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's almost like Brussels has a sort of policy amnesia. The role of the Troika in bailing out governments and banks is nothing new, but the solutions put forward by EU leaders to improve the Cypriot crisis seem to be founded on little foresight, and without regard for the tragic mistakes of the past few years.Last week's solutions, which thankfully never materialized, proposed a governmental foray into peoples' savings accounts. In theory this was a fine solution. Lest the country's troubled banks stop receiving assistance, the European Central Bank demanded Cyprus to pony up $7.5 billion, an amount equivalent to 30 percent of the country's GDP. The math made sense on paper, but in reality much of the money behind those figures came from everyday people. It didn't matter whether that money was saved for someone's retirement, schooling, mortgage, or car payment. If last week's policy came to life, all deposits would have been diluted by at least 7 percent.If the idea sounds ridiculous, frightening -- stultifying, even -- it's because raiding peoples' savings accounts is all of these. The late hours of Sunday night saw the eurozone leaders agreeing to a measure that leaves most deposits untouched, but it seems that they've now set a precedent: if a eurozone government needs extra dough, savings accounts are fair game.But what's even more shocking is that last week's policy wonks discussed these measures despite the existence of a eurozone decision in 2008 to insure bank depositors up to 100,000 euros. So at the crux of it, last week's policy suggestion spits in the face of such financial guarantees. It gives people one more reason to distrust their banks and hoard their money at home. And when money lies under the mattress instead of in the bank, the banks have nothing to dole out in the way of loans. And there we are with people who can't take out loans and therefore buy a house or improve their business. We've come full circle in worsening our recession. A recent opinion piece by Douglas Elliott, a seasoned investment banker, compares the behavior of the eurozone to that of an unfortunate soul playing Russian roulette. The currency union pulls the trigger by assembling some drastic measures at the last moment before economic doom. To everyone's delight, the bullet doesn't fire: whatever policy emerges happens to save the euro from collapse, and people blissfully move on. That is, until the next catastrophe when some housing bubble, or bank default, or government insolvency sounds the alarm. Then the eurozone can once again pull the trigger hoping that the bullet won't really be there. According to Elliott, it would have been so much easier to bail out the country's banks without too much fuss. That way they could have focused on reform and encourage what's really needed: growth.Take a moment to imagine that you're back in 2010. All of a sudden, draconian demands instituted by the ECB sound eerily familiar. During that year, Greece, which in many ways is Cyprus' closest cultural relative, entered contentious discussions with the Troika. In exchange for funds to keep the government afloat, Athens passed drastic austerity measures, ones that kept the balances in check, but ultimately placed the burden on ordinary people. The cutbacks shrank the economy, elevated the poverty rate, and eroded the quality of life. The social toll of the economic cutbacks contributed to the rise of an extremist neo-Nazi party that now claims seats in the Greek parliament. The painful austerity measures restricted any possibility that Greece could climb out of the sort of habits that led it into enormous debt in the first place.To be fair, Cyprus is in a much different place; this time the ECB is bailing out the banks rather than an entire government. But the lesson from Greece says that strict austerity without encouraging some modest growth is a recipe to prolong the European recession. I hardly see how last week's suggestion to raid peoples' bank deposits encourages the growth that Europe needs right now. Instead, it gives people reason to pull their money out of the banks, ultimately destabilizing the financial sector.As proof that it vanquishes faith in the banks, look at what happened to the stock market on Monday. Investors exalted when they saw that Europe surmounted the Cyprus problem. But not long after, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the leader of the finance ministers in Europe, put in his two bits: the recent Cyprus decision, he commented, is a model for any struggling eurozone economy. Taxpayers won't bail out the banks, but depositors and bondholders will. To say this so soon after the success of Sunday's eurozone deal was simply asinine and brazen. Mr. Dijsselbloem gutted what little faith people had left in the banks, sending the message that your money is safe nowhere. He softened his remarks later in the day, but it was too late. Newspapers in Athens and Madrid ran almost identical headlines that focused on the gravitas of the Cyprus decision and the precedent it lays for the future.* Investors cringed and stocks plunged on both sides of the Atlantic.Personally, I never expected Cyprus to flourish in the years immediately after the Greek crisis. For a variety of cultural and historical reasons, Cypriot banks heavily exposed themselves to the Greek economy. And when the latter fell apart, it was only a matter of time before the tempest moved farther into the eastern Mediterranean. It simply demonstrates that we can expect a handful of economic hurdles in the future, if only because what happens in one country affects what happens in others.As the Troika starts a new chapter after the recent acrimony in Cyprus, its leaders must seriously rethink the narrative they offer to the public. The importance of keeping state and bank budgets in check must carefully weigh against the need for economic growth and social stability. This most recent hurly-burly was unnecessarily tense, a climate that, according to Moody's, inflicted enough damage on Cyprus' large financial sector to be felt for years to come. Scaring people into a bank run is no way to encourage the sort of fiscal punctilio that the Germans want of the struggling southern Mediterranean countries. If they consider the misery of the Greek situation, they'll know not to turn that direction, and instead advocate simultaneously for growth and responsible spending.If I'm correct, the responsible thing to do with one's money is save it. In most places, having a savings implies that a person has discipline, stability, and resolve. But in the eurozone, apparently, putting a savings in the bank isn't smart. It shows stupidity.*My translation of the Greek and Spanish headlines are as follows: ""Cyprus Agreement a New Prototype for Europe, Says Dijsselbloem,"" and ""Eurogroup Leader Proposes the Cyprus Method For Other Countries"""

I raise my face to the sun, and movie fanatic that I am, I hear Groucho's voice ringing in my ears: ""Sing ho! For the open highway! Sing ho! For the open road!"" (Anyone remember the movie?)Now seems like just the right time to talk about road movies, that bounteous staple of film that almost warrants its own subgenre. It all stems from something basic in our human nature: the instinct to move, roam, and explore. Being evolved, reasoning creatures, our desire to travel only increases in more pleasant weather.Going all the way back to Homer's Odyssey, some of our finest stories take place on voyages or quests of some kind, where our hero (or heroine) not only experiences new sights and adventures, but also some transformation in thinking, circumstance, or attitude as a result.The road movie is the cinematic equivalent. Here then are my own 10 favorite road movie entries, which you can read more about (and rent) by clicking on the title(s). All these films have offered me particularly memorable and exciting travels from the comfort of my La-Z-Boy:It Happened One Night (1934) -- Down-on-his luck reporter (Clark Gable) gets scoop of a lifetime when he meets an heiress on the lam (Claudette Colbert) on a bus excursion. Then -- as usual -- romance complicates things. The first film to sweep the Oscars in all major categories.Sullivan's Travels (1941) -- Well-meaning hack Hollywood director (Joel McCrea) wants to make a serious, important picture for a chance, profiling the plight of the impoverished masses. He takes a trip to find them with just a dime in his pocket and gets much more than he bargained for.The Wages of Fear (1953) -- Henri-Georges Clouzot's classic white-knuckle thriller follows four broke, desperate men (including Charles Vanel and a young Yves Montand), stranded in a dusty Latin American town, who agree to transport two trucks of explosive nitroglycerine along bumpy, rarely traveled terrain.Bonnie and Clyde (1967) -- Arthur Penn's bloody crime picture profiles two mythic outlaws from the '20s and '30s, Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway). At first Warners soft-pedaled the movie so that it almost sank on release, but Beatty -- and word-of-mouth -- eventually made it fly. Made Faye an overnight star, and no wonder.Easy Rider (1969) -- Dennis Hopper's anti-establishment, stoner classic about two hippies on a motorcycle trip from the West Coast to New Orleans was a surprise hit in 1969, resonating with a deeply divided country. All these years later, it still earns its cult status, and is buoyed by Jack Nicholson's breakout performance.Midnight Run (1988) -- Martin Brest's hilarious road movie has Robert DeNiro's bounty hunter taking former mob accountant Charles Grodin back to custody on the West Coast. Let's just say the trip is eventful. The two stars have terrific comic chemistry, and look for Joey Pants!Rain Man (1988) -- Dustin Hoffman won his second Oscar playing an autistic savant who gets reunited with his slick younger brother (Tom Cruise) when their father dies and inheritance issues arise. The two brothers make a trip that will change them both forever. A winner from director Barry Levinson.Thelma and Louise (1991) -- Irresistible feminist buddy movie with Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon taking a one-way journey away from the lousy men in their lives. Geena and Susan are both aces, and look for a young Brad Pitt in a most unsympathetic role. Also -- that ending is unforgettable.The Straight Story (1999) -- Quiet, absolutely wonderful sleeper from (of all people) David Lynch stars Richard Farnsworth as a senior citizen who can no longer drive. When he hears his estranged brother is ill in another state, he ventures off to care for him -- driving a tractor! Sissy Spacek costars as his understandably awestruck daughter.Transamerica (2005) -- Felicity Huffman deservedly got an Oscar nod for her performance as Bree, a pre-op male-to-female transsexual who discovers she fathered a son years back, and that the boy is in trouble. Posing as a Christian social worker, Bree claims her son (without telling him who he/she really is) and transports him to L.A., with some illuminating stops along the way. Clever, funny, touching, and different -- in a good way.Looking for good movies to watch? Top movie recommendations?

While those goals aren't conflicting per se, it's easy to see how they can come into tension with each other: compressing years or decades into a film of two hours or less inevitably means that certain details and nuances -- including, perhaps, some very important ones -- will be omitted. Take Zero Dark Thirty, Kathryn Bigelow's riveting account of the hunt for Osama bin Laden that was nominated for four Golden Globes and five Academy Awards. The film came under withering criticism, largely because of its contention that ""enhanced interrogation"" (i.e., torture) provided the information that led to bin Laden's capture. A stung Bigelow told Time that Zero Dark Thirty is: ...a film. So it's got actors. It's got sets. And editorial choices, composite characters, compressions, and ellipses -- ten years compressed in two-and-a-half hours. ... Where there's clarity in the world, there's clarity in the film. ... And where there's ambiguity in the world, there's ambiguity in the film. If you look at the experts on the subject matter... they all say that some information came out of the detainee program.While it opened to nearly universal acclaim, Steven Spielberg's film, Lincoln, also elicited criticism. According to one scholar of 19th-century history, ""African-American characters do almost nothing [in the film] but passively wait for white men to liberate them. ... [it] helps perpetuate the notion that African Americans have offered little of substance to their own liberation."" Others argue that it exaggerates the extent to which emancipation came about because of the sorts of legislative compromises that the film depicts (and understates the extent to which it was brought about by radical action on the part of slaves). While these criticisms are important, there's a difference between arguing that a filmmaker got the facts wrong -- as with Zero Dark Thirty -- and arguing that he/she should've emphasized X more, Y less, etc. In addition, whatever quibbles one might have with them, blockbuster films may spur viewers to learn more about important events in which they might not have otherwise taken an active interest. Given how much we lament Americans' lack of interest in both history and current events, films such as Lincoln should, on balance, be applauded. Concordia University's David Woodard put it well: ""I always look at these films to see if a regular person who wasn't a 'Lincoln nut' would want to read a book about it after they watched the movie. I get the impression that most people who are not history buffs will now want to read something about Lincoln."""

(Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb135fb240000310096b3b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Cross-Posted from DeSmogBlogThe more things change, the more they stay the same.  Almost 11 years ago in June 2002, Environmental Resources Management (ERM) Group declared the controversial  environmentally and socio-economically sound, a tube which brings oil and gas produced in the Caspian Sea to the export market. On March 1, it said the same of the proposed 1,179 mile-long TransCanada Keystone XL (KXL) Pipeline on behalf of an Obama State Department that has the final say on whether the northern segment of the KXL pipeline becomes a reality. KXL would carry diluted bitumen, or ""dilbit,"" from the Alberta tar sands down to Port Arthur, Texas, after which it will be exported to the global market. ERM Group, a recent DeSmogBlog investigation revealed, has historical ties to Big Tobacco and its clients include ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Koch Industries. Mother Jones also revealed that ERM -- the firm the State Dept. allowed TransCanada to choose on its behalf -- has a key personnel tie to TransCanada. Unexamined thus far in the KXL scandal is ERM's past green-light report on the BTC Pipeline -- hailed as the ""Contract of the Century"" -- which has yet to be put into proper perspective.ERM is a key player in what PLATFORM London describes as the ""Carbon Web,"" shorthand for ""the network of relationships between oil and gas companies and the government departments, regulators, cultural institutions, banks and other institutions that surround them."" In the short time it has been online, the geostrategically important BTC pipeline -- coined the ""New Silk Road"" by The Financial Times -- has proven environmentally volatile. A full review of the costs and consequences of ERM's penchant for rubber-stamping troubling oil and gas infrastructure is in order.  Massive Pipeline, Massive Hype: Sound Familiar?Like the Keystone XL, the BTC Pipeline -- owned by a consortium of 11 oil and gas corporations, including BP, State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR), Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Eni and Total -- was controversial and inspired a bout of activism in the attempt to defeat its construction.Referred to as ""BP's Time Bomb"" by CorpWatch, the BTC Pipeline was first proposed in 1992, began construction in May 2003 and opened for business two years later in May 2005. BTC carries oil and gas from the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) Caspian Sea oil field, co-owned by Chevron, SOCAR, ExxonMobil, Devon Energy and others, which contains 5.4 billion recoverable barrels of oil. Paralleling the prospective 36-inch diameter Keystone XL that would carry 830,000 barrels per day of tar sands bitumen through the U.S. heartland, the BTC serves as a 42-inch diameter export pipeline and moves 1 million barrels of oil per day to market.Like today's KXL proposal -- which would only create 35 full-time jobs -- the false promise of thousands of jobs also served as the dominant discourse for BTC Pipeline proponents. The reality, like KXL, was more dim. The Christian Science Monitor pointed out in 2005 that only 100 people were hired full-time in Georgia, the second destination for BTC. ""People were told that there would be 70,000 Georgians that were going to be employed because of this pipeline,"" Ed Johnson, BP's former project manager in Georgia told the St. Petersburg Times in 2005. ""The (Georgian) government needed to sell the project to its own people so some of the benefits were overblown."" Massive Ecological Costs and ConsequencesPart of the BTC Pipeline's circuit runs through the Borjomi Mountain Gorge, an area known for its landslide hazards, and the source of Georgia's massive bounty of mineral water. The pipeline also makes over 1,500 river crossings, according to the St. Petersburg Times. Spills and explosions, both in the Caspian Sea that feeds the pipeline with oil and gas and in the pipeline itself, have also occurred. The most prominent blowout, subject to a mainstream media blackout, was the 2008 BP Caspian Sea oil platform explosion that preceded the infamous 2010 BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. BP, to this day has never admitted it was an explosion -- describing it simply as ""a gas leak"" -- but its plausible deniability cover was blown in the form of a Wikileaks cable discussing the matter, and via whistleblowers who contacted investigative reporter Greg Palast.Palast obtained information from whistleblowers in Baku who said that, rather than a minor ""gas leak,"" there was a serious well blowout akin to the Gulf disaster two years later. As in the Gulf, the well-capping cement had failed. A methane explosion from the well ""engulfed the platform.""""In fact, the workers themselves said that, like the workers on the Deepwater Horizon, they were one spark away from death, with frightened minutes to escape,"" Palast wrote for EcoWatch. ""More seriously, [its] official filing to the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission...again talked about a 'subsurface release,' concealing that the methane blew out through its drilling stack.""BTC itself also had a major explosion in its first decade of existence. An Aug. 2008 Wikileaks cable discusses a BTC explosion in a mountainous area of eastern Turkey -- where ERM said the pipeline was environmentally sound -- which spewed 70,000 barrels of oil into the surrounding area. Massive Landowner and Human Rights Costs and ConsequencesEminent domain -- or the right of corporations to expropriate private land to build projects claimed to serve the public good -- is a major concern for landowners living along the path of the Keystone XL. A parallel situation occurred for citizens living along BTC's route, with private property rights essentially eliminated to make way for the pipeline.""Host Government Agreement - the legal document on which the pipeline is based...[is a] document [that] is not simply a contract, but has the status of an international treaty, and over-rides all other national laws (except the constitution),"" explained PLATFORM London. ""It denies all future governments the right to introduce any new taxes or laws - including environmental, human rights or labour laws - which reduce the pipeline's profitability.""Environmental critics described it as the oil and gas industry becoming akin to a sovereign nation along BTC's route.""Turkey is now divided into three countries: the area where Turkish law applies, the Kurdish areas under official or de facto military rule; and a strip running across the entire length of the country where BP is the effective government,"" Nick Hildyard of Cornerstone told The Guardian in 2002, speaking to Turkey specifically but which can be applied to all countries which cross paths with the BTC due to the dictates of the Host Government Agreement. Getting rich quick has also turned out to be more rhetoric than reality for citizens whose property sits along BTC's path.""One landowner in northeast Turkey reports that he was paid the price of 7 pieces of chewing gum per square metre of his land. In some cases, no compensation has been paid at all,"" PLATFORM wrote. Activists working on behalf of human rights for Kurds explained BTC's impacts in stark terms, with the Kurdish Human Rights Project (KHPR) filing cases in the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of 38 affected villagers along the route.KHPR ""alleg[ed] multiple violations of the European Convention on Human Rights including the illegal use of land without payment of compensation or expropriation, underpayment for land, intimidation, lack of public consultation, involuntary resettlement and damage to land and property,"" CorpWatch wrote. The most shocking example of the BTC's human rights impact is explained in investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill's book Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army. He explains that the U.S. military contracted out the infamous Blackwater USA to guard Azerbaijan's portion of the BTC Pipeline and the area surrounding it. ""Beginning in July 2004, Blackwater forces were contracted to work in the heart of the oil- and gas-rich Caspian Sea region, where they would quietly train a force modeled after the Navy SEALs...[to] protect...the West's new profitable oil and gas exploitation in [the] region,"" Scahill wrote.  Grassroots Response to ERM Group in 2003As noted here on DeSmogBlog, grassroots activists responded to ERM's claim that the BTC Pipeline's Turkey portion was safe by occupying ERM's office headquarters located in the City of London, a 1-square-mile subsection of London that serves as a tax shelter for multinational corporations. It still remains to be seen what activists will do about ERM's bogus KXL study in the U.S., with the Obama State Department expected to confer with the study's ""findings"" in issuing a decision on the KXL pipeline by October. BTC's sordid history -- which ERM helped ensure -- should also enter into any honest KXL assessment.""ERM played a crucial role in gaining approval for the BTC by presenting it as a sustainable success. But this doesn't represent the reality of violence and pollution we have witnessed,"" PLATFORM's Mika Minio-Paluello, co-author of The Oil Road -- a new book documenting the slew of destructive impacts of BTC -- told DeSmogBlog in an interview. ""Supposedly an environmental consultancy, in practice ERM operated more like a PR firm representing BP and now they're fulfilling a similar role for TransCanada."""
12,DIVORCE,10 Lessons I Learned From The End of My Marriage,"Lisa Arends, Contributor
Author, wellness coach, and math teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-lessons-i-learned-from_us_5b9cf53de4b03a1dcc8346ef,When I found myself suddenly single at the age of 32 after being betrayed by my best friend and,2013-03-30,"Unhappy couple breaking. Man packing his clothes into suitcase, crying woman hugging pillow in the background. Selective focus on woman.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf53d240000500094e36a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Often, the lessons we need most are the ones we are most resistant to. I never wanted to be divorced. In fact, losing my husband, through any means, was my greatest fear in life. So, when I found myself suddenly single at the age of 32 after being betrayed by my best friend and partner of 16 years, I was lost.The best lessons can often be found when we are facing unanticipated change and loss. It is a window where we are lost and searching, broken and vulnerable, wanting and open. It is a time when the ego has been forcefully stripped away and we are able to face those challenging lessons that we may usually avoid. In those moments, we learn who we really are and what we are capable of.The following are some of the lessons I learned on the heels of my divorce:  1) When gratitude is your wrapping paper, everything is a gift. You cannot always change your circumstances, but you can always change your attitude. I wasted time after the divorce being angry and playing victim. Slowly, ever so slowly, I began to soften and to look at the bigger picture. The divorce and its associated trauma happened; I could not alter that reality. I could, however, choose to change my reaction. I have begun to practice radical gratitude -- being thankful for the man who deceived and abandoned me. I began by writing a list of ten reasons I am thankful for him and I continue to write a note of gratitude every time I make a payment on the debt he left behind. The situation hasn't changed, but I now can view my divorce as a springboard for better things.2) Happiness is my choice. I used to tell my husband, ""You make me happy."" I meant those words as a compliment, an endearment. I wanted him to know how much he meant to me. When he left, I realized that if he truly made me happy, then he also took my potential well-being out the door with him. I also began to see the unfair burden I placed on him by making him the keeper of my happiness. That was not fair to him or to me. I have learned to take responsibility for my own happiness.   3) The past doesn't stay buried. My ex husband came from an alcoholic family. He denounced their dynamics and always said that his biggest fear was turning into his father. I took his word for it; I thought he was safe from their destructive patterns since he was aware of them and wanted to make different choices. I underestimated the power of the past. If there is one thing that alcoholic families excel at, it's keeping secrets. Apparently those lessons of silence and secrets were too embedded for him to overcome. The skill set was just waiting in the wings until the right moment came along. When he began to struggle during our marriage (with money, alcohol, depression, employment... who knows?), his reflexes kicked in and he covered it up. The past is like a vampire -- if you try to defeat it solely by burying it, it will come back to bite you.  4) ""Knew"" is not the same as ""know."" I met my husband when I was just 16. I knew his family. I knew everything from the name of his elementary school to his biggest fears and wishes in life. I thought I knew him. I could describe every little nuance of my husband with the utmost confidence. It was misplaced confidence. I didn't realize that the man I knew was no longer the man in front of me. We are all fluid, changing with age and environment. Getting to know someone never ends.5) Work avoidance goes both ways. I have always had a tendency to work. A lot. I always saw that as a positive trait, an asset. It was only more recently that I realized that my drive to work was often out of a fear of what I would see if I slowed down. The divorce acted like a highlighter in my life, illuminating areas that I used to avoid through work. I learned to slow down and to trust in my ability to face the present. I now breathe through discomfort rather than try to hide from it.6) The body often knows more than the mind. For the last couple years of my marriage, I seemed to catch every cold that came through the school where I worked. I had trouble sleeping, often waking in the middle of the night. I sensed a tension coursing through my body -- a low-level, yet ever-present anxiety. Since there were no outward signs of discord in my marriage, I assumed the tension was due to a difficult time at work. I was shocked to realize, after I recovered from the initial trauma of the abandonment, that my body was more relaxed than it had been in years. I now listen to my body's messages even when they seem unfounded.   7) Wellness is not measured in hours at the gym. I used to think I was well. I ate a healthy diet, exercised daily and even managed to do a little yoga once in a while. I used to think I was well, but I wasn't. After the divorce, I had to rebuild my health and this time, I had a much more holistic and balanced approach. I became a math teacher after struggling with the material myself as a child. I was drawn to wellness coaching for a similar reason. It allows me to utilize my teaching skills along with what I have learned about wellness from a balanced standpoint after my own journey.   8) There is a difference between trust and complacency. My ex husband gained my trust over many years. He held his word and voiced his thoughts. I trusted him completely. I trusted him so much that I became complacent. I assumed the trust would remain and that he would continue to be honest and faithful. I assumed wrong. I have learned to trust again (through the help of my dog!) but I will never again become complacent. My eyes now remain wide open.9) Life is not a waiting room. I used to be an expert at delaying life. I would prioritize work and promise myself a break in some imagined future. I would squirrel away money, imaging it being saved for some mythical future. When the divorce washed away my life in one destructive wave, I realized that I was waiting rather than living. I still work hard and I'm still frugal by nature, but I no longer put life off for the future.   10) Holding is out of love; clinging is out of fear. I never would have described myself as clingy with my ex -- I was independent (often too much so), not jealous and was frequently apart from him for long periods while he traveled. It was only afterwards that I saw how clingy I truly was. With clinging, you are desperately attached to an outcome, grasping out of fear. I was clinging in a way and it was holding me still, static, unable to move. I now have healthy desires and passions which encourage investment in the now and the goal, but not in the outcomes that are out of my control. I realize that this describes my current relationship. I am so much more relaxed about the ""outcome."" Facing my fears has had a way of diminishing them. I am no less committed to the current relationship, no less in love. But it feels different. I'm not grasping. I'm holding.With some of these lessons, I am now doing master's level work. With others, I am repeating the introductory course. Either way, it is okay. The point is not to get an ""A,"" rather the intention is to be open to new lessons and to persevere through even the most difficult tutorials. I just hope I don't have to endure such a harsh teacher again!"

And with the right planning, it can actually be stress free (well, maybe not stress free, but low stress...). It's all about finding the right menu, and the right menu needs balance. A good menu has a variety of dishes that include a little sweet and a little savory, and a mix of dishes that are served hot vs. cold. Most importantly, there should be a balance between dishes that can be prepared in advance vs. those that need to be made Easter morning. The more you can do ahead of time, the happier you will be. These are three of my favorite Easter recipes that incorporate tradition, but also bring a modern, sophisticated flair. The richness of the Onion Gruyère Tart is perfectly balanced by the light and clean Tuscan Kale salad, and if there is ever a time you can get away with serving candied bacon, Easter is the day! Tuscan Kale Ribbons with Pomegranate, Grapefruit, Toasted Pecans and Shaved ParmesanLemon Vinaigrette: 1 Shallot, minced 3 Tablespoons Lemon juice 3 Tablespoons Rice wine vinegar 1 Tablespoon Honey or Maple Syrup 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard ¼ teaspoon kosher salt ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ¾ cup olive oilKale Ribbon Salad: 2 bunches of Lacinato kale, tough center stems removed, torn or cut into bite size pieces 1 cup pomegranate seeds ½ grapefruit, cut into segments ½ cup toasted pecans 6 oz Parmigiano Reggiano, 1 avocado, sliced• Whisk together all ingredients for lemon vinaigrette, except oil, until well combined. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while whisking to emulsify. • Use a sharp knife to cut out the tough midrib of each kale leaf, and discard. Slice the leaves crosswise into thin, 1/4 inch wide, slices or ""ribbons."" Place the kale ribbons into a large bowl. Drizzle with enough of the vinaigrette to moisten all the kale. Let the kale absorb the vinaigrette and soften for about 20 minutes. • Use a vegetable peeler to peel thin shavings from the block of parmesan cheese.  • Add pomegranate seeds, grapefruit, toasted pecans and parmesan shavings to the kale and toss to combine, adding more of the vinaigrette if necessary. Top with avocado slices just before serving.Make ahead: All ingredients can be prepped a day in advance, and kept separately until Easter morning. The only exception is the avocado, which should be cut just before serving.Serves 6 to 8Caramelized Onion & Gruyère Tart with Pancetta1 recipe Pastry-Dough (see below) or 1 package refrigerated pre-made uncooked pie-crust (ie Pillsbury) 2 tablespoons olive oil  8 oz Pancetta, diced 2-3 medium brown onions (about one pound total), thinly sliced Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 1-2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 eggs, plus 1 egg yolk 1 cup heavy cream 3/4 cup grated Gruyère cheese pinch of freshly grated nutmeg salt and ground black pepper• On a lightly floured surface, roll pastry dough into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 9-by-1 1/2-inch round tart pan, pressing dough into corners. Transfer to freezer to chill for about 10 minutes.  • Preheat oven to 350°. Line pastry with parchment paper or aluminum foil, pressing into the corners and edges. Cover the parchment or foil with baking weights (dried beans, rice, or aluminum pie weights). Bake crust for 15 minutes then remove from oven and let cool a few minutes. Carefully remove parchment paper/foil and weights. Poke the bottom of the pie crust with the tines of a fork (this lets air escape so the crust won't shrink). Return tart pan to oven and bake an additional 10 minutes or until lightly golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool to cool for a few minutes before filling. • Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed sauté on medium heat. Add the diced pancetta, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pancetta pieces are cooked and begin to get slightly crispy and brown. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pancetta pieces to a paper towel lined plate, leaving the rendered fat from the pancetta in the pan. Turn the heat to medium low heat and add the onions. Cook the onions, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes. • Add the balsamic vinegar, and increase the heat to medium high. Cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes more, or until the onions are caramelized. Remove pan from the heat. • While the onions are cooking, mix together the eggs, egg yolks, cream, gruyère cheese, and seasoning. • Place tart pan on a baking sheet to catch any run-off there might be. Spread the pastry case with the mustard and top with the onions. Pour egg mixture over the onions. Transfer to oven, and bake until just set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 10-15 minutes before slicing. Make ahead: Tart can be made a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before reheating. Place tart in 350 F oven for 10 minutes to reheat.Homemade Pastry Dough: 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour pinch of salt 6 tablespoons butter, diced 1 egg yolk• Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Add the butter and rub into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Add the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of cold water and mix to a firm dough. Press dough into a round disk, wrap in plastic and chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes. Well-wrapped dough can be stored in fridge for a couple of days, or in the freezer for up to 3 weeks.Sweet and Spicy Candied Bacon12 slices bacon, about 1/4-inch thick Finely ground black pepper 1/3 cup light brown sugar 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper ½ teaspoon sea salt• Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. • Combine brown sugar, cayenne and salt on a plate (I like to use my hands for this). Lay a slice of bacon onto the sugar mixture, coating it with the sugar. Flip the bacon slice to coat the other side, then lay the slice onto the prepared sheet pan. Repeat with remaining bacon slices, arranging them in a single layer on the baking sheet. Top with another layer of parchment or foil and top it, squarely, with another baking sheet (the weight of the baking sheet will keep the bacon from curling while it cooks). • Place the tray in the center of the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Check the bacon by lifting the top tray and parchment. If it is not golden brown and fairly crispy, cover again and cook for an additional five minutes (but keep in mind the bacon will get crispier once it's cooled). Once cooked, remove the tray from the oven. Use tongs to carefully remove the bacon from the tray, placing the slices on a wire rack to cool and crisp up. Bacon can be served warm or at room temperature.Make ahead: Bacon can be made up to a day in advance. Store at room temperature in an air-tight container. Bacon can be re-crisped in at 325 F oven for 5 minutes."
