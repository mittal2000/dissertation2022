Donations and letters are pouring in from across the country as the town tries to recover from the massacre. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9caf4f2200005700d955ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Powerless -- that was my gut feeling when I heard about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut. Though we live 1,000 miles away, I had a sudden need to keep my son safe, but besides checking him out of his elementary school to take him home early, there was little I could think to do. So until the end of the day, I reassured myself over and over: ""He's fine. He's fine."" And he was. My feeling of powerlessness intensified as I saw the results of numerous polls about what it is Americans think we as a nation need to do to prevent violent acts like this. For example, my colleagues at Gallup released survey results showing Americans thought more police in schools and increased government spending on mental health would be most effective. And the media and lawmakers focused in on what to do about guns, mental health, video games and the movies. As I sorted through all of the information and opinion, I had a realization. It actually came from an unlikely source -- the National Rifle Association's Wayne LaPierre stated, ""It is now time for us to assume responsibility for their safety at school."" While he used those words to make a call to arms, I believe we should all consider them a call to action.We, as parents, can play a role in preventing violence at our schools. We are not powerless. We do not have to wait on institutions that are slow-moving and hard to influence -- specifically, the federal government and national media -- to care for America's children.American parents have been boxed out of meaningful discussions about making our schools safer. Instead, the focus has been on sweeping proposals that we will be fighting about for a long time. Despite being primarily responsible for the safety and welfare of the 55 million children who attend America's public schools every day, parents are somehow not considered relevant to preventing violence in our schools. In fact, we are the front lines of school violence prevention. And there are steps we can take today. These actions all start close to home, including:  • Turn off the television and the games. Media that models violence doesn't necessarily promote violence, but it doesn't promote good will toward people, either. When your kids are focusing on screens, they aren't learning how to deal with actual people.• Monitor the wellbeing of your children and get them the help they need. Promoting the mental health of children is the best way to prevent or manage mental illness. • Teach children (meaning yours, their friends and the ones in your neighborhood, too) how to buffer themselves from daily hassles and hurt feelings. The more hopeful children are about the future, the better they deal with stress, anger, and sadness today.• Secure the guns and ammunition you own. Don't take the chance of them falling into the hands of curious children or someone wanting to harm others.• Provide support to hopeless children and their struggling families so that their personal pain doesn't lead to violence against others. You may have to put your nose in someone else's business to protect the children in your neighborhood. Work with community mental health providers to build a better social safety net for people who need more help and hope. What more can we do to take responsibility for our children's safety at school? Parents across America can tackle this question and work collectively to make schools safer. And parents, remember, we know as much as or more about protecting our children in today's world than the N.R.A., the media, and the federal government. And we have the power to do so. Shane J. Lopez, Ph.D., a Gallup Senior Scientist, is the world's leading authority on the psychology of hope. His forthcoming book Making Hope Happen will be released March 2013."

7,TRAVEL,The TSA Wants To Be Everywhere In 2013 -- Here's Why We Shouldn't Let It,"Christopher Elliott, Contributor

It was, strangely, the TSA.",2013-01-02,"PORTLAND, OR - MARCH 19: A Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer informs elderly travelers they can now leave their shoes and a light jacket on when passing through airport security at Portland International Airport (PDX) March 19, 2012 in Portland, Oregon. The TSA has modified screening procedures for passengers 75 and older and was implemented at four airports nationwide as a part of a pilot program. (Photo by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cadbc240000310094c6e2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the Minnesota Vikings faced off against the Green Bay Packers last weekend in Minneapolis, the big story wasn't that the Vikings defeated the Pack to secure a wildcard berth.It was, strangely, the TSA.That's right, the agency assigned to protect America's transportation systems was patrolling the Metrodome. Nathan Hansen, a North St. Paul, Minn., attorney, snapped a few photos of the agents before the game, and broadcast them on Twitter.""I don't think any federal law enforcement agency needs anything to do with a football game,"" he told me yesterday.Turns out the TSA goes to NFL games and political conventions and all kinds of places that have little or nothing to do with air travel. It even has a special division called VIPR -- an unfortunate acronym for Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response team -- that conducts these searches.Few people know that $105 million of their taxpayer dollars are going to fund 37 VIPR teams in 2012, whose purpose is to ""augment"" the security of any mode of transportation. They don't realize that these VIPR teams can show up virtually anytime, anywhere and without warning, subjecting you to a search of your vehicle or person.That's not a fringe observation, by the way. Even the most mainstream news outlets have reported on the problems of these random checkpoints. And it's being observed by mainstream news personalities, not just consumer advocates with a long list of grievances from their constituents.But almost no one noticed when the Department of Homeland Security signaled its intent to broaden the scope of its off-airport searches even more in 2013. Buried deep in the Federal Register in late November was a notice that could dramatically shift the focus of transportation security. It involves the government's efforts to ""establish the current state of security gaps and implemented countermeasures throughout the highway mode of transportation"" through the Highway Baseline Assessment for Security Enhancement (BASE) program.As far as I can tell, TSA is just asking questions at this point. ""Data and results collected through the Highway BASE program will inform TSA's policy and program initiatives and allow TSA to provide focused resources and tools to enhance the overall security posture within the surface transportation community,"" it says in the filing.But they wouldn't be wasting our money asking such questions unless they planned to aggressively expand VIPR at some point in the near future. And that means TSA agents at NFL games, in subways and at the port won't be the exception anymore -- they will be the rule.Still, some will argue, what's wrong with that? After all, VIPR teams were formed in response to the 2004 Madrid train bombings, and shouldn't we play it safe?VIPR may be limited to a few men and women in uniform with dogs, patrolling a sold-out stadium or convention center for now. But it's not hard to imagine the next step, to a permanent presence with full-body scans and pat-downs. It's a scene straight out of a dystopian novel and a direct affront to the Fourth Amendment values we take for granted in the United States.On another level, there's this: The TSA was created mainly to safeguard our airports from another 9/11 attack. Being scanned or interrogated by an airport screener at a ballgame makes about as much sense as getting pulled over for speeding by a National Guardsman rattling down the Interstate in an Abrams tank. You would pull over for him, sure -- but you would also have a lot of questions.If VIPR teams are somehow more effective than the highway patrol or the local police at stopping terrorists -- and I'm open to that possibility -- then the Department of Homeland Security should show us that evidence. In the absence of that, we're left to assume that the VIPR agents have the requisite 120 hours of training required of other agents, and that they are little more than warm bodies that will deter petty criminals from running cigarettes across a state line.As we start 2013, the TSA is asking the wrong questions. Instead of being a solution in search of a problem, it should be trying to slim down, get smarter about the way it screens airline passengers and leave the rest to the well-trained professionals they will never be able to replace.If we don't say something about the TSA's uncontrollable spread into almost every aspect of the American travel experience, we could one day soon find ourselves answering to someone in a paramilitary blue uniform whenever we set foot outside our door.That's not the America you want to live in, is it?"

Since traveling has become as enjoyable as the seventh circle of hell, all efforts are made to pack lightly and get through TSA with as little hassle as possible. Of course, your destination must be taken into account when packing (no one wants to show up at a ski resort with a pair of Bermuda shorts), and there's usually at least one night where you and your loved ones will indulge at a restaurant. If you spend most of your vacation slobbing around in yoga pants, a bikini and your boyfriend's comfy boxer shorts, the idea of going out to dinner and facing other well-dressed guests can be intimidating. That's where the easy-breezy dress comes in. We gave it this moniker because that's exactly what it is: easy to wear and even easier to pack. The key to these frocks is to look for something in a lightweight fabric, like jersey or silk (though the latter necessitates ironing, so plan ahead), that can be folded up wafer-thin and take up no more room than your husband's 13 T-shirts. Only one is necessary, and you can change it up with statement accessories or bold makeup.Here, 11 dresses that will wow without taking up valuable real estate in your suitcase.Want more HuffPost Style beauty content?

The costumes for the film were designed by Spanish designer Paco Delgado. (AP Photo/Universal Pictures)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cade72000003100fdaba8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was thinking it would be like roadkill.Something you know you shouldn't look at. But you do anyway. Which is followed by that horrible feeling in your gut that you should have followed your instinct and avoid it.Yup, that's pretty much how I've thought about Les Miserables for the last ten-plus years.Let me explain.I'm part of that tiny slice of the population who has never seen any version of Les Mis (but I do know that the general population refers to it as ""Les Mis""). Nor did I know what the actually storyline was about.And I've kept it that way intentionally for over ten years.You see, Les Mis was my brother Kevin's favorite musical. ""Was"" being the operative word in the prior sentence.""Les Mis was by far my favorite musical,"" Kevin said to me a few weeks before he died. ""I can't even tell you how many times I've seen it.""What I remember most about that conversation was Kevin's use of the word ""was."" And at that moment, Les Mis joined the ranks of several other painful reminders of Kevin's early-age death. Along with 35 mm cameras. Miatas. The entire month of January. And the word ""Columbine.""And over the years, I've turned down a number of opportunities to see the stage show of Les Mis. It wasn't worth the pain of pulling that scab off.But ten-plus years have passed since Kevin passed. And the truth is I'm a big Anne Hathaway fan. That's a love affair that started with The Princess Diaries and has grown ever since. So, with all the hype the new screen version of Les Mis has received, I've found myself getting the gumption to go.And go I did. The day after Christmas. With the oldest two of my three kids. They were safe companions. And they knew all too well about my trepidations.Surprisingly, for two hours and twenty-two minutes I allowed myself to be fully submerged in pure, magical entertainment. Hollywood at its finest. Spectacular cinematography and breathtaking sets. Acting excellence. And real-time singing to boot. I even dealt with the blow of (spoiler alert) Anne Hathaway's character, Fantine, dying off way too early. What the heck?But aside from that, it was two hours and twenty-two minutes of bliss. And, I'm proud to report total composure on my part.The only problem was the entire movie was two hours and thirty-seven minutes. That left 15 minutes at the end for me to go over the emotional deep end.Damn that closing scene.The main character played by Hugh Jackman, Jean Valjean, is near death while Hathaway's character, Fantine, comes back in spirit. Then Jean Valjean's adopted daughter, Cosette, who he raised for Fantine, joins the scene. And yes, all I could think about was my brother. And his final days.I got all verklempt.Over-the-top verklempt. Were there a national holiday for verklemptness, I would have been the poster boy.And there's nothing worse than getting verklempt when trying to be quiet in a movie theater while hundreds of other patrons are trying to enjoy the show. So I did what seemed logical. I covered my mouth, hoping that my liver and neighboring organs wouldn't erupt through every orifice in my head.I turned my head away from my oldest son, who was sitting next to me until I could gain some level of composure. Which I eventually did. For a few seconds. But then I began to focus on the lyrics of the finale.Then I heard those words.And remember, the truth that once was spoken. To love another person is to see the face of God.And the verklempting made a curtain call. Which lasted right through the scrolling of the movie credits.////Walking to the car, the kids were sharing their impressions of the movie with each other.""Did you notice there were no cut-aways when Anne Hathaway sang that one song?""""I liked the young guy but his throat quivered when he sang. Creepy.""""That little boy was so cute.""""The young Cosette was way better than the older Cosette.""Babbling words. And I was grateful that the two of them were talking because it masked my inability to speak.Then my oldest son made an endearing reference to my breakdown in the final scene. Busted. I thought I had covered pretty well. But he understands me. As does his sister.What they didn't understand, I'm sure, was what really sent me over the top had everything to do with them. And their little brother.////To love another person is to see the face of God.When I heard those words, I realized -- at least for me -- this was a story about one man's unwavering commitment to being a father. It's about making a promise to raise a child and fulfilling that promise no matter what challenges and obstacles knock on life's door.To love another person is to see the face of God.Hearing those words made me realize that -- while I'm certainly no Jean Valjean -- I've seen the face of God each and every day since I made a promise many years ago to be the father my kids needed me to be. Through challenges. Struggles. Valleys. I've come to know the unmatchable gift of a father-child relationship bound by a promise.////So it wasn't roadkill after all.It actually brought me a welcome epilogue to the story of my brother. I now understand why this was his favorite musical. And I'm peaceful knowing he had the wisdom of this story in his heart.And for me, beyond the Hollywood hoopla, the A-list stars, and the blockbuster production, Les Mis has now become my favorite musical, too. Because it reminds me of the most important gift in my life.And that is something I'll verklempt over until my dying day.///////////////Learn more about Jim at: BobbleheadDad.comRead more from Jim at: Bobblehead Dad BlogHear more from Jim on: Bobblehead Dad RadioJim's also on PinterestLearn more about Jim for Speaking EngagementsJoin Jim's Facebook Community"

Alas, often these things coincide. On New Year's Day, Queen Margrethe of Denmark held a special New Year's Banquet at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, just as she did last year. The main difference from last year's event: in 2013, the fashion was seriously lackluster.At 71 years old, Queen Margrethe can wear whatever she damn well pleases -- she's a dress-designing, chain-smoking, multilingual rockstar in our book, so we'll love her in anything. But Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, one of Europe's most stylish princesses, showed up in a detailed, off-the-shoulder orange gown with an extra layer of orange material cascading from the waist. We can't tell for sure if it's satin or taffeta or what, but it was certainly... shiny.Mary was out-shined by Princess Marie Agathe Odile of Denmark, her sister-in-law. Marie wore an even glossier magenta gown with long sleeves and an impressive ruffled train, visible when she turned to walk up the palace steps. We love the Danish royal family, but between the bright crinkly dresses and the tiaras, this was like Princesses Go To '80s Prom.Here's to a new year with much better royal fashion choices.

I explained that most often love overcomes family fears. I asked them not to give up on their parents. I reminded them that if I could change, so can their parents.",2013-01-02,"WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 15: A photo of a billboard of the documentary 'Bully' at MPAA on March 15, 2012 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Kris Connor/Getty Images for The Weinstein Company)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cadaf2000003100fdab9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"2012 has been a year of many ups and downs, stresses and loneliness for me as I spend the weeks away from my family. Until recently the year was ending on a down note, but you never know who is going to pick you up. After the Boston Globe article in December of 2011 the door quickly opened to telling a small part of our family story. Upon doing so there was a rush of requests to learn more about our family. It was very scary to think about the consequences of such wide-spread exposure, and in the end we turned down a long list of media requests. To continue to help others learn more about transgender youth I started to guest lecture on campus. I am often asked to lecture in the Engineering School and the Business school to introduce students to concepts and practical applications for Process Safety and Emergency Management. Now I am teaching in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and Human Development to teach others about transgender youth. Go figure!A couple of weeks ago I taught a few gender studies classes and when I was done with each lecture, half of the class was in tears, and so was I. After one class a young man came up and lingered as if he wanted to say more, but he did not know how to begin. Then he whispered, ""I wish you were my dad."" He was shaking and I could tell he wanted to say more, but the room was still crowded. I did not know what to do or say. I paused and then I told him everything was going to be okay and shook his hand. I wanted to give him a hug, but it was still hard to break the old ""Guy Habits."" I regret not giving him that hug.Just as I was gathering my thoughts, two young ladies approached the front of the classroom and told me their sad stories. As they cried and told me that their parents would never accept who they are, I tried to keep me my composure. I am well aware that some parents of my generation do not accept LGBT youth. Again I was at a loss for words, with little expertise to provide a professional response, but this time I did not hesitate to ask them if I could give them a hug. We hugged and we cried. I do not think professors typically get this personal with their students. I know I have never done so in any of my other classes. Their professor was standing on the sidelines and this scene blew her away. I peeked over at her, with a look of puzzlement, hoping for guidance, but she did not intervene.At that instant I thought about the many mistakes and successes that I had made as a parent. I told both young ladies that time might bring their parents around. I explained that most often love overcomes family fears. I asked them not to give up on their parents. I reminded them that if I could change so can their parents. I said, ""You are in the right place, enjoy college, continue to make friends and study hard, so you will have many options when you graduate."" I told them that this is the same advice that we give Nicole. I explained that knowledge and a strong work ethic would provide them and Nicole with more options if they run up again discrimination and harm. I cannot explain how powerful a moment this was and how it made realize that I have to be careful. People are looking to me for guidance and I am afraid that I might screw this up. I realized that I have much to learn and to be most helpful I must to stick to what I know best. I need to stick to sharing our journey. I need to remind myself what I have learned from Kelly. She taught me that it is okay to not have all of the answers or an immediate solution. Sometimes the best cure is to just listen and provide a well-needed hug. That afternoon was the most powerful and rewarding moment I have ever had as a college professor. I never thought I would have an opportunity to share my pain and fears in public and that the college students that typically ignore me would open up in such a personal way. I cherish the experience.As I was leaving, an engineering professor whom I know quite well was setting up for his class. He smiled and said, ""Wayne that was amazing."" I said, ""Yes it was."" Then I trying to joke, I said, ""Do you think the our young engineers are ready for the same lecture?"" He said, ""Wayne you might be surprised, I think they are."" I continue to lecture about safety, engineering and business. Each lecture is okay, but there are no hugs at the end of the class. After each lecture as they walked away with a better understanding of the topics, I wonder how they might react to my changing gears and starting to introduce them to transgender youth. Would it wake them up from the many formulas and analytical processes that are clouding their brains? I wonder who in the room might be LGBT and looking for help.I am so proud to have met all of these young people. To have shared some of our family story is rewarding and healing. Looking into their eyes, I saw the connections and I saw a bright future for Nicole and her friends. The next time I meet a young man who needs a hug I will not hesitate to offer my arms and my support. I hope you will do the same."
