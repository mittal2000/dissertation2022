And from a plain glazed one in Texas that's an essentially perfect representation of the form to a blueberry cake donut in California that has developed a legion of followers, we've tracked down the country's 25 best.Click here to see the 101 Best Pizzas in AmericaBefore we get to our list, though, there's one important question worth asking, and it's a trickier one than you might think: what, exactly, is a donut? It is any sort of sweetened, fried pastry? Well, not exactly. For our purposes, we're defining a donut as an item that you would expect to see in a donut shop : the familiar ones we know and love (of both the raised and cake varieties), crullers, apple fritters, and other donut-shop classics -- you know them when you see them.For this reason, the Cronut, an invention that's really only 50 percent donut (the other half is a croissant), and regional specialties like the sopapilla and the beignet, which are completely distinct foods that you don't find in everyday donut shops , weren't considered for our ranking. There are plenty of amazing true-to-form donuts out there, so we hewed as closely to tradition as possible (while keeping room for wild creativity, of course).Click Here to see The Complete List of Americas Best DonutsIn order to assemble our ranking, we incorporated those from last year's list but also added lots more. We stuck to strict criteria in looking for the best individual donuts in America: Freshness is key, as great donuts need to be served right out of the fryer. Are these legendary donuts that have become things of cultish devotion at the shop that sells them? We considered both plain glazed and extravagantly topped creations, but there needed to be a balance between all the components, be it bacon or blueberry jelly. Most importantly, these donuts need to be groan-inducingly good: fresh, soft, gooey, perfectly proportioned, and intended to leave you wanting just one more bite.Another quality that makes donuts such a wonderful food is the fact that they're usually incredibly inexpensive and democratic: world-class donut shops are oftentimes incredibly humble, family-run operations, selling their wares for sometimes less than a dollar. Anyone can experience a world-class donut for a handful of coins.-Dan Myers, The Daily MealMore Content from The Daily Meal:America's 50 Best Bakeries101 Best Restaurants in America"

Not to mention often the more expensive one.See more: Your New Favorite Chicken RecipeTo help me branch out a bit this fall and during the holiday season -- and I do turn to Sancerre frequently in these cooler months! -- I checked in with wine pro Will Costello, Wine Director at Mandarin Oriental, Las Vegas. Here are Costello's expert suggestions on what to reach for instead of the perennial crowd-pleaser:Frog's Leap, Sauvignon Blanc, Rutherford, Napa Valley 2011 ""When I taste this wine blind, I find myself asking if the wine was bottled with the wrong label. So much purity of fruit from the 'Rutherford Dust' that this wine, side by side with some of the greatest Sancerre, would have even the French winemakers going bonkers,"" says Costello.Michel Redde et Fils, ""La Moynerie,"" Pouilly-Fume, Loire Valley, France 2009 ""Located just across the Loire River from Sancerre, but really a world apart, this is a great alternative to Sancerre from the likes of Francois Cotat, who choose to do a small amount of oak contact on their wines. Really precise minerals, but a nice round richness which makes you think of Key lime pie or lime custard."" Nine Walks, Sauvignon Blanc, Marlborough, New Zealand 2012: ""The quintessential New Zealand style, wonderful price point -- as in you could pour for your whole 20-person dinner party for as much as the New Zealand Lamb Leg costs itself -- as well as being fresh and easy to drink. Advantage: No wine key needed -- it's a screw-top.""See more: Indulgent, Delicious BreakfastsO. Fournier, ""B Crux,"" Sauvignon Blanc, Uco Valley, Argentina 2012 ""This is a wine produced in the warmer climates of Mendoza in Argentina. All stainless steel, bright tropical fruits of honeydew melon, pineapple, and plenty of passion fruit. All of the fruit comes from Estate Vineyards, which keeps quality very high.""Peter Lehmann, ""H&V,"" Sauvignon Blanc, Adelaide Hills, South Australia 2013 ""This is a true example of a winemaker who loves Sancerre making the right choices to mimic the style. The region of Adelaide Hills has just enough cool climate to keep the fresh and racy acidity, but also ripen the grapes enough to show us some bright fruit. This has all of the grassy, herbal qualities we like about Sancerre.""What's your favorite white wine?See more from Epicurious:  Quick and Easy Dinners  Taste Test: 3 Addictive Peanut Butters   The Secret to Stress-Free Weight Loss  Back-to-School Lunch Ideas for Kids"
