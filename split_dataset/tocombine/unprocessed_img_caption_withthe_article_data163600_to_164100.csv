You know what I mean -- you decide to try a new recipe from a cookbook, Pinterest or your favorite blog and everyone loved it!If you don't have picky eaters, you are very lucky. Some of us have a picky eater that would eat mac and cheese every day if given the choice, like my five-year-old son. For me to try a new recipe isn't out of the ordinary, since I make a living planning school lunches for thousands of parents. Having him eat something totally new and out-of-the-blue... that is HUGE.Apparently, I'm not the only one. Daniela Devitt, co-founder of Yumbox, has a similar story. One day, my daughter (who was four-years-old at the time) walked over to her dad's sandwich grabbed it and took a huge bite of it. The sandwich was loaded with pesto and all kinds of good-for-you things. As a mom of a picky eater, my jaw dropped. She absolutely loved the taste of pesto and came back for more.If this happens to you, hold the urge to jump up and down regardless of how exciting the moment might be. Make this an opportunity to use this new flavor to introduce other foods. For example: pesto pizza, pesto pasta, pesto crusted fish or chicken... the possibilities are endless. From that day forward, Daniela began using pesto inside her daughter's Yumbox lunch. She figured, how bad could it be if there was pesto on it? One of the things I love about pesto is that it can be made quickly with fresh ingredients. You could buy basil at the store or grow it fresh at home. Basil is very easy to grow either in your garden or a small pot on your windowsill. By growing your own, you can get your kids involved in meal making while saving money on groceries. The recipe below is very versatile. If you can't find pine nuts or are on a tight budget, you can substitute them with walnuts. A nut-free option would be using sunflower seeds. Want to sneak additional veggies into your recipe? Try making MOMable's broccoli pesto. Pesto Tray Lunch Lunch idea by YumboxIngredients: • ½ cup extra virgin olive oil • 2 cups of fresh basil leaves (tightly packed) • 1-2 cloves of garlic • ⅓ cup of grated Parmesan cheese • 1 Tablespoon toasted pine nuts Directions: 1. Using a food processor, add half of all ingredients and pulse 5 or 6 times.  2. Add the remainder and extra olive oil until you achieve the consistency you like.  3. Pulse again until smooth. Serve immediately.  4. Pesto will keep in refrigerator for one week to 10 days.

But feeding a cold moderately, with a brisk walk, may not be a bad idea.""The classic line from every sports medicine doctor is, 'If you can do it, do it. If you can't, don't,'"" said Dr. Lewis G. Maharam, author of ""Running Doc's Guide to Healthy Running.""Usually if symptoms are confined to above the neck, exercising is OK, he explained. But if you're running a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius) or higher, skip it.Body heat rises during exercise due to increased metabolism, explained Maharam, who practices medicine in New York City. If you start high, your body's way of cooling you down is out of balance.""If fever gets too high, you break down proteins, maybe in the kidneys or liver,"" he said.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 425 million case of colds and flu occur annually in the United States. The average person has about three respiratory infections per year.Dr. David C. Nieman, a professor of health sciences at Appalachian State University, North Carolina Research Campus, said research shows that regular, moderate aerobic exercise strengthens the immune system, and that people who exercise report fewer colds than their inactive peers.Nieman said five days or more of aerobic activity per week was found to be a powerful factor in lowering the number of sick days.""Even three to four days was effective. To be avoided was being sedentary,"" he explained.But when animals infected with a systemic virus are forced to exercise in fever and pain, studies show that their symptoms are exacerbated, prolonged, and sometimes life-threatening. 'BED REST'""It's very dangerous."" said Nieman, who has written about the impact of exercise on the common cold. ""If you have flu or virus with fever and pain, the best remedy is bed rest. The worst thing is to sweat it out with exercise.""He said common cold and flu viruses can stay on objects, such as door handles, treadmills and computer keyboards, for hours. The main route to infection is through touching one's mouth or nose with unwashed hands.Patrick Strait, of Snap Fitness, a franchiser of gyms with locations worldwide, said this time of year fitness centers step up cleaning efforts because they see a lot more traffic and so many people catch colds and the flu.""It's a public place where a lot of people are sweating,"" said Strait. ""We tell manager/owners to clean once an hour, wash down the equipment with bleach, etc.""He urged clients to wipe down equipment and wash hands often.""And if you're sick, don't come to the gym,"" he said.Jessica Matthews, an exercise physiologist with the American Council on Exercise, said some days symptoms dictate scaling back your workout or, if you're contagious, skipping the gym entirely.""Always listen to your body,"" she said. ""It might be a good idea to exercise at home or privately.""Nieman said that while moderate exercise strengthens the immune system, elite athletes will experience a rise in stress hormones and a dip in immunity after about 90 minutes of high-intensity activity.Maharam said the immunity of marathoners is decreased for up to 72 hours after a race. During that time, the athletes are more susceptible to colds, flu, and, most commonly, the so-called ""marathon sniffles.""He said symptoms usually subside within 48 hours.""At the end of a race, when you're all sweaty and they're all sweaty, you don't need to be hugging and kissing people,"" Maharam said.

Enthusiasts would,2013-02-11,"This Nov. 15, 2012 file photo shows skiers hiking up the mountain at the Stowe resort as snow guns make fresh snow in Stowe, VT. The ground might be bare, but ski areas across the Northeast are making big investments in high-efficiency snowmaking so they can open more terrain earlier and longer. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cce672000003100fdb8f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Winter Storm Nemo brought multiple feet of snow to towns across New England and new life to the region’s ski industry, which had ground its way through a particularly icy January. The issue now affecting many mountains isn’t snow conditions, it's how to get skiers snowed into their homes onto the slopes, where drifts are just waiting to be carved.Monday morning’s ski reports from Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts all described the sort of “packed powder” conditions that skiers look for in the Northeast, which is rarely blessed by the powder prevalent out West. Loon, Stowe, Okemo, Snow, Killington and Sunday River are all reporting packed powder -- Killington, being massive, has a broader range of conditions -– and open lifts.The ice is buried for a few days at least and those smart enough to think ahead are enjoying glades waist deep in the white stuff. That said, New England is still New England and that means some hard chunks taking a bite out of boards and skis. Thanks to the wind, trails with less tree cover are also likely to be a little bit slicker than someone looking at a weather report might predict.But imperfection –- not to mention charming colonial towns -– is part of the joy of skiing New England. Enthusiasts would do well to hit the slopes before the late February thaw leads into mud season.The obvious question is: How exactly can I get up into the mountains? There are two different, but equally reasonable answers.The first answer involves a little White Christmas train action. Skiers can take advantage of the Snow Trains making a resurgence across the region. Hop on New York’s Ethan Allen Express toward Okemo or grab a locomotive from Saratoga Springs to Gore Mountain – lines are open though delays should probably be expected. The rides is as beautiful as any mountain is likely to be.The second answer is a bit simpler; stay close to home. Mohawk Mountain in Connecticut and Wachusett in Massachusetts (also accessible by train) are both reporting excellent conditions. The fact that neither is particularly tall also protects the bounty of white from windsheer. That said, the fact that neither is particularly tall also protects skiers from going very fast or worrying about a plethora of trail options. The important thing is to hit the slopes fast. Winter Storm Nemo’s tremendous gift is already melting. "
6,PARENTING,Social Media Training for Kids: A 60-Minute Class Workshop,"Scott Steinberg, Contributor
Keynote Speaker and Author, 'Make Change Work For You""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-and-kids_us_5b9cce27e4b03a1dcc820516,"Worried about kids and social networks? While services like Facebook, Google+, Twitter and Pinterest are among the most public of online spaces, it may help to recall that a little education can go a long way towards teaching children how to behave on them.",2013-02-11,"File photo dated 19/08/09 of the Twitter icon displayed on a laptop, as a senior police spokesman said today that there is no need for new laws to govern how the police deal with abuse of the social media website Twitter.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cce272000003000fdb8d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Worried about kids and social networks? While services like Facebook, Google+, Twitter and Pinterest are among the most public of online spaces, it may help to recall that a little education can go a long way towards teaching children how to behave and act more appropriately on these sites.Granted, thanks to COPPA laws, guidelines are pretty clear that kids under the age of 13 aren't welcome on the majority of social media services. But that doesn't mean you have to wait until young adults reach their teenage years to provide appropriate supervision and guidelines, let alone that you should just hand over the keys (or, in this case, keyboard) and let them run wild upon doing so. Following is just one of many possible social media workshops for kids that teachers, parents and other caring adults can use to educate sprouts about these sites, and surrounding issues.Start with Basic Training: A good place to start, perhaps even before you connect with tots or tweens in person, is to use a site like Grom Social, which is designed for kids, and has safeguards in place such as filtering and strict rules against forbidden activities. It's a good way to get a feel for the types of actions and activities one can engage in via social media, and in some ways functions like a social network with training wheels. But whether you're using a service such as Grom Social or talking specifically about Facebook or Twitter, you need to educate children up-front about communications basics, including what these types of platforms are good for and why people use them. Begin by spending about 15 minutes showing them kids the ins and outs of your social media account, or working together on a COPPA-compliant site.Move on to More Formal Discussions: It's also worth noting that kids and adults use social networks differently. Open the discussion by asking tots, tweens and teens why it is that they want to be on social networks, and share with them some of your own motivations for utilizing these services. It's also imperative to have a discussion about the different types of content that can be shared through such platforms, e.g. text, videos, audio and photographic images.Questions to Ask:What types of communication do you think social networks are best for?What kind of information do you hope to get via and share over social networks?What kind of information is appropriate to share, and what isn't?At the crux of all social networking is sharing. Talk about what makes social networks effective tools for interaction, how people commonly utilize them and best practices when doing so -- including what to know about how and why these companies offer their services for free. In short, spend another 15 minutes having a conversation about all aspects of social networks, before moving on to the following step.Review the Pitfalls: You don't want to focus your entire conversation on the dangers of social networks, but at the same time, it's also important to highlight what can go wrong on these platforms as a way to encourage proper behavior. Discussion topics may include, but are not limited to:Cyberbullying - Discuss what it is, and what to do when you encounter inappropriate behavior online.Privacy - Kids' personal information is the most important asset that they have. Educate them as to why they must work hard to protect it.Scams - Learn how to spot fraudulent content on social network services, whether it's Twitter DMs or fishy status updates on Facebook, and potential consequences of falling prey to these schemes.Information Permanence - As a way to impart the permanence of information, go ahead and Google yourself (chances are your students or kids have already done so) and talk about the results that show up. It's the perfect illustration of how much of what appears online tends to stay there forever, impact public perception and is not something you can always control any longer.We also suggest checking out videos from the annual Trend Micro What's Your Story contest. These are put together by kids, and highlight issues of online safety and privacy, including the very ones you'll be having in this conversation. Visit the official contest page and look at the winners together, then discuss what you saw.Setup an Account Together: When you're ready to get kids setup on social networks, take steps to configure an account together. Work together on establishing proper privacy settings, and discuss each one and what they mean. In other words, walk children through the process, providing insight and guidance all the way. This should be the last part of your meeting, and a crucial step to take, once you think they are ready (and you're ready) to setup an account.Teachers, educators and parents may also wish to remember the following tips:Go Straight to the Source. All major social networks including Facebook, Twitter and Google+ offer resource guides for families and parents, which include explanations of the services, descriptions of how to use key features, and specific discussion topics for adults and kids. Examples include:Facebook Family Safety Center - Facebook safety page featuring broad overviews as well as detailed categories for teachers, teens, parents and law enforcement.Google Family Safety Channel - Videos from Google on helping to keep kids safe online.Twitter Safety Tips for Parents - Twitter Basics page designed for parents to help answer questions about aspects of teen safety for users of the service.Be There for Them: At the end of the conversation, kids need to know that they can come to you with ANY questions or concerns. While your job as a teacher or parent is to be an educator and guardian first, it is important that they see you as a partner in online explorations. Failure to do so runs that risk that they'll work to educate themselves without your knowledge and they won't come to you if something is wrong.Respect Kids' Boundaries: Once children up and running, you need to let them spread their wings. When they start, you may want to like or comment on posts where appropriate, but quickly taper off this behavior and let them establish online relationships on their own terms, without constant reminders that caregivers are able to see everything that they're doing online."

(AP Photo/Warner Bros., Claire Folger)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ccb233c0000660009e647.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a Pan Am flight attendant who traveled often to Iran in the 1960s and 1970s -- almost up until our very last emergency evacuation flights from Tehran -- I was transfixed by the film Argo, transported back in time with a strong feeling of déjà vu. The sights, the sounds, the fury of the crowds, and even the smells that were conjured up in my memory, came rushing back to me. The overwhelming vividness of the images made me feel I was there -- now - walking on those streets, and trying to make sense of what I was seeing.Tehran was a frequently visited Pan Am destination because it was part of our famous round-the-world flights, both eastbound and westbound. The country of Iran straddles East and West, and therefore has always been strategically significant in the world. Before my first trip, I eagerly consulted our Pan Am ""bible,"" -- The New Horizons World Guide. To visit what used to be called the ""Persian Empire"" sounded exotic and intriguing. The truth was more complicated. I found Iran to be a complex country with a great deal of national pride about modernization juxtaposed with an ancient culture that bred resentment of Western culture.Replacing his father on the throne of Iran in 1941, Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi pledged to act as a constitutional monarch who would defer to the power of the parliamentary government. Instead, in 1967, the Shah crowned himself ""King of Kings,"" heir to the kings of ancient Iran. He soon after began preparations for the over-the-top 1971 celebration of the 2500 anniversary of the foundation of the empire by Cyrus the Great. Pan Am crews visiting Iran could feel the excitement -- and extravagance -- of this upcoming world event. We witnessed the building of the beautiful white monument outside of Mehrabad Airport, known as the Shahyad (King Memorial) Tower, now renamed the Azadi (freedom) Tower. Argo shows several shots of this gleaming white building, and captures the splendor of Tehran nestled at the slope of the Alborz Mountains. The scenes in the Grand Bazaar in the film were obviously not shot at the bazaar in Tehran -- a spot so familiar to those of us who loved to shop -- but it was close enough not to be distracting. The last time I ever ventured out to the Grand Bazaar was in the fall of 1979. I went with a group of flight attendants, dressed as we always were to show respect for Iranian customs and dress codes. Leaving the bazaar, walking in the middle of four friends, I noticed a strange, menacing level of activity. I nervously observed a flow of people who were either just anxiously mulling around or walking quickly, all in the same direction. Suddenly, a large well-dressed man was striding directly toward me. Before I could figure out what to do, he walked right up to me, aggressively trying to grope me. On the corner stood two policemen, watching the whole thing. From the hostile looks on their faces, I knew that if I turned to them for help, they'd put me in jail. My friends and I made a hurried beeline for a cab, and we sat there, dazed, wondering what had just happened. Even the taxi driver stared at us in a malevolent way. I knew that Tehran was no longer a safe place, and it took a while for my heart to stop beating so fast.I had one more round-the-world trip scheduled to stop in Iran. The Shah had not yet left, nor had the 52 U.S. hostages been taken. When our Pan Am crew arrived in Tehran, the air itself felt thick with anger and hostility. I found myself anxiously looking around as we boarded our crew bus. It was suggested that we try not to be seen, so I found myself sitting on the floor of the bus in the middle of an impending revolution. I sat there thinking, ""I can't believe this is happening,"" and I could only imagine what a prize it would be to kidnap an entire Pan Am crew. We arrived at the hotel safely, and it wasn't long afterwards that Pan Am began evacuating Americans. Seemingly overnight, Iran went from being America's steadfast ally, to declaring themselves to be our mortal enemy.And here is where the heroism of the Pan Am crews who volunteered to participate in the evacuation comes in. Historically, because Pan Am was known as the international flag carrier of the United States, the airline considered the well-being of our citizens to be part of the employees' commitment to ensuring passenger safety in our ""Pan Am World."" When Pan Am sent out a request for volunteers to help with the evacuation, more than enough people responded. If I hadn't been at home in Los Angeles -- too far away to get there in time -- I would have been there too! Pan Am had always been central to many evacuations and missions of mercy around the world; for example, the Bay of Pigs, Beirut, and Vietnam, to name just a few. Argo accurately portrays the atmosphere of danger, panic, and violence that these brave Pan Am volunteers agreed to face. They knew that they were putting their lives on the line, flying into the world's most dangerous place. Their individual stories are compelling, these volunteers having had a front row seat in an erupting and massive revolution.There's no doubt that we former Pan Am employees who were very familiar with Iran will collectively proclaim, ""Bravo, Ben Affleck, et al. You nailed it!"""

Now that the Superbowl is over, people can focus on what to do about the reality of football-related head injuries and how to manage risks. If you are an adult athlete, what do you do given the possible economic consequences? If you are a parent of a boy who wants to play football, what do you do? And, football is mainly a boy's sport. Girls have the greatest risk of concussion playing soccer. Which is part of why I think these are the wrong questions. Here are some that I think are more important and inclusive of those above: What is it about football culture that makes ""playing through the pain"" a norm? Why aren't girls playing and why, when they do, is their athleticism made to seem rare and exceptional, when it is not? What makes coaches and parents continue a pee-wee game in which five little boys get concussions? What kind of people are interested in making a 9-year-old girl feel special, only to have her grow up to realize that there is no place for her in the world that she loves as she gets older? Yes, the physical risks to players should be taken with the utmost seriousness, but the more important questions are about what lessons kids are learning about how to define themselves and to relate to one another.Football, like all sports, has great benefits for those who play. It's fun to be good at something, to participate in a team, belong to a community and be recognized for your hard work and accomplishments. It's also the way lots of boys bond with their dads. What I'm going to say will be anathema to many who will take my critique personally, but I'm writing about systems, not individuals or specific teams. Some of the sweetest boys I know play and some of the nicest people I can imagine love this game and are rightfully proud of their kids. But our most popular and important game is one that establishes a violent, physical, conformist, sex-based social hierarchy with strong boys at the top and ""feminized"" boys and marginalized, either sexualized or ""masculinized,"" girls at the bottom.And, I'm not talking about about sexist Superbowl advertising. Football doesn't have a problem with stereotypes. Football IS a problem with stereotypes. As wholeheartedly supportive as I am of critical campaigns like #Notbuyingit, in terms of football, this is a good start, but it's like about whether to use a blue or green umbrella to stand under Niagara Falls.What lessons are kids learning in addition to the good ones? LESSON ONE: It's a man's world. In football, girls can't often play with the boys. Even earlier than necessary, they are separated by gender. We keep getting told this. There are safety issues that NFL rules are constitutionally incapable of addressing. (These rules have changed more than 40 times since 1876, sometimes to ensure safety as they will with brain injury issues; it's just too much to figure out how to allow athletic women to play). There are, however, girls and women who play and play well. They have their own teams, and to date, have been most successful when dressed in lingerie. Or, they're slightly mocked and stereotyped. Or not that well-known. Can you name a women's professional football league? In addition, women apparently can't coach teams of male athletes in this country, especially football teams. You'd think that information is tattooed on our ovaries at birth given these statistics: There has never been a female professional football coach, only 3% of coaches in football college have been women, and there is only one female varsity high school football coach in the country. And, while diversity is a recognized issue in all sports, these concerns rarely extend to women. It's just too much for some people to even consider. Kids aren't stupid. They're just small people.LESSON TWO: Girls and women are marginal and good for only a few, narrowly defined things: How they look, if they're fertile and how well they can support their men. Women can't play the ""real"" ""game"" that everyone loves and admires, but they can entertain from the sidelines. Chances are, they're likely to be serving snacks during games as well. Or ""choosing"" to confront bias by self-objectifying. Did you watch the Superbowl halftime show? This isn't a critique of Beyoncé, a phenomenally talented woman whose show was great. This is a commentary on the role women played and the way in which we are generally allowed entrée -- pornified and bootylicious. Did you miss the skyview camera pan that captured a dozen dancers lying on their backs, opening and closing their legs in synchronicity? Or just ignored it? I have no problems with women opening their legs, but context is everything and the context for this is a game is not good. I mean, for god's sake, even the NFL's On-Air Talent lineup of 46 people only includes eight women and they are every single one of them beautiful blondes. Consider the optics of the game in general. I know that padding and helmets are for safety and cheerleaders are just wearing cute clothes, but, abstracted, their silhouettes are totems of exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, especially the men whose protective gear has gotten bigger and bigger, creating a cartoonish male profile. If I wanted to go all conservative brain, Psych 101, bat-shit feminist on you, I'd point out that the silhouette of a cheerleader holding up pompoms in a classic V looks pretty much like a silhouette of women's reproductive organs. See, I made this neat graphic. Eww. Football culture is the acme of a fetishistic conservative approach to gender. These visual prompts are related to ideas about behavior reinforced by the game and a mass media consumed by hyper-gendered stereotypes. The Achilles Effect kind that put pressure on boys play through the pain, for example. Gender stereotypes are rules about how girls and boys are supposed to be and football quite literally embodies those rules.LESSON THREE: Follow the rules and conform. First and foremost, football is a game about following established rules. All games have rules, but football is seems particularly keen on them. There are plays and game plans and many people policing them. There are lines everywhere. When you break rules, there are penalties. Refs read your infringements loudly and publicly and announce your punishment. Compare this to, say, soccer or basketball (both of which are more inclusive of women as athletes), which are fundamentally different in the way that refs work and how individual players' personalities, creative decisions and fluid responses have the ability to influence a game. It's not a stretch to say that boys who follow the ""playbook"" in games might be more inclined to similarly conform off-field. LESSON FOUR: Brute force is power and the key to success. Until recently, largely unchallenged heterosexual brute force and power. This game authorizes and regulates the use of violence. It glorifies physical domination. I know that many sports are aggressive and require the physical domination of others, but none so captures the national imagination or is so closely aligned with American masculinity. Football suggests that this equation of brute force with power and success is the basis for sex-based hierarchy off the field.LESSON FIVE: There is a sex-based hierarchy and girls are inferior, not just physically, but in terms of their humanity, and being like them sucks. There are not many other places where the routine denigration of the feminine, central to treating girls like objects to do with as you wish, isn't just condoned but integral. I'm hoping this is changing and generationally bound. But, there is no denying that football has well known ""machismo"" issues involving bonding rituals (really, just click on it) tied to ""play through the pain,"" ""smear the queer"" and ""XYZ Express"" mentalities. That's what pink locker rooms and putting tampons in gym is about. This is how helping people out of kindness is called a ""pussy on pussy crime."" These things aren't ""harmless."" They're contemptuous and they happen every day, are condoned or initiated by coaches and fathers. In exchange for winning, power, status and fraternity we ask too many boys not only to risk serious bodily harm by refusing to complain about pain or worry, but also to suppress their compassion, empathy and sense of justice.LESSON SIX: All of the above confer privilege and status. What is it about football that results in documented gang rapes having the power to ""divide"" towns and in otherwise good football fans ignoring people's pain? Parents, coaches and high school administrators, too comfortable saying things like ""boys will be boys,"" in high school end up doling out ridiculous ""slaps on the wrist"" for criminal behavior in college. By the time boys get to college everyone understands how important their athletic status is. They understand the hierarchy and act accordingly. Every single day victims are told in no uncertain terms that the careers and feelings of athletes are more important than they are.There is no definitive way to determine whether aggressive male sports cultures inclines boys more to violent crime or whether predisposed boys gravitate to certain sports. The connections between aggression, dominance, individual personalities and family, campus or team cultures are multivariate. However, for decades we've seen a steady stream of news, every kind of crime from domestic violence, sexual assault and homophobia to punctuating gang-rapes that give everyone pause. These stories often involve football -- either because football players are disproportionately involved or simply important enough to garner a disproportionate amount of attention. While male student athletes make up 3.3% of the U.S. college population, they are responsible for 19% percent of sexual assaults and 37% of domestic violence cases on college campuses. In 2010 more than half of athletes arrested were college football players. Colleges where girls have a 28% chance of being sexually assaulted -- four times the national average. Sports participation does NOT turn boys into rapists, homophobes and batterers. However, participation in high-level, all-male sports cultures indicates a propensity for certain behavior and the statistics are pretty awful. This isn't a boys are bad and criminal/girls are good and victims issue. It's about how polarized and exaggerated gender norms cultivate sex-based hierarchies that hurt everyone. This is the culture that enabled Steubenville and Glen Ridge and Notre Dame and Jovan Belcher and OJ Simpson and Jerry Sandusky to happen. The fact that Joe Paterno said, after his team lost a game, that he had to ""go home and beat up [his] wife,"" (What a kidder!) is directly related to the decades of tolerated child rape that passed before Sandusky was brought to justice. By the time an American child immersed in football culture grows up, they will have spent countless days and happy celebrations affirming these lessons. High school parents, administrators and coaches genuinely trying to educate kids to succeed in a diverse and pluralistic society should put a moratorium on playing football and start talking about what it tells kids about how to relate to each other. For many, women's ideas, especially feminists' ideas about masculinity and football, are like 19 century bastard children: everyone knows they exist and have valid claims, but we would rather ignore them. It takes a man to give them legitimacy. Men like Brendon Ayanbadejo's, Chris Kluwe's, Jarvis Green, and Donald MacPherson understand the kind of change that needs to happen. As NFL host James Brown says, so cheesy I know, ""It's Your Call."" We have choices about the ""games"" our kids play.PS: As of noon the State Department has still not recalled my passport!PPS: Here's a hat for the next game."
