More than 1.5 million pilgrims are expected to join Pope Francis for his visit to the Catholic Church's World Youth Day celebrations. Pope Francis is scheduled to visit Brazil from July 22 to 28. (Photo by Buda Mendes/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafb9722200003501db1a03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pope Francis asked a stunning question: ""Who am I to judge?"" This was in response to inquiries about whether or not there are gay priests in the Vatican -- the now-renowned ""gay lobby."" In a 90-minute interview returning from his travels in Brazil, an affable, relaxed Pope Francis covered a range of topics, but the ""who am I to judge?"" response made the world do a double take. Seriously? ""Who am I to judge?"" Well, the pope! You are the pope who inherited two millennia of, well, pontificating about what's right and what's wrong, what's moral and what's immoral. I am sure the Vatican leaders are wringing their collective hands over a pope who may be viewed as a security and PR nightmare. He may seem out of their control, dispensing mercy and off-the-cuff pastoral kindness that blurs the lines of official church policy and pronouncements. We could almost feel the winds of Vatican II blowing. My hope is that this is not just the kind of rock-star popularity that masked the sometimes-kind conservatism of John Paul II. He gave ""warm fuzzies"" to big crowds but became increasingly dogmatic as a corrupt system of financial and sexual exploitation lurked beneath the surface.Pope Francis' step toward humility was stunning, but few are naïve enough to think that everything has changed. Gay priests must still be celibate, and Pope Francis declared that ""the door is closed"" on the ordination of women. But what the pope did in that interview was to begin to live up to the Catholic Church's own teachings about humankind.Honestly, if all Christian denominations and traditions lived up to their own teachings about humanity, there would be a great revolution of respect. But that respect must include women as full human beings, worthy of greatness -- worthy of ordination -- and it must include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people.I sincerely hope this pope really does want to shake up things. Celibacy should be optional. Catholic women need the church to move into the 20th, not to mention the 21st, century and recognize their full eligibility for the priesthood. Sexual assaults on children must be eliminated. Decisions about contraception, reproductive health and choice should be in the hands of women, not by unaffected men who like to dictate policy. The use of condoms to save lives through prevention of HIV/AIDS must be commonplace. A revolution of respect can happen!Virtually every faith tradition has a core belief that human beings have inherent worth as creations of God. The inherent worth of each human being means that Christians should be aghast at the brutal murders of gay men in Russia, Cameroon, Yemen and even in the United States. In South Africa, where so-called ""corrective rape"" is used mostly against lesbians but also against transgender people and gay men, the brutality is shocking and too often endorsed by family members. Duduzile Zozo was raped with a toilette brush and left to die in early July. Bishop Tutu presided at her memorial service and famously said that he ""would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven.""Most anti-LGBTQ rapes, beatings, tortures and murders happen with little comment because it is too dangerous to report the assault or murder of a gay friend or family member for fear of police reprisal. Even with high publicity, the Cameroon police do not seem to be pursuing the person(s) who murdered gay rights advocate Eric Lembembe. Instead, Cameroon police arrested three organizers who have been critiquing the lack of action by Cameroon officials! Where are the faith voices? Pope Francis, we urge you not to be silent! Use your moral weight to stop vicious attacks and cruel persecution. Promote a campaign for tolerance. We do not have to punish people for being different!Why are Christians silent when Eric Lemembe is tortured with a hot iron in his own home? Why are Christians silent when lesbians are raped -- even raped to death? Why are Christians silent as Russia, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and so many other countries pass laws that make talking about the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people punishable by prison or fine?Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe recently condemned LGBTQ people and promised to cut off our heads. Pronouncements like these are de facto endorsements of street violence, mob attacks, family rejection and official persecution against anyone who is perceived to be LGBTQ -- as well as against their families. Mugabe is a Catholic who should hear from his new pope that violent homophobia is unacceptable for Catholic leaders. Although the pope did not suddenly change the church's view that LGBTQ people should remain celibate, whether as priests or as lay people, he did tell Christians around the world that it's time to live up to the highest values of the faith rather than descend to base disrespect for human beings.Pope Francis modeled a more tolerant approach to LGBTQ people. He is the first pope to use the word ""gay."" Tolerance is a humble platform from which people across the world can be speaking out for mutual respect. It is not a perfect platform, but it appears that it might suit a pope who doesn't think of himself as infallible but as a human being who respects God's good diversity. How refreshing!As the head of Metropolitan Community Churches, which has ministries in 40 countries, I know that it is time that Christians step up and strive to fulfill the basic teachings of Jesus: Feed the poor, clothe the naked, visit prisoners -- and, like the pope, judge not."

In fact, According to corporate communications consulting firm Rittenhouse Rankings, clear and transparent language in investor letters is indicative of reliable performance.Generally, investors assess a company’s performance by studying key financial metrics. But another useful strategy, according to Rittenhouse Rankings, is to study the language rather, than just looking at the numbers. By reviewing the language in the letters to shareholders, Rittenhouse Rankings evaluates how transparent a company is with the public. According to the report, some companies, including Cigna and Hewlett-Packard, have released letters that are confusing and lack details that would allow shareholders to better understand the company.Click here to the 10 least candid companiesRittenhouse Rankings reviews annual letters to shareholders in order to assess candor and FOG, or “fact-deficient, obfuscating, generalities.” Companies benefit in the study by demonstrating their candor and are penalized for including so-called FOG language. FOG language provides little, unclear or non-specific information about a business, and it is usually jargon.In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Rittenhouse Rankings President Laura Rittenhouse said that companies that are less transparent with their shareholders may have problems communicating candidly within the company as well. “If the CEO is communicating to the owners with this degree of obfuscation, it’s likely [he or she is] communicating this way internally,” explained Rittenhouse. As a result, employees do not know what to do, she said.The least candid companies not only produced a large amount of unspecific jargon in their shareholder letters, but, notably, they also often failed to demonstrate leadership and vision. The average company in the top 10 scored more than 3.5 times as many points in the category than the bottom 10. Top companies also received nearly three times as many points for leadership than the least candid companies.Rittenhouse Rankings’ data do not take into account several other documents that might be used as a means for analyzing candor. Among these are SEC filings and public comments by senior management. However, the shareholder letter in a public company’s annual report is an important opportunity for the CEO to articulate to all investors the most important highlights of past, present and future operations of the company. If this letter is deficient, it may point to a flaw in management’s ability to disclose the information most critical to shareholders.In order to assess candor and FOG, the 2012 Rittenhouse Rankings Culture & Culture Survey reviews annual letters to shareholders written by the CEO. Companies then receive points for demonstrating accountability, leadership, strategy and vision, among other factors. These points are then totaled and compared to the amount of FOG — or “fact-deficient, obfuscating, generalities” — these letters contain. Companies with the highest ratios of FOG to statements that show candor receive the lowest grades. The shareholder letters used by Rittenhouse Rankings for all the 10 least candid companies are from 2011. The companies included in the survey initially were selected in 2000, based on four criteria: capitalization, financial performance, Fortune 500 reputation and industry representation. Companies are replaced in the study if they cease to exist, or do not publish a shareholder letter.These are the most secretive companies, according to 24/7 Wall St.:"

One of those great immersive experiences this year is happening on Saturday, August 10 at 6:30 pm PST - the ""Richard M. Sherman and Alan Menken: The Disney Songbook"" concert. If you are planning on attending this year's expo, this concert is a must-see.  Image: The Walt Disney Company / D23Together Sherman and Menken have won a combined 10 Academy Awards for their work with Disney, and have composed music and songs for more than three-dozen Disney feature films, over two-dozen Disney Park attractions and half-a-dozen Disney musicals on Broadway. As they have said being Disney composers is ""a very exclusive club"" and that they have ""an admiring and supportive friendship.""Recently, these two Disney Legends sat down to discuss their upcoming concert and performing with each other for the first time. Alan Menken and Richard M. Sherman Image: The Walt Disney Company""I can't express how excited I am that my esteemed friend Alan Menken and I will be sharing the same bill for the very first time,"" said Sherman. ""Alan is an incredible talent, and I know we're both thrilled to be performing for Disney's most ardent fans... I can't wait to be a part of what promises to be a very special night for all of us.""  Robert Sherman, Richard Sherman and Walt Disney Image: The Walt Disney Company""Richard Sherman and I share so many things; our cherished association with The Walt Disney Company, the blessing of having the opportunity to share our musical talents with 'children of all ages' and a genuine mutual admiration--but one thing we've never gotten to share is a concert stage,"" said Menken. ""I can't think of anyone I'd prefer to share that stage with. Richard, along with his [late] brother Robert, wrote songs that filled my formative years with joy and fantasy. And, all these years later, I can say with complete honesty that there is no one I've met in our business who is more warm and generous than my friend and fellow songwriter, Richard Sherman."" For this concert Alan said, ""I am looking forward to sharing songs that people are familiar with and that they have so much investment in and songs that they never have heard of. These are songs that are so tied to the movies; they are not slotted in randomly. Each song encapsulates the movie's time, feel and characters. There is no cynicism to the Disney songbook."" Alan Menken Image: Broadwayworld.comAlan talked a little about the whole creative process. He said that the story doesn't really get written without the composers. One of the rules of storytelling is to make sure the audience is clear on what function the song will have in the movie. Sometimes it's sincere; sometimes it's tongue and cheek. They [the audience] need to make sure that the attitude, style and genre is very clear.Alan pointed out that one of the songs that he was very proud of was ""Will The Sun Ever Shine Again."" He said, ""This song was written close the 9/11 event. It captured our emotions and the emotions of everyone at the studio. I loved ""Gospel Truth,"" a song that opened up ""Hercules"" and ""If I Never Knew You"" from ""Pocahontas"" - we lost that song the first time around, but we got it back.""For this concert, as well as others, Alan said that it's always a challenge picking out just the right material for an audience. He said, ""Disney did have some requests of their own, the biggest challenge was which unknown songs or cut songs do I want to put in and contextualize for the audience. "" ""The same thing for me,"" said Richard Sherman. ""We have so many to choose from, but we try to do a sampling of various things over the years. It's like looking over my children deciding which ones to take on the outing.""How the ""Richard M. Sherman and Alan Menken: The Disney Songbook"" concert will unfold Alan said that they would just be at the piano, playing and turning and talking to the audience. Richard interjected, ""I will take a turn and then Alan will take a turn and then we are going to do a very special thing and get together and compare a little bit about our histories, what our favorite pieces are - some of our most endearing pieces to us personally."" Alan followed-up by saying, ""That the concert will be a peek at some of our non-Disney things too.""Alan and Richard have been involved in more than their fair share of composing for Disney musicals, so when they if there were other Disney films of theirs they would be dying to see made into a theatrical production they both laughed and said, ""Oh sure!"" Image: Disney TheatricalsJust finishing up a run in Chicago and then heading to Boston, Richard has ""The Jungle Book."" Past stage productions of Sherman Brothers musicals included ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"" which many think is a Disney musical, but is not, as well as the beloved ""Mary Poppins."" Richard continues to say, ""I have a couple of other things, but I don't want to talk about them until they become a reality."" ""It would be neat to see 'Hercules' come [to the stage],"" said Alan. ""We are working on a cruise ship version of 'Tangled' - who knows if that will find its way to the stage. There is a limit to these things. You don't want to over do that."" Richard followed up by saying, ""So many factors have to happen before they become a reality. I have always felt nervous before talking about too many things unless they are really on the road to happening. It's a little dangerous because then they say, 'well what ever happen to...' when it doesn't happen it hurts a little. I am right Alan?"" Alan responded by saying, Well, I tend to be a little bit of a blabber mouth."" Richard M. Sherman Image"" The Walt Disney Company / Disney Parks BlogRichard said that 90% of the songs that they wrote for Disney's animated features were written for the characters in the story and only 5-10% of the time they knew ahead of time which actor who was cast in that role. He said, ""For example, if we knew Maurice Chevalier was singing a song we would write a song for that character but one that sounded like one that Maurice would also sing. We had no idea we'd get the glorious voice of Julie Andrews to sing Mary Poppins. We wrote songs for Mary Poppins to sing.In Richard's words, ""The message that Disney fans already know but I'll just say it - there is a wonderful thing called being positive in your life as opposed to being negative. Being on the upside of the coin. Both Alan and myself have been blessed with the chore of writing things for very upbeat ideas. They are not depressing. They are not cynical. They are positive. They have strong feelings of goodwill in them. People say they get joy out of our work and feel happy about it and that truly is my reward."""

Triumph vs. Madonna's ""Material Girl"" Clothing Line",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2c982000004e00fd77fd.png?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Real or fake? Checking for crooked stitching or logo flaws often reveal a fashion fraud. But sometimes, designer knockoffs are crafted with such care that the average shopper can't spot the signs. Fortunately, some researchers in the U.K. with an eye for fashion devised a radiation technique to reveal knockoffs versus the real deal. The method involves terahertz radiation, a range of light not visible to the human eye. Using terahertz spectroscopy, researchers from the National Physical Laboratory were able to determine the specific textile makeup of the fabric being scanned.Though the team formulated the technique to help customs officials, the radiation technology has the potential to be used in a less official setting; for example, if a shopper or wholesale buyer wanted to detect synthetic silk versus the authentic material. John Molloy, a research engineer who worked on the project, described the process as a ""fast, safe and reliable test."" ""Counterfeit clothes can look and feel almost exactly like the real thing and so customs officials need technological assistance to spot them,"" he said in a statement.While some varieties of fabric may not feel very different to the touch, each type of textile gives off a distinct signature under terahertz radiation. So a terahertz spectrometer could be used to distinguish between, say, genuine cashmere and fake. However, as Salon notes, certain counterfeits could still fool the system -- but only if they were made with the same type of fabric as the original.So don't be too quick to abandon your tried and true methods of spotting a fake. A few tips when it comes to designer handbags: 1. See how heavy the metal hardware is. Light hardware often indicates a fake.2. Too-perfect stitching is actually an indicator -- a real Hermes bag, for example, is made by hand and will thus have slight imperfections. 3. For Chanel 2.55 bags, listen to how the chain straps sound when rubbed together -- the gold plated metal of the authentic Chanel chains rustle differently than the plastic-sounding fake chain.Click here for more tips on spotting fakes.Beware of copiers: Want more?
