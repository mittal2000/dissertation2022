Eure's report also details how the department routinely fails to punish officers who use excessive force. “What we’re developing here could become the national template for how do you not only investigate all levels of use of force, but how do you report it in a way that it is transparent,"" Bratton told The Times. “With transparency comes public understanding and with public understanding comes public support,"" he said.New NYPD guidelines, set to take effect early in 2016, will require officers to fill out a form called a Force Incident Report every time they use force on a civilian, even when they don't make an arrest. Cops will be required to report the level of force they use -- from physical force to the use of pepper spray or stun guns, to the use of deadly force with a gun -- as well as the race of the person involved in the encounter.Additionally, officers will now face more severe discipline, including outright dismissal, for failing to step in and prevent the use of excessive force by a fellow officer, or for not reporting excessive force. The new guidelines come weeks after surveillance footage captured a white NYPD officer body-slamming tennis star James Blake, who is black, during a wrongful arrest outside a midtown Manhattan hotel. Amid public outcry, the media revealed that there were multiple citizen complaints against the officer who arrested Blake, but the department had never disciplined him.Eure's report shows that only 36 percent of NYPD officers were disciplined in cases where the Civilian Complaint Review Board substantiated evidence of excessive force between 2010 and 2014.Officers “too often did not de-escalate encounters, failed to intervene in encounters where other officers used excessive force against members of the public -- and escalated encounters themselves,” according to the report. Furthermore, the report found that current data on use of force, and in turn, data on excessive force, is ""not comprehensive."" “A complete accounting of use of force is currently impossible because NYPD lacks a centralized and reliable way to identify and track force incidents, regardless of whether they are justified,"" the report states. Of the cases of excessive force the inspector general was able to analyze, however, black New Yorkers made up 58 percent of the victims. The NYPD reforms -- which Bratton and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have reportedly been discussing over the past year -- follow increasing national attention on police violence in communities of color. In the last year and a half, Eric Garner's death by chokehold in Staten Island, New York, the fatal shooting of Akai Gurley in Brooklyn, New York, the shooting death of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, and Freddie Gray's death while in police custody in Baltimore, among other killings, have highlighted the lack of comprehensive data about police use of force in the United States. FBI Director James Comey has since instructed police agencies across the country to report data on police shootings. In the meantime, according to The Counted, an initiative by The Guardian to track police-involved deaths, 875 Americans have been killed by police so far this year -- a disproportionate number of whom were black. Police officials in New York have long contended that most use-of-force incidents arise when suspects either resist arrest or use force against officers. Under the new guidelines, officers will also start tracking when force is used against them. Patrick Lynch, president of the city's largest police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, predictably blasted the new reforms. Cops need ""support, not more reports,"" he wrote in an emailed statement on Thursday. “No amount of new training or additional paperwork will make necessary force that is lawful and properly used by police officers acceptable to those who want to return to the hands-off, reactive policing strategies that sent crime soaring in the past,"" Lynch said.""More paperwork coupled with a serious shortage of police officers and the continual second-guessing of their actions is a formula for disaster,"" he added. ""It is a call for police officers to disengage themselves from the very proactive policing that brought this city from the brink of disaster in the 1990s."" Donna Lieberman, executive director at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement that “today’s announcement is a welcome recognition from the NYPD that use of force is a serious problem and that we need real data in order to have real reform.""“We, like many New Yorkers, are concerned that what happened to tennis star James Blake is just one example of the harm suffered by countless New Yorkers at the hands of the NYPD, whose stories have largely remained hidden to the public,” Lieberman added. Priscilla Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Communities United for Police Reform, an umbrella organization for nearly 30 social justice groups, called Bratton's announcement Thursday a ""positive step,"" but added that the NYPD also needs to start tracking ""disciplinary actions taken for use of force cases, not just those reported and substantiated by CCRB.""

3,POLITICS,Every Republican 2016 Candidate Turns Down Invitation From Latino Conference,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/latino-conference-presidential-candidates_us_560d8b9ae4b0768127013703,"Except Donald Trump, who wasn't even invited.",2015-10-01,Spokespeople for GOP presidential candidates Mike Huckabee (left) and Marco Rubio both cited scheduling conflicts as the reason they won't be speaking at an upcoming Latino conference.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- When hundreds of Latinos gather next week for a candidate forum at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute conference, they won't hear from any Republicans, though not for a lack of trying on the part of the organizers. CHCI spokesman Irving Burbano said the group contacted every presidential campaign except that of GOP candidate Donald Trump about the Oct. 7 candidate session, but only two Democratic candidates are scheduled to attend: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton won't be at that session, but is speaking at the conference the following day.The nonpartisan, nonprofit Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute hosts a public policy conference in Washington every year with Latino leaders and officials, as well as an appearance from President Barack Obama. Organizers expect more than 1,000 people this year for the conference and more than 500 at the candidate forum specifically.Candidates often have busy schedules. But at a time when they are competing for Latino votes, very few are seizing the chance to speak to this ready-made audience.HuffPost reached out to all of the campaigns invited to the session. Spokespeople for GOP candidates Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee cited scheduling conflicts. A spokeswoman for Democratic candidate and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee said he is unable to attend. Other campaigns did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Other Republicans to decline the invitation, according to Burbano, were U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Ted Cruz (Texas); Govs. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Chris Christie of New Jersey; and former Gov. George Pataki of New York.Democratic candidate and former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb (Va.) did not respond to the invitation, Burbano said, nor did three Republican candidates: former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum (Pa.) and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. (The group did not contact Larry Lessig, who is also running for president as a Democrat.)Trump was not invited because of his disrespectful statements about Latinos, not any policy stance, Burbano said. The outspoken businessman will get a chance to talk at another Latino-focused forum the next day, when he appears at a U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce event Oct. 8. An immigration-focused forum in Iowa this August was similarly ill-attended by candidates. O'Malley and Chafee were the only candidates there.Also on HuffPost:"

""So my plan is, I'm just talking about it constantly to state and local law enforcement, saying this is in everyone's interest who cares about sound policing, sound public policy, and to use the bully pulpit of this office to say 'You've got to give it to us, you've got to give it to us.' Those are the tools I have."" The FBI plans to “collect more data about shootings (fatal and nonfatal) between law enforcement and civilians"" and increase overall reporting, Comey said this week. Incomplete FBI data suggested there were only 444 justifiable police homicides in 2014, a number known to be inaccurate because a large number of law enforcement agencies fail to voluntarily turn over that information. Earlier this year, in a speech about race and policing, the FBI director said it was ""ridiculous"" that we didn't know how many citizens were killed by the police each year. But he was hesitant to say whether he believed he should be able to force law enforcement agencies to provide that data.""I don't know how that would work,"" Comey said on Thursday. It would be ""possible"" to tie federal funds to the reporting requirements, so that law enforcement agencies that failed to report their data wouldn't have access to federal grants, he said.""That wouldn't be a Bureau thing; that might be a Congress enacts something that gives the attorney general that authority,"" he added. ""I don't know; I know what I have the ability to do, and that is talk about it and talk about it and talk about it."" The fatal August 2014 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, drew public attention to the lack of accurate data on police killings. Both The Guardian and The Washington Post have tracked deadly encounters with police officers so far in 2015. As of Thursday, The Guardian had counted 875 people killed by the police, while The Washington Post had counted 741 individuals who had been shot and killed by an officer. Comey also said he was ""very concerned"" about increased murder and violent crime rates in many U.S. cities, but said he wasn't sure if we could say what was causing them.""I think all of us need to figure out what is going on here,"" he said, adding that police chiefs across the country had told him they are seeing ""huge spikes"" in violent crime. ""Something very, very worrisome is going on,"" he added.Yet Comey placed rising violent crime rates in important historical context. He said the U.S. is ""in a place where I never imagined we would be as a country,"" back when he was a federal prosecutor in the 1980s and early 1990s and believed that New York City would ""never get below 2,000 murders"" per year. (The city had over 2,000 murders per year in 1991. In 2014, the number had dropped to 328 -- the lowest number of murders since the New York City Police Department began collecting statistics in 1963.)Comey said he didn't know whether protests against police violence have made it harder for police to do their jobs, a theory that has been dubbed the ""Ferguson effect."" ""I'm not discounting it, but I just don't know,"" he said, adding that he was ""focused on it, trying to figure it out.""""Some have said police officers aren't getting out of their cars and talking to gang-bangers on street corners anymore, but I don't know,"" he said. ""What I do know is that a whole lot of people are dying. They are, according to the chiefs, overwhelmingly people of color, and we've got to care about that.""The spike in crime made him want to be ""thoughtful"" on criminal justice reform, Comey added. ""My strong sense is that a significant portion of the change in our world since I was a prosecutor in New York in 1987 is due to law enforcement, but I'm sure there are lots of other things [going on],"" he said.""I just want to make sure that as we reform -- first of all, we're grateful that we actually have the space and time to think and talk about sentencing better, rehabilitating better, and [that] is a product of hard work over the past 25 years -- but as we do it, are very, very thoughtful about where we used to be and how we got from that point to here,"" Comey said."

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Boehner's likely successor, had praised the committee -- which was established to investigate the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya -- for hurting 2016 Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's poll numbers. Democrats jumped at the comments, calling for Boehner to immediately disband the committee and accusing Republicans of creating it for the sole purpose of attacking the former secretary of state during her bid for the White House.“This investigation has never been about former Secretary of State Clinton and never will be,"" Boehner said in a statement Thursday. ""Indeed, the Select Committee’s very existence is only the result of the Obama administration’s obstruction of routine congressional investigations and its failure to properly comply with subpoenas and document requests.""The statement is further evidence of the slip-up McCarthy made, which has also been criticized by members of his own party as ""inappropriate."" Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) told CNN on Wednesday that McCarthy's comments were wrong. “I totally disagree with those comments,” Amash said Wednesday. “I think [they] should be a concern."" Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), another conservative member, took issue with McCarthy's comment as well. McCarthy made the comments during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Tuesday.""Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?"" he said. ""But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee, what are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping, why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened.""House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) scolded Republicans Thursday for creating the committee ""with a political purpose in mind.""“It’s really an ethical question,"" Pelosi told reporters. ""It makes the whole operation practically an unethical operation. I think the Republicans should shut it down.""Pelosi implied that at some point Democrats may stop participating in the Benghazi Committee investigation.""How long we will participate depends on how serious they are. And we haven’t seen any signs of seriousness,"" she said.This post has been updated with comments from Pelosi.Also on HuffPost:"

Joaquin, which strengthened into a dangerous Category 4 hurricane on Thursday and battered sparsely populated Bahamian islands, will strengthen in the next 12 to 24 hours, the National Hurricane Center reported. Its current path has it nearing North Carolina and Virginia on Sunday or Monday, but mid-Atlantic and Northeast states will experience minor to moderate flooding over the weekend regardless of whether the hurricane makes landfall.Joaquin's quickly progressing strength can be tied to unprecedented sea surface temperatures in the hurricane's vicinity, Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, told The Huffington Post.""Joaquin has been traveling over a record-warm ocean surface and undoubtedly that has contributed to its rapid intensification,"" he said. ""In a very basic sense, warmer ocean surface temperatures mean there is more energy available to strengthen these storms. So we expect more intense hurricanes in general in a warmer world.""A map from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows the temperatures in Joaquin's path at a ""record warmest.""Climate Nexus, an organization dedicated to clean energy solutions, warned that because oceans expand as they absorb heat, that gives Joaquin ""a higher platform from which to run up onto land"" and increases the threat of severe flooding. The sea level in the New York Harbor, it noted, has risen nearly a foot over the last century.""There is not uncertainty about sea level rise,"" RAND researcher Jordan Fischbach told Time in August. ""As we get more sea level rise, these large storm events will with certainty damage ... assets and people.""Because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture in the air, Climate Nexus noted, hurricanes are loaded with more potential for destructive rainfall. Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, explained the phenomenon last month while discussing recent flooding in Utah and Arizona. ""When the right weather system comes along,"" he told HuffPost, ""that weather system can be thought of as a device for reaching out -- quite a ways at times -- and grabbing the available moisture and bringing it in and dumping it down.""Mann warned it's likely we'll be seeing more hurricanes of Joaquin's strength.""Based on our work, climate change is already leading to both more intense and larger hurricanes than before,"" he said.

Wade In 1974,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-abortion-1974_us_560c5ee3e4b076812700b4d6,"""I don't think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body.""",2015-10-01,Perhaps the vice president has evolved on reproductive rights?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560c768318000052008316c1.jpeg?cache=uDiv9GYOWn&ops=crop_25_155_2932_1675%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As a freshman senator, Joe Biden gave an extended interview for a Washingtonian magazine profile in which he told writer Kitty Kelley that he was not entirely on board with Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that had legalized abortion nationwide the previous year.""When it comes to issues like abortion, amnesty, and acid, I'm about as liberal as your grandmother. I don't like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don't think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body,"" Biden said in the June 1974 article.Today, Biden is a staunch supporter of abortion rights. The Huffington Post reached out to the vice president's office to ask when he evolved on the issue and what made him change his mind. A spokeswoman said that there'd been no evolution and that Biden's comments were taken out of context.""As with much of this article, then-Senator Biden was taken out of context. The Vice President is and has been a long-time supporter of a woman's right to choose,"" the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.During that portion of the interview, the 31-year-old senator was talking broadly about how he does not hold doctrinaire positions, which might have angered the once-powerful liberal group Americans for Democratic Action.""I don't care how that damn Americans for Democratic Action rates me,"" he said. ""Those ADA ratings get us into so much trouble that a lot of us sit around thinking up ways to vote conservative just so we don't come out with a liberal rating. When it comes to civil rights and civil liberties, I'm a liberal but that's it. I'm really quite conservative on most other issues. My wife said I was the most socially conservative man she had ever known. I'm a screaming liberal when it comes to senior citizens because I really think they are getting screwed. I'm a liberal on health care because I believe it is a birth right of every human being -- not just some damn privilege to be meted out to a few people. But when it comes to issues like abortion, amnesty, and acid, I'm about as liberal as your grandmother. I don't like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don't think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body. I support a limited amnesty, and I don't think marijuana should be legalized. Now, if you still think I'm a liberal, let me tell you that I support the draft. I'm scared to death of a professional army. I vote my own way and it is not always with the Democrats. I did vote for George McGovern, of course, but I would have voted for Mickey Mouse against Richard Nixon. I despise that man.""Elsewhere, Biden noted that ""someone like Adlai Stevenson"" -- a twice-failed Democratic presidential candidate and onetime darling of liberal intellectuals -- ""is a good man but he's much more liberal than I am.""In the years after he spoke with Kitty Kelley, Biden became a champion of the Violence Against Women Act, burnishing his liberal credentials with that 1994 law. He lost points with progressives over his treatment of witness Anita Hill during the 1991 Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings.He also lived up to his promise to take not-so-liberal positions as a leader in ratcheting up the drug war, pushing mass incarceration with the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and seeking to deregulate Wall Street and boost credit card companies domiciled in his home state of Delaware."
10,POLITICS,Intelligence Chief Puts New Spin On Claims Of Slanted ISIS Reports,Ali Watkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-clapper-isis-intelligence_us_560d5a72e4b076812700fedf,Where does the responsibility for faulty intelligence lie?,2015-10-01,"James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, noted the role of the Defense Intelligence Agency in coordinating reports.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_62_381_5297_3168%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In little noticed remarks Tuesday morning, the nation's top intelligence official appeared to spread the blame in the unfolding scandal over the U.S. Central Command's alleged botching of intelligence reports on the Islamic State. It may not have been entirely CENTCOM's fault, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper suggested. ""The intelligence assessments from CENTCOM or any other combatant command come to the national level only through the Defense Intelligence Agency,"" Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""That is the main conduit … [the] evaluator and filter for what flows into the national intelligence arena.""Clapper was responding to a statement from Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), who used part of his allotted questioning time to address recent claims that intelligence reports on the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, were deliberately slanted. Analysts working out of Central Command allege that they were pressured to soften their assessments in order to make it appear that the U.S. strategy against the extremist group was succeeding.""As a member of both this committee and the Intelligence Committee, I want to, in the strongest terms possible, impress upon you the importance for all of us to receive absolutely objective and unbiased assessments,"" Heinrich said.The Defense Department's inspector general is looking into the claims. Clapper said he would wait until that inquiry was completed before passing judgment.""It is an almost sacred writ in the intelligence profession never to politicize intelligence. I don't engage in it and I never have, and I don't condone it when it's identified,"" Clapper stated. “Having said that ... in spite of all the media hyperbole, I think it's best that we all await the outcome of the [inspector general] investigation to determine whether and to what extent there was any politicization of intelligence at CENTCOM.""Brian Hale, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said Clapper's remark wasn't meant to suggest that the Defense Intelligence Agency had a hand in the CENTCOM mess.""[Clapper] is merely describing the process of how military intelligence from combatant commands is integrated into national intelligence products,"" Hale said.In a statement provided to HuffPost, Hale went on to detail the process by which intelligence reports are funneled through CENTCOM.""During routine video conference sessions, the [Director of National Intelligence] engages with the command in the presence of the Joint Staff. All updates provided by the command are strictly limited to tactical developments such as what happened on the ground overnight regarding issues affecting US personnel and allied forces. They are not broad or strategic assessments,"" Hale said. ""None of the combatant commands are permitted to engage directly in the [President’s Daily Briefing] process at all, rather they are funneled through [the Defense Intelligence Agency] to ensure that all substantive deliberations and final contributions are appropriately coordinated.""Clapper's comments at Tuesday's hearing add a new twist to an already tangled narrative. Earlier media stories suggested that the manipulation of intelligence began and ended at CENTCOM, with analysts charging that higher-ups sent their reports back down to the analyst level when they weren't happy with the implications.The Director of National Intelligence has faced his share of suspicion over the alleged slanting of intelligence. The Guardian reported that Clapper maintained a ""highly unusual"" degree of contact with the head of CENTCOM's intelligence wing, Army Maj. Gen. Steven Grove -- a relationship that some former officials speculated could have put heavy, if unintended, pressure on the unit to fit its analysis to the policy goals of Clapper's White House bosses.That's a worrisome possibility less than 20 years after the country's last intelligence fiasco. Wounds are still raw over the Iraq War, when slanted intelligence assessments, driven by Vice President Dick Cheney, suggested that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein fostered closer ties with terror groups than he actually did."

Developed in the U.K., Topmix Permeable was formed in response to the 2007 floods where more than two thirds of the 57,000 damaged homes weren’t flooded by swollen rivers. Rather, they were affected by water running off pavement or overflowing from the overloaded drainage systems.The issue is that the majority of existing drainage systems are designed to remove rainwater as quickly as possible and funnel it into watercourses or drains. As a result, during heavy rainfall, public sewer systems quickly reach capacity and consequently overflow.To offset the flooding issue, the permeable concrete functions as a reservoir, and delays storm water from discharging into watercourses or drainages systems, according to the U.K. company.Another added benefit is the technology’s effectiveness in removing pollution from rainwater runoff. Stormwater is easily contaminated by petrol, diesel, detergents and other pollutants. Still, the technology has its limitations and is best suited for lesser-trafficked locations. It doesn’t work for highways and heavily trafficked streets, and is more conducive to such urban terrain as residential roads, parking lots, driveways and patios.As concerns over climate change grows, experts say that engineers, city planners and architects need to start paying closer attention to developing more efficient water draining systems, ThinkProgress noted.“In general, for a long time when we thought about environmental consequences in buildings, water wasn’t one of the big ones [that regulatory authorities] thought about -- we thought about fire, we thought about human health and air quality,” Dana Buntrock, an architecture professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told ThinkProgress. “Water is getting more attention now.”Also on HuffPost:"

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Rep. Chris Gibson (R-N.Y.) hosted the event with the sustainable business group Ceres.Whitehouse has been a major advocate for climate action in Congress, giving weekly speeches on the subject. And Gibson recently led an effort among House Republicans to get party leadership to pay attention to the problem. Gibson said he's ""optimistic about the future"" and about finding ways to ""open up conversation"" on climate. ""Certainly there will be areas where we disagree, but that's not as important as the areas where we agree,"" he said. He also talked up efforts to expand access to solar energy, like the Department of Energy's SunShot program, and the conversion of a coal-fired power plant at the U.S. Army's Fort Drum installation to biomass. The food companies said climate change poses a risk to their ability to do business. ""We fundamentally rely on Mother Nature to provide the ingredients for the food we serve,"" said Kim Nelson, senior vice president for external relations at General Mills. ""If left unaddressed, [climate change] represents a variety of risks to our company and to our planet."" Nelson said the company relies on products like cocoa grown in West Africa and almonds grown in California, two regions afflicted by climate-change-driven drought. The food industry, by virtue of its reliance on agriculture, is inherently affected by climate change, Nelson said.Those five companies, along with Kellogg, Stonyfield Farm, New Belgium Brewing, Danone and Clif Bar, also signed onto a letter published in the Washington Post and Financial Times arguing that ""now is the time to meaningfully address the reality of climate change.""""We are asking you to embrace the opportunity presented to you in Paris, and to come back with a sound agreement, properly financed, that can affect real change,"" they wrote. ""We are ready to meet the climate challenges that face our businesses."""

Morgan Stanley, Piper Jaffray and Jefferies are listed as underwriters on the transaction. Morgan Stanley is the most senior, or “lead-left,” bookrunner.The roadshow to market the company’s shares is scheduled to begin Oct. 20, with the stock to be priced Oct. 28, according to a document produced by the underwriters. The deal is code-named “Rockit,"" the document obtained by HuffPost shows. ""Rock.It"" is the name of company founder Jimmy John Liautaud's 197-foot, 11-inch yacht.Reuters reported in May that the company was planning a public stock offering that would value the company at more than $2 billion, including debt. In 2014, the company reportedly explored the sale of a “major stake” to additional investors. Jimmy John’s has about 2,000 locations, Reuters reported, and most of those stores are owned by franchisees. The company has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of about $150 million annually, according to Reuters.Many low-wage Jimmy John's workers have been asked to sign controversial non-compete agreements as a condition of working in the company's stores, HuffPost’s Dave Jamieson reported last October.Jimmy John’s franchise owners are frustrated by what they feel is a shift in how the company treats them, from a feeling of partnership and cooperation early in the company’s history to a sense of disdain and dismissal more recently.One contentious issue is the rollout of a new credit card security system. Jimmy John’s confirmed in September 2014 that it was hacked through its point-of-sale system, allowing unauthorized remote access for about two and a half months. The company has stuck with the same security company, Signature Systems, despite serious concerns raised by an outside security analyst hired by franchisees. The company’s IT head is a former general manager with no background in technology, security or vendor management.The company also, without explanation, said at the end of December 2013 that it would change the way it reimbursed corporate-owned store drivers for mileage beginning Jan. 1, 2014, according to a company email. It moved from paying drivers 5 percent of the sale to 56 cents per mile. The company did not inform franchise owners until May 2014 that paying drivers a percentage of a sale, as had been standard practice embedded in company-provided software, was not technically a reimbursement under federal labor law.Jimmy John's declined to comment, as did spokeswomen for Morgan Stanley and Jefferies. Piper Jaffray did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This post has been updated to note Jefferies and Jimmy John's declined to comment."
