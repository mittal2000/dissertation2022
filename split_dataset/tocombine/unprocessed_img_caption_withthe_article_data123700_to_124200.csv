0,WELLNESS,Understanding Habits Helps You Change Them,"Nicole Kosanke, Ph.D., Contributor
Director of Family Services, Center for Motivation and Change",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/habits_us_5b9dfacae4b03a1dcc8fd301,Alcohol abuse is often treated like a completely different (and shameful) habit to change than others. And there are indeed,2014-04-11,2014-04-11-Fotolia_60718627_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-11-Fotolia_60718627_Subscription_Monthly_M-thumb.jpg,"People repeat actions that are either rewarding or familiar, or both. In other words, people do things that feel worth it somehow. You might think immediately about things you do regularly that don't exactly feel rewarding -- maybe work or commuting or taking vitamins. But if you think carefully about the reasons you do each of these, you will see that there is some benefit or ""reward"" that comes from doing them. It might feel like a different way of looking at it, but the benefit or familiarity exists strongly enough for things you continue doing otherwise you wouldn't be willing to repeat them as you do.Understanding why people repeat actions helps shine some light on why or how they would stop repeating actions or change a habitual pattern. First of all, changing a behavior pattern is made much easier when it feels worth it! The reasons to change toward doing something new have to feel weightier than what you're getting out of the current behavior. To use a relatively minor issue as an example, if coffee tastes good to you and helps you have energy in the morning (you get something out of it), you're unlikely to change that habit of drinking it every day, unless you have a pretty compelling reason! Maybe a reason like having heart palpitations or increased anxiety or your doctor tells you to stop. But even then, you might not want to stop or might really struggle in stopping, because you really enjoy the taste or you dread the headache you might get from stopping or you might really miss this familiar, comforting habit you've had in your life for many years. Adding to all of that, it might feel awkward or lonely to not drink coffee in the morning with your partner or your colleagues who are all drinking coffee each morning together. That's how the downsides of change start to add up and eclipse your view of the reasons in favor of changing. Now multiply those issues by 100, and perhaps it's easier to understand how difficult it might be to change a more ingrained habit like some people have with drinking alcohol.In order to change a habit, it has to really feel worth it and the downsides of changing have to either be pretty small to begin with or be shrunk down. For instance, for certain changes -- like perhaps changing one's tooth brushing routine or changing the path of a commute or changing a habit of eating one snack over another -- the downside of changing might be quite small, but if the advantage of the new behavior does not feel compelling, then even those small hassles that are a part of changing might be enough to keep you from trying the change at all. On the other hand, if the reward of the new approach feels clear and salient, those small downsides will be more easily overcome.I'm talking here about weighing the pros and cons. As a strategy coming from the therapeutic approach of motivational interviewing, detailing the pros and cons of one's current behavior can help illuminate the reasons you want to change (or don't). Also helpful is to detail the pros and cons of making a change (in other words, detailing both the pros and cons of an existing habit like drinking coffee in addition to the pros and cons of changing that habit -- what is good and bad about stopping drinking coffee). This strategy helps to highlight the ways you might influence those reasons or build upon them. The process of shrinking the downsides of change -- or alternatively, increasing the salient reasons to change -- is something a whole community can participate in! We do it as a community when we tax cigarettes. We do it when we make decaf coffee or nonalcoholic beverages readily available at a gathering. And in a relationship, it can be done by planning together or brainstorming alone about the different upsides and downsides of change that are within your control to influence. Will it be easy for your partner to start a new exercise plan? Are there obstacles in place that you can work together to decrease (for instance, by arranging childcare, changing dinner times, getting the right equipment at home, etc.). You might feel aggravated that the value of being healthy and living longer isn't sufficient reason to motivate your partner toward this change, but remembering the rewards of the current set of habits and the downsides of making the change can help to increase your understanding and empathy. And looking at the pros and cons can also help you think more strategically about how you can work together with a loved one to decrease the obstacles or ""cons"" to change in your lives.Alcohol abuse is often treated like a completely different (and shameful) habit to change than others. And there are indeed some important differences when it comes to substance abuse, but the similarities with making big behavioral changes of all kinds are really important (and useful!) to recognize. One important similarity is this idea of behaviors being continued and repeated when they feel worth it (despite what feels from the outside like obvious reasons to stop!). Another is how useful a detailing of pros and cons can be for all involved. Many families and individuals do not address substance abuse early enough because it feels like a problem that is unique and involving character traits that feel intractable (so better to turn a blind eye and hope that's not the case). But in fact even substance abuse can be understood better and addressed more productively when the pros and cons are more carefully understood. If shame gets in the way of thinking about change constructively, the shame itself can be factored into the pros and cons list. Thinking of the ability to make changes as a skill to be honed is also helpful. And one of the ways to build that skill is learning to use strategies like a pros and cons list.Shame and fear are big downsides to making changes -- but they don't have to be insurmountable obstacles! You can work on shrinking them just like any other downside to change you might encounter: with patience, compassion, planning, starting small, and allowing others to help. Shrink the downsides to change, enhance the upsides of change, and work together!Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

Indeed, some city playgrounds have such fabulous features -- with hands-on construction, musical instruments or cool old-school features -- that they are destinations in themselves. Here are seven city playgrounds worthy of a break from sightseeing:Adventure Playground: Berkeley, CA First opened in 1979, this playground in the Berkeley Marina lets kids play on quirky structures -- or better yet, just build new structures with hammers, saws, and paint. Filled with plywood, painted tires, a zip line, and even the occasional abandoned piano, it feels like a whimsical (but safe) junkyard -- which, no surprise, has made it a beloved institution. It's meant for ages 7 and up, though younger kids can play if parents stay with them. (The playground also requires a reservation if you bring more than five kids in your group.)Franklin Square Playground: Philadelphia This family favorite is located in Franklin Square, one of the five original squares William Penn devised for Philly. The playground itself has swings, climbers and spinners, and sits next to a carousel ($3 per ride), a mini golf course ($9 per adult, $7 kids 12 and under) and fabulous lunch option Square Burger.(MORE: Find a kid-friendly hotel in Philadelphia.)Powell Barnett Park: Seattle (photo: Seattle Parks & Recreation)The climbing equipment at this acclaimed Leschi neighborhood park looks a little like the motherboard inside a robot, with slides -- irresistible for junior acrobats. The park also has a variety of wacky spinners, a summer wading pool, Frisbee field, restrooms inside a mini castle and a circuitous tricycle maze. (MORE: View a family trip plan: 3 days in Seattle with kids.)Koret Children's Quarter: San Francisco This playground in Golden Gate Park dates back to 1888, and is thought to be the nation's first public playground. Highlights include climbing walls shaped like giant ocean waves, an elaborate rope-climbing structure, a huge, historic concrete slide (you slide down with cardboard) and a Herschell-Spillman carousel built in 1914. The carousel is open weekends year round, and weekdays between Memorial Day and Labor Day; rides are $2 for adults, $1 for kids.Imagination Playground: New York City At this hands-on playground -- built on a former loading dock by Manhattan's South Street Seaport -- toddlers can dig in a huge sand area (or, come summer, play in the spray area), while bigger kids can build forts and ramps with giant foam blocks, mats, fabric and tires. Built to look a little like one of the old ships that used to dock here, the play area also has a ship-rigging-like rope climbing structure and a crow's nest lookout.   Rotary Playground at Liberty Park: Salt Lake City This downtown Salt Lake City park features a Freenotes section, with giant musical instruments such as xylophones, drums and chimes. Other parks with Freenotes installations are in Moab, Utah, and Durango, Colorado.The Geometry Playground: Oklahoma City A project of San Francisco's Exploratorium museum, this traveling exhibit-meets-playground features a corkscrew tunnel, a contraption that lets you roll a giant gear to draw with colored pencils, and a 10-foot, climbable gyroid. It will be at OKC's Science Museum through June 2014, then it moves to the Museum of Ancient Life at Thanksgiving Point, in Lehi, Utah, until June 2015. Admission is $12.95 for adults, $10.95 for kids. --Katrina Brown Hunt contributed this to MiniTime.com."

A defiant, festive mood prevailed Sunday as the London Marathon began on a glorious spring day despite concerns raised by the bomb attacks on the Boston Marathon six days ago. London's is the first major international marathon since the double bomb attack near the finish line in Boston, which left three people dead and more than 170 injured, including many who are still hospitalized. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dface2400005000954930.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Mitch PhillipsLONDON (Reuters) - ""You're virtually there"" is a common shout of encouragement to ailing runners in the London marathon but thanks to a new ""interactive 3D experience"" athletes the world over will be able to navigate the course from the comfort of their own treadmill.Marathon organizers have combined with established treadmill video producers Paofit to create the new system that combines HD video of the entire 26.2 mile, icon-studded route with virtual reality avatars.Over 30,000 people will run the actual race on Sunday but more than 130,000 others were unsuccessful in the ballot for places that closed after nine hours. Since the inaugural event in 1981 almost 900,000 people have completed the race but almost two million have been rejected.Now, people training for the race, as well as those who missed out, can get a taste of the course.""It's a fantastic innovation,"" race director Hugh Brasher told Reuters on Friday shortly before running a treadmill mile as part of the system's official launch.""You can see the famous landmarks of the Cutty Sark, Tower Bridge, Canary Wharf, the London Eye, the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace and even experience the thrill of the finish on The Mall.""It's certainly the next-best thing to doing the race and turns what could be a dull treadmill run into a really exciting experience.""With the interactive technology you can even race against a friend on the same part of the course, even if they are in another town or even another country.""Brasher, and fellow race directors from the New York, Tokyo and Chicago marathons, formed a team for a 4xone-mile relay at the London Marathon's expo in Docklands on Friday.After some embarrassing technical problems that brought the launch to a shuddering halt in front of a somewhat bemused crowd, the ""race"" was eventually up and running and showed just what is on offer.A camera car drove the course minutes before the start of last year's elite race and that footage appears as an unwinding road, complete with barriers, roadside fans and eager aid station volunteers, on a video screen.""The blue line is there, the sun is out, it looks fantastic and it's exactly how the course looks for runners,"" Brasher said.""It's difficult for people to visualize the course in normal circumstances with all the traffic etc., but this really lets you get the feel of what it's like on race day.""You can determine your own speed too so you can get some understanding of how fast Mo Farah and the rest will be going on Sunday.""An avatar, and other runners' avatars you can link to, show the runners' positions on the course.Marathon organizers have already released a free one mile ""taster"", beginning around the 12-mile mark of the course, just before Tower Bridge (www.paofit.com).Over the next few months more will become available to individuals, gyms, health clubs and hotels, in 5km increments with the full course available by October.Organizers are hoping for an alternative mass participation event to coincide with the start of the 2015 race on April 26.It is Sunday's race, however, that is at the forefront as the presence of Britain's leading athlete and marathon debutant Farah has caused a massive uplift in interest and an expectation of record crowds.""This is his home marathon, we helped support him through his training programme when he was at St Mary's University (in south-west London), and for him to run his debut marathon as a double Olympic and world champion is special,"" Brasher said.""I know London is going to come out and support him in an amazing way and it will be like recreating the 143 decibels that rang round the Olympic Stadium for 12 1/2 laps when he won the 5,000metres on that memorable night - but for 26.2 miles.""(Editing by Toby Davis)"
3,WELLNESS,What Are You Projecting Onto the Movie Screen of Your Mind?,"Maria Portas, Contributor

Whatever it is that you think and feel will be projected onto the vision of your mind, and that is what you will see and experience in life.This does not mean that everything here does not exist. It does exist. But what doesn't exist is the comparison of experiences that we are now living. You see, everything here is neutral, we are all energy pulsating out into the universe. The chair you are sitting on, the bed that you slept on -- all vibration. The very being that you are is always vibrating and the force that is being transmitted is thousands of times more powerful than you may have ever imagined.There is a force in the universe. And guess what? You are it! This force is a magnitude of love, emotions and consciousness all enveloped into one. What you think, feel and take action towards matters to this earth. You are a powerful being of light emerging from the dark. The more you connect to your being, who you truly are, the brighter that light begins to express through you. Either way you are giving out energy, but the choice is now yours. Will you help and improve the earth or will you be a victim of creating by default and then blaming everything outside of you now. Which one is it going to be?You have a magnificent power within you and you are able to create what it is you want. You also create what you don't want, and that is by putting your focus on that area too. So you want to change your reality, you want to change what you see right now?It is possible, and, we must also remember that we must also take time into account. So although you may want something right now, there may be a time lapse, but that's good right? Imagine all our thoughts being splattered out in the world. Pretty crazy huh!So time saves us a lot of embarrassment (if you know what I mean), but the more you focus on and become a vibrational match to what it is you want then the closer you get to creating it all. Here is where you need to get very clear on what it is you want. Be aware that everything you see is a manifestation of your thinking up until now. So if you are not seeing what you want, know that you have the power to change what it is that you see from now on. You can change the reality you are now experiencing. Everything is a lesson. Everything people say and how they behave towards you are all showing you exactly what it is that you think of yourself. As you increase what you think is possible for you, the world will also show you your worth. We are the ones that block our greatest gifts. So what is your world reflecting to you? What stories are being played in your world?Look at different situations and whatever it is that you are seeing in another, then reflect that back to you and see where you are doing the same too. For instance, if someone is not valuing you, where are you not valuing yourself? In how many ways are you doing this to yourself? Change this and you change the relationship too. It is amazing the power you have. We are at cause of everything that happens to us now. When we shift our thoughts, our world also releases the constraints that we have given out.Your power is given to you to create what it is you want, but we use it for everyday tasks, some important, some not. What if you knew how great you are? What if you knew that what you have been given affects the very world that you live in. What choices would you make? If you have everything within you that another has, and at the same time it is unique to you, then wouldn't it be important for you to intentionally live a life that makes a difference in this world?You have been brought here for a reason. We have been conditioned by society to live a certain way. To do and accomplish certain tasks to make us citizens of our country, to be able to fit into the constraints of daily life. But we are people of the world. We belong to the universe. We need to think bigger than the walls that we live in. We need to explore how each of us are creating this world. It is yours to be, do and have what you will.It is Done. In One, In All, In Love. Maria Portas.For visions of a better world and life go  here."
4,STYLE & BEAUTY,Conscious Uncoupling in the Beauty Realm: Breaking Out of a Makeup Rut,"Napoleon Perdis, Contributor

While the slightly... odd phrase created a social media storm and spurred a number of articles from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and TIME (to name just a few!), as a makeup artist, I began to think how this thought process could apply to other realms -- particularly the makeup bag. There comes a time where I think everyone (even the most famous) needs to reevaluate their regime, and reassess what is -- and isn't -- working for them... Like Gywneth and Chris, sometimes it's just time to move on! A glowing Gwyneth Paltrow-consciously uncoupled from bad beauty habits!Too Much of a Good Thing People are often surprised to hear me advise clients that less is more. I've adored the nude look for several seasons, but this guideline is more about evaluating what you really need vs. applying a full face of makeup because that's what you've worn for years (or even decades!). Women often cite mascara as their ""desert island"" beauty product, but apply it at the end of their makeup regime each day. Apply mascara first for immediate definition and you may find you don't need much else. Proper skincare and a top-notch primer can also work wonders toward perfecting skin so you can avoid heavy, mask-like foundation -- the ultimate offender in this department.   Barely-there makeup, flawless finishGetting Stuck in a Rut  Any happy relationship requires the acknowledgment that people grow and change over time, so why hold onto the same makeup long after the honeymoon is over? Nothing dates your overall look quite like a makeup statement that's been around since Miley Cyrus was Hannah Montana. Talk about a girl who's not afraid of change! Shocking transformations aside, the easiest way to keep your look fresh and age-appropriate is to visit a makeup counter each season for an update. If nothing else, your skincare and foundation absolutely need to adjust with the seasons and you just might find a new shade or formula to fall in love with. I've seen nude lip gloss devotees go mad for a bright lipstick when they give it a try. There's no cheating in makeup so you might as well experiment and have some fun! A bold lip is an instant image upgradeSticking with ""What Works"" Just like with dating, sticking with techniques you swore by in your teens or twenties can backfire down the road. Concealing your under eye area seems simple enough, but as any woman over 30 knows this area can become a minefield of fine lines and caked concealer with the wrong product or technique. I developed my Hollywood V method to create the bright-eyed, well-rested look flaunted by starlets of all ages on the red carpet. Apply concealer in a V-shape from the inner and outer corners of the each eye, meeting at the top of the cheekbone. Apply only what's left on your brush directly under the eye. This concentrates coverage where most discoloration occurs and prevents a heavy layer of concealer caking in fine lines. Bright-eyed at the Alex Perry show during Australian Fashion WeekThe brilliance of makeup is that it can inject your life with a bit of fun and variety but requires little to no commitment whatsoever... unlike most relationships. I will, however, ask you to give a bold lip 12 minutes before consciously uncoupling it from your look. What may not be love at first sight can blossom into a beautiful relationship, or a signature look!"

The boat carrying the Kaufman family became the site of a U.S. Navy rescue Sunday, April 6, 2014, after the family's small daughter, 1-year-old Lyra, became ill. None of the three federal agencies that helped rescue the ill toddler and her family from their broken down sailboat about 900 miles off Mexico's Pacific coast plan to seek reimbursement for the cost of the operation. Officials from the Navy, Coast Guard and California Air National Guard said Tuesday, April 8, 2014, they don't charge for search-and-rescue missions. ""We don't want people in trouble at sea to hesitate to call for help for fear they'll be charged for assistance,"" said Lt. Anna Dixon of the 11th Coast Guard District, which oversaw the operation but did not send vessels or aircraft to the stranded sailboat. She said that helping at sea is a time-honored tradition and a requirement of international maritime convention. The Navy warship that picked up the family on Sunday is expected to reach San Diego on Wednesday. (AP Photo/Sariah English, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dfaa5250000360036aafb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BY MARTY GRAHAM SAN DIEGO Wed Apr 9, 2014 10:59pm EDT(Reuters) - A family of four rescued from their sailboat after their infant daughter became seriously ill at sea returned safely to San Diego on Wednesday aboard a U.S. warship that picked them up in the Pacific over the weekend, a Navy spokeswoman said.The parents, Eric and Charlotte Kaufman, and their two daughters, 3-year-old Cora and 1-year-old Lyra, left the Navy frigate Vandegrift after the ship arrived in port around 10 a.m. local time and were taken to see their family doctor, according to Lieutenant Lenaya Rotklein of the Third Fleet.Rotklein declined to give any further information about the arrival of the Kaufmans at Naval Air Station North Island on San Diego Bay except to say all four family members were ""stable when they departed"" and were met at the port by relatives.The Kaufmans, whose boat was their home but are from San Diego, did not speak to reporters on their arrival.The family was two weeks into a planned around-the-world cruise on their 36-foot (11-metre) sloop when Lyra developed a fever and rash, prompting her parents to send a distress call to the Coast Guard by satellite phone last Thursday.In addition to the child falling ill, the family reported that their boat, christened the Rebel Heart, took on water whenever they tried to start the vessel's engine, the Coast Guard said.A four-man rescue team from the California Air National Guard was dispatched by military plane to the scene, about 1,000 miles out in the Pacific off Mexico, to render medical assistance. The team parachuted into the ocean and boarded the family's vessel late on Thursday to treat the child.The rescuers then remained on the sailboat with the family until the Vandegrift, which had been conducting routine operations off the Southern California coast, arrived on Sunday to take all four Kaufmans aboard for a return voyage.The Kaufmans' crippled sailboat, listing badly and considered a navigation hazard, was scuttled by the father himself, who cut holes in the vessel and then watched it sink after he was taken off the yacht on Monday morning, Navy officials said.News of the family's plight generated considerable online chatter about whether the parents had exercised poor judgment in embarking on a round-the-globe sailing voyage with an infant and a toddler.Defending their decision to set sail with their young children, Eric Kaufman issued a statement from sea on Sunday saying, ""This is how our family has lived for seven years. ... We remain confident that we prepared as well as any sailing crew could.""Lieutenant Colonel Nando Polo of the Air National Guard said the father approached him after the family arrived in port and ""basically apologized for putting us through all this.""""I told him he did fine, and he doesn't owe anyone an apology,"" Polo said. ""Even when things went wrong for him, he made all the right decisions. He saved his family.""(Reporting by Marty Graham; Writing and additional reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Johnston, Jonathan Oatis and Ken Wills)Copyright 2012 Thomson Reuters.
