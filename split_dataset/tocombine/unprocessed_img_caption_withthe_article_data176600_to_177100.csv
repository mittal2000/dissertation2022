Rushing out the front door with my high school teenage daughter after fixing breakfast, walking the dogs, filling their silver dog bowls, and somehow finding time to put make up on and prepare for a full day as a director of a high-end salon was my typical Monday-through-Friday routine. It was Thursday, Dec. 8, 2011. It was anything but routine. It is the one Thursday I will never forget. My daughter, Breea, needed to use my car to go to her first collegiate cheerleading training class after school. She dropped me off in front of my work and disappeared down the street. I took a deep breath and tried to mentally focus on the day of work ahead. By 6 p.m. she was at the front door to the salon and barely able to walk. The next day I was staring at a brain MRI. Her brain. The white area that was not supposed to be there was enormous. Her condition continued to deteriorate. She could not talk or swallow, was now blind in her left eye, and was completely paralyzed on her left side of her body. The diagnosis: acute sudden onset of tumefactive MS.I was in complete disbelief that a disease I knew so little about, and that what I did know didn't add up to what I was witnessing, was taking over my only child's life. Her doctor kept telling me this was a rare and catastrophic onset. At first he wasn't even sure he could categorize it as MS. That word ""catastrophic"" would echo for days in my mind and led me to the hospital computer room, where I began my research on this mysterious disease. I ended up absorbing tons of information and medical facts about MS. I learned that it affects 400,000 Americans, and more than 2 million people globally. I learned that it is an autoimmune disease that attacks and destroys the protective covering on the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, called myelin. I learned that when the damage is done to the actual nerve itself there is no way to repair it. I learned that most living with MS never have to use a wheelchair. They never become disabled from the disease. Onset typically occurs in the 20- to 50-year-old age group. Multiple sclerosis affects women much more frequently than men. I discovered books and support groups for those living with MS and kids who have parents living with MS. What I didn't find was support for me, a parent of a teen with severe MS, and even less support for Breea. At least I could talk to people my age with the disease and get some information out of a conversation that I could possibly apply to our situation. Even then, I was a parent with a child who had been stricken so violently with a catastrophic onset. She was the teen lying in a bed helpless to a disease that, from most accounts that I read about, affected people my age. Will she graduate? Will she ever walk again? Will people accept her like this? Will she accept herself? Will she cheer again, go to college, ever be able to have children... the list went on and on. According to Breea's doctor, less than 1 percent of all those with MS have the kind that Breea has. Most never experience what Breea has had to endure. But recent anecdotal reports from the U.K. show that MS is showing up in kids as young as 5 years old. Pediatric MS now makes up between 2 percent and 5 percent of the population of those with MS. According to the National MS Society, the earlier the onset, the more likely one is to accumulate significant disability at an earlier age compared to those with adult onset of MS. It appears to be creeping into the lives of a much younger population. Why? The medical community has no idea... yet. Still, these facts don't really support my daughter's type of MS. She didn't experience the typical slow onset, minor symptoms, no disability. She experienced the worst of the worst, and with all the research I did, and eventually began to include her in when she was ready, we never really found anything to help her via a support group or even one person her age to talk to so she didn't feel so alone. We became each other's support, each other's comic relief, each other's sounding board and shoulder to cry on. We were, in a sense, in this together. The other aspect I did not find much information about is the emotional and social impact a disease of this nature can have on a young adult. The emotional and social impact MS has had on my daughter has been nearly unbearable at times. She became the girl in the chair at school, the one people stared at at the movies, the one who wasn't sure if she would ever be what she considered to be normal again. She went from being a cheerleader to not knowing if she would ever walk again in one day. Not from a car accident or sports injury. She wasn't doing anything to cause this ,and there was nothing she could do, a decision she could make, to stop it.But there was something else happening inside of her that was as mysterious as the disease attacking her brain. It was her resiliency and ability to gain insight through it all that began to shine through. I began to see the years of resiliency developing habits and choices I had made as a single mom shine through in her character as she chose to stand tall and take one step forward at a time. She told me once that she used to be on the other side of making remarks about people with disabilities. She wouldn't be doing that anymore. She told me she thought she knew who her friends were before; now, she knows who they really are. She told me feeling sorry for herself would not heal her lesions, but focusing on her dreams would give her the strength she needed to be the best she could be. The lessons just kept on coming. She told me she would graduate with her class. She told me she would walk again. She told me she would still go to college. She did them all. Today Breea is still in a leg brace and working hard to gain all of her strength back in her arm and leg. Her vision is perfect. Her cognitive skills are getting better, and she is starting all over again when it comes to cheer. She recently did her first backbend with me there supporting her. It was a pretty special moment. Another special moment was when we were asked to give a presentation for the National MS Society-Pacific South Coast Chapter. We have become passionate advocates for young adults living with MS, parents, and caregivers. It seems to me that tragedy has a strange way of bringing people closer to their purpose. Yes, we were blindsided by MS. I lost my job while on medical leave and lost the daughter I used to see running and cheering and tumbling. She lost her ability to walk normally and now lives with the reality of being diagnosed with this frightening, unpredictable disease. But we never lost hope. We never lost sight of how important love and laughter is. We never stopped being creative in our approach to recovery and therapy. We never gave up and today, with research being done via stem cells and other advanced medical technologies, we will never stop believing that one day there will be a cure.

Patagonia Books™ ©2012. Used by permission of Patagonia Books ™, www.patagonia.com/booksAbout a year-and-a-half later I wheeled Cormorant, just completed, scuff-free and freshly painted, across the sand on a jet ski cart to launch for the first time. The lifeguards questioned the presence of an 18-foot boat on the beach, but I would not be deterred. I had checked the law, and with no motor on board I was permitted to launch from any beach as long as there were no swimmers near. This I relayed in an even-but-insistent tone, adding that I had the situation well in hand and that I was ""a trained professional.""Academically at least, I knew how Cormorant was meant to work, but in truth I had only ever sailed in a dinghy once or twice before, 25 years earlier. I had never rowed a boat either, so launching through the surf on my first outing may not have been the best idea. But June 4, 2007, was a gentle, warm day with little waves, and I wanted to establish my right to access the ocean just down the street from my house.At the water's edge I pulled Cormorant off the expensive, balloon-tire cart I had bought. A small surge lifted the hull, and I shoved off and leapt aboard and took up the oars. My stroke missed completely, which sent me sprawling off the midships thwart, wriggling on my back like a sand crab on the floorboards. The next little breaker caught the boat sideways and jostled her back to shore. ""A trained professional...""I quickly regrouped and pushed off again, the oar blades biting in this time, and I pulled forward, up one row of jumbling foam then over a small, cresting swell and soon across the smooth water beyond the surfline. Here I had the chance to pause and acknowledge the fact that I was actually floating. Cormorant was a functioning boat, a true vessel -- a means of moving through the world. There was the curve of the gunwale, the stout mast with the halyard run through the top and coiled at its base, the rich color of the tanbark sail. A few more strokes, and I went forward to hoist the main.Hoist the main! On my own boat!The breeze puffed just lightly, the sail billowed out as if by magic. Cormorant coursed forward, a miracle.The sea was like pewter under a high ceiling of clouds. Cormorant reached northwest passed the end of the pier, the breeze picking up a little once I cleared the rock stack of West Reef. The ocean stretched before me, Catalina Island a distant shape on the horizon, and I wanted to sail onward for days and days. I came about and ran back in to the pier, then put out to sea again, farther this time. The bluffs of San Clemente became small off the stern, the houses on the hills impressionistic dabs of white. The sea lit up gold on its scalloped edges when the sun dipped away late in the evening.Night fell as I ran in again, but I did not want this dream to end. ""Bound is boatless man,"" goes the Viking proverb, and I hadn't known how true that was until now. I passed the pier well off the end and decided to come about again and sail out to sea once more, my eyes adjusting to the dark."
2,DIVORCE,Children And Trigger Points,"Henry Gornbein, Contributor
Family Law Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/children-and-trigger-poin_us_5b9c5210e4b03a1dcc7dca2e,"Over the years, I have seen many divorces in which right after the final judgment is entered, the parents agree to disagree",2012-09-25,Sad looking girl with her fighting parents behind her,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c5210240000510094a113.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the years, I have seen many divorces in which right after the final judgment is entered, the parents agree to disagree on child-related issues. There are certain issues that parents seem to continuously disagree on, prohibiting them from getting along and moving on with their lives. Here are some examples: 1. Extracurricular activities.  I had a case recently where the mother enrolled her son in one baseball league and the dad enrolled him in another. The result is that the child is missing games in each league and there is no consistency. How is that good for the child? 2. Summer camp. One parent wants the child in summer camp, and the other parent is against it. Let's say the parents get over the hurdle and agree to enroll the child in summer camp, but one parent decides that the days that the child is with him or her, the kid won't be attending camp. Again, the fight continues and the child is the one caught in the middle. 3. Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts. One parent may enroll their children in organizations such as these but the other parent refuses to participate and refuses to make sure that the child goes to his or her activities. Again, the child is hurt by being put in the middle and by the pettiness of divorced parents who cannot move on. 4. Dance/Gymnastics/Karate and other activities. Again, one parent will enroll the kids, the other parent will disagree and a battle ensues. I have seen many judgments of divorce that say that the parents must agree on all activities, and that they will share the costs. If they don't agree, then one parent can opt to enroll the child but must pay the costs. This solves part of the problem, but does not resolve the issue that when the child has these activities, each parent should be responsible for making sure that the activities are attended. Too often there is a dispute over pick ups, drop offs and attendance. I have even seen a situation where one parent not only refused to go to a recital, but made it difficult for the child to attend it. What are these adults thinking?  5. School. I have seen numerous battles about where the children will be attending school. This happens every summer and fall. Will they be staying in the same school district? Will they be home schooled? Private school? Public school? Will they be in a parochial or other religious school? These are issues and should be talked about during the divorce. They should not be allowed to fester. In too many cases, they become trigger points for the continuing battle. One solution I've seen is that if one parent is willing to pay for parochial school, and both parties agree in writing, then that becomes an enforceable obligation going forward. If one parent is willing to pay for a prep or private school, or there is an agreement for sharing these expenses and it is in writing as part of an order or Judgment of Divorce, courts will enforce it. Home schooling versus public schooling can also be an issue. 6. Attendance. I have seen many cases where one parent is not good at getting the child or children to school. The result is that there are many instances of tardiness and/or absences. This is something that must be addressed. The child or children are the ones being hurt here. School is important and children should not be late; parents should make sure that schedules are coordinated so that schooling is a top priority. 7. Homework. This is an issue that often festers, along with school notices. I seen a lot of cases where one parent is not advised on the homework assigned. Homework is usually brought home in a backpack or book bag, and parents should check that backpack or book bag every night. Make sure that your child's homework is done. Make sure that everything is kept current. Communicate with your former spouse about these issues. 8. Science Fairs and other special projects. There should be communication and coordination regarding school projects. One parent may be overseeing the project and the other parent may be lackadaisical and not doing anything. Other times, one parent will sabotage the other on science fairs and special projects. Put your children first. Stop fighting. 9. Medical issues. Medican issues are often contentious. There may be battles over the need for orthodontia work, the need for certain elective medical procedures, whether or not the child should be on ADD/ADHD medicines or even if such a diagnosis is true or not. A child's need for tutoring or counseling may also be trigger points for battles. Again, what is best for your child? Do you have to take these cases to court? If you do end up on court, you may spend many thousands on dollars on attorney fees -- much more than the actual costs of these medical procedures or special needs. 10. Allergies.  A new partner may bring pets into the relationship; some children are allergic to pets. This is definitely something to watch out for. What about children who are allergic to certain food substances? Or smoke or dust? These can become issues after divorce. I have seen cases where people have had air filtration and testing done because their kid developed allergies or asthma, either because one parent smoked or adopted a pet after a divorce.These are all trigger points for conflict long after the divorce is over. You must always ask yourself, what is in the best interests of the children? Can we, as adults, put our children first and somehow stop the fighting? Too often, the answer is no. That is why some of these issues become trigger points that will be litigated for years -- long after the divorce is final. It is te result of one or both parents not being able to move on or not being willing or able to let go. A good solution may be to appoint a therapist of attorney to be a guardian and represent the children; they may assist in making the tough decisions, and they have the authority to make recommendations to the court. This can be an expensive tool, but it can be a powerful one and I have found that it can be very helpful.  These are some of my thoughts regarding the endless battles involving children. What are your thoughts and comments?"

Join the club; in 2011 we spent about $4.7 trillion (yes, trillon!) in retail sales, according the U.S. Commerce Department.And who hasn't overspent at one time or another? With new merchandise refreshed every season, every month--or, at discount retailers like Target and T.J. Maxx, every week--department stores can be a minefield if you go in uninformed. Especially since stores are designed to make you drop as much cash as possible.Floor layouts, salespeople's strategies and even storewide sales tap into our most basic consumer impulses. But not this fall: To help you engage in smarter retail therapy, we asked two former department store employees to reveal their juiciest secrets so you save more.1. Start at the Back of the Store One evergreen retail strategy is to bury the best discounts-clearance items, especially-in the rear of the store, so you'll encounter racks of beautiful new merchandise before you get to the real nuggets.Furthermore, stores will try to influence your purchases by advertising their current sales, even the smallest ones, heavily throughout the store, says Abby*, a former salesperson at a high-end New York City department store. ""A lot of times, the best deals are not during the big advertised sales,"" she says. ""Usually the best sales items are on a rack toward the back or slightly hidden.""2. Befriend Your Salesperson Salespeople aren't just trying to make sales on the spot. They're motivated to keep customers apprised of future deals, too, because they have sales goals to meet during those promotions. Ask a clerk to put you in her client book and to call or email you about other sales as they happen.A lot of stores will let even let you come in a week or so before the actual promotion and hold the merchandise you're interested in, then email you when the sale begins. That way, you get the item at a discounted price before the sale officially starts; the industry term for this is a 'pre-sell.' ""They'll swipe your card, save the info, keep your merchandise packaged up in a special area, and give you a claim ticket to come back once the sale begins,"" says Abby. Of course, the secondary motivation for a pre-sell is to get you back in the store to spend more, so make sure to return armed with the will power to pick up only what you already purchased.3. Aim to Save at Least 30% ""Generally speaking, a sale isn't really worth it unless you're saving at least 30%,"" says Abby. ""And there's always a sale happening in which you can save at least 30%."" So if you're the type to cringe when you have to pay full retail, wait for the stuff you're coveting to be introduced into the sale rotation. (Again, getting extra chummy with your salesperson means you might get tipped off to just when that is.)4. Request a Price Adjustment If you spent more on a full-price item than you're comfortable with and having retail remorse, go back within seven days and check to see if that item's been marked down, says Lisa*, a former high-end department store manager. Most stores will honor a price adjustment within that time frame, as long as you've kept your receipt and it's a hard markdown (meaning the sale price is clearly indicated on the tag). The most foolproof way to avoid losing your receipt? Ask to have it emailed to you, and pull it up on your smartphone when you need it.5. Beware of Bundled Promotions Avoid buy one, get one deals (known in the industry as BOGOs) and similar bulk sales that are designed to encourage you to buy more merchandise than you ordinarily would. If you're spending more than you intended to, you're not really saving, Lisa reminds us.6. Don't Look to the Right Research shows that most shoppers are right-handed and instinctively look to the right, so that's where stores put the newest and most expensive stuff. To encourage that instinct, stores will often add extra lights and music to that area to entice you to come closer. The answer? Go into the store with an idea of what you need, and don't get distracted by display tricks!*Names have been changed.More From LearnVest Take Charge of Your Money With Our Free Bootcamp!I'm a Recovering ShopaholicTales of a Compulsive Online Shopper... 10 Sizes Too Smal LearnVest is the leading personal finance site for women.

In July we learned of a honey producer there who was robbed of 3 million bees. In August, there were reports that $30 million worth of maple syrup had gone missing from Quebec's strategic reserves.Now, as summer draws to an end, reports have surfaced of a vast cheese-smuggling operation in Ontario. No joke.The alleged scam, reports CBC News, hinges on smugglers sneaking cases of ""brick"" cheese from the U.S. into Canada, then selling it to restaurants and pizzerias.Because of restrictions by the Canadian Dairy Board, cheese is markedly cheaper south of the border, meaning that a case of American smuggled cheese could go for $150, while the same cheese produced in Canada would cost around $240. According to the CBC, one trip for a cheese smuggler could earn between $1,000 and $2,000.And this isn't just fly-by-night cheese smuggling, either. The Ottawa Sun has reason to believe some Niagara Falls cops may be in on the deal. When pressed, Const. Derek Watson told the paper yesterday the force cannot ""deny or confirm allegations of any ongoing investigation."" Reached for comment by the UPI, Brandon Elms at Volcano Pizzeria in Fonthill, west of Niagara Falls, said he'd been approached a couple times by Canadian investigators trying to track down the sources of discounted dairy.""We get all our stuff legit,"" he said.

While driving, hiking and biking are great ways to peep a leaf, sometimes it's best to stay seated. Some bed and breakfasts not only present opportunities to explore and photograph the fall foliage, but also provide breathtaking vistas right from the inn's porch or the privacy of your room's deck and Jacuzzi tub. So, while others are climbing mountainous trails or driving down winding roads, you can sit back, relax and soak in fall's finest hues from the best seat in the house."

When her colleague left the table for the restroom, my friend immediately reached for her smartphone to check texts, email, and her Twitter feed. Then she stopped herself. She put her phone down, lifted her head, and looked around. And she saw something interesting: All of the single people in the restaurant (those sitting alone) were either on their phones, Blackberrys, iPads, or laptops. No one was looking around. Not a single person.It dawned on my friend this is the new normal. No one looks around anymore. No one looks up from their screens. And although they live in a big city -- THE Big Apple, in fact -- the people around her live in the small world of their own screens. They meet no one new. They don't ask for directions on the street and they don't talk to people near them in the coffee shop. They're busy with their time-consuming technologies.My wife and I were talking about this the other day and we realized that no one knows anyone's phone number any more. There are thousands of digits in any given iPhone, but not a single seven-digit number in anyone's head. My mother-in-law doesn't know her own daughters' numbers. I don't know my own sister's. Basically, why memorize something that a cell phone already knows?And although I send hundreds of emails each month, I don't know anyone's real or electronic addresses. I have no idea how to send a letter to any of my five siblings because, address-wise, I don't know where they live. I literally don't.And speaking of location, Nokia did a study four years ago that showed that a quarter of the world's population can't get around their own home towns or cities without GPS units, and the percentage of map-crippled individuals has to be growing. Many people literally don't know where they are or how to get anywhere around them. The art and relationship of map, navigation, and spatial memory is quickly being lost.If using our brains in complicated ways, if memorization and challenging recall help to stave off Alzheimer's and the effects of Parkinson's, why are we allowing for these trade-for-brain technologies in every area of life? Why can college students not use a real dictionary or thesaurus? Why would I use a phone to do simple multiplication? And should we eventually have everything taught to us via 140-character life-lesson-text-messages?What I'm really asking is: How did we get here?
