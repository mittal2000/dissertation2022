For the most part, their lives are vanilla -- pedestrian. Peter's work as a lawyer means that he spends long hours at his firm, while Jenny's day follows a typical soccer mom's schedule. Every day pretty much follows the same routine. After dinner, and once the kids have been put to bed, Jenny and Peter have one-on-one time. They make plans for the weekend, pay bills, watch TV and then go to bed.Enter Jake. Recently divorced, Jake moves into the house next door. Being neighborly, Jenny and Peter go over to introduce themselves. They learn that Jake's two children, who are roughly the same ages as Jenny and Peter's kids, go to the same soccer practice. Jenny offers to help out with driving.An affair evolves.  It begins slowly. When Jake does have time to watch the occasional soccer match, he and Jenny sit together and then take the kids for ice cream. They enjoy each other's company, the conversation flows easily, and chemistry develops. The friendship morphs into a thrilling affair.The attraction is physical and mental. The sex is electric -- it amplifies their magnetic connection.One day, a friend tells Peter he saw Jake and Jenny enter a hotel holding hands. Peter doesn't know what to do, maybe his friend was mistaken. He decides that before making accusations, he'll apply the mantra he uses every day in his legal practice -- innocent until proven guilty. Later that night, when Jenny is in the shower, he looks at Jenny's open computer screen. And there it is: that one incriminating email. It's so intimate and inappropriate that Peter knows without a shadow of a doubt, Jenny is guilty.Peter confronts Jenny and she confesses. Now what? For many like Peter, Jenny's betrayal is an unpardonable wrong. If she was unhappy in the marriage, why not mention it, seek counseling, or ask for a divorce? Unfortunately, Jenny lives a messy life like a lot of people in this world.There are four basic ways this scenario can pan out (or a mixture of one or two).1. Jenny can ask for forgiveness and hope to reconcile. This approach is common. Many people have affairs during a marriage, and some partners will forgive. For this to work, Jenny must cut all ties with Jake. She and Peter might consider moving to start afresh. Jenny's years, history and life with Peter and the kids should count for more than a six-month fling. The question Peter (and Jenny) face is whether they want to mend their broken marriage. It's not easy, but it can be done.   Here's how it would play out: - Jenny must feel regret and endeavor to make amends. - If Peter senses Jenny's sincerity, he may slowly begin to trust her again. - Ideally, Peter will eventually accept Jenny's apology. Resentment is poison. - Peter may begin to see his role in weakening the marriage. - Peter and Jenny start fresh, with renewed commitment and honesty.2. Jenny asks for forgiveness but the marriage ends nonetheless. Jenny or Peter may not want to reconcile. Either way, Jenny can still feel regret and make amends. She can do this by not blaming Peter for the affair and doing whatever she can to be supportive of Peter during the divorce. Jenny needs to protect her rights but not escalate things unnecessarily. She'll have to accept that Peter may not forgive her. Or he may come around, especially if he ends up feeling okay after the divorce. The question: what about Jake?- Jenny may insist on continuing her relationship with Jake. This is not a great idea. It would be wise to wait a long while before seeing him again. Things need to settle down. - Jenny drops Jake realizing that his presence confuses the children and humiliates Peter.3. Peter calls off the marriage and makes no room for discussion.  This is the more severe version of option two. Here, Jenny may feel badly, but Peter won't have it. It's a simple formula: Jenny is a terrible person.  No one would deny Peter's right to be angry, but it may obscure what's really going on. Peter need not forgive, but what if he uses his ""moral"" position to poison the children against their mother? Or, what if he's threatening in public? Under these circumstances, Jenny will need good council and psychotherapy both to protect herself and to not make matters worse. Anger keeps people engaged, even as they break apart.4. Jenny can blame Peter and leave the marriage. In this scenario, Jenny is behaving like a typical narcissist. Narcissists feel entitled to what they want, have zero consideration for consequences, objectify others, and show little remorse. Jenny might justify her deceit and the affair. She may even blame Peter and accuse him of playing the victim. Where narcissists are concerned, it's best to cut your losses and move on.   Most narcissists lack the capacity for regret or remorse; they are too preoccupied with justifying whatever they are doing. Regret is a powerful human experience. It makes us moral beings.Why Regret Is Important: Regret involves introspection and holding yourself accountable. It comes when you learn painful lessons. If Jenny experiences regret, then she'll realize that she not only betrayed Peter, but she betrayed herself as well. Jenny may regret the affair, but she'll also regret not having confronted her marriage problems earlier.Many people have affairs -- a breaking of a sacred trust. But some know what regret is all about. Those people become better souls in the long run. And, sometime the aggrieved party gets it -- and heals."

Problems in the bedroom can lead to deep dissatisfaction. A marital sex problem is like a canary in a coal mine -- a warning alarm that danger lies ahead.,2013-02-02,Dier feet of couple in bed. Separation and divorce,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbc252400005100535098.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Can sex kill a marriage? Absolutely. Problems in the bedroom can lead to deep dissatisfaction. A marital sex problem is like a canary in a coal mine -- a warning alarm that danger lies ahead.Here are 7 ways sex can kill a marriage:1. One spouse controls the frequency of sex: Married couples vary considerably in terms of how much sex they have or don't have. While studies report that married people on average have sex seven times a month, there is no magic formula that couples can follow to ensure a happy sex life. The crucial point is that both partners have to feel good about how much sex they are having and how much control they have over their sex life. If one person takes charge of when and how sex happens, relationship killers like dissatisfaction, resentment and anger can emerge.2. Spouses withhold sex: This can be an insidious problem, particularly if sex is used as a weapon to punish one another. It's particularly toxic if an unresolved grievance from the past is offered up as the reason for the withholding of sex. Once one partner ends up sleeping on the couch instead of the marital bed, the end is probably near. Another insidious problem is using sex as a ""treat"" to reward the partner for good behavior -- a training method that is better suited for household pets!3. The marriage becomes sexless. Marriages where sex never or very rarely occurs is an issue that has gained more attention in recent years. Studies estimate that a whopping 15 percent of married couples have not had sex with their spouse in the last six months to one year. In some cases, this can be an indication that the marriage has died and the couple has decided to stay together for other reasons like money, children or health insurance. In other cases, the marriage may have morphed into a platonic relationship. An sexless marriage becomes a problem if one person is unhappy with the situation and yearns for a sexual connection with a partner. In some marriages, a breakdown in the sexual relationship may be an indicator of deeper problems in the relationship such as lack of trust, intimacy, resentment, anger. One or both people may be suffering from depression. These are issues that can be worked on in therapy, if both people are willing to do the work. A lack of interest in sex can also be a symptom of a medical or aging issue. Some people maintain an active sex drive till the end of their lives. Others lose their drive as they advance in years. The health of a relationship between older partners will be based on whether both are equally content with their sex lives.4. Spouses are too busy or too tired for sex. This issue frequently rears its head when a couple has a busy family life or if one or both partners has a demanding job. Not having time for sex can be a problem if it becomes a way of life and the couple loses their closeness and intimacy. Planning regular date nights is something commonly advised for couples who don't have enough one-on-one time. The downside is that scheduling sex tends to preclude spontaneity. Balancing scheduling with occasional spontaneity might be the best formula for success.5. Spouses have differing attitudes about porn. A lot of people look at porn, including men and women with healthy sex lives. Porn can become a problem if one partner doesn't like the other watching porn, particularly if it's perceived as a replacement for sex with the partner. As with other sexual problems, porn addiction can be an indicator of an emotional disconnect between a couple. If the porn becomes a hidden addiction consumed in private, there may be underlying issues that require help from a professional in addition to compromise between the partners. 6. A spouse dislikes sex with their partner. A surprising number of married people I have talked to speak openly of not enjoying sex with their partners anymore. In some marriages, rediscovering a satisfying sex life can involve communicating what does and doesn't feel good, asking for sexual acts that are not being given, or asking for more variety if it's become too predictable or repetitive. Here's an exercise I recommend: one person is the passive recipient of sexual attention and can ask the other for anything they desire. The person giving expects nothing in return. Next time the roles switch. Through this, partners are able to ask for things they may have a problem vocalizing, and the other person learns a lot about what their partner really enjoys.7. A spouse cheats. This is the most obvious marriage killer. The positive side of cheating is that it can sometimes serve to revive a relationship; it's an opportunity to bring up what is lacking in the relationship and propel a couple into a renewed and better union -- though it's a painful way to get there.Sexual satisfaction in all its forms is a vital part of a healthy marriage -- though of course it's not the whole picture. I once heard a therapist describe a good marriage as being like a three legged stool: one leg is emotional connection, one is mental connection, and the other is sexual connection. If one leg is missing, the stool collapses.Did sex play a part in your marriage floundering? Please take this opportunity to share your story below. Don't hold back!"

The 200- to 300-pound linemen and tackles and defensive ends. Food fuels the body, and when is that more important than before spending three hours tackling, hitting, and running?U.S. News chatted with registered dietitian Mitzi Dulan, who spent eight years as team nutritionist with the Kansas City Chiefs. She weighed in on what NFL players eat, which nutritional issues concern them, and what kind of super meal the Super Bowl might demand.More from U.S. News: Former New England Patriot Matt Light Battles Crohn's Disease Performance Foods: What And When To Eat Before Your Next Workout How To Have A Winning Winter WorkoutWhat do NFL players eat on a day-to-day basis? It can vary a lot, even among the players on one team. You want to make sure that every single meal provides carbs -- ideally from whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Carbs give muscles the energy they need to refuel and recover from a workout. Protein is also important, usually from sources like fish, chicken, lean beef or beans. It helps decrease muscle soreness and gives the players the staying power they need. I also make sure players are eating all the colors of the rainbow in fruits and veggies, since these help minimize the need for time off from sickness by boosting the immune system.You're a big proponent of proper hydration. Why's that? It's really important to stay hydrated all week, and not just think, 'It's Saturday night. I have a game tomorrow, so I better hydrate.' Sometimes on Monday nights, the players go out because they typically have Tuesday off. From an alcohol perspective, they need to make sure they're drinking plenty of water, too, because alcohol can have a dehydrating effect.How about sports drinks? Are they a staple among athletes? I recommend a full-strength Gatorade during workouts, practices, and games. It gives the players some sugar, so they're starting out with energy. If you're only drinking water, you're not getting any calories. Gatorade also provides necessary carbs, and delays fatigue. I've seen Super Bowls where players had to leave the field and get IV fluids at half-time, and it's almost always related to hydration. There's absolutely no reason a player should have to do that. When the weather's cooler, they sometimes think it's not important, but it is. Eating pretzels or another snack that provides a little sodium can also help. You're sweating so much that you don't need to worry about getting too much sodium.What do players eat before hitting the field? It depends on game time. The Chiefs played a lot of noon games, so they'd get up and have a big team breakfast, and then maybe some chicken breast closer to starting time. It's best to eat a big meal three hours before hitting the field. The players certainly want to fuel, and an ideal meal is high in protein, but doesn't have much fat, so it doesn't create any GI [gastrointestinal] issues. You don't want to try something for the very first time on Super Bowl Sunday and have a bad reaction. That's why teams often stick with the very same offerings for the pre-game meal, without switching it up.Does the team eat a big meal together after the game? It depends if they have to hop on an airplane right away. If they're in town and they want to get out of there, they might just leave and go out to dinner with their families. Different teams have different setups.NFL players are often pretty big guys. Do they consume a lot of calories, especially since they're using so much energy? One player may need 6,000 calories a day, while another only needs around 3,000. I worked with each athlete to help him achieve his goal weight. For example, if he didn't have enough energy in his legs, it was probably a carb issue, so we could make the necessary adjustments.Were certain meals or types of food most popular among the players? The Chiefs used to have sushi every Wednesday, and we always ran out really quickly. The players loved smoothies, too, and they also enjoyed Mexican food and Chinese from places like P.F. Chang's.Was there room for dessert? We were providing monster cookies at one point, and the guys loved them. As a dietitian, of course, I wouldn't recommend eating a monster cookie before you're getting ready to head out onto the field.What else does an NFL nutritionist do? What were your sessions with players like? I spent a lot of my time working one-on-one with the players, since their diets varied so much. I've also done team presentations, worked with wives and girlfriends, and taken players grocery shopping. My advice varies depending on whether it's a single player, or a player who's married and has someone cooking for him. I also worked with teams on what types of food to provide.What kind of common questions did you hear from the players? They wanted ideas for simple meals, like what they could make on a grill or how they could make easy smoothies at home. And if they were going out, what were the best options? I've had players text me from the Super Bowl, because they were out to eat and wanted to know if they should order pork, fish, or something else. Some of the guys were trying to lose body fat -- that was probably the most common question -- but sometimes they were trying to gain weight instead.Did you recommend a vitamin or supplement for the players? Yes, I would recommend some supplements. Most commonly: fish oil, a multivitamin with minerals, protein powder and creatine."

In two new studies, researchers from the Oregon Health & Science University have discovered ways in which these sea creatures -- which include clams, squid and snails -- could help us develop better medicines. In the first study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers analyzed the shipworm (which is actually not a worm, but a clam-like mollusk), which are known for sticking onto the wooden parts of ships and using bacteria to turn the wood into something the animals can feed off of and live on. They found that shipworms use a bacteria that actually secrets an antibiotic, which is important because scientists are searching for alternatives to antibiotics used today to which bacteria are increasingly growing resistant. In the second study, published in the journal Chemistry and Biology, OHSU researchers worked with University of Philippines and University of Utah scientists to examine a type of mollusk called the cone snail. They found that cone snails produce a chemical that affects brain nerve cells, which could be promising for future pain medications. ""This discovery tells us that these animals also produce compounds worth studying,"" study researcher Eric Schmidt, Ph.D., who is a biochemist at the University of Utah, said in a statement. ""It's hoped that these studies may also provide us with valuable knowledge that will help us combat disease.""This is not the first time mollusks have been tapped as a potential resource in medicine. In 2011, University of Florida College of Medicine researchers published a study in the journal Nature examining how mollusks developed their nervous systems, brains and shells over time.

Armstrong confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France cycling during the interview that aired Thursday, Jan. 17, reversing more than a decade of denial.

In recent weeks it has turned into mainstream news across the globe. Like many macro-level events there is a lot businesses can learn from it. So much so, the Armstrong Affair has quintessentially been an educational master class for marketers:Lance's Lesson #1: The Player Can Be Bigger than the TeamArmstrong's Actions: Despite being the founder and face of the Livestrong Foundation, Armstrong was asked to leave his organization in fear of the negative effect his association would have.Marketer Learnings: An individual brand you market may have a halo effect over your entire range. As such, these 'power brands' need to be carefully managed in order to avoid them having negative effects over your entire house of brands.Lesson in Action: Coca-Cola launched their bottled water brand, Dasani, in the UK in 2004. However, consumers discovered it was essentially tap water. This led to the brand being removed from the market and drew headlines such as 'the real sting' and was attached to the entire Coca-Cola corporate identity -- not just the brand in question. Lance's Lesson #2: Never Forget 'The Law of Candor'Armstrong's Actions: By taking so long to admit to doping, Armstrong greatly worsened the NET effect of the scandal to himself. Marketer Learnings: Al Ries' classic 'Law of Candor' dictates that confessing to a negative in the first instance may result into a longer term positive.Lesson in Action: Mouthwash brand Listerine admitted their product tasted awful to generate the strap-line ""I hate it but love it."" Following this campaign they overtook Scope as the existing market leader.Lance's Lesson #3: Choose Your Channel CarefullyArmstrong's Actions: Armstrong chose to confess his sins via Oprah Winfrey -- not judge and jury. This invoked outrage that he merely sought to dramatize his confessions as oppose to answering to the authorities.Marketer Learnings: With all the communications portals available to marketers in the modern era, it is vital to select the right one for the right message. It is also worth remembering that different consumers favor different channels -- so your message may need to span over numerous mediums.Lesson in Action: Following the poorly received maps on their iOS 6 application, Apple CEO Tim Cook posted an open letter on Apple's website apologizing for the frustration the maps had caused and offered alternative solutions. In the process Cook showed not only did Apple listen to customers, but that he was an impassioned CEO who was capable of admitting mistakes.Lance's Lesson #4: Reputation is Like a House of CardsArmstrong's Actions: Since 1997 Armstrong built up his reputation as the super athlete who beat cancer to win the Tour de France seven times. This was destroyed within 60 seconds of his 'Oprah interview.'Marketer Learnings: Just because your brand has equity which has been built up over a long period of time, this does not mean its reputation is safe. Reputation can be tarnished in the blink of an eye, often to the point of no return.Lesson in Action: Picture-sharing outlet Instagram -- which in social media terms is middle-aged -- had built up a following of 16 million over two years. However, upon changing its T&C's to state that it could upload consumers' images for advertising purposes, this figure fell by over 50 percent -- to seven million.

The company, which makes orthopedic reconstruction products, is blaming 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices in President Obama's health care law for the layoffs, according to Fox13 News. “The nearly $30 billion tax on medical devices that took effect Jan. 1, 2013, has impacted a number of companies across the U.S.,” the company said in a statement to Fox13 News. Medical companies lobbied to get the tax, which is levied on medical devices implanted by professionals, repealed, according to Reuters. The tax is expected to raise $29 billion in government revenue through 2022.Joe Metzger, the company's senior vice president of corporate communications, told the Memphis Business Journal that the firm is ""not immune from this added expense burden.""Smith & Nephew, which is based in London and has a global reach, employs ""more than 11,000 [people] in 90 countries,"" according to the Washington Times. The company is not the first to blame Obamacare for layoffs and other cuts in spending. In November, The Huffington Post reported that a Georgia man who identified himself as a small business owner said ""he fired some employees and cut hours for others"" because of the president's reelection and his ""Obamacare mandate."" Also in November, Fox News reported that Stryker, a global manufacturer of medical devices and equipment, had announced that it was cutting 1,170 jobs in anticipation of the health care law and the medical device excise tax.

Founder of GoldDerby.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ilincolnis-oscar-quest-it_us_5bb4154de4b066f8d2547847,"In order to win Best Picture,  a movie must conjure up a person who Academy members are rooting for. In other words, the film with the best face behind the title wins.",2013-02-02,"HOLLYWOOD, CA - NOVEMBER 08: Director/producer Steven Spielberg arrives at the 'Lincoln' premiere during AFI Fest 2012 presented by Audi at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on November 8, 2012 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images For AFI)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4154d2000009900005987.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Years ago Variety editor Peter Bart shared with me a fascinating Oscar insight. In order to win Best Picture, he said, a movie must conjure up a person who Academy members are rooting for. In other words, the film with the best face behind the title wins. Thus The Departed (2006) and The Hurt Locker (2009) won because voters wanted to give hugs to Marty Scorsese and Kathryn Bigelow. This year, according to that theory, Argo may be surging ahead because Hollywood is cheering on poor Oscar-snubbed Ben Affleck, who, after years in the industry's trenches, has finally emerged as a major filmmaker.But what about Lincoln? Who comes immediately to mind when voters think about the movie that leads this derby with the most nominations? Maybe Daniel Day-Lewis? Maybe Steven Spielberg? The correct answer should really be Spielberg -- it's his story and it's not properly reverberating across Oscarland. Think about what the dramatic success of Lincoln means: It represents the spectacular career comeback of a man who reigns as king of Hollywood filmmakers. Imagine this poster plastering the billboards and bus stops along Sunset Blvd. (if only DreamWorks/Disney had the guts to post them): ""Spielberg's baaaaack! Lincoln = $170 million box office! 'Masterpiece' (NY Times) ... Most Academy Award Nominations! Now ... let's give Steven that overdue Best Picture Oscar.""While the King of Hollywood Filmmakers has won two Academy Awards for Best Director (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), he's only snagged Best Picture once (Schindler's List). That's criminal when you compare him to other directors whose movies have reaped Best Picture twice: Milos Forman (Amadeus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and Clint Eastwood (Million Dollar Baby, Unforgiven).Crucial to the Peter Bart Oscar Best Picture Theory is that the person behind the film title should be engaged in a compelling quest. Think Marty Scorsese being criminally overdue to win. Or Kathryn Bigelow representing the face of all womanhood being shockingly snubbed, too. In Bigelow's case, it helped that she even had a nifty second quest: revenge against her ego-mad ex-husband James Cameron, who competed against her little indie The Hurt Locker with his monster megahit Avatar.Spielberg has two quests too: his overdue second Best Picture award and a chunk of Academy gold needed to hail his big career comeback, but these quests aren't being trumpeted across Hollywood by his studio because, frankly... they're embarrassing. Take the comeback angle, for example. It's not like Spielberg is recovering from a big career crash. It's just that he hasn't had such spectacular critical/commercial/awards success as Lincoln since Schindler's List (1993). War Horse was a disappointment when compared to early expectations, but it still got nominated for Best Picture last year (Spielberg got snubbed in the directors' lineup). His previous serious film was Munich (2005) which got nommed for five Oscars, including Best Picture and Director (it lost to Crash and he lost the helmer's laurels to Brokeback Mountain's Ang Lee).But, wait -- maybe then the Lincoln story, the Lincoln quest, the person we should think of behind the title of that film isn't really Spielberg at all. Maybe it should really be his producing partner Kathleen Kennedy, who is holding a giant Oscar I.O.U. She's lost Best Picture six times: War Horse (2011), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), Munich (2005), Seabiscuit (2003), The Sixth Sense (1999), The Color Purple (1995), and E.T. (1982).Now THAT's a worthy quest -- and one involving a deserving female no less. So maybe we should rip up those Spielberg posters dreamt up for Sunset Blvd. and reimagine them as Kennedy ones, saying, ""Ask not what the Oscars can do for you .... Ask what you can do to get Kennedy her elusive Oscar!""See the latest predictions of 25 top Oscar experts in the races for Best Picture and Best Director.

Lionsgate has supplied the clues in the prodigious print ad buy in major metropolitan areas. Take a look at some of the blurb copy they ran. ""Action-Packed, Suspenseful and Fun!,"" ""Classic Schwartznegger!,"" ""Johnny Knox is Hilarious!, and ""A Total Blast!"" Please note the exclamation points to ensure we know it's all TRUE!!!So who are these major media outlets roaring out this hyper-praise for The Last Stand? They are Terra.com, Artistdirect.com, Joblo.com and Fox-TV -- presumably the entire network -- but not quite. Turns out FOX-TV is specifically Shawn Edwards from Fox 4 News, Kansas City, MO., who has amassed more than 300 print quotes since he started reviewing. Mr. Edwards is a swell fellow, no doubt. But when you're Lionsgate spending uber-bucks on a national ad buy, is Shawn Edwards, Fox-4 News, Kansas City, your first choice for a quote?How about Terra.com? They are a South American website. No hint of exactly who in South America thinks The Last Stand is ""Action-Packed, Suspenseful and Fun!"" Presumably the entire continent.""Classic Schwartzenegger!"" is from ArtistsDirect.com, an online digital media, music retailer and distribution company out of Santa Monica, Calif. Ever heard of them? No? Again, no clue as to a quotable source at ArtistsDirect.com or what their connection might be to Lionsgate.Then there's JoBlo.com who wants us to know that ""Johnny Knox is Hilarious!"" As a web-based movie fan site, they're certainly in the know.You've got to feel for the marketing department at Lionsgate. What a pickle. You know you've got a stinker on your hands but you've got to come up with something. So you turn to the web for it's infinite source of opinions. At least they're being honest about it -- using actual, albeit obscure, quote sources. Back in 1961 legendary Broadway theater producer David Merrick also had a dud on his hands which was slammed by all seven New York critics. So Merrick took full page ads out with raving quotes from these very same critics. Only they weren't. They were ordinary mojos pulled from the phone book with the same names as the critics, treated to a Broadway musical and graciously quoted in all ads to wit: ""7 Out of 7 Are Ecstatically Unanimous About 'Subways Are For Sleeping'!""Chances are most of us have never heard of any of the sites that raved about The Last Stand -- and does it really matter? The Internet revolution has greatly expanded our opinion sources. They're anywhere and everywhere, vigorously expressed through blast emails, tests and tweets and now in expensive ad copy for movies. The problem is when you're everywhere, you tend to be nowhere. And truth is hard to find when anything could be the truth.And I am mediaprep.com."

AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1319c240000500096b25f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Obama owns a coal-fired power plant. A big one.  Okay, not Mr. Obama personally. But the federal government is indeed the largest owner of the biggest coal power plant in the West: 2,250-megawatt Navajo Generating Station near the Grand Canyon on the Navajo reservation in northern Arizona.  In his inaugural address pledge to respond to the threat of devastating climate change, the president said that America must lead the transition toward sustainable energy sources. Promising news for our children, but what are the specifics?  Many have pointed to the upcoming decision on the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. But similarly telling will be the role the Administration plays in decisions that loom on Navajo Generating Station.  There are coal plants all over the country, but this one's different. The U.S. government co-owns the plant in order to provide electricity for canal pumps that carry Colorado River water uphill over 300 miles from western Arizona to the central and southern parts of the state.  Navajo Generating Station dates back nearly 40 years, to when I was a child attending a Navajo reservation boarding school in Shonto, about an hour drive from the coal plant. I remember being picked up on Fridays after school and driving with my family to Page to load up on groceries before heading home. The scenery on those drives always struck me: the red tones of the land and the high sandstone mesas meeting a huge dome of blue sky. It's an area admired by photographers worldwide.  On those car rides, I also remember seeing the bright lights of Navajo Generating Station and Peabody's coal mining operations. I wondered why they had lights and we didn't, or if this would mean our lands would look like a big city one day. At that time most homesteads on the reservation, like my grandmother's, didn't have electricity or running water.  Today, decades later, there is much that remains the same. The coal plant and mine are still going, and many Navajo homes in the area still lack electricity and running water.  But times, and views, have also changed. Communities in the area today are deeply concerned about water. Navajo Generating Station has used about 34,000 acre-feet of water every year and mining operations on Black Mesa have depleted ancient fossil groundwater aquifers that cannot be replenished.  People are concerned about health. Navajo Generating Station has been among the worst in the nation in emissions of nitrogen oxide pollution, which reacts in the atmosphere to form fine particulate pollution, one of the most dangerous air pollutants.  With super storms and drought, Navajo Generating Station's smokestacks now gain notoriety as Arizona's single biggest source of climate-warming carbon pollution. Today, area residents who try to make a living from ranching, farming, weaving or other activities that require plentiful water and a healthy environment worry for their future.  That's the backdrop for decisions that loom this year about Navajo Generating Station, decisions that in part fall at the feet of the Obama Administration. Should resources be poured into installing modern pollution controls for the aging plant, as is necessary under the Clean Air Act to prolong its operation? Or, after nearly 40 years, is it time for progress toward a different economic future on the Navajo reservation, to map a transition to power, jobs, and revenue from the clean energy so readily available from the constant sun on our land?  The heads of three federal agencies -- Interior, Energy, and EPA -- have announced that they'll work together on the matter of Navajo Generating Station. But their aims have been vague. Will they carry out President Obama's inaugural mission to claim the promise of clean energy sources, to maintain our economic vitality and preserve our planet?  Corporations such as Peabody, the multinational coal mining company that supplies Navajo Generating Station, certainly won't stand quietly on the sidelines. Mr. Obama acknowledged in his speech that the path towards sustainable energy will be sometimes difficult. This coal plant near the rim of the Grand Canyon will be a test of his resolve, a second-term energy bellwether to watch."
