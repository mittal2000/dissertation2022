Square shot.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d744e2200003000d9a3a1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," By Cynthia Sass, MPH, RDJust when I think I've seen it all, another quick fix weight-loss method pops up. Over the years I've heard about weight-loss lollipops, diet chopsticks, even slimming sunglasses (designed to change the color of food and make it unappetizing). There will always be silly and trendy get-slim-quick tricks, but what really worries me are approaches that are invasive, extreme, and downright dangerous. Here are seven I hope you'll never, ever try:More From Health.com Kick Back With Ali Larter 5 Hottest Fitness Trends of 2013 (So Far) A 30-Minute, Total-Body Running WorkoutPlastic Tongue Patch Created by a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, this yet-to-be FDA-approved patch is sewn onto the tongue with six stitches in about 10 minutes, at a cost of roughly $2,000. The device and sutures make eating solid food so excruciatingly painful, patch wearers are forced to adhere to a liquid-only diet, which supplies about 800 calories a day.Tube Feeding When I first heard about this trend, I was speechless. To lose weight quickly, women, including many brides-to-be, are opting to have a feeding tube inserted through their noses, which travels through the esophagus into the stomach, remaining in place 24 hours a day. For 10 days, eating is avoided completely, and a high protein, low carb formula is fed through the tube, delivering roughly 800 daily calories. The medical procedure, which costs about $1,500, is normally used to nourish people who cannot eat due to illness or injury.Drunkorexia Drunkorexia is a relatively new term for the overlap of binge drinking and disordered eating. The pattern can involve behaviors like: restricting calories to “save them up” for alcohol; drinking excessively to the point of throwing up as a way to purge; overexercising before drinking or the following day; or starving the day after a night of binge drinking. The potential side effects of combining alcohol with undereating and/or purging are serious, including trouble concentrating, and difficulty making decisions, in addition to a weakened immune system, and a greater risk of injuries and acute alcohol poisoning. This is a trend I've noticed not just in college students, but also among women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.Tapeworms While possessing tapeworms is illegal in the U.S., I regularly hear about people seeking them out for weight loss. The sad reality is that many people who unintentionally become infected with tapeworms in the United States suffer from serious dangers, including digestive blockages, organ function disruption, brain and nervous system damage, and even death.Starvation Your body is like an engine that's always turned on -- from head to toe, every cell needs a constant source of fuel to perform its job. In addition, your structure is in a continual state of repair, healing, and regeneration, so your cells need a steady supply of “building blocks,” including protein and healthy fats, to maintain your tissues. When needed fuel and essential raw materials don't show up for work, or you consume less than your body requires to support a healthy weight, the deficits trigger a cascade of side effects. Even semi-starvation (less than about 1,000-1,200 calories per day for most women, depending on height and frame size, or more if you're active) can lead to fatigue, depression, the breakdown of muscle, organ and bone tissue, suppressed immunity, hair loss, hormone imbalances, sleep disturbances, and an increased injury risk.Smoking I wish this wasn't the case, but I have had clients tell me they took up smoking specifically to lose weight, fully knowing the unhealthy consequences. It is true that smoking dulls taste buds, suppresses appetite, and slightly increases metabolism. But the health risks are so great that experts estimate they're equal to gaining 100 pounds (not to mention the impact on aging your skin).Stimulants Throughout my years specializing in weight loss and disordered eating, I've seen many women and men fall into the trap of using stimulant drugs to lose weight, then becoming addicted, and ending up in rehab, or worse. And even without dependence, over-the-counter, prescription, or illegal stimulants are risky, with potential side effects ranging from poor judgment, impulsivity and mood swings, to dangerously high blood pressure, seizures, and stroke.Bottom line: In our weight-obsessed culture, it's easy to understand the temptation to gamble on a quick fix, but no loss of inches and pounds is worth risking your health. And while it may take a little more time and patience, clean eating and exercise do work -- while also keeping you safe and healthy. Remember, YOU are more important than the number on a scale.7 Crazy Weight-Loss Methods You Should Never Try originally appeared on Health.com"

Chuck (Hughes), the über cutie from The Cooking Channel's Chuck Eats The Street has a delicious relationship with food, as is evident by Montreal hot-spots Garde Manger and Le Bremner, where he's both owner and chef. His uninhibited demeanor makes for great conversation, great parties and most importantly, his ability to create truly inspired dishes. Joshua Estrin: You always appear to be having so much fun -- What is your philosophy when real life and the kitchen collide?Chuck Hughes:  Life in the kitchen is not so different than any other part of life and that being said it offers the chance to learn a great deal. I have been cooking for most of my life and the rules of the kitchen seem to apply quite nicely:1. In the kitchen like in life you can't skip steps without risking disaster. 2. If you rush the process things simply won't turn out as expected. 3. You might think you can fake it, but somehow, someone always figures it out.JE: Do you think most guys realize that men who cook are what some would call chick magnets?CH: I have been taking cooking classes all my life and yes some of my buddies would give me some static about it. I would laugh it off for many reasons. First off, I don't roll well with stereotypes and I accept everyone for who they are. As for cooking making guys more attractive... All I know is each time I walked into a cooking class it was me and a room full of ladies... I always liked that ratio.JE: Tell me about your latest project.CH: I have a great life and the best job in the world and I try to remember to say that out loud every day so as to never take it for granted. Chuck Eats The Street is a great show that lets everyone (self included) get a taste of our amazing country through the food that fills the plates of some remarkable people who are simply living life and cooking the only way they know how -- with love and authenticity. From crepes to Frito Pie I am living the life one calorie at a time and I admit it, I have the best job in the world.JE: Tell me a little bit more about all those tattoos. Do you think some people judge your book by its' cover?CH: Oh absolutely, I have certainly gotten my fair share of looks and I know some people still have very strong opinions about body art.

Maybe it's a dreamy Jeffersonian desire to return to the land in the midst of the digital revolution, driven by nostalgic hipsters and modern homesteaders. Maybe we, as Americans, are just fed up with the way we've been cooking and eating (Credit: Kodua Galieti).Whatever the reasoning is, many Americans are exchanging packaged, factory-produced, and fast food for something a little slower and a little more hands-on. As Pollan wrote in a 2012 New York Times article, ""In the last couple of decades, a new economy of farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture (also known as farm shares) and sustainable farming has changed the way millions of Americans eat and think about food. People by the millions have begun, as the slogan goes, to vote with their forks in favor of more sustainably and humanely produced food, and against agribusiness."" Cooking from scratch is on the rise; many individuals are becoming truly interested in where their food is coming from and what, exactly, they're putting into their bodies.Click here to see All 8 Food Classes That Will Change Your Life (and 32 Amazing Runners-Up)As a result of a long couple of decades of packaged food, many writers -- especially food scientists, anthropologists, and some chefs, like Jaime Oliver, who champions the so-called ""food revolution"" and has found that many American schoolchildren can't correctly identify fresh food -- argue that we've become disconnected from the food that we eat, and many of us find, in practice, that this is true: we are daunted by the prospect of what it means to feed ourselves from scratch; we simply don't know how to do it.Luckily, not all of us have forgotten how to cook from scratch -- how to bake bread, prepare a cut of meat, and preserve the garden's best. Across the country, individuals with know-how and an intense zeal for ""real"" food are excited about sharing their knowledge with those interested. Many of these individuals, like Camas Davis of the Portland Meat Collective and Ricki Carroll of the New England Cheesemaking Supply Company, couldn't find resources here in the United States when they became interested in learning how to, say, butcher a pig or make cheese at home. But thanks to their determination in seeking out experts internationally, educational opportunities now exist across the U.S.: Food classes, led by these passionate people, have cropped up with the intent of helping us eat better food and enjoy our food -- and the process of making it -- more.RELATED: 15 Celebrities' Fast-Food FavoritesHome cooks, rejoice: you can now take a class to learn how to do just about anything in the kitchen, from raising bees to jarring the honey they produce to using that honey as a sweetener in a loaf of bread.We researched the country's best offerings to find the following 40 hands-on food classes. These are all classes for home cooks, not trained professionals. They were chosen based on the thoroughness of the education and the relative cost of the program, as well as the mission and focus of the organization and how widely the organization reaches.RELATED: 25 Great After-School Snack IdeasOne class in each of the eight categories (beekeeping, bread-baking, butchering, coffee-making, cheesemaking, food preservation, foraging, and homebrewing) was chosen as the best based on these criteria -- but we also know that there's a good chance that a home cook in Rhode Island isn't going to plan a trip to Oregon for a class on butchering, no matter how good the class might be. So in addition to the one class we've deemed best, we're including similar classes in other regions of the country. Still too far to trek? Not to worry: we found the best online guides, too.Each of the instructors we talked to seemed to stress that the skills they teach aren't just for master chefs or experts: anyone can learn to keep bees, or butcher their own meat, or brew the perfect beer or cup of coffee. The classes they teach may not make you an expert, but they will leave you with the knowledge you need to get started. As they say, knowledge is power, and we think these classes have the power to change your life -- not to mention the way you eat.- Caroline Lange, The Daily MealMore from The Daily Meal: 16 Inspiring Celebrity Kitchens 9 Wedding Cakes That Take a Cue From the Big Screen America's Most Beautiful Kitchens 16 Outrageous Celebrity Wedding Cakes"

It's a trip.A vacation is for sipping drinks at 10 a.m. and taking those obnoxious pictures of the lower half of your legs while looking out onto palm trees. A vacation is for getting massages and eating nachos and overusing phrases like ""beer-thirty."" A vacation is for pools and sun and servants, lots and lots of servants.Trips are just like that, except for everything.We just spent a week at the cabin with Mary's siblings, spouses and their kids. That's six adults and seven kids ages 13 and under.There were some magical moments, like each time we crawled into bed at night, and the unexpected seven-minute nap on Thursday. And the time the log jumped out of the fire and almost landed on the 7-year-old. Or the thousand times that the 4-year-old used the red and white plastic boat to mercilessly bludgeon his cousins. Or the time(s) the 10-year-old locked herself in her room and texted her demands. Or when our three boys threw a box of tampons in the toilet. Or every meal.Perhaps my favorite was when the other 4-year-old punched me in the head while simultaneously kicking me in the wedding tackle, simply because we wouldn't let him ride back from the beach in ""Adam and Susie's van.""By far the best moment every day was when the kids were finally in bed, and the adults all gathered upstairs to laugh, moan about our sore, aging bodies, and relive every precious part of that day. Our defenses lowered, the smiles came out, and we did our best to stay awake until 10 p.m.. These moments fooled us; they started to feel like vacation.And then it happened.""Dad.""The 6-year-old had somehow broken out of his basement prison and was now standing in the middle of vacation.""Um, what are you doing out of your room?"" My question was curt and demanding, devoid of any fatherly kindness or compassion.""Ligey crawled into Ben's bed and started punching him, and now Ben is really crying.""That would never happen on vacation. But on a trip, it's on the printed out daily agenda that your kids give you upon arrival.So I took the 6-year-old back down into his basement prison/bedroom, and began asking questions.""Ligey, did you crawl into Ben's bed and beat him senseless?""""No, Isaac did.""""I did not! I did not!""After my riveting lecture on how we don't use our hands for hitting, I decided I needed to lay the smack down, but my mouth moved faster than my mind.""Guys,"" I barked, ""if any one of you gets out of your bed for anything other than going to the bathroom, then... there is going to be a terrible consequence.""""What consequence, dad?"" The 6-year-old adroitly wondered.But I didn't have a consequence. Damn you, Love and Logic, you always make so much sense when the kids are nowhere in sight. Don't think I can't feel you shaking your head at me, shaming me with your quiver full of appropriate consequences. But I say consequences are hard to come by after you have been kidnapped from vacation and transported back into trip hell.""Something really, really, bad"" is what I actually said, as I walked out of their room, shutting the door a little too firmly.On the way home, both 4-year-olds fell asleep, but woke up about an hour into the trip because I broke the cardinal rule of road trips when your children are asleep: I stopped for gas. For a while, I wondered how bad it would be to simply run out of gas and sleep by the side of the road until the police tapped on the window with their oversized flashlights. But Mary wasn't into that, so we stopped.4-year-old number one immediately launched into a blood-curdling scream, as if someone was jabbing his kidneys with a sharp metal object. The other one quickly joined, and our minivan became a concert of ugly. When combined with our razor-thin patience, we feared that someone might be going home in a body bag.I took a long time filling up that minivan before I got back in. The sun may have set and risen again. But after we started rolling, and the screaming intensified, the first really magical thing of the whole trip happened: I actually started laughing. I looked over at Mary, my wife of 17 years and the most amazing person on planet earth, and she was laughing, too. Suddenly the whole week felt hilarious, and we remembered that we loved each other and we loved our kids and we loved our life.We turned on some music to drown out the crazies in the back, and said a silent prayer of thanks for our life (not really, but refraining from losing it at your screaming kids while on road trips counts as prayer). There will be seasons for vacations, sometime in the future. But the season in which we live right now involves trips. And we will take more of them, to God be the glory, great things he has done.So, let's raise a glass to ourselves, you brave warriors who made it through another summer trip with your young ones without eating them. You did it!Stay classy, parents of small children. In it together.This post originally appeared on The Actual PastorAlso on HuffPost:"

Convenience is a factor, for sure. Hunger, of course, is another. And then there's always the consideration of what's cheap. But now, researchers have shown that Twitter, of all things, can be a useful tool in helping us understand the relationship between eating behaviors and reasons for eating. University of Arizona researchers asked 50 study participants, between ages 18 and 30, to tweet everything that they ate for three days, along with a hashtag to indicate the type of food they were eating and why they were eating it. (For instance: ""Cheeseburger between classes at the Student Union #protein #convenience."")By doing this, researchers were able to make a visual representation of all the foods the study participants were eating, in the context of why they were eating them. This ""allowed us to really see that there are, in fact, relationships, and those relationships do seem to align with the ones in the literature, which shows that convenience and cost are among the main motivators"" for consuming food, study researcher Melanie Hingle, an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the university, said in a statement. ""It's good to raise awareness about your habits since a lot of eating behavior is unconscious or really habitual,"" Hingle added. ""You tend to get in your groove and not get out of it, so this kind of shakes that up and makes you think about what's influencing you. It can help you develop new habits or just become aware of the ones that are not doing you any good.""The study is published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research.Our eating habits aren't the only things Twitter can shed some light on.
