0,BLACK VOICES,Jay-Z and the Misappropriation of Fatherhood,"Michael W. Waters, Contributor

(Photo by Paul Zimmerman/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bade80b250000320037a893.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On, July 4, 2013, cultural iconoclast Jay-Z released his highly anticipated 12th studio album, Magna Carta Holy Grail. Once again pushing past music business boundaries, Jay-Z sold a million copies of the album before its official release. An exclusive deal with Samsung handsomely paid the rapper $25 million dollars and provided free downloads of the album to Samsung users.  A listen to the album reveals several intriguing themes. There is dismissal and re-appropriation of historical figures (in Oceans, ""I'm anti Santa Maria/ Only Christopher we acknowledge/ is Wallace), counterclaims against claims of Illuminati association, and even the decline and re-appropriation of prophetic ministry (in Heaven, ""Tell the preacher he's a preacher/ I'm a f****** prophet). However, most intriguing for me are Jay-Z's reflections on fatherhood.  On July 4th, Blue Ivy Carter, Jay-Z's daughter, was just days short of turning 18 months. Throughout the album, Jay-Z references his daughter, from the bombastic (in Holy Grail, ""Blue told me to remind you n*****... I'm the n*****) to considerations of what will accompany her sizable inheritance (in Picasso Baby, ""Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner/ Go ahead lean on that...Blue/ You own it). Yet, Jay-Z's most powerful Blue references expose his deep feelings of inadequacy as a father.  Jay-Z rightly notes that fatherhood can be a joyful and frightful experience, especially for a rising generation of fathers whose fathers were largely absent. In a video marketing the album, Jay-Z discusses such joyful and frightful aspects with the great Rick Rubin. At first, Jay-Z joyfully acknowledges that Blue is ""Something that [he and wife and iconoclast in her own right, Beyoncé] both created. We still marvel at her."" Then suddenly, Jay-Z bemoans the fact of his own father's abandonment stating that his father never taught him how to be a man, how to raise a child, or how to treat a woman, each lessons Jay-Z freely acknowledges that he desperately needs right now. Jay-Z offers as a summary statement; ""It's the paranoia of not being a great dad."" Jay-Z's paranoia is real and should not be dismissed. With lyrics from Jay-Z Blue, another of Magna Carta's offerings, ""Father never taught me how to be a father"" and ""I don't want to duplicate it/I seen my mom and pop drive each other...crazy/And I got that n**** blood in me/ I got his ego and his temper/ All is missing is the drugs in me""), it is clear that Jay-Z remains haunted by his father's failures and the dissolution of his parent's troubled marriage. I, like many young fathers today, largely the products of absent fathers and failed marriages, can identify with Jay-Z's joy and pain. Upon holding each of my children for the first time, I vividly recall becoming the embodiment of complex dualities -- strength and weakness, assurance and fear, confidence and self-doubt -- each encompassing my being simultaneously.  Jay-Z's most recent offering appears more theological in its subject matter than previous offerings. This comes as no surprise to me. There is nothing like fatherhood to make you more intimately aware of the presence of God. I have often claimed that the day my children were born was the day I truly met God. Childbirth has a way of introducing parents to God in ways more intimate and true than experienced before. In grasping each child's tiny hands, I was able to declare with clearer understanding than before, ""Wonderful are your works"" (Psalm 139:14, NRSV)! Nevertheless, despite these greater revelations of God and Scripture, feelings of inadequacy would still remain at times. In fact, my son's fourth birthday weighed heavily upon me. It was upon that birthday that I recognized that our four short years together had exceeded the entirety of my experience growing up with my own father. And I, too, began to question whether or not I had what it took to be a great dad. Here my own paranoia threatened to set in. There is a clear and present danger for the emotions that Jay-Z, I, and many young fathers' share, especially if unaddressed with the help of a trained counselor. These emotions can cause you to overcompensate for what you lacked in a father and to subject yourself to the self-imposed pressure and unattainable feat of being the perfect father. Too many fathers have been guilty of misappropriating fatherhood as perfection. I have often wondered if the inability to live up to misappropriated perfections has caused generations of men to walk away from their families all together.  Thankfully, in the face of fears and feelings of paternal inadequacy, Jay-Z acknowledges his frailty by rapping on Jay-Z Blue, ""...I know I'm not perfect baby."" This revelation comes as a gift to us all, for in it we can find the liberation to be the best fathers that we can be without being haunted by the past or fearful of the future. It is the revelation that our greatest ambition as fathers is not perfection, but being a loving, faithful, and consistent presence in our children's lives. For it is exceedingly more important for our children to know that we, as fathers, love them, and that we are present for them, than for them to misguidedly cling to the farce of unattainable paternal perfection, a farce that we as fathers have too often erected for ourselves. Once liberated to pursue faithfulness over perfection, prayerfully, a new generation of fathers will find an independence day of our own, free from the past, and inspired by the hope of a greater future."

Launched by Geeks OUT, ""Skip Ender's Game"" asks LGBT rights supports to ""keep your money out of Orson Scott Card’s pockets"" by opting out of seeing ""Ender's Game"" in theaters when the film is released in cinemas on Nov. 1. The group is organizing a series of ""Skip Ender's Game"" events in New York, Orlando, Seattle and other major U.S. cities to coincide with the movie's debut. ""By pledging to Skip Ender’s Game, we can send a clear and serious message to Card and those that do business with his brand of anti-gay activism -- whatever he’s selling, we’re not buying,"" Geeks OUT officials write. ""The queer geek community will not subsidize his fear-mongering and religious bullying.

In March , illustrator Chris Sprouse reportedly dropped out of an upcoming ""Adventures of Superman"" issue written by Card and Aaron Johnston amid media criticism of Card's anti-gay views. ""The media surrounding this story reached the point where it took away from the actual work, and that's something I wasn't comfortable with,"" he explained in a statement cited by USA Today. In 2009, Card joined the board of directors at the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), a group which has actively opposed same-sex marriage. The Hollywood Reporter also cites a 2009 Mormon Times opinion piece penned by Card, in which he argued, “Marriage has only one definition, and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy. I will act to destroy that government and bring it down."" In 2012, he referred to same-sex attraction as a “reproductive dysfunction” in a Rhinoceros Times opinion piece supporting North Carolina's Amendment One. ""Normalizing a dysfunction will only make ours into a society that corrodes any loyalty to it, as parents see that our laws and institutions now work against the reproductive success (not to mention happiness) of the next generation,"" he wrote.

2,QUEER VOICES,Argle-Bargle: What Justice Scalia Still Doesn't Get About Marriage,"Jay Michaelson, Contributor

Vitriolic, hyperbolic, littered with witty bon mots and invective against faulty reasoning (i.e. any reasoning with which Justice Scalia does not agree), it is something one now comes to expect in any high-profile Supreme Court case decided in a more liberal direction. But Justice Scalia's dissent in U.S. v. Windsor, the Defense of Marriage Act case, feels different. Scalia pulled out the same rhetorical flourishes as ever, but he seems remarkably oblivious to context: the lives of millions of Americans. Windsor was not another case about crèches in the public square (the occasion of some of the earliest Scalia rants) or obscure administrative procedures. It was the case that decided the fates of tens of thousands of families, and, more broadly, established that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is wrong, regardless of one's personal views on the subject. Agree or disagree that same-sex families are marriages or not -- they certainly are families, and certainly are made up of human beings. Justice Scalia's contemptuous dissent is contemptuous of these millions of Americans' humanity. The majority's opinion in Windsor was clear enough, and exactly what most legal experts had expected. After dispensing with the issue of standing, the majority noted that marriage is a matter of state, not federal, regulation. Thus a couple married in New York is duly married, whether same-sex or opposite-sex. To discriminate against a married couple requires a secular interest which was lacking in the Defense of Marriage Act -- on the contrary, the legislative record showed evidence of bias. Thus, such discrimination violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws. This reasoning is what Justice Scalia termed ""legalistic argle-bargle.""  Really? Argle-bargle? The term doesn't appear in my dictionary, but I take it to mean an incoherent ramble, the equivalent of gibberish. And to apply it to the legal arguments that a generation of lawyers and legal scholars have debated for years is, itself, offensive. It is offensive to those lawyers, of course, but even more so to people like Edie Windsor, the 84-year-old plaintiff in the case, suing to not be penalized that her legal spouse was a woman and not a man. It is offensive to my friend who can now apply for a Green Card, finally, after living apart from his husband for a year. Context matters, a Scalia Rant in this context is deeply offensive. Of course, no one expected Justice Scalia to strike down DOMA. Yet ironically, the reason we all knew this is that, over the years, Justice Scalia has shown himself to be a duplicitous legal reasoner when his legal ideology meets his political or religious ones. That is, he argle-bargles. For example, for years Scalia waved the banner of state's rights -- until Bush v. Gore, in which he suddenly voted to overturn a state supreme court's interpretation of its own constitution. Indeed, just one day before Scalia's impassioned defense of deference to Congress in Windsor, he voted to overrule Congress in Shelby County, the Voting Rights Act case. So what is the principle here? We defer to Congress when it discriminates, but not when it bars discrimination? Is there a principle? Or is there, rather, just argle-bargle? We also know Scalia is bargling in Windsor because of his many extra-judicial comments about what was at issue in the case. Shockingly defiant of the principle that justices not comment on cases before the Court, Scalia said only a few days before the decision was handed down that the case, like Lawrence v. Texas, was about ""consensual sodomy."" Sodomy - an act. Not sexual orientation, not what millions of people are telling us about their lives; not friends and neighbors and family members - but a sexual act. As if opposite-sex marriage is about cunnilingus. Ironically, this clear contempt for and ignorance of LGBT lives is precisely the sort of animus Justice Scalia says we should not impute to DOMA's backers. In the same words with which he complains of being called a bigot, he writes like a bigot. The ignorance of the lives of gay and lesbian people is not unique to Justice Scalia, of course. Others, too, cover up their ears when they hear about lesbian ministers, or gay boy scouts. No, they insist, there are no gay people -- only gay acts, only sodomy, only a ""lifestyle.""  But this is ignorance of the facts. The facts are that gay people exist, that many (though not all) say they were 'born that way,' that same-sex families are families. And while such ignorance may be expected among the extremist rabble, it ought to have no place in the Supreme Court.  Indeed, even if Justice Scalia still denies the humanity of gay people, one might've hoped that he would have recognized the gravity of the moment and of his role as a Supreme Court justice, and held back from ranting, just this once. But instead, by demeaning the people whose lives were at stake, by dismissing with an invented slur the articulation of their hopes and aspirations, their very sense of what it means to be an American, Justice Scalia has demeaned the institution he is meant to serve. As for the LGBT community, we will not be brought down to his low state. At a rally in New York's Tompkins Square Park, a beloved artist and performer named Donald Gallagher -- a man who was present at Stonewall, who recently lost his partner of 40 years to cancer, and who once laboriously painted the entire ceiling of his church in Jersey City -- proclaimed that, in the secret language of the ancient gay elders, ""Argle Bargle"" really means ""Joy to All."" Argle Bargle! the crowd shouted. Argle Bargle! I couldn't agree more."

FUNDINGAbout 3.6 million people work in Bangladesh's clothing sector, making it the world's second-largest apparel exporter behind China. The industry employs mostly women, some of whom earn as little as $38 a month.Bangladesh has pledged to improve safety, but it has not pledged new money to relocate dangerous buildings.""Brand signatories are responsible to ensure that sufficient funds are available to pay for renovations and other safety improvements,"" Monday's report said.Tesco, the world's third-largest retailer and one of the accord signatories, last month said that it has stopped sourcing clothes from a Bangladesh site because of safety concerns.North American retailers and trade associations are believed to be putting the finishing touches on their own Bangladesh safety agreement. Jason Grumet, president of the Washington think-tank helping to coordinate the effort, last month said the process was on track to be completed in July.European, Bangladeshi and U.S. officials will meet in Geneva on Monday for talks aimed at improving safety conditions and discussing the country's trade benefits, which the EU has threatened to suspend.Tax concessions offered by Western countries and the low wages paid by the manufacturers have helped to turn Bangladesh's garment exports into a $19 billion a year industry, with 60 percent of clothes going to Europe.In late June, U.S. President Barack Obama cut off U.S. trade benefits for Bangladesh in a mostly symbolic response to conditions in the country's garment sector, given that clothing is not eligible for U.S. duty cuts.

The crisis has laid bare structural shortcomings. As such, they require structural solutions.""Weidmann, widely recognised to be the most hawkish member of the ECB's 23-man Governing Council, does not want the bank to intervene too strongly in tackling the bloc's economic crisis, thereby allowing governments to soft-pedal reforms.He spoke a day after fellow ECB policymakers Christian Noyer and Benoit Coeure said the bank's decision to abandon its customary insistence that it never precommits on policy was a change in communication but meant no change from its strategy, which is based on monitoring inflation, real economy and monetary developments.""The euro zone is on the mend, it must be at peace, protected, be allowed to heal,"" Coeure told the same conference on Sunday to explain the ECB's decision to issue such forward guidance, while urging governments to tackle structural problems.The EU's top economic official, Olli Rehn, welcomed the ECB's move, saying the step - taken in response to turbulence caused by the U.S. Federal Reserve's plan to slow monetary stimulus - was needed to preserve recovery in Europe.""The United States and Europe are at different points of the economic cycle. While the U.S. has a more restrictive approach, Europe needs to continue with a more accommodative policy,"" the EU monetary affairs commissioner said. FISCAL RULESWhile he does not see sufficient support in the euro zone for governments to give up sovereignty on fiscal matters to forge a fiscal union to prevent such crises in the future, Weidmann pressed them to stiffen Europe's fiscal rules.""To fully unleash the common currency's potential, efforts are needed on two fronts: structural reforms as well as the abolition of implicit guarantees for banks and sovereigns (government bonds),"" Weidmann said.""In addition to stronger rules, we need to make sure that in a system of national control and national responsibility, sovereign default is possible without bringing down the financial system. Only then will we really do away with the implicit guarantee for sovereigns.""The Bundesbank chief also called for euro zone governments to sever what he describes as the ""excessively close links"" between banks and sovereign governments, saying that European banks hold too many of their own governments' bonds.""This is because banks do not have to hold any capital against their government debt, as the risk-weight assigned to sovereign bonds is zero.To counteract excessive investment in sovereign bonds, Weidmann believes that the capital rules need to be changed to take account of risk and exposure levels.""Only then will banks be able to cope with the repercussions of sovereign default."""
