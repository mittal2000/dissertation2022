0,TRAVEL,TSA Poll: Majority Of Americans Think Agency Is Doing A Good Job,Andrea Stone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gallup-poll-majority-say_us_5b9c1e57e4b03a1dcc7c6f3a,"The survey, conducted July 9-12, found little difference of opinion between fliers and those who haven't flown in the last",2012-08-09,"Passenger Don Heim, right, of Alpharetta, Ga., is briefed by Transportation Security Administration trainer Byron Gibson before going through a new expedited security line Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2011 at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. The TSA unveiled the pilot program to pre-screen a small group of select air travelers who volunteer more personal information about themselves so they can be vetted to get faster screening at airport checkpoints. (AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c1e5726000032007f5ca6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Forget the latest horror story about the Transportation Security Administration. A majority of Americans think the TSA is alright, according to a new Gallup poll.When asked how the government agency that handles airport security is doing, 54 percent said the TSA is doing either an excellent or a good job. Yet, when asked if the agency's screening procedures are extremely or very effective at preventing acts of terrorism on U.S. airplanes, just 41 percent agreed. Most said the agency was somewhat or not effective.The survey, conducted July 9-12, found little difference of opinion between fliers and those who haven't flown in the last year. If anything, more frequent fliers were slightly more positive about the TSA than those who haven't flown recently. Gallup said younger Americans were ""significantly"" more positive about the agency than seniors, a discrepancy it said may partly reflect the fact that 60 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds have flown within the last year compared with 33 percent of those aged 65 and older.Even though the TSA last year revised its screening policy for those under 12 years old after a series of videos of enhanced pat-downs of young travelers sparked public outrage, Gallup found adults without minor children and parents shared similar opinions of the agency.The findings may surprise some, given recent headlines about seemingly egregious  abuses by TSA agents. They also will offer a counter-narrative to Republican critics like Rep. John Mica of Florida who never misses an opportunity to criticize the agency and has waged a crusade to privatize airport security.""TSA employees work hard every day to protect the traveling public,"" an obviously pleased TSA Administrator John Pistole said in a statement. ""This positive report reaffirms TSA's commitment to carrying out these responsibilities with efficiency, integrity and in a customer friendly manner.""Last year, another poll registered only 38 percent positive customer satisfaction. At the time, Pistole admitted to the Wall Street Journal that ""there will continue to be incidents"" but said improved training and a risk-based system based on common sense would bring down complaints.Despite TSA's efforts to improve screening, abuses continue to be reported on an almost daily basis. The watchdog blog TSA News, noting the poll was released the same day that two former TSA screeners in Atlanta were indicted for drug smuggling, was skeptical.""Anecdotal evidence, eyewitness testimony, and comments on published TSA stories would predict that the answer to this would have been overwhelmingly negative,"" it wrote, adding that ""Gallup didnâ€™t disclose who sponsored the poll or if the TSA or one of its vendors had any input on it. As we all know by now, pollsters can get any result they want by controlling the way questions are asked and the group that is polled.""But Gallup managing editor Jeff Jones rejected the inference that the poll was skewed.""No one sponsored it. Gallup paid for it,"" he told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""This was completely done by Gallup poll editors. We had no contact with TSA at all.""Jones said the TSA questions were part of a larger survey that also asked about smoking and drinking habits and used Gallup's ""standard methodology.""""This is a representative sample of Americans,"" he said."
1,DIVORCE,Do Genes Explain Why Divorce Affects Children In Different Ways?,"Robert Hughes, Jr., Contributor
Professor of Human Development, University of Illinois at Urba...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/do-genes-explain-why-divo_us_5b9c0f53e4b03a1dcc7c154e,One of the most consistent research findings that explore the effects of divorce on children is that the results are inconsistent.,2012-08-08,Sad boy. Depressed teenager at home. Problems at family,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c0f532400003200530f9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most consistent research findings that explore the effects of divorce on children is that the results are inconsistent. Yes, that is what I meant to write. Thirty years of scientific study have concluded that there are no simple answers to the question about how children will be affected by divorce. In 2010 Paul Amato summarized current research and concluded, ""A reasonable assumption is that divorce can have varied consequences, with some children showing improvements in well-being, other children showing little or no change, some children showing decrements that gradually improve and yet other children developing problems that persist into adulthood."" This does not mean that scientists have not gained insight into what is best for children. For example, there is persuasive evidence that children are more likely to have difficulties when they live in households with lower incomes, parents who are having difficulty adjusting and who are inconsistent in their parenting, and continue to be in conflict with their former partner. But despite these findings, there continues to be some children who weather even these difficult circumstances. ""Why?"" ask scientists. ""What is different about these children?""As we learn more about the role of biology in human development, there is a growing body of research that has been exploring the role of genes in the well-being of children. Could there be ""protector"" genes that make some children more invulnerable to their family circumstances? Are there genes that make children more at-risk of poor outcomes when there are family crises or transitions? The scientific story won't be any simpler than the current explanations about the consequences of divorce for children, but this work promises to provide us with a richer understanding of how our biological selves interact with the social environments of family, school, and neighborhood to result in who we become. A recent study by Esther Nederhof and colleagues took a careful look how genes and family environment may influence outcomes for children whose parents were divorced. Nederhof and her colleagues followed a sample of over 1,000 Dutch adolescents from about 11 to 16 years of age. They looked at families in which both parents were married and families in which there was a divorce. The scientists measured several dopamine genes that have been shown to be important in understanding aggressive and antisocial behaviors and have been connected to variations in other social environments. Children's aggressive and antisocial behavior which has been commonly linked to divorce was also measured. In this study, the scientists were particularly interested in comparing adolescents with and without specific dopamine genotypes and the marital status of their parents; they looked at antisocial and aggressive behavior in each group. In part, the scientists hypothesized that ""some individuals carry a genetic liability that predisposes them to problematic functioning (e.g., antisocial behavior, depression) when confronted with a contextual stressor [such as the divorce of their parents]."" The results indicate that that two of the three dopamine genotypes tested showed these types of results. Adolescents whose parents had divorced were more likely to engage in antisocial behavior if they had the dopamine genotype. If they did not have the genotype, then their antisocial behavior was similar to adolescents whose parents had not divorced. In short, for those adolescents without the specific dopamine genotype, the marital status of their parents was not a factor in the amount of antisocial behavior they displayed. This evidence indicates that children with a particular genetic makeup are more vulnerable to difficulties due to their parent's divorce. Often there are findings that indicate that boys are more likely than girls to be antisocial. It is worth noting that this genetic and marital status pattern held true for both adolescent boys and girls. Girls with divorced parents and the specific dopamine genotype also had more antisocial behavior. So where does this leave us? Should parents planning to divorce get their children's genes tested? No. This is an early study that looks at these issues. Scientists are a long way from drawing firm conclusions about the role of genes in development and about the ways in which genes and the social environment interact. However, this is a reminder that understanding the effects of divorce on children's development is complicated. At present scientists can provide some general, useful guidelines for parents (See Robert Emery, The Truth about Children and Divorce and JoAnne Pedro-Carroll, Putting Children First), but there are few absolutes in the parenting of children."

The Commerce Department says new-home sales fell 1.6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 313,000 homes. Sales have fallen nearly 7 percent since December. (AP Photo/Amy Sancetta)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c1afd2200005600d91da5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Trulia Price Monitor and the Trulia Rent Monitor are the earliest leading indicators of how asking prices and rents are trending nationally and locally. They adjust for the changing mix of listed homes and therefore show what's really happening to asking prices and rents. Because asking prices lead sales prices by approximately two or more months, the Monitors reveal trends before other price indexes do. With that, here's the scoop on where prices and rents are headed.Most Markets Now Have Year-Over-Year Price Increases Asking prices were up once again month over month in July, by 0.5%. Asking prices have moved up six straight months since February (the May number was revised slightly upward). This means that the sales price gains starting to be reported by Case-Shiller and other indexes should continue throughout the year. The year-over-year price change is positive, at 1.1%; excluding foreclosures, prices are up 2.7% year over year. For the first time, the majority of large metros (62 out of 100) had year-over-year gains, and a strong majority (84 out of 100) had quarter-over-quarter gains.Look Who Made the Top Ten: Hello, Las Vegas; Goodbye, Miami Housing prices have turned around in the past year. Last July, asking prices nationally were falling; in October they stabilized; and since February have been rising. A lot has happened in this turnaround year.When we look at year-over-year changes in prices, we see the total effect of a year that had ups and downs. The top price gainers for the full year (July 2011 to July 2012) were Phoenix, Cape Coral -- Fort Myers FL and Miami. Two other Florida metros -- West Palm Beach and Orlando -- are among the ten metros with the largest year-over-year increases.But when we focus only on the most recent quarter, the list looks very different. Two Southwestern metros -- Tucson and Las Vegas -- join Phoenix, while Oakland and San Francisco join next-door San Jose in the top ten. Finally, Baton Rouge, Birmingham and Cleveland round out the newcomers on the list.Who's missing? Florida. NONE of the four Florida metros with the biggest year-over-year gains is on the top ten list for the most recent quarter. That means their year-over-year gains happened mostly before this quarter, and in the coming months they'll be dropping off the list of metros with the largest year-over-year asking price increases. Comparing year-over-year gains with the most recent quarter-over-quarter gains, it's clear that the housing price recovery has shifted from Florida to Arizona, California and Nevada.The chart below takes a closer look at Miami, Las Vegas and Phoenix. Big price increases came to Miami last fall, to Phoenix in the winter, and to Las Vegas only recently. (Remember ALL of our quarter-over-quarter changes are seasonally adjusted individually for each metro because seasonal patterns  differ across the country.) For much of the last year, home prices rose sharply in Miami but fell in Las Vegas. Now the tables have turned. Gains in Las Vegas home prices have jumped ahead of Miami.Why have the biggest price gains shifted away from Florida? One reason is job growth, which drives home price growth. San Francisco, San Jose and even Las Vegashave had strong job growth in the past quarter. Also, the hardest-hit metros during the bust are no longer getting the lift they had been enjoying: investors, including foreign homebuyers, found bargains in Florida a year ago, but Florida's price gains over the past year make its housing less attractive to investors today. Finally, the declining vacancy rate in Las Vegas is boosting prices as buyers have fewer homes to choose from and sellers have less competition; only San Jose, where prices are also rising, saw a larger drop in vacancies.However, the biggest lesson from these changing rankings is that no price increase is forever. What goes up must come down. Price declines attract homebuyers, who then bid prices up; price increases trigger new construction and expand supply, which then pushes prices back down. Prices can shift quickly, even though other measures of the housing market -- like construction and the vacancy rate -- change much more slowly.Remember that we're looking at asking prices for the most recent quarter. Since the Trulia Price Monitor reports price trends that are happening now, this westward shift in the home-price recovery hasn't fully shown up on the main sales-price indexes yet -- but they will.Rents Continue their Climb Finally, rents are still rising even faster than asking prices. Nationally, rents rose 5.3% year over year -- well ahead of the 1.1% year-over-year increase in asking prices. Rents increased year over year in 24 of the 25 largest rental markets, and rose faster than home prices in 21 of those 25. Rents fell only in Las Vegas, and only by 1.4%. In six major markets, rents increased by more than 10% year over year, with San Francisco clocking the largest increase at 12.4%. To put this into perspective, only two large rental markets had year-over-year rent increases of 10% or more three months ago. What's behind these rising rents? Markets with the largest rent increases tend to have low vacancy rates and strong job growth.That's all for July. We'll report on August price and rent trends on Wednesday, September 5, 2012 at 10AM ET. How did we put this report together? To recap the methodology, the Trulia Price Monitor and the Trulia Rent Monitor track asking home prices and rents on a monthly basis, adjusting for the changing composition of listed homes, including foreclosures provided by RealtyTrac. The Trulia Price Monitor also accounts for the regular seasonal fluctuations in asking prices in order to reveal the underlying trend in prices. The Monitors can detect price movements at least three months before the major sales-price indexes do. Our FAQs provide all the technical details. "

With all the tools available to us, such as spell check on our computers and mobile phones, one would think we'd easily pass the netiquette test so our email etiquette would be picture perfect. Unfortunately this isn't always the case. Computer software programs don't always know the context of the communication. Auto-correct should be renamed auto-incorrect as we type away on our iPhones and iPads, often without noticing the new word that our devices have created. As a result, we often find ourselves pressing the send button while we're in a rush or before we've thoroughly reviewed an email, sending a text to the wrong person, or sending a sloppy and misunderstood tweet. In a split second, we often find ourselves in the digital doghouse after sending an electronic communication we wish we could take back. In my upcoming book, The Rules of Netiquette: How to Mind Your Manners on the Web, I clearly state the following: ""Use spell check to check your spelling and grammar before pushing the send button on an email or important correspondence. However don't correct someone's spelling unless they've asked for a critique.""It makes sense, doesn't it? Take a digital moment and think about it. If you were writing to a potential investor or employer and you noticed a typo in their business plan or in a job description on LinkedIn, would you bring it to their attention? Would you expect to get funded or be hired? I doubt it. These digital disasters happen more frequently than not, but should the recipient correct your spelling and grammar in their reply? I say ""no."" When you add matters of the heart to the equation the emotions get magnified, often to the point of no return. This is where I jump in while helping singles looking for love online with their online dating profiles and email introductions.A recent communication on an Internet dating site was brought to my attention, where a gentleman clearly broke the ""Rules of Netiquette.""What exactly did he do wrong? He found a woman's profile he truly liked. He then insulted her in his initial email and corrected a grammatical error, took a screen-shot of the improper sentence and then forwarded it to her. It wasn't the kind of romantic a gesture you'd expect from someone who wanted to find a serious relationship and meet this particular woman.His Inappropriate CritiqueSubject: Commented on your profile essay The portion of the essay he was referring to What she should have written?In her online dating profile, she meant to write ""inspires"" and incorrectly wrote ""aspires"" instead. Was it worth making a big deal out of? Considering her entire profile had been written without typos, caps, exclamation marks or filled with acronyms, his comment on her essay clearly was a case of bad social netiquette.While I believe you should use the spelling and grammar check on business and social emails, ""aspires"" was not incorrectly spelled and slipped through the cracks. If you look closely at his comment, ironically you'll notice a few grammatical errors on his end. Was the pot calling the digital kettle black? Should you use slang and shorten words in an email if you're not limited to 140 characters on Twitter or 160 in a text message?As an online dating expert and one who diligently preaches about first impressions and netiquette, he failed miserably.Stunned by receiving this email from a potential suitor, she decided she had four choices: 1. Ignore it. 2. Delete it and possibly block him. 3. Write back and laugh it off. 4. Write back and let him know he was correct about one thing. He was a jerk.She chose option four and responded as follows:Subject: Re: Commented on your profile essayWhile I appreciate a profile with perfect punctuation, I don't believe an introduction email to someone whose profile you actually liked should start with a critique unless they've asked for one.  Was it too harsh of a reply? What would you have done? She projected to the future and wondered how this gentleman treated the servers at restaurants and if her life would be filled with criticism on every date with this man.Feeling completely embarrassed, the gentleman pursuer wrote a 300+ word apology letter, blaming his behavior on his father. But she appreciated that he didn't get defensive and it didn't create a cyber flame war. His ReplyThank you for your note and other than attempt to explain (not sure that's possible), I apologize and am truly sorry for sending that note to you, truly. Jerk is correct and more than kind and again, rather than you simply dismissing this stupidity with no response, I can't thank you enough for your words, thoughts and feelings in your response.At the end of the digital day, we all make mistakes, but first impressions do matter.

Since he is 3-years-old now, a quick calculation led me to realize that by the Olympic Games of 2028, he can win his first gold medal in men's floor exercise. By the first date of class, we already bought a few outfits, a gym bag and he had been off of sweets for already two days. Nothing will take the Olympic dream away from me, well, aside from a young boy who unfortunately is not that good at gymnastics.All gossip magazines last month were concentrating on the Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes divorce, and all of them showed Katie (and a week later Tom) taking Suri to her gymnastic class at the same place my son is now going. ""There it is,"" I told my partner with tears. ""If it's good for Suri, there is no way it won't be good enough for me"" -- my son, that is. Katie and I will sit together at the balcony and watch our kids tumbling while I give her the recipe for my mother's chicken soup. But back to sports: the facilities look so professional and I couldn't wait to see his somersaults and double back-hand springs, after all, he is already a champ on the playground. He runs faster than his friends, and jumps higher, so basically he has all the physical requirements to be a professional athlete. And then the class began. At first I thought it was just the warm-up, but as minutes pass I realized that something is wrong, and surprisingly something is not going as planned. It wasn't the fact that he didn't jump or run fast. He even listened to and followed instructions. Instead, it was the lack of finesse. All the movements were too strong and too aggressive. ""He is a bit all over the place,"" the teacher explained to me after the class. This leads me to asking, is finesse a necessary tool for life? And where do I teach him such a thing? Is there a class at the 92nd Y? I think not. In some circles I am considered to have royalty style etiquette. Is this not hereditary? Is my Olympic dream over now, all because of someone who couldn't leap like Gabrielle Douglas, or at least show a promising foundation for such a future?I tried to consult with the one who knows it all -- my friend Google -- and I asked him, ""What do I need to do to make my son an Olympic gold medal winner?"" His answer was brutal: At any given moment there are 125,000 kids practicing in the country in top elite gymnastics programs. Only four of them will make it. I went back to the Olympic broadcasts and tried to figure out if maybe there are better sports for him. After watching countless hours of sports (who knew that rifle shooting is now considered an Olympic sport), I realized that finesse is part of the package. No matter how defined your six-pack, if you don't have the perfect combination of Hercules and the prima-ballerina, these games are not for you. I look at the girl practicing with my son; each of her moves has a swan-style attached to it. I looked at her mother cheering and was thinking to myself, ""Such a stage mother, give the child some air -- she is only three."" Although my initial goal for my son's sports career was to show him that as long as we practice, we can achieve whatever we want... but then I decided to pull the plug on gymnastics. Yes, just like that. He can jump and run on the playground with no $450 fee for 10 classes. Don't get me wrong though -- I am still full of ambition for my child and with no hesitation, I have already registered him for piano class. And yet again before his first class, I must admit that I have already looked at the admissions requirements for Julliard. After all, he has the fingers of a pianist."

I grew up in the 80s and 90s in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with intellectual parents, so tolerance and acceptance had always been a part of my conditioning. I was also raised Catholic, and what I personally understood from my countless Sundays at church were the lessons of love that Jesus exemplified. As my teachings in school morphed from ""what color is an apple"" to world history lessons I was horrified to learn of genocide and slavery. My childmind could not wrap my head around one fundamental question. Why all the hate? In the 5th grade we all watched the the mini series Eyes on the Prize which is a documentary about the Civil Rights Movement. Sitting among my black classmates it was unfathomable to think that just 40 years prior we wouldn't have been in the same school, or playing at the same playground. Watching the policemen take fire hoses to women and children and beating these peaceful protesters are images that I will never get out of my head. I remember crying uncontrollably, not understanding how or why people would treat people like that. To help explain the history of race relations we also watched the series Roots, about the slave trade in this country. To comprehend that American History for my black friends traced back to their being slaves was almost too much to process. I felt so ashamed and guilty for what white people had done. This looming question of not only why did this happen haunted my soul, but also how could people have let it happen? I would fantasize that if I were living in that time I would have been different. I would have figured out how to have gone against this oppressive and disturbing system. Needless to say when reading Anne Frank and learning about the Holocaust I had the same reaction. I would have helped. When I was exposed to narratives about the massive genocide of Native Americans I would picture myself being different. Fighting along with them, not against them. I wanted to believe that if I had been alive for all those moments I would have been on the other side of history. As I got into high school I still was extremely confused to how all of these things could have happened. The explanations I was given left a filthy taste in my mouth. For slavery it was simplified rhetoric. ""Well, people allowed this because they didn't understand that black people were actually people. The Constitution said they considered 3/5 of a person, so that is what people thought."" When I would question why the Americans took so long to interfere with the Holocaust it was because ""they didn't know what was going on. As soon as the U.S. found out they went to help."" I don't even think anyone even bothered clarifying what happened with Native Americans. Embarrassingly, it wasn't until college when I finally researched these questions myself and discovered the economics behind all these horrors; the money to be made, the greed, the financial corruption. All these questions about morality and human compassion were suddenly uncovered. The people in power, the educated, the elite, they weren't hating for the sake of hate, they were making money. There was a business behind the bigotry. This culture was then passed down to the ignorant citizens who developed a personal vendetta to support the hate and violence. The people became the mouthpiece for an agenda they had no true understanding of. The hate was contagious and atrocious for our collective memories, but at least there was a deliberate schema behind it. Despite the fact that I would never justify the hate, I could wrap my head around such an explanation of the cause. And I may or may not be right about my theories concerning the nurturing of hate by the power elites from on high. But now my understanding has reached a new level of response, partly because I am now a parent. It has to do with a specific event in contemporary America. With the blatant hate that is currently being manifested towards gay people there is no Wizard of Oz making money behind the curtain. This hate is hate for the sake of hate. I try and picture how parents explain to their children why eating Chick-Fil-A is a great opportunity to brand your hate, and I dry heave at the thought. The justification of homophobia through religion makes me want to beg these people to return to their scriptures and internalize the lessons of Jesus. ""Love thy Enemy."" That simple message is as clear as day, and leaves no room for hate. When I see that politicians, public representatives of this country, are tweeting pictures of themselves slathered in Chick-Fil-A as a statement against gay marriage I am ashamed to be an American. This is our time in history to be a part of the dissent, not the oppression. I will not have my daughter, now a two-year-old, ask me in 10 years how I stood by and did nothing. In fact, she has a book called Freckle Face Strawberry where one of the main characters has two mommies and all my daughter had to say about that is ""How lucky! He has two mommies!"" It is time we stop trying to close the minds of our children and learn from them how to open our hearts."
