We feel that Egypt is facing danger and we will perform our duties to protect the country,"" said Samir El Sayid, an editor at state-run Al-Ahram, Egypt's most well-known newspaper.""I have a sense of belonging to Egypt and will do what is appropriate to serve its interests.""Many journalists from state and private media have hailed Sisi as the country's savior since he ousted President Mohamed Mursi last year and cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood. Security forces have killed hundreds and thrown thousands in jail. MUSLIM BROTHERHOODInstead of taking an even-handed approach to the political struggle that unfolded after Mursi's overthrow, the media has opened its own front against the Islamists, supporting the government view that they are terrorists.Like the army-backed administration and its wealthy supporters Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, many Egyptian journalists view the Brotherhood as an existential threat, demonizing the group in the name of stability.Neither state nor private media question official assertions that the Brotherhood is a terrorist group, even though the authorities have not presented compelling evidence that it was behind bombings and shootings that have killed hundreds of police and soldiers since Mursi was toppled.Rather than using press conferences to ask tough questions about allegations of human rights abuses, some journalists voluntarily pledge their backing for the Interior Ministry.Graphic images of the aftermath of militant attacks on security forces are on front pages of newspapers on an almost daily basis, accompanied by praise for Sisi, who served as military intelligence chief under Mubarak.Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh, a moderate Islamist who came fourth in Egypt's 2012 presidential election, described pro-army television stations as ""black media"".He said they aimed to brainwash Egyptians into thinking that a crackdown on political opposition was part of ""a war on terror"".Like many other Egyptians, journalists accused Mursi of usurping power, imposing the Brotherhood's view of Islam and mismanaging the economy during his year in office, allegations he denies.The Islamist media was shut down almost immediately after the army takeover and it has not reopened.""I tried at the beginning of their (the Mursi government's) year in power to be a bit balanced. I tried but I can tell you I was not successful I was not balanced, definitely. How can I be balanced with a terrorist regime?"" asked Lamees al-Hadidi, who hosts one of Egypt's most popular television talk shows.""I decided I don't want to live under this regime. I am the opposition and I decided to take the stance of the opposition.""Hadidi defended the Egyptian media, which treats criticism from allies and foes alike as a conspiracy to undermine the country.She argued that some American television channels have an agenda and do not come under the same scrutiny, citing coverage of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the mood in the United States after the Sept. 11 al Qaeda attacks.Sisi promised that a political road map he announced after overthrowing Mursi would lead to democracy.But his comments suggest he believes journalists should forget about holding the state to account, at least for now, and serve their country.""We need to form, in the conscience of citizens, the idea that Egypt is the big family that everyone must protect. The nation at this time needs the media to work on this because if Egypt falls it will not come back,"" online news website Sada Albalad quoted Sisi as saying at a meeting.He does not need to stress the point, it seems.In a televised session between Sisi and local journalists, one stood up and urged Egypt to have a law regulating the media.""It should not be left to the conscience of the people,"" she said.Journalists say authorities never force them to change copy or broadcasts. But there seem to be red lines that can't be crossed. DISSENT WITH A PRICEA number of Egyptian anchors and commentators who criticized the army no longer appear in the media, though it is not clear why. None responded to Reuters requests for interviews.Hadidi says on occasions when she presented a more balanced view, she faced a backlash from the public and in some cases was at risk of prosecution.""Many times media follows the mainstream, which is wrong. We get pressured. I am worried I will be a lonely voice as there are many extreme voices and populism,"" Hadidi said.""I'm worried about these extreme voices that hail everything the authorities say, it's terrifying.""Egypt has put three Al Jazeera journalists on trial on charges of aiding members of a ""terrorist organization"". Human rights groups say the case shows the authorities are trampling on freedom of expression.Sticking to the official line is still the safest bet, three years after hundreds of thousands of Egyptians protested in Cairo's Tahrir Square and helped bring down Mubarak.Some go beyond it.In a popular private newspaper, Almasry Alyoum, columnist Ghada Sherif suggested Egyptians should do anything for the man expected to be their new leader.""He really doesn't have to give orders. It is enough for him to wink or even flutter his eyelashes and he will find us all in his service,"" wrote Sherif.""If he wants us as concubines we won't be out of reach.""

But many voters in the Russian-speaking east will find polling stations shut.European election monitors largely pulled out of Donetsk region for their own safety, citing a campaign of ""terror"" by pro-Russian separatists against Ukrainian electoral officials.Polls make a billionaire confectionery magnate known as the ""chocolate king"" overwhelming favorite, with a high turnout expected on a warm day. The biggest question is whether Petro Poroshenko can take over 50 percent to win in a single round.He was a strong backer of the protests against Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich last winter and has sought a quick victory by warning that new unrest might prevent a second round.His closest, if distant, rival is Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister. She seems best placed to contest a runoff in three weeks, but remains a divisive figure to many, more closely linked with the economic failures and corruption that have blighted 23 years of independence.As Yanukovich's fiercest rival, she may benefit from the fact that few of the 5 million voters in his eastern power base regions of Donetsk and Luhansk may be able to cast ballots for any of the 21 candidates.Officials say many polling stations will not open for fear of attack and only early on Sunday will they try to distribute ballot papers to those areas where voting may be possible.Interim Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said on Saturday the act of voting would be victory, hand the new president a mandate to forge closer ties with the European Union and move Ukraine away from a ""grey zone of lawlessness and dark forces that dream of suffocating us and into ... a place where it is easier to breathe"". PUTIN TO ""RESPECT"" RESULTWestern states backed those who took power when Yanukovich fled to Russia three months ago after street protests triggered by his rejection of a free trade pact with the EU. They hope that a mandate for a new leader can help resolve a confrontation with Russia that has sparked military buildups east and west of Ukraine and raised fears of a new Cold War.Putin pledged on Saturday to ""respect"" the people's choice and work with Ukraine's new administration - a conciliatory move during an economic forum at which he had acknowledged that U.S. and EU sanctions over Ukraine were hurting the Russian economy.But he defended his annexation of Crimea in March as a response to the democratic will of the majority ethnic Russian population there. Kiev and its Western allies accuse Moscow of a propaganda war to sow fear among Russian-speakers in eastern and southern Ukraine of ""fascist"" Ukrainian nationalists and of supporting rebel forces who have seized many towns in the east.Two weeks ago, separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk regions ran referendums they said let them break from Kiev and opened a way to possibly following Crimea into union with Russia - though Moscow denies any plan to seize any more Ukrainian territory.Opinion polls before the last few months of violence showed disillusion with Kiev's politicians in the Russian-speaking, industrial east but limited appetite for outright secession.Putin played down talk of a return to Cold War with the West and dismissed the idea he was bent on restoring the former USSR, whose collapse he has in the past lamented.Washington and its EU allies are concerned that while Russia may accept the election result, it may use influence in eastern Ukraine to undermine the new president's authority and keep the country beholden to Moscow. Russian officials have questioned the value of holding the vote when the east is in ""civil war"". NEW BEGINNING?A territory on a par with France and with 45 million people, Ukraine is the second most populous ex-Soviet state and plays a pivotal role in relations between Russia and the EU.Large volumes of Russian natural gas flow across it to Germany and other consumers, creating mutual dependencies that complicate diplomatic calculations on all sides of the conflict.The inheritor of a patchwork of regions ruled not only from Moscow but by Poland, Austria and others, Ukraine's mix of Russian and Ukrainian speakers as well as ethnic minorities have struggled to forge a common national purpose. But polls consistently show a majority in favor of independence.Since the 2004 ""Orange Revolution"" that kept Yanukovich from power, Ukrainians of all stripes have been disappointed with a decade of economic drift and graft that won them the dubious distinction of being named Europe's most corrupt country. Their hopes are pinned on Sunday's vote to start history afresh.Few of the leading candidate are new faces, however.Both Poroshenko and Tymoshenko played leading roles in the administrations that preceded Yanukovich's defeat of Tymoshenko in the 2010 election. Poroshenko, now a burly 48-year-old, later held a cabinet post for a time under Yanukovich.Both became wealthy in the anarchic post-Soviet 1990s, Poroshenko, now worth $1.3 billion according to Forbes, through his candy and chocolate empire, Tymoshenko as the ""gas princess"" involved in the trade and transit of Russian natural gas.After the Orange Revolution, when he was head of the National Security Council and she prime minister, the two traded accusations of corruption. Tymoshenko, 53, was jailed in 2011 for corrupt gas deals with Russia but was released when Yanukovich was toppled and her record cleared.Olga, 82, strolling in central Kiev on Saturday, said Poroshenko was best placed to end six months of uncertainty.""He is a businessman,"" she noted doubtfully as she made her way with her husband Nikolai across Independence Square, known as Maidan, where militant anti-Yanukovich protesters are still camped out, determined to hold new leaders to their promises.""But he'll be good for the state and the people. He has factories near us and created jobs. He can calm things down.""But in the easternmost city of Luhansk, would-be voter Oleksander Cherednichenko doubted residents would be able to take part: ""People are afraid that if they do go to a polling station that there will be gunmen there,"" he said.""The best case scenario is that gunmen will just tell them to get out. The worst case scenario is that they shoot them.""

Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ca6e3c000066000df575.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SHANGHAI -- People wonder what China will do for an economic encore after three decades of nuts-and-bolts industrial growth. But all you need to do is look at your smartphone to find the answer.It’s ITC, e-commerce and social media. This ancient society is an ideal growth medium for all three.In America, we favor the ""genius in the garage"" theory of the 21st century economy: Our great universities will churn out a new Bill Gates or Steve Jobs and we will be fine.But connectivity is the new engine, and China is a monument to it. Profit in this new economy is less a matter of quantum leaps of innovative imagination than of the steady build-out of systems and methods for extending communication. In China, a nation of 1.3 billion people, the historic burden of vast size and population has become what Adam Smith would call a comparative advantage.The ancient Chinese built a network of transportation canals that in that day were far ahead of anything else in the world. Now, having poured vast sums into physical infrastructure, with more to come, the nation can draw on its supply of labor to handle the fast-delivery requirements of e-commerce.Companies such as Weibo, WeChat and Huawei -- just to mention three of the dozens rising here -- are creating and riding a wave as China expands its own digital systems and uses the momentum of that growth to expand worldwide.It’s probably too late for American companies to get a truly major piece of the action on all of this; the Chinese tech companies are now moving too fast, and government restrictions on solo foreign investment remain too daunting. Chinese companies are headed to Wall Street for more backing, and their success so far means that they will get financing from around the world to expand their reach.With even more money to spend, China doesn’t mind if it relies on “technology transfer” -- purchased legally or otherwise. There's a reputation that some here are not too proud to buy, steal or copy ideas. But, the nation is increasingly relying on home-grown engineering talent to handle the prosaic but essential tasks of building networks, writing code and designing sites and apps to meet the gargantuan needs for a digital society here.Huawei is an example.The telecom giant's research headquarters here have the super-secure, vaguely ominous aura of a military contractor -- a kind of Lockheed Martin of the East.The long, glass-walled corridors are empty, the floors carefully polished, and few people can be found on the crosswalks that traverse an atrium. Nothing is out of place anywhere. You don’t see any of the 10,000 engineers at work when you are invited to a conference room with plush chairs and TV screens.Huawei isn’t a government contractor, and isn’t even owned by the government in a country described by its new-generation leaders as a “Confucian socialist state.”It’s a private company, founded by one man, Ren Zhengfei, and owned by its employees, including him. Whether it is truly “private” or not is up for debate, but in the end a meaningless question. Ren is a veteran of China's army, and the company has close ties to the government.Huawei tried to buy an American company but was rebuffed. No matter. They are moving ahead on their own, with their own.Meanwhile, the Chinese will buy imagination if they can’t supply it themselves. Here in Shanghai -- a cosmopolitan city that has a Western feel -- planners are hoping to attract creative talent from around the world to live and work.If they can’t beat Silicon Valley, they can at least try to import a version of it."

(AP) — The son of a Hollywood director stabbed three men to death in his apartment, gunned down two women outside a sorority and killed a sixth person in a rampage that was foreshadowed by a chilling Internet video in which he vowed to his victims that he would ""take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you.""Authorities said the 22-year-old lone gunman, Elliot Rodger — the son of a director who worked on the ""The Hunger Games"" — carried out his attacks Friday night in the beach community of Isla Vista near the University of California, Santa Barbara. The rampage happened hours after he looked into a video camera and warned in a disturbing Internet video that he would slaughter those with a good life — especially women who shunned him, authorities said.Deputies wounded him during two separate shootouts as he sped through Isla Vista, leaving a trail of bloodshed that ended with Rodger apparently shooting himself in the head before crashing his black BMW into a parked car, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.Thirteen people were injured — eight from gunshot wounds, four from being hit by his car and one who suffered a minor injury whose exact cause was not clear yet, Brown said.Deputies found three semi-automatic handguns with 400 unspent rounds in his black BMW. All were purchased legally.Authorities had had three contacts with Rodgers in the past year, including one case in which he claimed to be beaten but deputies suspected he was the aggressor. On April 30, officials went to his Isla Vista apartment again to check on him at the request of his family. But deputies reported back that the Santa Barbara community college student was shy, polite and having a difficult social life but did not need to be taken in for mental health reasons, Brown said.Attorney Alan Shifman said the Rodger family had called police after being alarmed by YouTube videos ""regarding suicide and the killing of people"" that Elliot Rodger had been posting.Brown called the tragedy ""the work of a madman"" and said the videotape posted by Rodger the night of the killings is a ""particularly chilling one, in which he looks at the camera and talks about what he is about to do.""In the YouTube video, Rodger sits in a car and looks at the camera, laughing often, and says he is going to take his revenge against humanity. He describes loneliness and frustration because ""girls have never been attracted to me,"" and says, at age 22, he is still a virgin. The video, which is almost seven minutes long, appears scripted.""I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you. You will finally see that I am, in truth, the superior one, the true alpha male,"" he says on the video.Police described how he spent 10 minutes traveling from one location to another and opened fire on random people after leaving a gruesome scene at his apartment, where three men were stabbed to death.Earlier Saturday, Shifman issued a statement saying Peter Rodger believed his son, Elliot Rodger, was the shooter. It was unclear how the son would have obtained a gun. The family is staunchly against guns, he added.""The Rodger family offers their deepest compassion and sympathy to the families involved in this terrible tragedy. We are experiencing the most inconceivable pain, and our hearts go out to everybody involved,"" Shifman said.Richard Martinez said his son Christopher Ross Michael-Martinez, 20, was killed in the shooting. He blamed politicians and gun-rights proponents. ""When will this insanity stop? ... Too many have died. We should say to ourselves 'not one more,'"" he said.The shootings started around 9:30 p.m. in Isla Vista, a roughly half-square-mile community next to UC Santa Barbara's campus and picturesque beachside cliffs.Alexander Mattera, 23, said his friend Chris Johnson was walking out of an improv comedy show when he was shot in front of a popular pizza place. He stumbled into a nearby house.""He walked into these random guys' house bleeding,"" he said.Mattera was sitting at a bonfire with friends when at least one gunshot whizzed overhead. The friends ran for cover when they heard the barrage of gunfire.""We heard so many gunshots. It was unbelievable. I thought they were firecrackers,"" he said.Isla Vista, which is centered on university life with outdoor cafes, bike shops, burger joints, sororities and fraternities, was shrouded in fog and unusually quiet Saturday.Police tape crisscrossed Isla Vista streets, while blood was still visible on the asphalt. Bullet holes pierced windows of a parked car and the IV Deli Mart. A small shrine of flowers was growing outside the business, whose floors inside were stained with blood. For much of the day, the wrecked BMW driven by the shooter remained on the street, its windshield smashed in and its driver's door wide open.UC Santa Barbara senior Kyley Scarlet said she heard the BMW smash to a halt outside a house she was in. Scarlet, who is a former sorority president, said two women from a sorority next door were killed on the lawn, where a pile of flowers grew on Saturday.Crying students wandered up to the spot, shook their heads and hugged each other.Scarlet said a third sorority member was wounded there as well.Scarlet said she was very disturbed by the video describing his anger at sorority girls.""It's hard thinking my actions, being part of a sorority, led him to do this,"" she said. ""When I saw that video, I was shaking and crying.""In a statement, the university said it was ""shocked and saddened"" that several students were shot.""This is almost the kind of event that's impossible to prevent and almost impossible to predict,"" UC President Janet Napolitano told reporters after giving the commencement speech at Laney College in Oakland, California.California Gov. Jerry Brown offered his condolences to the victims' families, saying he was saddened to learn ""of this senseless tragedy.""The Rodger family is not ready to speak publicly yet, but wants to cooperate fully with police, Shifman said.""My client's mission in life will be to try to prevent any such tragedies from ever happening again,"" he said. ""This country, this world, needs to address mental illness and the ramifications from not recognizing these illnesses.""___Dillon and Mendoza reported from Goleta, California, and Watson reported from San Diego.

Two officers were also wounded.Security forces also conducted two other separate raids in downtown Sanaa, the statement said, but gave no details.The raids were part of an escalating campaign against militants responsible for a wave of attacks across the country.""The forces exchanged fire with the wanted men who were holed up inside a house,"" a government official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters. ""Five were killed and four were captured.""The government statement, received by email, said one of the dead militants was Saleh al-Tais, who it said was involved in the January killing of Ahmad Sharafeddin, a delegate at national reconciliation talks representing the Shi'ite Muslim Houthi group and a former dean of the law faculty at Sanaa University.One of 25 people listed by the Interior Ministry's most wanted list, Tais was the operational commander of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Sanaa who had a 5 million riyal ($25,000) bounty for his capture, the statement said.Tais, who had evaded capture more than once in the past, was involved in a number of major attacks, including an attack on the Yemeni Defense Ministry compound in Sanaa last December and the assault on the Central prison last February, it said.""Tais was also linked to a number of terrorist operations that targeted national and foreign interests, particularly the cold-blooded assassination campaign targeting security personnel in the Yemeni capital,"" it said.Explosives, car bombs and heavy weapons were found during the raid.President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi said last month that Yemen was at war with al Qaeda, as the militants have stepped up attacks on government facilities after being driven out of strongholds in southern Shabwa and Abyan provinces. TRIBAL MILITIAYemen has been in turmoil since 2011, when mass protests forced long-ruling president Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down.As well as the al Qaeda threat, the country faces challenges from separatists in the south and an emboldened Shi'ite tribal militia trying to cement its control of the northern highlands.Clashes have repeatedly erupted in the past months between government troops and members of the Houthi group - named after the Shi'ite tribe of its leaders - as Sanaa struggles to restore nationwide control.Yemeni troops killed five Houthi members on Sunday in fighting outside the city of Omran in the northern province of the same name, tribal sources and local officials said. Three soldiers were killed.The fighting followed two days of clashes outside Omran city last week in which a total of 24 from both sides died.Government forces killed scores of al Qaeda militants last month in a campaign against their strongholds in southern Shabwa and Abyan provinces.Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, regarded by the United States as one of the most active wings of the network founded by Osama bin Laden, has responded with a series of hit-and-run attacks across the country.In the latest attack, dozens of militants in army uniforms hit government buildings and army and police outposts in Seyoun, the second-biggest city in southeastern Hadramout province, early on Saturday. Authorities said 12 soldiers and 15 militants were killed.The stability of Yemen, which shares a long border with the world's top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, is an international concern. The United States has stepped up its support for the government and military, including conducting drone strikes.

But again, we've done it several times, so in some respects it gets easier each time,"" said White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes.Obama's trip was the latest in a string of secretive missions overseas that began when Republican President George W. Bush discreetly left his ranch in Crawford, Texas and popped up in Baghdad to celebrate Thanksgiving with U.S. troops in 2003.Bush went on to make other similar trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, and Obama repeated the practice once he took office in 2009. EXPLAINING WITHOUT EXPLAININGFor the Afghanistan trip, country music star Brad Paisley, who caught Obama's eye when he performed in a July 4 celebration at the White House, was pulled off a summer tour so he could accompany Obama and entertain the troops at Bagram.""He had just started a tour and he had to juggle a lot of stuff and had to try to explain it to people without explaining it to people,"" Obama told the troops with a smile.Obama brought only a small group of aides with him, including Rhodes, White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice and senior aides John Podesta and Dan Pfeiffer.A pool of White House reporters and photographers was informed on Friday about the trip and sworn to secrecy. The press group was spirited aboard Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington and was on the plane when Obama arrived late Saturday.After a flight of more than 13 hours, lights were turned off and window shades were drawn for the landing.The president, wearing an Air Force One bomber jacket, seemed to relish the surprise, telling the troops he had been in the neighborhood and ""thought I'd drop by.""Usually some subterfuge is needed to keep U.S. troops from guessing what is going on. On Sunday, troops who were not in the loop were told they were preparing for a rehearsal of some sort.Rhodes told reporters it helped that the visit took place over the long Memorial Day holiday weekend.""We have to plan these things with a high degree of secrecy and confidentiality out of the security concerns in play,"" he said. ""And that involves everything from how staff gets to Andrews, to how you all get there, to how the president does. It's not the same motorcade; it's not the same footprint.""

That bill, which also would have provided more funding for a mental health initiative, narrowly failed to advance in the Senate.""It seemed like we were on the verge of the legislation that would stop the madness and end the insanity that has killed too many young people, thousands, tens of thousands since Sandy Hook,"" Blumenthal said. ""We need mental health resources, and that initiative, I hope, will provide a common ground, a point of consensus that will bring us together.""Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who also appeared on the Sunday show, said he agreed that there should be policies in place to help people with mental illnesses get diagnoses and treated. He didn't say how much of a role gun control should play in any such legislation, though.""I think that is something on which there is agreement,"" he said of increased resources for mental health care.

If the results are confirmed, it could secure as many as 25 seats in the new European Parliament, more than eight times the three it won in 2009.""The people have spoken loud and clear,"" a triumphant Le Pen told cheering supporters at party headquarters in a northwestern suburb of Paris.""They no longer want to be led by those outside our borders, by EU commissioners and technocrats who are unelected. They want to be protected from globalization and take back the reins of their destiny,"" she said.France was a founding member of the European Union but voters have grown increasingly disenchanted with its free-market and open-border policies in recent years, rejecting a proposed EU constitution in a 2005 referendum.Partial results released by the Interior Ministry gave the FN 26 percent, even higher than expected in pre-vote polls.The party has carved out a niche in French politics, notably among disaffected working class voters who believe the mainstream elite does not understand their concerns about crime, immigration, job losses and stagnant living standards.The mainstream UMP conservative opposition came second with 20.66 percent. Hollande's Socialists took just 13.88 percent, well down from the 16.5 percent they won last time in 2009 and worse than their previous low of 14.5 percent in 1994.The FN, which Le Pen has sought to rid of its racist reputation since she took the reins from her father in 2011, campaigned on a platform of tighter borders, hostility to the euro currency and rejection of a planned EU-US trade pact.""It's an earthquake,"" said Prime Minister Manuel Valls, brought in by Hollande barely two months ago after the Socialists suffered a similar rout in local elections.""We are in a crisis of confidence ... Europe has disappointed - that's a fact,"" Valls said.He urged the 28-member bloc to give more priority to social justice and pledged his government would pursue efforts to revive the euro zone's number two economy, which saw zero growth in the first quarter, by easing the tax burden on business. SEARCHING FOR ALLIESLe Pen called for the dissolution of parliament, insisting it was no longer representative of the French people's will. The FN holds only two of 577 seats in the National Assembly.The Socialists quickly dismissed such a move which, given Hollande's record unpopularity, would almost certainly mean that his allies would lose their majority. The next presidential and parliamentary elections are not due until 2017.The score was also a blow to the conservative UMP, whose chairman Jean-Francois Cope is expected to face challenges to his leadership.""It's a big disappointment for us, but mostly an expression of anger from the French people,"" Cope said.The Interior Ministry put turnout at just over 43 percent, a few points higher than it was at the last EU election in 2009.In March the FN won control of 11 town halls - a tiny minority of France's thousands of municipalities but still a slap in the face for the mainstream left and right which have always ruled.Le Pen told Reuters in the run-up to the vote that a major priority for the FN and other Eurosceptic parties across Europe would be to form a political caucus in the European Parliament and to block a planned transatlantic trade pact.

12,GREEN,Rail Town Residents Fear Impacts Of Increased Oil Train Traffic,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rail-town-oil-train_n_5388607.html,,2014-05-25,"Recently filled, a tanker truck drives past railway cars containing crude oil on railroad tracks in McClellan Park in North Highlands on Wednesday, March 19, 2014. North Highlands is a suburb just outside the city limits of Sacramento, Calif. (Randall Benton/Sacramento Bee/MCT via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb157d7240000310096be8a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joshua Schneyer, Rory Carroll and Richard ValdmanisMay 25 (Reuters) - Albany, New York Sheriff Craig Apple assured a room of concerned citizens that county emergency crews were prepared to handle an oil-train accident involving three or four tank cars.Firefighters have been training to combat railcar fires with foam, and evacuation plans are detailed in a 500-page emergency response plan, Apple told residents in a May 12 address.But he was blunt about the potential impact of a larger derailment: ""Look, let's face it, there's going to be mayhem.""Albany's tracks handle as much as a fourth of the oil pumped from North Dakota's booming Bakken Shale, or up to several 100-car trains per day, each carrying 70,000 barrels.It is one of several spots along North America's new oil-by-rail corridors where residents and officials are restless, following six fiery derailments in the past 10 months. Some want to limit or halt the traffic, fearful that existing precautions will not prevent deadly blasts, air and waterway pollution, or nuisances including nasty odors.Since trains play a growing role in getting oil from landlocked North Dakota and central Canada to mostly coastal refineries, efforts to stop them could boost shipping costs or slow the pace of North America's oil boom. This could hit the bottom line of drillers like Continental Resources or refiners like Phillips66.The opposition extends beyond traditional hotbeds of environmental activism, to oil shipping or processing hubs like Albany, Philadelphia and St. John, New Brunswick in Canada, home to the country's largest refinery.Efforts to stop oil trains are a new battle front for several major environmental groups that have campaigned to block the Keystone XL pipeline from bringing crude south from Canada's oil sands. With Keystone in limbo, U.S.-bound rail shipments of Canadian oil have risen 20-fold since 2011, the U.S. Congressional Research Service estimated.With U.S. oil production at a 28-year high, new pipelines in booming shale areas like North Dakota's Bakken have not kept up. This has also pushed more crude onto trains.Opposition movements have scored a few small victories. Albany County has temporarily halted plans by energy logistics firm Global Partners to install boilers at its rail terminal to make oil flow faster out of tank cars.The Port of Portland, Oregon issued a blanket rejection of any proposals for crude oil transfer or storage facilities, and states including California, Washington and New York are reviewing oil-train safety. One project, a $110 million rail terminal proposed by refiner Tesoro Corp and Savage Cos. in Washington, is over budget and behind schedule, in part due to an extended state review.Oil-train opponents are adopting tactics that helped to stall Keystone XL, including street protests and demands for detailed environmental studies.But curbing oil trains may prove far trickier. Rail hubs face much less red tape than major new pipelines, and unlike pipeline operators, railroads usually are not required to submit comprehensive oil-spill response plans. OIL ABOARDU.S. cargoes have risen more than 50-fold since 2008, to around 1 million barrels a day. Volumes may reach 3 million barrels a day in 2016 -- more oil than OPEC member Venezuela pumps daily -- unless pipeline construction speeds up, Matt Rogers, a director at business consultancy McKinsey, told an energy conference last week. (For a map of operating and planned U.S. oil-train terminals and a timeline of derailments, click: http://link.reuters.com/zyt59v )California may receive 25 percent of its oil by rail in 2016, up from 1 percent now, according to the state's Energy Commission.About 60 oil-train terminals already exist along the 140,000 miles of U.S. rail tracks, and at least 30 more are planned, including eight in California.Phyllis Fox, a well known U.S. air quality expert, said many hubs won quick approval in towns or cities that did not recognize potential hazards.""They get the district to rubber stamp it,"" Fox said.The shipping trend drew little public scrutiny until a runaway oil train killed 47 people in Lac Megantic, Quebec last July.That and subsequent derailments have ignited a debate between regulators, railroads, drillers, refiners and railcar makers about who is responsible for preventing more disasters.Railroads say older tank cars known as DOT-111s, which have gained a reputation for exploding during derailments, should be ""aggressively"" phased out. Shippers say railroads must improve their infrastructure. Others suggest that volatile Bakken shale crude may be to blame.In January, the U.S. Department of Transportation warned of Bakken crude's fire risks, drawing rebukes from oil companies who say it is as safe as other U.S. varieties. This month, DOT issued a statement ""strongly urging"" shippers to use newer, safety-enhanced railcars for Bakken cargoes. But regulators did not ban older cars from handling it.The DOT has ordered railroads to inform states about large rail cargoes of Bakken crude traveling through, following complaints about lack of disclosure.""I don't think anyone has fully addressed the safety of these things,"" said Read Brugger of environmental group 350 Maine, which wants to ban oil trains in the state. ""People don't think they should be coming through our towns and cities and along our bodies of water.""Derailments have continued. A fiery April 30 oil-train accident in Lynchburg, Virginia was the worst yet to affect a U.S. city. Tank cars carrying Bakken crude toppled into the James River, a source of regional drinking water, leaking 25,000 gallons and setting the river ablaze. The exploding cars included newer models with enhanced safety features like reinforced steel plates.In January, oil-laden tank cars derailed on a rail bridge in Philadelphia, prompting a local protest.Hours before Sheriff Apple's speech in Albany, four tank cars derailed at low speed in a rail yard near the city's bustling Ezra Prentice housing complex.Canadian Pacific, the yard's operator, said there was no oil leak or fire. The railroad was fined $5,000 for failing to report the incident until five hours later.Albany County Executive Dan McCoy, a former firefighter, said he will seek jail time for rail workers who fail to report future incidents within an hour. SCARY FOOTAGE, CRUDE ODORSNorth American railroads are among the world's most efficient. The Association of American Railroads says 99.997 percent of hazardous material cargoes arrive without incident.But video from Lac Megantic shows the town center reduced to rubble, and images from derailments this year in North Dakota and Virginia feature fireballs up to 60 feet high.Some worry about more insidious risks. In St. John, the site of Canada's biggest refinery, air quality incidents have risen since operator Irving Oil built about 145,000 barrels per day of rail unloading capacity three years ago, regulatory filings show.Julie Dingwell, who lives nearby, said foul smells from the new terminal - the destination for the ill-fated Lac Megantic train - have kept her indoors several times over the past year.Weeks after the Quebec disaster, St. John residents called the fire department as Irving unloaded a batch of high-sulfur Alberta crude from rail cars, filings show.""You immediately think disaster,"" Dingwell said. ""I've lived in this industrial city most of my life, so I know bad smells. That smell was beyond.""This February, Irving sent scores of apology letters to homes nearby. ""We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience these odors may have caused you and your family,"" they say. The terminal has begun using a liquid product called Ecosorb, made by Omni Industries, to neutralize the odors, an Irving official said in an email obtained by Reuters in April.An Irving spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. MOVING WESTSome 3,000 miles to the west, oil-by-rail is gathering steam along the Pacific Coast, a region long reliant on sea-borne oil imports with no pipeline links to the Bakken.Tesoro Corp., which already ships oil by-rail to its Anacortes, Washington refinery, is seeking approval for a 360,000 barrel per day facility in Vancouver, Washington, population 165,000. It faces a months-long delay during a state environmental review. Its approval rests with Democratic Governor Jay Inslee, who has not taken a position on the project.Tesoro has participated in more than 100 community meetings, a company spokeswoman said, adding that the project would boost energy independence and create hundreds of jobs.Further north in Washington's Grays Harbor County, fishermen, tribal groups and environmentalists oppose plans by three firms to inaugurate oil-by-rail terminals. Their proposed sites are on an estuary in an earthquake zone, opponents say.Three trains carrying grain have derailed in the county since late April, prompting a Federal Railroad Administration probe.""We got lucky this time,"" said Arthur Grunbaum of the Friends of Grays Harbor group. ""We won't be if crude oil is permitted.""Ed Johnstone, a fisherman who represents the Quinault Indian Nation on policy matters, said that allowing oil-trains would violate the Quinaults' land rights treaty. They have appealed to federal officials to nix the projects.With each new derailment, the opposition to oil trains is coalescing, said Diana Bailey of the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the leading national environmental groups and a major opponent of Keystone XL.""It's no longer 'not in my backyard.' Now it's 'not in anyone's backyard,'"" she said. (Reporting by Joshua Schneyer in Albany, New York; Rory Carroll in Vancouver, Washington; and Richard Valdmanis in St. John, New Brunswick.
