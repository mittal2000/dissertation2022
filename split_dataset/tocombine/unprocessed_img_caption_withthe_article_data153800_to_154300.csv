""Why are all the women I attract unavailable?"" There are two issues that often contribute to this situation.",2013-05-25,Group of friends toasting during an italian aperitif. The rays of sunset penatrate from open door.?http://www.massimomerlini.it/is/lifestyles.jpg,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2dc62100003000c56a58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I hear it over and over: ""Are there any available men?"" ""Why are all the women I attract unavailable?""Laura asked me the following:I find that I attract men who are unavailable. I meet nice men who are fun to be around, but when it comes to becoming serious they always say, ""I'm not ready right now."" What is it within me or that I need to seek out within myself to find out why I attract men who act like they want a relationship, but always say they are not ready? Could you give me insight on what I need to do to attract a loving mate and not unavailable men?There are two issues that often contribute to this situation. 1. Often, when a person consistently attracts unavailable people, it is because there is some unconscious fear of rejection and/or fear of engulfment that may actually be causing you to be unavailable -- even though you believe you are available.Since people attract each other at their common level of woundedness or their common level of health, an unavailable person's fear of commitment likely mirrors your fear of commitment. If you are a person who keeps meeting unavailable people, you might want to honestly look within to see if your fears of rejection or fears of engulfment (losing the other or losing yourself) may be causing you to be unavailable.It's easy to believe you are open and available, and that others are unavailable, but this is often not the case at all. If you are afraid of commitment, then it might unconsciously feel safe to you to be in a relationship with someone who you know is unavailable. Often, people who fear commitment -- due to their fear of rejection/engulfment -- are attracted to married people. Being in a relationship with an unavailable married person might actually feel safe to them! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who didn't want to commit, and then you broke up with him or her because of it, only to hear that he or she got married not long after your breakup? If so, it is easy to see that something else was going on there. What was going on may have to do with the second issue.  2. The second issue is that you may be abandoning yourself when you get into a relationship. If, when you really like someone, you make the other responsible for your feelings of lovability, security and worth, then the other's fear of engulfment and resulting resistance might get triggered. Self-abandonment is a key issue in creating relationship problems. If you are abandoning yourself by not taking responsibility for your own feelings of safety and self-worth, and you then make the other responsible for making you feel okay, he or she will likely experience you as needy -- and this might scare them. Self-abandonment becomes a pull on the other person to make you okay, and many people get scared when they feel pulled on. Their fear of losing themselves and being controlled by your neediness might become a big issue. They might go into major resistance to being open with you.Often, a person with a fear of rejection attracts a person with a fear of engulfment. If you have a fear of rejection -- because of rejecting and abandoning yourself -- then you may try to control in order to not be rejected when you are in a relationship. Your controlling behavior may trigger the other's fear of engulfment -- because he or she doesn't know how to not abandon themselves when being pulled at and demanded of. Because they have never learned how to take responsibility for themselves and their own feelings, and they may feel responsible for your feelings, they do the only thing they know to feel safe -- withdraw and resist. If you really want a relationship and you keep attracting unavailable people, then you need to do your own inner work to heal your fear of rejection and/or your fear of engulfment.

1,WELLNESS,The Paradox of Dying Lonely and Living in Solitude,"Arzu Kaya Uranli, Contributor
Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/loneliness-health_us_5b9d2fa9e4b03a1dcc855394,"We should remember that loneliness is the pain of being alone, yet solitude is the splendor of being alone, and that to have long-lasting happiness we should remember the difference in between.",2013-05-25,"Vietnam, Ninh Binh Province, Ken Ga, karstic landscape around Hoa Lu, woman on bicyccle on a dike",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2fa92100005100c56b13.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Loneliness is a seriously increasing problem of our time. Being lonely doesn't mean being alone. We are lonelier in wrong relationships than being by ourselves.Sometimes many of us feel like walking alone while we are surrounded by a big crowd. The quantity of social interaction doesn't matter, but rather the quality of it.According to psychologists, loneliness is a damaging state of mind and can also be a symptom of a psychological disorder such as depression. It is a universal human emotion. It makes us feel empty, alone and even unwanted. John Cacioppo, a social psychologist at the University of Chicago, found in a study that loneliness has many negative effects on both physical and mental health, such as cardiovascular disease and strokes, increased stress levels, reduced memory and learning, alcoholism and drug abuse, and more.Some researchers suggest that loneliness is becoming more common by living alone. Amanda Gardner indicated on CNN in March that:... in a study of nearly 3,500 men and women ages 30 to 65, researchers in Finland found that people who lived alone were more likely [than] their peers to receive a prescription for antidepressant drugs. One quarter of people living alone filled an antidepressant prescription during the seven-year study, compared to just 16 percent of those who lived with spouses, family, or roommates. Another study by Cacioppo claims that ""loneliness can be contagious."" A 10-year study found that loneliness spreads in social networks. Fifty-two percent of the people who were close to someone experiencing loneliness were more likely to become lonely as well.However, since it is complex and unique to each individual, psychology doesn't have any common preventions or treatments for loneliness.When I was researching this article, I realized that there are plenty of songs and poems about loneliness. They are maybe as many as love songs. And they give good clues about it.Life without a true friend and/or a loved one can be extremely lonely. To stop loneliness from sneaking into our life we should be brave and open the doors of our heart because we feel lonely when we don't feel connected to others.Technology is responsible for loneliness, too. With our cell phones and gadgets with the power of social media, we are able to embrace the whole world easily while neglecting our loved ones near us. So we should be very careful when determining our priorities.About a year ago I read an article in the LA Times about an old movie star's terrifying death. The name of the article is enough to explain why I was furious when I read it: ""Mummified body of former Playboy playmate Yvette Vickers found in her Benedict Canyon home."" The piece said, ""Her body appears to have gone undiscovered for months"" and, ""To the end she still got cards and letters from all over the world requesting photos and still wanting to be her friend."" Being famous is also a risk factor for being lonely. It seems like you cannot develop a good relationship but only shallow ones. Vickers' phone bills are proof to support that idea. In May, a noteworthy article in the Atlantic magazine claimed that Facebook makes us lonelier and indicated that ""[s]he had made calls not to friends or family but to distant fans who had found her through fan conventions and Internet sites.""Vickers' horrible end can happen to anybody while our Web connections go broader and our companionship gets more superficial. Nowadays, our paradox is living isolated but accessible. Yet within this world of instant and limitless communication, with endless time or space, we experience a unique alienation and become more detached from one another. Thus, we have become a less real society. It's ironic, but the more connected we become, the more lonesome we are.Feeling alone makes us miserable and vulnerable. However, an independent adult can live alone happily and in solitude. That is a natural need for an intelligent, educated individual. Thus, we are unprecedentedly happy when we are in solitude. In some cases crowded parties can be agony, yet solitude can be divine. For many of us, protecting our solitude helps us to connect with God, and that connection is also an invincible enemy of loneliness. However, separated from the world, we voluntarily live in the shell of our solitude like a cocoon, then end up complaining how lonely we have become. We should remember that loneliness is the pain of being alone, yet solitude is the splendor of being alone, and that to have long-lasting happiness we should remember the difference in between.This article previously was published in Today's Zaman.For more by Arzu Kaya-Uranli, click here.

2,CRIME,Missing Person Searches: French Authorities Won't Look For Missing Adults Anymore,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/france-missing-persons_us_5ba2bea8e4b0c2784da56a3f,HuffPost Crime thanks Tanay Tewani for translating research materials for this article. “It saddens me to learn that the,2013-05-25,"Policemen are gathered on May 20, 2013 in Villiers-sur-Marne, outside Paris, to attend a ceremony to pay tribute to Aurelie Fouquet, a municipal policewoman who died in a shooting with a heavily armed commando on May 20, 2012. Hit by three bullets, Aurelie Fouquet, 26, and mother of a fourteen-month-old boy, succumbed to her injuries after being hospitalized. AFP PHOTO / FRED DUFOUR (Photo credit should read FRED DUFOUR/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2bea83c00009e000af54f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Missing in France? Don’t expect police to come looking.Though the United States and Canada have bolstered their missing person organizations with the help of the Internet, France has suddenly taken a step in the opposite direction. Law enforcement agencies in the country have ended missing person's searches for adults.The news came in the form of a press release that was posted earlier this week to a government website.“Taking into account the development of means of telecommunications and in particular the Internet, the number of [requests] … in the interest of families has considerably dropped these last years, such that this [system has essentially devolved],” wrote Laurent Touvetthe, Director of Legal and Administrative Information for the Prime Minister’s office.As a result of the change, authorities will no longer search for adults who have been reported missing by family members. The changes took effect on Friday.The only exception to the rule is minors, individuals who have expressed a desire to commit suicide, and cases in which there is a clear indication that the victim disappeared as a result of foul play.According to Cabinet Martin, a private detective agency in Cannes, approximately 15,000 people disappear each year without trace in France. The number of those recovered each year is not known, but with the new policy in effect the number of those recovered will likely decrease.“It saddens me to learn that the authorities in France are taking a step backward in their work to resolve missing person cases,” Kelly Murphy, founder of the Omaha, Nebraska-based Project Jason, told The Huffington Post.Project Jason offers resources to families of the missing and has successfully organized grassroots efforts to pass missing-persons legislation.Murphy started Project Jason after her 19-year-old son, Jason Jolkowski, disappeared in June 2001. He remains missing today.“We understand the difficulty in conducting a full and proper investigation with the number of cases, but I believe they're not looking at the whole picture,” said Murphy, who, in 2010, was presented with the Volunteer for Victims award in Washington, D.C. by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.“It's not always evident that a missing person may have been the victim of a crime,” Murphy continued. “When the case is not investigated and then solved, the perpetrator will likely go on to commit other crimes, creating even more work for law enforcement and impacting more lives. Besides that, families are suffering daily without answers. It's traumatic to deal with ambiguous loss, and this leaves those families with a huge gap in their ability to retain hope since this avenue of assistance has been closed to them.”HuffPost Crime thanks Tanay Tewani for translating research materials for this article."
3,BUSINESS,Paul Krugman: Conservative Movement Allows 'No Room For Independent Thinking',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-krugman-conservative-movement_us_5bb2f5efe4b0480ca65f98e0,"“There remains essentially no room for independent thinking within the conservative movement,” Krugman wrote. “Being a good",2013-05-25,"Nobel Prize-winning Economist Paul Krugman, professor of international trade and economics at Princeton University, speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, U.S., on Monday, Jan. 28, 2013. Krugman discussed the performance of bonds, Fed monetary policy, and the U.S. economy compared with that of Japan. Photographer: Scott Eells/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2f5ef240000500055b6b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Holding on to the conservative label can be tough, especially if you have your own ideas that counter the mainstream, according to Paul Krugman. The Nobel Prize-winning economist wrote in a blog post Saturday that people who identify as conservative, but take stances opposing the conservative mainstream -- acknowledging the connection between humans and global warming, opposing austerity and favoring tax increases, for example -- often find themselves disowned by the conservative movement. “There remains essentially no room for independent thinking within the conservative movement,” Krugman wrote. “Being a good liberal doesn’t require that you believe, or pretend to believe, lots of things that almost certainly aren’t true; being a good conservative does,” he went on to say. Krugman has written before that there are some issues in which there is little room for debate because the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of one side, and yet conservatives continue to argue in favor of the opposite. In one example, he responded to critics of his stance against government belt-tightening, who argue that he’s cherry-picking facts to make his case, by writing “maybe I actually am right,” in an April blog post. And more people may be starting to take up Krugman's anti-austerity stance. The evidence against austerity is in fact so overwhelming that a few conservatives have voiced their opposition. But as Krugman and New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait note, the most outspoken critics like conservative Bloomberg columnist Josh Barro have had to pay the price, becoming disavowed by the movement as a whole. What the conservative critics of the reformists within their ranks may be surprised to learn though, is that some of their very idols went against the dogma they’re espousing today. Former British Prime Minister and conservative icon Margaret Thatcher actually raised taxes, violating a major tenet of the current conservative movement. In fact, taxes as a share of the economy increased during her tenure. In addition, former President Ronald Reagan, a GOP hero, enacted the largest tax increase in four decades, according to Joseph J. Thorndike, the director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analyst. Reagan was able to obscure the increases though by giving them a different name: “revenue enhancements,” which came from closing loopholes in the tax code. "

The remainder of the funding will come from movie investment company Worldview Entertainment, which kicked in the balance in a deal made at the Cannes Film Festival. The movie boasts a cast that includes Kate Hudson, Mandy Patinkin, Josh Gad, Anna Kendrick, Jim Pasons and fellow ""Scrubs"" star Donald Faison.Despite Braff's decided success, the Kickstarter endeavor has seemed to garner as many detractors as it has supporters. Some are left wondering whether an A-list celebrity should be entitled to crowd-funding efforts when burgeoning artists are struggling to support their own. This week's Ethicist column in The New York Times Magazine even takes on whether Braff's use of crowd funding is ethical.Braff has responded in a variety of ways to these arguments, including a video he filmed for the ""Kickstarted"" series and a Sirius XM radio interview in which he addressed the negative feedback. ""Artists are super into it, and I'm letting that outweigh the voice of angry bloggers,"" he said during the interview."
