I can't say that yet. Because I don't see it.”What Trump doesn’t see, according to himself, is not winning the Republican presidential nomination. He stated that he’s leading in the polls nationally and in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and so he doesn’t need to think about a third-party bid.If Trump were “mistreated” by the Republican Party, however, he says that he could still launch an independent bid.When asked whether he could foresee a situation where he lost the nomination and was treated fairly, Trump stated, “Yes, there is. And there's also a way I could lose the nomination and feel that I was treated unfairly by the Republican Party.”Currently, though, Trump has no opinion on how the party is treating him.“Right now, I have no opinion,” he said. “I just know that I'm winning by a lot. I really have no opinion.”Also on HuffPost:"

Did you notice the media forgot all about another story's basic facts? Tweet @TheWorldPost or let us know on our Facebook page.A Russian passenger jet exploded in midair over Egypt’s Sinai peninsula almost one month ago, plunging 224 people on board to their deaths. It was the worst aviation disaster in Russian history and the deadliest terrorist attack targeting Russians in over a decade. Yet many Russians know little about the victims of Metrojet Flight 9268. Russian authorities released the passenger manifest -- which included 209 Russian citizens and at least 25 children -- but their personal stories have not been widely covered in the Russian press.“It’s shocking in comparison to when tragedies happen in Western countries, when there are photos of the victims and comments on social media,” said Tonia Samsonova. Samsonova is a founder of Russian-language social network The Question and a U.K.-based correspondent for the Echo of Moscow, regarded as Russia's most liberal radio station.The lack of coverage has repercussions on public perceptions of the tragedy, said Valery Nechay, a Russia-based journalist for the station.“People become more involved in the story when they know the images and stories, and not just a number -- 224 victims,” he told The WorldPost.The so-called Islamic State extremist group said it had planted a bomb on the plane in retaliation for Russian intervention into the Syrian war since September, a claim deemed credible by Western officials, to the chagrin of the Kremlin. Initially, Russian and Egyptian authorities cautioned that mechanical defects or pilot error or pilot error could be to blame.When Russia's FSB security services acknowledged two weeks later that the plane had been bombed, much of the public debate had already moved on. “In the first days [after the plane went down], everyone was discussing the company Metrojet and its subsidiary Kogalymavia, and trying to figure out who is responsible,” Samsonova said. “There was no question as to whether it was true or not. It was totally unthinkable that ISIS could be a real threat to us,” she said.“By the time people realized it was a terrorist attack, the grief had passed.”The grief, of course, has just begun for the families of the victims. Yet few journalists have spoken to the Metrojet relatives and they have been mostly absent from public discussions about the attack and its repercussions. According to several analysts, this is partly a reflection of the government's concerns. Much of Russia's media is owned or heavily influenced by the Kremlin and its allies. ""State-oriented media don't want people to think about"" the Metrojet disaster, Samsonova said.The relative lack of coverage also reflects a certain amount of compassion fatigue in Putin's Russia, where economic turmoil has fueled rising poverty levels, the Kremlin has cracked down on activists and journalists and ratcheted up tensions overseas, from neighboring Ukraine to the United States. ""In Russia, terrible things happen every day,"" Samsonova said. ""People are more concerned with the declining living standards and coping with the constant state of tension.""There are glimpses of discontent amongst the Metrojet victims' families. Some relatives have complained they are being kept in the dark over the details of the Russian-Egyptian Metrojet investigation.Nechay, who spoke to several families of the victims, said many do not trust the government. They are primarily concerned with receiving formal identification of their loved ones's remains and securing the compensation pledged by the government.Most are too consumed by their loss to think much more about the government’s investigation, he said. “If it was a mechanical problem, or not, it won’t change their situation,” Nechay said.Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane on Tuesday, which killed a pilot and a Russian marine deployed on a rescue mission, has similarly failed to shift media attention to the human cost of Russia's war in Syria.The downing has sparked widespread outrage in Russia, but the threat of a military confrontation has overshadowed of the military deaths themselves, said Ruslan Leviev, an investigative blogger who has tracked Russian military involvement in Syria and Ukraine. The slain marine received a military funeral this week, but it was hardly covered by the Russian press, he said. There was some criticism of Putin on social media when he didn't send condolences to the slain pilot's family in the first message he issued after the plane downing this week, Nechay said. Putin did send his condolences a few days later.Overall, Russian military families have shown much less vocal opposition to the intervention in Syria than to the divisive Russian campaign in Ukraine, according to Leviev. “While this mission [in Syria] already has claimed lives of our soldiers, the relatives say this is part of the job and a risk they take willingly,” he said.And while some analysts suggested the Metrojet disaster might dent broader support for Russian involvement in the war in Syria, polls by the independent Moscow-based Levada Center appear to show that public opinion has remained largely constant -- and mostly supportive.Also on HuffPost:"

The terrorist was shot and killed at the scene,” Israeli police spokesperson Mickey Rosenfeld said.Almost daily Palestinian stabbings, car rammings and shootings have killed 19 Israelis and one U.S. citizen since October 1.Israeli forces have killed 94 Palestinians, many of whom were carrying out assaults and others in clashes with police and troops. Many of those killed have been teenagers.Palestinian allegations that Israel was trying to alter the religious status quo at a Jerusalem holy site, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, where al-Aqsa mosque stands, and to Jews as the Temple Mount, have partly fuelled the violence.Non-Muslim prayer is banned around al-Aqsa and Israel has said it will not change that. But more visits in recent years by Jewish religious activists and ultra-nationalist Israeli politicians to the complex, where two biblical temples once stood, have done little to convince the Palestinians.Overnight in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, Israeli forces shut down and confiscated equipment from a Palestinian radio station, the third in recent weeks, that the military said, ""has repeatedly broadcasted content which promotes and encourages terror and acts of violence against Israeli civilians and security forces.""The station owner, Talab al-Jabar, told Reuters that the broadcaster, called Dream, was not inciting, rather reporting on events.""They want to shut down the free voice and to shut down the Palestinian media. In their statement they say that we are radios that incite people, if they see that we are inciting when we cover everything they do against our Palestinian nation so we are inciting. I can tell you that 'Dream' radio will be back on air very soon and it will be stronger,"" he said.A flash visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories by U.S. Secretary John Kerry last week, aimed at quelling the violence, has not shown any sign of success."

Abortion clinics have long been the targets of violence, including bombings, anthrax scares and mass blockades. This year alone, arsonists attacked four Planned Parenthood clinics in Washington, California, Illinois and Louisiana. In October, NARAL Pro-Choice America launched a petition urging the FBI to investigate the arson attacks, stating that “they’re perpetrated by an extreme minority that’s committed to ruling through fear and intimidation” and urging the FBI to treat them with the gravity warranted by domestic terrorism.“We can’t wait until one more patient, doctor or nurse is hurt or killed before we say enough is enough. It’s time for an investigation to get to the bottom of this,” the group said. Attacks on clinics are not always violent, though they are often threatening, designed to sow fear and to make it harder for abortion providers and clinic workers to do their jobs. In Living in the Crosshairs: The Untold Stories of Anti-Abortion Terrorism, David S. Cohen and Krysten Connen detail the many ways in which clinics have been attacked or threatened in the last several decades:Extremists have also thrown butyric acid into clinics, glued clinic locks shut, locked themselves into clinic property using items such as bicycle locks or chains, drilled holes into clinic roofs so that the clinic floods, invaded clinics, vandalized clinics, made threatening phone calls, tried to persuade patients to go to fake clinics, put spikes in driveways, talked outside clinics about bomb-making chemicals, laid down on sidewalks, jumped on cars, camped out in front of clinics for multiple-day stretches, and sent decoy patients into clinics to disrupt business.Cohen told The Huffington Post that Friday’s shooting was on the extreme end of the obstacles that abortion providers and clinic workers face on a daily basis. “The normal part of being an abortion provider is living an working in fear, and today is an example of why,” he said. “Thankfully these things don’t happen every day but they do happen, and because they happen, abortion providers have to live their lives and go to work knowing that they’re in danger.”One of the most high-profile examples of violence against an abortion provider is the 2009 murder of Dr. George Tiller in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller’s clinic had been the target of numerous acts of sabotage and violence, including a shooting in which Tiller was hit in both arms.Cohen also noted that if some of the people who were wounded in the Colorado Springs shooting were patients, then the attack represents a shift in anti-abortion violence. On Saturday night, police were unwilling to ascribe a clear anti-abortion motive to Dear's actions, but multiple officials familiar with the investigation described the attack as politically motivated.“The patients have suffered from blockades and from being harassed by protestors, but this is new,” he said. “If it is true that it’s patients that are being injured, this is new.” He compared the day’s events to the 1998 bombing of an Alabama abortion clinic; that attack also occurred while the clinic was seeing patients, and was timed for when the clinic opened in the morning.Though Cohen would not reveal if he had interviewed abortion providers or clinic workers from the Colorado Springs clinic for his book, he described the climate in which they practice reproductive health care.“It’s a very conservative part of Colorado, and Colorado has some very extreme anti-abortion folks,” he said. This most recent attack happened against a backdrop of increased hostility against Planned Parenthood, the result of a series of undercover videos that purport to show Planned Parenthood employees discussing the sale of fetal tissue.

8,CRIME,Colorado Planned Parenthood Shooting Is Part Of A Frightening Trend,Chloe Angyal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colorado-planned-parenthood-shooting_us_5658f9b1e4b072e9d1c1f5b6,Is this the next stage of anti-abortion violence in America?,2015-11-29,"An unidentified victim is transported into an ambulance after a gunman opened fire at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Friday. The attack was one of several against Planned Parenthood clinics this year.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5659038721000065005abbc4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A gunman opened fire in a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Friday, the latest in a string of attacks at the health care provider's clinics this year.Robert Lewis Dear, 57, who surrendered to authorities after an hourslong standoff, appears to have been motivated by opposition to abortion. Abortion clinics have long been the targets of violence, including bombings, anthrax scares and mass blockades. This year alone, arsonists attacked four Planned Parenthood clinics in Washington, California, Illinois and Louisiana. In October, NARAL Pro-Choice America launched a petition urging the FBI to investigate the arson attacks, stating that “they’re perpetrated by an extreme minority that’s committed to ruling through fear and intimidation” and urging the FBI to treat them with the gravity warranted by domestic terrorism.“We can’t wait until one more patient, doctor or nurse is hurt or killed before we say enough is enough. It’s time for an investigation to get to the bottom of this,” the group said. Attacks on clinics are not always violent, though they are often threatening, designed to sow fear and to make it harder for abortion providers and clinic workers to do their jobs. In Living in the Crosshairs: The Untold Stories of Anti-Abortion Terrorism, David S. Cohen and Krysten Connen detail the many ways in which clinics have been attacked or threatened in the last several decades:Extremists have also thrown butyric acid into clinics, glued clinic locks shut, locked themselves into clinic property using items such as bicycle locks or chains, drilled holes into clinic roofs so that the clinic floods, invaded clinics, vandalized clinics, made threatening phone calls, tried to persuade patients to go to fake clinics, put spikes in driveways, talked outside clinics about bomb-making chemicals, laid down on sidewalks, jumped on cars, camped out in front of clinics for multiple-day stretches, and sent decoy patients into clinics to disrupt business.Cohen told The Huffington Post that Friday’s shooting was on the extreme end of the obstacles that abortion providers and clinic workers face on a daily basis. “The normal part of being an abortion provider is living an working in fear, and today is an example of why,” he said. “Thankfully these things don’t happen every day but they do happen, and because they happen, abortion providers have to live their lives and go to work knowing that they’re in danger.”One of the most high-profile examples of violence against an abortion provider is the 2009 murder of Dr. George Tiller in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller’s clinic had been the target of numerous acts of sabotage and violence, including a shooting in which Tiller was hit in both arms.Cohen also noted that if some of the people who were wounded in the Colorado Springs shooting were patients, then the attack represents a shift in anti-abortion violence. On Saturday night, police were unwilling to ascribe a clear anti-abortion motive to Dear's actions, but multiple officials familiar with the investigation described the attack as politically motivated.“The patients have suffered from blockades and from being harassed by protestors, but this is new,” he said. “If it is true that it’s patients that are being injured, this is new.” He compared the day’s events to the 1998 bombing of an Alabama abortion clinic; that attack also occurred while the clinic was seeing patients, and was timed for when the clinic opened in the morning.Though Cohen would not reveal if he had interviewed abortion providers or clinic workers from the Colorado Springs clinic for his book, he described the climate in which they practice reproductive health care.“It’s a very conservative part of Colorado, and Colorado has some very extreme anti-abortion folks,” he said. This most recent attack happened against a backdrop of increased hostility against Planned Parenthood, the result of a series of undercover videos that purport to show Planned Parenthood employees discussing the sale of fetal tissue. The videos have triggered renewed calls for the organization to be defunded, as well as a five-hour grilling of Planned Parenthood President and CEO Cecile Richards by a congressional select committee.Friday's shooting left one police officer and two civilians dead. “To think that this is medical care in 2015 in the U.S. is horrifying,” Cohen said. “This is how terrorism works. These incidents don’t happen often, but when they do, they make people fear for their lives.”"

The billionaire eccentric candidate's story continued to dissemble in his defense. He waffled between whether it was “thousands” or “hundreds” and whether it was in “Paterson” or “Jersey City” in New Jersey before settling on the simple explanation, “Why wouldn't it have taken place?”Trump’s lie about thousands of Muslim Americans celebrating the 9/11 attacks came as part of an explanation for why the country should target Muslim communities in the United States with discriminatory policies like religion-specific surveillance, the closure of mosques and the creation of a federal database to track Muslim Americans. At a Nov. 21 rally in Alabama, he told the crowd, “I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering. So something’s going on. We’ve got to find out what it is.”On “Meet the Press,” Trump changed the total number of people he claims to have seen celebrate: “Chuck, I saw it on television. So did many other people. And many --many people. I said hundreds.”Trump then changed the location for his claim. “I heard Paterson. Excuse me. I've heard Jersey City. I've heard Paterson,” he said. “It was 14 years ago. But I saw it on television.”To bolster his claim, Trump marshaled the support he’s received over Twitter and by phone calls to his company backing up the fictitious event.“Hundreds of people have confirmed it. You look at @realdonaldtrump, where I have millions and millions of people on there, between Facebook and Twitter. I have 10 million people between the two of them. You look at that. And I'm getting unbelievable response of people that said they saw it,” Trump said.As previously reported by Politifact, The Washington Post, The New York Times and FactCheck.org, there is no evidence that Trump’s remembered celebrations took place. The only footage of post-9/11 celebrations was a video of a small group of Palestinian teens seen celebrating in East Jerusalem. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter whether the celebrations were by hundreds or thousands or in Paterson or Jersey City. Since a celebration was recorded somewhere, as shown in The Associated Press footage from East Jerusalem, Trump simply claims that if it happened there it must have happened here.“When the Trade Center came down, it was done all around the world,” Trump said. “And you know that because that has been reported very strongly. Why wouldn't it have taken place?”"

A: I went up to Paisley Park to jam with Prince. At the time, there was no real plan to make a record. But then I played him some of my songs and we began working on arrangements. Both of us were so excited about how great the arrangements sounded! So we decided to record it. It took about three weeks to actually complete all the work. It was a very quick and fun process.   Q: How did the opportunity to work with Prince come about? A: He reached out to me after seeing a TV interview where I said I'd love to work with him. I got a personal call from him, which was crazy! That was the beginning of the adventure.   Q: What surprised you the most about him? A: I'm surprised and impressed by how prolific he is. He can write lyrics in five minutes. Ideas just flow out of him constantly. Songs are written every day and records are being made all the time. He's a hit factory.   Q: Had you followed his music very much over the years? A: Yes, I've been a big fan of his since I was really young. My dad was the first to introduce me to Prince's music. In our household, we celebrate all funksters. But, Prince is special because of his unique sound and fresh take on funk music.  Q: Who would you say your greatest influence has been musically? A: I would say Aretha Franklin is my greatest influence. As a singer, I love her phrasing and storytelling when she sings melodies. And I could relate to her tone...it's powerful but has a very light weight quality that soars. I love to use this as a model for my voice because I have a similar timbre.   Q: You are bi-racial and bi-cultural. How have you been influenced by Japanese and African-American cultures? A: I love listening to traditional Japanese music and instruments. I've always been fascinated and deeply connected to ancient and exotic musical traditions. Every time I go to Japan, I find a deep sense of serenity and comfort as if it is a distant homeland I've always known. And, of course, I grew up around gospel and soul music. I would say I identify with my African American side a little stronger since I was born in America and have always seen my dad's family a little more.   Q: Have you followed the story of Miss Japan. Any thoughts on the struggles she's endured? A: I was very moved by her story. It's sad to see people criticize her mixed race rather than celebrate it. Japan is a unique place. Though it embraces so many cultures and traditions, especially musically, there are strict rules and social norms that are heavily placed on Japanese people. They welcome outsiders but are hard on their own. My mother would always share her struggles with this being Japanese. When I go there, they view me as American. When they find out I am half-Japanese they are a bit surprised. If I was born in Japan, I'm sure my experience would be similar to Miss Japan.  Q: What do you want people to take away from your music? A: I want people to feel like they can always go ""Back In Time"" when they need a good old classic soul jam. The album is filled with so many funky grooves and catchy hooks. I hope it contributes to many dance parties and road trips.   Q: Is there a theme or thread that runs through your songs? A: With songs like ""Cry, Cry, Cry"", ""Angel In The Dark"", and ""Beautiful Life"", there is a reoccurring theme about persevering through hard times. I also celebrate my family and community with ""My People"" ""Turn Up"" and ""Jammin' In The Basement"". Lastly, I speak heavily about the race issues and police brutality we have been facing in America recently. ""As Trains Go By"" is a powerful statement about such things.   Q: You sang at Andrae Crouch's memorial service. Were you a fan?  A: Andrae Crouch was someone I always admired and would see from time to time as my parents worked with him. He was one of the best songwriters of our time. His music is so simple yet cutting to the heart. I was deeply moved to see all my friends and legendary gospel singers celebrate his legacy at the service. It's amazing to hear all the songs we know and realize, ""Andrae wrote that too!!!""  Q: Do you have any plans to tour? A: Yes, my tour will start next month and continue into the new year. I'm working on new music and expanding my arrangements for full orchestras. I will be including orchestra shows next year in my tour. It's been very exciting taking soul music to the concert halls and hearing big string and horn sections enhance the experience.   Q: Any acting plans? A: Not at the moment."

The front consisted of a series of largely separate campaigns. It began with the Serbian Campaign, first between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, and then a second Serbian Campaign that saw Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria both invade Serbia. It expanded to include the Romanian and Bulgarian campaigns as well as the largely independent Italian campaign in the Trentino and Alto Adige. Eventually the various campaigns all coalesced around what came to be called the Macedonian or Salonika Front. In the process it drew in both Greece and Romania on the Allied side and Bulgaria on the side of the Central Powers. In addition, the major combatants, Great Britain, France, and Austria-Hungary and, to a lesser extent, Italy, the Ottomans and Germany, all contributed significant numbers of troops to the forces arrayed on the Macedonian Front.Ostensibly, the purpose of the Balkan campaign was to sever the Berlin to Constantinople railway and to cut off the Ottoman Empire from support by either Austria-Hungary or Germany. A secondary consideration was to relieve pressure on Russia on the Eastern front by tying up large numbers of Austrian-Hungarian troops in the Balkans. Finally, in the event of a dual breakout on both the Balkan and Eastern Fronts, the two Allied armies would be able to encircle the Austrian-Hungarian armies in a broad enveloping movement and destroy them. In reality none of these objectives came to pass and the Balkan Front became yet another stalemate between the Allied and the Central Powers.The Serbian front saw the first outbreak of conflict in World War I when Austrian artillery shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade. The subsequent Austrian-Hungarian invasion of Serbia was repulsed by the Serbs, which gave the Allies their first battlefield victory of the war. A joint Austrian and Bulgarian campaign in 1915 saw Serbia again invaded, this time from both the north and the east. Against the renewed onslaught, the Serbian Army steadily retreated eventually making its way to the Albanian port of Durazzo where they were evacuated by a joint British and French task force. After additional training and rearmament they were deployed in Macedonia where they participated in the Macedonian/Salonika campaign. Bulgarian campaign, Balkan Front 1915-1918  In 1914 Romania had been formally allied with Austria-Hungary, but when war broke out the Bucharest government had declared its neutrality. Over the summer of 1916, in response to inducements by Great Britain and France that they would support the Romanian annexation of Transylvania from Austria-Hungary, as well as in response to long standing enmity between Romania and Bulgaria, Romania joined the war on the Allied side. The war proved to be a total disaster for Romania. Between August and the end of December 1916, a combined Austrian-Hungarian, German, Bulgarian, and Ottoman force had overrun the regions of Wallachia and Dobruja. More than half of the Romanian army had been captured and an unspecified number killed.Following retraining under a French Expeditionary force commanded by General Henri Berthelot a resupplied Romanian Army, supported by elements of the now disintegrating Russian Army, were able to contain the German drive on Moldova in 1917. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the German advance into the Ukraine left Romania entirely surrounded by the military forces of the Central Powers. Facing certain destruction, the Bucharest government signed the Treaty of Bucharest in 1918 and withdrew from further involvement in World War I. Following the successful offensive on the Macedonian Front that knocked Bulgaria out of the war, Romanian reentered the war of the Allied side on November 10, 1918; one day before the general armistice was announced.Italian forces had intervened in the Balkans even before Italy's entry in World War I. In December 1914, Italy had occupied the port of Vlore in Albania. After it entered the war, Italy expanded its occupation to include southern Albania and northern Epirus. It also organized an army of Albanian irregulars to supplement its own forces. Additionally, the Italians contributed troops to the joint Allied force on the Macedonian front.In the northeast, Italian forces fought a series of bloody battles to seize the Isonzo River and advance into Dalmatia. Italian troops continued their campaign even after the Armistice was announced on November 11. They finally stopped on November 18 with the seizure the city of Fiume and promptly announced, in accordance with the provisions of the 1915 London Treaty, that they were annexing this newly conquered region of Dalmatia.  Serbian troops marching to the front line against the Austrians  Bulgaria had historically been at war with the Ottoman Empire and closely allied with Russia. Disappointed at the lack of Russian support during the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, Bulgaria gradually moved closer to the Central Powers even if that meant it was now allied with the Ottomans, their traditional enemy. The historical rivalry with Constantinople notwithstanding, Sofia now had more substantial claims over the predominantly Bulgarian populated territories in Serbia, Greece, and Romania, all three of which were now aligned with Great Britain and France. Bulgaria, which already had the largest army in the Balkans, scored a quick series of battlefield triumphs, occupying much of southern Serbia, taking the region of Dobruja from Romania, and advancing into Greek Macedonia. Bulgarian popular support for the war waned rapidly, however, as a result of the extreme economic dislocations caused by the fighting. The Russian Revolution in February 1917 ignited similar sentiments in Bulgaria spreading antiwar and anti-monarchial support among the military and civilian population.In 1915, in response to the collapse of Serbian forces against the combined Bulgarian and Austrian-Hungarian offensives, a joint British-French-Italian force had landed at Salonika, modern day Thessaloniki, to reinforce Serbian forces as well as to establish a base of operations against pro-German Bulgaria. Reinforced by the remnants of the Serbian Army, as well as troops withdrawn from the Allied campaign in Gallipoli, the new front stabilized along the northern Greek border with Macedonia and was referred to as the Macedonian front, although the term Salonika front was used interchangeably.  Romanian troops on the march, November 1918  In September 1918, after a prolonged buildup, a joint Allied army consisting of a mix of Italian, British, French, Greek, and Serbian forces, under the command of French General Franchet d'Esperey, broke through along the Macedonian front and began to advance. Bulgarian forces stopped them in Dojran before they could physically occupy any historic Bulgarian territory. By October 1918 they had liberated Serbia and were poised to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted when the Hungarian government offered to surrender and by the subsequent Armistice of November 11. Notwithstanding the victory at Dojran, The Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace, however, and he agreed to abdicate in favor of his son Boris III. Under the treaty of Neuilly signed in November 1919, Bulgaria lost its Aegean coast (western Thrace) to Greece and nearly all of its Macedonian territory was incorporated into the new state of Yugoslavia. In addition it had to return Dobruja to Romania. The Balkan Front was a relatively minor theater of World War I. No epic battles were fought there, and there were no events that impacted the larger conduct of the war on either the Eastern or Western Fronts. The strategy of using it as a launching point for a general offensive into Austria-Hungary, and to coordinate the advance with a similar breakout of Russian troops on the Eastern front, was sound military logic, but after 1915, Russian troops on the Eastern front were unable to stage a broad breakout and the troop strength on the Macedonian front was never sufficient to stage their own breakout and create a credible pincer movement against Austrian-Hungarian forces until 1918. By then Russia was out of the war and the war on the Eastern Front had long since been settled."

For us children of the corn, Go Big Red is about something bigger than sports. This storied program - 4th most wins in Division I-A history, five national championships, three Heisman Trophy winners - is interwoven into our collective DNA. I was at the game on Friday, sitting in a $250 seat in 25-degree Nebraska weather (which felt like 9 degrees, due to strong winds). I was bundled up and, like so many Husker faithful, ready for the kill. Almost every player on Nebraska played with intensity, competence, and an unbridled drive to win. The fans were into it, and expressed their fire for victory loudly throughout. However, we were let down again in this season of close-game losses - as we have been so many times since the glory days of Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne - by our quarterback. Yes, the referees made some questionable calls that kept key Iowa drives alive. Moreover, our offensive play-calling was at times suspect. For example, with just over six minutes to go in the contest, on fourth-and-one, we threw a long fade route into the end zone (instead of running the ball, or kicking an easy field goal that would have put us within a touchdown and two-point conversion of tying the game) . But quarterback play trumped all that. You see, in Nebraska's new pro-style offense, great responsibility is placed on the quarterback (QB) to make quick, on-the-fly decisions among multiple split-second scenarios. If that QB is not a prudent decision-maker, then the whole complex system is for naught. Nebraska's Tommy Armstrong, Jr. is a horrible decision-maker, as he proved repeatedly against Iowa (with four interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown).The first order of off-season business for Husker Coach Mike Riley, if he intends to keep his job, is to immediately replace Armstrong. For all of Tommy's positive attributes (a strong arm, good rushing and scrambling ability), he is just not dependable. He throws when he should run. He throws into the field of play when he should throw the ball out of bounds. He throws when there are three or four defensive players guarding his intended receiver. And sometimes he just chucks it up and hopes for the best.The sad story is this: we've seen this horror show ever since Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch graduated Nebraska in 2002. Thirteen years of quarterback futility ensued. I blame most of this on the 2003 decision to fire Coach Frank Solich (the first NCAA college football coach ever fired after a 9-3 season), and a weird, uncharacteristic turn towards complicated West Coast offenses that don't fit the Great Plains personnel that Nebraska largely has, nor the hardscrabble weather extremes we experience here in the Heartland. If Nebraska is to right this ship, we first need to fire Mike Riley (who has been a losing coach four of the last six seasons he's coached, including this first year at Nebraska, and previous five at Oregon State, which cratered even further since his departure). Our goal after firing previous head coach Bo Pelini - ostensibly because of his sideline temper tantrums, even though he consistently won 9 games or more a year - should have been to hire a coach who could bring us back to the college football mountain top. Instead, we hired a ""nice"" even-keeled guy that seems constitutionally incapable of lighting a fire under anyone, including himself, and who has, as head coach, never won an American championship of any kind. Past performance is the best indicator of future behavior. And no matter what the personnel, Mike Riley over his tenure here - no matter how long it is - will likely be a .500 winning percentage coach, with one major yearly upset under his belt. That's who he is because that's who he's been. We can count on his mediocrity, just as surely as we can count on Tommy Armstrong remaining consistently inconsistent. As we say in debate circles, winners win. Losers find a way to lose. And at Nebraska we are now at risk of keeping a coach who is modeling how to lose. In Riley's place, we need to bring in a proven option-oriented winner, who will get the Corrnhuskers back to running over people for four quarters. With more time-consuming and yard-consuming run plays, our vaunted Blackshirts defense - which held Iowa to zero third down conversions - will get more rest and, thus, perform at an even higher level.

A Planned Parenthood in Colorado had been attacked and police were trying to verify reports of what was happening. ""Again?"" I asked myself. ""We're doing this again? The day after a national holiday?""I'm ashamed to be an American right now, to know that friends in need of reproductive health will shy away from Planned Parenthood after events like these. If one person is too afraid to seek medical help or consultation regarding their pregnancy, our ""city on a hill"" has already begun to break down. If we allow this to happen again, we have failed as a society of responsible individuals. This is not our future. As cliche as these phrase are by now - indeed I sigh just typing them - we cannot overlook the familiarity of events like the attack on Planned Parenthood. Getting back from the date, I immediately turned on the television to get an update on what had happened and was struck by the photo of Robert Lewis Dear. There's scant information law enforcement had collected on him was routine: 57. White. Three rifles. Had recently moved to Colorado from a North Carolina cabin without electricity of water. I think what struck me the most was how much he reminded me of one of my family members, even someone I had just spent Thanksgiving with. This family member - who makes it a point to loudly and publicly ""just tease"" me about my liberal politics - and I had just had a rather heated argument the day before on how ""somebody needs to do something to take back this country."" He said he ""understands"" people who bomb health clinics and that ""they're patriots."" When the defunding of Planned Parenthood took place earlier this year, he called me to tell me ""it wasn't enough"" and to reiterate ""someone needs to do something to stop these bitches."" So, when I say that the image on the news right now looks and sounds so familiar, it is because I - like so many others - have a Robert Lewis Dear in my family.Which is why it's time for us to stop being polite and keeping the peace in our families, to stop hiding behind sympathetic posts on social media and instead have hard discussions about where we, as families, are at. To tell those close to us how afraid we are that, some day, we might see their mugshot on television after a horrific event. To communicate with the strong voice of unity how ashamed we are of elected officials like Illinois's 16th Congressional District Representative, Adam Kinzinger (R) who leapt at the chance to make a name for himself by attacking Planned Parenthood and express sympathy for, even solidarity with, alleged killer and terrorist, Robert Lewis Dear. In an interview with CNN, Kinzinger criticized Planned Parenthood for ""escalating"" the shooting when they denounced ""extremists"" and the ""poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism."" Rep. Kinzinger demanded Planned Parenthood apologize for inspiring Dear to commit this heinous act, but in a very real sense, Planned Parenthood was pointing the finger at the Republican field of candidates who have, each and all, condemned their organization and made a case for relaxed gun laws and defunding of women's health, minimized domestic terrorism, participated in race-baiting, condemned the rulings of the Supreme Court on marriage equality, and aggressively incited nationalistic rhetoric that borders on ethnic supremacy.Robert Lewis Dear admitted Planned Parenthood was his intended target after he surrendered to Colorado Spring Police, but Rep. Kinzinger has not retracted his statements or his sympathy for Dear, who multiple witnesses claim ""stalked"" a man crawling through the parking lot. According to Julie Turkewitz, a reporter for The New York Times, ""He was focused on the medical clinic but indiscriminate with his targets, firing his long gun into the entryway before turning around and shooting through the windshield of the witness, a man who tried to flee after dropping off friends there."" Three people died at the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood on Friday. Nine were wounded, at least 30 employees of the facility traumatized, in addition to the number of retail workers in the shopping center and customers shopping on Black Friday.Again, it's time to exercise one of the greatest qualities of humanity - we must be bold enough to confront the systemic evils of our time. We must start having conversations and address this epidemic of evil by first admitting it resides within our own families. At some point, we must cease stretching our fingers at ""people like that"" or the distant and generalized ""people with mental health problems"" and confront the perfectly sane, calm, rational individuals within our families who espouse the same views as extremists.As President Obama said after Dear's surrender, ""This is not normal. We can't let it become normal. If we truly care about this - if we're going to offer up our thoughts and prayers again, for God knows how many times, with a truly clean conscience - then we have to do something"" and address the political and social hostility that has begun to boil over in America. At this point, we are succumbing to an American form of ISIS - radicalized individuals united by common cause to ""do something and take back this country"" from progress, equality, and national healthcare. We are better than that. We must, individually, begin discussions with family members, friends, neighbors, and coworkers about the way that these ideological acts of terrorism are corrupting our nation and tearing us apart, that the threat of terrorism does not come from across our borders but from across the table. It is not sufficient to ""like"" a post or share an article through social media. We must talk about these things face to face with those close to us, with love and concern yes, with understanding and generosity yes, but with firm commitment to name our concerns and show this false sense of patriotism for what it truly is - domestic terrorism."
26,SCIENCE,How Controversial Gene Editing Could Lead To Groundbreaking Cures,Lila Shapiro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gene-editing-crispr_us_5655fc7fe4b072e9d1c17cb1,This technology may change the way we think of some of the world's most challenging diseases.,2015-11-28,The gene-editing technique CRISPR could lead to cures for serious diseases.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565616741b0000470029ea40.jpeg?cache=wkQSWcizwr&ops=crop_0_129_2718_1672%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Thanks to the controversial new technology known as CRISPR, scientists are beginning to make headway in understanding and potentially curing some of the world's most intractable diseases.Sickle-cell anemia, HIV, schizophrenia and autism -- essentially, anything involving bad DNA is now fair game. The latest example, from a study published earlier this month in the journal Molecular Therapy, focuses on Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, which is one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy. The genetic disease causes the muscle fibers in the face, shoulders and upper arms to weaken over time -- and there is no known cure.Enter CRISPR. This new gene-editing technique allows researchers to easily change, delete or replace genes in any plant or animal, including people. Picture the precision and ease of the find-and-replace function on a word document -- that’s how easy it now is to change the human genome. As an article in the MIT Technology Review put it last year, “This means they can rewrite the human genome at will.” Or, as one bioethicist told The Huffington Post last week, comparing what CRISPR can do to earlier attempts at genetic manipulation, “We used to have a butter knife, now we’ve got a scalpel.”Biomedical researchers all over the world are now wondering how the technology might change their approach to all sorts of diseases. About a year ago, a team of FSHD researchers, led by Peter Jones at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, decided to give CRISPR a try. They already had a pretty good idea which of the thousands of genes in the human genome caused the disease, but until CRISPR came along therapeutic avenues were limited.The acronym CRISPR, which stands for (take a deep breath) “clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,” refers to both a technique and an actual thing, which is a macromolecular complex. The complex consists of a mix of two different types of biological material, protein and RNA. The RNA seeks out and binds to the targeted gene, like a hunting dog chasing down a fox, and the protein goes to work on it -- the hunter firing a shot.Why would someone want to hunt down a gene? There’s no one answer to that question. Bad genes are like Tolstoy’s unhappy families -- they’re all bad in different ways. Sometimes a mutated gene doesn’t make the protein it’s supposed to make. When that’s the case, CRISPR can be used to replace this lazy gene with one that actually does its job.Other times, the gene isn’t lazy, if you will, but is actively malicious -- it makes a protein that it’s not supposed to make, a toxin. That’s the story with FSHD. The U. Mass team figured they’d try to use CRISPR to shut down the gene, to “turn it off.” Until they got started on this study, no one had ever proved that CRISPR could be used to turn off a human disease gene, and the U. Mass researchers themselves weren’t sure it would work.Well, it did.The implications of this are pretty huge. The research could pave the way for other valuable studies, according to Charis Himeda, the lead author on the study. “I think progress for any disease is really progress for all diseases, because a lot of these therapies and technologies are going to turn out to be broadly applicable,” she said. It’s important, however, not to get carried away. Himeda said she didn’t know specifically which other diseases could possibly be cured as a result of CRISPR inhibition, and she thinks it’s too soon to start testing any of the CRISPR techniques on people. ‘I think there’s reason to be really hopeful that some day it’ll actually lead to great therapies for genetic diseases as long as we’re not too eager to get this to the clinic right away,” she said.Himeda’s use of CRISPR may be less risky than some of the other potential therapies. Replacing bad genes, as other scientists have done, involves cutting away pieces of DNA. To simply stop them from making stuff, as the U. Mass team has done, is less likely to cause the genes any permanent damage. But that doesn’t mean the technique is risk-free. Himeda points out that while they achieved a 50 percent reduction in expression of the FSHD disease gene, we still don’t know what the effects are on all the other genes in a cell. “There are things that we don’t understand yet that we need to characterize before we move forward,” Himeda said. There’s a bigger ethical question at play here, too. Many people think it’s simply a bad idea to meddle with the human genome, no matter what technique you use or how good your intentions are. The fact that CRISPR is so easy to use makes it especially frightening. What happens if it ends up in the wrong hands? If sci-fi has taught us anything, it’s that it won’t end well. Think the 1997 futuristic thriller ""Gattaca,"" where some children are conceived through genetic engineering to ensure a perfect -- and disease-free -- life, while others, known as ""in-valids,"" are relegated to a brutal existence of menial labor.Even Himeda worries about that. “People talk about it as a great tool, and it’s promising, but it’s also scary,” she noted. “We’re not ready for ‘Gattaca.’”Related coverage:* This Technology Can Fight Cancer And Create Adorable Mini Pigs.
