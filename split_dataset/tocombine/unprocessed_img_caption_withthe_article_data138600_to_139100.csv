1,QUEER VOICES,Sia's Dilemma: Does Working With Eminem Validate His Hate Speech Against Gays?,"Keo Nozari, Contributor

Gay & Lesbian Center at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on May 18, 2013 in Beverly Hills, California.

It upsets me that after all this time -- since 2001, to be specific -- Eminem still insists on using hate speech against people like me in his music. Some may deem pop and hip-hop lyrics ""unimportant,"" but music being a medium that I work in, I know firsthand the power that it wields to influence and affect lives (as I'm sure millions more can attest). Time and time again, Eminem has been informed about the negative impact that his hate speech has on the lives of the gay community, and although he's given some non-apologies to the likes of Anderson Cooper and issued platitudes about how he doesn't care what you are as long as you're ""nice to me,"" he continues to create derogatory lyrics against us. What upset me further was that Sia, an openly queer artist whom I deeply respect and have followed for 14 years, decided to write and sing a duet on the same album that features ""Rap God."" Sia is currently in the midst of several spectacular years in her career: She has written massive hits for Rihanna and Flo-Rida, co-wrote and sang David Guetta's ""Titanium,"" and is in high demand for collaborations with major players like Beyonc√© and Katy Perry, whose ""Double Rainbow"" with Sia is a highlight of her new album, Prism. So, how could she do this knowing Eminem's extensive anti-gay history and considering that she didn't need to work with him at this point, and especially during a time of horrible anti-gay bullying and LGBT suicides?So I wrote to Sia on Twitter and expressed my disappointment. I wasn't expecting a reply, but, to my surprise, she responded and thoughtfully listened, and we proceeded to have a lengthy (by Twitter standards) conversation. She initially defended Eminem (""I know personally that he is not homophobic, but a performance artist""), but it was clear from her responses that there was a bit of buyer's remorse about working with him after hearing ""Rap God."" She was refreshingly honest: ""I truly understand your point, and am certainly experiencing fear around the repercussions if he doesn't explain his art."" Considering his 13 years in this arena, I would guess that that's unlikely. She went on: ""I am queer, and love my queers, young and old. I work with the Center and homeless LGBT kids, and when I heard 'Rap God' I was very anxious."" She explained, ""He has a character called Slim Shady who represents the worst and darkest bile of America. I see how it can be unclear.""It's true. The argument that ""he's just playing a character"" assumes that listeners -- and notably the teens who are most vulnerable to bullying -- recognize all the nuances and are sophisticated enough to discern the difference between a celebrity who is perpetuating and validating negative, homophobic stereotypes and an artist who is playing a ""character"" or a ""persona"" while his private personal beliefs supposedly differ. But something that is private, by the very definition of the word ""private,"" is not generally meant for the public to know, so I tweet: ""What happens behind the scenes is invisible to most. [There is an] argument to be made [that] what an artist expresses publicly in their work matters most."" Few will remember or see what an artist says in a interview. What remains is the music. And if the message is derogatory, then that's ultimately what sticks. Eminem's fans on Twitter clearly illustrate my point. After my conversation with Sia, they immediately piled on the very terms that I was arguing against, directing them at me and even at Sia: ""Fag,"" ""Stop Being a Faggot,"" ""Shut Up Pussy."" One even advocated violence, taking his cue from the same lyric quoted above, telling both Sia and me, ""he [Eminem] shud break two tables not just one."" Indeed, through his lyrics, Eminem validates that very language and empowers them to use such hate speech. ""You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames off a plank, and tell me what in the fuck are you thinking."" --Eminem, ""Rap God""Fortunately, I'm a grown, confident man, but I remember what it was like to be a young gay boy growing up in small-town Minnesota. And I know what pop lyrics mean to impressionable teenagers, gay or straight. The CDC reports that eight out of 10 LGBT students are verbally harassed in school, and one in four has been a victim of physical assault. Then there are the suicides: LGBT teens are two to three times more likely to commit suicide than other teens. It's easy to see the correlation between hate speech that is validated by pop-culture figures like Eminem and the real-life repercussions that it has on human lives.Derogatory language against other minorities has recently seen notable pop-culture figures meet spectacular career deaths. Paula Deen's use of the ""N"" word resulted in the loss of her most lucrative contracts, from the Food Network to a book deal to product endorsements. Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic remarks, culminating over years and hitting a pinnacle with his public tirade during an arrest in 2006, deeply tarnished his career. Many celebrities defended Gibson, saying that, in their experience with him, ""he's not really an anti-Semite"" behind the scenes. Yet the words he used publicly, and also those that were recorded privately and leaked, suggest otherwise. But what happens when a popular rapper releases violent hate lyrics against gays? He is lavished with praise by Time, Rolling Stone and MTV News (to name a few). I personally believe that there is no room for homophobia in pop culture in 2013. The success of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis alone, and specifically the popularity of their beautiful, heartfelt ""Same Love,"" prove that you don't have to disparage gays in hip-hop, that you can in fact lift them up and still have massive chart success and financial gain. It is only when we raise up artists like these and call out the homophobes for what they are that love wins. I tweeted to Sia about my love for Macklemore, explaining his contrast to Eminem: ""The personal feeling is public art; don't need 2 diminish others for hits."" Sia responded, ""yeah I LOVE Macklemore. I have a bunch of songs I'm saving to give him when he's recording again."" Now that's a collaboration that I can be excited about.As for Sia on her Eminem collaboration, she tweeted to me, ""I feel powerless. I thought Slim Shady had been put to bed. Now what's done is done on my end. I guess my only hope at this point is that 'Beautiful Pain' [her song with Eminem] will do more good than 'Rap God' does harm."" Agreed. But what really gave me hope for artists not working with hate-mongering performers was that our conversation gave her pause for reflection. She wrote, ""I'm going to think on our discussion.""What are your thoughts about Sia collaborating with Eminem? Sound off in the comments below.Here are some screen shots of my Twitter conversation with Sia:"
2,QUEER VOICES,Classifying Blue Is the Warmest Color,"Noah Tsika, Contributor
Assistant Professor of Media Studies at Queens College, City U...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/blue-is-the-warmest-color_us_5bafbd53e4b0ad76926121fe,"Under no circumstances will I call Blue Is the Warmest Color a ""lesbian"" film. Does that matter? I think so, particularly since the film has generated stories of on-set sadism that smack of over a century of movies made by men well-schooled in the cruel manipulation of women.",2013-11-02,"This photo released by courtesy of Sundance Selects shows Adele Exarchopoulos, left, as Adele, and Lea Seydoux, as Emma, in the film, ""Blue Is the Warmest Color,"" directed by Abdellatif Kechiche. (AP Photo/Courtesy Sundance Selects)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafbd532000009900ff707c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A galvanizing conversation starter since its Cannes premiere, Blue Is the Warmest Color has rather persistently been positioned as a ""lesbian"" film, particularly in the popular press. To be sure, its controversial elements stem from its unblinking representation of same-sex erotic contact, of two young women who, in terms that they never explicitly discuss, perform oral sex (among other acts) on one another. I loved the film, found myself swept up in its torrential romanticism, in its uncanny capturing of the idiosyncratic awkwardness of youth, and especially in the lead performance of relative newcomer Ad√®le Exarchopoulos, whose character's emotions are perilously close to the surface and keep spilling over. That said, I share some specifically queer reservations about the film, its content, and especially its labeling.The film's central character, Ad√®le, does not identify as a lesbian. At first, her refusal to do so (following a somewhat hokey masturbation scene that is intercut with fantasy images of her female love object) seems reflective of her self-denial, her internalized homophobia, and her somewhat cowardly response to schoolyard pressure. As the film progresses, however, it becomes increasingly clear that Ad√®le has no intention of ever identifying as queer, and for me, the film appeared to fall into a fashionable ""post-gay"" rhythm, recalling the Brokeback Mountain conception of same-sex love as an inchoate ""force of nature,"" and finally preempting any connections to queer history. (Compare, for instance, Xavier Dolan's equally epic Lawrence Anyways, with its sobering and edifying awareness of many of the historical methods by which the legal and medical fields have sought to legitimize transphobia.) I am wont, for a variety of reasons, to defend Blue Is the Warmest Color, but under no circumstances will I call it a ""lesbian"" film.My response may say more about me than about Blue, for I consider myself exclusively gay in spite of having been steeped in queer theory for most of my adult life, and I resent the rapidly intensifying suggestion that this information is unimportant, even pathologically superfluous in a ""post-gay"" society. What certainly isn't superfluous, what is politically as well as taxonomically significant, even in the 21st century, is the ""queer"" label in the arts, the kind of designation that can serve a community-building and community-sustaining function, that announces and endorses LGBTQIA authorship, and that delineates (but cannot guarantee) a safe space for consumption by sexual minorities. In general, there are two ways of gauging a film's queerness, two approaches to taxonomy. One is to assay the director's public persona for signs of a clear queer consciousness, of a non-straight sexual-orientation identity. The other is to apply similar reading strategies to the film's protagonist, the person through whose eyes the narrative unfolds, for whom the experiences explored seem to matter the most. The two approaches -- let's call them the Authorship Model and the Main Character Model, respectively -- rarely generate a ""lesbian"" label. Perhaps owing to a rather deep-seated stereotype of straight masculinity wherein ""lesbian"" sex is performed purely for the delectation of men, global cinema history is filled with titles that often erroneously go by the name ""queer."" These include, conspicuously, films directed by straight-identified men that offer extended ""lesbian"" sex scenes but whose central characters are inescapably estranged from queer identity politics, who don't, simply put, self-define as gay. Consider, for instance, a pair of equally controversial American films: Personal Best, from 1982, and The Killing of Sister George, from 1968. In the former, written and directed by straight-identified auteur Robert Towne, Chris (played by the strapping Mariel Hemingway) enters into a sexual relationship with another woman, a fellow pentathlete (played by Patrice Donnelly), without ever considering herself a lesbian. In fact, the ""point"" of the film appears, in part, to be to ""prove"" that same-sex erotic activity is but a stepping stone toward a more ""mature,"" procreative form of sexuality, as Chris ""evolves"" into an appreciation for boys, eventually pairing up with a male swimmer and self-identifying as straight. (In Blue Is the Warmest Color, Ad√®le appears to trace a reverse trajectory, breaking up with a boy in order to pursue her passion for a girl, but she later responds with keen-eyed interest to a handsome young man who twice tells her that she's desirable, a guy's dream.) In Sister George, directed by straight filmmaker Robert Aldrich (known mostly for his ""manly"" action films), a self-identified lesbian, uncouth at home and increasingly unsuccessful at work, watches her much-younger girlfriend fall for an elegant female television executive, who, in a notorious extended sex scene, propels her toward orgasm with her pale, manicured hands. Neither film fits the twofold taxonomic model outlined above, even if Sister George seems closest with its loud-and-proud lesbian protagonist. How, then, might one make sense of Blue Is the Warmest Color, whose lengthy, wordless sex scenes recall the similarly nonverbal, equally protracted depiction of vaginal play in Sister George? Is Blue a ""straight"" film or a ""gay"" one? The film's director, Abdellatif Kechiche, is firmly straight-identified, like Towne and Aldrich. His film has spurred debates about voyeuristic depictions of intertwining female bodies, as surely as did Personal Best and Sister George (neither of whose sex scenes seems quite as suggestive of gay-for-pay pornography as Blue's first ""lesbian"" encounter, with its rhythmic panting and static shots). Kechiche's feature is not, strictly speaking, a ""lesbian"" film, according to either the Authorship Model or the Main Character Model. Does that matter? I think so, particularly since the film has generated such bad press, with widely circulating stories of on-set sadism that smack of over a century of movies made by men well-schooled in the cruel manipulation of women. In cinema, behind-the-scenes psychology still matters, especially to the extent that it helps us measure a film's queer credentials."

Warren)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb71f6624000051009875ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Greg Gabriel, National Football PostOregon has one of the highest scoring and quickest paced offenses in the country. You would think they would have a number of senior prospects on their roster. That‚Äôs not the case. The bad news for the Pac-12, and the rest of the country, is that there is only one senior NFL prospect on offense, wide receiver Josh Huff. He will probably be a premium pick. There are two underclassmen who the draftniks feel will declare for this draft. They are quarterback Marcus Mariota and running back De‚ÄôAnthony Thomas. The best way to find out which underclassmen may be coming out is to check with the agent community because they are actively recruiting these kids. According to agents I know, Thomas is definitely considering coming out. Mariota, on the other hand, will probably stay in school. I will write up Mariota in this post because there is a chance he will enter the draft but the best move for him would be to stay in school. His overall game is not as good as his stats would say it is. Being a redshirt sophomore, he still has two years of eligibility and a lot of developing to do.Marcus Mariota ‚Äì QuarterbackMariota is a third year sophomore and a two year starter. He is a former 3-star recruit and red shirted in 2011, his true freshman year. He started every game in 2012, throwing for 2600 yards, and rushing for 752 yards. This year, he has picked up where he left off, completing 144 of 225 passes for 2281 yards and 20 TDs. He has not thrown an interception. He has also rushed for 511 yards and 9 TDs. As good as his numbers are, I don‚Äôt believe he is ready to jump to the NFL.Mariota has excellent size at about 6‚Äô4 ‚Äì 215 and runs a sub 4.5. He is an excellent athlete with rare speed, quickness, and body control for a QB. While he might not be quite as fast as RGIII, he may be a better all- around athlete. He always plays from a fast-paced, spread formation and is surrounded by a cast of very impressive athletes at the skill positions. Oregon runs a read option offense, and Mariota is a perfect fit to run that style. As a runner, he is second to none. He has great speed and change of direction. He shows excellent run instincts and is both elusive and strong as a runner. He is a threat to go the distance any time he runs with the ball. He needs improvement in the passing game. While his stats are excellent, when you watch the tape, you can see the flaws. He has a compact, overhand delivery, but at times, looks like he is pushing or aiming the ball. He has good arm strength and throws a tight ball. What concerns me is in that offense, his receivers are ALWAYS wide open. In all the tape I watched, he only had to make one throw into a tight space. Most of his throws are short throws. (short outs and slants, bubble screens, screens. swing passes, short crossing and comeback routes) While he has very good accuracy, when you look at his completion percentage, his ball placement is often off. Even on short throws, when his target is wide open, he throws a pass that the receiver has to adjust to. While he can get away with that at the college level, he won‚Äôt be able to get away with that in the NFL. His deep ball accuracy and ball placement is average at best. He is off target by a wide margin on many of these types of throws. Because of that, they don‚Äôt throw deep that often, and when they do, more often than not, he throws to a wide open target. The good news is he doesn‚Äôt force throws and try to throw into coverage. He shows good ability to see the field, find an open receiver, and he is patient.I believe he is a very talented player and he will improve his passing as he gains experience. Both ESPN Draft analysts say he is a top five player. In another year, that may be true, but he isn‚Äôt now. He has too many flaws as a passer. He will be much better off going back to Oregon for another year.Can he get drafted in the 1st round if he comes out? Yes, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he should come out. Except for last year, the NFL has over drafted at the QB position for about the last five years. Too many players who didn‚Äôt have the talent to be first round picks got drafted there because clubs forced the picks with the lack of quality players at the position. Players like Gabbert, Tebow, Ponder, and Weeden have all been first round mistakes. Many scouts in the league do a poor job of evaluating that position. Too often, they just look at the physical traits and not the mental. On top of that, they have to realize that the pro game is so much more difficult than the college game. There are any number of things a QB can do in college that he will never be able to do in the NFL. Mariota is supposed to be very smart and a great kid. I‚Äôd hate to see him end up like some of the players I just mentioned because he succumbed to pressure and came out too early.Josh Huff ‚Äì ReceiverHuff is a fourth year senior and a three year starter at wide receiver. He also is used to return kickoffs. Even though he didn‚Äôt start as a true freshman, he got significant play time and accumulated over 1000 yards in total offense. This year, he is the Ducks leading receiver to date with 38 catches for 703 yards and six TDs. He has returned eight kickoffs for a 26 yard average.Huff has good size at 5‚Äô11- 205. He looks and plays taller because of his long arms. He has very good play speed to go along with excellent athleticism and body control. His play speed is in the 4.45 ‚Äì 4.48 area. In the Oregon offense, he is not asked to run a number of different types of routes. He will run outs, slants, comebacks, and bubble screens with an occasional deep route thrown in. I would not say he is a precise route runner, but with his body control and quickness, he can get in and out of cuts very quickly to gain separation. Often, he is wide open. Opponents usually play a soft zone against Oregon, and they give up a lot of short throws. I don‚Äôt remember seeing Huff have to uncover versus man coverage.Huff has very good hands, showing the ability to snatch the ball. He always catches the ball away from his body. After the catch he is a very good runner, showing a burst, elusiveness, and strength. Many of his longer gains are short passes that he turned into a big gain with his run skills. On the tape viewed, I did not have an opportunity to see Huff have to compete for the ball in traffic. He was always open. He is a willing blocker and will look for a downfield block to help a back or receiver.This is a talented player. He has speed, hands, run after skills, and toughness. He can and will double as a returner, as his return skills are very good. He needs to develop his route running, but he will play early as a rookie and eventually be a starter in the league. I see him as becoming a solid number two receiver.De‚ÄôAnthony Thomas ‚Äì Running backThomas is a third year junior. While he has started many games, he plays in a rotation. He is a former 5-star recruit who was offered by many of the top programs in the country. He is not a very big guy. He stands about 5‚Äô9 ‚Äì 173, but he is very fast (4.38 est) with great cutting ability, body control, and run instincts. He lines up as a running back, a slot receiver, and used to return kicks.As a RB, he has excellent initial quickness but is also patient. He does a very good job setting up blocks and cutting off those blocks. He has very good vision and can make the quick cut in the hole. He has a great burst and top end speed to turn the corner on outside plays, and once in the open field, it often becomes a foot race that he easily wins. As an inside runner, he can make the quick cut to daylight and produce a big run, but he is not a good after-contact runner. While he runs hard and is strong, he lacks the bulk and power to break tackles inside. As a receiver, he has good hands, can get open, and again, once the ball is in his hands, he becomes a nightmare for the defense. He is extremely dangerous as a return man. His open field run skills are rare.Thomas will never be a full-time player at the next level. He will be used as a rotational RB and used some as a slot receiver. When you add his ability to return kicks, he can probably touch the ball 15 ‚Äì 18 times a game and have a direct influence on the outcome of the game. When we see players like Tavon Austin go in the first round, it‚Äôs easy to see that Thomas will get drafted that high. Whenever he is on the field, he has to be accounted for. He is a difference maker with the ball in his hands. The problem he will have is durability. With his lack of size, he may be prone to injury. He has already missed three games and most of a fourth this year. Still, a team will gamble on his big play ability.Follow me on twitter @greggabe"
