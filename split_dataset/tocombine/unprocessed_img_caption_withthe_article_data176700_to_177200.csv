My dad would eat Spam with fried eggs and rice -- breakfast, lunch, dinner, didn't matter what time of day it was. As a child, I attributed my father's love of Spam to his pedestrian food knowledge (he pronounces the J in fajita), but it turns out he's not alone. Hawaii consumes more Spam than any state in our union -- in total, 7 million cans a year.According to the SPAM website, the island's love affair with Spam began in World War II, when GIs were served the salty luncheon meat because it didn't require refrigeration and had a long shelf life. The Hormel Corporation, which manufactures Spam, provided 15 million cans to Allied troops every week. Between 1941 and 1945, Hormel had shipped over 100 million pounds overseas.Though the name Spam is a shortened version of ""spiced ham,"" Army soldiers would often refer to it as ""Special Army Meat."" Surpluses of Spam made their way from the soldiers' supplies into native diets throughout the Pacific. To this day, Hawaiians love Spam Musubi, a sushi-style slice of Spam served with rice and seaweed, spam fried rice, and my dad's favorite, spam and eggs.Spam is so popular throughout Hawaii that it's been nicknamed the ""Hawaiian steak"" and is even found on the islands' McDonald's and Burger King menus. During the last week of April, the annual Spam Jam takes place in Waikiki. And before taking office, Hawaii's most prominent native son, Barack Obama, surprised reporters when he ordered spam musubi while on vacation in Oahu.But Hawaii isn't alone. In the territory of Guam, each person consumes 16 cans of Spam a year on average. In the UK, Spam fritters are served battered and deep-fried. In Hong Kong, Spam is often eaten with instant noodles. And as a result of the Korean War, Koreans enjoy Spam kimbap, a rice and vegetable filled seaweed roll.Has Spam found its way into your diet? Here's a few places where you can try Spam Musubi stateside:• Aloha Café - Los Angeles, CA • Paradise Hawaiian Barbecue - Phoenix, AZ • Kauai Family Restaurant - Seattle, WA • Alohana Hawaiian Grill - Des Moines, IA • Ate-Oh-Ate Hawaiian Restaurant - Portland, OR • The Sushi Place - Baltimore, MD • Makana - New York, NYRelated Links from the Menuism Restaurant Blog: • 5 Hawaiian Food Favorites • The Hawaiian Plate Lunch • Loco Moco: A Hawaiian Food TraditionWhy Do Hawaiians Love Spam So Much? first published on the Menuism Hawaiian Food Blog.Kimberly Kohatsu is the Managing Editor of the Menuism Dining Blog, the educational arm of Menuism.com, a popular website where a passionate community of foodies rate their favorite dishes and comment on restaurants they've visited.

1,WELLNESS,Considering a Stem Cell Treatment From a Clinic? Have a Listen,"Paul Knoepfler, Contributor

It's an exciting field of research, and I'm fortunate to be a part of it. I think it will transform medicine over the next two decades, but unfortunately today the phrase ""stem cells"" is being used right now by folks who simply want your money.The number of clinics offering for-profit, point-of-care stem cell treatments is rapidly increasing even as the FDA, which keeps an eye on them, has unfortunately had a static budget for years now. Roughly in parallel, the number of patients and parents of patients contacting me has shot up.Their question above all else is the following:Should I or a loved one, usually a child, get a stem cell treatment?Most often these folks are in a difficult situation. Either they or their loved one has pretty much exhausted all that today's conventional medicine has to offer, but they are still suffering. Understandably, they are exploring other options, including stem cell treatments, which do sound exciting.When I say ""stem cell transplant"" here, I'm not referring to something like bone marrow transplants offered by doctors at universities or hospitals, treatments for blood cancers that have been around for decades. Instead, I mean sketchier offerings that are called ""stem cell treatments"" but are not FDA approved. Usually the folks selling these treatments are in fact trying to avoid the FDA's attention. The treatment is offered at a clinic that makes claims not supported by published science. I call these ""dubious"" clinics offering ""dubious"" stem cell treatments. They can cost $10,000-$20,000 a pop or higher.These treatments often are marketed with claims that seem too good to be true. For example, while thousands of doctors around the world have no treatment for autism, miraculously some clinic in a strip mall in Latin America or Los Angeles offers one that works 90 percent of the time? Really?You name the incurable, untreatable disease, and these clinics claim that stem cells can cure them.If so, you might wonder, why aren't these treatments offered by large hospitals, particularly research hospitals in the U.S.? Typically the clinic's answer to this is that there is a horrible plot by Big Pharma and the FDA to kill stem cell treatments. It's not true.I tell patients to be very cautious, and I advise against these clinics. There are risks to these kinds of treatments, including cancer, and usually there is zero evidence they work. Yes, I know celebrities are getting stem cell treatments for cosmetic reasons, and sports stars are getting them, and even politicians like Rick Perry. However, don't let celebrities guide your medical decisions. They are no smarter and no wiser than you.These clinics also heavily use patient testimonials to sell their treatments to you, but I'd view such testimonials cautiously. As much as I think the world of the patients I've met and had contact with and as much as I myself was a cancer patient, testimonials are no substitute for rigorous medical science.I recommend educating yourself further.For more information, check out my patient's guide to stem cell treatments as well as my easy-to-use clinical trial finder for stem cell trials.I'm a stem cell researcher and cancer survivor who has no monetary interest in the success or failure of any stem cell clinic. I just want to help educate and empower patients to help them make the best decisions for themselves in consultation with their own doctors.For more by Paul Knoepfler, click here.For more on stem cells, click here.

(AP Photo/Khin Maung Win)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c53792500003500360548.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""We are in the presence of greatness,"" announced an ebullient Congressman Joseph Crowley to a roomful of dignitaries, celebrities and activists who had gathered to hear Burmese opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on her first visit to the U.S. after nearly two decades of enforced isolation in Rangoon. To me, Crowley's statement was not hyperbolic. For almost twenty years as a professional in the field of human rights, I had looked upon ""The Lady,"" as Suu Kyi is oft-referred, as the personification of moral leadership in our time. Nothing short of a role model on the scale of Gandhi and Martin Luther King. After years of assuming I would never have the opportunity to see her in person, there I was on the campus of Queens College in New York early on a Saturday morning to simply soak in her presence. Suu Kyi's U.S. tour has been a victory lap. On this morning, Speaker Christine Quinn presented her with a citation from the New York City Council. Musician Carole King serenaded her, customizing the words to her well-known song, ""Daw Suu Kyi, you've got a friend!"" while actress Angelica Huston read from Suu Kyi's essay ""Freedom from Fear."" Most memorable for me, however, was the strong under-current of sound advice for raising the next generation of global citizens with duty, discipline and, yes, even love...On being a responsible citizen: Teaching young people not to take their rights for granted is absolutely essential, Suu Kyi said. During her years living in England while her late husband taught at Oxford, Suu Kyi would frequently challenge friends who didn't vote in the strongest of terms. ""It seemed to me such a waste of an opportunity. Also a lack of respect for a right that you should guard with your very life. You must vote. You must use your democratic rights. Otherwise, they will fade away.""On the importance of discipline (and rest): For fifteen of the past 21 years, Suu Kyi lived under house arrest. During that time she thrived on discipline. ""From day one I set myself a very strict timetable,""she said. She meditated for an hour each morning, followed by exercise, reading and listening to the radio. Then she set to work. ""Except on the weekends, when I rested, which is important for everyone.""On unconditional love: Although her father, General Aung San, considered the father of modern day Burma, was assassinated when Suu Kyi was just 2, she had always sensed that she had been his favorite. ""To all the parents in the room -- really, this is important for everyone -- any child who feels they have been truly loved, even by just one person, will develop tremendous confidence."" There is much more to be said about Burma and Aung San Suu Kyi's role in its nascent democracy. But on a day designed for reflection and celebration, I hope you, too, find encouragement in her example and her words."
3,PARENTING,Mommy's Afternoon Off,"Devon Corneal, Contributor
Mother, writer, lawyer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mommys-afternoon-off_us_5b9c5492e4b03a1dcc7dd747,"Parents of young children know what I'm talking about. Sometimes, I have an almost primal need to escape.",2012-09-24,Kids playing with plastic blocks - two boys and girl,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c5492240000310094a1e5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I have done many things of which I am not proud. I have ignored Little Dude as he calls me from the backyard. I have hidden in the bathroom. I promise to come back and play in one minute and I leave the room for twenty. I let my boy watch hours of television. I tell my husband I'm running a quick errand and slowly wander the aisles of the local grocery store when all I need is a loaf of bread. On occasion, I pretend to be sleeping when my son wakes up a little too early. When my parents come to stay, I hand off my kid for their entire visit. These might not be my most shining moments, but the truth is, I will do almost anything to get even five minutes to myself. Parents of young children know what I'm talking about. Sometimes, I have an almost primal need to escape. Sadly, I rarely use this time to read a book, get my nails done or have lunch with a friend. You won't find me napping or going to yoga. I almost always use these rare breaks to buy groceries, do laundry, organize a closet or make dinner. I cobble together stolen minutes at every opportunity, but instead of living the glamorous life, I'm just trying to get everything done. Last weekend, however, I needed more than a few minutes. I needed a few hours. I had to clean out the attic. I was in search of a pair of bargain bin sneakers I bought for Little Dude two years ago. Mommy loves a bargain. I knew I put them somewhere where I could find them. Unfortunately, I couldn't. In my pre-parent life, I wouldn't have bought a pair of sneakers for my kid two years ago ""because he'll grow into them someday."" Of course, in my pre-parent life I was organized. These days, I can barely hold it together. I have wasted days of my life searching for sunglasses, my phone and matching socks. My husband is used to my frantic scavenger hunts for keys, permission slips, and hidden Christmas presents. I squirrel things away, certain that I've put them in such an obvious place that there is no way I can forget where they are, only to spend a few hours scouring closets and cupboards and dark corners of the attic crawlspace looking for them. Last Sunday was no different, except Errand-Running Husband was out. I didn't have a babysitter. The attic was dirty, dangerous and no place for a four-year old. To accomplish my goal, I had to do something drastic. I had to get rid of Little Dude. As I stood there wondering how exactly I could district a four-year old with the attention span of a flea for more than 20 minutes, he said the magic words: ""Mommy, can I go over to my friend's house to play?""I had been waiting for this. It's not that Little Dude hasn't played at his friends' houses before. He has. But I've always been there -- sharing in the supervision, breaking-up squabbles, eating crackers in the kitchen with another parent. I had thought that four was too young for a drop-off playdate, but like most things I thought I knew before having children, I could be wrong. Today I was ready to throw caution to the wind. To risk being labeled one of those moms who foist their children off on other people. To boldly go where I had never gone before. I arranged a Mommy-free playdate -- the Holy Grail of parenting.I felt uncomfortable pawning an unpredictable four year old on someone who is not obligated to love him, but the guilt passed quickly. It didn't hurt that he wanted to play with K's son. K lives three doors down and her son and Little Dude can hold their own while trying to wrest favorite toys away from each other. K is also from Kentucky, so I know she will take me up on my standing offer to wrap my kid in duct tape if he misbehaves. I like that in a parent. She's also the friend who offers to take Little Dude to the pool, or for a weekend if we want to go away. She says, ""I already have three kids, what's one more?"" I think that's a trick question, but maybe she's just really bad at math. Everyone should have a K in their life. Especially if you want to clean out the attic. I made the call. I dropped off the kid. I did not look back. I crossed my fingers and hoped that Little Dude didn't screw this up by throwing a temper tantrum or refusing to share. I was 90 minutes into my project (seriously, how hard can it be to find a pair of shoes?), when I heard Little Dude crying from K's yard. The guilt took over and I went to investigate. I'm sure a more experienced parent would have pretended not to hear the shrieks wafting in the early autumn air. As I walked down the street, I ran into K and her two girls heading out for a bike ride. I apologized for Little Dude's crying and said I'd take him home, trying to keep the disappointment from my voice. K laughed and told me it was her son having a fit, not mine. She was leaving her husband in charge and heading out. If she was fine leaving the boys, so was I. I headed home. This playdate thing rocks. Thirty minutes later, the attic was clean and I had the sneakers. I collected Little Dude. Everyone survived. I found out later that K. had, at varying times, hosted nine children that day. Either her math skills are even worse than I thought, or she has a high tolerance for chaos, noise and destruction of all types. I feel a tiny bit guilty about taking advantage of my lovely neighbor. But only a tiny bit. Whatever qualms I may have, it certainly isn't going to stop me from trying it again. My basement is a mess."

Or are you planning on expecting a baby? Don't shake your head at me, old man! Medical science has not yet tested its limits -- you could be pregnant any day now! You, dear reader, may soon be expecting a baby. Every one of you. There are already hundreds of books on pregnancy (What to Expect When You're Expecting has sold about forty fewer copies than the King James Bible), and in recent years there have even been dozens of hard-truth books for the dad-to-be on coping with his wife's pregnancy. (They tend to have chapter titles like ""You're Not Going to Want to Bring That Up Right Now"" and ""Get Your Own Damn Coffee Cake!"") The current literature pretty much has the pregnancy thing covered.As a man, I can't really speak to what a woman is going through during pregnancy. But from watching my own beautiful wife go through it twice (with mesmerizing fortitude, I have to say), I can say that it appears to be a bit of a trying time. (I'm not sure we men have anything to compare it to, really -- maybe imagine running a marathon wearing an iron lung while strangers and sketchy co-workers race alongside you, trying to palm your belly like a basketball and cheerfully calling you euphemisms for ""crazy fat."")But I have been through The Child Naming Process. And when you get to this point in your life, my future-parent friends, you have just wandered into one hell of a minefield. To spare you from the disaster that awaits you, I'm going to go ahead and give you 8 Rules for Naming Your Future Child. Ignore them at your peril.1. Don't be diplomatic. I know you want to please your wife/husband. It's admirable! But this is not the time. Husbands, your wife is charged full of hormones, and you're going to find that one evening after watching the Sunday night movie on Lifetime she's going to walk into the kitchen, take a cleansing breath, and inform you that you will be naming your son The Notebook. Wives, you must be similarly vigilant, because every man on the planet is just aching to name his son either ""Magnus"" or ""Pete Townsend."" (If he denies it he's a damn liar and you ought to start questioning every other thing he's ever told you.) You have veto power, parents-to-be: Use it!2. Never, ever share the name with ANYONE. If you are absolutely forced to share the name of your unborn child with the grandparents, for example, have a prepared script that you can hand them to read, word for word, upon your disclosure of the name. This script will read thusly: ""I LOVE that name!! You have chosen the perfect name. You will notice that I am not furrowing my eyebrows and saying ""Hmmm..."" as if contemplating it, nor am I offering an alternative suggestion. This is because I understand that we are not discussing what color to paint the laundry room, but rather the name of your child. If the name is Charlotte I shall say ""Beautiful! Classic!!"" rather than wrinkling my nose and saying ""You mean like Sex in the City?"" Nor shall I choose this moment to mention how my ex-boyfriend was named ""Nathaniel,"" and that he turned out to be a total dirtbag. I shall do none of these things because I am not part of this decision. I am only here to support you -- and I do. You are brilliant. Adieu."" 3. Don't name a child after anyone in the public arena. Unless, of course, it's a common enough name that you can pretend it was named after somebody else (William, for example). If you have already made this mistake, and your baby is named O.J. or something, you can tell people ""Actually, he's named after the composer,"" which will get you out of any situation because it makes you sound smart and nobody wants to admit they don't know the famous composer, O.J. Backenhof. 4. Don't avoid names because you're afraid of what it rhymes with. Who cares that Carter rhymes with Farter? Kids are creative -- believe me, they'll find a reason to tease kids with or without name-rhyming. Just remember the Golden Rule: If you have a boy, don't name him a name that is unmistakably a girl's name, like ""Cindy Lou"" or ""Girly Estrogella."" (This rule doesn't apply to girls, for some reason. Girls with boy's names just sound awesome.)5. Don't name your son after your super rich uncle in hopes that he'll leave you some inheritance. First of all, no kid wants to be named ""Salvador the Rat."" Second of all, there's a decent chance that uncle will end up dying in federal prison from a gut wound.6. Don't give them weird spellings. Who does this help? Certainly not your daughter, who is frankly getting pretty tired of having to correct the spelling of ""Kim"" five times a day. (""It's actually 'Kighm.'"") Listen -- Kighm can be original all on her own, I promise you. Have a little faith, and save her the lifetime of frustration.7. Don't make rash decisions. Figure out the name before you go into the maternity ward. Studies show that if you don't already have the name picked out, it's about 3 to 1 that the kid is coming out of the hospital with a name like ""Epidural"" or ""Freedom!!"" 8. If you're a hippy, take a few months off from being a hippy. Come live like the rest of us, just until the baby is born. No kid deserves to be named ""Blown Glass"" because you decided to get all high and go to Colonial Williamsburg. As for me, I was named Conor in 1974 (the Irish spelling of that name, with one 'n') by my Irish father and worldly mother, at a time when that name didn't exist as a first name. I got the same question every day: Is Conor your first name or your last name? And one memorable day in Kindergarten I came home crying, furious at my father because the other kids had made fun of my unusual name.So my father, the Irish poet Eamon Grennan, told me the story of the first Conor -- Conor mac Nessa, the legendary Irish king. He told me how Conor was born the same day as Christ himself, how he became king when he was just 7 years old (""That's in two years, lad!"") and how he became the greatest ruler in the history of Ulster.I still hated my name. But those stories, that meaning, made it a little easier to bear. It told me that my parents weren't just punishing me. It told me that they knew what they were doing. That they had been purposeful in their choice. That they had named me -- the goofy, red-haired, ill-mannered, walking-temper-tantrum of a boy -- after a King."

If you wanted to retire, you could have done that a long time ago. You like what you do and will never stop.""My statement shook his inner psyche, and then he realized I was right. He never truly plans to quit. He realized I operate in the same fashion. The idea of sitting in a rocking chair and playing shuffle board is not in my game plan.Someone once asked when I would retire. I responded death. My work brings me great joy. I can't imagine ever giving it up. The great Kentuckian Al Smith wrote his first book at age 84, and at age 85, just finished his second book, Kentucky Cured, which will be released in November.Al always has something to do and some place to go. Al is an interesting role model in that he had a full-time job for 20 years. Years ago, he sold his chain of newspapers and devoted the rest of his life to helping others. I'm not privy to Al's financial information, but suspect he and his wife set up their finances with a long-term view in mind. Which is what I would like some former professional athletes do. Sports Illustrated did a fascinating study in 2009 titled ""How (and Why) Athletes Go Broke."" The statistics are stunning. By the time they have been retired for two years, 78 percent of former NFL football players have gone bankrupt or under financial stress because of joblessness or divorce. Within five years of retirement, an estimated 60 percent of former NBA basketball players are broke.These are people who made millions. What happened? I see a lot of them blow money on large entourages and wild spending, the same way many lottery winners do. But I see a lot more get burned by getting involved in businesses far away from their area of expertise.According to the USA Today, my childhood hero Oscar Robertson has a plethora of tax and financial problems related to a chemical company he owns. Robertson is not only a basketball legend; he has been a devoted community advocate who has lived his life in an exemplary fashion.At age 73, it's going to be tough for the Big O to make big money again. People often ask me, ""Why don't some of these professional athletes put their money in the bank or a lifetime annuity? They don't need to do anything risky or stupid.""A good question. I suspect that the same type of confidence and courage that allows someone to become a professional athlete works against them in the business world.They never know when to go to the sidelines. It's not that hard to be financially secure. You spend less than you make, you save the rest and don't do anything stupid. You assume you are going to live to an extremely old age and make sure you have money that lasts as long as you do. It's not hard, but it's tedious. And it's not the least bit glamorous. I knew of a woman who was always trying to meet a guy driving a new Mercedes. She should have been looking for someone who drives a 10-year-old Toyota. The Toyota driver is more likely to have real wealth in the long run. The focus on long-term savings is the primary difference between my friend who has real wealth and big stars who have spent real wealth. My friend accumulated his wealth quietly and protects his money carefully. I can testify that he is intensely frugal and has no inner need to show off his wealth. His money is a byproduct of his focus on putting out a quality product. He also knows his business. Inside and out. He knows as much about his industry as Oscar Robertson knows about basketball. He goes to work everyday because he enjoys operating at the peak of his potential. Just like Oscar Robertson did when he played basketball. Oscar got out of basketball near the top of his game. After the Cincinnati Royals made the silly mistake of trading him in 1970, he led the Milwaukee Bucks to an NBA championship before he stepped down in 1974. I hope he works out his financial problems and leaves the business world on top as well. He is a classy guy who needs to ask himself an important question: At what point do you stop taking financial risks?
