Officials have not publicly identified the inmate who was killed, pending family notification.The corrections department said inmate-made weapons were used. It added that prisoners’ movements would be limited as the investigation into disturbance unfolded.Further details were not immediately available.The prison has been the site of several violent outbreaks in recent years.In September 2012, an inmate was shot by a guard and 12 others were sent to the hospital with stab wounds and head trauma in a melee involving 60 inmates.About a year earlier, nine inmates were taken to a hospital with stab and gunshot wounds as well as blunt force trauma after 50 inmates rioted.The prison is a maximum-security facility that houses about 2,300 inmates, most serving long sentences.Also known as ""New Folsom,"" it is adjacent to Folsom State Prison, which is better known because of the song ""Folsom Prison Blues"" by Johnny Cash, who also performed a celebrated concert there in 1968.

""The most important thing throughout this is ensuring the health and safety of the residents and visitors near the river. """"EPA is an agency whose core mission is ensuring a clean environment and protecting public health, so it pains me to see this happening,"" she continued. The Aug. 5 spill released lead, arsenic, cadmium and other dangerous contaminants from the former Gold King Mine site into a creek that flows into the Animas River. That river flows into the San Juan River and down through New Mexico, raising concerns about downstream pollution.The EPA was at the site investigating ongoing water releases from mines in the area and assessing whether it could take additional remediation measures. The agency said the team at the site misjudged the pressure that had built up at the entrance of the mine.The Gold King Mine has been out of use since 1923, and is one of thousands of abandoned mine sites across the country. There are 22,000 abandoned sites in Colorado alone, local NPR affiliate KUNC reported. For many of these mines, the previous owners are long gone, leaving the EPA on the hook for cleanup and spill prevention.Someone at the agency clearly screwed up here, which has led to lots of public outcry in the region targeted at the EPA, and to the administrator's contrition Tuesday. But as others have pointed out, there are various reasons cleanup at this and other sites has been complicated.As the Durango Herald has reported, the EPA wanted to declare abandoned mines around the region a Superfund site, which would increase the amount of funds available for cleanup. But residents and government officials in the area pushed back because they were worried about the impact a Superfund declaration would have on tourism.EPA and local officials recently reached an agreement that the agency would work on cleaning up the ongoing pollution from the mines without declaring a Superfund site, which is what prompted the work that led to last week's accident. McCarthy said Tuesday that the incident occurred ""when one of our contracting teams was using heavy equipment to enter the Gold King Mine … to begin the process of pumping and treating the contaminated water inside."" The Denver Post has also reported on another issue that has hindered cleanup at mine sites in the state: concerns about liability in the event of an accident. Because of the current interpretation of the Clean Water Act, environmental groups and state governments have feared taking on cleanup because they could be held liable for costs if something goes wrong. The EPA moved to reduce the legal liability in 2012, and Colorado's congressional delegation has sought to amend the Clean Water Act to make it easier for third-party ""Good Samaritans"" to help with cleanup. But those legislative efforts have not been successful so far.McCarthy plans to travel to Colorado and New Mexico on Wednesday to inspect response efforts, where she'll likely get an earful from residents."

All but Gilmore ""have qualified thus far and have received invitations,"" they said in a statement.Earlier this year CNN said candidates must meet certain criteria, including an average of 1 percent of support in three recent national polls. CNN's latest poll released showed Gilmore at the bottom of the pack with less than one percent.""Additional candidates will receive invitations if they meet all of the previously released debate criteria."" CNN and the library said.Like last week's Republican presidential debates hosted by Fox News, the CNN event will actually be two debates - dividing the crowded Republican field into two groups, with one featuring the top 10 candidates.Although nearly all of the candidates made the cut for the CNN event, it is still unclear how the field will look a month from now when CNN and the library determine how to split the group based on their standing as of Sept. 10.Gilmore, who was governor of Virginia from 1998-2002 and previously made a brief run for the presidency in 2008, also has until then to try to boost his recognition among voters to make the cut.

So it's not totally surprising that he crowed about his prospects for the White House. But Trump may have tipped America off about his eventual run for president in a pair of books he authored in the 1990s.In classic Trump fashion, he dismissed politics as a career path not worthy of man of his stature -- but not before noting that he ""might just be able to get away with it because people tend to like me.""“People have always asked me if I’ll ever be involved in politics,"" he wrote in Trump: The Art of the Comeback. ""It seems every so often there’s some unfounded rumor that I’m considering seeking office -- sometimes even the presidency! The problem is, I think I’m too honest, and perhaps too controversial, to be a politician.""""I always say it like it is, and I’m not sure that a politician can do that, although I might just be able to get away with it because people tend to like me,"" he added. ""Honesty causes controversy, and therefore, despite all the polls that say I should run, I would probably not be a very successful politician.""The celebrity hotelier also addressed the prospect of jumping into politics in 1990's Trump: Surviving at the Top, which he wrote at a far more turbulent period in his life, facing a costly divorce battle and financial woes. Here, too, he described politics as an unseemly profession too beholden to elites and voters alike -- which is interestingly part of his pitch to ""Make America Great Again.""“Whenever I’ve taken a stand like that in public, people ask me if I have any plans to run for elective office. The answer is no. I’m not a politician. I wouldn’t want to get involved in the compromises, the glad-handling, and all the other demeaning things you have to do to get votes,"" Trump wrote.""But do I think I could get elected? At one time I would have said yes, probably. But now, since my marital problems and business pressures have been dragged through the newspapers, I’m less sure,"" he added. ""In any case, I’d have to face one big obstacle if I ever did make a serious run for public office: Americans have become so accustomed to professional politicians that when they are faced with a strong personality -- a man or woman of action -- they are afraid, or at least very wary. The fact is that there is a certain logic in the professional politicians’ reluctance to take a strong stand. Toughness is scary.”Apparently not so scary for Republican primary voters, who have largely stuck with Trump after controversial comments about Mexican immigrants and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a lackluster performance at the first GOP debate and his public feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly."

It prohibits “exhibiting disorderly conduct” that “unreasonably obstructs the usual use of entrances, foyers, lobbies, corridors, offices, elevators, stairways, or parking lots.”It wasn't clear if all 57 protesters who were arrested were charged under the same law. Many had been processed and released by Monday evening.The charge is considered a “petty offense” -- which still can lead to a criminal record. Thousands of such cases are adjudicated quietly in federal courts across the country, often by the mere payment of a fine.But the adjudication of federal petty offenses has been criticized for not affording defendants the constitutional protections associated with more serious criminal charges -- such as the right to an attorney for poor defendants or the right to a jury trial.As drafted, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which control in these cases, are rife with caveats to move these cases through the system more quickly.According to the local rules of the Eastern District of Missouri, the federal courthouse where the protests took place, activists could choose to pay the “forfeiture of collateral” -- a glorified term for the payment of a fine, after which the case ostensibly goes away. But the rules are unclear if doing so would amount to a guilty plea, which may have adverse consequences because it would remain on the defendant’s record. Or they could fight the charges in court, for which they would need to be represented by an attorney. If they lose, the maximum penalty activists face is 30 days in jail, a fine, or both.But in practice and depending on a number of factors -- including each defendant’s prior criminal history, the quality of the legal representation, or even the whims of the prosecutor -- the charges could be dismissed. Some federal districts allow for “deferred prosecutions,” a type of probationary period after which the charges go away if the person stays out of trouble.It's possible prosecutors want to play hardball. Federal authorities may consider the case to be of enough public salience to make an example out of the protesters. Stay tuned.Ryan J. Reilly contributed reporting. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified the procedure some federal prosecutors may invoke in low-priority cases. It is a ""deferred prosecution,"" not an ""adjournment in contemplation of dismissal."""

Major hospitals have been experimenting with the use of Google Glass since the first prototype was released in 2013. The latest evidence for Glass's utility in the medical field is a study by a team at the UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, which has used Google Glass to help diagnose and treat patients arriving at the hospital ER with symptoms of poisoning.For the study, emergency room residents confronting a case of suspected poisoning would first call a toxicology expert on the telephone, as usual, to reach a preliminary diagnosis. But they would then don a specially programmed Google Glass and go to the patient's bedside to stream video, audio and photos of the patient to the expert in real time.The study's authors reported on the results of 18 such consultations. The information from Glass led the remote experts to change their diagnosis in four of these cases, and to change their therapeutic recommendation in 10 of the cases, or 56 percent.Dr. Edward Boyer, one of the authors, told The Huffington Post in an email that Glass is particularly well-suited to toxicology because diagnosing the cause of a poisonings is largely done using visual cues, in contrast to other specialties that rely more on diagnostic testing. ""Glass allows a detailed image of the clinical findings of the physical examination to be transmitted to an expert,"" Boyer explained. ""Instead of hearing a doctor say, 'I don't know what he's got, but he looks weird,' I can now see specific traits in a patient with red, dry skin [and] large pupils [who] is feebly picking at things and has mumbling speech. That lets me diagnose a specific toxic condition and determine therapy.""Dr. Peter Chai, another author, added that telemedicine in general is a crucial part of toxicology because few hospitals -- especially small ones in rural areas -- have expert toxicologists on staff. Chai added that Google Glass is far better suited to the physical environment of hospital clinics than most competing technologies.""With a wearable device like Glass, the physician is able to turn any part of any ER into an advanced telemedicine suite without investment in bulky hardware by just walking into the room,"" Chai said. Boyer said that he believes the main barrier to hospitals' use of Google Glass for toxicology is the cost of the device -- especially given that poison control centers offer doctors diagnostic help over the phone for free. Others have said that products such as Glass raise concerns about patient privacy, though several companies have developed software that allows Glass to comply with federal patient privacy laws.Another obstacle is, of course, the waning of Google's support for Glass. The company is still actively pursuing business applications for the product -- including medicine. And toxicology is just one area of interest for doctors; some have also used Google Glass to assist with dermatology, neurology and even surgery.If these other areas prove as promising as toxicology, hospitals could end up being a crucial market for Google. In other words, the key to saving Google Glass may be saving lives. "
9,ARTS & CULTURE,"With The Help Of A Scroll Bar, 'Swim Thru Fire' Tells A Gripping, Immersive Story",Jillian Capewell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/swim-thru-fire-web-comics_us_55c279b7e4b0923c12bb6a7c,How comic artists use digital space to their advantage.,2015-08-11,"<p><em><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: #eeeeee;"">A portion of ""Swim Thru Fire.""</span></em></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c27e351400002e002e2146.png?cache=Qbhzyzlduf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Swim Thru Fire,” a serialized comic featured on Penguin Random House Canada’s Hazlitt magazine, is today’s best argument for comics on the Web.The series, now in its fifth installment on the site, centers around Ada, a mermaid who lives underwater among others of her kind, undulating plants and large whales. She makes contact with the surface when she rescues a woman researcher who’s been thrown overboard. The story continues from there, both on the research boat and in the water, with co-creator Annie Mok’s writing and Sophia Foster-Dimino’s art laying down broad brushstrokes of setting, characterization and feeling.When discussing their comic on the “Young Talk” podcast, Mok described the vision of the story as “loosely a retelling of The Little Mermaid,” Hans Christian Andersen’s classic tale of a mermaid who gives up her identity to obtain a human soul for the love of a prince. In the comic, the mermaids are there, but the prince becomes a female researcher.“I identify as a trans woman; all my protagonists for my fictional work are trans people, usually trans women,” Mok explained to The Huffington Post in an email. “There have been a lot of trans readings of The Little Mermaid, and certainly Hans Christian Andersen was a queer person who had been abused. I identified with the hurt, desire and outsider feelings he put into that story.”The series would be a masterpiece in any form, but what strikes immediately is the framing: one long, continuous panel that the reader must scroll down to read. It’s an effect that ties the art form to its digital home; the act of moving down the page conveys the depth, both literally and figuratively, of the story at hand. One scrolls further down, unsure of how far from the beginning they are, curious about how deep it might go -- not dissimilar to a plunge into the cold sea. To describe her and artist Foster-Dimino’s dual efforts, Mok turns to other known collaborators. “Jeff Parker compared his comic book scripts for Steve Lieber to what silent movie scripts might be like, and I do the same,” she said, recounting how she gives Foster-Dimino “stage directions with notes on what the characters are thinking and feeling.” From there, Foster-Dimino draws the strip.“I think of how Billy Strayhorn wrote and arranged for Duke Ellington, and then Duke and Johnny Hodges and the rest of Duke’s orchestra fleshed the song out, improvised, and made it real,” Mok said.Mok’s background as a comic artist helps as well. “Our process maybe involves more back-and-forth than the standard writer-artist pipeline used in mainstream comics, but I think the rhythm we've come up with is much better for both of us in terms of creative payoff,” Foster-Dimino wrote to HuffPost in an email. “She cooked up the notion to keep the ocean parts very flowing and open, and to make the parts on the boat all hard edges and constrictions,” Mok said of Foster-Dimino. “Like any story, it's a story in part about contrasts, and her choices draw out and build upon nuances suggested in the scripts.”Foster-Dimino noted that this collaboration was the first one she's worked on specifically for the Web. “Many people have loved the scrolling, and it’s been incredibly fun for me as an artist to solve compositional problems when you have no vertical boundaries.”In “Swim Thru Fire,” its digital home is not merely an afterthought or at odds with the story’s structure; it works directly with it.The comic is one example of how artists can use digital screens to their advantage. “I’d like to see more online platforms offer legitimate, well-paying opportunities for cartoonists, and I’d also like to see cartoonists push what can be done on the Web,” Foster-Dimino said, noting that comics are seldom outfitted for a smartphone screen, typically looking better on a tablet or computer. She admires fellow artist Maré Odomo for occasionally tailoring comics for mobile viewing, “since viewing images on a phone is a special kind of intimate experience.""""There is something about the space of a Web page that is uncanny, inherently ... because you don’t know when it will end. With a book, you know where you are,” Foster-Dimino added on the ""Young Talk"" podcast. ""It’s something you can physically hold in your hands, you have control over it and shut it in your hands if it scares you ... Web comics have the power to be much more manipulative.”Artist Emily Carroll, author of graphic story collection Through the Woods, is also known for producing Web comics that take advantage of digital spaces, using GIFs to add surprise and tension in a way that paper cannot. Clicking on a comic from Carroll’s homepage takes a reader to a black-background site, her creations front and center. At the bottom of each scroll, “next” buttons tell you that there’s more to come -- but there’s no telling what it could be, and for how long it will last. She cites fellow artist Jen Lee, creator of ""Thunderpaw,"" as another creator using GIFs and online tools in innovative ways. Carroll noted she draws faster on a tablet, ""which means I can get mistakes out of the way quicker and correct myself more easily."" In traditional work, ""I can get very sloppy -- I smear ink a lot, I get fingerprints everywhere -- and when I mess up a drawing, I tend to get frustrated and scrap the entire thing.""Interestingly, Carroll doesn’t see the print versus digital dilemma as ""an either/or situation"" in the comic world. ""There's things you can do online that would be impossible to do in print,"" she told HuffPost in an email. Online spaces are typically more accessible for artists in terms of publication and exposure -- it's faster and easier to share a link or a graphic online than to send them in the mail, or secure a spot selling them in-person at a convention. This advantage becomes all the more significant when one considers the unlimited space online to host the typically untold stories from authors in marginalized groups. Mok noted that most of the comics she considers radical are found online or in self-published zines. Though these are a useful starting point, traditional publishing hasn't quite caught up. ""Most small presses and even micropresses remain somewhat hidebound politically,"" Mok said in an email. ""For example, the number of black cartoonists that have had books published by Fantagraphics and Drawn & Quarterly [two major comics publishers] can be counted on one or two hands.""Citing the alienating ""R. Crumb mold for indie cartoonists as sad sack, angry misogynist white boys,"" Mok finds fewer radical voices in comics than in similar music and zine scenes. Despite the grim landscape, there's still hope: ""I feel very excited about a number of voices,"" she said, listing the The Response, Sab Meynert, Cathy G. Johnson, Higu Rose and Aatmaja Pandya, to name a few, as some inspiring voices that challenge norms in the cartoonist world.With ""Swim Thru Fire,"" Mok and Foster-Dimino can also add their own names to that list.

10,CRIME,NYPD Union Responds To Calls For Reform By Shaming The Homeless,Simon McCormack,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nypd-union-homeless_us_55ca27dbe4b0f1cbf1e656b7,"Memo calls officials fighting for police accountability ""inept and spineless.""",2015-08-11,<p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed to veto legislation that would make it illegal for police officers to put suspects in a chokehold.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fed up with calls for more oversight of police, one of the New York City Police Department's biggest unions offered a response: Take pictures of homeless New Yorkers and post them on the Internet.Sgt. Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, outlined the new campaign -- called ""Peek-A-Boo, We See You Too!"" -- in a memo to members this week.Mullins first decries efforts by the City Council to pass various pieces of NYPD reform legislation. One such bill would make it illegal for members of the NYPD to put a suspect in a chokehold. The legislation was inspired by the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was put in a chokehold and died after police questioned him about selling untaxed cigarettes.Another bill would require the NYPD to report how often officers use force.""The naysayers are our inept and spineless public officials who sit amongst the City Council and propose legislation that can only be described as preposterously disingenuous,"" Mullins says in the memo. ""We, the 'Good Guys,' are sworn to protect our citizens. Shouldn’t our public officials be held to the same standard?""After mocking the legislative proposals, Mullins describes the new campaign.""Today, I am asking each of you, along with your friends, family members and the silent majority of New Yorkers, to get more involved,"" Mullins says. ""As you travel about the City of New York, please utilize your smart phones to photograph the homeless lying in our streets, aggressive panhandlers, people urinating in public or engaging in open-air drug activity, and quality of life offenses of every type.""The results of this call to action can be seen on the campaign's Flickr page. Dozens of photos of the city's homeless cover the home page.SBA spokesman Jordan Bieber told The Huffington Post the campaign is designed to ""generate awareness that the number of homeless people around the city is growing.""Bieber referred all further questions to Mullins, who did not immediately respond.Public officials are well aware of the city's growing homeless population and are looking at different ways to address it.Research has shown that one of the best and most cost-effective ways to alleviate homelessness is not to take pictures of homeless people or arrest them, but to give them homes.Also on HuffPost:"
11,POLITICS,Campaign Finance Reformers Finally Get The Campaign They've Longed For In Donald Trump,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-campaign-finance-reformers_us_55ca0f55e4b0923c12be1a13,He's somehow become both a vocal critic and the personification of the problems of money in politics.,2015-08-11,<p>Donald Trump said he donated to Hillary Clinton so that she would come to his wedding. Clinton said she attended because Trump is entertaining. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Though it's unlikely his intent, real estate mogul Donald Trump is delighting campaign finance reform activists with his theatrical presidential bid.In recent weeks, the Republican presidential candidate essentially admitted he used his personal wealth to bribe politicians, taunted opponents over past requests they made for his donations, and revealed he gave money to Hillary Clinton to ensure her attendance at his wedding.""I will tell you that our system is broken,"" he said at the recent GOP debate. ""I gave to many people. Before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. And that's a broken system.""Even for a candidate without much polish, such an admission seems overly candid. For those who warn about the pernicious flow of money into politics, however, it's been wonderfully revealing, an actual told-ya-so moment.""I think unlike many of the other things that Donald Trump has said, this certainly goes right to a basic truth about the political system,"" said Nick Nyhart, president and CEO of the group Every Voice Center. ""Essentially a private money system is built on quid pro quo politics. The interesting thing for me also is that while the other candidates have criticized him on other issues, none have criticized him on a pretty bold assertion about what is the root of privately financed campaigns.""Trump doesn't risk, at this juncture at least, being mistaken for a good governance apostle. There is no apparent white paper outlining what campaign finance reforms he'd like to see. And his campaign didn't return a request for those details. Moreover, for some reform advocates, his criticisms of the current system are muddled by his own ambitions. More than any candidate in the race, Trump personifies how wealth correlates with one's political influence.""We object to both the existing campaign finance systems: The one Trump is attacking that allows billionaires to buy influence with presidential candidates, and also the one that billionaire Trump is using to try and buy the presidential election with his own money,"" said Fred Wertheimer, founder and president of the nonprofit Democracy 21. ""His comments touch on one of the big problems but leave out another big problem that he is taking advantage of.""Still, for Wertheimer and other good government officials, it's been a bit of a guilty pleasure to watch Trump pull back the curtain on how money drives the political process. Nearly every candidate in the presidential race (on both sides of the aisle) has expressed discomfort with a culture that requires so much dialing for dollars and sees unlimited funds sent to groups loosely associated with campaigns. But, save for a few, they all partake in the system, soliciting big-money donations and essentially sanctioning allied super PACs for fear that if they didn't, the competition would be at an advantage. Trump, by contrast, has declared himself impervious to big-moneyed interests by the mere act of already being one of them. He has pointedly declared that he donated to politicians of both parties because, “when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.” And, recently, he mocked fellow Republican presidential candidates for flocking to a confab held by the industrialist Koch brothers -- who pledged to spend $900 million or so this election.“I’m excited he is saying this,"" said Harvard Law professor Larry Lessig, who is launching a presidential campaign of his own to spotlight the need for campaign finance reform. ""It is giving credibility to something people have been saying for a long time.”Whether Trump remains a vocal critic of the campaign finance system could depend on how far his candidacy goes. Already, he has loaned himself $1.8 million, while raising just $92,000 from individual contributions and spending a robust $1.4 million prior to the end of June ($21,685 of that on fundraising consulting). For a person of prodigious wealth, this burn and loan rate may be sustainable. But Trump could very well decide he's done writing his own checks and begin looking for other, fellow billionaires to help pick up part of the tab. This would make him a hypocrite, perhaps, but not exactly a felon.""Political fundraising and contributions is the soft underbelly of politics and ultimately governing if you’re elected,"" said Ken Gross, a campaign finance attorney at the firm Skadden Arps. ""It is something that you just as well would not talk about. That having been said, it is not illegal."""

The five administrative claims filed Monday, which could lead to federal lawsuits, mark the latest jab against the Obama administration’s policy of detaining mothers and their children together in order to dissuade Central American migrants to cross illegally into the United States and ask for asylum.One of the women, Yancy Mejía, traveled with her 4-year-old son by land from El Salvador into the United States in March. She says she no longer felt safe in her home country after a gang abducted her for five days and raped her, only releasing her when her mother paid a $4,000 ransom. She arrived in the United States with twisted fingers that had been broken during the gang’s beatings.But at the Southern Texas Family Residential Center, a family detention center built in December in the Texas town of Dilley, she says staff refused to help treat the painful fractures and referred to her and other detainees as “f**king migrants” who “came to invade their country.”She says staff declined to give medical attention to her child, who vomited repeatedly and refused to eat. Instead, medical staff told her to give the child water because he was dehydrated. After several days, a group of lawyers helped press the center to send her son to a nearby hospital, where he was diagnosed with a virus that had caused an ear infection. He was treated there with antibiotics for five days, she said.“It was horrible living in that place,” Mejía, who was allowed to leave the Dilley detention center nine days ago with an ankle monitor while pursuing her asylum claim, told The Huffington Post. “I spent so much time suffering in that prison. We came to this country looking for help. It’s an injustice that they lock us up for months.”Another woman who filed a complaint, Celina Gutiérrez Cruz, told The Huffington Post last month that her child vomited blood repeatedly for a week before guards at the Dilley detention center finally took her to an off-site medical facility to receive treatment. Prior to that, medical staff told Gutiérrez Cruz to have her 6-year-old daughter drink water. As with many other asylum seekers locked in family detention, ICE has refused to allow Gutiérrez Cruz or her daughter leave the facility, even though she passed a “reasonable fear” interview with an asylum officer -- the first step toward establishing a “withholding of removal” claim, which is similar to asylum but provides fewer protections and requires a higher level of scrutiny.Gutiérrez Cruz, 22, says she fled Honduras after a gang tried to force her to traffic drugs and serve as a “concubine.” Members of the gang beat her and then threatened to kill her daughter if she refused, she says. A psychological evaluation found that both she and her daughter suffer from PTSD.“They said they would take my daughter away from me and kill her,” Gutiérrez told HuffPost by phone last month from detention. “That’s why I took the decision to come here. But I didn’t know that I would be locked up for so long. ... Why don’t they let us out?”Treatment by guards at the family detention centers caused the detainees to suffer damages including “physical pain and suffering,” as well as “mental and emotional pain and anguish,” according to the filing.“Each one of these five women has stepped forward to bear witness to the reality of what’s happening in the government’s refugee family internment camps,"" Andrew Free, who represents detainees locked in family detention as part of the CARA Pro Bono Project, told HuffPost. ""Each one of these five women and their children have been held hostage to a government narrative that is deliberately misleading. The government wants the courts and the general public to believe that these people are economic migrants who come here seeking work and a better life. … But the overwhelming majority of the women and children that are coming here are looking only for the safety and refuge of longstanding asylum laws, and the government does not want to allow them to have access to it.""A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said ICE does not comment on pending litigation, but defended the agency’s general handling of mothers and children locked in its detention centers.“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care,"" the statement said. ""The agency is committed to ensuring that individuals housed in our family residential centers receive timely and appropriate medical health care. ICE’s family residential standards are designed to provide onsite health care and remote specialized services as needed for all residents.""The Obama administration largely abandoned family detention in 2009 in the face of continued protests. But following an influx of some 68,000 family units last year -- the vast majority of them from the poverty- and violence-plagued Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras -- the administration expanded family detention once more.Federal officials added bed space for families at the Karnes County Residential Center in Texas, and constructed an entirely new one at Dilley. Both family detention centers are run as for-profit enterprises. Corrections Corporation of America, the country’s largest private prison contractor, runs the Dilley detention center, while GEO Group, the second-largest contractor, runs the Karnes detention center.Both centers have generally defended their handling of detainees in family detention, while referring more specific questions to ICE.A federal judge ruled last month that detaining mothers with their children violates the 1997 Flores Settlement, which requires authorities to detain undocumented children in the least restrictive environment possible and to generally favor a policy of releasing them. The government asked the judge last week to reconsider the ruling, arguing that it had improved its family detention policies but still wanted to detain migrant families for periods of roughly three weeks to screen their asylum claims.
