At 5-foot-10, they make him look smaller.",2012-11-26,"This film image released by Columbia Pictures shows Daniel Craig as James Bond in the action adventure film, ""Skyfall."" (AP Photo/Sony Pictures, Francois Duhamel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8d2026000033007f85de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The latest offering in the James Bond oeuvre, Skyfall, does a few things right but when it comes to 007 and his sartorial style, it makes a mockery of the Ian Fleming-created icon played by Sir Sean Connery.Bond purists have already had to deal with an English Secret Service agent as played by Pierce Brosnan (who should have brought his suits from Remington Steele) converting to Brioni, a high-style Italian house for his suitings. A venerable house, but with its padded shoulders, high arm-holes and narrow fit, a far too flashy look for Bond. What do you expect from a Bond who drives a BMW rather than an Aston Martin?Fleming gives us a window into Bond's style in his early books.Bond wears only white shirts, a solid blue or charcoal grey suit and a black knit tie. This is precisely what Sean Connery wore in Goldfinger when... eh... dressed to kill.The problem in Skyfall in a nutshell? Daniel Craig's slim-cut suits are too tight, too narrow shouldered and too small. At 5-foot-10, they make him look smaller.The suits for Daniel Craig in Skyfall were designed by costume designer Jany Temime and made by someone who surely knows better, Tom Ford. They look more like the work of Thomas Browne (known for his short, tight and close fitting suits for younger men) for in Skyfall all of Bonds suits, his evening clothes and his topcoat are too small and too tight. 007 shouldn't be wearing suits better suited to Pee Wee Herman or Curly Howard of the Three Stooges.Even worse Mr. Craig suits are too short, a style called a ""bum-freezer"" during World War II when their were fabric shortages. Agent 007 shouldn't leave his ass uncovered. A shorter jacket makes a short man look shorter. Craig is a mere 5-foot-10. Villain Javier Bardem is 6 foot. No wonder Craig looks small in their fight scenes.I have no real quarrel with the superb fabrics and somber palette of colors chosen by Ms. Temime and Mr. Ford. The tab-collar is, of course, a reach as Bond wore a medium white spread collar but at least it's a 60's look.Incredibly Ms. Temime cops to making the clothes too small believing Mr. Craig is like Batman in a spandex bodysuit, made to show every sinew of his muscle. On Bond's too-tight suit: ""I don't have any problem with Bond running or driving a motorcycle in a suit, because a suit is a second skin in that case,"" said Temime. Craig is not a large man and despite his great physique the suits make him look diminutive on film. The Jany/Ford suits minimize the star of the movie. They make him smaller than life.""To me, it was very important to show that body, and have that second-skin effect. Yes, you see the leg muscle, and I wanted that."" Ms. Temime told The New York Times. This woman should be costuming the next Batman movie. Her slim-cut suits actually shrink Bond. A suit, unlike sports or casual clothing is not supposed to fit like a second suit. A Beau Brummel said ""a gentlemen's clothes should never be too new or too tight.""In fact emphasizing the athleticism of the wearer is the whole point of the school of fine English tailoring as favored by 007 in the Fleming books and Connery movies. The English school's military roots accentuate easy movement, a full chest, natural shoulder and nipped waist while giving a secret agent the ease of motion to duke it out with a villain or grab for the gun. At the same time the English silhouette emphasizes a powerful upper body and the subtle V-shaped back.In all cases Craig's slim-cut suits are restricting. Craig's suits are so tight the pull everywhere and it's most unflattering. A suit should have clean lines, and Mr. Craig's suits don't. The suits violate all principles of good tailoring.How should Bond's suits look?Says The Suits of James Bond website: ""The final scene of Goldfinger features Sean Connery in his second three-piece suit of the series, a charcoal grey woolen flannel.....Bond would sometimes wear a waistcoat (what Americans call a vest) as in this shark-skin three piece ensemble. The slim-cut suits chose by Ms. Temine are decidedly in fashion for younger men but not for Mr. Craig who despite his chiseled physique is getting long in the tooth to play the middle-aged agent on her Majesty's Secret Service.Ms. Temime defends the choice of the slim-cut suit because the cut is currently fashionable thus confusing fashion and style. ""And that's why everybody fancies those suits. They're hot."" she told the Times. Fashion is fleeting, Ms. Temime. James Bond's style endures."

It is the beginning.,2012-11-26,"In this Wednesday, Oct. 24, 2012 photo, passengers are scanned at a Terminal C security checkpoint at Logan Airport in Boston using a millimeter wave body scanner, which produces a cartoon-like outline rather than naked images of passengers produced by a similar machine using X-rays. The Transportation Security Administration is deploying more of the millimeter waveￂﾠmachines at seven major U.S. airportsￂﾠwhere the agency is removing all of the full-body X-ray scanners that have been criticized by privacy advocates. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8c933c0000660009cd96.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To absolutely no one's surprise, the mainstream media last week ignored a legitimate grassroots protest against the TSA's allegedly invasive full-body scanners.Oh sure, there were whispers of National Opt-Out Week here and there. The trade publication Government Security News reported them, although it left readers with the impression that this action would fizzle. A lone op-ed in a New Jersey newspaper recognized the protest and supported it.The TSA briefly acknowledged Opt-Out Week in a blog post that came across as both wooden and threatening. Wooden, in the sense that it described the opt-out options in almost clinical terms; and threatening in the sense that it implied passengers could be arrested for taking photos of the screening process (""While the TSA does not prohibit photographs at screening locations, local laws, state statutes or local ordinances may,"" it warned).But most media outlets -- staffed by junior editors and wide-eyed interns during the American Thanksgiving week -- simply blew off Opt-Out Week.They're cluelessThey don't understand. Opt-Out Week wasn't the end of the protest. It is the beginning.Organizers claim they made their point, bringing attention to a screening method that is, by some accounts, both dangerous and unconstitutional. Enough passengers made the pledge to opt out until the TSA decommissions these poorly tested machines, their numbers growing every day, that it's only a matter of time before screening areas reach gridlock.And then the TSA will have a decision to make. Does it abandon the last of these scanners and try something different? (It's already quietly backed away from the most controversial X-ray scanners.) Or does it double down on its foolish investment in an unproven technology, buying more machines, refusing to subject them to independent tests and insisting that the body-scanners are safe -- and that we should just take their word for it?I'm betting they'll unplug 'em.You're wrongMy story about opting out of the TSA's scanners last week drew a massive response on my consumer advocacy site, on the Huffington Post and on LinkedIn.Most of them were well intended but, unfortunately, terribly misguided. I'll summarize them here.""I'm not going to let my Thanksgiving vacation be held hostage to your little protest.""No worries. I flew last Monday, and I opted out, and there were no noticeable delays. In fact, there were no reports of delays anywhere, which makes me wonder if, like the last time we protested the scanners, TSA agents simply waved passengers through.That's what they did with me.""I'm a million-miler, elite-level frequent flier on [insert name of airline]. Your silly protest is disruptive to the rest of us who just need to get to their destination.""No you're not. Experienced business travelers avoid Thanksgiving week at all costs. Besides, if you're a real road warrior, you already have a TSA Pre-Check card, and might be able to breeze through security. Talk to the hand, my friend.""Your post was sensationalistic and irresponsible. The government has repeatedly reassured us that full-body scanners are safe, and can be used as a primary screening method. Also, my nephew, who is a TSA agent, says the machines are absolutely harmless.""Sometimes you've gotta cut through all the rhetoric and tell it like it is, and if you think that's sensationalistic, then I'm guilty as charged.I, for one, am not going to take the government's ""word"" that its scanners are safe, and I'm definitely not going to believe your nephew. Get a Ph.D, conduct an independent test on the scanners and then let's have a conversation.Say, why don't we all meet in that Texas warehouse where they've mothballed those X-ray scanners? We could do it between your nephew's chemotherapy treatments?""Air travel is a privilege, not a right.""Wrong. Freedom of movement is a recognized constitutional right. And air travel is a form of movement. Bottom line: You have the right to fly without being hassled.""Your post gave comfort to the enemy. I question your patriotism.""I question yours. Protesting the TSA's irresponsible screening methods isn't just my right as an American citizen; it's my duty. The enemy would be even more comforted if we didn't have this debate. That's a sure sign that the bad guys have won. Think about it.I understand some of your comments, though I disagree with many of them. Sometimes the rightness of your cause isn't apparent until it's in the rear view mirror. Only then does everything fall into place.I agree with the protesters. The TSA's wrongheaded scan/pat-down proposition raises basic health, privacy -- and yes, civil rights -- issues.Maybe someday you'll understand."

Police in upstate New York arrested Karl Karlsen on Friday following a probe into his 23-year-old son's 2008 death, the Syracuse Post-Standard reported. The 52-year-old father allegedly killed his son Levi to cash a hefty insurance policy that he took out only days before the so-called staged accident in the family's barn in the Finger Lake region, The original story, which investigators believed, was that Karlsen returned from a family event and discovered Levi pinned motionless, according to the Associated Press. He told his wife to call 911 while he made vain efforts to rescue him. Investigators took a second look at the case after learning in March that Karlsen was the sole beneficiary of a life insurance policy for his son. It raised suspicions because Levi has two daughters. Evidence at the crime scene in Romulus didn't paint the picture of an accident either, according to police who told CNYcentral.com that they determined the truck didn't fall from the jack. They now believe that Karlsen deliberately dropped the pickup on top of his son before leaving the house to attend the event. It's the first murder in rural Seneca County in more than a decade.Karlsen was held on second-degree murder charges. Joint effort of several local and state law enforcement agencies led to the arrest. The charges raise questions about the accidental death of Karlsen's first wife who was killed in a California home fire on New Year's Day in 1991. Investigators are looking at that case again to see if foul play could have been involved. Catharine's father Art Alexander told the Post Standard that he always suspected his son-in-law was responsible. Levi was one of three children rescued from the home that day. "

Anthony Kirby, Ernst & Young's director or regulatory and risk management, said companies are mostly moving existing staff into the compliance positions.""We had a team of 70 plus growing by 20 percent,"" Kirby said, referring to one of the companies surveyed. REGULATION MOUNTAINThe regulation explosion, along with a string of high profile scandals, means banks and fund managers are setting aside more money to improve their compliance and risk functions, which includes spending on risk technology and financial fraud detection systems.Compliance operations are being taken in-house, rather than being outsouced to law firms and freelancers as they often used to be prior to the financial crisis.Craig McNicol, manager of the credit, risk and quantitative finance team at the London office of recruitment firm Morgan McKinley, said risk functions had traditionally been filled by contractors commanding more than 1,000 pounds ($1,600) a day.""The market is shifting towards demand for permanent hires,"" he said.HSBC, reeling from money laundering problems at its Mexican subsidiary, for which it has set aside $700 million to cover fines, has doubled its annual spending on compliance since 2010 to more than $400 million.""We've heard numbers of anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of non-discretionary, non-risk-related budgets being reassigned to the risk function,"" said Michael Versace, Research Director at IDC Financial Insights.In addition to new laws, a driver behind the hiring spree is a desire to avoid ending up on the front page of the newspapers for the wrong reasons.The Libor scandal, along with Standard Chartered's recent run-in with U.S. regulators over Iran transactions -- not to mention a rogue trading scandal at UBS -- mean boards are more willing to sanction increased spending on compliance, despite it generating no revenue.A Thomson Reuters survey found 65 percent of compliance officers expected their budget to be higher this year than in 2011.But finding the right candidates to fill the new job vaccancies has not been easy.Some head hunters say professionals who have worked at regulators are in hot demand, although others say deep experience as a financial risk and compliance staffer is the ideal choice.""There are a lot of firms which are having to hire people that haven't had a dedicated compliance function before,"" said Philippa Allen, chief executive of consulting firm ComplianceAsia. ""There is a talent shortage."""

But the other things are all there so read on.For those who work on private military and security contracting (PMSC) issues one longstanding, and still vexing, issue is encapsulated in just three words, ""inherently governmental functions"" (IGF). Deciding what is IGF, and thus something only the government should do, and what isn't, meaning it is available for private contractors to do is not some arcane definitional issue. It is also a question the answer to which is worth hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars.And when it comes to whether security contracting, i.e., guys with guns, is an IGF, the vexation factors multiplies by orders of magnitude.Fortunately, a law journal article published last year offers some guidance and suggestions. Writing in Public Contract Law Journal earlier this year Anthony LaPlaca authored ""Settling the Inherently Governmental Functions Debate Once and for All: The Need for Comprehensive Legislation of Private Security Contractors in Afghanistan.""His article highlights the intrinsic problems with using PSCs in war zones, particularly those that are hired to perform inherently governmental functions and concludes that the Government's obscure mandate to keep PSCs from performing IGFs has proven meaningless in the context of the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, where PSCs regularly assume core military duties. To understand why, we need to consider, as everyone else in the world has recently been doing, retired Gen. David Petraeus. LaPlaca wroie:In 2006 American counterinsurgency strategy underwent a remarkable transformation. The War on Terror formerly resembled a campaign of attrition in which the principal strategy was to eradicate terrorist groups from the top down until they became too depleted to fight. This overarching approach changed when General David Petraeus circulated a counterinsurgency manual emphasizing that U.S. success in Iraq is contingent upon U.S. troops living and fraternizing with Iraqi citizens. Colloquially, Petreaus's proposition became known as ""winning the hearts and minds"" of the people. In LaPlaca's view the current policy on outsourcing in Afghanistan increases the dangers of mixing civilian contractors and military forces in war zonesIn theory the critical mechanism for minimizing the hazards of PSCs is the prohibition on IGFs]. In September 2011, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (""OFPP"") promulgated a final policy letter providing a uniform federal definition of IGFs] as prescribed by the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act (FAIR Act).The FAIR Act identifies IGFs as those functions ""so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by Federal Government employees. In addition to the FAIR Act, OMB Circular A-76 (A-76) dictates that the executive agencies, including the DoD, exclusively use government personnel to perform IGFs. A-76 instructs all agencies to explicitly distinguish between commercial functions that may be allocated to private contractors and IGFs, which may not.That seems clear. But the Government Accountability Office's take on IGFs stresses the importance of discretion. When determining whether a contract examiner performed IGFs, the GAO inquires whether the parties engaged in ""activities which necessitate either the exercise of discretion in applying government authority or the use of value judgment in making decisions for the government.""Why is this a problem? LaPlaca says:The ban on outsourcing IGFs encapsulates the intrinsic risks attributed to PSCs. Since IGFs constitute those activities that impact the public interest, it seems counterintuitive to assign such tasks to profit-driven entities, as opposed to soldiers who light out of allegiance to the citizenry. Moreover, because PSCs are not a part of the military chain of command, a lack of coordination between civilian contractors and soldiers can lead to severe tactical repercussions in areas where there is little margin for miscommunication. General Petraeus commented on the negative operational effects of working with PSCs, whose presence sometimes goes completely unnoticed by the ranking military official in the region.For that very reason the U.S. government considers some functions so inextricably tied to the public interest that it has forbidden DoD from outsourcing them. Department of Defense Instruction 1100.22 establishes the ""policies and procedures for determining the workforce mix"" of private sector and military personnel. This is perhaps the most detailed document elucidating the boundaries of security contracting. It includes a demonstrative list of IGFs that cannot be outsourced to the private sector, as well as a catalog of functions that are ""closely associated"" with IGFs.Yes, despite that the private security industry is everywhere in Afghanistan. The GAO has reported that over 4,200 DoD contractors currently perform jobs that are inherently governmental or unauthorized personal services. In addition, 45,934 PSCs are involved with activities deemed ""closely associated"" with IGFs. According to LaPlaca:An empirical overview of PSC performance yields the conclusion that ""corporate warriors are engaged in military duties that are, in many circumstances, identical to their counterparts in the national armed forces."" Persistent ambiguity concerning certain functions allows PSCs to traverse into the sphere of public activities.LaPlaca thinks that at its core the problems is once of concept, not definition.The conflicts surrounding PSCs do not suggest that the Government's policy on outsourcing security functions is wrong or misguided. Rather, the continual extension of PSCs into undesired fields of service hints that no set of words and phrases will ever fully constrain security contractors in the way that the Afghani Government and the U.S. Congress have requested. In other words, the problem with IGFs is one of substantive, not definitional, parameters. A fundamental change in how the Government conceptualizes IGFs is in order.To be fair, this outsourcing of IGF is not just the fault of the companies. ""Congress must recognize that legal ambiguity persists because it has sidestepped its duties to define IGFs, allowing the DoD and the OFPP to ordain federal contracting policies,"" according to LaPlacaIn his view the best hope for alleviating the IGF dilemma is an express legislative demarcation of activities that are inherently governmental, in lieu of reliance on the abstract and ineffectual characterization of IGFs currently in place. What he calls for is a core competencies model that calls upon Congress to demarcate three categories of security functions: absolute IGFs, commercial functions, and core capabilitiesFirst, if there is a consensus that a particular contractor service is inherently governmental, Congress should explicitly terminate all military outsourcing of said functions. Examples of absolute IGFs would include combat operations, maintenance of weapons systems, and any other role deemed adverse to the public interest.Commercial functions might include cooking and cleaning at military bases, chaplain services, static security, and any task perceived to pose little or no conflict with public policy. Finally, ""core capabilities"" are functions such as guarding convoys, training Afghani forces, or any other job that, depending on the facts and circumstances of the particular contract, belongs in the public sphere.After delineating which functions are IGFs, which are commercial, and which are core capabilities, Congress needs only to establish guidelines for deciding when it is appropriate to outsource core competencies. Listing criteria for approval or disapproval of a private contract that calls for the performance of core competencies ensures that the DoD consistently follows the prohibition on IGFs in good faith and that similarly situated firms bidding on certain contracts are given fair treatment. The ultimate decision whether to hire a given PSC must depend on a totality of the various factors relevant to each individual contract."

The whole world seemed to praise a new novel in terms so rapturous you'd think nobody had ever accomplished anything worth praising in fiction until then. I'd read the book and go, ""Huh?""That's how I feel about Skyfall. Its almost unanimous raves had me set for a movie experience of a lifetime, or at least the best Bond movie in 50 years, but I was bored. How bored? More than once, I considered walking out, getting some coffee nearby and meeting my spouse afterwards.The opening sequence was simply sub-par Bond, a routine chase with very little magic or excitement, and many other films have worked with trains to much better effect, even ones as silly as Broken Arrow or Under Siege 2. And while we're on trains, the Tube crash later in the film was unbelievably bland, as droopy as the movie itself. Die Hard With a Vengeance had a much scarier and more dramatically filmed crash. But then all the way through Skyfall, I kept seeing other movies referenced: Mission Impossible, The International, Inception, The Lady from Shanghai, X-Men, The Woman in Black. For me, these visual quotes made Skyfall suffer, because those films all moved better, had smarter and more involving scripts.Skyfall's story was full of holes -- like the pathetically weak security surrounding M -- and became duller and duller until the final shoot-out, which was something right out of a thousand Westerns. As for the much-praised Javier Bardem ""gay"" villain -- what did he do or say that was different from any other screwed-up gay psycho in the last few decade of movies? Getting ready to see Skyfall, I watched and enjoyed Casino Royale and even the lesser Quantum of Solace for their color, action, and life. But the overwhelming stench of nostalgia, regret, decay and desuetude in Skyfall -- perfectly symbolized by that grim Scottish manse -- made me wonder if this was supposed to be a eulogy. I hadn't come to bury Bond, but to cheer him on.The only bright notes? Craig's biceps and Ben Wishaw's hair."
