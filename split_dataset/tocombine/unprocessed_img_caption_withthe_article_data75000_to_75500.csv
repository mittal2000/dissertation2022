0,BUSINESS,What Women Can Learn From Paul Ryan. Really.,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-paul-ryan_us_5627b2efe4b0bce347033ffb,"Nevermind the hypocrisy, the man is on to something about work-life balance.",2015-10-21,Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) says that he won't take the job of House speaker unless he can maintain his work-life balance.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paul Ryan may not support any policies that help working women, but this week he did something that all working women can actually learn from. He clearly asked for what he needed at work in order to successfully balance his needs as a father of three young children.""I cannot and will not give up my family time,"" said the Republican representative from Wisconsin, explaining that he would only take the position of House speaker if he could continue to have time to spend with his wife and three young kids. He had some other demands, as well, about Republican unity.Ryan's demand for family time is emblematic of how younger generations are beginning to think about the workplace. Millennials and even Gen Xers like the 45-year-old Ryan don't necessarily want to sacrifice their family to the altar of their career -- even if they're holding big-shot fancy-pants political or corporate jobs.""Younger generations want more balance, and unless people demand changes, companies are just going to react they way they always have,"" Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon who does a lot of work on gender in the workplace, told HuffPost Wednesday morning. In other words: Unless you speak up, most companies will continue to work you -- until you break.At this point, most younger adults -- particularly millennials -- seem to agree that you shouldn't have to work all the time at the expense of having a life. Still, there's a big-time reticence, particularly among women, to speak up about this issue in the office. Instead, many women and men just quietly suffer through their work lives until they burn out and quit or ask for a scaled-down role. Some men just pretend to work all the time, as one recent study showed.Ryan, on the other hand, is being upfront about what he wants. More of us should be -- even though there's potential for backlash. Particularly for women.Men face less hostility when they ask for family time, as study after study has noted. Most people applaud a man who wants to be with his family.""Women get a different reaction,"" Babcock said. ""People think 'Oh, she's not serious.' There is still a double-standard.""Women should understand that in standing up for what they need, there could be consequences, Babcock added.But if more of us try, it's going to be harder to isolate us. And it helps that high-profile men like Ryan are out there making noise about this. Some workplaces are trying to make it easier for workers to speak up. ""We want to create an environment for people to say what they need,"" Ellyn Shook, the chief human resource officer at Accenture told HuffPost this summer.Even the most senior women at the consulting firm don't necessarily ask for what they want, she said. And sometimes it's nothing that major: like someone who wants to always show up at her daughter's dance class on Wednesday afternoons. Part of Shook's mission is making sure people know it's cool to bring these things up. And any good boss should operate that way, of course. The idea is not to put the onus entirely on an employee's shoulders.Of course, it's worth noting that not all workers have the luxury of making demands on their bosses -- especially those who work at lower-paying jobs.Ryan, it seems safe to say, doesn't really work in the most supportive of environments. Some conservatives were openly hostile to the idea of a man who was concerned with spending time with family, as HuffPost's Sam Stein noted.Even in 2015, there's an expectation that men should seek power and ""family takes a back seat,"" Stein writes.That's the expectation that actually underlies a lot of the thinking behind Republican policy -- which makes Ryan's demands more than a little ironic, as many have noted.In 2009, Ryan voted against a bill that would've given paternity leave to federal employees, Jezebel pointed out. He and his party also oppose federally mandated paid family leave. Part of the general rationale there is: If women stay home and don't hold full-time jobs, why would you need paid maternity leave? (The rest has to do with ""corporate freedom."")""Perhaps if Paul Ryan hadn’t spent much of his political career fighting laws that promote realistic work-life balance for parents of all socioeconomic levels,"" Jezebel's Erin Gloria Ryan writes, ""Asking for family time would make him look more like a hero and less like a hypocrite.""Maybe so, but that doesn't mean we can't pluck some wisdom from the wreckage of the hypocrisy."
1,POLITICS,Justice Scalia Says He'll Retire Once He 'Can't Do The Job As Well',Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justice-scalia-retirement_us_5627ba31e4b08589ef4a1366,"The famously blunt justice also offered his take on ""dead white males"" and the death penalty.",2015-10-21,"Justice Antonin Scalia suggested that those who really deplore the Constitution should ""lead a revolution.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_42_219_2162_1380%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Justice Antonin Scalia isn't stepping down from the U.S. Supreme Court soon, but he offered some clues Tuesday as to when he might.In a speech at the University of Minnesota Law School, the longest-serving justice currently on the court said he'll retire whenever he feels he's no longer quite up to the requirements of the job.""As soon as I think I'm getting lazier and I just can't do the job as well, I'm going to get off there. I want to preserve whatever reputation I have,"" Scalia said, according to The Associated Press. ""If you've lost your smarts, yeah, you should get off. But that hasn't been the case."" That particular comment came in response to an audience member's question. Scalia's wide-ranging address -- part of an annual lecture series at the law school that last year featured Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- also touched on broader aspects of his judicial philosophy and controversial topics such as the death penalty.As a supporter of originalism -- a legal philosophy that holds the Constitution ought to be interpreted as its drafters originally understood it -- Scalia rejected one counter-argument that the Constitution's adoption by ""dead white males"" undercuts its validity in modern times.""Look, you either accept the Constitution as a valid document. Or you reject it. But you can't play it both ways,"" he said, according to local online publication MinnPost.You ""can't say the Constitution's valid in the way the House and the Senate are composed,"" the justice said, but then attack other sections on the grounds that they were ""adopted by dead white males.""""You gotta be consistent,"" he said. Scalia went on to offer what seemed like a suggestion to those who seek to substantially rewrite the founding document: ""If you believe what you say, you should lead a revolution.""On the subject of capital punishment, which the Supreme Court will be debating a number of times in the coming months, Scalia reprised comments from September, when he said it ""wouldn't surprise me"" if the current court struck down the death penalty as unconstitutional.Barring such formal invalidation, he told Tuesday's audience of more than 2,700 that the court has already erected procedural barriers to the death penalty that have made it ""practically impossible to impose it.""Earlier this month, the court heard two cases -- one from Kansas and the other from Florida -- exploring the limits that the Constitution places on the sentencing schemes of states that still execute people. In the Kansas case, Scalia took a swipe in open court at Justice Stephen Breyer, who made headlines in June when he expressed a desire to, once and for all, reconsider the constitutionality of the death penalty.""Kansans, unlike our Justice Breyer, do not think the death penalty is unconstitutional and indeed very much favor it,"" Scalia said at the time.Besides those two cases and the flurry of last-minute bids from inmates wishing to halt their executions -- all of which have been denied -- the justices are scheduled to hear a pair of cases out of Georgia and Pennsylvania that examine the constitutionality of the trial procedures that states use to reach death sentences."

In 14 years on the job, the biggest tip Felber had received was $100.As Felber entered Begich Middle School, where the church meets for service, he was surprised to find the congregation cheering him on -- for what he initially thought would be an ordinary delivery.Pastor Dan Krause welcomed Felber to the front of the congregation.""How does a tip of $1,900 sound?"" Krause asked. ""Oh heck no,"" Felber replied.The church set a goal to raise $1,000, KTUU reported, but managed to raise $1,900 instead. ""We had the opportunity to bless somebody who had no idea,"" Krause said. ""We talked to a manager at a local pizza place who told us about an employee who has had some financial hardships due to some medical issues he's facing, and we decided, what a great opportunity as a church to bless somebody for no other reason than to bless them.""On the Facebook page associated with Chugach Covenant, the church hinted at their plan one day earlier, by posting a story about a Domino's Pizza driver in Ohio, who was given a $1,046 donation by the Sycamore Creek Church as part of its ""I was Broke. Now I'm Not"" sermon series. Krause said in a Facebook post he is pleased his church could ""share some joy.""As for Felber, he told KTUU the money will help and he appreciated the congregation's thoughtfulness.

3,POLITICS,Top Cops Unite To Provide ‘Cover’ For Criminal Justice Reform,Ryan J.

These top cops have your six.",2015-10-21,"""Nobody here is weak on crime,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy says of the police group.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5627f2431400002a00c7a833.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A group of law enforcement leaders gathered in Washington on Wednesday to throw their support behind reducing the massive prison population in the United States, hoping their effort will provide “cover” for politicians and government officials to take on criminal justice reform.The group, Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, believes that incarceration levels in the U.S. “have reached a crisis point.” Their statement of principles says that if the prison population was a state, it would be bigger than Delaware, Vermont and Wyoming combined.And, as American politicians grapple with fixing the problems with the criminal justice system without opening themselves up to “soft on crime” attacks, the police officials say their effort should make it clear that it is possible to reduce arrests and prosecutions while maintaining public safety.“That’s exactly why we’re here, to give people the cover they need to express ideas that need to be expressed,” Garry McCarthy, the superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, told The Huffington Post. “You’re not going to find tougher cops than right here. You’re just not; they don’t exist. Nobody here is weak on crime. What we are strong on is results.” Members of the group will meet with President Barack Obama at the White House on Thursday.While some in law enforcement and in the political realm have painted supporters of criminal justice reform as anti-cop, the 130 officials who joined the group acknowledge that arrest, prosecution and incarceration -- the tools typically available to police -- can often do more harm than good.“It’s a clear indication that law enforcement is behind reform efforts. A lot of people have said criminal justice reform is soft on crime. This is absolute proof that’s not the case,” said former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, who attended the launch event. Kerik, a law-and-order Republican who had been nominated for a top position in the Bush administration, has been a criminal justice reform advocate since he got out of federal prison for corruption charges and tax fraud.“This is really cover for those political leaders. This tells them this is OK to do. In the political world, nobody wants to be labeled ‘soft on crime.’ All they have to do is walk in this room and they realize they can do what they want to do, what they need to do, what should be done, and it’s not soft on crime,” Kerik said.Kerik said there’s been a big shift in criminal justice reform over the past few decades, pointing to the presence of Ed Meese -- who served as attorney general of the United States under President Ronald Reagan -- as an indication of the pendulum swing.Meese said that there were “a lot of very good ideas” presented by the organization, but rejected the suggestion that his views or the views of the public had shifted dramatically since his time in office. “The shift has not been in the objective, which is to reduce crime,” Meese said. “What we’re talking about today is not that you would not continue what has been good policing in the past, but at the other end … once a person is convicted of a crime, how do you handle that person?”Meese said he had “not been an advocate of mandatory minimums” in general, because he believed “judges have to have a certain amount of discretion.” But he said mandatory minimums came about because judges were being “too lenient” in the past.“We’re looking at now not leniency, but better handling of people,” Meese said. “They’re not being soft on crime because nobody is getting away with crime, and the whole purpose is to be more effective in our treatment of crime. Certainly that’s not being soft on crime.”Police departments don’t have much control over the variables that contribute to crime, Charles McClelland, chief of the Houston Police Department, added. The cycle of incarceration starts during someone’s younger years and, by the time they hit their 20s, these people are convicted felons without education, job skills or opportunities to work, he said. “It’s a complex equation but it’s really simple … when you think about it,” he said. “If folks, especially young people, have no legitimate ways to support themselves, they’re going to find illegitimate ways.”“Look at the business formula for urban neighborhoods in big cities. What do you find? Liquor stores, pharmacies, pawn shops [and] quick [check-cashing] businesses. That’s it,” he continued. “So with that formula it is a recipe for failure.”It falls on law enforcement, McClelland said, to advocate for better policies that don’t criminalize entire groups of people and that encourage businesses to support those who want to turn their lives around, which is “an effective crime-reduction strategy.” “We have to use our bully pulpits as police chiefs to bring all of those other institutions together,” he said. “Because law enforcement didn’t invent this situation that we’re in and we can’t solve it by ourselves.” The law enforcement leaders involved in the group believe there are too many people behind bars who don’t belong there and that officers and prosecutors “often come in contact with individuals who would be better served with responses outside the criminal justice system.”Officers often lack anything “beyond arrest and prosecution” to respond to the situations they face, the group said. “Many of these individuals need treatment, not arrest and jail time. The criminal justice system cannot serve as a treatment plan, and in many cases, exacerbates illnesses and addictions,” its principles statement said.The organization wants Congress and state legislatures to reclassify nonviolent felonies as misdemeanors and “eliminate petty or duplicative offenses from criminal codes, where appropriate.” They said mandatory minimums and three-strikes policies “are typically overly punitive.”Members of the organization said that these conversations about the need for reform were taking place long before the unrest in Ferguson and the prominence of the Black Lives Matter movement. The group, which formally launched Wednesday, formed within the past year and has had organizational support from the Brennan Center.The law enforcement leaders are speaking out at a convenient time, as the American public and both sides of the political aisle are increasingly supportive of changes to the criminal justice system and the need for police reform. David Menschel, a civil rights attorney, said that the organization included some of the ""VERY WORST enforcers of mass incarceration."" While some ""genuine reformers"" are involved, Menschel said that the group includes some of the ""most stalwart pro-carceral types who cynically want cover."""

5,POLITICS,"Jim Webb's Campaign Ends, Leaving More Questions Than Answers",Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-webb-campaign_us_5627eed2e4b08589ef4a9386,"For example: What was the Jim Webb campaign, anyway?",2015-10-21,"Did you know that the Jim Webb campaign had a campaign logo and a motto? That's it, right there!",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5627ef921400002a00c7a820.jpeg?cache=rJ5QgFt0N7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week, Jim Webb announced that he's dropping out of the Democratic presidential primary.But wait, wait. I'm getting ahead of myself: Jim Webb is a former Democratic senator from Virginia, and while he's been running for the Democratic presidential nomination since last November, you may not have been aware of that until last week's Democratic debate, when you tuned in and noticed there were all these other dudes onstage with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Jim Webb was one of those other dudes, the one complaining about not getting enough time to speak.Okay, so, like I said, Jim Webb, a guy who was running in the Democratic primary, is no longer running in the Democratic primary. All that's over now. But while we can call this a definitive ending to his bid for his party's presidential nomination, we can't really call it a satisfying end to this story. After all, there are so many questions that Webb has left unanswered!Webb's brief campaign is a lot like the final season of ""Lost"" in that regard. There are just so many mysteries -- from critical plot holes to intriguing loose ends -- that haven't been adequately explained. You know, like: ""Was Walt magical? And did he use this magic to summon the polar bear to Lost Island?"" I was disappointed when the ""Lost"" showrunners opted to leave these matters unresolved, and I find myself feeling similarly out-of-sorts now that Webb has quit the scene without providing closure on a number of points.So, as inconsequential as the Webb campaign might have been to some, the end of it has left my psyche feeling all a-jangle. That's why I'm publishing my remaining questions for Jim Webb (or his surrogates), in the hopes that he (or they) might answer them and allow me to move on with my life as well.1. Hey, so, between the time that you got into the race and the night of the first Democratic debate, what were you, like, doing?I hate to come off so tedious right out of the gate, Mr. Webb, but while it may have seemed to you that you were working hard at being a presidential candidate, most of us didn't really notice you... how to put it? Oh, doing stuff! We didn't notice you doing stuff. And look, there's a lot of space to do stuff, and we tend to notice even the stupid stuff this early in the campaign. Some guy in New Hampshire accidentally tapped bumpers with Hillary Clinton's ""Scooby van"" and Politico wrote a whole story about it. They even asked the guy in question who he was, and for whom he was going to vote.What I'm saying is that if you'd done even a little bit of campaigning, people would have noticed it. Instead, people noticed that they hadn't heard from you in a while. I think it's fair to say that a lot of political observers weren't sure you'd even show up for the debate, because a lot of us just figured that you'd forgotten you were running.2. Who was Craig Crawford?Just wondering, because a lot of reporters had the impression that Crawford was the guy we were supposed to call when we needed answers about the campaign. But I'm on what's apparently a long list of people who never heard back from him. Just yesterday one of my colleagues was wondering how to get in touch with Craig Crawford, and I thought to myself, ""Well, I have an email for him, but what's the point?"" To this day, I don't know what Craig Crawford is. An imaginary friend? A blow-up doll? One of those balls from ""The Last Man On Earth?"" It's a mystery -- one that you, Jim Webb, might have unwound for everyone at the outset by just insisting that he get back to reporters.You should know that at the time I tried to contact him, I was really, really hoping to talk to anyone with anything positive to say about ""Webb 2016."" Maybe this is why there weren't a lot of positive things written about your campaign? Just something to think about.3. With the Democratic party growing more and more comfortable with economic populism, why did you suddenly become averse to it?This is something that really did confuse some of your disaffected former allies. Having been on the Democratic party vanguard on economic populism -- you sowed those seeds long before Elizabeth Warren became a household name, man! -- you seemed a natural foil to the Clinton family's faith in Wall Street elites. Someone who might maybe brick up the revolving door between Citibank and the White House team of economic advisers. But for some reason, you suddenly got all shirty about the Democratic Party abandoning you on this issue. As I reported in July, it left some people mystified:""One of the first things he said to me when I met him,"" says [Virginia Democratic Party activist Lowell] Feld, ""was when I asked him why he had become a Democrat, he told me that the GOP had gone off the deep end, and that the Democrats were the only party with a set of viable economic policies. Now he's saying that the Democrats have gone too far to the left. In what way? This economic populism -- this is stuff you've been talking about.""So... did you forget about that, or did you just not mean it?4. ""Hey, correct me if I'm wrong here, but to run for president as a Democrat, you have to first win a Democratic nomination, right?""That's just another curious question I got from Feld, which I'm reprinting here because it's still not really clear if you ever understood that winning a Democratic nomination involves meeting with actual Democrats from Iowa and New Hampshire and persuading them to support you in numbers great enough to facilitate your campaign winning a majority of Democratic delegates.You seemed to think that in order to win the Democratic nomination, you had to say things that alienate Democratic voters in large numbers. That is not how this works. Do you understand that? I can give you more help if you need it.5. Did you have a staff in any of the early primary states?I think you did, only because The Des Moines Register reported in May that the ""Democratic strategist who was running the Iowa effort for presidential hopeful Jim Webb"" had resigned from your campaign.See, when the person running your ""Iowa effort"" quit, that tipped me off to the possibility that you might have some sort of ""Iowa effort.""But said Iowa effort must not have expended a whole lot of ergs, because it took The Des Moines Register a week to notice that there was no one running it anymore. Not that I blame them.6. Was Walt magical? And did he use this magic to summon the polar bear to the island?I'm just asking on the off chance that this is what you spent your ""campaign"" trying to figure out. Also, how did the frozen wheel thing work, exactly?7. Having not really mounted any sort of campaign, or built any sort of infrastructure, or hired a communications director who would communicate directly with people, what makes you think you'd be a viable independent candidate?See, independent candidacies are very difficult to mount. You have to do things like secure your own ballot access, and you won't have a national party and its small army of people-who-can-do-the-tedious-stuff-for-you standing behind your candidacy. Basically, an independent candidacy would combine all the work that you evidently couldn't be bothered to do during your brief campaign as a Democrat with all the work that you probably didn't realize gets done by other Democrats. In an independent candidacy, you would be largely responsible for overseeing the completion of all this work.Does this sound like something for which you've got the drive? Because it would really surprise me to hear you say yes, after the minimalist approach you took to your first presidential campaign.Also, you're not going to win this election, so the work, in and of itself, is going to have to be the thing that really fulfills you.8. This week, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) agreed in principle to run for speaker of the House, on the conditions that he get blanket support from everyone in his party, not be forced to do any of the busywork traditionally associated with the office and be allowed ample time off to spend with his family.Was this sort of what you were going for?~~~~~Jason Linkins edits ""Eat The Press"" for The Huffington Post, and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast, ""So That Happened.""

Last December, Dallas traded for the veteran point guard, hoping he would help spark an offense that needed an infusion of quickness and tempo. Not only did the trade not work, but Rondo was essentially exiled from the team after his pitiful playoff performance against Houston.The Kings are an interesting landing destination for the four-time All-Star in that he will receive plenty of minutes and the opportunity to run pick-and-roll with another Kentucky product, DeMarcus Cousins. Rondo's best basketball came in Boston when he played alongside Kevin Garnett, with whom he could play the two-man game anywhere on the floor. Cousins is one of the NBA's brightest young bigs, and newly minted head coach George Karl will surely want to maximize the connection. Rondo's career depends on it.Metta World Peace, LA LakersLet's be clear: The artist formerly known as Ron Artest is 35 years old. Furthermore, the Lakers, who possess an elite collection of young talent but also zero depth to speak of and an aging Kobe Bryant, will be lucky to win 35 games. But that hardly detracts from World Peace's return to the gold and purple. After a miserable 29-game stretch with the Knicks two years ago in which he averaged 4.8 points on sub-40 percent shooting, MWP spent time playing in both China and Italy. We're not really sure how much he can contribute -- but then again, the Lakers enter this season with few expectations after the worst season in the organization's decorated history. By February, when they've been back 20 games, MWP may be one of the few reasons to watch this team. Monta Ellis, Indiana PacersEllis opted out of his contract with Dallas despite having arguably the best two-year stretch of his 11-year career. Indiana, meanwhile, inked the scoring dynamo to a four-year, $44 million deal. At his core, Ellis is a volume scorer with the green light to hoist whenever he deems fit. With the Mavs, the presence of head coach Rick Carlisle and Dirk Nowitzki helped Ellis become a more efficient scorer and better all-around player. But can the same be said about Frank Vogel and Paul George with the Pacers? Or will Ellis revert back to his Golden State days, when he routinely took 20-plus shots a night? Gerald Green/Amar'e Stoudemire, Miami HeatGreen is a high-flying dunker who also thinks he's the second coming of Ray Allen from the perimeter. He literally cannot help but hoist 3-pointers, though he converts under 37 percent for his career. In theory, Green will aid Dwyane Wade in terms of carrying the scoring load so much from the 2-spot. In reality, Green will drive head coach Erik Spoelstra up the wall with his defensive lapses and inconsistent play on both ends. Stoudemire is the oldest 32-year-old in the league, and yet, he remains one of the game's premier mid-range jump shooters from the power forward spot.Miami wants to be relevant in the East, and with Goran Dragic running the show flanked by an excellent front court in Chris Bosh and Hassan Whiteside, the Heat can win upwards of 50 games. But either Green or Stoudemire will have to exceed expectations in order for it to happen.Jeremy Lin, Charlotte HornetsTwo years, $4 million: that is the state of Jeremy Lin. Charlotte needed a point guard on the cheap, and Lin -- constantly under a microscope -- proved to be a serviceable one in both LA and Houston the past three years. The most intriguing element to this is what Hornets owner Michael Jordan said during the team's recent trip to China. ""I think [he] is going to be our biggest acquisition,"" Jordan said. ""His penetration, his shooting capability, his point guard savvy."" Remember, these comments come on the heels of Jordan drafting Wisconsin's superstar center Frank Kaminsky in the lottery.Paul Pierce/Josh Smith, LA ClippersDon't call these legacy deals. Pierce was huge down the stretch for Washington during the playoffs and Smith had a series of strong moments with Houston. Neither is the star of old, but then again, the Clippers don't need stars. Pierce, who returns home, won't be asked to play more than 20 minutes. He can validate the signing by providing his patented, timely late buckets, especially in May and June. Smith's value will be as a versatile defender and two-way rebounder to spell Blake Griffin. Maybe he doesn't play a key role in the postseason, but if he can provide an added dose of energy in the regular season, perhaps it means Griffin's heavy minutes (35.5 career) decrease. David West, San Antonio SpursLaMarcus Aldridge was San Antonio's marquee signing, but don't forget about West. A natural pick-and-pop four man who has always killed the glass, the 35-year-old will embrace his role playing 20 minutes a night. Moreover, he will alleviate the pressure for both Aldridge and Tim Duncan because he can play the five as well, and his no-frills attitude is a welcomed sign for Gregg Popovich and a franchise that rarely dips into the free agency pool.Louis Williams, LA LakersLou Williams is essentially a 6-foot-1 version of Nick Young. A microwave of a scorer who does nothing else, Williams comes off winning the league's Sixth Man of the Year award in Toronto. In fact, Williams, by averaging two assists per game, doubled Young's output. Neither one shoots it at a high clip, and neither has ever been able to effectively play off the ball. The real entertainment factor here is whether head coach Byron Scott plays them together -- with Kobe and rookie point guard D'Angelo Russell, who also need the ball. It almost seems unfeasible that Bryant would be able to get through an entire season without losing his mind trying to contain Williams and Young on the same roster. Then again, Scott seems to be all aboard, given his desire for the NBA to implement a four-point line. Williams and Young may have found their match.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.

7,POLITICS,Joe Biden's Too-Long Goodbye,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-long-goodbye_us_561fbd08e4b028dd7ea6d1b9,"If Biden didn't have the heart to run, why did he wait so long to make his decision?",2015-10-21,Vice President Joe Biden officially confirmed Wednesday that he would not run for president in 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561fbeef1400002a00c7a05b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Joe Biden is a man of many minds, often in conflict. But he wasn’t serious about running for president.Most of his inner circle wasn't serious about the idea, either.Biden said in February that he would decide by the end of the summer whether he would run in 2016. At that time, no one thought much of it -- other than that he was a vice president understandably reluctant to fold his cards.After his son Beau’s death in May, Biden emphatically didn’t have the heart to run, and he privately said so to those who had known him longest. And they believed him.They knew what an emotional mess he was after the loss of his son. They knew that he didn’t have it in him to launch what would have been a ferocious contest for the nomination.But even so -- and at the sufferance of a sympathetic political clan -- Biden World staged (or allowed) a farewell tour, which finally came to an end on Wednesday, that risked making a dignified mourner look like a manipulator in search of a last road to glory.That was never really Biden.True, he didn’t and doesn’t like the Clintons. He thinks they stand for a grasping, venal kind of politics he considers beneath him and his Catholic “social mission” view of government.But that alone was never enough to force Biden, at the age of 72, to run for a third time after two disastrous earlier efforts.A week after his son’s funeral, when a friend of 30 years encouraged him to run for president for a third time, he answered, “I don’t have the heart for it. I’m done.”But letting go is hard, and the concentric circles of Biden loyalists and friends weren’t eager -- out of love, self-interest, mere yen for the game -- to tell him to do so, especially as Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers went into free fall.Instead, insiders told the press that he was “seriously” considering a run, and pointed out that he had set a lengthy timetable for deciding.Former Sen. Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), one of Biden’s closest and dearest friends, publicly restated Biden’s “end of summer” formulation a few months ago. “All I did was repeat what Joe had said publicly long before,” Kaufman said last week. “I’ve been amazed at what happened.”He shouldn’t have been. With Clinton stumbling, a restatement of the old, already public news was viewed as, well, news. Behind the scenes, though, Biden World never did much, if anything, to put the machinery in place. Calls to states such as New Hampshire -- a natural early launching pad -- revealed no activity. Friends talked big in South Carolina, but it was talk.Major donors whom Biden would have personally locked in right away never got calls from the veep.Biden advisers eventually got a briefing from Democratic Party officials on their dauntingly complex nominating rules. But by then, it was too late to build the kind of campaign structure the process requires, and that Clinton and others had assembled long ago. Biden’s well-liked chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti, did the due diligence -- which primarily meant telling the world that yes, the vice president’s advisers were looking at the possibilities -- while waiting for Biden to make up his mind.The Long Goodbye devolved into a waiting game in which the key and only question was: What’s he waiting for?And if Biden's heart really was never in it, then why, indeed, was he taking so long?The only possible explanation we can infer was that he was waiting for Clinton’s candidacy to implode.Biden's best buddy, President Barack Obama, praised him on “60 Minutes” recently as a great vice president, but declined to tout him as a unique presidential candidate. Most national politicians want to run for president at some point, Obama rather dismissively observed.Now Biden has bowed out officially, but only after Clinton and Bernie Sanders performed well at their first debate. The departure looks, at least in part, like the result of naked political calculation.Which is not how Biden or his friends wanted him to exit the electoral stage.It was a fond farewell, but it went on just a little too long.Also on HuffPost:"
8,POLITICS,Federal Policy Should Make It Easier For Native Americans To Get Emergency Contraception,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emergency-contraception-native-americans_us_5627d4d1e4b02f6a900f3c44,The drug is supposed to be stocked at pharmacies and available without a prescription.,2015-10-21,"In this Oct. 19, 2012, file photo, Charon Asetoyer, executive director of the Native American Community Board, attends an Albuquerque forum on access for American Indian women getting emergency contraceptive Plan B.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_13_3000_2096%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A long-overdue policy update will ensure that Native American women have better access to emergency contraception at Indian Health Services facilities. In 2013, a federal court ordered the Food and Drug Administration to approve over-the-counter use of Plan B One-Step, the emergency contraceptive, for “all women of reproductive potential.” But numerous investigations had found that IHS facilities have failed to comply with the FDA’s new guidelines.On Friday, the IHS released its written policy to mandate that the program allow patients seeking Plan B to be able to obtain the pill without a prescription, and cease barring teenagers from accessing the pill. The IHS had previously left it up to individual service units to decide how to dispense the pill, leading to the patchwork of policies across Native American and Alaska Native communities.“The policy must now be rigorously enforced so that every woman who relies on IHS for her health care can walk into an IHS pharmacy and obtain the services she needs and to which she is legally entitled,” ACLU Legislative Counsel Georgeanne Usova said in a statement following the publication of the policy update.The Native American Women’s Health Education Resource Center released a survey demonstrating that most of the IHS facilities were imposing age restrictions on Plan B, contradicting the FDA’s product labeling for the drug. And a group of Democratic U.S. Senators, led by Barbara Boxer (Calif.), had urged the Department of Health and Human Services in March to improve access to Plan B at IHS facilities after a survey conducted by Boxer’s staff found that some IHS locations did not offer emergency contraception at all. (The DHHS administers the IHS).“We have been fighting for this for over five years,” Charon Asetoyer, the director of the Native American Women’s Health Education Resource Center, told Indian Country Today. Plan B is most effective when taken within 72 hours of contraceptive failure or unprotected sex. It contains a high dose of levonorgestrel, the same hormone used in many birth control pills.The drug is more effective the sooner it’s taken, but Native Americans living on reservations may find themselves traveling long distances to find a private pharmacy that stocks the drug, which can cost anywhere from $30 to $60. IHS facilities are supposed to provide the drug at no cost. Timely access to Plan B is crucial for those hoping to prevent an unintended pregnancy, like rape survivors. Native Americans in particular face higher rates of sexual assault than the rest of the population: One out of three Native American women will be raped during her lifetime, according to the ACLU.There are already other barriers to accessing emergency contraception for Native Americans. Twenty-seven percent of all self-identified Native Americans and Alaska Natives live in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and some of the poorest counties in the U.S. encompass Sioux reservations in North and South Dakota."

Franchise restaurants that fail to comply will face increased penalties from Subway.Prompted by an Australian teen who, in 2013, uploaded to Facebook a picture of his Subway Footlong measuring only 11 inches, some people in the U.S. measured their own sandwiches and came up short. Several individuals soon filed suit, and a federal court consolidated the cases into a single class-action, according to court documents.Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the chain would enact changes to ensure sandwich length and could pay up to $1,000 to each plaintiff and up to $525,000 in plaintiffs' legal fees.The parties agreed to some settlement terms eighteen months ago, but attorneys subsequently argued over legal fees and payments for several months. A judge gave preliminary approval on Oct. 2, with a hearing for final approval set for January, Nation's Restaurant News reports.A rep from Subway did not return a phone call or email.Read the settlement proposal below."

McGinn had told the university in fall 2012 that the messages he sent Morrison -- complimenting her legs, discussing his erections, floating the idea of having sex with her and asking to kiss her -- were not a problem because they were in a relationship, though Morrison said otherwise. The university charged him with failing to report a consensual relationship and he resigned in 2013.Last week, Morrison filed a federal lawsuit against the university over its handling of the case, partly because it failed to charge McGinn with sexual harassment. She also sued McGinn for sexual harassment and civil assault.The suit came just days after the University of California, Berkeley defended its own handling of harassment allegations against astronomy professor Geoffrey Marcy. Like The University of Miami, UC Berkeley said it crafted an agreement that led to a quick resolution and the resignation of a tenured faculty member.Both schools made similar points: It's difficult to simply fire a tenured professor, even if there's strong evidence of their guilt.

""It's the culture of employment management bumping up against the Title IX realm,"" said Peter Lake, director of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University. Lake believes increased scrutiny over how schools handle campus rape has led advocates to demand more public condemnation of sexual harassment offenders.""I could see where you might see it as a great victory to eliminate the problem from campus,"" Lake said.

Morrison then filed an anonymous complaint in March 2014 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, saying the University of Miami mishandled the case and failed to protect her from retaliation. She allowed her name to go on record once she filed the lawsuit based on her EEOC claims.When news of McGinn’s resignation became public -- along with suggestion he was forced out -- philosophy professors from other top universities defended him, and some still think he was treated unjustly. Esa Saarinen, a philosophy professor at Aalto University in Finland, wrote a letter in 2013 saying he was astonished over the ""utterly unfair treatment"" of McGinn based on ""false allegations.""

12,RELIGION,The World's First Permanent Death Cafe Could Soon Come To London,Jaweed Kaleem,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/death-cafe-london_us_5627c6fee4b02f6a900f109c,“Talking about death is a healthy and productive activity.”,2015-10-21,"A logo and slogan from the Columbus, Ohio Death Cafe, which Lizzy Miles organizers. The cafe began in July 2012 and was the first of its kind in the U.S.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5627c9cb12000026007e5a95.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every month, dozens of death cafes take place around the world.The pop-up events, which happen in American cities in nearly every state and in nations across six continents, are part of a volunteer-led, grassroots movement to get people from all walks of life to talk candidly about their views and experiences regarding dying.The cafes are hosted in coffee shops, living rooms and community centers, and are organized by hospice workers, funeral directors and clergy, among others. They’re casual but direct, and participants usually spend an hour or two at each cafe as they open up over tea, coffee, cookies and cake. The topics range widely -- from the fear of dying and terminal disease to the logistics of funerals and views on an afterlife -- but all touch upon mortality. Since the idea began in London in 2011, there have been more than 2,400 Death Cafes.Now, a group of entrepreneurs wants to launch the first permanent Death Cafe in central London. The functioning public cafe, which would have food, drinks and daily events on death, has raised more than 18,000 pounds in just two days via a crowdfunding campaign. The goal is to reach 250,000 pounds by Dec. 19.“It is set up to be a community benefit society, so the crowdfunding is actually selling ownership shares in the cafe. It will be nonprofit and all shareholders will have equal voting rights, regardless of number of shares owned,” said Lizzy Miles, an Ohio-based hospice volunteer and Death Cafe organizer who is on the board of the new London venture. “Talking about death is a healthy and productive activity.”Organizers have set up detailed business plans on their website, and are aiming for a two-room space with a full kitchen to be used as a cafe as well as an event space for music and poetry. They’ve also teamed with the U.K.’s National Council for Palliative Care and the Dying Matters Coalition, a 30,000-member group that hosts Britain’s annual Dying Matters Awareness Week each May.In a recent survey, the coalition found that 8 in 10 British people think the country’s residents are uncomfortable talking about death. The survey found that just 1 in 3 has a will, and only 21 percent have talked about end-of-life wishes with another person, be it a doctor or loved one. Surveys in the U.S. have found similar results.""I am proud to be the first investor in Death Cafe London. I wish the project much success and that it fills its potential to benefit many people by positively changing culture around death and dying,” said Jon Underwood, one of the cafe’s main organizers. He launched the first pop-up Death Cafe in London four years ago.Underwood modeled the idea after the “cafés mortels” that sociologist Bernard Crettaz started hosting in Switzerland in 2004. Crettaz, who has incorporated death into his research, helped spread the events to Belgium and France. Today, Death Cafes are found in countries as diverse as Senegal, China and Greece.“The growth of the death cafe movement seems to indicate there is a population out there that stands with me, yet every day I still come across people who say talking about death is morbid.

13,POLITICS,Biden's Biggest Booster Bemoans Bow-Out,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-president-2016-dick-harpootlian_us_5627edffe4b02f6a900f6e39,“He would have Kicked. Her. Ass. Write that down.”,2015-10-21,"Joe Biden addresses the South Carolina Democratic Party as former Democratic Chairman, Dick Harpootlian, left, looks on.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5627efe11400002200c7a823.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Among those who encouraged Vice President Joe Biden to run for president, none were as ubiquitous and aggressive as Dick Harpootlian.The former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party was quick with a quote, alternating between praising the VP’s down-home charm and giving an acid-tongued take on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's chances. He cut a $10,000 check to a pro-Biden Super PAC and predicted cataclysmic doom over Clinton’s email controversy. Reporters wrote entire articles about his Biden-whispering.So in the moments after Biden formally announced that he would not run for president, it was hardly surprising to find Harpootlian in a somber mood. He was, he acknowledged, “disappointed,” and not just because Biden is “the single most honorable man I’ve met in politics ever.” He genuinely thought Biden could win.“He would have kicked her ass,” Harpootlian said, in reference to Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner. “He would have Kicked. Her. Ass. Write that down.”And so we did.There isn’t much data to suggest that Harpootlian is right. Biden did poorly in national match-ups, and found himself trailing Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in some of the early voting states. But Harpootlian argues that on the ground in South Carolina, things were trending the VP’s way.“Joe Riley was ready to endorse and called him telling him to enter,” Harpootlian said. Reached for comment, a spokeswoman for Riley, the longtime mayor of Charleston, said that he was not on the cusp of asking Biden to run, though she didn't specify what their private talks entailed.“I don’t know if he could have competed in Iowa at this late date,"" Harpootlian added. ""But South Carolina wouldn’t have been his firewall, it would have been his launching pad.”In spite of his disappointment, Harpootlian said Biden’s decision to bow out didn’t come as a complete surprise. He thought the vice president was planning to run as recently as late last week, but he said things changed over the weekend. Biden had been making calls into South Carolina and then, abruptly, those stopped. “And then everything went radio quiet yesterday,” Harpootlian said.“When you lose the apple of your eye, your son, who you think will be president someday, you have good days and bad days,” Harpootlian said. “At the end of the day, he was having good days and bad days. Some days he got up ready to run and some days he wasn’t.”With Biden now out of the race, Harpootlian is grappling with the likelihood that Clinton will end up winning not just his home state, but also his party’s nomination. She is a “deeply flawed candidate,” he said, who will have trouble winning the general election. If he were managing her campaign, he’d “strip away all these freaking people she surrounds herself with” and tell her to go “off the script.”“She is much more comfortable rubbing elbows at the Aspen Institute than she is in speaking to real people with real problems. There is a sense of noblesse oblige in her approach to real people,” he argued, suggesting it is the byproduct of having been at the top echelons of state and national power for three decades. “There has always been someone standing next to her bed in the morning with a cup of coffee on a silver platter.”And yet, despite his feelings toward Clinton, Harpootlian is now rooting for her to win (though he thinks it won’t be easy unless Donald Trump gets the GOP nomination). He doesn’t want another candidate to enter the Democratic primary to fill the void that Biden left. And he isn’t feeling the Bernie Sanders vibe.“I’m not quite ready to refer to myself as Comrade Harpootlian,” he says. “I just don’t think the country is ready for a socialist yet. [But] If Republicans take the White House, maybe after eight years of that we will have riots in the street.”Also on HuffPost:"

Forbes/St. Louis Post-Dispatch",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5627e6fd12000026007e5ad7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Six fires set at predominantly African-American churches in and around St. Louis are linked, according to authorities investigating the alleged arsons. Though authorities say the spate of blazes that began on Oct. 8 are connected, they are unsure if racial or religious bias motivated the perpetrators. ""Churches are a place of worship and a place for sanctuary. Why someone would set fire to a place like that is beyond comprehension,"" St. Louis Mayor Frances Slay said in a statement. ""Someone knows who is responsible, and our partners have put together a sizable reward to entice information.""No suspects have been identified, and none of the churches were occupied at the time of the fires.The first suspicious fire burned Bethel Nondenominational Church in Jennings, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb. The second fire, on Oct. 10, was also in Jennings. The four fires after that struck places of worship in St. Louis. Baptist, Catholic and Lutheran congregations were among those targeted. In at least five of the cases, the fires were set near the front door of the church, according to KMOV-TV.At St. Augustine Catholic Church, a fire set around 4 p.m. on Oct. 14 damaged the two large wooden doors at the entrance.“Luckily it was caught pretty quick,” said Gabe Jones, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of St. Louis. “The damage was pretty limited.” The church must cover a $2,500 insurance deductible to replace the doors, he said.Before the attacks around St. Louis, authorities classified five other church fires at African-American churches this year as arsons, according to a count by The Huffington Post.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the St. Louis Metropolitan Police and the St. Louis Fire Department are investigating the fires in St. Louis. Investigators believe that the suspect or suspects might be committing the fires because of stress, according to a statement released Wednesday by authorities.The reward for info is now up to $9,000 from combination of sources, the bureau told HuffPost."

The minimum wage in New York state is currently set at $8.75, but Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is pushing for a statewide minimum wage of $15 an hour, a number that he had initially said was too high. In July, New York raised the minimum wage for fast food workers to $15 an hour statewide in a measure that will be phased in by 2018 in New York City and 2021 in the rest of the state.According to Census data released last year, Syracuse was the 23rd poorest city in the country with 34.6 percent of the population living in poverty between 2009 and 2013.Miner told the New York Times that the increase would help boost her city's economy.“This is an investment in the people who work here that will inure to the benefit of their families and the local economy,” she told the Times. “I do know that it will benefit those families. They may have pizza on a Friday night where they didn’t before, or they may buy an extra pair of shoes for their kids to wear to school.”Last year, Cuomo opposed allowing local municipalities to set their own individual minimum wages because he said that it would cause different places to compete against one another. After initially proposing to raise the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour in New York City and $10.50 an hour in the rest of the state in January, Cuomo announced that he would support a $15 statewide minimum wage last month.Also on HuffPost:"

Earlier this month, the union backed off an initial plan to endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton amid reports that Biden, who has strong labor ties, was thinking of jumping into the race. “When our union decided that we would endorse Joe Biden for President if he entered the race, we did so knowing he was going through a very deliberate process of checking the boxes to determine whether he would be able to run the kind of campaign it takes to win in terms of infrastructure, money and constituencies, and while he made that final gut decision on whether to run,"" Schaitberger added. According to The New York Times, Schaitberger worried that endorsing Clinton may upset some of IAFF's membership, which leans Republican. The union, however, traditionally endorses Democrats because of their pro-labor positions. Although Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also has a long history of supporting labor rights, Clinton has so far accumulated far more union endorsements, including from the American Federation of Teachers, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. Sanders scored the backing of the National Nurses United in August. The Clinton campaign declined to comment. "
18,POLITICS,Mississippi City Sued Over 'Jailhouse Shakedown' That Hurts Poor,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/biloxi-mississippi-lawsuit-poor_us_562799c8e4b0bce347032090,Those who couldn’t afford fines were held for days in what one woman called “filthy and nasty” cells.,2015-10-21,"The ACLU has filed a lawsuit against the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, on behalf of Joseph Anderson, left, and his girlfriend Qumotria Kennedy, right. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56279ab212000026007e59f8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- It was two days after Christmas in 2012 when the police in Biloxi, Mississippi, showed up at Joseph Anderson’s door. It had been a hard couple of years for the 52-year-old, who had three heart attacks and a stroke in a single week in 2011.Anderson, who has trouble walking, and was living on Social Security and food stamps was jailed for seven days before he got in front of a judge -- and rang in the new year behind bars.His crime? Owing the City of Biloxi $170.Anderson's girlfriend, Qumotra Kennedy, found herself in a similar situation earlier this year. Her trip to jail came in July after a police officer pulled over her friend for allegedly running a stop sign. Kennedy had buried her father a few weeks earlier. She spent five nights in what she described as a “filthy and nasty"" jail before she got to see a judge. Kennedy said even though the cell was cold she was only given one sheet, and that it smelled of urine.The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against Biloxi on behalf of Kennedy, Anderson and another man, alleging that the city's municipal court structure is unconstitutional and has “instilled fear and panic amongst the poorest residents of the City and the surrounding region."" The ACLU believes there are many others who have been unfairly jailed by the city of Biloxi, and lawyers are seeking to make the federal civil rights lawsuit a class action.""Indigent people who owe money to Biloxi, including people who are homeless or disabled, feel pressured to divert funds for basic necessities— food, medication, utilities, and transportation—to avoid jail and the devastating impact of incarceration on their families, loved ones, jobs, and housing,"" the lawsuit states.These type of policies have drawn significant attention in recent months. After the death of Michael Brown, the municipal court system in Ferguson, Missouri, and the surrounding St. Louis County came under close scrutiny, resulting in significant reforms. Civil rights attorneys have also filed lawsuits against cities with so-called ""pre-set bail"" policies, which mandate monetary amounts that people must pay to be released from jail no matter their individual circumstances.""It's essentially a jailhouse shakedown. Cities across the country, like Biloxi, are scrambling to generate revenue, and they're doing it off the backs of poor people,"" Nusrat Choudhury, an attorney with the ACLU's Racial Justice Program, said in a statement. ""Being poor is not a crime. Yet across America, people are being locked up because they can't afford to pay traffic fines and fees. This lawsuit seeks to dismantle a two-tiered system of justice that punishes the poorest, particularly people of color, more harshly than those with means in flagrant violation of the Constitution.""Biloxi is a struggling city. The percentage of individuals living below the federal poverty level ""more than doubled"" from 13.3 percent in 2009 to 27.5 percent in 2013, according to the lawsuit. But at the same time, the portion of the city's budget that came from fines and forfeits went up by 26 percent from fiscal year 2008-2009 to 2015-2016. To collect on that revenue, Biloxi relied on the services of a for-profit company that charged poor people $40 per month to collect their debt. Employees of the company, the lawsuit alleged, ""routinely threatened poor probationers with arrest and jail when they reported for probation 'supervision' without money to pay toward their debt or with less than the amount of money required to meet the payment schedule set by the Biloxi Municipal Court.""That's what Kennedy said happened to her. Already struggling to provide for her family, Kennedy's arrest was a major setback. When she was finally released from jail, she found out from her boss that he had laid her off from her part-time job.“He told me that he’s sorry, he had to let me go because I missed too many days,” Kennedy said. She said she doesn't understand why the city wouldn't let her do community service, and said there are a lot of people in her shoes.“My work is not steady, and it’s hard to find a job right now, the way the economy is out here,” Kennedy said. “I can’t pay something I ain’t got.”Read the lawsuit filing in full below:"

It's ironic, considering how often he skips out on Senate votes.<span><br></span>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562693411400002a00c7a63c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- After being widely criticized for his absenteeism in the Senate, where he has missed more votes than any other legislator, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) argued that government officials should be fired for not doing their jobs.In a rare appearance on the Senate floor Tuesday, where his first vote in nearly a month was to end sanctuary cities, the presidential hopeful advocated for a proposed bill that would institute more accountability in the scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs.""If you work at the VA, and you aren't doing your job, they get to fire you,"" Rubio said of the proposed bill. ""I think people are shocked that that doesn't actually exist in the entire government, since there's really no other job in the country where if you don't do your job, you don't get fired.""But in this instance, we're just limiting it to one agency. This should actually be the rule in the entire government, where if you're not doing your job, you should be fired,"" he added.Tim Miller, the communications director for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of Rubio's rivals in the race for the White House, cheekily tweeted Tuesday that he agreed with the senator.The Florida Republican defended his lax voting record earlier this month by claiming that voting isn't the most important aspect of an elected representative's job, but rather it's focusing on constituent work and committee service. But Rubio has been frequently absent from hearings held by the Senate Foreign Relations full committee and subcommittee on which he serves.Rubio isn't the only member of the Senate with truancy issues who is running for president. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have had similar problems. On the other side of the aisle, former Sen. Barack Obama also had trouble showing up to votes while on the campaign trail.Democrats quickly attacked Rubio for his comments, and for the fact that after skipping so many votes, he chose to be present for a bill to penalize certain undocumented immigrants. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra of California called him ""no show Rubio"" in a call with reporters hosted by the Democratic National Committee.""You miss a third of all of the votes you're supposed to cast in the Senate, and you show up for this political one,"" he said. ""People have to question what drives you and why are you doing this, especially when you flip-flopped from your positions in the past on immigration. Being AWOL a third of the time for your work ... should get you fired. But flip-flopping means you're not even doing your job right."" Elise Foley contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost:"
