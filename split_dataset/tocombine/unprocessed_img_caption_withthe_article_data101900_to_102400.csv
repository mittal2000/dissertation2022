Although the Taliban said the attack was to avenge military operations that in recent months have left hundreds of militants dead in northwest Pakistan, the targeting of schoolchildren drew immediate comparisons to the 2012 attack on children's rights activist Malala Yousafzai. Just a week earlier, Yousufzai delivered an impassioned plea for ending the assault on education in Pakistan while accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway.""Let us become the first generation that decides to be the last that sees empty classrooms, lost childhoods and wasted potentials,"" the teenager, who was shot in the head by the Taliban after campaigning for girls' education, said in her acceptance speech.Yousafzai's words are not only a call for action but also emblematic of how to help in the wake of the Army Public School massacre. In a country where most of the population cannot afford to send their children to school, donations toward education go a long way.Here is a list of organizations dedicated to helping children in Pakistan receive an education:The Malala Fund After surviving an attempt on her own life by the Taliban, Yousufzai created a foundation focused on empowering girls through education.CARE Foundation Seeking to end illiteracy in Pakistan, CARE allows donors to sponsor the education of a child, a college student, or an entire class or school.UNESCO The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the U.N.'s leading agency in the area of education, has an office based out of Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, that oversees its ""Education For All"" initiative and also works on eradicating gender inequality. The Citizens Foundation The nonprofit is one of the leading organizations in the field of education in Pakistan, having established 1,000 school units nationwide since its inception in 1995.Global Fund for Women  The Global Fund for Women seeks to advance women's rights through access to education, and finances multiple projects in Pakistan.Oxfam International Working in Pakistan since 1973, Oxfam lists female literacy among its top priorities in the country.DIL Developments in Literacy (DIL) educates and empowers underprivileged students, especially girls, by operating student-centered model schools.

Each night features a special guest culled from the vast treasure trove that is New York City. I was lucky enough to attend the first night of Siberry's six-show residency. First, a word about the Iridium Jazz Club, the former home of venerable guitarist Les Paul who played there from 1996 to 2009. The club continues to honor his memory with Les Paul Mondays, reserved for guest guitarists to play and stand exactly where he stood. In addition, the club books a marvelously eclectic roster of talent throughout the year. Siberry's shows go through Sunday, December 21st. Upcoming shows include the Vernon Reid Power Trio, Dee Dee Bridgewater, and Paquito D'Rivera and Trio Corrente.Siberry was accompanied by musical director Peter Kiesewalter on keyboards, cellist Kevin Fox, actress/singer Rebecca Jenkins and Australian singer Ali Hughes. Imagine, if you will, although you probably can't, so you must go to one of these shows (or all!) - three lovely ladies, festooned with festivus trees and sparkling blingyness, and the voices of sweet and wise-ass angels. Keyboardist Kiesewalter drove the train and cellist Kevin Fox, beautifully underpinned the melodies with his instrument and occasionally a lovely vocal as well.  Photography (c) by Teri Landi, Used With PermissionThe Holiday Hoes and Hosers called to mind one's most magical Christmas dreams from childhood, as well as dreamy David Lynch soundtracks, moon goddess chants, stream of consciousness poetry, kundalini yoga spirits, all celebrating the Prince of Peace. The feathery cello tickled the heart strings - in some cases (mine) drawing tears from the eye. Rufus Wainwright Joins Siberry and her Hoes and Hosers Photography (c) by Teri Landi, Used With PermissionStandout numbers among a night of artisanal delights included ""Hockey,"" ""Are You Burning, Little Candle?"", and, of course, ""Calling All Angels"". Siberry also debuted a wonderful new song from her new album, Consider the Lily, slated for release next year. The highlight of the night was Rufus Wainwright's stunning read of ""O Holy Night,"" which gave chills to my chills. Catherine Russell joins the festivities tonight, Ne-Yo/Ginuwine/Lupe Fiasco collaborator Brandon Howard on Saturday, and others yet to be announced for Friday and Sunday. Sunday's show will be taped for an upcoming PBS broadcast.Summing up, you need to see this - there are still four more chances - get thee to the Iridium and open your heart to the divine.For tickets and information: Iridium Jazz Club."

Normally it doesn't matter much at all. I think this year might be a little different. I think it actually does matter for 2016.,2014-12-18,"The Ohio statehouse Capitol building in Columbus, Ohio.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e1792600002d0183be27.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let's just say it one last time: 2014 was a rough year for Democrats. We had our asses handed to us, and with the exception of a few Democrats winning big races, it's abundantly clear that somewhere along the way we lost our voice. We forgot to tell people why we are Democrats. It's time for us to do a little soul-searching. So as we figure out what happened and get past this moment, as Democrats and Progressives struggle to find our own True North, let's get back to some strategy basics. There is a lot we can do better, which I have been writing about in recent blog posts, but one fairly simple thing we could do might not seem that important, yet it is: We can hold the DNC convention in Ohio in 2016.I don't normally concern myself with where the party holds its nominating convention. Normally it doesn't matter much at all. I think this year might be a little different. I think it actually does matter for 2016.In the interest of full disclosure, I've only been to Columbus a few times in my life (although I have done my share of politics related to the state). Nice city. Nice people. Here's the thing, though: As long as I have been doing presidential politics (30 years now), Ohio has been the number one target state in the country. While you can theoretically win the presidency without winning Ohio, damn few presidents ever have. Obama, both Bushes, Clinton, Reagan, Carter, Nixon -- they all won Ohio in the races they won presidential elections. Kerry and Gore would have won their elections if Ohio had gone their way. It is the ultimate swing state, and it's in the ultimate swing region. Fellow Midwestern states Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa are all important swing states, as is next-door neighbor to the east, Pennsylvania.   The Republicans know this math well. The Republican convention will be in Cleveland in 2016. And John Kasich, Ohio's top Republican, conservative, union-busting governor, has his eye on the White House. Whether Kasich is at the top of the ticket or not, he'll be a formidable campaigner for his party, and he would be at the top of the short list for the VP pick. Meanwhile, the Ohio Legislature and Senate have significant Republican majorities and are currently pushing far-reaching anti-choice legislation that includes a ""Heartbeat"" bill that if passed, would be one of the strictest assaults on women's reproductive freedom in the nation. Additionally, Ohio is one of the few remaining states that still have a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. You really don't get much more conservative than that -- unless you saw Mississippi in the sixties. So we have some serious work to do -- just because Obama won twice doesn't mean we will easily win this time.  Although the state's current political landscape is exceedingly conservative Columbus is the big blue middle, and it's a game changer. A convention in Columbus will matter on so many levels -- it will offer a direct and swift rebuttal to the RNC in Cleveland, fire up the grassroots, and lend extra volume to the collective progressive voice. Columbus is Ohio's largest city, and the 15th largest in the nation, by the way, and it's just the mute button we need to the Republican noise machine that will be grinding away only 120 miles to the north in the summer of 2016.  At a time when we're fighting to revive the very soul of our party, it seems some Midwestern values are just what we need -- less Wall Street, less big money, fewer cozy corporate deals. Let's go to a state with a big and important rural vote. Let's do a convention in a city that is more affordable for working people who are delegates, and where the city really wants us. Let's go to a medium-sized, blue-collar town that has a big African-American presence and a popular African-American mayor, and strong and politically plugged-in LGBT and progressive communities. Let's go where there's an opportunity to harness an otherwise untapped progressive grassroots movement that's been demoralized by recent statewide losses. Let's go to Columbus. After all, we already know we'll win New York (and if we don't, our problems are far greater than we thought!). Pennsylvania will have a Democratic governor, and has been historically easier to win than the Buckeye state. But the battle for the White House will be fought and likely won or lost in Ohio.  It always is."

The elections exemplify the ongoing political struggle in Poland between the ruling Civic Platform party and opposition Law and Justice party, in Warsaw, Poland, Sunday, Nov. 16, 2014. (AP Photo/Alik Keplicz)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc142ac2400003600229cf7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By EMILY CADEI -- OZYIn September, incoming Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz promised to respond to Russian provocations “like a reasonable Polish woman.” Guffaws ensued. Domestic commentators found it an artless attempt to play the gender card; to foreign ears, it just sounded dated and vaguely sexist. But three months later, the mockery has stopped. Poland’s self-styled mother-in-chief has demonstrated what most of us know well: Moms are no pushovers. The 58-year-old pediatrician from small-town central Poland has had to move fast to assert herself in her new role, which opened up when outgoing PM Donald Tusk abruptly left the post after being named European Council president in August. Tusk, a powerful center-right figure who led the Civic Platform party, handpicked Kopacz, a loyal ally who was then speaker of the Sejm, the lower house of parliament. What she stood for was hard to discern — and most Polish observers figured Kopacz would be a placeholder, a factotum who could hold the party together before next fall’s elections.But Kopacz had other ideas. And after a few early stumbles, including that awkward September media appearance, she’s begun to shape her political identity, balancing a practical and, yes, motherly public persona with a deft political touch at home and a firm stance overseas. A setback for her party in local elections last month shows she has plenty of work to do. But the prime minister leaves little doubt that she’s the one in charge. “She definitely adopted a very hands-on approach right from the beginning, which took people by surprise,” says Pawel Swieboda, the president of DemosEuropa, a Warsaw-based think tank.In public, the divorced mother of one looks and acts the part of no-nonsense matriarch: cropped, middle-aged mom haircut, wire-rim glasses, understated makeup, a calm delivery that is the opposite of fiery. “She’s not flamboyant, but she’s tough, you know?” says Judy Dempsey, a Berlin-based fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an expert on Eastern Europe. Her pro-family posture is also a smart rearguard action against the rival party Law and Justice, which trumped Kopacz’s Civic Platform in November. Law and Justice tends to paint the current government as liberal, anti-family and anti-church. “She’s been very clever about saying, ‘Well, I’m a mother and I’ve got children and values,’” Dempsey says.Poles first got a glimpse of that Ewa Kopacz (pronounced EH-va) on Oct. 1, when she delivered her inaugural speech to parliament. In it, Kopacz promised to “act pragmatically” in response to developments in Ukraine — no Tusk-ian saber rattling, though she emphasized firmness. She pledged to push for “energy solidarity” within the EU while defending Poland’s ever-important coal industry (and later that month, fended off deep mandatory emission cuts at a European Union summit on climate change).She also gave a nod to her caregiver background, though without an overt emphasis on gender. “I am a doctor — it’s a profession that may be considered a special mission, a devotion,” Kopacz said. “It calls for involvement, respect and willingness to help all other people.” A few days later, she reiterated the point in an interview with a Polish newspaper: “Taking care of people is the duty of every politician.” Despite the doubts, Kopacz has also put her stamp on Civic Platform, an unwieldy coalition of centrists who all have their own political ambitions. But then, she knows something about handling competing factions from her days as speaker of the Sejm, including by bringing opposition members into the fold. She’s done the same with her own cabinet. The party’s infighting seems to have stopped for now, experts say, and the moves cemented Kopacz’s unchallenged role as party leader going into elections next fall. The party’s second-place finish to Law and Justice for seats in 16 provincial assemblies last month underscores the tough political environment Kopacz is facing — the ruling party has grown more and more unpopular over the last year. But it also demonstrates how much Civic Platform needs her to help reinvent it.The Polish public, for its part, is responding to Kopacz’s personal, down-to-earth appeals — a contrast to Tusk’s more commanding but detached approach. The traditional family unit remains an anchor in this conservative Catholic country, which is watching its economy and society changing fast. Strains like long working hours and a high cost of living are growing. And Kopacz is showing that she feels their pain. A late October poll by the Warsaw-based Centre for Public Opinion Research pegged Kopacz’s approval rating at 44 percent, to 29 percent disapproval.Still, a quarter of those polled had no opinion — a sign Poles are still getting to know their new prime minister. And to win them over, Kopacz will need to show what family-friendly really means. That could require difficult steps to ease the high unemployment rate. Yet if Kopacz has demonstrated anything so far, it’s that a reasonable Polish woman should not be underestimated. "
5,HEALTHY LIVING,Pizza Hut's Pizza Is Saltier In America Than Anywhere Else In The World,Kate Bratskeir,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pizza-hut-salt-in-us-scary_n_6350258.html,,2014-12-18,"A pepperoni pizza from a Pizza Hut restaurant, a unit of Yum! Brands Inc., is arranged for a photograph in Torrance, California, U.S., on Monday, Oct. 7, 2013. Yum! Brands Inc. is scheduled to release earnings data on Oct. 8. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e7621240000320053ffad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"America, we've got a salt problem.This year, the CDC reported that nine out of 10 kids in the U.S. consume too much salt. This is not because children are latched on to the salt shaker, but rather the foods they most commonly eat (like pizza, burgers, meats and cheeses) are already laden with the stuff. American adults have not grown out of the habit. The FDA recommends the average American consumes no more than 2,300 mg of salt per day, but the average American ingests about 1,000 mg over budget. It seems limiting our salt consumption may be easier said than done. A recent international survey released by World Action on Salt & Health found that Pizza Hut pizzas in the U.S. contain about 70 percent more salt than the same pizzas in Canada and New Zealand. Because the chain sells different menu items internationally, the survey examined five pizzas that have the most global continuity. Served stateside, the Pepperoni Thin 'N Crispy pizza contains 1,080 milligrams of sodium for every half slice. In Canada, that same half slice contains 718 milligrams of sodium. The salt was measured in milligrams per 3.5 ounce of pizza to eliminate the influence of portion size.We shouldn't have to cross the border to reduce our sodium intake. ""If Pizza Hut can serve less salty pizzas to their customers in Canada and New Zealand, the company should be able to slash salt levels in the American versions of the same -- and all its other -- pizzas,"" said Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.The dangers of consuming excess salt run the gamut: obesity, stroke and heart attack are just a few of the risks linked with overdoing it. It's not just Pizza Hut: A 2012 study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal revealed that fast food tended to be saltier in the U.S. than in other countries. Why this is seems to be a mystery. As Health.com reports, excess salt is not reflected in consumer demand or local tastes, and the U.S. is not limited in its food-processing technology, meaning sodium could be reduced if more specific guidelines were enforced.Even more, Pizza Hut slices in the U.S. were reported to be 40 percent larger than in other countries, which means when an American consumer eats a full meal at Pizza Hut, he or she is being set up to consume more calories, fat and salt than a person in another country doing the exact same thing. This isn't so surprising; Food portion size has been on the rise for decades in the U.S. And, in a logical correlation, so have obesity rates. The Pizza Hut review highlights a nation-wide crisis worth prioritizing. If America wants to get healthy, it appears the time has come to reevaluate the relationship Americans and the food industry have with food.H/t: Grub Street"

7,PARENTS,How To Avoid Sending The Wrong Message With Elf On The Shelf,Rebecca Adams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wrong-message-elf-on-the-shelf-_n_6261792.html,,2014-12-17,"Michael the Shelf Elf is tucked in stocking and the Enger's home in Downers Grove, Ill., Dec. 9, 2013. (Chuck Berman/Chicago Tribune/MCT via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e6df1240000500053fc09.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Elf on the Shelf sees you when you're sleeping; he knows when you're awake. And he'll tell Santa if you've been good so that you can be rewarded with gifts on Christmas morning -- because whether we like it or not, material rewards are pretty effective motivators. That's the impetus behind Elf on the Shelf, a doll based on a fictional character plucked from the Christmas traditions of Christa Pitts and Chanda Bell and their mom, Carol Aebersold. When Pitts and Bell were little girls, their mother would place a toy elf named Fisbee in various places around the house from Thanksgiving until Christmas Eve. Fisbee was Santa's personal dispatch and would watch over them to see if they were well-behaved. That way, Santa could supply them with Christmas gifts accordingly.In 2005, this childhood game became a wildly popular product called The Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition.But, depending on how you spin it, the toy might be sending the wrong message to kids.There are people who feel that traditions like Elf on the Shelf put an undue emphasis on receiving gifts. Instead of encouraging kids to feel self-satisfaction from their virtuous deeds, parents may be inadvertently doling out extrinsic rewards to coerce good behavior.""There's a very clear message with something like [Elf on the Shelf] and with the whole Santa Claus 'naughty or nice' concept, which is: If you're good, you'll get stuff,"" Tim Kasser, a psychology professor at Knox College, told The Huffington Post.The thing is, all of that stuff isn't making kids happier. Studies have shown that the more people focus their lives around materialistic goals, the less satisfied and the more insecure they are. On the other hand, kids who are taught the value of gratitude have better grades and reduced rates of depression. A 2014 study by Joseph Grenny and David Maxfield, co-authors of Influencer: The New Science of Leading Change, gauged how the framing of the holiday affects kids' behavior. They gathered 58 kids between the ages of 5 and 8 for a Christmas party with Santa. Each child participant was partnered with another child to meet with Santa. For half of the pairs of kids, Santa would ask the standard question: What do you want for Christmas? For the other half, Santa would switch up the traditional framing: What presents are you excited to give someone for Christmas? They were then given the chance to pick either a large piece of chocolate or a small piece of chocolate, knowing that their partner would get the one they didn't choose.Of the children presented with the traditional framing, 67 percent took the larger chocolate. For children who heard the generous framing, only 53 percent took the larger chocolate. The discrepancy between the two groups may not be enormous (and the sample itself is pretty small), but these findings suggest that the way we frame Christmas for kids can encourage selflessness. See how Maxfield and Grenny conducted their study:What Daniel Cook, a professor of Childhood Studies and Sociology at Rutgers University-Camden, finds particularly noteworthy about the Elf on the Shelf is that it adds another layer to the holiday environment. The elf is intended to be a disciplinary mechanism, so the ""naughty or nice"" message, as it relates to gifts, can get an extra nudge.""It allows parents to displace their authority onto this secondary fantastical being, this elf, that is related to Santa,"" Cook said. ""In a way, both kids and parents become reliant on this elf on the shelf.""There are ways to use Elf on the Shelf in ways that will make your children more prone to giving.The thing about Elf on the Shelf is that it doesn't have to be billed as a gatekeeper of gifts. ""The words we use define what Christmas means to our children,"" Maxfield told The Huffngton Post. ""The Christmas cues, the way society and the way many parents talk about Christmas, sets up a scenario that would make even the most giving child be tempted to get, get, get."" Both Maxfield and Grenny say the solution is to have your kids make a sacrifice or take a personal initiative for someone else during Christmas -- perhaps to please the elf, but not for the purpose of receiving more gifts. Have them volunteer at a food bank, save up money for a relative's gift or donate some of their toys to less fortunate children. When children actually engage in altruistic behavior, that can make a huge impression on them. ""If you frame it as an opportunity to give, it creates its own rewards and intrinsic satisfaction for the child,"" Grenny said. The Elf on the Shelf can be helpful if you use it as a model of being generous when explaining it. The elf could be sticking around not just to decide if the child is worthy of receiving gifts; maybe it's there to remind kids that the spirit of Christmas is about giving. Bell, one of the toy's creators, said it’s ""really up to parents to determine how they use The Elf on the Shelf and experience the tradition with their children.""""Because the elf reports nice things back to Santa, it provides a great opportunity to encourage families to do kind deeds, give to charity or participate in philanthropy,"" Bell said. ""Santa can also deliver gifts that are not material in nature, like a donation to charity in a family's name, or something faith- or family-focused."""

For Simon Ting, this is the time of year for working harder than ever.Ting, 24, works at a Macy’s in San Francisco, and he’s paid largely on commission. That means the more he sells, the more money he makes -- and the holiday season is a great time for selling. Ting tries to be at Macy’s for as many of the store’s extended hours as he can during the holiday rush. He knows sales will be hard to come by after New Year’s. In past holiday seasons, when he staffed other retailers’ stores, Ting worked so much he slept on the stockroom floor between shifts. “I get a really massive amount of my paycheck during these two months, so I have to save that money,” Ting said. “After the holiday season is over, no one is really in the store anymore, and you don’t make any money anymore. That’s going to be really rough.” Ting isn’t alone. A steady paycheck has grown elusive for many Americans in an economic recovery dominated by part-time, low-wage work. That work is often in retail, where the holiday season is a time to put in as many hours as possible -- sometimes at multiple jobs and on holidays like Thanksgiving -- to build a cushion for leaner months. Those leaner months often come right after the holidays, as stores hire less, lay off seasonal employees and cut permanent workers’ hours to cope with slower sales. Retail companies typically boost payrolls by 3 percent to 4 percent from October to December, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That’s followed by a 5 percent to 6 percent decline in retail payrolls from December to February. “If you’re looking for extra money, or that’s the only job you can find, that’s better than nothing, but it’s certainly not something you can build a life on,” said Drew DeSilver, a senior writer at Pew who conducted the analysis. The people lucky enough to work for a retailer year-round typically make less after Christmas ends. Rank-and-file employees at clothing and clothing accessories stores made $266.64 a week, on average, in December 2013, according to BLS data that is not seasonally adjusted. The following month, that number fell to $248.35. This kind of income instability is becoming the norm for many people in many industries. Some are permanent employees of giant companies that use scheduling software to cut labor costs. Others are temporary workers never hired for a permanent gig. Either way, “people have lumpy hours throughout the year,” said Rachel Schneider, a senior vice president at the Center for Financial Services Innovation, a group dedicated to improving Americans’ financial health.“There are so many jobs where people just don’t know their full schedule,” Schneider said. That, combined with the fact that expenses like car maintenance and health care can be unpredictable, means that many households see dips and spikes in income throughout the year. This chart from U.S. Financial Diaries, a report by Schneider and colleagues, shows the dips and spikes in income of one of the families they studied. About 30 percent of American households have incomes that often vary from month to month, according to a July 2014 survey from the Federal Reserve. The survey was the Fed's first to explore the subject, but census data shows that the share of Americans with unstable incomes has increased in recent years. More than 30 percent of Americans were living in poverty for at least two months from 2009 to 2011 -- a 4.5 percent increase from the period 2005 to 2007. Poor families are more likely to be plagued by unstable paychecks. About half of households living below the poverty line said their income is hard to predict, compared with slightly less than 20 percent of those making 150 percent to 200 percent of the poverty line, according to the U.S. Financial Diaries, a report released earlier this month by Schneider's organization.  This chart from U.S. Financial Diaries shows that poor Americans are more likely to experience unstable incomes. Those on the left of the chart are living at less than 100 percent of the supplemental poverty measure, an alternative calculation of the poverty line. This year-round instability is part of the reason so many low-wage Americans find themselves working so much during November and December. “People use that time to make more money,” Schneider said. “I’m always working,” one 33-year-old Kmart worker said of the holiday season. In past years, the Michigan employee said he worked at the retail giant 30 hours a week in the lead-up to Christmas -- the most he could clock in and still be considered part-time. But come January, “then you get smacked right back down,” to very few hours, said the worker, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his job. The first time he worked a busy holiday season followed by a slow January, the worker, who makes minimum wage, said he was “stunned” when he looked at his first post-holiday paycheck. It was for just four hours a week, “so immediately I started looking for another job.” Each Kmart location ""bases its staffing needs on what they're anticipating for that particular store,"" Howard Riefs, a Kmart spokesman, wrote in an email. He added that the company ""has always been fortunate"" to have a mix of full-time, part-time and seasonal workers to staff its stores. ""We make every effort to provide the level of service that will give our members and customers the best shopping experience during the holidays and throughout the year,"" Riefs wrote.Still, it's been a struggle for the 33-year-old Kmart worker, even after finding a second job. He makes less than $9 an hour at both gigs.   Between the two jobs, he works more than 40 hours a week during the holiday season. But last year, during a slow period, Kmart didn’t schedule him to work a shift for nearly two months, forcing him to stretch what he had left of his holiday paycheck. “You have to budget your money as wisely as you can,” said the worker, who lives in his father-in-law’s house with his wife and brother-in-law and splits bills with them. “You cook everything at home, you don’t go anywhere you don’t need to go.” As for Ting, he tries to keep from “going crazy” worrying about money by moonlighting as a driver for Uber, Lyft and other ride-sharing services during the slow months. “Those are options, but it’s not stable,” he said, noting he makes about $150 before gas for about 8 hours of driving. Even with the extra cash, Ting said he struggles to afford car payments, health care bills and his $700 a month room in nearby Daly City, California. “After the holiday, you’re totally stuck,” he said.

It's also a good time to spotlight the top-quality movies that will vie for Oscars and be released in theaters and on DVD/VOD in weeks to come.  (Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures) David Oyelowo and Carmen Egojo co-star in the historical  bio/drama Selma, one of the 10 best films of 2014.Belle (***1/2) A mind-boggling story based on fact about a biracial female being raised in a white aristocratic home in 18-century England. Actress extraordinaire Gugu Mbatha-Raw lights up the screen in a very romantic and surprisingly socially-relevant tale. Lavish production elements. Nice acting all around. Strong writing by Misan Sagay. Smart direction by British director Amma Asante. Beyond the Lights (***) This ode to chanteuses fighting personal demons (Rihanna-types) is the brainchild of writer/director Gina Prince-Bythewood, who made the most romantic film of the year. A wayward pop/hip hop singer (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Belle) is rescued by a stoic cop (Nate Parker). A sweet, modern love story set in the soul-eating, kinetic music industry. Well-written, directed and acted.Birdman (****) It's not like Michael Keaton's career was kaput, but it seems like he raised himself from the dead with this invigorating performance. Mexican director/writer Alejandro González Iñárritu gave Keaton a plum role as a has-been actor and ex-super hero trying to make it big on Broadway. The line between reality and fantasy is blurred. Excellent acting from all involved including Ed Norton and Naomi Watts. Boyhood (****) Shooting a film over the course of 12 years takes patience and imagination. Writer/director Richard Linklater had that in abundance as he followed the life of a small boy into young adulthood. Patricia Arquette as the stalwart mom is superb and Ethan Hawke as the bungling dad is pretty good too. Dear White People (***) The narrative follows the plight of four black students at an almost all-white Ivy League school. Biting satire plays havoc with race relations. Credit filmmaker Justin Simien with a brilliant view on a complex subject and for equating Quentin Tarantino's Django with Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind. Bravo. Grand Budapest Hotel (***1/2) Wes Anderson's quirky films (The Royal Tenenbaums) have been an acquired taste only a few could love until this whimsical story about a snowy mountaintop hotel in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka. To hell with conventional storytelling, just throw in a confusing plotline, a bazillion cameos and wait for the dust to settle. Sweet ensemble acting. Tony Revolori, as the quirky bellboy Zero Moustafa, steals the movie. St. Vincent (***1/2) -- Something about saying grouch and eccentric and Bill Murray seems redundant. Murray is a Brooklyn neighbor who babysits the vulnerable kid next door. His idea of teaching the boy how to be a man involves betting on the horses, drinking in bars and beating up the class bully. Cool. Nicely directed by Theodore Melfi. Melissa McCarthy, Naomi Watts and Terrence Howard chew up the scenery in the year's best comedy.Selma (****) It's as if David Oyelowo was born to play Martin Luther King -- same nose, skin tone and cadence. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta is perfectly cast too. Smartly directed by Ava DuVernay, who steps out of the shadows of small indie filmmaking to create an Oscar-caliber, historical film that depicts the bravery of a civil rights activist and a fiery reverend who outsmarted LBJ and got the Voting Rights Bill passed. Inspiring.Starred Up (***/12) A violent British adolescent (Jack O'Connell, Unbroken) gets sent to a tough prison where his dad (Ben Mendolsohn) is a career jailbird. This brutal film makes HBO's Oz look like Sesame Street. Stark realism is so gruesome you can't look at the screen. Director David Mackenzie gets under the grimy skin of prison life in a way that will make you never one want to get arrested. Whiplash (***1/2) Who knew band practice could be coupled with emotional abuse? Young actor Miles Teller plays a very ambitious drum student at a prestigious music school who is tormented by an instructor (J.K Simmons), who is more sadistic than Satan. Damien Chazelle's script takes you places you didn't dream you'd go and his direction doesn't give you a way out. You'll stay until the best man wins.

This post was originally published on Coming of Faith.""The last ten nights of Ramadan is approaching us. I'tikaf will begin starting tomorrow night, so come worship all night at the masjid. It is very valuable in your faith. This is only for men, eighteen and up. Sisters, may Allah bless you and reward you.""The Imam at my local San Diego mosque makes this announcement right after the night prayer. I am disheartened by the lack of my invitation and even more crushed that women around me were not moved.The last ten nights of Ramadan are believed by Muslims to be better than a thousand nights of worship, specifically the odd nights. It is recommended to spend the night at the mosque in worship. This recommendation extends to all Muslims, yet mosques only allow men. It is as if the men who set these rules at the mosques, think that my vagina gives me the claim to faith without having to worship.There are many reasons that I have heard of why women can't spend the night, or sometimes even the day, in worship at God's house with other Muslims. ""Women don't need to come to the mosque."" ""It is not an obligation for women the way it is for men."" My favorite, ""it is not safe."" Not safe from whom? Will the Muslim men turn around and rape us?After worshiping in many mosques all over California, I finally found a mosque in Sacramento two years ago--while completing my Masters--that welcomed women and children to worship all night. Ramadan 2012 was the best of my twenty-seven years of life. Now, after moving to San Diego for medical school, I've realized that the SALAM (Sacramento Area League of Associated Muslims) Center is an elf from Mars, visiting the planet earth.The SALAM community has open hallways, where women are not pushed to a corner or upstairs behind shaded plastic walls. We sat behind the men like the way Muslims prayed over fourteen hundred years ago. Tissue boxes creating a delicate boundary across the grand hallway replace thick walls and dusty curtains. So many times, had I used those tissues from powerful khutbas, sermons, given by Imam Azeez. Traveling imams spoke to us, and some even came to the back and sat with us to address all of our concerns. I stood in prayer with a community, stayed up with the community, ate with the community, and broke fast with the community. I became a better human being because the community kept me accountable. More so, nowhere have I seen more people come into Islam then at SALAM.  I never needed community since, growing up, my Bengali immigrant mother forced me into a loner lifestyle of constant studying. Now, as an adult, I have a dead father, an estranged mother and brother, a non-Muslim sister, and friends that range from devout Christians to atheists. I am alone yet surrounded by people. Going through a divorce and not having a partner to eat breakfast with at 3:30am, pray with through out the day, and make love with into the night, I feel even more alone. Although my tight jeans and open hair do not fit in with the women in black dresses covered from head-to-toe, my lack of drinking, my fasting and five-times-daily prayer don't fit in with my friends either. I stopped trying to fit in, but rather appreciate the differences in others and still find a sense of community. In San Diego, the mosques are not open like SALAM and I hardly see my friends who can't relate to the sixteen hour fast from food and water and the nightly worship after fast breaks. I treasure community, but now I am back in an environment of non-Islamic Muslim brotherhood, which is not unique to San Diego.To tell women to pray at home, especially during the last ten nights of Ramadan, is dehumanizing. I am not a houseplant or a goldfish to be left by the window. There is a reason we stand so close, shoulder-to-shoulder in line during prayer at the mosques - because it is difficult to worship alone. It's almost impossible for me stay up in my cement block graduate housing room, by myself, praying and reading the Qur'an all night. It is important for local mosques to welcome men and women. Without SALAM, I would have been lost, as lost as I feel now in San Diego among the Muslim men's club. It is time for the Islamic ""brotherhood"" to be castrated. I am calling out to my local mosques in San Diego and all other mosques: stop taking women out of the house of God. We have the right to worship with the rest of the Muslims whenever we wish. Imams, please, I don't need your duas, prayers, I need you to let me in when I am at the door.I am not a feminist. I am a human being, deep in my faith and wanting to be part of a community that I can worship with and not be ostracized for being born the way I was.Suzanne Syeda Shah is a Muslim-Bengali-American born in Saudi Arabia and grew up in Los Angeles.

The film, starring US actors Seth Rogen and James Franco, is a comedy about a CIA plot to assassinate its leader Kim Jong-Un, played by Randall Park. North Korea has vowed 'merciless retaliation' against what it calls a 'wanton act of terror' -- although it has denied involvement in a massive cyber attack on Sony Pictures, the studio behind the film. AFP PHOTO/STR (Photo credit should read -/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae03801f00002e0122d3de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The definition of ""racism"" is ""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior."" Individual racism, which includes but is not limited to actions, ideology and language, leads to institutional racism. Most Americans would adamantly reject the notion that they are in fact racist.As a scholar and professor of intercultural and rhetorical communication, I study the intersections of language, action and ideology. These things are inextricably linked but not always explicitly discussed in tandem with one another. The interplay between language, action and ideology offers the missing piece in the analysis of these conversations that, in the age of ""new"" media, we've seen move from the private to the public sphere, such as the recent emails that have surfaced between film producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures Co-Chair Amy Pascal in which the two speculated that they should ask President Obama whether he likes movies such as Django Unchained, 12 Years a Slave or The Butler.The fact of the matter is that the media has a field day when high-profile executives and employees of high-profile companies are ""outed"" for making racist or prejudicial comments that move from the private to the public sphere. The attention to these stories rarely focuses on the actual problem with these moments, the actual ways in which language determines action and translates into hiring prejudice, firing prejudice, workplace exclusivity and institutional racism, among other things.We all remember April 2014, when Donald Sterling, the then-owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, told his girlfriend, in a private phone conversation that went public, that he didn't want her bringing black people to his games or posting pictures with black people on Instagram. These remarks were clearly racist, but the connection between Sterling's language and the institutional racism in which he's complicit was not made clear in the way that it needs to be. This connection reflects the reality that black people live with day in and day out, regardless of whether they work in a blue-collar job or a white-collar job.Sterling has long had a reputation for perpetuating institutional racism. In addition to owning the Clippers for many years, he is a real estate mogul who, in 2005, settled a lawsuit that accused him of discriminating against black and Hispanic tenants at properties he owned. He paid a large sum of money in response to another housing-discrimination lawsuit a few years later. In a statement released Thursday Pascal made claims that echo Sterling's own self-defense following the furor over his racist comments, saying, ""The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am."" But this defense, which essentially amounts to a pivot away from the significance of what those emails symbolize, is simply not enough. It does not excuse the magnitude of the prejudice on display in those emails, prejudice coming from a person who sits in a position of power in Hollywood, no less.Throughout life we develop knowledge about different types of people, which shapes how we communicate with one other, how we think about others and how we treat others. When racist and prejudicial language such as this is used, we need to acknowledge that what we say and think absolutely influences our actions. These stereotypes and schemas that we carry with us create ""crash moments"" when interacting with different types of people. Crash moments look like José Zamora changing his name to ""Joe"" on his résumé and suddenly getting an influx of interviews for jobs because his name no longer indicated a non-white ethnicity.Crash moments also look like the following: When Officer Darren Wilson and Mike Brown met on the street, each party was operating on a set of assumptions about the other -- and in many cases such assumptions are prejudices based on past experiences and/or environmental forces that govern our actions. At trial, Officer Wilson's description of Brown's face as looking ""like a demon"" following the initial discharge of Wilson's gun inside his vehicle, and his description of Brown as later looking ""like he was almost bulking up to run through the shots"" that Wilson was firing at him, are impregnated with historical images of black males as ""beasts"" or ""savages"" that permeate our psyche and play into how we communicate with and about others. Crash moments also look like Eric Garner displaying his frustration with white police officers ""harass[ing]"" him for no apparent reason. His past interactions with white police officers fueled and guided his response in that moment. These sorts of schemas, stereotypes and pseudo-impressions guide everyone, no matter your skin color.This is not to say that Wilson, Sterling, Pascal or Rudin are racist (I am not here to make that judgment), but they all have used language that absolutely interplays with racist ideology and action. These things can in no way be separated from institutional practices and the treatment of people of color. Again, Sterling had a long history of discriminatory housing practices and has settled lawsuits alleging racial discrimination.Linguistic scholar Kenneth Burke tells us that when we use language, we are also used by it. Words set our actions, views and perspectives, which means people cannot see beyond what their words lead them to believe. Thus, language exerts a determining influence over us, an influence that we cannot always escape unless we are willing to acknowledge that racist jokes, prejudicial language and stereotypical acknowledgements will always cloud the ways we treat different types of people. Everyone, no matter their skin color, is a victim in this determinism. It is just more devastating for people of color, because people of color are often on the opposite side of those in power in a country in which white people hold the economic and structural reins of power. Therefore, when white people harbor prejudicial, racist or stereotypical assumptions, the effect disproportionately disadvantages people of color in a more devastating way -- whether it be in hiring practices, firing practices, workplace exclusion, police brutality or the way the justice system works. Language does reflect the decisions, practices and actions that one makes, whether consciously or unconsciously."

(Photo by John Shearer/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cf833bb210000fd08e6b2dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jessica Chastain really loves movies. ""I think if I wasn't an actor, I would be an entertainment journalist,"" Chastain said during a recent interview at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The actress, an Oscar nominee who has starred in four movies this year, recalled a story about how when she first went to the Cannes Film Festival in 2011, she expected to see a lot of great movies. But when she didn't have time, changes were made to how she schedules out her film festival commitments.""Now I say I will go, but they need to give me time to go see other people's films,"" Chastain said. ""I saw 'Mommy' at Cannes this year, and from that I'm now working with Xavier Dolan."" The 25-year-old Dolan is one of the world's fast-rising talents, and his next film, ""The Death and Life of John F. Donovan,"" stars Chastain as a tabloid editor with a heart of stone. ""I thought, 'People in the U.S. don't know about this guy and he's so talented, and I'm going to do everything I can to help him out,'"" Chastain said of her interest in Dolan. ""It also helps me, because I'm excited to work with this artist.""Working with artists is another thing Chastain loves. Her recent list of directors includes Liv Ullmann (""Miss Julie""), Ned Benson (""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby""), Christopher Nolan (""Interstellar"") and J.C. Chandor (""A Most Violent Year""). It's Chandor's film that has Chastain's attention at the moment. Following a much publicized tug-of-war between her press commitments to Nolan's ""Interstellar"" and ""A Most Violent Year,"" Chastain has focused on promoting her work in the New York-set drama. In a year of great Chastain performances, it might be her best: She plays Anna Morales in Chandor's film, the wife to a heating oil czar named Abel (Oscar Isaac). Anna's been described as a Lady MacBeth type, but Chastain prefers comparison to another famous figure: former vice president Dick Cheney. ""He was my inspiration for the character,"" she said. Like Cheney, Anna works behind the curtain, watching with consternation as Abel tries to take their legitimate business to the next level in an increasingly criminal climate.""She has this Freudian thing where she loves her dad [a former mob boss]. He's the most powerful man in the room, and she wants to be with a man who is the most powerful man in the room,"" Chastain said of Anna. ""When Abel starts doing things that her father wouldn't do -- when they start to get attacked and he's handling it in a way that she thinks shows weakness -- that's when she starts to really step forward. She thinks her husband is absolutely her king. But she'll do these things where she'll lift him up and celebrate him as her king, and then the next second emasculate him. She's not even aware she's doing it.""It's a flashy role for Chastain, both in screen action (she shoots a deer with a handgun at one point) and wardrobe. Wearing low-cut gowns and a blonde wig straight out of ""Scarface,"" Chastain transforms herself in a way that she hasn't since her Oscar-nominated turn in ""The Help.""""Anna has the long nails because there's something predatory about her. She's a woman who does not bathe her children or do housework. I wanted to make that clear,"" Chastain said. ""She is a girl from Bayside, Brooklyn. She thinks she doesn't have an accent, she thinks with all this money she can wear these expensive clothes, but there's still something about her that is the edge of where she came from.""Chastain came from Sacramento, but studied at Juilliard with Isaac, whom she recommended for the role in ""A Most Violent Year"" after Javier Bardem dropped out (""Jessica gets a casting director credit for it,"" Chandor joked in an earlier interview with HuffPost Entertainment). Since her breakout 2011 -- which included not just ""The Help,"" but also ""The Tree of Life"" and three other films -- Chastain has been one of Hollywood's busiest stars. (She's currently filming ""The Martian"" with director Ridley Scott and star Matt Damon.) But she still manages to find time to engage with fans on Twitter, often posting about real-world issues such as race, diversity and Hollywood's problems with both.""I'm so vocal about it because I'm an audience member, and I want to see more voices out there,"" Chastain said, before citing Dolan as an example of someone who ""creates films about the voiceless."" She also brought up Chris Rock's recent editorial in The Hollywood Reporter, which took Hollywood to task for a lack of screen representation for black woman and Mexicans, among many other groups. ""Everyone thinks this is ridiculous. Everyone is saying there is not enough diversity in the industry,"" Chastain said. ""Which makes this an exciting time right now. Because it's definitely a point of conversation. When everyone is talking about it, things have to change.""Chastain's schedule remains busy -- in addition to Scott and Dolan, Chastain also recently worked with Guillermo Del Toro -- but, so far, she does not have a franchise film on the docket. But Chastain's name has come up in conversation as a popular choice to play Captain Marvel for Marvel, and while the superhero was not broached during this interview, she did weigh in on the genre.""I was talking to friends about superheroes, and someone actually said, 'Female superhero characters fail at the box office.' I said, 'A female character where her sole power is her sex and her sexual attraction is not an interesting thing to watch. If a woman is there posing and trying to be sexy, no one is interested in that,'"" Chastain said. ""If you look at Sigourney Weaver in 'Aliens,' Jennifer Lawrence in 'Hunger Games' -- they are superheroes. They're not selling their sex. They make a ton of money because they're smart women. I'm telling these people to make a character like that. So instead of look at me in this tight outfit, she's a badass.""""A Most Violent Year"" is out in limited release on Dec. 31."

This new piece of art, created by local street artist Jules Muck, serves as camouflage for the lobby's central bar area, which is currently undergoing reconstruction.Rather than let the hotel's clientele gaze upon bare plywood during the weeks before the new bar's unveiling, the decision was made to recruit a street artist to bring diversion to the room, along with a contextually unexpected kind of aesthetic stimulation. The artwork, a group of large panels measuring 7 feet high and 30 feet long, was painted by Muck in the hotel lobby over the course of a week (other than the spray painting, which had to be done in the hotel's garage due to the messiness factor).Muck, whose home and studio are both located in nearby Venice, developed her skills in New York City, where she served as an apprentice to renowned street artist Lady Pink. Known locally for numerous murals she's created throughout LA, particularly near the Venice Boardwalk, Muck's also painted sets for Californication, while her artwork's been exhibited at the Tokyo International Exhibition Center, the Bronx Museum of Art, and locally at the Pacific Design Center, Lab Art Gallery, and Rivera Gallery. The whimsical panels depict a group of acid-green elephants strolling on the beach, set against a Tiffany-blue sky and punctuated by hot-air balloons. I asked Muck, ""Why elephants?"" She explained that as the hotel is concealing their bar renovation, the area is ""The elephant in the room, so let's celebrate it and make it fun. This is a freakin' fancy place, but it's also really fun and it's been very welcoming to me.""

We explored CamelBak's corporate headquarters and learned all about how they do marketing from CMO, Chris Strain, who came over recently from shoe giant Vans to run things. We got the grand tour from CEO, Sally McCoy who is a legit outdoor person with experience climbing a little mountain called Everest. I really got a great sense of their culture and noticed that almost everyone had a CamelBak bag ready to go on their desk at the first chance to get outside. There are bikers, hikers and other sports enthusiasts at CamelBak everywhere and you can tell they live the ""work hard, play hard"" philosophy. [Watch the full video of our experience...]  The experience left me thinking that there are some important parallels of going on an adventure and running a successful company. In other words, what makes an outdoor adventure great is the same thing that can make a company great. Here is my checklist to make sure you choose the right people to join you:  You need people who...  1.  Are willing to climb togetherSally reminded me that when you're outdoors, you're as strong as whomever is feeling strong, weak or injured at the time. There's a good lesson here. Unlike free climbing, which is a lot riskier and usually done alone, climbing with others as a team and using the proper equipment can help you reach greater heights.For example, stronger climbers usually go up first and secure the line, then ensure team members below who are linked via rope and carabineers can make the accent. Each person in the chain makes sure they do their job so that the entire group can make it to the top. If someone slips or falls, the equipment or other person will save them. Do you work with people who have your back?2.  Have a good sense of humorLet's face it, we all have bad days in the office. But great companies have people who are resilient and keep their wits when times are tough. Sally said that out on the mountain she would try and be a leader by keeping up morale with funny sarcastic comments like, ""Well we're cold but at least we're wet."" Does your leadership have the vision and make it ok to have some fun or fail in the middle of hardship? Do you have people who are excited about the challenge or who have at the very least signed up for it?3. Stand for somethingAny great team needs to stand for or stand up for something. By this I mean CamelBak not only makes solid products which they guarentee for life, they are also trying to improve the world they play in. Case in point: CamelBak bottles, hydration packs and the new Relay filtered water pitchers have been developed as part of a larger vison for this eco-friendly company to help people ""ditch the disposable."" Billions of tons of plastic, including water bottles, are floating and littering the oceans and land fills. CamelBak has a serious sustainability mission at the heart of their existence. For them it truly is about taking care of their playground.
