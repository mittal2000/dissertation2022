0,WELLNESS,Life Is How You See It: Why It's Important to Uncover the 'Big Picture',"Donna L., Contributor
Author, ""The Healers Trilogy""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shift-perspective_us_5b9d1f83e4b03a1dcc84a820,"When you are able to see the big picture and realize what is actually going on, you will quietly and calmly become the master of your own life. Your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors will carefully calibrate themselves with clarity, peace, understanding, and truth in order to define a happy life.",2013-05-04,Woman holding an old frame against a blue cloudy sky. Blurred background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1f8325000036003654cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Life is all about perception. What one person sees as reality may be completely different from what another person in the same situation may see. It all depends on how our individual thoughts, feelings, and behaviors shape our world. If we could only take a step back and look, I mean really look, at how we react to situations and interact with other people, we would learn so much about ourselves. It is in this self-awareness that we ultimately find happiness, living life in the ""big picture.""There are three overall stances we can take in any life experience, and each one has the potential to show us a whole lot about our perceptions:1) Bumping HeadsWhen people ruffle our feathers, it's because we allow ourselves to become enmeshed in a negative way in what's happening. For instance, maybe your child comes home from school in a bad mood. He or she apparently got their feelings hurt by another child, and has decided to take it out on you. Your child has a complete meltdown right in front of you. What do you do? Start having your own meltdown right back at them... of course! The energy level escalates as you let your child take you down the rabbit hole. And we all know that the only thing this accomplishes is major aggravation and frustration. No one is listening. Nothing is being learned. The rational parent in you has ""left the building.""So what is this situation supposed to show you in the big scheme of things? Well, probably that you have a belief that is being challenged. It is true that your child's release of negative energy toward you technically had nothing to do with you. However, the fact that you became so worked up and knocked off balance because of it does have something to do with you. Step back and look at it from an observer's point of view. Are you seeing in your child a side of yourself that you do not like? Is your child actually mirroring for you behaviors that you yourself exhibit from time to time? Has he or she triggered feelings inside of you that need healing, like impatience, anger, or hurt? This experience then becomes a positive one if you are able to learn from it. It gets you one step closer to your authentic self. Think about it. It will help you understand and react more calmly to this type of unpleasant situation in the future.2) Shutting Down  Shutting down is the other end of the spectrum. It means we have totally disengaged. This stance is just as ineffective. You avoid a situation altogether, and by doing so, you can never learn anything about yourself. No evolving is allowed to occur. Having interactions with others, no matter how difficult, is the way we find out who we really are. There is intrinsic value in going outside our comfort zones. We grow as a result of it. I believe that is why each of us is here -- to become who we truly are, and we'll never find that out unless we engage in the world around us, even though it can be painful. In the end, the rewards are quite worth it!3) Holding Space What do I mean by ""holding space""? I mean staying centered, remaining balanced, being present but not participating in the drama unfolding in front of you. Picture yourself encased within a protective bubble. This bubble has a turquoise and pink iridescence to it. It represents your throat chakra (self-expression) and your heart chakra (feelings). You are essentially playing the role of witness to that which you see and hear. You are not taking this personally. You realize it is not about you. There are larger forces at work here. You are simply watching and observing. You say to yourself, ""This child is very upset. He must be in the middle of a life lesson."" Allow him to feel and release what he needs to. Remember that people are at different psychological and emotional levels. Try to see from that perspective. Others have to be allowed to release in order to rise to the next level. If you try to fix or control the situation, you keep them from evolving. So show him only love. Stay in ""the continuum"" -- not too engaged, not too disengaged. It's a balancing act. Project positive energy and show compassion, and the episode will almost instantly be defused because of it. You will have passed a test of becoming more of your true self, and your child will have learned more from your powerful, gentle example than anything else could possibly teach him.Life experiences are meant to align our personality with our soul and all that it is made of: harmony, peace, love, and so on. When we look for a deeper reason for the events that present themselves in our lives, we consciously participate in our soul's evolution. If what someone does or says irritates you, upsets you, or otherwise ""hits a nerve"" in some way, it does have to do with how you see yourself and the world around you. However, if you do not assume a defensive or critical stance -- the need to control or dominate the situation -- and focus on the soul of the other person, you will move past the incident without allowing it to negatively impact you. You will have passed the test. When you are able to see the big picture and realize what is actually going on, you will quietly and calmly become the master of your own life. Your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors will carefully calibrate themselves with clarity, peace, understanding, and truth in order to define a happy life. You will have no need to prove your mastery. You will live it. You will radiate your own empowerment. It will come through in everything you say and do and be deeply felt by others.

Sumi Abedin, a survivor of the Tazreen",2013-05-04,"Relatives react after identifying the body of a loved one killed in last week's building collapse in Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, on May 3, 2013. The death toll from last week's collapse of a garment factory complex in Bangladesh passed 500 Friday as the country's prime minister said Western retailers had to share some of the blame for the tragedy. AFP PHOTO/Munir uz ZAMAN (Photo credit should read MUNIR UZ ZAMAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2f39c250000cf0038966c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Major clothing brands like to say they have a system in place to avoid doing business with overseas suppliers that mistreat their workers: The corporate-funded factory audit, performed by credentialed inspectors and designed to weed out bad actors.But for the past six years, Abu Bakar, a Bangladeshi garment worker in the sprawling industry hub of Gazipur, has helped create the clothes for which Western buyers seem to have boundless demand. In that time, he's developed his own idea of what a factory audit is.That's when the foreigners show up to scrutinize everything he and his colleagues do -- not for the sake of safety, but for the sake of production. They make sure that the clothes are dyed right. That the shirts button properly. And that the right amount of product is going out the door in the right amount of time.In all his time on the floor, Bakar said he has never been interviewed as part of a factory safety audit. His concept of an audit is pure production anxiety.""No one turned up at our factory to ask about fire safety after the Tazreen fire,"" Bakar, who works in the dye department of his factory, told HuffPost in Bengali. The Tazreen factory was the site of a massive fire in November that claimed the lives of 112 mostly impoverished garment workers, many earning as little as $37 a month. Bakar's factory sits roughly 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from Tazreen.The death of more than 520 workers in the horrific collapse of Rana Plaza last week has raised fresh questions about the effectiveness of factory audits underwritten by Western brands. Two of the factories inside the building had undergone audits overseen by a monitoring group, the Business Social Compliance Initiative, which was created by a European industry group, the Foreign Trade Association. Similarly, last year, after more than 260 workers died in a factory fire in Pakistan, it was revealed that the plant had recently been green-lighted by a different industry-funded auditing group, U.S.-based Social Accountability International.Many worker advocates criticize these auditing systems as well-meaning, but flawed, pointing to an inherent conflict of interest: The groups are largely funded by the very corporate members whose contracted facilities they're meant to monitor. The auditing process, these critics claim, ends up catering more to the brands involved than the workers toiling on the line, like Bakar, many of whom have never spoken to an inspector.Suruj Miah, who's worked on garment lines in Bangladesh for four years, told HuffPost he has never personally been interviewed for a factory audit, but knows colleagues who have been.""What to say to the auditors always comes from the owners,"" Miah said. ""The owners in most cases would warn workers not to say negative things about the factories. Workers are left without a choice.""Business Social Compliance Initiative didn't respond to interview requests from HuffPost. Lorenz Berzau, the group's managing director, told The Wall Street Journal that its auditors aren't building engineers and wouldn't have been able to determine structural problems at Rana Plaza. Most of what its audits find are wage and safety violations.""It's very important not to expect too much from the social audit,"" Berzau told the Journal. ""BSCI and other initiatives contribute to improve the situation. ... But it's a long way we have to go.""Such monitoring programs, known in the industry as ""social auditing"" groups, have become a mainstay for Western brands since the 1990s, when corporations decided to ramp up factory oversight in the wake of high-profile sweatshop scandals. With garments coming from countries like Bangladesh, where the enforcement of labor rights and workplace safety laws are notoriously weak, social auditing firms now serve as one of the few levels of scrutiny in a supply chain where catastrophic factory disasters, not to mention workplace abuses, have become common.As Berzau noted, only so much can be expected of the occasional audit, and such monitoring groups could never take the place of the strong government safety enforcement that is obviously lacking in Bangladesh. But the findings of Business Social Compliance Initiative's factory audits aren't available to the general public, or to the workers who toil in the factories being audited.According to the group's most recent annual report, ""Audit results are shared in a common database among BSCI's participating companies. This disclosure avoids multiple audits along with unnecessary costs and time spent for the companies and the producers.""More than 90 percent of the group's income in 2011 came from participating companies, according to the annual report. The rest came from the fees generated by audits.Given Business Social Compliance Initiative's strong code of conduct for businesses -- the right to free association for workers, no forced labor or overtime, a prohibition against child labor -- worker advocates said they'd love to see what the audits have turned up.""They have quite a database of information, which is really interesting for a lot of us,"" said Judy Gearhart, executive director of the International Labor Rights Forum. ""If only we knew what they found.""Our big gripe about all these systems,"" Gearhart went on, ""is that the auditors get hired, they go in, they do their report, and then if the brand finds it too difficult to fix, they walk away and don't tell anyone.""Brian Finnegan, global worker rights coordinator at the AFL-CIO labor union federation, said there needs to be more transparency -- as well as worker involvement -- throughout the social auditing industry.""Somebody audited it, somebody passed it or failed it -- but it's all in a black box,"" Finnegan said.The promise of increased vigilance from Western companies, paired with the rising number of factory tragedies, has led to pessimism among workers and industry observers in Bangladesh. Selim Ahmed, a journalist who's covered the garment industry in Savar, an industrial hub of hundreds of garment facilities, said he's heard the calls for stronger scrutiny before. He recalled a similar building collapse in 2005 that killed more than 75 people.""This time they talk about it, as too many people have died,"" Ahmed said. ""I know how this industry works. ... I'll be surprised if the promise to work on factory safety lasts more than six months from now.""In addition to social audit groups, retailers themselves often monitor the factories where their clothes come from. But regardless of who performs the inspection, the process is often opaque to the workers themselves.Worker advocates say coaching from supervisors is a widespread problem in Bangladesh. Sumi Abedin, a survivor of the Tazreen fire, recently told HuffPost that she knew of workers being ordered to wear ""fire safety committee"" T-shirts at her plant, even though no such committee actually existed. Workers were also provided with temporary fire equipment on days when inspectors came, Abedin said. In that disaster, workers like Abedin were forced to leap from upper floors in the burning building, as exits were blocked and windows were grated.From the perspective of Miah, the four-year garment veteran, a safety audit brings an unusually busy day at the factory -- supervisors making sure the fire equipment is visible, and expired extinguishers being replaced with fresh ones. But once the inspectors are gone, such caution tends to vanish.""We do have firefighting equipment there,"" Miah said of his own factory. ""But we don't know how to use it."""

Speculation usually focuses on a small group of top Berkshire executives, among them insurance boss Ajit Jain and railroad leader Matt Rose.The 82-year-old Buffett, in response to a shareholder question, said he thinks all the time about what could go wrong at Berkshire after he is gone.""The key is preserving a culture and having a successor, a CEO that will have more brains, more energy, more passion for it than even I have ... We're solidly in agreement as to who that individual should be,"" Buffett said.Whoever ultimately takes over Berkshire will run a conglomerate that employs more than a quarter-million people in dozens of businesses worldwide, covering everything from ice cream to insurance and retail to railroads.Its breadth means that its performance is often seen as a barometer for the broader economy. Earlier Saturday, one of Buffett's top lieutenants said things were picking up but could improve further.""It feels like a 2 percent economy. If we want to see GDP click up to 3.5 percent, 4 percent, you need to see more consumption,"" said Rose, CEO of the railroad Burlington Northern, in an interview.Rose said BNSF was seeing ""across the board"" increases in demand to ship things like concrete, roofing tiles and cars.But as much as investors want to hear about Berkshire's growth potential and the state of the economy, some also attend the meeting just for a good laugh.The meeting opened, as it does every year, with a video montage. This year's included a duet between Buffett and singer Jon Bon Jovi and a take-off on the TV series ""Breaking Bad.""Some of the best comedy, though, usually comes in the verbal sparring between Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger over the course of the day. The two are close - they usually share an oversize box of peanut brittle during the meeting - but Munger's acerbic tongue pops out from time to time.""I come to see Charlie Munger needle Warren Buffett - only he can,"" said Sherman Silber, a doctor and shareholder.

Loblaw owns clothing brand Joe Fresh, which confirmed it had goods made at one of the factories in the doomed Rana Plaza factory.Benetton's first statement following the collapse on April 24 claimed, ""none of the companies involved are suppliers to Benetton Group or any of its brands.""

Learning the etiquette (or even the definition!) of all the types of attire as a guest -- or as a bride! -- can be a challenge. Here are the different types of wedding attire you may see on invites.1. White-tie and black-tie. White-tie is the most formal look for men; it includes a formal tailcoat, a white vest, and a white tie. Black-tie is slightly less formal; men can simply wear a tuxedo, and should take the ""black tie"" part literally, wearing an actual black tie (and vest or cummerbund). For both black-tie and white-tie events, women should wear a formal evening gown or a dressy cocktail dress and can go all out with hair, makeup, and jewels.

Women can wear the same as they would for a black-tie event: an evening gown or dressy cocktail dress. Photo by A Bryan Photo on Snippet & Ink on Loverly. 3. Semi-formal. Semi-formal is probably the most common type of wedding attire you'll see on invitations. A nice cocktail dress is a sure thing here, but women can also wear a dressy suit. When it comes to semi-formal weddings, just pay attention to the season and venue to help ensure you look appropriate. Wearing opaque black tights with your dress in the winter, or something with a slight retro feel for a vintage wedding will help you blend in while still looking nice. Photo by Alfred Angelo via Loverly. 4. Beach weddings.  Though beach weddings may seem casual, not all are; do a little research about the wedding when you're planning your outfit. If you get the impression that it's going to be a pretty formal event that just happens to take place on sand, wear a nice maxi dress with embellished flats or a dressy, summery cocktail dress with wedges. If the bride and groom describe it as laid-back, you can get away with a more casual maxi dress or a nice sundress. In either case, avoid anything that looks like a beach cover-up. Photo by Tracy Autem on Heart Love Always via Loverly. 5. Daytime weddings. Though ""daytime wedding"" isn't a type of attire, it's something of which you'll want to be aware. Cocktail dresses typically work for both day and evening weddings. But if the entire event will be over before nightfall, opt for a non-strapless cocktail dress; if it's a late afternoon or evening affair, strapless is likely fine. You can also take a cue from the bride here -- if she's wearing a less formal dress with sleeves, you can go that route, or opt for a pretty suit. Photo by Lane Dittoe on Bridal Musings via Loverly. 6. Casual weddings. A casual wedding is the perfect opportunity to wear a cute sundress, a pretty skirt and top, or even nice trousers with a pretty top. But unless the host specifically said that blue jeans are OK, skip them. Photo by Brandi Welles on Inspired by This via Loverly. While you may specify the suggested attire on your invitations, you can also help ease guests' anxiety by putting more details on your wedding website and relying on word of mouth to let the guests know what to wear. Here are some things you may want to mention.Any traditions based on your and your partner's cultures or the wedding's location. Guests want to look appropriate, so if your culture, religion, or region dictates any clothing requirements or restrictions, let guests know in advance.If you're wearing a non-traditional dress. You don't have to post pics of the dress on the wedding website, but if you're not wearing a white gown, let your guests know what color they should avoid by adding something like, ""Semi-formal attire. (P.S. The bride's wearing pink!)"" to the invites. And if it truly is a casual wedding: ""The bride and groom will be wearing jeans!""What the weather will be like. If many guests are traveling, let them know the typical weather for your destination at that time of year so they know whether to bring a warm coat or an umbrella.Any notes about what shoes they may want to wear. If you're getting married outside in the grass, a note on the website like, ""The reception is in a garden so the bride and bridesmaids will be wearing wedges"" will let guests know that this is not the time to bust out the spike heels. You can also add ""Shoes not required"" for a beach wedding so guests don't stress about finding beach-appropriate heels.Want more awesome wedding advice?

While you may specify the suggested attire on your invitations, you can also help ease guests' anxiety by putting more details on your wedding website and relying on word of mouth to let the guests know what to wear. Here are some things you may want to mention.Any traditions based on your and your partner's cultures or the wedding's location. Guests want to look appropriate, so if your culture, religion, or region dictates any clothing requirements or restrictions, let guests know in advance.If you're wearing a non-traditional dress. You don't have to post pics of the dress on the wedding website, but if you're not wearing a white gown, let your guests know what color they should avoid by adding something like, ""Semi-formal attire. (P.S. The bride's wearing pink!)"" to the invites. And if it truly is a casual wedding: ""The bride and groom will be wearing jeans!""What the weather will be like. If many guests are traveling, let them know the typical weather for your destination at that time of year so they know whether to bring a warm coat or an umbrella.Any notes about what shoes they may want to wear. If you're getting married outside in the grass, a note on the website like, ""The reception is in a garden so the bride and bridesmaids will be wearing wedges"" will let guests know that this is not the time to bust out the spike heels. You can also add ""Shoes not required"" for a beach wedding so guests don't stress about finding beach-appropriate heels.Want more awesome wedding advice?

8,DIVORCE,Disparity Between Child Support and Custody Enforcement,"Joseph E. Cordell, Contributor
Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disparity-between-child-support_us_5b9d170ee4b03a1dcc845bf7,It is evident that the enforcement of child support and visitation are treated separately in the civil system. The law is quick and severe when child support is not paid but is largely toothless when a father is denied seeing his children.,2013-05-03,Young couple is back to back because of their problems,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d170e1f00005000217949.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You'll read about it often -- the creative methods judges and other officials use to shame people who owe child support.There is the man ordered not to procreate. The guy who must tell any female he meets that he owes child support. The dads forced to display signs proclaiming themselves ""deadbeats.""Much is made of the offensive moniker ""deadbeat dads"" and the histrionic punishments doled out by zealous judges.However, throughout my 20+ years with Cordell & Cordell advocating for fathers' rights, it is apparent the more pertinent story is the paucity of attention, much less innovation, given the reciprocal problem relating to primary custodians that defy court orders respecting the other parent's access and participation in children's lives.The disparity between enforcement of failing to pay child support and custodial interference is particularly calamitous for fathers, who represent 87.1 percent of child support payers and 82.6 percent of noncustodial parents, according to the U.S. Census.One might argue that the incongruity evidences the financial responsibility of rearing a child is held in higher regard than the emotional connection of a child to a parent.Allow me to explain.Child Support EnforcementWhat happens to a father who is unable to maintain his child support payments, even after only a few months of failing to pay? Enforcement is swift, heavy-handed, and can be brought about privately, by hiring private counsel, or by utilizing a local child support enforcement office. Sometimes the individual owed child support will not have to ask for assistance. If the offender has met certain thresholds for noncompliance, such as a failure to pay for three consecutive months, the enforcement office may step in and seek to enforce the child support order without prompting from the other party. Depending on the jurisdiction, several penalties may be carried out administratively or ""extra-judicially"" without the need for judicial intervention or a hearing in court. The offending individual may receive notice that their driver's license is being suspended, their passport is being confiscated, their vehicle is being repossessed, a lien has been placed on their property, or their federal tax return will be intercepted.Jail time, while rare, is still a real and unnerving possibility for many fathers.When dealing with custodial interference, there are far fewer options for enforcement.Custodial Interference Enforcement OptionsConsider what happens when an ex-spouse ignores the court-ordered parenting time scheduled and keeps the children from the other parent.The father goes to pick the kids up, but the ex-wife won't let them leave the house. The dad is supposed to have Father's Day with the kids this year, but she took them to see their grandfather. The initial reaction is to call the police. Good luck with that. Typically, law enforcement will not help enforce visitation. Rather than request assistance from a local authority or wait for an agency to step in, visitation is treated as a civil matter.Therefore, an individual must either choose to a family law attorney or attempt to maneuver the legal system on their own.Court-appointed attorneys for proceedings to enforce visitation are rare. Further, fewer legal aid resources are offering assistance when it comes to cases involving visitation and custody matters.Thus, enforcement becomes a matter of the ability of a party to afford representation to enforce the order, styled either as a motion for contempt or motion to modify. If an individual is not comfortable or savvy enough to file for enforcement on their own and cannot afford to hire counsel, then they typically are without means to enforce the visitation order.Disparity in EnforcementIt is evident that the enforcement of child support and visitation are treated separately in the civil system. The law is quick and severe when child support is not paid but is largely toothless when a father is denied seeing his children.Through both the financial ability to enforce, the variety of punishments, and access to remedies that extend the judicial system to administrative matters, the disparity of enforcement is blatant."
9,WELLNESS,10 Reasons Why Meditation Is America's New Push-Up for the Brain,"Robert Piper, Contributor

With all the scientific evidence coming in over the years, meditation is now becoming a practice that anyone from any walk of life can embrace.",2013-05-03,"Woman meditating in a yoga studio, Vancouver, British Columbia",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d185b2200003000d97da0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The push-up is an incredible tool to help you get in great physical shape; that's why it's used in almost every gym in America. With all the scientific evidence pointing to mindfulness meditation, the practice is literally becoming America's next push-up for the brain. Here are 10 reasons why you should do the practice. 1. It may make you happier.The practice helps you to cultivate more positive states of mind; if you're happy you will do better in every area of your life. Emotions are contagious, and when you're happy you spread that feeling to everyone around you. 2. There's evidence that it strengthens the brain.A study done at UCLA suggest that meditation actually strengthens the brain in a good way. Studies like this are pointing to the fact that meditation is literally a workout for the brain. How about right before you do your sit-ups, you incorporate some meditation to strengthen the brain? 3. It may help you focus at work.Our hectic, technology-filled lifestyle is talking all of our attention; we're constantly checking emails, Facebook updates, and our Twitter accounts. A new study suggested that meditation may make you more focused at work. 4. It could make you a more compassionate person. Meditation helps you to calm down by centering your focus on your breathing and the sensations in your body. It also helps you recognize positive emotions within your own body, and to use those emotions to act more compassionate toward others. A new study from Northeastern University and Harvard University researchers showed that people who meditated acted more compassionate afterward than those who did not meditate. 5. It may help you lose weight. Mindfulness is a way to pay attention to the all the sensations you're experiencing. When you do meditation while you're eating, you become more conscious of what you're putting in your mouth. 6. It may relieve stress.A study in the journal Health Psychology showed that mindfulness decreased levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This is something everyone in American could use, considering stress has literally become an epidemic here. 7. It may help you do better in school.A new study done in the journal Mindfulness showed that meditation improved the test scores of students in a psychology class. Some of the students meditated before the lecture, and another group did not. After the lecture, the ones who meditated did better. Want your kids to do better in class -- why not show them how to meditate?8. It may help American troops. A number of programs are working with troops to give them the tools of meditation to better their quality of life. Organizations like Project Welcome Home Troops, the Mind Fitness Training Institute, and the the Samueli Institute are using it with troops. 9. It positively changes the brain, even when you're not meditating. A new study has indicated that by participating in an eight-week meditation program, you can potentially change how the brain works even when you're not meditating. The brain is just like a muscle you work out at the gym: If you do meditation every day, it's going to positively influence your life. 10. It may help protect against colds. A study done at the University of Wisconsin-Madison showed that people who practiced mindfulness meditation or engage in physical exercise suffered less from colds than those who did not. Cheers to America's new push-up for the brain! With all the scientific evidence coming in over the years, meditation is now becoming a practice that anyone from any walk of life can embrace. You don't have to practice any religion or have any set of beliefs to use this incredible tool for the brain.Also On HuffPost: 7 Unusual Meditation PracticesFor more by Robert Piper, click here.For more on meditation, click here."

If you're a woman that's had trouble processing your divorce, these are a couple of things that I'd like you to do to really start to understand.",2013-05-03,Angry couple attempting starting their day by ignoring each other,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d07782100005100c55b30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We have a great question today from Maureen:Why do married men of 20 years suddenly leave their wives and immediately start dating other women?My husband did this to me; he woke up one morning and said, 'I need to move on.'Three weeks later, while still living in the basement of the family home with me and the kids, he started dating a woman that he's now married to. Why does this happen? Shouldn't his new wife be very concerned? This leaves me very shaken even three years later, very scared to get involved with any man again. I know you always say don't worry about why. But I need to know or I'm going to go mad.. . .Here's the deal, Maureen:Men don't just suddenly leave. A lot of men and a lot of women are poor communicators. A marriage for 20 years had warning signs probably for 10 years. Marriages don't just end overnight. Nobody just wakes up, turns over and looks at their partner of 20 years and says, ""Hey, this isn't working out for me. Last night was great, but you know what, I want to end this marriage today.""When a marriage ends, it's been ending for a long time, except one party always seems to be blind to all the warning signs.If you're a woman that's had trouble processing your divorce, processing why your marriage ended, these are a couple of things that I'd like you to do to really start to understand.One of the first things you need to do is really go back in time and take a look at the warning signs. They were there the whole time.Think about maybe a vacation you took apart.Think about how often he was working late.Think about the lack of conversations; think about how you weren't intimate. So many things were going wrong in that relationship. A relationship never just ends; it ends slowly. It ends over time.Think about the communication between the two of you. Were the talks deep? Did you talk about the relationship? Did you talk about things that would move the relationship forward?A lot of men -- and a lot of women -- have trouble going deeper into what I would call the intimacy zone.They tend to accept things the way that they are. They're afraid to voice their opinion; they're afraid to talk about things. And then all of a sudden the relationship seems to end out of nowhere.This is the hardest thing for most people to understand: Don't take it personally. Yes, you were probably blind to all the warning signs. But then again, you probably chose to be blind because you didn't want to admit, deep down, that the relationship really was not as satisfying as you wanted it to be.You probably weren't satisfied on so many levels as well. When this happens to a woman, a lot of times they will concentrate on the hurt. They'll concentrate on the why instead of really going deeper and thinking of themselves.This relationship didn't really work for me. This was a relationship that did not satisfy me.It's time for you to go inward; it's time to look and really pinpoint the reasons why the relationship ended.It's never what it appears on the surface. Go deep inward and don't be afraid to move forward. The next relationship you've learned from so many things in this past relationship.Keep the communication going. Keep your feelings going.And don't become so numb.It's a beautiful thing when this happens, because it's a great life lesson. But there are plenty of amazing men out there that still want to meet you."
