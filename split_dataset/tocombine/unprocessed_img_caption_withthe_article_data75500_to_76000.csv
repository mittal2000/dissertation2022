0,TECH,The Ad Industry Is Finally Promising To Make Online Ads Less Terrible,Alexander Howard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/internet-advertising-bureau-improvements_us_56212679e4b069b4e1fbe643,"""We messed up,"" says executive from the Internet Advertising Bureau.",2015-10-16,The advertising industry is looking for new ways to prevent frustrated consumers from blocking their ads.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562139cb1200002e007e5502.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The impact of Apple’s ad blocking technology on the future of the Internet came faster than we might have expected. On Thursday, the Internet Advertising Bureau acknowledged it had failed Internet users, pursuing automation and optimization that made money but that ultimately cost the industry consumer loyalty.“We messed up,” wrote Scott Cunningham, senior vice president of technology and ad operations at the Internet Advertising Bureau, the industry organization that represents over 650 different organizations, including many of the biggest global media outlets. ""As technologists, tasked with delivering content and services to users, we lost track of the user experience.”The explosion in ad-blocking apps over the last month has shown how much pent-up consumer demand there was for removing ugly, invasive, memory-hogging and insecure ads from our mobile devices and computers. While ad-supported publishers depend upon advertising revenue -- including The Huffington Post and its parent company, AOL, which makes advertising technology -- the consumer experience on today's Internet is often dreadful. Right now, in fact, you may be annoyed by the ads that overlay or surround this story.Beyond frustration about busy pages, however, ads can eat up limited data plans and drain precious battery life -- or, even worse, “malvertising” can infect unprotected devices with viruses and rootkits, which can give unauthorized users remote access to your computer.Now, the ad industry’s tech lab is promising to do better, developing ""L.E.A.N.” ads for hundreds of IAB member companies around world. L.E.A.N. stands for ""Light, Encrypted, Ad choice-supported, Non-invasive” ads. But it's unclear whether the industry can successfully deliver ads that require less bandwidth, are more secure and actually honor our choices about what kinds of ads we want to see and where. If the ad industry doesn’t succeed, the odds are good that more consumers will use ad blocking technology to block all ads, which could be disastrous for online publishers and media companies -- particularly smaller, independent media outlets. A study released in August by Adobe and PageFair, an Ireland-based firm that tries to recover ad-blocked revenue, estimated that almost 200 million people worldwide have installed ad blocking software in their Web browsers, which could cost publishers $22 billion in 2015 alone. There's also another factor driving this response from consumers: Facebook, Google and Apple are developing their own approaches to hosting ""Instant Articles"" and news inside their own platforms and sharing revenue with news organizations (including HuffPost), moving some media output away from the open Web entirely. Here’s hoping we all find a better balance between the needs of commerce and content, and creators and readers, soon.Also on HuffPost:"

2,POLITICS,House Democrats Press DOJ To Investigate If Exxon Broke The Law With A Climate Change Cover-up,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-climate-change-cover-up_us_562133a2e4b08d94253eff49,"Reports accuse ExxonMobil of hiding its research from decades ago, which tied fossil fuels to climate.",2015-10-16,Two House Democrats want Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate ExxonMobil.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Two House Democrats are urging Attorney General Loretta Lynch to launch an investigation into allegations that oil giant ExxonMobil hid research, which verified that fossil fuels play a role in global warming. In a letter to Lynch, Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) argue a probe is needed, to determine whether ExxonMobil broke the law.Lieu and DeSaulnier's request is based on two independent investigations published by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times, which document research conducted by a number of Exxon's senior scientists. Their findings warned of increases in the global temperature as a result of burning fossil fuels.""In this case, Exxon scientists knew about fossil fuels causing global warming and Exxon took internal actions based on its knowledge of climate change,"" Lieu and DeSaulnier wrote. ""Yet Exxon funded and publicly engaged in a campaign to deceive the American people about the known risks of fossil fuels in causing climate change."" ""If these allegations against Exxon are true then Exxon's actions were immoral,"" they added. ""We request the DOJ to investigate whether ExxonMobil's actions were also illegal.""The LA Times investigation found that while senior Exxon researcher Ken Croasdale studied the long-term impact of climate change on the companies operations, Exxon was ""crafting a public policy position that sought to downplay the certainty of global warming.""The Inside Climate News piece chronicled work by Exxon scientist James Black, going all the way back to July 1977 when he told the company's management committee that the ""most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels.""The publication noted that Black's assessment and presentations to Exxon bosses came before a majority of the world was aware of climate change and its potentially devastating effect on the environment.Lieu and DeSaulnier offered a damning critique of Exxon in their letter to Lynch, comparing it to ""cigarette companies that repeatedly denied harm from tobacco.""Since the LA Times and Inside Climate News reports were published, climate change advocates have criticized Exxon. Environmentalist Bill McKibben called the company's actions an ""unparalleled evil.""RL Miller, founder of Climate Hawks Vote, a super PAC that supports lawmakers pushing for action on climate change, praised Lieu and DeSaulnier's letter. ""Exxon’s malfeasance may constitute violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, the False Claims Act, or the Securities Exchange Act -- or all of the above,"" Miller said. ""The Obama administration needs to act without delay to stop Exxon’s climate criminality.”Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said the company ""unequivocally"" rejects the allegations. ""The media reports that are the basis for their allegations are inaccurate distortions of ExxonMobil’s more than 30-year history of climate research that was conducted in conjunction with the Department of Energy, academics and the UN International Panel on Climate Change,"" Jeffers said in an email. ""Suggestions that ExxonMobil suppressed its climate research are completely without merit.""Jeffers pointed to some 50 peer-reviewed papers that Exxon scientists contributed to on climate change and carbon dioxide's effect on the planet ""during the time when the media reports said we were suppressing climate science.""A recent blog post by Ken Cohen, Exxon's vice president of public and government affairs, said ""nothing could be further from the truth,"" referencing the allegations in the LA Times and Inside Climate News pieces.""It should surprise no one that we have remained committed to pursuing climate change research since that initial discovery,"" Cohen said."
3,ENTERTAINMENT,"Brie Larson On 'Room,' Finding Roles After 'United States Of Tara' And Vacationing With Amy Poehler",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brie-larson-room_us_562024c9e4b06462a13b7ad5,The adaptation of Emma Donoghue's novel opens this weekend.,2015-10-16,"Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson star in a scene from ""Room.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561443ff1600002d00038390.jpeg?cache=GEQkjCOQbF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Brie Larson spent so much time with the 8-year-old co-star who plays her son in ""Room"" that when they weren't together during the shoot, she ""felt incapable of not talking about 'Star Wars' and which animal would beat what in a battle."" That's among the many charming and insightful revelations Larson and her movie son, Jacob Tremblay, revealed at the Toronto Film Festival, where ""Room"" screened to critical kudos and walked away with the coveted People's Choice Award. A month later, ""Room"" is now opening in theaters, a mere stop along its path to potential Oscar glory. Larson is one of the front-runners for Best Actress, and there's a good shot the movie will walk away with a Best Picture nomination, as well. The Huffington Post sat down with Larson last week to discuss the movie, which is an adaptation of Emma Donoghue's acclaimed 2010 novel. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson (""Frank""), ""Room"" opens on a garden shed where Ma (Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Tremblay) have been held captive for years. Jack knows no life outside of what they call Room -- until Ma devises a plan to escape. It's an emotionally searing story that required a great deal of prep for Larson, who participated in a silent retreat, avoided extended sunlight to achieve the requisite paleness and worked with a trainer to lose weight and build muscle. Larson's star is on the rise as a result. But before we could get to the nitty-gritty of making ""Room,"" we had to ask about vacationing with a certain funny lady.First of all, please tell me about your vacation with Amy Poehler and that human pyramid you guys did.Oh! I mean, there’s not much to say about it. We were all on vacation together and simultaneously Amy Schumer was on her own vacation and we all saw her and were like, “I think we can respond real strong.” We were all very pleased by how it turned out. We thought it was so awesome. So we posted it and then I think we all went surfing. Something like that. And then by the time we came back, it was like on the front of IMDb and all these things. I had just gotten Twitter and Instagram. I’d only had it a week, so I had no idea about this whole world of people picking it up and it getting this other life outside of being on your little page. I was like, “Whoa!”Have you been surprised by the Twitter and Instagram worlds? No, not really. I had a MySpace back in the day, so it wasn’t a complete shock. It is a wild one, especially something like an Instagram where you can see the comments. It’s been around for five years or something, so I became friends with some of my friends and you can see five years’ worth of photos that I didn’t know about. It’s our own Akashic records. It’s pretty wild.When you first read for this movie, did you do a scene from inside or outside of Room? There's a different rawness to both halves.We did both. We did a couple of scenes that would take place inside and then we did the interview scene that’s at the end. I think it was four or five scenes altogether, most of them being in Room.There is a distinct shift in the second half of the movie. What sort of shift did you experience in making it, since most of it was shot sequentially?Yeah, we shot pretty much in chronological order. The shift for me was -- and I knew this going into it because I had spoken with a trauma specialist -- is that any of the traumas that were happening to Ma in Room weren’t going to be emotionally dealt with until she was at home and in a safe place because the brain does not have space to deal with it. I had assumed that we would have to put moments inside of Room of her suffering and experiencing pain from this experience, but a trauma specialist said, “Oh no, it wouldn’t happen there at all."" It’s shutting certain things down in order to cope with that situation to survive, so for me I knew that Room was probably going to be the easiest the movie was ever going to get for me. Everything outside of it was like the dial was getting turned up more and more each day. Because it involves a child suffering, some people might assume this movie is difficult to watch. I feel like I've heard people say they're not sure they can handle it. Of course you can handle it! It’s not a scary movie!I’ve also seen it described as a thriller, which I don’t agree with.I don’t agree with that. And I don’t agree with “harrowing” either. I find that to be a real downer. I think the thing to get across about it is, from my understanding of people’s experience of watching the movie, the tears that you may express when you're watching the film are not coming from a place of anguish or sadness or fear; it’s coming from the love for the movie. It’s coming from this bond between mother and child -- it’s so tender, and you feel that love and it’s overwhelming. It’s overwhelming how it exceeds and transcends beyond their circumstances. That’s why people are having the connection to it that they are; it’s not coming from a scary, fearful, worrisome place. This is not a movie that’s going to give you nightmares.Does a role like this bring you closer to your own mother? No, the only thing I spoke with my mom about personally was what it was like to carry a child and what it was like to give birth. That’s a physical thing that I have no knowledge of, so I wanted to know, from her perspective, what does that mentally and physically make you feel like and what happens when you have a child? What changes for you? What was her take? It was a lot of what I had read, actually, which is that something clicks in your brain where suddenly this child is a floating piece of yourself that you need to protect. That becomes No. 1 and everything else, including yourself, becomes secondary or less. So everything goes into caring for, protecting, nurturing and creating a safe space for that. It also becomes a time of reflection where suddenly you’re reliving the experience that your mom went through and there are moments of feeling deep love and connection to your mother because you realize what amazing things she did despite the circumstances, and there may also be moments where you feel resentment where you go, “I see that you didn’t do this for me and I’ll make sure I do it for my kid.” I imagine there was quite a bit of that happening inside Room because this is an even heightened situation where Ma has nothing but time to reflect. She’s basically trapped in this time capsule where she’s just constantly looking back on her life and relating to this child as she’s relating to her younger self. After seeing him speak at the movie's press conference in Toronto, I'm amazed what a professional Jacob seems like.He is.I know you hung out and played together before shooting, and surely that informed a lot of what we end up seeing on the screen. But this is a tough role for a youngster. You yell at him a good bit. Did you have to talk him down after doing those scenes?No, because he had done a couple of movies at that point and this is what he loves to do, so it’s fun for him. He finds it exciting and interesting and a cool experience to let loose and explore, so he never took it personally because he knew what we were doing. He wasn’t a kid who just happened to fall onto a movie set and didn’t know what was going on. To him, it was all great fun.In looking back at your career since “United States of Tara” ended, do you feel like you’ve had an easy time finding the types of roles you’ve wanted to step into? No, it’s never been easy, but that’s sort of the fun of it -- the finding it. When “United States of Tara” was over, it felt like that feeling of graduating high school and wondering which college you were going to. That was my home. That was my place with my people for three years of my life. I was there from 18 to 20, such an important time in my life and such a safe place where I was so loved and understood and nurtured. When that was done, I had to go back out into the world and find myself all over again, so it was such a great thing, in some ways. I still miss it, but it was a great opportunity for me to find myself again and not just stay in a safe place, but to go back out in the world and see what was there for me.People are banging the “Brie Larson is a star!” gong a lot right now.Oh, that’s a nice gong!Do you feel it? I think it’s gotten louder between “Short Term 12” and this.I mean, people tell me that, but I don’t think that’s a gong that I have the frequency to hear. I don’t think that’s my place to believe or know. I just want to keep telling good stories, but it sounds like a great gong. I love that gong! Keep banging that gong! I just didn’t know if I’m supposed to hear that gong.It goes back to our conversation about Twitter and Instagram and having a heightened awareness of those conversations.Yeah, and that’s why it becomes important to take it all with a grain of salt and know that nothing is good and nothing is bad -- it just is.""Room"" is now in theaters.Also on HuffPost:For a constant stream of entertainment news and discussion, follow HuffPost Entertainment on Viber."
4,CRIME,Dogs Recovering After Man Allegedly Beat Them With Sledgehammer,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bella-tupac-dogs-sledgehammer_us_56215a46e4b0bce34700b344,Authorities say the attacker's girlfriend asked him to euthanize the Labrador retrievers.,2015-10-16,Tupac (left) and Bella with veterinary technician Kristy Gomez.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56215b981400002a00c7a279.jpeg?cache=hrrnjaNcv1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two Labrador retrievers in Lakeland, Florida, are recovering after a man allegedly beat them in the heads with sledgehammers late last week.Tupac and Bella will likely remain at the SPCA of Florida’s veterinary hospital for a few more days before being transferred to foster care, SPCA marketing director Jessica Lawson told The Huffington Post Friday.Tad Whitworth, 49, is facing two counts of felony animal cruelty for allegedly beating Tupac and Bella. He's accused of attacking the dogs after his girlfriend, who owns them, asked him to euthanize them because she felt they were too old. Polk County deputies said witnesses saw Whitworth bludgeoning the animals' heads and bodies last Friday, according to the Orlando Sentinel.Lawson said the dogs seem well-adjusted, considering the ordeal they've been through. At first, Bella was growling a bit, but Lawson said her temperament has been steadily improving as her pain subsides.When Lawson visited with the dogs on Friday, Bella “was just sitting there loving on Kristy,” she said, referring to a veterinary technician at the hospital. “Her tail was wagging, which I hadn’t seen yesterday.”Once the dogs fully recover, which could be within a few weeks, the plan is to offer them up for adoption. ""I didn’t hear of any adopters yet, but hopefully once they’re all patched up someone extra-special will come forward,"" said Lawson. She noted that the SPCA is able to care for Bella and Tupac thanks to donations to the organization’s Guardian Angel Fund.“Obviously, this is certainly not a way to euthanize elderly pets,”Donna Wood, a public information officer at the Polk County Sheriff's Office, told local news station WPTV of Whitworth's alleged actions. She noted that animal control facilities are ""certainly here to help people with that type of situation. You do not take that into your own hands with a sledgehammer.”Wood added that the dogs were found covered in fleas, and it appeared no one had taken care of them for some time.Whitworth is still at large, according to Sam McGuirt of the sheriff's office. A Facebook post from the office describes Whitworth as 6’3” and 205 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.The sheriff's office did not have a representative immediately available to comment on whether the owner of the dogs would face charges.Authorities are offering a cash reward for information on Whitworth’s whereabouts, and instruct those who may have seen him to call 1-800-226-TIPS or visit www.heartlandcrimestoppers.com.Contact the author at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.com"

Trump, who has complained in the past about last month's three-hour debate on CNN, took aim at the next debate's TV sponsor on Twitter:The Trump-Carson letter, first published by NBC, surfaced as Politico reported how a Republican National Committee conference call the previous day had ""spiraled into chaos"" as campaign aides raised questions about the debate criteria.An RNC spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNBC did not comment specifically on Trump and Carson's letter, but in a statement, said the network's ""goal is to host the most substantive debate possible.""""Our practice in the past has been to forego opening statements to allow more time to address the critical issues that matter most to the American people,"" the statement read. ""We started a dialogue yesterday with all of the campaigns involved and we will certainly take the candidates’ views on the format into consideration as we finalize the debate structure.""Television executives surely don't want a Trump-less debate.

Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) presidential campaign on Thursday moved to push back against what it called a ""false narrative"" that his presidential bid is slowly going down in flames.In a memo issued to the press, senior adviser Doug Stafford and campaign manager Chip Englander argued that Paul's political operation, ground game, and the coming debates left him well-positioned heading into the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. The memo highlighted Paul's recent straw presidential poll victories, his teams of supporters on the ground in early states, and his efforts to woo student voters across campuses in Iowa.""Ground game and political organization have a disproportionate impact in primaries and especially caucuses,"" they wrote, adding that Paul ""has the best organization in America.""The memo comes in the wake of a decline in poll numbers, putting Paul at risk of not making the cut for the next Republican presidential debate, which will be held later this month in Boulder, Colorado.The Kentucky Republican said in an interview with CNN on Thursday that he was confident he would be on stage for the main debate. He also took issue with polls that used small sample sizes, sometimes as few as 200 people.""Like John McCain in 2008, Senator Paul's campaign isn't showing up in October polling, but will be there when it counts -- on Election Day,"" his aides added in the memo.Fundraising is posing a problem for Paul, as well. His campaign raised approximately $2.5 million over the last three months, with $2 million cash on hand. The haul is far less than that of some of his rivals, including Ben Carson, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and even former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.The campaign attempted to drum up some interest on Wednesday by live-streaming Paul's activities as he criss-crossed the state of Iowa. But the affair ended on a sour note when Paul himself complained about the ""dumbass"" live-stream with hundreds of viewers still watching.On Thursday morning, Red State's Erick Erickson made clear that he had had enough.""Rand Paul, this was an interesting run and I am a fan of yours,"" he wrote. ""But your campaign is a bloody embarrassment that needs to be taken out back and put out of its misery. Go home to Kentucky, Senator, and save your Senate seat before Kentucky’s voters take the incompetence of your Presidential campaign as a reflection on you and your Senate campaign."""

The rival American Journalism Review had become an online-only magazine in 2013, just two years before it ceased publication altogether.But Elizabeth Spayd, editor-in-chief and publisher of CJR, said her publication is merely shifting its strategy in light of the obvious changes in journalism.""When a publication cuts back on print, it usually triggers dire predictions that another shoe will drop,"" Spayd wrote in a note to readers. ""But there is no other shoe in CJR's case. Thanks to the dedication of our many supporters, we have growing resources.""In an interview with The Huffington Post, Spayd explained that readership of CJR's print product had declined in recent years -- to less than 10,000, under half of its heyday total -- and the print version was losing money. Meanwhile, traffic to CJR's website, which publishes reported analysis and commentary about the journalism industry, had increased by 35 percent in the previous year. Given those indicators, Spayd said it made sense to focus more resources where the readers were.""The overwhelming majority of our audience comes to us digitally,"" Spayd said. ""It didn't make sense to spend as much money as one needs to spend to put out a quality magazine with an audience that size; it limits how much we can do in the digital space.""CJR will be shifting staff over to the website and publishing online more frequently. ""That's what I am definitely excited about -- the feeling I can come to work every day and have a clear focus on this digital audience,"" Spayd said. The print magazine will become more of a premium product, she said, with ""a strong investigative bent in the mode of CJR as classic watchdog."" Spayd described the next iteration of the magazine as ""more high-concept"" with a greater focus on design and quality writing. The twice-a-year magazine -- which Spayd said will be thicker than the current product -- is paying ""top-market rates for our writers.""There is a downside to online publication: Print subscribers bring stability and a sense of loyalty that has proved harder to replicate online. As a nonprofit, CJR is supported by a core group of donors accustomed to receiving the magazine in the mail.

10,BUSINESS,This Is Why We Should Pay Attention To Bernie Sanders On Social Security,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/401k-retirement-savings_us_561fe891e4b050c6c4a4be38,"Because your 401(k) really might not be enough, a new report finds.",2015-10-15,Sen. Bernie Sanders thinks we really need to expand Social Security.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561ff14b1400006f003c85a2.jpeg?cache=te6W70waA4&ops=crop_70_70_2919_1579%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the past few decades, American companies have turned away from pensions and toward 401(k) accounts to help their workers save for retirement. That's been a terrible deal, according to a new analysis released Thursday. Senior citizens on average drew less than $1,000 from their 401(k)s and similar accounts last year, the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found when it looked at Census data. By comparison, seniors on average received $6,000 from traditional pensions.The terrifying reminder that many people are headed for their golden years with hardly enough money to afford cat food for dinner comes at a time when politicians -- well, mostly Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- are talking about Social Security expansion again.The amount seniors draw from their 401(k) accounts could edge up a little in the coming years, as the 401(k) generation heads into retirement. These plans started becoming popular in the 1980s.Still, there's little evidence that 401(k)s will be as significant a source of income for retirees as pensions were back in the day, said Monique Morrisey, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute who did the analysis. ""There's very little money in these things [401(k)s],"" she told HuffPost. ""Yes, they're gonna increase, but not enough.""The picture is bleakest for the bottom 60 percent of earners, as you can see. Social Security is the primary source of retirement income for middle- and lower-income Americans.""My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by -- and I don't know how they do on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year -- you don't cut Social Security, you expand it,"" Sanders said during Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate.Sanders is looking for an across-the-board increase in Social Security benefits. His chief rival, Hillary Clinton, declined to say during the debate if she supports a similar expansion, focusing her comments on improving the situation for women and children.  ""Bernie Sanders is onto something,"" Morrisey said.Progressive hero Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has also been pressing for an expansion, joined by other Democratic senators.Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is talking about scaling back benefits as part of his party's ongoing effort to cut government spending."

London-based company Mogees is now selling an eponymous device that lets you make music by scratching and tapping any surface it's attached to. The tool uses vibration sensors to capture different movements, and converts them into musical notes. Then, the Mogees iPhone app allows you to associate each movement with a different sound and use the result in other music apps, according to the BBC.Watch this man demonstrate how it all works by playing a door as if it were a full-sized drum set:Mogees' Kickstarter campaign surpassed its goal of $30,325 in just 29 hours, thanks to the company's promotional video. It's raked in almost $81,000 since then.The company released the first edition of the product in 2014, but has refined the sensory technology for a new generation of Mogees, according to its website. The new devices will be available after the Kickstarter campaign ends in November. This should make for some interesting live shows in the near future. "
12,MEDIA,Rush Limbaugh Dismisses Climate Warnings As 'Apocalyptic Doom',Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rush-limbaugh-global-warming_us_561ee59de4b0c5a1ce61fd03,"""I mean, you can make some cases, examples that some warming would actually be good for a lot of things and people.""",2015-10-15,Rush Limbaugh thinks climate change warnings are exaggerated.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561ee5b41400002a00c79fda.jpeg?ops=crop_0_551_3000_1922%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said Wednesday that warnings about the potential effects of climate change are overblown, arguing some global warming ""would actually be good for a lot of things and people."" The comments, highlighted by liberal watchdog Media Matters, came in response to Democratic presidential candidates pressing the urgency of climate change during Tuesday night's primary debate. Limbaugh took issue with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who said climate change is the country's greatest national security threat.""Here's Bernie Sanders last night going on and on and on about it, he was asked over and over again, number one biggest, most important, threatening issue we face. Climate change. 'If we don't act fast, our children and grandchildren may be faced with an uninhabitable planet,'"" Limbaugh said on his radio show. ""Nobody's even said that. I mean, you can make some cases, examples that some warming would actually be good for a lot of things and people.""It is scary that people believe this, but it's not unusual,"" Limbaugh said. ""Human beings have this propensity to believing, falling for every single apocalyptic doom that they are told is happening."" Limbaugh also criticized an ""utterly preposterous"" study that found continued greenhouse gas emissions would put many U.S. cities below sea level. ""It's just absurd, and it's all based on bogus, bohunk computer modeling. There's not one shred of scientific data,"" he said.Many climate scientists have warned about the dire consequences of ignoring man-made climate change. In 2010, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal said half of earth could be uninhabitable by 2300 if current emission trends continue. And in 2014, a United Nations panel of climate scientists warned that Earth is on an ""irreversible"" climate change course.""Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impact,"" the panel said.Also on HuffPost:"
