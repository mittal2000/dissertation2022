Sure, the idea isn't so bad -- getting to hang out with all of your old high school friends for one night -- but the actual reunion can be, well, just plain awkward. Hello, ""American Reunion."" After three feature films and a handful of dreadful straight-to-DVD movies, ""American Reunion"" is the last chapter of the ""American Pie"" franchise.Although the crew is back for their high school reunion, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, things haven't really changed. It's the same crude humor, the same sex and yes, the same Stifler (Seann William Scott). ""The entire film is a mistake,"" wrote critic Amy Biancolli. Meanwhile, the small screen isn't safe either, as NBC's ""Best Friends Forever"" and Starz's ""Magic City"" both fell flat with TV critics.HuffPost Entertainment has rounded up the week's snarkiest reviews just for your enjoyment in this week's installment of our ""Week In Ouch"" series.This week, critics from Entertainment Weekly to The New York Times and HuffPost TV were left shaking their heads and sharpening their critiques. Even PETA couldn't hold back their tongues when it came to Kanye West's new track, ""Theraflu."" Let us know which films, albums and TV shows you think deserved the harsh critiques, and which ones you think critics should ease up on in the comments."

A touch of green from the natural world is always a great way to freshen up things in your decor or on your table for that next dinner party or brunch! Here are a few moments of inspiration from a recent party that I thought might conjure up that spring design joy we are all looking for right now!Freshen up a place setting by adding a stem of rosemary or any fragrant herb. Add a simple table runner with a stripe of green as I did here. The natural linen tones and whitewashed wood of the table work perfectly with the fresh green tones.Take simple containers like this galvanized bucket and fill with a single type of flower or foliage. This green kale looks great but you could use hydrangea, lilac or even green chrysanthemums. Make simple little arrangements with spring blooms and little branches from a cherry tree or anything blooming in your own yard! Use recycled and vintage bottles and group in clusters with candlelight for a perfect, chic table accent. This would be great on a coffee table, bedside table or as a centerpiece. "
