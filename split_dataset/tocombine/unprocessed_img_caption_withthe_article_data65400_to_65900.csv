0,LATINO VOICES,Marc Anthony Slams Trump During New York City Concert,Tanisha Love Ramirez,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marc-anthony-trump_us_56b7ae88e4b01d80b246b3f4,The Puerto Rican singer's NSFW criticism brought the crowd to its feet.,2016-02-07,"He Called Latino Immigrants ""Criminals"" And ""Rapists""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e0e21714000077002e4580.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Marc Anthony has a few choice words for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The singer shouted “Fuck Donald Trump!” as he wrapped his nearly sold-out show at New York’s Madison Square Garden on Saturday.“I want him to hear it in his house. Wake that motherfucker up,” he continued, before launching into his final song.Anthony’s strong words about Trump came as he concluded an impassioned speech about Latino unity and pride.“I’m proud to be Latino in the United States of America,” Anthony said, looking around at the audience. “I see Peruvian flags, Uruguay. I see Panama. I see the Dominican Republic … Let me tell you something: We’re all proud of our culture.”Anthony said that though Latinos are not all alike -- they all speak a little differently, have their own customs and food -- they should stand united. “But here, no matter where you come from, we’re Latinos!” he said. “And we have to take care of each other. No matter where we come from.”After taking a brief pause to bask in the cheers from the crowd, Anthony cursed Trump, bringing the audience to their feet for a standing ovation.The singer has lashed out at Trump from the stage before. He denounced the billionaire in a similar fashion during a joint concert with Carlos Vives in Las Vegas in September.Trump has become a target for many Latino celebrities, politicians and activists since he made some harshly anti-immigrant comments while announcing his presidential candidacy on June 16. Watch Anthony’s speech in its entirety in the video above.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.H/T Latina.com Also on HuffPost:"

The crisis at FIFA is a crisis of leadership.,2016-02-07,"Syrian refugee children play soccer as others watch at the Zaatari refugee camp in Mafraq near the Syrian border in Jordan, Saturday, June 14, 2014. The soccer project, in conjunction with the World Cup in Brazil, was organized by the Asian Football Development Project, founded by Jordan's Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein, FIFA vice president, and the Union of European Football Associations. (AP Photo/Raad Adayleh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb78da52400005100570d64.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What will a new beginning mean for world football? It represents a chance to get things right, to set up FIFA as an organization dedicated to serving the game and the people who play it.Journalists have asked a great many questions during the presidential campaign, covering everything from regional concerns to the headline-grabbing troubles that have plagued the world governing body this last year.Invariably, they ask why I want to be the next president of FIFA. The answer is straightforward: It's about bringing good governance, transparency and accountability to the organisation.But in truth, that is only part of the answer. The complete picture is more complicated, and has much to do with my life's journey, which began 40 years ago in Jordan during a decade of oil crises and instability across the Middle East.My mother was lost in a helicopter crash in the country's capital, Amman, in 1977, little more than two years after my birth. So you will understand when I say that my father, King Hussein, played a significant role in my upbringing.He had a massive workload, but was never an aloof or distant figure in my life. His children mattered to him a great deal.He, too, was lost to my family on February 7, 1999, not long after my 24th birthday.My father was a great believer in education, but believe me when I tell you that no amount of schooling can prepare a young man for the question of how to honor a father's memory and legacy. Football can be a force for good across the globe. Jordan lies within arguably the most politically unstable region in the world. Throughout his reign of more than 45 years he was never afraid to tackle conflict, but built his international reputation around his relentless pursuit of peace and reconciliation right up until his death.Jordan was never blessed with the natural wealth enjoyed by many of its neighbors. It lacks fresh water, and good arable land is scarce. This was, and still is, a major challenge. But the nation built a future around its people and, while the ongoing regional turmoil has created major problems, Jordan continues to follow my father's guiding principles under King Abdullah. These are no minor achievements in a wider region wracked by bloodshed and civil war.My father had a disarming honesty and unwavering integrity. He built a future for his nation around his guiding principles. I saw him do it. We are not talking textbook theory here. His decisions affected lives and livelihoods, and I watched him lead Jordan through a geopolitical minefield.I am proud to say his principles have provided a roadmap for my own life. I share his tenacity and, like him, never give up.I have served my country, both militarily in its Special Forces and as director of the National Centre for Security and Crisis Management, as well as in other capacities. I have helped to build programmes to support the influx of Syrian refugees. Football has been a love of mine since childhood, and I have served the game for a good many years. I am passionate in my belief that football can be a force for good across the globe.In 2012 I founded the Asian Football Development Project to promote the game among the continent's young people. The project has extended the reach of football to some of the poorest communities in Asia. The salary from my four years on FIFA's executive committee went to support its work.So, when journalists ask why I want to be the next president of FIFA, I tell them it is about delivering good governance, transparency and accountability. But, for me, it is about so much more. A world of possibilities lies ahead. I see how great FIFA could be. ""FIFA must abandon its bunker mentality and open its doors to change."" I reject the notion that FIFA cannot be reformed from within. The crisis at FIFA is a crisis of leadership.This is all about the future. It is about making bold decisions and building an enduring organization that values and cares for its players, from the young boys and girls who kick a home-made ball around a rock-strewn, dusty pitch, to the game's professionals. It is about developing the game for the greater good, nurturing the youngsters who represent not only the future of football, but the future of FIFA.It is about supporting developing nations, ensuring that football becomes a global unifying force.FIFA must abandon its bunker mentality and open its doors to change. We are talking structural reform, a commercial overhaul, a renewed focus on development, a fresh focus on football.There is no room for cynicism. Football has the ability to change lives. It teaches self-discipline and the value of hard work. It encourages teamwork. It empowers youth. FIFA has a social responsibility to manage the game with dignity and honesty.The organization must be rebuilt to be deserving of respect.FIFA cannot change the past. Nor can it prevent repercussions from the turmoil of the past year. But that must not divert the organization from charting a fresh course.This is not the time to be playing politics with the future of FIFA. Its 400 diligent staff must be acknowledged and supported to be the best they can possibly be.Very simply, it is about improving what is right about FIFA and fixing what is wrong. It is time for the organisation to emerge from the shadows and make a fresh start."

I am going to reduce my mortgage by at least 50 percent;and, I am giving away lots of ""had to have"" items I probably never needed in the first place and definitely will not need going forward.Maybe this is related, come to think of it: I am at the stage of life where I am willing to wait for movies to make it to Netflix. I'm okay with road company tours of last year's Broadway shows. I see a book I want, I check the library first. (And then, if they don't have it, I allow myself to buy it. There is a limit.)""Why didn't we do this years ago?"" a friend asked recently. She is pursuing a similar downsizing plan.""Because we weren't ready,"" I said.She nodded. ""Yeah.""""We had all these ideas about our lives and what they would be and what we deserved because we work so hard and what it means to be a success and have the means to buy a lot of things,"" I said.She nodded. Then I nodded, too.She sighed. Then I sighed, too.And then I said, ""You know what? We have stopped needing abundance. Abundance is too much.""As soon as I said that I thought to myself, Whoa. Write that down. There's more there. Go deeper. Explore, Magellan. Set sail.So I'm cleaning my closets and drawers and getting the house ready to put on the market. While I straighten and declutter, I think about abundance.And this comes floating in.""Eat! Children are starving in Eastern Europe!""Maybe you remember that one? The order to consume greater amounts because less fortunate children had nothing but a few rotten potatoes.The idea was simple. Over-consume because you can. Over-spend and overdo because the flip side is too awful to contemplate and feels like failure. The more the better. Do whatever you need to do to stave off the big bad bogeyman of scarcity. Eat more, buy more, spend more, drink more, shop more.So the sign -- the mark -- of a successful person is more. Lots and lots more. Whoever has the greatest number of toys when they die...Or so that commandment suggests.But what if scarcity is not, in fact, the opposite of abundance? What if the actual opposite of abundance is sufficiency? The order would then become:Eat until you've had enough and give the rest of it to someone who does not have enough. Achieve balance.I believe this is what we Baby Boomers are starting to understand now. We are hitting our mid- or late 50s or early 60s, and some of us (many of us, hopefully) are waking up to the reality that we do not need abundance. That abundance does not, in fact, give meaning to our lives. That abundance (excluding abundance of love) means this and only this: The more stuff you have, the bigger the pain in the ass it is to move.And that brings me back to why 3,100 square feet for one person and a small Frenchie is abundant. And why I'm moving. And downsizing my life.Because there is mobility and freedom and a lightness in being when we lose our need for abundance and live in sufficiency. When we let go. When we let it all go. Or at least a good portion of it.The bearable, oh so bearable, lightness of being.Let's give a shout-out to David Bowie and Alan Rickman. Because they died within 48 hours of one another, they died fairly young, their deaths were a shock and their deaths made me stop in my tracks and say, Wow, time for some ch-ch-ch-changes. NOW.Scale it back. Size it down. Go smaller, leaner, more mobile, lighter, freer, more connected to love than to all the stuff. More attuned to the natural world. Better attuned to our bodies. Taking care of our bodies. Cherishing and nourishing them and trying to keep them healthy and hold the bad stuff at bay. To be more likely to dance, even it's very, very badly.I'm not aiming for an alms bowl here. Not stripping it back to poverty levels. Of course not.Also, I am very specifically and intentionally not romanticizing the lives of the poor -- the food insecure, the homeless, the destitute -- because theirs is a different and legitimately horrifying situation. And demands our empathy and our help.Downsizing my life is making me take stock of the situation. And ask -- about every item -- do I need this? Do I want this? If so, why? What would my life without this be like? How would I feel about myself if I didn't have this? How would I feel if I gave this away?How would it feel to dance, even very, very badly?That's what I'm becoming about now. Staring down the barrel at 60 (still three years away but, last I checked, three years go by in about 11 minutes...) and wanting way, way less. Just enough. Sufficient. Light.For the record, the French bulldog is not buying this strategic plan. He is about abundance. In love and in kibble. And that's okay with me. There will plenty of both in the smaller house. In fact, there will be an abundance.A version of this piece originally appeared in Midcentury Modern on Medium.Photo credit: The Chicago Art DepartmentEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

17,BLACK VOICES,Global Blackness and Diasporan Dopeness,"Luvvie Ajayi, ContributorAward-winning writer and digital strategist who thrives at the...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/global-blackness-and-diasporan-dopeness_b_9180678.html,"Diasporan dopeness won't let us quit. We are manifested from ancestral excellence and we cannot be outdone. Being conscious of Global Blackness is knowing that we are not an island of our struggle, but a nation of our triumphs. That's Blackness to me.",2016-02-07,2016-02-07-1454851240-172133-BlackFutures2016AlixaGarciaGlobalPerspectives1.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-02-07-1454851240-172133-BlackFutures2016AlixaGarciaGlobalPerspectives1.png,"I didn't growing up knowing I was Black or having to deal with the idea of Blackness because I was born and raised in Nigeria. In a country where ""Black"" is the default, it doesn't need to be defined or spoken about or made a topic of discussion. I knew I was Yoruba and Nigerian for the first 9 years of my life. I did not become conscious of my color and all that came with it until I moved to the United States with my family. It was my first time feeling that being born Black could be a liability. It was my awakening to doubt. It was my introduction to race as an influence. Through my school years, I learned more about slavery, anti-Black racism and oppression in the US, and my Blackness could no longer be an afterthought. I started wearing it proudly and as my consciousness deepened, so did my love for Black folks.Through the struggles, I see so much beauty, and the grace of melanin cannot be overstated. Plus, the work it does to keep us from cracking deserves all the praise. We stay looking 25 at 50 years old, thanks to the gods of moisturizer, shea butter and noir blessings! But most importantly, I am heartened by the connection of Black people everywhere. Being a global citizen and lover of travel has recently taken me to over 20 countries so far, and one thing that always moves me is how I see home all around me. You can go to Brazil and find natives speaking a language close to Yoruba. You can be in Ghana and see someone who looks like someone you know in Chicago. My Trinidadian friends can suck their teeth in a way that makes me think of my Mom doing the same. Some of my Black American friends look like my cousins, betrayed by those high cheekbones that won't quit. I can go to a club in Nigeria and listen to Hip Hop and R&B. The way we move, the foods we eat, and our power connects us, and I carry that with me and it finds me wherever I go.Similarly, our struggles are also parallel across the Black diaspora. As we hail #BlackLivesMatter in the United States, our skinfolks elsewhere are having to do the same, in different fights. I was in South Africa in September 2014 and I had to visit Nelson Mandela's house in Soweto. The system of apartheid there has countless parallels to Jim Crow in the United States, so that was an important site to learn and take it all in. However, my most notable moment happened when I went a few blocks down to visit the Hector Pieterson Museum. In 1976, South African students were protesting the new mandate that Afrikaans (a Dutch-based language) would be what they used to teach in school. Police came and shot in the crowd, killing 200 students and 13-year old Hector was one of the first people killed. He became the symbol for the injustice that happened there. In that museum, I was stunned when I stood in front of a picture where protesters held up signs that said ""Don't Shoot."" 40 years ago, on the other side of the world, Black people used the same phrase we used in Ferguson, after Michael Brown was killed. I was stunned. Across the globe, we have to fight to have our full dignity recognized and our humanity acknowledged. In that moment, I felt more connected to Blackness as a whole. Our struggles are interchangeable no matter what languages we speak or where we call home. #BlackLivesMatter here, and in Haiti, and in Sudan, and in Cuba, and everywhere.And we fight until we turn our trials into advancement. Why? Because Diasporan dopeness won't let us quit. We are manifested from ancestral excellence and we cannot be outdone. Being conscious of Global Blackness is knowing that we are not an island of our struggle, but a nation of our triumphs. That's Blackness to me.Illustration by Alixa GarciaThis post is part of the ""Black Future Month"" series produced by The Huffington Post and Black Lives Matter Network for Black History Month.

So why is it hosting the best game? It's all about rewarding teams with new stadiums, even if they aren't ready to host a Super Bowl.Earlier in the year, Baltimore Ravens Justin Tucker, one of the best in the league, sought to make a field goal. But he was, by all accounts, partly swallowed up by a sort of sinkhole in the middle of the field, missing his 3-pointer, of course. It was hardly the only play of the game where players slipped and slid on the field, affecting the outcome of the game.Levi's Stadium is regarded as the worst NFL field, as the 49ers football team that plays on it can't even get real practices in. They've had to continually resod the field. Practices have to be canceled while the stadium is fixed. But it's a new stadium, and that's all that matters.The National Football League can't wait to show off its new toys. As soon as a team starts talking about building a new stadium, they get to host the next Super Bowl, whether they are ready for it or not. Atlanta's new stadium is already being considered for a Super Bowl, even though it's still being built.Longtime stadiums that have proven their effectiveness are by-passed in favor of the latest model. You'll never see a Super Bowl at a place like Lambeau Field in Green Bay or Soldier Field in Chicago, even though they have none of the problems other stadiums have.Levi's Stadium was rushed in its construction, according to the site Sportsgrid. This accounts for the numerous problems. But it's hardly the only case of a poorly designed field thrown together that was rewarded with a Super Bowl, or even multiple Super Bowls.While Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie was building a new football stadium to replace the Orange Bowl in 1987, the NFL rushed to award the team the 1989 Super Bowl. During the game, the crappy field led to a gruesome injury to All-Pro Defensive Lineman Tim Krumrie, regarded as one of the worst sports injuries in history, on a routine play. He was never the same again. And neither was the stadium.The stadium was poorly designed, as fans are nearly twice as far away from the game as in other stadiums by one estimate, because it was built to accommodate soccer and baseball. It bakes the fans on both sides in early season games. It does not protect the fans from the elements. Many fans headed for the exits during one Miami Super Bowl, thanks to a tropical drenching.Top notch cold weather football towns like Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Denver and Washington, DC are denied the right to host a game, but nobody minds when torrential downpours mar games played in Florida (Miami and Jacksonville, also given a Super Bowl for upgrading their stadium).Houston is supposed to get the next Super Bowl (Super Bowl LI), even though their own mediocre field may be responsible for several injuries of key Houston Texans football players. But they have a brand-new field, so Houston ""has"" to get the game, according to the NFL.Now the Atlanta Falcons are building a new stadium. Even though they haven't finished construction, they are already lobbying to be a Super Bowl host, with tax dollar incentives hanging in the balance.If the Super Bowl wants a better product, with a better fan experience and fewer injuries or poor play on a sub-par stadium field, it should reward the cities with fields that have stood the test of time, and provide the best for fans. Stadiums shouldn't get the Super Bowl until they have demonstrated competence in field and fan quality first.John A. Tures is a professor of political science at LaGrange College in LaGrange, Ga.

Some will call you a radical for calling for justice for all. Some will take offense when we have to assert that our lives should indeed matter, just as much as anyone else’s. Some will call you the real racist for daring to call out racial inequality. But they know better. And we certainly know better.

Sheila Galbraith Bronfman, the coordinator of the group who started it in 1991, said she modeled it on a smaller group of Georgians who helped former President Jimmy Carter in early primary states and called themselves the Peanut Brigade. This year, all the Travelers are wearing buttons identifying themselves as part of this tight-knit group. The Clintons have deep ties in New Hampshire, and Hillary frequently reminds voters of that connection in her speeches.""It is impossible to express how grateful I feel for everything the people of this state have done for me and my family, for our country, over the years. ... Going all the way back to 1992, you opened your homes and your hearts to us. In 2008, you lifted me up and gave me back my voice,"" Clinton said in her 100 Club speech Friday night, referring to her win over Barack Obama in that Democratic primary.Clinton has been keeping a busy schedule in the final days before the primary on Tuesday, hoping to break into Sanders' lead in the polls."
24,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Pledges Not To Cut Social Security Benefits,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-pledges-not-to-cut-social-security_us_56b630dfe4b04f9b57d9d482,"Progressive groups applauded the move, but Sanders isn't as impressed.",2016-02-06,"Hillary Clinton vowed that she would not cut Social Security benefits on Friday, assuaging progressive groups that had demanded a definitive pledge.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b6316b1f00007f00217797.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton promised on Friday that she would not cut Social Security benefits, winning praise from progressive groups that had pressured her to take such a stance -- but drawing questions from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who challenged her commitment to the issue.""I won't cut Social Security,"" Clinton wrote in an initialed tweet that included a link to her campaign website’s Social Security page. ""As always, I'll defend it, & I'll expand it. Enough false innuendos.""The post was a response to something Sanders had tweeted earlier in the day, when he urged Clinton to ""join me in saying loudly and clearly that we will never cut Social Security.""But Clinton’s pledge clearly was also aimed at national progressive groups that publicly had demanded greater clarity from the presidential hopeful on the matter. Earlier on Friday, Social Security Works and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, neither of which have endorsed a candidate in the Democratic race, expressed dissatisfaction with language on the Clinton campaign website and with a campaign aide’s assurances that Clinton had ""no plans to cut Social Security, and in fact, has a plan to expand benefits."" The groups argued that this left leeway for her to agree to certain benefit cuts.Clinton previously had stated that she planned to increase benefits, particularly for vulnerable beneficiaries, but progressive groups worried she might be willing to strike a so-called grand bargain on fiscal policy that increased benefits for some poorer Americans as it cut middle-class benefits.Those organizations praised Clinton’s Twitter comment as the kind of airtight commitment they were seeking.""Today, Hillary Clinton clarified her position that she, like Bernie Sanders, will oppose all Social Security benefits cuts, including, of course, raising the retirement age which is an across the board benefit cut,"" said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works. ""Expanding, not cutting, Social Security is profoundly wise policy and what an overwhelming majority of Americans want.""The PCCC said members of its group and Social Security Works had helped secure Clinton's declaration by pressing the candidate to clarify her stance. The organization, which claims it has 1 million members, had been collecting signatures online from people wanting Clinton to rule out any Social Security benefit cuts, and had announced an advertising campaign asking Clinton to do the same.""This is a huge victory for American seniors,"" said PCCC co-founder Stephanie Taylor. ""Today, after thousands of Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Social Security Works members took action -- Hillary Clinton took cuts to Social Security off the table. Now, we can finally move to the conversation we should be having in a Democratic primary: how to best expand Social Security.""Democracy for America, an online progressive heavyweight that has endorsed Sanders in the primary, also praised Clinton’s Twitter pledge. The group, which claims over 1 million members, had used Twitter in the past to ask Clinton to rule out Social Security cuts -- and took to the medium again on Friday night to thank her for doing so.Sanders, however, was less sanguine in his reaction. He demanded more details from the Clinton campaign about its plans for the popular social insurance program.""We’re glad that, for the first time, Secretary Clinton has indicated that she will join me in expanding Social Security benefits,"" Sanders said in a statement, not acknowledging that Clinton previously had professed support for expanding benefits. ""But we need more clarity.""Sanders went on to list a series of policy options he believes will fix the program -- ones that he has embraced but that Clinton apparently has yet to adopt -- including lifting the cap on earnings that are subject to Social Security payroll taxes. ""Is she prepared to scrap the cap on payroll taxes?"" Sanders asked. ""Is she prepared to support legislation that I have offered that would both expand Social Security benefits and extend the solvency of Social Security for the next 58 years as a result of lifting the cap on taxable income on people who earn more than $250,000 a year? I hope so but we’re still not sure.""In fact, Clinton has expressed openness to lifting the cap on her website and on the campaign trail.""Hillary understands that there is no way to accomplish that goal without asking the highest-income Americans to pay more, including options to tax some of their income above the current Social Security cap, and taxing some of their income not currently taken into account by the Social Security system,"" her site states.Currently, the payroll taxes that fund Social Security are only levied on the first $118,500 of an individual’s earnings. Sanders has introduced legislation that would eliminate the cap on earnings of $250,000 or more, in order to both increase Social Security benefits across the board and prolong the program’s solvency. Clinton's website says she would ""preserve Social Security for decades to come by asking the wealthiest to contribute more"" and ""oppose closing the long-term shortfall on the backs of the middle class, whether through benefit cuts or tax increases.""The dispute over Social Security is the latest battle in an ongoing war over which of the two Democratic candidates is the most progressive -- a topic that dominated Thursday night's primary debate.Expanding Social Security has become a progressive litmus test in recent years, with prominent national figures like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) -- and mainstream liberal opinion leaders like The New York Times editorial board -- characterizing it as the appropriate response to an impending retirement income deficit. It remains to be seen whether Sanders’ attempts to cast doubt on Clinton’s position on Social Security will solidify his considerable lead in New Hampshire ahead of the state's primary on Tuesday. The senator, whose native Vermont borders the Granite State, has the backing of 56.9 percent of New Hampshire Democrats, compared with 37.6 percent for Clinton, according to HuffPost Pollster’s latest polling average."

And in the days and weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, word swept through San Francisco that the city’s police have indeed been relocating homeless residents.“The Super Bowl ended up being this lightning rod for people who were seeing all this money being thrown around and then people suffering on the streets ... and getting really frustrated with that,” said Jennifer Friedenbach, the executive director of the San Francisco-based Coalition on Homelessness, which helped organize a protest march on Wednesday. “That was what the protests came out of.”San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee has disputed claims that police are pushing the homeless out, countering that they have provided “alternatives” after opening additional shelter spaces. But while homeless advocates say there is no definitive proof the city is sweeping the streets to remove unwanted residents, there is enough anecdotal evidence to at least make homeless people feel they are being targeted.“We’re hearing over and over again that they feel like the police presence has increased and that they’re being told to move,” Friedenbach said. “It’s frequently being mentioned to folks that it’s because of the Super Bowl that they need to move. … From homeless people’s perspective, they feel like they are being displaced because of the Super Bowl.”The protests, which involved homeless San Franciscans, advocacy group leaders and residents who oppose the city’s handling of the issue, are in part an outgrowth of the circumstances around the Super Bowl, and the fact that it will cost San Francisco taxpayers nearly $5 million in city funds.Lawmakers and advocates including Friedenbach say the money spent celebrating the NFL could be better used to fight homelessness, especially as rapidly rising housing prices put an increasing number of San Franciscans in precarious financial situations. There are 8,000 homeless households waiting for space in public housing to open up and just one shelter bed for every six of the city’s homeless residents, according to the Coalition. The latest survey of the city's homeless, meanwhile, found that the number of homeless people increased by 3.8 percent in 2014, and that the amount of elderly and sick people without homes has grown, too. There are also more than 1,400 young adults aged 18 to 24 living on the city's streets.The money San Francisco is spending on Super Bowl City could cover a year of housing subsidies for 500 homeless people, Friedenbach said, or go toward subsidies to keep those at risk of becoming homeless -- particularly low-income senior citizens -- from losing their homes. It would be enough to fund two additional “navigation centers,” a pilot program that the city has used to help the homeless, she said.Unlike Santa Clara, San Francisco city leaders did not secure a contract with the Super Bowl host committee to ensure the costs of providing extra law enforcement and other public services would be reimbursed, so it is paying the bills for a celebration of a private company -- in this case, the NFL -- whose own annual revenues outpace the city’s budget. To lawmakers like Jane Kim, who sits on San Francisco’s board of supervisors, that’s a poor reflection of the city’s priorities.“We're seeing an economic divide that is unprecedented in this city,” Kim said. ""A lot of folks feel like if you're not super wealthy, you can't afford to live in San Francisco. And they expect that we should be using taxpayer dollars to solve these important issues...not to provide a party for some of the wealthiest people in the world.”“The NFL should pay for their own party,” she added.Super Bowl backers, including Lee, say the celebration will bring enough revenues to cover San Francisco’s costs, but Kim and many residents are skeptical -- especially after the city emerged as a financial loser from hosting the America’s Cup sailing tournament in 2014 and because other recent Super Bowl hosts have finished in the red.But the problems around homelessness go beyond the short-term impact of temporary relocations and immediate cost-benefit analyses. It’s irrelevant if there are “special sweeps” to remove the homeless from certain parts of the city for the Super Bowl, Friedenbach said, because it’s clear that the normal criminalization of homelessness in San Francisco has persisted around the event -- and will continue once the celebration is over.“What we know is that homeless people are heavily criminalized in San Francisco,” Friedenbach said. “They have been before the Super Bowl, and they will continue to be criminalized after the Super Bowl unless something serious changes.”San Francisco has more anti-homelessness laws than any other California city, Friedenbach said, and it issued more than 11,000 citations to homeless residents merely for resting in public spaces last year, according to the Coalition.Three-quarters of respondents to a Coalition homelessness survey last year said that law enforcement officers had approached them, while 70 percent said police had forced them to leave a public space. More than half said officers had searched them in the past year. And the number of citations issued for homelessness is on the rise: the city’s park service issued six times as many citations for homelessness in 2014 as they did in 2011, and police citations increased three times from 2011 to 2013, according to the Coalition’s data. The targeting also disproportionately affected minority and transgender people, the survey found.Other protests, organized and otherwise, have emerged across the city as well. San Franciscans have repeatedly toppled the gold-plated “50” statues that were placed around the city to commemorate the Super Bowl’s golden anniversary, and thousands of Uber drivers, upset with fare cuts that they say have left many of them earning less than the minimum wage, have threatened to “shut down” local highways on Super Bowl Sunday. Other cities have weathered protests during Super Bowl week before. But none of the concerns around the Super Bowl have resonated quite like homelessness. The Coalition has received an outpouring of support and offers to help in the past week, Friedenbach said, while city residents have stepped up in their own ways too: some have donated tents to homeless residents, while others volunteered to help the Coalition to help it set up a web site, NotSoSuperSF.org, to draw attention to their cause.These problems are not unique to San Francisco, particularly in the context of prioritizing public spending on NFL teams and venues over addressing homelessness. A formerly homeless man in St. Louis, for instance, filed a lawsuit against the city in 2014 as it tried to devote hundreds of millions of dollars to a new stadium for the St. Louis Rams (who eventually moved to Los Angeles), arguing that the city should put the funds toward homelessness initiatives instead. But the issues have received more attention in San Francisco, perhaps because it ""has really been at the forefront of the criminalization that's happening against homeless people,"" Friedenbach said.""And it's supposed to be such a liberal city, so there's a juxtaposition there that is really interesting to a lot of people,"" she said.There are signs that public officials have taken notice. Friedenbach said she and the Coalition are scheduled to meet with Lee on Tuesday to discuss ways to improve the city’s treatment of the homeless. They are also backing laws in the state legislature that would change the enforcement of anti-homelessness laws“If they had the political will to create a sustained revenue source for addressing homelessness in San Francisco, they could do it,” Friedenbach said.Kim, meanwhile, is pushing for a new city-wide ordinance that aims to ensure there isn’t a repeat of Super Bowl City, where San Francisco hands over millions of city funds without a close examination of what it is getting in return. When it comes to the Super Bowl, it is likely too late to renegotiate the city’s deal to get the NFL or Host Committee to reimburse San Francisco’s costs. But Kim and others argue it should be cause to re-examine how the city approaches future events.“The debate that we're having right now,” she said, “is, what is the appropriate way to invest taxpayer dollars back in the city? I hear it over and over again from our residents, they want us to spend our dollars on affordability, on homelessness, on mental health services...not on a party for the rich.”“Let's acknowledge that it's wrong, and let's try to fix it,” Kim said. “And if we can't do it for this event, certainly for the future.” Also on HuffPost:"

Some voters are eager to hear where she stands on the matter of Bernie vs. Hillary.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_100_5858_3135%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Betsy Burtis, 52, is one of the most sought-after people in the country this week: She's an undecided voter in New Hampshire.""I think Bernie speaks to my heart, and Hillary speaks to my head,"" the Derry resident told The Huffington Post Wednesday after a CNN town hall forum featuring Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Burtis didn't think she'd have to go through all this. She was a volunteer for Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's presidential campaign, until he dropped out after the Iowa caucuses. Burtis said if O'Malley were to endorse either former Secretary of State Clinton, or independent Vermont Sen. Sanders, that wouldn't really make a difference in her decision. But there is one person's backing that would: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).""It would make a difference. ... I was really hoping she would run this time,"" Burtis said, adding that she wanted to see Warren become the first female president. Warren, of course, isn't running. She resisted a loud effort to draft her into the race, repeatedly insisting she had no interest in the Oval Office. Although she also hasn't endorsed anyone yet, she is a constant presence in the race. Without Warren, Sanders likely would not be the phenomenon he is now. His entire candidacy is based on exploiting an intra-party rift that Warren opened up by talking about Wall Street after the crash. By making corporate accountability a top issue for the party and highlighting the ways Democrats in Washington weren't taking it seriously, she helped create the coalition that is now backing Sanders. Sanders' primary message is that big money and corporate interests have tilted the economy and political system against regular people. It's a theme that Warren has long made her trademark, as Sanders readily points out. ""When I talk about our economy, I use the term a 'rigged economy.' People like Elizabeth Warren and I use that term,"" Sanders said Friday at a ""Politics and Eggs"" breakfast forum in Manchester.Sanders also invoked Warren during Thursday night's Democratic debate when responding to Clinton's resistance to restoring the banking law known as Glass-Steagall. ""Folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it's Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation,"" Sanders said. But Clinton, too, has tried to associate herself with the Massachusetts senator. On Thursday, Clinton retweeted Warren's criticism of a House GOP bill making it harder for the federal government to go after financial crimes. Warren and Clinton's ties actually go back to the 1998, when Clinton read an opinion piece by Warren, who was then a professor at Harvard Law School. She was interested in Warren's arguments against a bankruptcy reform bill before Congress, which was being heavily pushed by credit card companies. Clinton met with Warren, who walked away impressed. The first lady then went back to the White House and persuaded her husband to veto the bill. ""She turned around a whole administration on the subject of bankruptcy. She got it,"" Warren told PBS host Bill Moyers in a 2004 interview. Clinton, however, then voted in favor of bankruptcy reform when she was a senator in 2001. She said the provisions she was most concerned about, which she had discussed with Warren, had been removed.A Warren endorsement would be a nice boost to either candidate, especially with the debate focused upon what it means to be a progressive. Warren's progressive credentials are unquestioned, and she remains incredibly popular with the Democratic base. ""I wouldn't say so much that we've reached out, but I know Sen. Sanders speaks to Sen. Warren. They're colleagues, they've chatted,"" Sanders senior adviser Tad Devine told The Huffington Post on Thursday. ""But it's not so much that we're kind of leaning on her or anything. We'd love to have her support and the support of others in the Democratic Party, but that's her decision with what she does about it.""The Clinton campaign didn't return a request for comment.Although endorsing Sanders may seem like a natural fit, Warren is facing pressure from her fellow Democratic senators to back Clinton. She is the only Democratic woman in the Senate who has not publicly endorsed Clinton -- several of them came up to New Hampshire to campaign for her in the final days before the primaries -- and some of her colleagues told The Hill that they've been talking to her about joining them. ""I've told Sen. Warren that we would welcome her anytime she's ready,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.). Warren, for her part, has been sticking to her core issues -- no doubt getting a boost because of the focus from the presidential race, and in turn fueling activist pressure on the candidates themselves to address the issues. This week, she delivered a scorching speech from the Senate floor, calling the criminal justice system ""rigged"" and going after the House GOP bill on financial crimes. It followed a report released by her office documenting 20 cases in which federal officials had enough evidence against corporate malfeasance to issue fines -- but a corporate offender went to jail in only one case.And on Tuesday, she delivered a big speech -- it already has more than half a million views on Facebook -- against the Trans Pacific Partnership Trade Deal that both Clinton and Sanders oppose. (Clinton came out much later against the deal, under significant pressure from activists to do so.) With the success of Sanders and his populist message, some Democrats are still wondering what would have happened if Warren had run -- even if they are happy with the current primary field. ""She would have had my vote 100 percent,"" said Courtney Kuketz, 29, a Massachusetts resident who attended the CNN town hall in Derry Wednesday and is backing Clinton. ""She has stood by everything she's ever said, and she's done it. That's why if she had run, she would have had my support.""Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) told The Huffington Post Friday that he thinks another progressive candidate, such as Warren, could have been a strong contender as well this cycle. Grijalva is one of just two lawmakers who have endorsed Sanders. ""Bernie stepped up,"" he added. ""He's it now, and I think he's galvanized around ideas. ... I'm happy Bernie's in it.""""The good news here is that we have a very rich bench,"" added Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a Clinton supporter.

Clarke identified as a man, but he was known publicly by his birth name, Danielle Jacobs, at the time of the footage.Mesa police officers showed up at his apartment after receiving multiple calls indicating he may be suicidal around 11 a.m. Thursday. Heather Allen -- president of HALO Animal Rescue, where Clarke previously volunteered and adopted Samson -- told AZ Family that she called police and asked officers to check on him after he sent her some concerning emails. Allen said she was told law enforcement was already on the way there. Detective Esteban Flores said that officers -- who were not wearing body cameras -- fired after Clarke came towards them holding a knife. “When [he] made contact with them [he] approached them with the knife, extended it out, and they felt threatened,"" Flores told AZ Family.Clarke was taken to a hospital and died of his injuries.His mother, identified only as Stacia, condemned the shooting in an interview with the New York Daily News.“Before the police arrived [he] wasn’t posing a threat to the community at all,” she said. “And the police came into [his] own place. They shot and killed a 24-year-old autistic, mentally ill individual whom they had been familiar with and aware of [his] special needs.”Samson, Clarke’s well-known dog, is now in the care of his family.Clarke posted a YouTube video in December expressing how ""ecstatic"" he was to learn that his insurance would pay 100 percent of his gender reassignment surgery. He also said that Arizona had the “worst mental health system across the United States” in a January YouTube video, and noted that he had received “practically no support.”"

Today, we speak with author Ben Rawlence about the refugee crisis and his work in Kenya's Dadaab camp.The European refugee crisis is just one part of a larger crisis playing out along borders and in camps across the world.A record 60 million people worldwide are currently forcibly displaced from their homes. Among them, 14 million have already spent five or more years as refugees -- what the United Nations classifies as “protracted displacement.” Many eke out a life in refugee camps, and most do not have the right to work or move around freely.This is the situation that confronts residents of Dadaab, the largest refugee camp in the world. The United Nations set up Dadaab in the dusty Kenyan desert in 1991 for 90,000 refugees escaping Somalia’s civil war. The camp is now home to over 350,000 people who live in a space of less than 50 square kilometers, according to the U.N. -- roughly as if the entire population of Cleveland, Ohio, were forced to live in an area smaller than the Ohio State University campus. Kenyan authorities claim the camp harbors members of the Somali militant group al Shabaab, and repeatedly threaten to shut it down.Ben Rawlence first went to Dadaab as a researcher for Human Rights Watch in 2010 and ended up writing a book that follows the lives of nine camp residents, including a former child soldier and a journalist who was born blind and recovered his sight. City of Thorns, published last month, details their determination to survive and longing to be resettled elsewhere. The WorldPost spoke to Rawlence about Dadaab and how it can help us understand the global refugee crisis.How did Dadaab become the world’s largest refugee camp?Initially, 90,000 people came in 1991, and then successive waves of conflict and famine in Somalia have driven many more people to the camp. People have also come from other countries, like Sudan and Ethiopia. Under Kenya’s encampment policy, the country tries to push all its refugees into camps. And of course, the residents of the camp have reproduced. The second reason is that, once upon a time, people used to go to refugee camps and then they would go home when there was peace. If they were there for a very long time, then the international community would resettle them somewhere else. But that international pipeline is blocked because rich countries are not taking so many refugees any more, which means that people are stuck. That’s the biggest reason why Dadaab is still growing.What did the people you met in the camp teach you about the experience of being a refugee?I’m mostly in awe of them -- that they manage to find hope somewhere in the threadbare horizon that they confront; that they manage to make a life for themselves despite all of these difficulties. Looking at their situation, I feel like I would either want to instigate some kind of revolution in the camp, or else I would give up and commit suicide. But somehow, they manage to keep going and I’m hugely impressed and humbled by what they’re able to do.What did the people you profiled think about the book?I read the stories I had written in the book to the people concerned, and we had a good laugh and a good conversation about what they thought. We’re all friends on Facebook, and they’ve all received copies of the book. They’re watching the coverage since it was published and the interviews that I post on Facebook.They’re very happy with the fact that the world is paying attention to Dadaab. The reason they talked to me is because they feel forgotten about. They want to be heard, they want to have their stories recorded, and they want their lives to be imbued with some meaning. For example, both the mother and father of Tawane [one of the main characters in the book] died this year. I had interviewed them and set their stories down in this book, and that’s quite a fitting tribute to them. As the world grapples with a refugee crisis of historic proportions that has even reached Europe’s shores, what do you hope people will take from the book?I tried to get behind the statistics and the general images, and give this crisis a human face. I want everybody who thinks they have a view about refugees to read this book, and to be reminded -- because we need to be reminded every day -- that these people are just like us, with wives and husbands and fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers, and they deserve to be looked after.I also tried to show the intractable politics of the situation which keeps everyone stuck in Dadaab. Unfortunately, I think that Dadaab and other temporary camps are going to become a permanent feature of our landscape.I have such little hope that nations are going to be able to agree on how to properly look after these people. Hopefully, if there are enough reminders that these people are humans like us, we can find the resources and political will to at least make that life a little bit dignified and a little bit humane.Your book describes the devastating famine in Somalia in 2011 and the delayed response of the international community. How did this episode shape your understanding of how international aid works?I’ve been working in the region for 20 years, so it was no surprise to me that the response was so delayed, and so media-driven. I’ve seen international responses rolled out in many different countries over the years, and the similarities of what happens every time is profoundly depressing. Lessons are never learned.We need to depoliticize aid, to commit much larger funds to international institutions and to let them make the decisions about when emergency assistance needs to deployed -- rather than the current process of crisis appeals, which is not driven by technical information but by political pressure on the rich nations.You discuss how media-driven the response to the famine was. How did you feel about that, given your own role as a storyteller?I tried to give a different story. The whole media circus was premised on the idea of the stereotype -- a typical, biblical African famine that everybody wanted to photograph. What was interesting to me was actually not that image at all, but the obverse of that -- to see the international media circus from the perspective of people in the camp.You write about your frustration that to Kenya and the rest of the world, people living in Dadaab are either invisible or seen as potential al Shabaab recruits and therefore, a security threat. How do people in the camp feel about al Shabaab?It’s very frustrating that the whole conversation about the camp and about refugees is always seen through the lens of terrorism. It’s very damaging, both to the refugees themselves and to the West, because it means we can’t see these other cultures and societies in all of their glory and their nuance. We’re only looking at whether or not these people are radicalized.Hopefully, once you finish the book, you won’t be able to sustain the fiction anymore that the camp is a hotbed of extremism. Extremism is such a sideshow -- it has no real relationship to the daily lives of these people, apart from the ways that it inspires such knee-jerk overreactions in Kenya and in the West. Yes, there are some extremists around sometimes, but that’s no more true there than in London or Nairobi or Boston. So the camp should not be defined by that.The people in the camp are very, very annoyed about that characterization of where they live. It’s a large community of people who have known each other for years, like a big village where people leave their doors unlocked.What has been the impact of Kenya’s heavy-handed anti-terror tactics on the camp?The refugees are already a defeated people. They feel if they stand up for themselves against Kenya’s crackdowns, that they’re going to have their food denied or they’re going to be sent back to a war zone, so the onus is on them to shut up and put up with it. So there are few repercussions for Kenya, beyond corroding Kenya’s image among Somalis and human rights organizations. This is why it keeps happening, because there’s no one to stop Kenya and say: ""It’s actually in your interest to look after these people. Here’s a bunch of well-educated, middle-class Somalis, who’ve been educated on the U.N. dime, who are allies in bringing peace to Somalia, and yet you’re trying to demonize them and treat them all like terrorists.""Extremism is a mental health issue. The societies that deal with it best are the ones that are inclusive, better at integrating people, and that don’t wage foreign wars. There’s an awful lot Kenya could do to counter radicalization. The issue is not radicalization among the refugee population, it’s radicalization among its own population, including both Muslims and Christians. For a budding young anarchist or nationalist in Kenya, the expression of their radical politics frequently takes a religious form because the democratic arena has been nullified and cheapened. They don’t have any hope in the democratic system, so they place their hopes in a religious future. So it’s not about refugees, but Kenya is trying to make it about refugees because they don’t want to face the harsh truth. This interview was conducted on Jan. 29 and has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Russia's intervention has tipped the balance of the war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad, reversing gains the rebels made last year.Any hopes of a ceasefire were dampened by Assad's foreign minister, who said it would be all but impossible to stop the fighting while rebels were able to pass freely across the borders with Turkey and Jordan.Taking full control of Aleppo, Syria's largest city before the civil war erupted five years ago, would be a huge strategic prize for Assad's government in a conflict that has killed at least 250,000 people and driven 11 million from their homes.Advances by the Syrian army and allied militias, including Iranian fighters, are threatening to cut off rebel-held zones of the city, still home to around 350,000 people, while more than a million live in government-controlled areas.Mevlut Cavusoglu, foreign minister of Turkey, which has already taken in 2.5 million Syrians, said up to 55,000 were now fleeing to the frontier.Cavusoglu said the border was open, but at the Oncupinar crossing near the Turkish city of Kilis, which has been largely shut for nearly a year, refugees were being shepherded into camps on the Syrian side.SHELLING AND AMBULANCESThe local governor, Suleyman Tapsiz, said around 35,000 Syrians had reached Oncupinar in the space of 48 hours.""Our doors are not closed, but at the moment there is no need to host such people inside our borders,"" he said.A Reuters reporter at Oncupinar could hear occasional shelling and saw several Turkish ambulances cross the border. Meanwhile, on the Turkish side, dozens of Syrian refugees who had already made it to Turkey queued up to beg the authorities to allow their relatives in, or to cross the border in the hope of bringing them back.Sitting in his car with his four children just inside Turkey, Ahmet Sadul, 43, was hoping to get back into Syria to look for relatives from his hometown of Azaz.""Now there are thousands of people from Azaz all waiting on the other side. They escaped from the Russians. I want to go and get my relatives. They are bombing Syrians all the time.""""Many people have left Aleppo. But still there are many civilians there. If Russia is successful, we are all dead.""Russia denies targeting civilians and says its actions are aimed at shoring up Syria's legitimate government and combating terrorism. The West and Turkey, which want Assad to step down, accuse Moscow of using indiscriminate force.But Syria has been emboldened by Russia's intervention. Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem told a news conference on Saturday that Damascus would resist anyone who launched a ground incursion into its territory.""Those (who do so) will return to their countries in coffins,"" he said, adding that no ceasefire would be possible unless borders were sealed.The commments appeared to be aimed at Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, which said this week they were ready to participate in any ground operations in Syria that the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq decided to mount.(Writing by David Dolan and Lisa Barrington; Editing by Kevin Liffey)"

""Supporting Assad is a mistake. He's the reason that ISIS exists in the beginning.

I’m happy to have a respectful conversation.“Now, your question begins with a false premise,” Cruz said to Davenport. “You asked me if I’m supporting Assad. I’m not supporting Assad.”Cruz' standing in New Hampshire has slumped this month, according to HuffPost Pollster's aggregation of all available polls, putting him in third place in the GOP race in the final days before the primary.The hostile exchange went back and forth for more than 10 minutes. As Davenport tried to elaborate, Cruz raised his voice and said sharply: “Sir, I’m happy to answer your question, but we are not having a debate.”Cruz said President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led the 2011 NATO effort to topple Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, claiming the intervention created a vacuum that allowed the rise of radical Islamic terrorists. He suggested the same thing would happen in Syria if the U.S. ousted Assad.Davenport passionately explained that Assad had killed 200,000 innocent Syrians. Cruz cut him off.“We will not have a debate, Sir. I will answer it, but I will not have a yelling match,” Cruz said forcefully, as Davenport again tried to get a word in. “Alright, this answer is over,” Cruz shouted as the crowd erupted in applause.Davenport, 49, admitted his passion got the best of him.“People are mad at me because I sounded angry tonight,” Davenport said later. “I wasn’t yelling obscenities. I’ll say for the record, there’s nothing more obscene in this world than hearing a politician support genocide. I got too angry because I care so much.”Davenport said Cruz' answer contradicted statements he had made in the past.“He said he doesn’t support Assad, but he wouldn’t take any actions to remove him from power,” Davenport said. “That’s basically putting him in alliance with Putin.”Davenport, who said he considers himself a moderate independent, said other presidential candidates have views on Syria he finds more appealing. “Marco Rubio does seem to take the right line on Assad, at least pretty close to it for that matter,” Davenport said. “So does Hillary Clinton, but not Bernie Sanders.”With foreign policy playing a major role in the 2016 election, Davenport said that Cruz, along with other candidates, are overlooking Assad’s role in ISIS recruitment of Sunni fighters.“Senator Cruz talks about attacking the root their ideology by keeping in place the very thing that fuels them,” Davenport said. ""I don’t get why American politicians don’t understand that.”Davenport acknowledged his exchange with Cruz caused quite a scene, but said he’ll continue to question presidential candidates on the topic to inform voters.“I do care very much about fundamental human rights and genocide,” Davenport explained. “I don’t want to see any American politician ever coming close to accepting that as a reality, let alone saying how Christian they are in the process.”Also on HuffPost:"
36,POLITICS,How Real Is 'Marcomentum'?,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-marcomentum_us_56b540b6e4b04f9b57d9c5b6,A personal investigation.,2016-02-06,The campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has been pushing the narrative that Rubio is picking up momentum in New Hampshire from voters who want to back an eventual winner.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b5413c1a00009c01ab21fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DERRY, N.H. -- Admittedly, a Jeb Bush town hall and a Chris Christie restaurant visit are bad places to look for Marco Rubio voters.And yet there I was, practically begging New Hampshire voters to tell me they had been leaning toward one of those GOP establishment candidates, but were now lining up behind Rubio to take down Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.“What do you make of the argument that establishment Republicans need to get behind Rubio because he’s the only one who can beat Trump?” I asked, over and over, in some form or another, feeling as if the Rubio campaign should probably start paying me.But in spite of my most flawed interview techniques, I was getting an interesting answer.Sorry, New Hampshire voters would say, knowing they were stepping all over my tidy little narrative.Rubio’s too inexperienced.He’s too immature.I want someone who’s been a governor.Maybe in four years.They just didn’t seem to like him. The narrative that said they were supposed to peel off their Christie or John Kasich bumper stickers, turn in their Jeb! lawn signs, and get on the Rubio bandwagon hadn’t reached them.Had they missed the tweets? Didn’t they see Marco’s (third-place) victory speech in Iowa? Could they have actually missed ""Hardball""?I don’t mean to suggest Rubio is less popular than the polls here say. This isn’t an #unskew argument. A new Suffolk poll released Friday has Rubio surging, gaining on Trump. And I eventually found some Rubio supporters. I even found people who perfectly fit my narrative -- that they liked the Christies and the Kasichs, but Rubio was their guy. I only had to go to a Marco Rubio rally to find them.What I want to suggest, however, is this: There are still a lot of New Hampshire voters who are going to support the candidate they feel strongest about, despite a seemingly hopeless position in the polls.If you believe the polls -- and I see no compelling reason not to -- Rubio is going to come out of New Hampshire ordained as the establishment candidate. I’m just not sure the bandwagon effect is as strong as Rubio’s campaign is making it out to be.On Friday, the campaign moved an event from a middle school cafeteria to the gymnasium, citing “Marcomentum.”And at that rally, I heard plenty of voters tell me they want to pick a winner, someone who is viable, someone who can beat Trump and Hillary Clinton.But having spent the first 22 years of my life in New Hampshire, I’m familiar with the fierce independence of Granite State voters. As Howard Fineman pointed out in a piece Friday, voters here like to defy the conventional wisdom. And as these voters reminded me again and again, seeing candidates, shaking their hands, asking questions, taking pictures with them, and even withstanding a convenient Beltway narrative -- none of that seemed to have much of an impact on who they were voting for."

Also called Chinese New Year, or the Spring Festival, the holiday is steeped in layers of myths and traditions. It is celebrated in many countries throughout Asia, including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, and in other parts of the world where people with Asian heritage have settled. It is a time for families to come together to eat good food and participate in cultural traditions. Here's what you need to know about this celebration. 1. The date for Lunar New Year depends on the lunisolar calendar, which charts time based on the movements of both the moon and the sun. On the Gregorian calendar, the holiday will generally fall between Jan. 21 and Feb. 20. The festival reportedly traces its origins to the Shang Dynasty (between 1600 BC and 1100 BC), when people offered sacrifices to gods and ancestors to mark the end of an old year and the beginning of a new year. A legendary wild beast named Nien (or ""year"") was thought to attack people at the end of the old year. Villagers would use loud noises and bright lights to scare the creature away, a practice that slowly morphed into the Lunar New Year festivities.2. While the Western zodiac system is divided into 12 months, the Chinese zodiac is divided into 12 years. Each year is associated with an animal: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. People are said to be influenced by the personality of the animal that rules their birth year. There are a number of legends that tell the story of how the years were ordered. In one legend, Buddha called all the animals of the world to him before he left the earth. The only ones that listened were these 12 animals, so Buddha named a year after each of them in the order that they arrived.Another legend has the animals racing to see the Jade Emperor, which some Chinese traditions consider to be the ruler of Heaven. An old ox was in the lead, but he was a kind animal and when he saw a rat trying to cross a river, he stopped to help. But the rat was cunning -- just when they were about to climb onto the shore, the rat jumped off the ox and ran to the finish line, becoming the first animal in the cycle.3. This is the Year of the Monkey, the ninth animal in the cycle. The monkey features prominently in many ancient Chinese legends. People born in the Year of the Monkey are said to be intelligent, clever, and gregarious, but also mischievous. They are skilled and smart, but shortcomings, like a quick temper and a touch of arrogance, tend to hold them back. 4. Although Lunar New Year is rooted in religious traditions, in recent decades the holiday has become a largely cultural celebration. Still, it's a time when many people think about building up good luck for the year to come. Some families avoid doing certain things to make sure that they don't unwittingly set a precedent for the entire year. For example, people won't wear old, damaged clothing, so as not to carry bad luck into the new year. Some families try not to wash laundry, handle knives, or take out the garbage on this day to make sure they don't throw their good fortune away. Others believe it's mandatory to stay up late to welcome the new year.5. It's customary for adult children to travel home to be with their families during the holidays, particularly for the biggest celebration, which falls on New Year's Eve. This tradition leads to a massive travel season in China. In 2016, travelers were expected to make 2.9 billion trips between Jan. 21 and March 3, with the majority of those trips happening around Lunar New Year. The Chinese government has instituted a weeklong public holiday to celebrate the new year, giving people the chance to return to their hometowns or take vacations abroad. 6. The 15 days of New Year celebrations are filled with cultural activities. The most important meal is the one that falls on New Year's Eve. Families will eat traditional foods on that day, such as rice cakes, tangerines, fish, long noodles, and dumplings. Parents give their unmarried children red envelopes filled with money, called hong bao, during the holiday. The color red is a symbol of good luck in some Asian cultures. People will decorate their homes with lanterns and paper scrolls. Some communities organize cultural celebrations, which include dragon dances, parades and firecrackers. 7. In China, the celebrations end on the 15th day of the new year with the Festival of Lanterns. Some believe that this is the birthday of Tianguan, the Taoist god of good fortune. Others say that the lanterns are related to a legend about the Jade Emperor, who became incensed after humans hunted and killed his favorite crane. He planned to send a firestorm to destroy the village that was responsible. One man suggested that villagers hang red lanterns outside their houses, which helped trick the Jade Emperor into thinking that the village was already on fire. What zodiac year were you born in?

Long beloved by fans, expensive TV advertisements during the big game have lost some of their allure for corporate brands.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b527e41800006f0080b65c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Super Bowl ads aren't what they used to be.At least that’s the bet being made by companies with household-name brands like Gatorade, Reebok, Nike, Ford and Chevy that are sitting out this year’s big game. The price tag for a 30-second Super Bowl spot reached a new record this year, but that's unlikely why some corporate titans are shunning what's usually considered the biggest night in TV advertising. To a company as big as, say, Nike, $5 million can seem like a drop in the bucket. A more likely culprit is the Internet-inspired atomization of consumer culture.“There’s a lot of other places to spend your money that are more targeted, and a lot of admen like to do it like that,” said John Immesoete, who helped make hit Super Bowl ads for Budweiser and other big names, and is now chief creative officer for Epsilon, a data-driven advertising and marketing firm.Head over here to find out when and where to watch the Super Bowl. Head over here to find out when the Super Bowl will matter. The answer may surprise and depress you.This erosion of big advertisers means the Super Bowl features a shallower pool of creative talent adept at crafting ads that can appeal to multiple generations and demographic groups, according to Immesoete. And with ordinary TV ads now easy for consumers to avoid entirely -- think devices like TiVo and streaming services like Netflix -- companies are less willing to invest in hiring and developing that talent.The result, Immesoete said, is the rise of what he called “nichey humor"" in advertising. He pointed to Budweiser’s widely-panned dig at craft beer and the young people who drink it in last year’s Super Bowl as a sign that even his former client -- historically one with memorable ads from the game -- seemed to have lost its touch.“That seemed like an elephant battling mice,” Immesoete said. Before Anheuser-Busch's 2008 acquisition by global brewing giant InBev, he said “it is very doubtful that would have happened.” To complicate matters, the same social media and 24-hour news cycle that have turned advertising into a niche business have increased the scrutiny of Super Bowl ads. That means that while the payoff for a good advertisement -- and the tools needed to achieve that -- have diminished, the costs of failure have increased.“You become a lightning rod for controversy,” Immesoete said. “Now the risk is so high, people get cold feet.” Northwestern University business professors Tim Calkin and Derek Rucker made similar points in a HuffPost blog post. They noted it's also hard for a brand to stand out in a crowded field of competitors -- and on-field spectacles.“Despite all the attractive elements of being on the Super Bowl, it has an enormous amount of clutter,” Calkin and Rucker wrote. “During the game, people will see 60 or 70 ads, not counting network promo spots. In 2015, there were 71 national spots.”Still, Immesoete said he thinks many of the brands sitting out the big game -- and others like Doritos and Pepsi that have booked less airtime -- are making a mistake.“It is such a great opportunity, at a time when there are fewer opportunities for mass communication,” he said.There's one brand that Immesoete -- and plenty of other people -- are not sad to see go: Go Daddy, the Internet domain and website hosting company. “People are kind of relieved that Go Daddy is not there because they had a consistent strikeout record,” Immesoete said. “The taste level was pretty questionable and they went for a shock jock effect that worked a little less each year.”Here is a complete list of all the brands that will air Super Bowl ads. You can preview some that are already public."
