I've been around long enough to see the ways that the entertainment industry robs children of their wonder years.",2012-11-30,"Angus T Jones Camp Ronald McDonald For The Good Times 20th Annual Halloween Carnival Universal Studios Back Lot Universal City, CA 10/21/12 ￂﾩ Jill Johnson/jpistudios.com 310-657-9661",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c91622200003000d949bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are certain things about kids that never cease to amaze me. Like, the way my kids always reach into a full refrigerator and decide to snack on the main ingredient for my dinner plans. Or the amount of times my kids can walk over a pile of clothes on the floor of their room without noticing (or tripping). Or the way that everybody always acts surprised when a child star goes into a dramatic emotional free-fall toward rock bottom. Yeah, that's the one that really amazes me.If you live within Hollywood's Thirty-Mile-Zone and have a ""cute kid with personality,"" you will be approached regularly by casting directors, agents, managers and/or representatives of alleged schools who guarantee your child will be a star if you purchase their complete line of products and services. Having three cute sons with personality -- and living in the heart of the entertainment capital of the world -- I got so used to being approached that I would stop them before they finished the first sentence. Why? Because I have been around long enough to see the ways that the entertainment industry robs children of their wonder years and destroys their potential for a normal life.The downward spiral of Angus T. Jones is currently playing on a screen near you. According to imdbpro.com, Angus has been working since he was 4 years old. He has spent the past ten years -- more than half of his life -- co-staring on ""Two and A Half Men,"" one of the most commercially successful series in the CBS line-up. I was at the taping of the pilot of this series and attended many other tapings throughout the years. What I observed was a child who was treated extremely well by a cast and crew that respected his age. I also noted that there was always a friend by his side when he was backstage. So, where did things go wrong?No matter how anybody wants to spin it, Jones has never had a normal childhood. He may have attended a private Christian school when the show was not in production, but he could never be a normal student at any school where everybody was aware that he co-starred on a series his classmates were probably not allowed to watch. Jones has always lived in a world where strangers say ""YES"" to him. The coolest clothes and electronics magically appear in his life -- gifts from brands that hope he will be photographed with them on a red carpet. His handlers can't let him act out and rebel the way normal kids (yes, even mine) act out in public. So when the pressure cooker explodes, it never ceases to amaze me that everybody seems so surprised. Even more amazing is the annual western migration of stage mothers and their offspring, arriving from every corner of the nation in time for pilot casting season. They settle into the Oakwood and other temporary housing communities, often exhausting their family's savings in order to follow an impossible dream that most will never achieve. It would be comforting to think that Jones' public burnout might serve as a deterrent, but the more likely reality is that it won't make any difference. Murmurs of denial will echo throughout the city as stage mothers assure themselves nothing like that could ever happen to their cute kid with personality -- just like the parents of Angus T. Jones most certainly once assured themselves. Yet, the lure of success is so seductive that this kind of parent is willing to stretch the boundaries of what is age-appropriate until the point where the boundaries are no longer recognizable. Which is why it is necessary to note that the Mom and Dad Jones read the script for the pilot of ""Two and A Half Men"" and KNEW the situation they were putting their sweet, little 9-year-old Christian boy into from day one. Mom Jones recently told the press that she is concerned about her son's involvement in what she describes as a religious cult. However, the ""cult"" she refers to -- the Forerunner Christian Church -- describes itself as a Christian ministry that follows the teachings of Jesus. I will refrain from comment on that debate. To any parent who is considering joining this year's western migration, I urge you to watch my interview with former child star Paul Petersen. Petersen has devoted decades to A Minor Consideration -- a support and advocacy group for child actors. He's been there, done that and lived to tell the tale. If watching this interview saves one ""cute kid with personality"" from the tragedy that befalls so many child stars, it could be the most important hour you spend on behalf of your child."
5,DIVORCE,Divorce Causes: 5 Communication Habits That Lead To Divorce,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/divorce-5-communication-h_us_5b9c88e4e4b03a1dcc7f8d47,"By Deb Dutilh for YourTango.com Instead, adopt this simple one-liner that will train any man to jump up and help. ""Honey",2012-11-29,Man being tired of arguing with his wife in their living room,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c88e43c0000660009cbf6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Deb Dutilh for YourTango.comStudies show that a lack of communication is the number one reason couples get divorced. Nagging is a major culprit -- relentless reminders, suggestions and advice on how, when and why we should do things. But what are some of the other bad communication habits that erode away at relationships?1. Inauthenticity. How many times do you catch yourself saying ""yes"" when you really mean ""no?"" Do you say, ""I don't know"" for fear of being judged, dismissed or rejected? When we systematically accept things against our will, shut down to keep the peace and rationalize why that’s okay, we set ourselves up for resentment and anger down the line.Covering up our feelings and not trusting our partner to be mature enough to manage their response to ""no"" just won't work. It's better to say, ""No, I'm not available to discuss this right now. I need to unwind and think about it. I'll be ready to talk about it in an hour."" Then keep your promise.2. Incongruence. Most of our communication is non-verbal, and when it's out of sync with our words, we are sending mixed messages. No wonder couples argue, get frustrated and eventually tune each other out!When we say one thing while rolling our eyes, tightening our lips and/or shrugging shoulders, we send another message, usually one of being dismissive, defensive and/or judgmental. One way to avoid this is to maintain eye contact. This ensures active listening and allows you to focus on what the other person is saying instead of considering what you are planning on saying next.3. Win-lose attitude. In the world of neuro-linguistic programming, we say that effective communication is when your message is not simply sent, but transmitted and received by the listener. When talking about uncomfortable subjects, it's too easy to become judgmental, blaming and defensive -- tactics that all lead to communication breaking down.Priding yourself on being a pit-bull, taking things personally, finger-pointing, finding fault and needing to have the last word just doesnt work. Instead, set your intention for how you want the conversation to go so both of you win and take some time to really think about all the different possibilities and outcomes. Creating a peace treaty together that sets up the guidelines for communication to ensure smooth, respectful and authentic communication is a great tool.4. Interrupting, finishing sentences and forgetting to pause. This is a bundle because when you have one you almost always have the other two as well. How many of us have forgotten what we learned in grammar school? Don't interrupt and let the other person take time to formulate an answer. On this level, men and women communicate so differently.Men often complain that they are still thinking about an answer when their partner starts badgering them for a quicker response or asks another question while they are still thinking about the last one. Take time to pause by counting to 30 before saying anything at all and don't ask several questions at once. And while you're at it, do as we do in France: Roll your tongue around your mouth seven times before you speak.You might look like a cow chewing your cud but it forces you to slow down and really think about what you're going to say. It might even get a smile in an otherwise tense situation, but at least your partner will feel respected and know that you're patiently giving him to time to respond.5. Focusing on the negative, and impoliteness. Somewhere along the way, the idea of polite requests -- please, thank you and other words of appreciation in everyday conversations -- have gone the way of the Smith-Corona typewriter. From the classic, ""Don't leave the toilet seat up!"" to ""How long does it take to empty the trash?"" -- these commands are the quickest way to send a man to his man cave.Instead, adopt this simple one-liner that will train any man to jump up and help. ""Honey, I feel like a queen when you see the trash can is full and take it out for me! Thank you so much for doing that!"" There's nothing wrong with a little over the top appreciation which always works and is the best way to foster open, loving authentic communication.More Stories On YourTango: Are You A Nag? 9 Signs The Answer Is ‘Yes’8 Reasons Being Married Is Better15 Signs Men Have Too Much Power Over Your LifeFind A Relationship Expert!Dating After Divorce? 3 Pitfalls To Avoid"

Bush, and his wife former first lady Barbara Bush, arrive for the premiere of HBO's new documentary on his life near the family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine. Former President Bush has been hospitalized for about a week in Houston for treatment of a lingering cough. Bushￂﾒs chief of staff, Jean Becker, says the 88-year-old former president is being treated for bronchitis at Houstonￂﾒs Methodist Hospital and is expected to be released by the weekend. He was admitted Friday, Nov. 23, 2012. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c90cf240000310094ba6a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"George H.W. Bush, the 88-year-old former president, has been hospitalized for six days because of bronchitis, according to news reports.Bush's spokesman told CNN that the former president, who also has Parkinson's disease, was hospitalized because of a ""lingering cough,"" but that he may be able to go home by the weekend. Bronchitis is also known as a ""chest cold,"" and occurs when there is swelling and inflammation of the lungs' bronchial tubes. It can then cause coughing and can even lead to chest pain and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mucus also forms inside the bronchial tubes, which makes breathing difficult, the American Academy of Family Physicians reported. Bronchitis can either be acute or chronic -- acute bronchitis usually doesn't last much longer than two weeks, though some people may experience symptoms for as many as two months. Chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, is defined as bronchitis symptoms that is experienced for three or more months out of a year, for at least two years in a row, the CDC said. Chronic bronchitis is especially common in smokers. It is not known whether Bush was diagnosed with acute or chronic bronchitis. Bronchitis can be dangerous because it can sometimes lead to pneumonia, the Mayo Clinic reported. And if you continue to have multiple episodes of bronchitis, it can even be a sign of a more serious condition like tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis. Certain groups of people are more susceptible to it, such as smokers, and people who may have weaker immune systems like kids and older adults, according to the Mayo Clinic. Certain fumes from chemicals, or irritants that result from grain or textile work, can also trigger bronchitis. Bronchitis is a viral illness, so antibiotics usually don't work to treat it, the Mayo Clinic reported. However, there are some therapies that can ease symptoms, such as rest and pain medications, or measures to relieve the cough like cough medication, breathing in moist air, and getting plenty of fluids. Earlier his year, 93-year-old evangelist Billy Graham was also hospitalized for bronchitis, Slate reported. Like Bush, Graham also has Parkinson's disease. "
