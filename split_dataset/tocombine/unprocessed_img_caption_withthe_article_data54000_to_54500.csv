She described her brother, Callum MacPhee, as ""her rock"" and ""her shelter.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576453632200002d00f81aaa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A brother's instant reaction to his sister's pregnancy announcement is a sweet reminder of how close siblings can be.On Wednesday, Facebook page Love What Matters shared an old video of Lindsay MacPhee-Currie's pregnancy announcement. In the video, which was filmed in August 2014, she offers her older brother, Callum MacPhee, a bottle of wine at her home in Nova Scotia and jokes that she originally got it for herself, but that she can't ""drink for the next nine months."" In tears, her brother immediately hugs her. The announcement came as a shock to MacPhee-Currie's family, since doctors told her that her chances of conceiving on her own were low after receiving treatment for breast cancer. MacPhee-Currie received her breast cancer diagnosis in 2005 when she was 27 years old. She went through a lumpectomy, four sessions of chemotherapy and 29 sessions of radiation. After almost six months of intense treatment, doctors said everything looked clear. During the process, she learned treatment might affect her fertility, but it wasn't until she was 30 that a cyst on her ovary confirmed it. MacPhee-Currie and her husband eventually went through fertility treatments. When they didn't work, a doctor confirmed that her chances of becoming pregnant were low. ""One doctor came in and said, 'I am so sorry to tell you and I don’t quite know how to tell you this, but you’re slipping in and out of menopause and your chances of conceiving are pretty well next to none,'"" MacPhee-Currie told The Huffington Post.That's when she and her husband moved to Nova Scotia and looked into adopting. After starting the adoption process, she became sick. The then 36-year-old initially thought Thai food she ate with her family was responsible. Three pregnancy tests later, she confirmed she was expecting, and in August 2014, she told her brother, whom she described as a ""softie"" and ""the most amazing brother you could ever have.""MacPhee-Currie, whose ""miracle baby"" is now 14 months old, told HuffPost she felt compelled to submit the old video of her brother learning about her pregnancy after hearing about the events in Orlando this week, including the alligator attack on a 2-year-old at a Disney resort and the Pulse nightclub shooting. ""There's so much tragedy happening in the world lately and that's kind of all you're seeing,"" she said.Since being posted on Wednesday, the video has been viewed more than 524,000 times as of Friday. MacPhee-Currie said she hopes the video will encourage others facing fertility issues to not ""give up hope"" and that her brother's reaction will be proof that there's still good in the world.""For the world to see that reaction, I think it restores faith in humanity and that there is still a lot of love out there,"" she said."
1,POLITICS,Another Lawsuit Challenges Feds On Title IX Rules For Sexual Assault,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uva-grad-title-ix-lawsuit_us_57640874e4b015db1bc8ffc9,An accused former University of Virginia student argues the Education Department illegally enacted additional regulations for schools.,2016-06-17,A former University of Virginia law student is suing the U.S. Department of Education over guidance for schools on campus sexual assault.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576422fe2200002e00f819e5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A former law student at the University of Virginia accused of sexual assault filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education on Thursday, saying the federal government violated the law when it issued new guidance for how schools should handle sexual violence. Unlike most lawsuits from students accused of sexual assault, the case does not name UVA as a defendant and focuses solely on the Department of Education. The federal complaint claims that the Education Department violated the Administrative Procedure Act in 2011 when its Office for Civil Rights issued a ""Dear Colleague"" letter containing new guidance on adjudicating sexual assault and harassment claims. The letter was addressed to all colleges, universities and K-12 schools that receive federal funding.Under the gender equity law Title IX, schools must address reports of sexual harassment and assault. Among other things, the OCR letter told schools to use a standard known as ""preponderance of evidence"" to determine an accused student's guilt. In other words, the adjudicator must be at least 51 percent certain that an individual committed a violation to find the person guilty. Yet lawyers for the former UVA student say the government failed to give stakeholders a chance to respond to the federal guidelines -- including the preponderance standard -- before they were issued, as required by law. ""Campus sexual assault is a serious problem, but OCR doesn't get to break the law in order to solve it,"" Justin Dillon, an attorney handling the case, said in a statement Thursday. ""It needs to do what federal law requires -- tell the American people what it wants to accomplish, ask them for their feedback, and only then make a decision.""The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, the civil liberties group that orchestrated the lawsuit, has long objected to the Education Department letter. It's the third lawsuit to challenge the 2011 guidance.The two other suits were filed by a Colorado State University-Pueblo student who was suspended for an assault allegation, and by a Georgia lawmaker who doesn't have any personal experience with university misconduct cases and who legal experts doubt has standing to sue.Few details are available about the UVA plaintiff's misconduct case. He was charged with sexual misconduct in May 2015, but had to wait until January 2016 for a hearing, the suit said. He was found responsible of sexual misconduct for not obtaining ""effective consent"" during an alcohol-induced encounter with a former girlfriend, and was banned from UVA and ordered to undergo counseling as a result, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiff then passed the bar exam in Virginia and received his law degree in March. A retired judge who handled the former UVA student's case said the preponderance standard was the “first and foremost” factor in deciding his guilt.The plaintiff fears additional sanctions since UVA, his lawsuit notes, because the school was ordered to review all its sexual assault cases from the 2014-15 academic year after the Education Department found that the university had violated Title IX.UVA declined to comment, citing privacy laws.Education Department officials have said preponderance is the best standard for determining guilt in campus sexual misconduct cases because it's also used in civil lawsuits and gives both the accused and accuser a relatively equal chance of prevailing. Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights at the department, has spoken to lawmakers multiple times in recent years about the basis of its Title IX guidance. FIRE maintains, however, that civil lawsuits offer plaintiffs more due process protections. But federal officials have also noted that FIRE's own survey of 168 universities showed that 80 percent were using the preponderance standard prior to the Education Department's 2011 letter. The department modeled its mandate for schools on existing employment civil rights caselaw, officials said. Dozens of male students accused of sexual assault have sued their colleges and universities for rights violations. Those who have claimed to be victims of gender discrimination in violation of Title IX have frequently lost. However, those who've said their constitutional or contractual rights were violated -- including some of Dillon's clients -- have had more success. "
2,THE WORLDPOST,Aid Workers Struggle To Feed Aleppo Beneath The Bombs,"Alessandria Masi, Syria Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/feeding-aleppo-beneath-the-bombs_us_5764220fe4b015db1bc91f21,Mercy Corps is one of the only international humanitarian groups providing food aid to opposition-held areas of Aleppo city,2016-06-17,"Syrian Civil Defense volunteers respond to the bombing of a residential building in Aleppo city, April 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576428812200002d00f819f2.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mercy Corps is one of the only international humanitarian groups providing food aid to opposition-held areas of Aleppo city. Its humanitarian director for Syria, Ashley Proud, explains how it delivers aid and how it is preparing for an impending siege of Aleppo city.Relief and development agency Mercy Corps has been operating inside Syria since 2008, and when the war broke out in 2011 it became one of the biggest providers of humanitarian aid to both government and opposition areas. But in 2014, nearly three years after the start of the conflict, the Syrian government gave it an ultimatum – stop working in rebel-held areas of the country or leave Syria.The Syrian government’s demand was a clear violation of the United Nations Security Council resolution that states that all those in need of humanitarian aid be able to receive it, regardless of their location or allegiance.At that point, Mercy Corps was able to reach 1.7 million civilians in the opposition-held northern part of the country – more than any other charity working in Syria. So on April 30, 2014, Mercy Corps shut down its headquarters in Damascus, and began working on an alternative way to get much-needed humanitarian aid to civilians in rebel-held areas.Mercy Corps moved the base of its Syria operation to Gaziantep, a Turkish town on Syria’s northern border. From there, it was able to start cross-border aid deliveries, a multimillion-dollar operation being funded by several Western governments, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).Mercy Corps was not the only humanitarian organization to make the move. Today, at least 30 international NGOs operating in Syria are based in Gaziantep, including such Western-funded organizations as the International Rescue Committee, World Vision, GOAL and Relief International.Cross-border operations present a much higher risk for humanitarian organizations. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has declared any such deliveries as a violation of the country’s sovereignty and a “pretext to aggression.”The Syrian government’s decree against humanitarian operations is only one of several dangers associated with cross-border operations. Delivery routes from Gaziantep into Syria’s opposition-held areas are frequently the target of aerial bombings. The group in control of these routes and checkpoints, with whom organizations like Mercy Corps must negotiate for access, can change frequently and without warning.Despite the increasing risks today, Mercy Corps is able to reach 570,000 people every month in Syria. In some areas, such as opposition-controlled Aleppo city, they are the only source of food for civilians trapped by the ongoing fighting.The opposition stronghold of Aleppo city, the largest urban center in Syria, has been under increased fire from aerial bombardment since February when the Syrian government and its allies launched a major operation to take back the area. Months later, government-aligned forces have now nearly encircled the city and have cut off the most direct and prominent supply lines into the city.Ashley Proud, Mercy Corps’ humanitarian director for Syria, spoke to Syria Deeply about the organization’s work inside the opposition-held areas of Aleppo, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are bracing themselves for imminent siege.Syria Deeply: Mercy Corps is one of the few organizations able to bring aid into opposition-held areas of Aleppo, despite the Syrian government refusing access to these sites. How has your organization been able to achieve this from its base in Gaziantep?Ashley Proud: Mercy Corps works across Syria with dedicated team members and in partnership with local aid associations. Our team in Syria operates at great personal risk – they are working on the front lines of the conflict. We know they aren’t doing it for us – they are Syrians and they are committed to supporting their communities. They know their work is essential. As the conflict drags on, more and more of the families we help tell us that we are their only source of food and that they have run out of money.At Mercy Corps, we don’t believe that where you live or under which authority you live should impact your ability to feed your children. A civilian is a civilian, and brigades moving around your house or trading control of your town don’t change that.Syria Deeply: Aleppo is considered one of the most dangerous cities in Syria today. What are the most basic needs of civilians living in Aleppo today, and what are some of the major security risks your team faces on the ground?In rural areas of northern Aleppo governorate, Mercy Corps provides private bakeries with free flour for bread, with the agreement that they sell the bread – a staple of the Syrian diet – at an affordable price. Through this effort, we ensure that families can depend on inexpensive bread and bakers can stay in business, which in turn helps support the local economy.Additionally, Mercy Corps provides standard food baskets to approximately 75,000 people in Aleppo city each month. For families able to stay in their homes, food kits contain rice, lentils, cooking oil and other items that require a kitchen. For families who are newly displaced, we provide emergency kits containing ready-to-eat food, as well as mattresses, tarps and new arrival kits containing blankets, cooking utensils and other essential supplies.Sometimes when the violence is very bad, our team members have gone door-to-door delivering food baskets to families, rather than have people gather in one place. Sadly today even groups of hungry civilians can become a target in Syria. We’re honored to have the opportunity to offer a little bit of relief in Aleppo and in other parts of the country.Syria Deeply: Mercy Corps continued to operate in Aleppo after the fighting increased in February. How has the uptick in fighting affected your operations on the ground?Proud: Right now we are very concerned because the increase in violence since mid-May has made it all but impossible to get trucks into Aleppo city. Thanks to our pre-positioning of stocks in the city, we are still able to support the people who count on us, but those supplies will not last forever.We have been operating for several years now on the front lines of the conflict. Our teams are used to operating in frontline environments so when they feel the risks are too high it means that it’s just too dangerous right now.Syria Deeply: In the last two weeks there has been a severe increase in the number of airstrikes in opposition-held areas of Aleppo. How have the aerial bombardments impeded aid deliveries?Proud: On the most basic level, when there are airstrikes or shelling, trucks and aid workers cannot move. Right now, a significant increase in strikes has prevented us from getting supplies into Aleppo city for the past few weeks. Day by day and hour by hour we watch movements on the ground and identify the safest routes but trucks full of food and other supplies can present a target.At the same time, airstrikes and clashes on the ground cause families to flee their homes in search of places where they will be safe. Mercy Corps is working in camps for displaced Syrians on the Syrian side of the Turkish border, as well as with people who have taken refuge in schools, mosques, with area families or have simply settled in the open air throughout Aleppo governorate.When people are displaced, they often flee their homes with nothing. We are working as swiftly as possible to bring supplies into northern Syria, both to support civilians who remain in Aleppo city and to adjust our deliveries to meet the changing needs of those forced to flee.Syria Deeply: Civilians and aid organizations are most concerned about the possibility of Aleppo city coming under siege. What are we likely to see in the event of a siege?Proud: No one really knows for sure what is in Aleppo’s future. What we do know is that approximately 300,000 civilians inside the city rely in some way on cross-border humanitarian aid. We are deeply concerned that people will at some point be completely cut off from any humanitarian assistance. A long-term closure of humanitarian access into Aleppo would cause conditions inside Aleppo city to rapidly deteriorate. When access is restricted for a few days or weeks, we observe corresponding rises in prices of bread, diesel and other basics.Stressful conditions bring out the worst in some people and the best in others. If there were a complete lack of access, we’d expect to see some people hoarding commodities in an attempt to make a profit off of higher prices as conditions worsened. But at Mercy Corps we see our team members inside Aleppo committed to staying in the city and working however they can to provide some measure of comfort to their fellow citizens. We are inspired by them and will do what we can to support them, whatever happens.Syria Deeply: What measures is Mercy Corps taking to prepare for a siege of Aleppo city?Proud: We are calling on the international community to prevent a siege situation, insisting that civilians be allowed freedom of movement if they wish to leave the city, and that unfettered humanitarian access be guaranteed so food, water, fuel and other essentials can be brought in.Practically speaking, whenever we see increases in violence – clashes, shelling or airstrikes – we plan and prepare for the possibility that civilians will flee that violence in search of safety. We pre-position stocks, including what we call “new arrival kits,” which contain some household basics for starting over.Over the past few months we have done our best to increase stocks of nonperishable food items in Aleppo city: dried dates, white bread, cooked chickpeas, salt, mixed spices, olive oil, canned fish and canned vegetables, rice, lentils and cooking oil. As soon as the security situation allows it, we will resume these shipments.Syria Deeply: Mercy Corps works closely with individual civilians on the ground. From your conversations with those still in Aleppo city, what would you say is their most dire need at the moment?Proud: More than anything, people tell us they want peace. The families we speak to want an end to the violence. Barring that, what needs to happen right now is that all parties to the conflict need to allow unfettered and safe humanitarian access to all parts of the country.People tell us they want to be able to take care of themselves and provide for their families, and not depend on handouts. Our proudest moments are when we are able to offer a family seeds and tools so they can plant a kitchen garden or repair their family farm. We know it is possible to do more than just give people food and blankets. Even in the worst conditions of this war, people want to rebuild their lives and provide their children with education, comfort and a future.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

The lawyers have told German media that a large part of the files presented in court were supplied by Turkish authorities.""It looks like a job on orders from Erdogan,"" Peer Stolle, who is representing two of the defendants, told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper of Munich, where the trial was being held.Left-wing activists chanted ""Long live international solidarity"" and held up colorful banners outside the court building as the defendants arrived.Turkey has said it is discussing countermeasures since the ruling on the Armenian killings and that it threatens the friendship between them just as Chancellor Angela Merkel is relying on Ankara to stem the flow of migrants to Europe.Germany's federal prosecutor says the main defendant, known as Muslum E., was the leader of the foreign branch of TKP/ML from 2004 and helped raise about half a million euros ($560,000) in funds annually for the group.Muslum E. shouted political slogans and pumped his fist in the air as he entered the courtroom. Spectators in the public gallery cheered and applauded the defendants.The other nine are accused of being members of the leadership committee and procuring money, as well as organizing propaganda events. They are also accused of recruiting new members and organizing a military training camp in Iraq.A spokeswoman for the higher regional court in Munich said the defendants were not charged with committing acts of terror directly but rather with being members of the TKP/ML.""So they are alleged to have voted on organizational matters as well as the execution of said attacks,"" she told Reuters TV.The group were arrested between April and November 2015, in Germany, France, Austria and Switzerland.Describing the TKP/ML's activities, the prosecutor said in a January indictment: ""The group has carried out numerous attacks with firearms and explosives and committed arson which caused many people to be killed or injured.""The trial is due to run until Oct. 28.(Reporting by Caroline Copley and Reuters TV; Editing by Mark Heinrich)"

The lawyers have told German media that a large part of the files presented in court were supplied by Turkish authorities.""It looks like a job on orders from Erdogan,"" Peer Stolle, who is representing two of the defendants, told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper of Munich, where the trial was being held.Left-wing activists chanted ""Long live international solidarity"" and held up colorful banners outside the court building as the defendants arrived.Turkey has said it is discussing countermeasures since the ruling on the Armenian killings and that it threatens the friendship between them just as Chancellor Angela Merkel is relying on Ankara to stem the flow of migrants to Europe.Germany's federal prosecutor says the main defendant, known as Muslum E., was the leader of the foreign branch of TKP/ML from 2004 and helped raise about half a million euros ($560,000) in funds annually for the group.Muslum E. shouted political slogans and pumped his fist in the air as he entered the courtroom. Spectators in the public gallery cheered and applauded the defendants.The other nine are accused of being members of the leadership committee and procuring money, as well as organizing propaganda events. They are also accused of recruiting new members and organizing a military training camp in Iraq.A spokeswoman for the higher regional court in Munich said the defendants were not charged with committing acts of terror directly but rather with being members of the TKP/ML.""So they are alleged to have voted on organizational matters as well as the execution of said attacks,"" she told Reuters TV.The group were arrested between April and November 2015, in Germany, France, Austria and Switzerland.Describing the TKP/ML's activities, the prosecutor said in a January indictment: ""The group has carried out numerous attacks with firearms and explosives and committed arson which caused many people to be killed or injured.""The trial is due to run until Oct. 28.(Reporting by Caroline Copley and Reuters TV; Editing by Mark Heinrich)"

Her perspective on the effects of toxic chemicals and climate change on the Arctic have transformed the issues of science, politics and economics into those of human rights.OTTAWA, CANADA: Speaking at WWF-Canada’s Ocean Summit held in Ottawa last week, longtime Inuit activist and former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council Sheila Watt-Cloutier argued that the fate of the Arctic transcends the political, economic and scientific spheres, and should be fought at the legal level, with the language of human rights.“Knowing that the Arctic is the air conditioner of our planet, and that it is breaking down at an unprecedented speed, it seems to me that it would be the business of the world to keep us alive,” said Sheila Watt-Cloutier, whose active involvement as a voice of the Inuit people led her to receive multiple honorary degrees, awards and a Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 2007.An Inuk from Kuujjuaq, Nunavik, in Northern Quebec, Watt-Cloutier was the first to link human rights to climate change. “I spent the first 10 years of my life travelling in dogsled, fishing for food,” she said. In a matter of a few decades, that livelihood has dramatically changed. The presence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the fish and animals they eat and melting ice and snow threaten Inuit health, safety and security.Recent and ongoing changes in the Arctic are profound and challenge Inuit cultural and environmental human rights – the “right to be cold,” as she states in the title of her book. “We are a hunting, gathering, fishing people, and with the melting of the ice, it has become increasingly difficult to gather food and practice our culture,” she said.A few hours before Watt-Cloutier walked on stage, Shell Canada announced it had relinquished its oil and gas exploration permits near Lancaster Sound in the eastern Arctic. “This is astounding,” said Watt-Cloutier, breaking away from her prepared speech. “I never thought I would ever say something like this but, I commend Shell for that.”Inuit have fought since the early 1970s to protect the zone as a National Marine Conservation Area. Although the news doesn’t guarantee that the once-permitted zone will be included in the boundaries of the conservation area, Inuit leaders perceive it as a good step forward.“Nothing focuses the mind more than litigation,” said Paul Crowley, VP-Arctic with the WWF-Canada, which filed a lawsuit in April demanding Shell’s permits be invalidated. “The Inuit community had been asking since 1971 that the area be protected. It was traumatizing to them and to the land that it wasn’t for all this time, and we are still evaluating the impact of that,” said Crowley.The first successful campaign that involved Inuit, in the 1980s, led to the Stockholm Convention on POPs, which banned 12 persistent organic pollutants referred to as the “dirty dozen,” including DDT and PCBs. The U.N. treaty was signed quickly, ratified and enforced due to Inuit’s role, said Watt-Cloutier.Although Inuit continue to feel the impact of POPs, because these substances remain in the environment, Watt-Cloutier sees the treaty as a tremendous victory – and one to build upon. “We [Inuit people] did it with pollutants in the 1980s. We are able to move mountains,” she said. “We should lead the world on the climate change battle.”“There are 155,000 Inuit living north of the 66th parallel. It is incredible that they were heard at the international level despite their small population,” said Crowley, who credits the leadership of Inuit women, including Watt-Cloutier. “They speak with a voice of integrity. That is what distinguishes them.”“I remember when Sheila first brought up the question of human rights at a meeting in Milan in early 2000. The meeting was very dry and technical. She started talking about people and how the changing climate was affecting her people. It was like an oasis in the desert,” said Crowley.“Before Sheila’s leadership on this issue, even the human rights community was not convinced until it was finally adopted in COP21 (Conference of the Parties) last December,” said Crowley, who was her legal counsel before he joined WWF-Canada.“Our success is due to effective collaborative work with other indigenous peoples,” said Okalik Eegeesiak, the current chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC). She is also quick to praise Watt-Cloutier for her leading role. “Her influence is huge. Where do I start? The human rights argument is her initiative.”It took 15 years of campaigning and lobbying governments to finally have the survival and livelihood of the Indigenous peoples linked to climate change and included in the final texts of the COP21. “COP21 could have been stronger and more explicit detailing our implication, but it is a step forward,” said Eegeesiak.“What Sheila did is to put a human face of the issues that we are confronted with,” said ICC Canada president, Nancy Karetak-Lindell. “It is very easy to forget when drafting policies in Ottawa that there are human tragedies linked to the changing climate of the Arctic.”Despite her success, Watt-Cloutier can also be be critical.“We have too many institutions that overlap. There is a danger to that,” she said. In order to pursue a successful campaign on the international level, these institutions have to become more coordinated and efficient, she said.It is a sentiment echoed by her successor, Karetak-Lindell: “The way we have been doing things in the past no longer works. We have to move forward by embracing alternative energies, for instance.”This article originally appeared on Arctic Deeply.

Dates were also on the menu, which many Muslims eat to break their fast before the iftar meal.Sixty people, including the Rockyview Alliance Church congregation, Muslim refugees, and volunteers from the community attended the iftar.Up to 1,500 of the 25,000 refugees Canada has welcomed between November 2015 and February 2016 have been resettled in Calgary, and are now seeking meaningful integration into the local community. Most of the refugees who broke their fast at Rockyview have been studying English at the church, to improve their job prospects and enhance communication with the locals. “We’ve had English language classes at the church for years, and since many of our students this year are Muslims, most of them coming from Syria, we decided to spend a beautiful evening together and give them a taste of Ramadan,” Rockyview’s lead pastor, Shawn Vickar, told HuffPost Arabi.The event intended to build bridges of love and understanding with the refugees, so that they would feel at peace in Canada, Vickar explained.Sam Namoura, founder of the Syrian Refugee Support Group in Calgary, says that the event was an opportunity for the church congregation to learn about fasting and the month of Ramadan.“The congregation was very excited about the event,” Namoura said. “They paid attention to the tiniest details, including the types of food that Muslims would break their fast with.”“They even set up a spot for people to pray, and laid done prayer rugs and then asked me if they were facing Mecca,” Namoura added.Erfan Taana, a Syrian refugee from Daraa, was pleasantly surprised by the initiative. “It had never crossed my mind that a church would host an iftar for Muslims, and I would be among them,” he told HuffPost Arabi.“I left feeling overwhelmed with emotion. I became much more positive, me and the other Syrians in Calgary [who attended the event]. We left with newfound enthusiasm to come together with our Canadian brothers and build ‘our Canada,’” he said.This piece originally appeared on HuffPost Arabi and has been translated into English. "

That process is a formality.The Supreme Court ruling covered willing adults facing intolerable physical or psychological suffering from a severe and incurable medical condition.The Liberal government, though, narrowed the scope of the legislation to cover only those people whose death was reasonably foreseeable.Critics said this would condemn people with degenerative conditions like multiple sclerosis to unbearable suffering.Government officials say the new law is a first attempt to address a highly sensitive and controversial topic and could be broadened in years to come."
17,POLITICS,Support For Gun Control Spikes After Orlando Shooting,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gun-poll-orlando-shooting_us_576322a2e4b0fbbc8be9d8d5,Most respondents in a recent poll believe the shooting was both an act of terrorism and a hate crime.,2016-06-16,President Barack Obama receives a T-shirt from Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer as he arrives in the city to meet with families of victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576324c31500002b0073b084.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Support for stricter gun laws is up sharply after America's most deadly mass shooting to date, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.Americans are more concerned about gun violence and more optimistic that such shootings can be stopped than they were in a poll taken just days before the attacks.A 55 percent majority of respondents now say they support stricter guns laws, up 7 points since earlier this month. The share of Americans who believe that gun violence is a very serious problem rose by a similar margin, while the percentage who think that passing gun control is possible and that shootings are preventable saw smaller upticks.Specific gun control policies are even more popular. Eighty-six percent of Americans polled support closing the so-called terror gap by passing a law preventing individuals on the terror watch list from purchasing firearms. Sixty-two percent back a ban on the sale of assault rifles. Most Americans are classifying the shooting as both an act of terrorism and a hate crime -- 65 percent of respondents following news about the Orlando shooting say they have done so, as has the FBI. Thirteen percent say the attack was a hate crime but not an act of terrorism, 6 percent that it was terrorism but not a hate crime, and the rest are unsure.Meanwhile, the country remains divided on presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump's call to bar Muslims from the United States, with 44 percent in favor and 41 percent opposed. But there has always been wide variation across surveys on the issue: A new NBC/SurveyMonkey poll found slightly higher support for such a ban, while a CBS News poll conducted over the same time period found a majority opposed.More generally, Americans aren't convinced by Trump's attempt to paint a shooting carried out by a U.S.-born citizen as a consequence of lax immigration laws. Just 28 percent of respondents who followed news about the shooting say tougher immigration laws would have prevented the attack, while 44 percent say that stricter gun control would have made a difference.Guns have risen in prominence as an election issue. Fifty-two percent of registered voters polled say that gun control will be very important in their vote for president this year, up 10 points from the previous survey.That change comes largely from Democratic voters. Prior to the shooting, Republicans and Democrats were equally likely to rate gun issues as a very important election issue, at 45 percent and 44 percent, respectively. In the post-shooting survey, however, the percentage jumped to 63 percent for Democratic respondents, while the Republican percentage remained unchanged.The shooting also may have modestly changed voters' minds about which party they most trust to handle gun issues. Prior to the shooting, Republicans had a 3-point advantage; afterward, Democrats gained a 1-point edge. While few members of either party budged, independent voters swung from giving the GOP a 17-point lead on the issue to giving Democrats a 6-point advantage.It's less clear, however, whether the aftermath of the Orlando attack will directly benefit any presidential candidate, especially if it's framed as an issue related to terrorism rather than gun violence. Voters are somewhat more likely to disapprove of Trump's response -- 52 percent of those who followed news about the shooting disapprove of how he reacted, compared to 46 percent who disapprove of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's reaction. But 39 percent of voters say they trust Trump more than Clinton to handle the threat of terrorism, while 36 percent say the opposite. A solid fifth don't trust either candidate. There's no guarantee that fears raised by the Orlando shooting will even last until the election. Far from reflecting an unprecedented sea change, the newest poll shows public opinion returning to about where it was after last year's shooting in San Bernardino, California. That attack, like a host of others before it, failed to produce much in the way of political change before the nation's concerns dissipated. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted June 14 through June 16 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Stephen Daldry, the man behind ""Billy Elliot,"" is set to direct with Marc Platt acting as producer. Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman, the pair who wrote the music and lyrics for the Broadway production, will pen the film's screenplay. As of press time, there have been no casting announcements, but we can only hope that Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are included in some way. Both Menzel and Chenoweth earned Tony nominations for their roles, as Elphaba and Glinda respectively, in 2004 (Menzel took home the statue), and it would be absolutely wonderful to see them on screen together.

19,POLITICS,Trump's Supporters May Be The Real Puppetmasters Of His Hateful Campaign,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-greensboro-hate_us_5762bd0fe4b0df4d586f64b4,A writer wonders whether Trump's rowdy fans are actually leading the White House run.,2016-06-16,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina on June 14, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576303f41500002f001b9dfb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scenes from Donald Trump's rally at the Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina Tuesday will keep the writer Jared Sexton, who teaches at Georgia Southern University, awake at night.It wasn't just the cries of ""Bitch!"" (for Hillary Clinton) or, ""The gays had it coming"" (for the Orlando shooting victims) that rattled Sexton. It wasn't even that he heard ""more than a few"" in Trump's audience hurl racial epithets and encourage anti-Trump protesters to kill themselves. ""I surprised by the casualness and joy they took in their hatred,"" said Sexton.To Sexton, who has made something of a study of Trump rallies, Tuesday marked a turning point. He had attended four previous Trump events since he began following presidential campaigns from both parties last year.Greensboro, Sexton said, made him question who is steering the angry -- and at times violent -- rhetoric that has become a staple of Trump's campaign. The event ""was the first time I walked away with the idea that maybe it’s not as simple as, 'He’s the ringleader,'"" Sexton said in phone interview. ""I’m starting to wonder if he’s not the one behind the wheel.""Sexton tweeted his observations of the rally as he lined up with other attendees outside. Twitter soon made made his tweets into a Moment -- a curated feed from an event -- which gave users a glimpse inside the rally through Sexton's eyes.(See Sexton's full timeline of the Trump rally below.)Sexton, a creative writing professor, said he holds his working-class roots in southern Indiana ""very near and dear to my heart."" He said he recognizes his family and himself in many of Trump's supporters. That's why he wanted to ""go an extra step"" to try to understand Trump's aggressive backers.""I can understand why, maybe in the beginning, working-class people flocked to Trump,"" Sexton said. ""To put in clumsily, he was almost an antidote to a 'politically correct' culture a lot of people found stifling and dangerous.""Trump despises what he calls political correctness, and has made bold but vague proclamations of jobs, wealth and greatness aimed at a segment of the population that feels marginalized by a progressive agenda. That makes him an appealing leader figure to whom supporters can ""take their frustrations, economically and socially,"" Sexton said.The worst of the rhetoric that circulates at Trump events can be divided into two general categories, Sexton said. ""One I would describe as a casual country club-like hate,"" Sexton said. ""Trump events are outlets for people to come out and engage in hatred that society has kind of pushed aside -- and they kind of revel in it.""There's another side that’s kind of nihilistic — like wanting to burn everything down,"" Sexton said. ""I don’t know if it was cathartic or symptomatic. But it was obvious that so many were feeling it.""Sexton was quick to point out that not all Trump supporters espoused such views, and he doesn't broad-stroke all of the candidate's followers as hateful bigots, racists and misogynists. Loyalty, he noted, has long been a core tenet of the Republican Party, and likely what keeps much of the party's ""old guard"" engaged in the campaign.""They’re conservative. They care about their country. Maybe you don’t agree with their social beliefs or even their economic beliefs, but you can at least say ‘they’re a civil person,'"" Sexton said. ""But I see a lot of them at these Trump things, and at times I can catch a flicker in their eyes of, 'What am I doing here? What is this and how did I get here?'"" Trump, Sexton said, has created a ""strange, reality-bending political correctness-free zone.""""So afterwards, his supporters feel justified,"" he said. ""It's like a collegial, ‘We’re all here enjoying this Donald Trump rally, and it’s great we can be ourselves.'"" Sexton described the most engaged rally-goers as seeming almost shocked that there were protesters in their midst. He claimed at one point, a supporter asked people in the audience to crowd to clap if they agreed with that Trump was saying as a way to sniff out who was a genuine supporter and who was an interloper. ""People looked at protesters, stripped them of their humanity, and had a desire to do them actual harm,"" Sexton said. ""And I don’t think there are few of them."" Sexton, after previous Trump rallies, wrote that he wouldn't be surprised if someone dies at a Trump event before the campaign is over. ""These people were comfortable in their anger,"" he said.By now, Sexton said he's unconvinced that Trump believes some of what he's saying. He's even gone back to watch old Trump interviews and appearances to compare positions that now seem relatively moderate to Trump's current demagogic views.""I think this is a matter of opportunism. Maybe he’s tricked himself into believing he thinks these things,"" Sexton said. As for Trump's supporters, Sexton said he thinks many back Trump more as an excuse than as a candidate. “I wanted really, really, badly to at least afford [Trump supporters] empathy,"" Sexton said. ""But there’s something else going on here. There’s some kind of ugliness in these people. I’m not sure if they’re nihilistic or more violent than other people. I’m not sure if sure if they’ve gone beyond anger to the other side of rationality."" During his five-hour drive back to Georgia after the rally, Sexton reflected on what he said frightens him the most about what he witnessed.""What I can’t get out of my head is that while Donald Trump will likely be defeated, that’s not going to make these people go away,"" he said. ""They’re not going to pack up their bags and go home; they’re here. And I’m afraid this sort of provocation is going to amount to something more.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
20,POLITICS,House Republicans Vote To Block Military From Using Bases To Temporarily Shelter Immigrant Kids,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-unaccompanied-minors-military-bases_us_57630892e4b09c926cfea268,"A county commissioner in Alabama already told the government the children are ""not welcome"" there.",2016-06-16,Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) says President Barack Obama's policies are to blame for unaccompanied minors coming to the U.S. without authorization. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two years ago, when the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border reached crisis levels and overwhelmed existing housing options, the government opened temporary emergency shelters at three military bases. Since then, officials have considered using military bases as potential spaces to temporarily house the unaccompanied minors if they run out of beds elsewhere. Also in that time, Republicans have argued that providing even short-term shelter for children at military bases is wrong, partly because the minors shouldn't be in the U.S. in the first place. Those Republicans won on Thursday, when the House of Representatives voted to block the military from temporarily housing unaccompanied minors on military bases through two amendments to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act.Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who authored one of the amendments, said Thursday that President Barack Obama had ""put out the welcome mat"" to encourage Central Americans to come to the U.S. without authorization. The government seemed to insist it has responsibility ""for everybody on the planet that the president has sympathy for,"" he added.""Our military should not be used to inappropriately house and be part of the welcome party that the president has set up that's encouraging people to come into the United States illegally,"" King said on the House floor ahead of the vote. Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.), who offered the other amendment that passed Thursday, tweeted afterward that he hoped it would keep unaccompanied minors from being temporarily placed in his district, something the government reportedly has been considering. The congressman said on the House floor Wednesday that the Department of Health and Human Services, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied minor immigrants, was refusing to do its job by using shelters near the border, and instead burdening the Department of Defense. A Baldwin County commissioner told HHS earlier this week that the county did not want unaccompanied children in shelters there.""I don't want to be rude but ... you're not welcome,"" Commissioner Chris Elliott said. ""We are not interested in having these facilities here.""Central American minors who cross the border without their parents go into the custody of HHS, which then seeks to place them either with family members or in foster care as they go through deportation proceedings. HHS is currently operating a temporary shelter for unaccompanied minors at a Department of Labor property in Florida, according to a spokeswoman. If more beds were needed, though, HHS could reopen a shelter at the Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. The government has apprehended nearly 33,000 unaccompanied minors at the border so far this fiscal year."

The Welsh immigrant and noted philanthropist is a partner at Sequoia Capital, made key investments in Google, WhatsApp and PayPal, and has a net worth of nearly $3 billion. Moritz isn't the only notable investor pointing out Trump's flaws when it comes to finance. Fellow venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Mark Cuban have also been openly critical of the GOP candidate's campaign and business dealings.Nowhere is the contrast between Trump and self-made billionaires more apparent than in Silicon Valley, says Moritz. Not only did many of the industry's most successful members come from nothing (by comparison, Trump's dad gave him a ""small loan"" of $1 million), but they also were immigrants to boot.In support of his thesis, Moritz recalls the experience of WhatsApp founder Jan Koum, a Ukranian immigrant once reliant on food stamps; Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, an immigrant from Taiwan, who knew only one English word when he arrived in the U.S. at the age of 10; Sergey Brin, who co-founded a little company by the name of ""Google,"" having escaped the Soviet Union in the 1970s; the list goes on....(Not on Moritz's list, but also worthy of note: Elon Musk -- the founder of Tesla, SolarCity and SpaceX, and co-founder of Pay-Pal -- an immigrant from South Africa and Canada who turned a $28,000 loan from his father into a net worth of $12.8 billion.)Even when playing to his supposed strength of real estate, Trump's business braggadocio bears scrutiny. As Moritz points out, both Michael Bloomberg and and Stephen Ross, multibillionaires with roots in real estate, have significantly outperformed Trump on about the same timelines. Same goes for folks like Warren Buffet, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.""The astonishing thing about Mr Trump’s business career — given what he received — is not how much he has achieved but how little,"" Moritz writes. ""His actual performance, compared to the myth he has assiduously cultivated, is so mediocre.""The entirety of the column, wherein Moritz breaks down dollar amounts and concludes Trump may have had more financial success if he'd just invested in an index fund, is worth reading. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Another issue, however, has been pushed to the forefront by active and retired NFL players, but it's also affected Americans outside of football: painkiller or opioid addiction.The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services issued an opioid overdose epidemic public health alert in 2014, but in football circles, trainers and doctors still give their injured players potentially addicting painkillers. NFL offensive lineman Eugene Monroe, whose contract was terminated on Wednesday by the Baltimore Ravens, has openly decried football's painkiller crisis and instead advocates for non-addictive cannabinoids.While recovering from a January shoulder surgery, Monroe wrote a personal essay about using marijuana versus opioids, donated $80,000 to medical marijuana researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Pennsylvania, started his own website to centralize his efforts, and influenced the NFL enough to have its top doctors speak to the aforementioned researchers to learn about their work. All of this, done in one offseason!The Ravens' weren't impressed, though. Their apparent discomfort with Monroe's pro-marijuana stance has led him to ponder whether his advocacy had anything to do with his release. Just days before his release was made official, Monroe made a very public health- and safety-angled point to the Ravens: You don't want me around because I'm trying to fix how we're cared for. Monroe wouldn't definitively say that his campaigning had anything to do with his release -- as ESPN's pointed out, there were a slew of football-related, financial and salary-cap reasons to dump the contract of their highest-paid, often-injured and most underperforming player. ""I can't say for sure whether or not my stance on medical cannabis was the reason the Ravens released me,"" he told The New York Times on Wednesday. ""However, as I've said in the past, they have distanced themselves from me and made it clear that they do not support my advocacy.""  Monroe's statement following his release.Currently, medical marijuana is on the NFL's banned substances list (even though two states where the NFL does business have legalized the drug). During the 2016 offseason, Monroe openly campaigned for the NFL to reconsider their marijuana ban -- the first time an active player has done so --which the Ravens weren't thrilled about.In March, Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said, ""I promise you, he does not speak for the organization,"" when reporters asked him about Monroe's marijuana outspokenness. His answer is pretty unsurprising. Unless it's, say, Seattle Seahawks' Pete Carroll, who coaches in a state where marijuana is legal, the head coach of an NFL franchise isn't likely to openly call for medical marijuana use.But Harbaugh's wording indicates an adversarial attitude toward Monroe and his fight. He went out of his way to protect his organization against Monroe's stance, when a more dismissive answer to the question would've been fine and wouldn't have publicly antagonized Monroe. Instead of standing up for his players' right to free speech or lightly brushing off Monroe's individualism, Harbaugh clearly went out of his way to condemn Monroe within the context of the team. It's no surprise Monroe's a free agent now. More broadly, Monroe's pro-marijuana push has perhaps hurt his future career prospects. He plays in a league that's so uptight about drug usage that star wide receiver Josh Gordon could miss two consecutive seasons for failing marijuana tests. Lest we forget, top draft prospect Laremy Tunsil slipped in April's 2016 NFL Draft because a video of him smoking a bong leaked moments before it started.Considering that hundreds of active NFL players are estimated to regularly use marijuana to ease their week-to-week pain, the overall NFL attitude toward the drug is backwards. They don't approve of pot, but prescription painkillers -- drugs that retired NFL players are four times more likely to abuse than the general population, according to a study published in Drug and Alcohol Dependence -- are seemingly OK. And some of those retired NFL players are taking action: 1,300 former NFL players filed a lawsuit in May 2015 alleging that NFL teams pumped them full of painkillers without regard to their overall health. Getting back on the field was, apparently, more important. Playing and staying healthy is important, especially in the NFL, where non-guaranteed contracts and a massive player pool can put any player out of the league because of one injury. But the off-field rewards reaped by staying on the field are in no way worth picking up a dangerous addiction.As more and more players join Monroe and Carroll's call to the NFL to reconsider marijuana, one can only hope that the league is indeed listening to its players, retired and active, whose message is rather clear: Stop preventing us from taking safer painkilling drugs. It's a common sense idea that seems too progressive for the league, but if the NFL truly cares about its players' well-being, they'll listen to Monroe, even if he remains out of football. "

Another issue, however, has been pushed to the forefront by active and retired NFL players, but it's also affected Americans outside of football: painkiller or opioid addiction.The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services issued an opioid overdose epidemic public health alert in 2014, but in football circles, trainers and doctors still give their injured players potentially addicting painkillers. NFL offensive lineman Eugene Monroe, whose contract was terminated on Wednesday by the Baltimore Ravens, has openly decried football's painkiller crisis and instead advocates for non-addictive cannabinoids.While recovering from a January shoulder surgery, Monroe wrote a personal essay about using marijuana versus opioids, donated $80,000 to medical marijuana researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Pennsylvania, started his own website to centralize his efforts, and influenced the NFL enough to have its top doctors speak to the aforementioned researchers to learn about their work. All of this, done in one offseason!The Ravens' weren't impressed, though. Their apparent discomfort with Monroe's pro-marijuana stance has led him to ponder whether his advocacy had anything to do with his release. Just days before his release was made official, Monroe made a very public health- and safety-angled point to the Ravens: You don't want me around because I'm trying to fix how we're cared for.

But a new kind of menu label has been proven to help us eat less, or at least choose less caloric food, when deciding what to order for takeout. The ""traffic light"" label -- which color-codes menu items as green, yellow or red based on calorie content -- helped people order meals with less calories in a new study of online ordering systems.For the study, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania had almost 250 corporate employees order their food from new online cafeteria system for six weeks. When faced with either traffic light labeling or a numeric calorie count on the menu, the employees ordered dishes with about 10 percent fewer calories than those who received regular menus without nutritional information.There are no plans to incorporate the traffic light into U.S. menus just yet. But U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it will start requiring food delivery systems, restaurants and more to put calorie counts on their menus next year, Science Daily notes. Until then, there's good, old-fashioned listening to your body, which will usually steer you in the right direction. "

A clear majority of the AFL-CIO's member unions had already endorsed the likely Democratic nominee on their own, many as early as last year.But the surprisingly close primary challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) led several major unions to wait out the endorsement process, while a handful chose to back the self-described democratic socialist over Clinton. The former Secretary of State finally secured the necessary support from member unions after her insurmountable delegate lead recently made her the presumptive nominee.""Hillary Clinton is a proven leader who shares our values,” the AFL-CIO's president, Richard Trumka, said in a statement. ""Throughout the campaign, she has demonstrated a strong commitment to the issues that matter to working people, and our members have taken notice. The activism of working people has already been a major force in this election and is now poised to elect Hillary Clinton and move America forward.""Although most unions had already declared their support for a particular candidate, the AFL-CIO typically does not wade into contested primaries. Instead, it waits until the nomination is more or less buttoned up. A large contingent of fervent Sanders supporters within organized labor -- many of whom criticized their own unions for backing Clinton -- gave the federation yet another reason to wait until his rival had become the presumptive nominee.It was inevitable that the AFL-CIO would back whoever was the eventual Democratic nominee over real estate mogul Donald Trump, who's expected to be named the GOP nominee next month at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Trumka has been carrying out a full-throated assault on Trump for months, calling him an ""anti-American bigot,” whose policies would hurt the working class.Unions consider it imperative that a Republican not succeed President Barack Obama. Organized labor has in recent years sustained legislative attacks in states around the country and on Capitol Hill, where a Republican-controlled Congress controlled has tried for years to weaken them. A White House occupied by a Democrat has been one of labor's few checks against legislation hostile to unions' interests. Trump has voiced support for right-to-work laws, which are anathema to unions. He has mostly said he opposes a minimum wage hike.In a statement on the Clinton endorsement, Trump said the AFL-CIO ""has made clear that it no longer represents American workers.""""Instead they have become part of the rigged system in Washington, D.C., that benefits only the insiders,"" Trump said. ""I believe their members will be voting for me in much larger numbers than for her.""Organized labor does not hold as much political power as it used to; the rate of union membership in the U.S. private sector now stands at just 6.7 percent, hovering near a historic low. But unions still run a considerable ground game during elections, and the Democratic nominee can expect to benefit from the AFL-CIO's advertising buys and get-out-the-vote efforts. The federation's affiliated super PAC, Workers Voice, spent $22 million during the 2012 cycle, according to the Center for Responsible Politics. This post has been updated with a statement from Trump."

""Heartbreaking may be the best way to describe it -- heartbreaking, frustrating and debilitating. It's not something I would wish on anyone.""While authorities have yet to find Cranston or his remains, they are no longer treating the case as a missing person investigation.""Until the cause of his disappearance can be determined, the investigation is being treated as a homicide investigation,"" Kingman deputy police Chief Rusty Cooper said in a Wednesday press release. ""This investigation has been a high priority and we are determined to solve his disappearance and bring to justice those who may be responsible.""On the day of his disappearance -- June 16, 2015 -- Cranston told friends he had business to take care of and that he'd be attending a meeting later that day with the Kingman City Council regarding a sewage permit for one of his properties.Cranston, an engineer by trade, owned Done Right Engineering. He also held the deeds to nearly 50 properties in northwestern Arizona. Most were purchased at tax sales. Some were fixer-uppers that he planned to renovate and flip.Cranston never showed up for the meeting and failed to return to a friend's home that night, prompting a missing person report with police.The investigation into Cranston's disappearance revealed that his phone had pinged a tower near the Hualapai Mountains on the afternoon of his disappearance. The area of those pings is where police and volunteers have been focusing much of their search efforts.""I have personally gone out 10 times and searched,"" said Chris Cranston, who often travels from his home in New York to assist in the investigation. ""I'd say we've covered several square miles at this point and have been able to eliminate most of those areas. We still don't have Sid, so I don't know how many more times we will have to do it, but we'll do whatever it takes.""Al Blanco, a local who helped manage Cranston's property rentals, told police he had lunch with Cranston on the day of his disappearance at a property Blanco was working on in the 1700 block of Club Avenue. It's the same property where Cranston's motorcycle was found after his disappearance.While police are not revealing many details, Arizona's ABC 15 News reported last year that Blanco's cell phone pinged the same tower Cranston's did on the day of his disappearance. Police have declined to say what significance this has, if any.In the days that followed Cranston's disappearance, his ex-wife, Jody Nelson, said she received an unexpected visit from the police.""They had two pictures of rings that had been sold at a pawn shop the day after Sid disappeared, and they wanted to know if I could identify them,"" Nelson told HuffPost in November. ""I was able to identify the one ring as Sid's wedding band. He had changed it over to his right hand after we got divorced, but still wore the ring because he liked it and it was worth money.""Chris said authorities know who sold his brother's rings. However, investigators have yet to release that information.""We have not publicly named any suspects at this time, but there are people we are interested in,"" FBI Special Agent Desirae Tolhurst told HuffPost. Tolhurst's agency recently began assisting local police in the investigation.Cranston's disappearance remains a mystery, and his brother has tried everything he can think of to locate him. In addition to assisting in search efforts, Chris hired a private investigator, launched an awareness campaign on social media and took his brother's story and pictures to the media in hope that someone, somewhere, might have information.But investigators still have no idea where Cranston -- who would now be 41 -- is today.""The problem searching at this point is, it's possible we've walked right over him and don't even know it,"" Chris said. ""With the passage of time, even with dogs it becomes difficult to find someone if they're buried.""Chris Cranston is urging anyone with information that could solve the case -- including the person or persons responsible -- to come forward.""Own your actions, clear your conscience and take responsibility,"" he said. ""Do the right thing and help our family before it's too late.""""They're going to solve this case, and they're going to be coming for you,"" he went on. ""It's going to be a hell of a lot easier if you do the right thing now, because it's only going to get worse. Sooner or later you're going to pay the piper.""The Cranston family has started a GoFundMe page to help cover their search expenses. They've also created a Facebook page to share updates on those efforts.Sid Cranston is described as being 5 feet 9 inches and 162 pounds, with brown hair, blue eyes and light facial hair. He was last seen wearing a gray ball cap, prescription glasses, a white, sleeveless T-shirt, blue jeans and multicolored tennis shoes.Anyone with information on this case is asked to call the Kingman Police Department at 928-753-1911 or Silent Witness at 928-753-1234. Silent Witness and the Cranston family have offered cash rewards for information."

Olympian or no, he’s still a creep. A creep who posted, on Snapchat, a photo of American gymnast Carly Patterson -- a close-up of her butt -- with the caption, “my sport has its moments.” As if that weren't bad enough, the photo was taken when Patterson, now 28, was only 16.The photo is from the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, where Patterson became only the second American woman ever to win All-Around Gold at the Olympics.When people objected to the objectification of a minor -- a minor who was, and still is, a much more accomplished athlete than Smith is, by the way -- he deleted the photo. When people continued to raise objections, Smith insisted that he’d only apologize if Patterson herself said she was offended.Uh, Louis, I don’t think people were objecting to the idea that gymnastics gets you in great shape. They were objecting to the fact that you zoomed in on a photo of a teenage girl’s butt and ogled it, then encouraged thousands of people to do the same.Women -- and girls -- do not do gymnastics for men's sexual amusement. They do it because it's the closest a human can get to being a superhero. It's bad enough that a female gymnast can get a deduction for pulling her leotard out of her butt should it creep up there in the middle of a routine. Now, female gymnasts have to deal with their male peers turning them into sex objects for their followers' consumption, too? But Smith wasn’t done. After people continued to object to his response, he tweeted at Patterson, marveling at what a big day it had been, and joking they should do it again, or something.Patterson then apologized to him, seemingly for how much heat he was taking, and reassured her followers that they’re friends.That’s right: She apologized to him. He objectified her, then laughed off the criticism, arguing that it only counted as sexism -- and thus worth apologizing for -- if she was upset by it. Then, he publicly pressured her to be cool about it so that he wouldn’t have to apologize. And ended up getting an apology himself. From the woman whose teenage butt he’d been publicly, creepily ogling.It was a perfectly stuck dismount.

Olympian or no, he’s still a creep. A creep who posted, on Snapchat, a photo of American gymnast Carly Patterson -- a close-up of her butt -- with the caption, “my sport has its moments.” As if that weren't bad enough, the photo was taken when Patterson, now 28, was only 16.The photo is from the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, where Patterson became only the second American woman ever to win All-Around Gold at the Olympics.When people objected to the objectification of a minor -- a minor who was, and still is, a much more accomplished athlete than Smith is, by the way -- he deleted the photo. When people continued to raise objections, Smith insisted that he’d only apologize if Patterson herself said she was offended.Uh, Louis, I don’t think people were objecting to the idea that gymnastics gets you in great shape. They were objecting to the fact that you zoomed in on a photo of a teenage girl’s butt and ogled it, then encouraged thousands of people to do the same.Women -- and girls -- do not do gymnastics for men's sexual amusement. They do it because it's the closest a human can get to being a superhero. It's bad enough that a female gymnast can get a deduction for pulling her leotard out of her butt should it creep up there in the middle of a routine. Now, female gymnasts have to deal with their male peers turning them into sex objects for their followers' consumption, too? But Smith wasn’t done. After people continued to object to his response, he tweeted at Patterson, marveling at what a big day it had been, and joking they should do it again, or something.Patterson then apologized to him, seemingly for how much heat he was taking, and reassured her followers that they’re friends.That’s right: She apologized to him. He objectified her, then laughed off the criticism, arguing that it only counted as sexism -- and thus worth apologizing for -- if she was upset by it. Then, he publicly pressured her to be cool about it so that he wouldn’t have to apologize. And ended up getting an apology himself. From the woman whose teenage butt he’d been publicly, creepily ogling.It was a perfectly stuck dismount. An international judging panel of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Woody Allen and Bill Cosby would give this routine an Olympic gold medal. It would be Smith’s first."

A medical exam performed at the University of Toronto and the Canadian Concussion Center revealed that he suffered from the brain disease Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), according to The New York Times.“Dave was very competitive in all aspects of life. When didn’t succeed, he worked hard,"" he said. ""However, CTE was too much for him to overcome.""Mike Mirra's speech starts at 19:58CTE can only be identified after a medical examination has been performed on the brain after death. The cause of the disease is linked to repeated instances of head trauma and has become a rising issue in sports. Concussion protocol has become a bigger focus in nearly every major sport, especially the NFL. A 2015 PBS report showed that 87 of 91 former NFL players tested positive for CTE. Now, it seems that BMX is beginning to see the physical toll that its sport can place on its athletes. "

Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said the Orlando shooting likely influenced lawmakers' decision to reject an amendment he has sponsored for the last three years.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5762f6252200002d00f81676.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In what could signal a new shift in Congress, House lawmakers rejected a proposal on Thursday that would have required the government to get a warrant to search certain foreign surveillance databases for information on U.S. citizens.The House rejected the amendment to the defense appropriations bills by a margin of 198-222. Lawmakers had adopted the proposal with a 255-174 vote in 2015 and an even more overwhelming vote of 293-123 in 2014, though the language was stripped both times in government spending deals.Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), the sponsor of the amendment the last three years, said he thought there were two reasons the proposal failed on Thursday. ""I think it was about Orlando and a stronger disinformation campaign from the committee,"" he said, referring to a letter from Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) that criticized the amendment.""We had a stiff headwind,"" Massie continued. ""But I think the winds will eventually change, and we'll prevail one day.""The Orlando shooting became a key point in the debate over the amendment on Wednesday, as lawmakers argued what effect Massie's legislation would have on the investigation into the attack on the LGBT nightclub Pulse.Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), who said he rose ""to oppose the Massie amendment and the inaccurate accusations that underly it,"" argued that if the proposal were in effect today, the intelligence community would be unable to search the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act database for information on the deceased Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen. FISA is a law used to collect data on foreigners, but the National Security Agency dragnet also catches information on U.S. citizens who interact with those foreigners.""We should be focused on thwarting terrorist attacks,"" Stewart said Wednesday, ""not on thwarting the ability of intelligence professionals to investigate and stop them.""House Judiciary Chairman Robert Goodlatte (R-Va.) voiced similar concerns. ""This amendment prohibits the government from searching data already in its possession, collected lawfully under section 702 of FISA, to determine whether Omar Mateen was in contact with foreign terrorists overseas,"" Goodlatte said, as Massie shook his head in disagreement. Massie said it was ""a complete mischaracterization"" to claim that the government wouldn't be able to search FISA databases for information on Mateen, and urged lawmakers not to fall for that argument. ""You obviously can get a warrant on the perpetrator of this crime,"" he said.The spirited debate continued even after the House had moved on. Stewart and Massie exchanged words in the back of the chamber, and at one point, Stewart aggressively grabbed Massie's arm to prevent him from walking away.Asked about the exchange after, Massie told The Huffington Post that he had said to Stewart, ""Get your hands off me!""""I almost went Charlton Heston on him,"" Massie said.While opponents of the amendment seemed to focus on the effect it would have on the Orlando probe, the real crux of the debate seems to be the appropriate threshold for accessing information on U.S. citizens. Critics objected to Massie's amendment years ago over concerns that it overly restricted searches of the FISA database. Massie responded by adding explicit language to the amendment to clarify that the government could access information collected under FISA if it has probable cause to search or if someone commits a crime.Making intelligence agents get a warrant to search for information collected under FISA could slow them down and limit the searches they make. But Massie contends that his amendment, which was co-sponsored by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), is just codifying the Fourth Amendment.The House, this year at least, didn't seem to agree.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly listed Thursday's vote tally as 198-242. The correct tally was 198-222."
