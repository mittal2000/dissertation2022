0,POLITICS,Voters Don't Think Any Of The 2016 Candidates Would Make Great Presidents,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-election-candidates-poll_us_569ff2dde4b076aadcc50a0a,Expectations are low for this year's crop of presidential hopefuls.,2016-01-20,"GOP candidates participate in the Republican presidential debate on Jan. 14, 2016. Voters say they aren't too excited about them or their Democratic rivals.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a008f02a00002c00030f2d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"American voters' overall reaction to the field of 2016 presidential candidates is a resounding ""Eh.""In a survey released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center, voters were more likely to say that each of the nine leading candidates would make either a ""poor"" or ""terrible"" president than a ""great"" or ""good"" one.Just over one-third of respondents thought that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would do well as president, while an even lower percentage rated the other candidates positively.Voters on either side of the aisle are actually pretty optimistic about their own leading candidates, however. A majority of Democrats have high hopes for the presidency of either Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Most Republicans expect Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and business mogul Donald Trump to make America ... well, at least good again. They're less sold on more establishment-friendly GOP contenders, giving former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich net negative ratings. But, according to the Pew report, both Democrats and Republicans dislike all of the other party's candidates, expressing enough animosity to drag everyone's ratings down. Democrats are especially hostile toward Trump -- 64 percent say he'd be a terrible president, compared to the 26 percent or less who think any of the other Republicans would be terrible. Republicans, meanwhile, dislike Sanders but loathe Clinton, with 57 percent saying she'd make a terrible POTUS.Pew surveyed 1,525 registered voters between Jan. 7 and Jan. 14, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones.Also on HuffPost:"

3,POLITICS,Justice Ginsburg Leads Supreme Court Majority To Deliver Blow To Big Business,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ruth-bader-ginsburg-supreme-court-big-business_us_569fb4d2e4b0fca5ba762275,Corporations won't be able to head off class action lawsuits by simply making a money offer to plaintiffs.,2016-01-20,Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the lead opinion in a case that sought to curtail class action lawsuits against corporations.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569fb5841a00002d00ab0efd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday issued the first decision in a series of class action cases this term that are widely viewed as attempts by business interests to shut the courthouse door to consumers and everyday plaintiffs.In a 6-to-3 opinion in Campbell-Ewald v. Gomez, a case testing the limits on federal courts considering class-action disputes, the justices ruled that businesses can't just ""moot"" a case by simply offering to settle it with the person who first brought it -- let alone if the person rejected the offer.Relying on contractual principles, Ginsburg said such offers have ""no force.""""Like other unaccepted contract offers, it creates no lasting right or obligation,"" Ginsburg said. ""With the offer off the table, and the defendant's continuing denial of liability, adversity between the parties persists.""That adversity matters because, under the Constitution, federal courts can only hear actual ""cases"" or ""controversies."" But Campbell-Ewald -- a marketing firm that was sued for sending unwanted mass text messages -- said that requirement evaporated after it offered José Gómez, the lead plaintiff in the dispute, some money to make his case go away.Gómez had sued Campbell-Ewald, a Navy contractor, for a text message he received from the company recruiting him to join the Navy. But because he was almost 40 at the time and he never consented to receiving the text, Gómez alleged in his lawsuit that the company violated a federal law that forbids ""unsolicited advertisement."" But he didn't want to just go it alone -- he wanted to form a class action against the firm.It was at that point that Campbell-Ewald sought to make Gómez whole by simply making him an offer it thought he wouldn't resist: a sum of $1,503, or about three times what federal law allowed him to recover. Gómez, however, refused to settle and said he wanted to press forward as the leader of the class action.Ginsburg said that was good enough for his claim to remain active in the courts.A person who is ""a would-be class representative with a live claim of her own must be accorded a fair opportunity to show"" that she can vindicate the interests of others in the class, she said.Practically, this detail is important for the vitality of class actions, which depend on the willingness of people like Gómez to become the public face of a lawsuit. If this person or ""class representative"" somehow falls out of the case -- by virtue of accepting a settlement offer or other circumstances -- the whole class action runs the risk of falling apart. And not just any plaintiff is ready to act as a backup in federal court.Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito, said the court's ruling Wednesday ""hands it to the plaintiff,"" but seemed to hint that all may not be lost for corporations and other defendants seeking tactical end-runs.He said that while a rejected offer to settle a case may not shut down a lawsuit altogether, that a ""payment of complete relief"" left with the court hearing the case may otherwise take the plaintiff out of the equation and effectively extinguish the case.Calling this ""good news"" for defendants, Roberts all but invited a future case examining that possibility.""This Court leaves that question for another day,"" he wrote, ""assuming there are other plaintiffs out there who, like Gomez, won't take 'yes' for an answer."""
4,POLITICS,Black Lives Matter Protesters Call For Justice At U.S. Mayors Conference,Julia Craven and Tyler Tynes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-mayors-conference_us_569fcc9ee4b0a7026bf9e0be,"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Flint Mayor Karen Weaver and Baltimore’s Stephanie Rawlings-Blake were in attendance.",2016-01-20,"April Goggans, 36, was one of several Black Lives Matter protesters who attended the Conference of Mayors on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569fccd02a00002c00030e73.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake was delivering the opening remarks for the 2016 United States Conference of Mayors on Wednesday, April Goggans sprinted up in front of the podium.Goggans, 36, was one of several Black Lives Matter activists who wanted to voice their opinions about issues plaguing black communities at the protest, which was organized by Black Lives Matter DMV, the DC chapter of the Black Youth Project and Baltimore BLOC. She came equipped with a sign reading “16 Shots & A Cover Up #LaquanMcDonald #ResignRahm,” a reference to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the recent release of a video showing unarmed black teen Laquan McDonald being shot and killed by a white police officer. Since the video was made public, there have been calls from activists and black Chicagoans for Emanuel to resign. The crux of Goggans' protest was simple and true to the goals of most Black Lives Matter protests: to make people feel uncomfortable and force others to acknowledge issues in black communities. “Them getting together as mayors doesn’t do anything for the millions of people left back in their cities dealing with what they deal with everyday. This is like a fantasy world. It’s Disneyland. They’re living this [fantasy] ... with their suits and their coffee,” she told The Huffington Post.She said multiple white mayors standing behind the podium spoke of her like she wasn’t even there. Asserting her blackness was making white people uncomfortable, Goggans said.“You could hear everything they were saying. There were white mayors to my left who were totally disgusted. They spoke about me nastily,” she said. “But some mayors walked by and said that I was incredibly brave and to keep it up. I’m over whether or not I make people uncomfortable. It’s the comfort that allowed them to come here when things going on in their cities are going on.”Goggans said inviting Rawlings-Blake and Emmanuel to speak about community policing was a slap in the face. No mayors should want them to be speaking about police-community relations and safety in communities of color, she argued.Shai Crawley, a 20-year-old resident of Baltimore, held a sign describing how he believed Rawlings-Blake had failed Charm City. As mayors left for the next panel session, he stepped to the podium and grabbed the microphone.“Let this be a reminder: We will not be silenced. We will not bow down. We will not go away until our voices as people, as citizens, as human beings, as black bodies in this city are heard,” Crawley said. “We will be here. This is our community. And until we stand up as a people, things like this will continue to happen.” Crawley stopped for a moment. He pointed to a red USCM button featuring a slogan that read “Invest and protect,” balking at the phrase.“Stuff like this? It doesn’t happen in our communities. Nobody's investing in our communities. Nobody's protecting our communities. If so, we wouldn’t have been here today,” he said. In the back of the crowded room, protester Duane “Shorty” Davis held court with several onlookers and reporters. His message was the loudest. Davis, a middle-aged black Baltimore resident, said he doesn't support 2016 Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. He, too, wants Emanuel to step down, and he isn’t a fan of his city’s elected officials.Davis told HuffPost he came out to protest police killings of unarmed black men in Baltimore. He carried a sign with the names of black men shot by police -- Keith Davis, Tyrone West, Anthony Anderson, Maurice Donald Johnson -- asking “Who’s next?”“You pushing blacks out of Baltimore so all they do is clean your bathrooms and fix your beds, cut your grass. There’s no careers in Baltimore for black people -- just jobs,” Davis said, citing the increased development of the city’s inner harbor area under Rawlings-Blake. The money could have been used to provide the city’s black community with better affordable housing, he said.Since 2012, more than 6,800 renters and their families have been evicted in the city annually, according to a report the Public Justice Center released in December. The city has the nation's second-highest percentage of renters facing eviction due to an inability to pay rent. Only Detroit has more renters in danger of losing their homes.While the U.S. Census Bureau reports that there are 46,800 vacant homes in Baltimore, city officials only count 16,745, which includes properties considered uninhabitable but excludes thousands of homes that are livable but empty.“In 2016, we gonna bring attention to everything that’s wrong in Baltimore until they get it right,” Davis said. “[The conference] is just a dog and pony show. When [Rawlings-Blake] shows up and talks about how glamorous the city is -- she needs to start talking about the blight in the community.” Rawlings-Blake, who is currently USCM president, did not directly address comments from protesters during the conference. However, some mayors made an effort to stop security from removing them from the event. One mayor shouted, ""That's what we're here for. Black lives do matter.""Steven Hernandez, the mayor of Coachella, California, was one mayor who supported protesters on Wednesday. He enjoyed their mode of civic engagement, he said.“When folks take to protest, it’s usually because there’s recognition of some type of social uneasiness, some type of problem within our society,” he told HuffPost. “There’s no doubt that when you look at the urban core … black lives, brown lives -- we’ve been effected,” Hernandez added. Coachella is over 96 percent Hispanic. Hernandez cited unemployment, high incarceration and murder rates as some of the city's main challenges -- problems that are often prevalent in areas where people of color comprise a large percentage of the population. Policymakers should “not be afraid to really look at what the root causes are,” he said.“You can’t do like an ostrich and put your head in the ground and pretend that it’s gonna go away. You gotta address it head on, and I’m hoping that they’re addressing it head on,” he said, referencing Rawlings-Blake and Karen Weaver, the mayor of Flint, Michigan. Former USCM President Michael Nutter walked into the fray as the protests reached their climax. As a former mayor of Philadelphia, a city that’s over 44 percent black, he's seen his share of Black Lives Matter protests before, during and after his tenure.“There are some serious issues in the United States of America that have to be addressed,” Nutter told HuffPost. “I would strongly urge all the parties to ... develop a list of specific goals and specific actions,"" he added. ""Then ... report back out to communities all across this country about what progress is being made and what steps still need to be taken.""When the mayors dispersed, protesters continued to speak with lingering audience members and reporters. They’d come this far, they said, and they weren’t going anywhere. Even the security guards attempting to clear the premises knew about Davis, the big voice in the room.“Aye, man. Ask security about me,” Davis said with a smile, fixing his hat and pointing to a heckler. “They know me in here. I’m from Baltimore. I got a room. And checkout ain’t 'til 3 o’clock.” Correction:  An earlier version of this story included Keith Davis in a list of men shot and killed by police. He was shot and wounded, but not killed. The article has also been amended to reflect that the group Stop Police Terror issued a statement of solidarity but did not participate in Wednesday's protest."

Former USCM President Michael Nutter walked into the fray as the protests reached their climax. As a former mayor of Philadelphia, a city that’s over 44 percent black, he's seen his share of Black Lives Matter protests before, during and after his tenure.“There are some serious issues in the United States of America that have to be addressed,” Nutter told HuffPost. “I would strongly urge all the parties to ... develop a list of specific goals and specific actions,"" he added. ""Then ... report back out to communities all across this country about what progress is being made and what steps still need to be taken.""When the mayors dispersed, protesters continued to speak with lingering audience members and reporters. They’d come this far, they said, and they weren’t going anywhere. Even the security guards attempting to clear the premises knew about Davis, the big voice in the room.“Aye, man. Ask security about me,” Davis said with a smile, fixing his hat and pointing to a heckler. “They know me in here. I’m from Baltimore. I got a room. And checkout ain’t 'til 3 o’clock.” Correction:  An earlier version of this story included Keith Davis in a list of men shot and killed by police. He was shot and wounded, but not killed. The article has also been amended to reflect that the group Stop Police Terror issued a statement of solidarity but did not participate in Wednesday's protest."

They shed their jackets, gloves and belts, shivering as they wait to pass through a metal detector and send their backpacks through an x-ray machine. School safety agents stand nearby, poised to step in if the alarm bleats.It’s an everyday occurrence for more than 100,000 middle and high school students across the city.On this morning, as on every school day, senior Justin Feldeo prepares to be pulled aside for separate screening by a hand wand. Feldeo is studying to be a firefighter and the boots he wears for class trigger the metal detectors.Fifteen minutes after the formal start of the school day, students are still pouring in, even later for having to go through the machines.Almost as many New York City students run the gauntlet of x-ray machines each day as pass through the scanners at busy Miami International Airport. And the procedure is numbingly similar. Students must remove belts, shoes, and sometimes bobby pins as the wait stretches as long as an hour.A ProPublica survey found that the daily ritual is borne disproportionately by students of color; black and Hispanic students in high school are nearly three times more likely to walk through a metal detector than their white counterparts.Nearly 21 years after a fearful city installed them at the front doors of more than 80 schools, there are growing questions about whether the security precautions do more harm than good. Today, by ProPublica and WNYC’s count, students at more than 236 New York City schools are required to pass through metal detectors.“There are a lot of things that are done in the name of student safety that don’t view the students as the people who need to be protected, but view the students as the people somebody else needs to be protected from,” said Jill Bloomberg, principal of Park Slope Collegiate, a secondary school with 423 students in grades 6 through 12. She is trying to get the scanners removed from her building in Brooklyn.The metal detectors were first installed in the early 1990s when crime rates were much higher and have stayed in place even as crime in the public schools has fallen 48 percent over the past 10 years. Crime in schools in the last year alone has fallen 11 percent, according to the New York Police Department.Since 1998, only two permanent metal detectors have been removed. And their necessity appears almost never re-evaluated: The scanners have remained after the schools in which they were installed shut down and entirely new schools opened in the same buildings.And while some principals say the security measures provide a critical line of defense at schools with particularly volatile mixes of students, few believe more than 200 New York City schools still meet this bar.In a report called “Security With Dignity,” a task force created by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio recommended last July that the city remove some metal detectors. The NYPD agreed to study the issue, but has provided no timeline. And nearly six months later, the Department of Education has yet to publicize criteria for removing them.A spokeswoman for the Department of Education would not comment on a plan for removing the metal detectors. “We will continue to ensure students are in safe environments where they can learn and succeed,” said Toya Holness, a deputy press secretary.The recommendations have faced stiff opposition from the union which represents the New York City school district’s over 5,000 safety agents, who are technically part of the NYPD.“‘Security with dignity,’” said Greg Floyd, the head of Teamsters Local 237. “I don’t know how you have the two in the same sentence.”Floyd said the metal detectors are working as an effective deterrent and warned that the task force should be wary about cheering their removal. “In this case, they better very well hope they work, because if they don’t, then they all have problems,” he said.And Floyd brushed aside the complaints that the scanners are used primarily in schools serving low-income black and Hispanic students. Children from those neighborhoods, he said, often require them.“Would I say, put metal detectors in Brooklyn Tech? I would not,” Floyd said, because the students there, “some from affluent neighborhoods,” are “committed to learning, they’re not committed to fighting. That’s not the case in every New York City public school, and you can’t say, ‘Treat the children the same’ because we don’t do that.”Despite the widespread use of the scanners, the amount of contraband found is low. In the approximately three million scans conducted in the first two months of this school year, only a tiny number of contraband items were discovered, according to a NYPD document obtained by ProPublica. Among the 126 possible weapons seized at schools that scan daily — some found hidden on school grounds, others by scanners — were an unloaded handgun, 73 knives, 21 boxcutters, three BB guns and an assortment of loose bullets and razor blades.Some school officials believe the daily security checks actually lead to behavior problems among the students. Until recently, Tyler Brewster was a dean of discipline and a math teacher at the School for Democracy and Leadership in Brooklyn, which has metal detectors. She now works at The James Baldwin High School in Manhattan, which does not. Brewster said she doesn’t believe students at either school should be forced to go through the scanners, and that it brands whole groups of students as untrustworthy.“We didn’t have to go through the metal detectors as teachers, and I’m no less or more human than our students. Why do you trust me to have a bad day and handle it the right way versus the kid having the bad day?” Brewster said. “I wonder how much of the tone is set by having metal detectors in the first place.”Kamaya Sanders, a student at the Secondary School for Journalism in Brooklyn, said that she sometimes felt suspicious of her fellow students as they stood in line to get checked.“Sometimes you want to say your school's safe, but you have the metal detectors, so you never know. Then let’s say someone in front of you gets stopped, then you’re like, ‘Oh, they may have something.’ You get scared,” Sanders said. “It does make you feel safe in a way, but sometimes it’s not worth it.”At Democracy and Leadership, Brewster said, the scanning led to daily altercations, some of which have ended with arrests.“There were maybe 3,000 students in my building and every single person had to be scanned,” she said. “On rainy days, the kids were gonna have to wait in line. In some cases, they had to take their shoes off, but the floors were wet so then there would be an argument between the safety agents about not taking their shoes off, and then not being allowed into the building and then that would escalate.”The dilemma of the scanners is on display at a massive brick building in the heart of Park Slope in Brooklyn. The building, which takes up an entire city block, once housed a single high school, John Jay, with a tumultuous reputation. Now four new schools share the building. One of the schools, Park Slope Collegiate, would like to remove the metal detectors, the others don’t.Bloomberg, Collegiate’s principal, said the neighborhood, which is now filled with trendy shops and restaurants, has changed significantly and that fights or weapons in the building are now rare.For reasons the NYPD did not explain, the John Jay campus was not among the school sites listed as having a metal detector, so it was unclear if any weapons had been recovered from the building in the first two months of the school year.The metal detectors send a message to the students that “we don’t trust you. And even if we trusted you, we don’t necessarily trust the guy behind you.” That message, she said, runs counter to what her school is trying to teach and “it’s alienating.”Bloomberg said she has been against the metal detectors since she became principal at the school a dozen years ago. She said her colleagues, the principals at the other schools, are worried that something could happen if the metal detectors are removed.“It’s very hard to have a rational conversation when you’re talking about the possibility of something happening,” Bloomberg said. “They make a lot of people feel safe: it doesn’t mean they make them safe and it doesn’t mean that they’ve considered what they give up.”The story of how New York City came to install metal detectors at middle and high schools across the city traces to a February morning in 1992.It wasn’t even 10 a.m. before two students were shot to death at Thomas Jefferson High School in the East New York section of Brooklyn. By the afternoon, a third teen had died after accidentally shooting himself in his house.That day, everything that could have gone wrong did. Then-Mayor David Dinkins had been scheduled to address the Jefferson students as a preventive measure after a separate shooting at the school killed a 16-year-old boy two months earlier. After that shooting, the school began performing security scans on students with hand-held devices. But on the day of the mayor’s visit, principal Carol Burt-Beck called off the scans, convinced they would send the wrong message to students. Fifteen security guards and police officers were present in the school. That morning, gunfire erupted just a few feet away from them.The city was quick to respond. The Board of Education approved a $20-million plan to install metal detectors, x-rays and electromagnetic doors at an additional 40 schools, vastly expanding a program that had involved just 16 schools, usually large and in the most crime-ridden areas of the city.In the years that followed, the installation of metal detectors became the answer to every new slashing or stabbing. Twenty more schools added them in 1993, bringing the total to 81.The rise in serious incidents at the city’s schools in the 1990s ran counter to the city’s dropping crime rate. Over the 1991 school year, 3,193 weapons were confiscated in public schools, 189 of them firearms. The following year, violent incidents in schools rose 16 percent to 5,761.Dinkins, up for re-election against Rudy Giuliani, who was campaigning on a “tough on crime” platform, put police officers in all of the city’s then 1,069 schools where they have remained ever since.Over the next three years the city steadily added metal detectors to its schools. By 2003, 88 middle schools and high schools had them. Some of these schools have since been replaced by multiple smaller schools, yet the scanners remain.Thus far, none of these schools has removed the metal detectors outright and the current plan includes a gradual reduction in use. NYPD Assistant Chief Brian Conroy, of the School Safety Division, said the police can reduce scanning in a school to three or two days, then even further to random scanning.One Bronx building, called JHS 113 Richard R. Green, that houses four middle schools, has already reduced its scanning, so far without ill effects, according to an assistant principal at one of the schools.“The chancellor came to the building in the fall, and noticed it was a pretty calm place,” said Dr. Marvin Jennings, assistant principal at The Forward School. “Kids were in classrooms. Teachers were teaching. Learning was happening. It added to the feeling and sentiment that daily scanning was not necessary, and could be scaled back.”The Forward School is emerging from a rocky past. Since 2012, it has been labelled a “persistently dangerous’’ school by state officials and has had four different principals in five years. But Jennings said the environment has improved and that kids feel safer in the school even with less scanning. The NYPD data obtained by ProPublica notes only two items found on site during the first two months of the school year, a knife and a “tool” found in a flowerpot outside the school.For Jennings, what matters most is the students’ mindset as they go through the detectors.“It won’t be the first time they get scanned, it won’t be the first time that someone looks at them in a way that’s less than complimentary” because of race, gender or ethnicity, he said. “Helping them learn how to cope with that, and seeing themselves as bigger than the opinion of another man or woman is what I think gets them through.”One of the few school buildings that has managed to remove the scanners, the former Eastern District High School in Brooklyn, did so by enlisting students in the effort to quell violence. In 2006, the high school was on its way to be shut down and replaced by three smaller schools in the same building. The three new principals joined forces with elected local officials, parents and persuaded the Board of Education to remove the machines.“We came in as wide-eyed, idealistic, newbies, and we wanted to change things,” said William Jusino, principal of Progress High School, one of the schools that moved into the building. Eastern District, he said, used to have such a bad reputation as a “dumping ground for difficult children and staff” that local shops would close down when school got out only to reopen later. “We wanted to make sure that we avoided that,” Jusino said. “That we didn’t grow into that type of situation.”Jusino and the other principals took a stance that the metal detectors had to go even though everyone was “never 100 percent sure it was a good idea.” District officials gave the new schools their chance to rethink school safety.For the first two years, Jusino recalled, students were reminded on a daily basis: They were being trusted to not bring in weapons into the schools.“We’ve been on high alert ever since,” Jusino said, “You’ve gotta make sure that there isn’t a serious incident, god forbid, and how could you make sure? How could you guarantee that? You really can’t. What you could do is invest in your children.”The most serious challenge to the scanner-less approach came last January when two Progress High School students were shot in connection with gang activity a few blocks from the school. Deans ushered kids inside and pop-up metal detectors were stationed in the building.“Folks were genuinely afraid and anxious, and I understood it. I’m anxious every day,” Jusino said, recalling a emergency staff meeting at which several faculty members expressed their desire to have metal detectors back. “But the answer is not the machines, the answer’s the relationships. The answer’s giving kids options in the school.”“Weapons will get into the building without metal detectors. Weapons will get into a building with metal detectors,” Jusino said. “The idea is ‘What do you do. What programs do you do. What’s the trust and values you have in your school.’”This story was originally co-published by ProPublica and WNYC.Also on HuffPost:"

Yes? Maybe? Doesn't matter. Anything less than ""absolutely not"" shows you've been failed by higher education, and our country is therefore in a state of peril. Oh, and you probably don't understand the First Amendment, either. ""There is a crisis in American civic education,"" reads an alarmist press release for a study published by the right-leaning nonprofit American Council of Trustees and Alumni this month.The Judge Judy question comes from the ""Constitutional Survey"" conducted by the group in August to test college grads and the general population on basic constitutional and civic knowledge.""If 'Judith Sheindlin' is a name that could be confused with one of the justices, something's gone badly off,"" the group's vice president of policy, Michael Poliakoff, told HuffPost. Indeed, that's the part that many major publications focused on in reports about the poll. But before we decry the state of the American higher education system, let's take a look at the actual question:The majority of college grads, 61.6 percent, correctly chose Elena Kagan. The second-most selected option was Lawrence Warren Pierce, a former federal judge with a name that's relatively unknown to the general public.Almost as unknown is ""Judith Sheindlin,"" the real name of ""Judge Judy."" While the hugely popular, nationally syndicated TV judge's moniker has become somewhat of a household name, ""Judith Sheindlin"" is just another vaguely familiar name on a list. Studies like this show how pollsters can focus on relatively peripheral results to inflate their findings and call attention to their studies. Last month, another organization's survey showed Americans were divided over whether they wanted to bomb Agrabah, the fictional home of Aladdin. Most people said they weren't sure, but the fact that anyone fell for the trick was the widely reported ""troubling"" outcome.The American Council of Trustees and Alumni uses the results of its Judge Judy poll to argue that the ""culture of civic ignorance fuels student efforts to quash First Amendment rights and expunge historic figures from campus.""Some universities have been in turmoil over their handling of complaints of racism. Racial slurs and threats have become so prevalent that some students have publicly said they're uneasy about bigoted language being protected by the First Amendment.""We did draw the connection between the basic gaps in people's knowledge about the Constitution and specifically about what we're seeing on college campuses,"" Poliakoff said.But is 9.6 percent of people selecting the wrong answer to a multiple choice question about a different part of the Constitution really an indicator of campus ""civic ignorance"" that's leading to student calls for curbs on the First Amendment? In short, no. That's a serious stretch. A few people messed up a poll question. Big whoop. A wrong answer happens to belong to a TV judge, but no one seemed to care that more people wrongly opted for a real judge.This doesn't prove students are calling for increased safety on campus because they're ""out of touch"" with American history, or are incapable of understanding the First Amendment. The American Council of Trustees and Alumni's goal of empowering young people with comprehensive historical knowledge and holding universities accountable for providing this education is noble.But hyping a relatively irrelevant answer to a trick poll question doesn't prove the group's argument. It proves how easily polls can be twisted. Also on HuffPost:"

Schuette -- a Republican widely believed to have ambitions of running for governor in 2018 -- refused. ""Given the multiple reviews by federal and state agencies, and the pending and potential federal court actions, we do not believe it necessary to conduct an additional investigation,"" a Schuette staffer wrote on Dec. 22, almost three months after state Rep. Sheldon Neeley (D-Flint) sent his request. But in the weeks after Schuette refused to investigate, national media attention on Flint increased, and on Jan. 14, Republican Governor Rick Snyder asked President Barack Obama to declare a federal emergency. The next day, Schuette had changed his tune. He said that he would launch an investigation ""without fear or favor.""  Schuette already represents some of the same people his office could end up investigating. His office is defending state officials in a lawsuit in which Flint citizens allege that state and local government officials ignored evidence that the water pumped from the Flint River was toxic and caused serious injury. The lawsuit also names as defendants two of the state-appointed emergency managers who were in charge of Flint in 2014 and opted to use the Flint River as its water supply. Under state law, the attorney general has to represent emergency managers when they're sued, but the town the emergency manager ran has to cover the legal costs.""The people of Flint -- who have been forever harmed by a succession of state-appointed managers -- now have no fair legal recourse from someone who is supposed to be the people's lawyer,"" state Sen. Jim Ananich (D-Flint) said in an emailed statement.It's not unusual for state attorneys general to find themselves on different sides of the same case, said James Tierney, director of the National State Attorneys General Program at Columbia Law School.""Attorneys general do this all the time,"" Tierney told The Huffington Post. Without commenting on Michigan specifically, Tierney said attorneys general have a lot of options for mitigating the appearance of a conflict. They could bring in outside counsel to handle a case, or have different lawyers within their office handle defense and prosecution. Schuette's office did not comment on whether it has taken the latter approach.In high-profile cases such the Flint water crisis, the attorney general could be personally involved in both the investigation and the lawsuit, said Bruce Green, the director for the Louis Stein Center for Law and Ethics at Fordham Law School. Tierney pointed to a case in which the late Beau Biden, who was serving as Delaware's attorney general, abruptly switched from defending an embattled psychiatric center to investigating it. ""The way the system is set up, that happens quite frequently, where the attorney general has attorneys on both sides,"" said state Sen. Rick Jones (R). ""I certainly think the attorney general of Michigan should investigate everything that went on, and if there was anybody at the [Michigan Department of Environmental Quality] that changed information or covered up information, if it's criminal, then certainly the attorney general should take action.""Deborah LaBelle, an attorney for the plaintiffs suing Michigan, nonetheless questioned whether Schuette can conduct an independent investigation when he's defending the state against charges of wrongdoing. ""What is the attorney general doing investigating his clients?"" she asked. ""It doesn't even make sense.""Schuette's investigation only arrived when it was the ""popular thing to do,"" said Nic Clark, the Michigan director of Clean Water Action, which promotes clean, safe and affordable water. ""We want to know whose side is he really on.""""Bill Schuette’s biggest priority is Bill Schuette, so he will do whatever he thinks makes sense in his desire to succeed Rick Snyder as governor,"" said David Holtz, executive committee chair for the Michigan chapter of the Sierra Club, which called for an independent investigation in October. ""The least likely thing Bill Schuette will do is to mount an aggressive pursuit of the facts,"" he added. Schuette's office declined to provide comment for this story and would not say which Flint-related lawsuits the attorney general is defending. "

Coffman told The Cut that she was hanging out with a group of friends Monday night when they started talking about their experiences with creepy dudes and sexual harassment. ""I said, 'Why does nobody say anything?' And my friend just said people were scared and I was like, 'Well, I’m not scared,'"" Coffman told The Cut. ""So I just said his name."" In a series of tweets, Coffman accused Berru, music publicist and CEO of Life Or Death PR, of groping her butt and biting her hair. Coffman tweeted that she was at a bar in New York with four of her guy friends when Berru came over to the group and proceeded to grope Coffman without her consent. The Huffington Post reached out to Coffman for comment but did not hear back before the time of publication. Coffman said she didn't take it public because she was afraid of the backlash she might receive.""I told Domino Records and I told my friends and people who I knew but I guess I didn’t really think to take it public,"" she told The Cut. ""And it wasn’t until now that I realized that I was actually kind of scared to in a way.""After Coffman came forward with her story, she quickly gained support from other women and fellow musicians. Shortly after Coffman came forward, more women tweeted similar allegations against Berru. Music publicist Beth Martinez was one of the first women to share her story after Coffman. Martinez accused Berru of allegedly putting his hand down her shirt as she repeatedly told him to stop. She also said Berru and ""members of his crew"" may have ""roofied"" her on multiple occasions. Martinez's account of Berru's alleged sexual misconduct: Other woman in the industry came out with their stories on Twitter, too, after Coffman and Martinez -- including Tearist frontwoman Yasmine Kittles, former MTV host Shirley Braha and Best Coast singer Bethany Cosentino.So far, at least eight women have come forward with similar allegations of sexual misconduct against Berru. Below are some of the tweets from women who have accused Berru of some form of sexual misconduct.A former drummer of multiple bands, Roxy Lange, told Brooklyn Magazine on Tuesday that Berru sexually assaulted her in 2007. ""He kept trying to force me to give him a blowjob in a cab and wouldn’t stop pushing my head into his lap forcefully, with his pants unzipped and penis out in the open,"" Lange said. ""After I got out of the cab, he followed me up three flights of stairs and forced his way into my apartment, attempting to force himself on me but he was luckily too drunk and coked up to get hard so he gave up."" (Read the rest of Lange's story here.)Multiple musicians quickly started to tweet their support for the women and publicly cut ties with Berru's PR company Life Or Death on Tuesday. Some of the artists who cut ties with Berru included rock band Wavves, Brooklyn-based band DIIV and Speedy Ortiz guitarist Sadie Dupuis. Below are some of the tweets from the musicians.On Tueday evening, less than 24 hours after Coffman's initial tweets, Life Or Death PR issued a statement which informed the public that Berru will step down as CEO of the company.Life or Death has a zero tolerance policy for the type of conduct alleged in today’s online postings. We take these allegations very seriously... We are taking measures to ensure that the alleged behavior did not, and will not, make its way into company operations or impact our commitment to promoting art and assisting our clients.... We are grateful to Heathcliff Berru for all the work he's done to date and his creative vision at the company. We appreciate and support his decision to step down as CEO of Life Or Death.Read Life Or Death's full statement here.Berru also issued a statement later that Tuesday night to L.A. Weekly. Read Berru's full statement below: There have been several reports about my alleged inappropriate behavior which deserve a response. I am deeply sorry for those who I have offended by my actions and how I have made certain women feel. If I crossed the line of decency or respectfulness in situations when I was drunk and under the influence, there is no excuse of course. To be clear, while my conduct may have been inappropriate, I have never drugged anyone or engaged in that type of behavior. Nevertheless, I do not want to be the type of person who would let drugs or alcohol take command of his life and compromise how he treats people. Yet I have been this person and it’s time to put a stop to all of this. Create a world with one less inappropriate man.Coffman responded to Berru's statement with a tweet Wednesday morning.Also on HuffPost:"

18,POLITICS,Death Row Inmates In Limbo After Florida's Death Penalty Scheme Scrapped,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-death-penalty-changes_us_569e8b41e4b0cd99679b90a5,A Supreme Court ruling has left the state's judicial system with a lot of question marks.,2016-01-20,The Florida Supreme Court's ruling on a death row inmate facing execution next month will provide clues as to how the state will handle the cases of many inmates who were sentenced to death before the U.S. Supreme Court deemed the state's death sentencing scheme unconstitutional.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569fd6c11a00001001ab0f67.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 389 inmates on Florida's death row gained something last week that they haven't had since before they were sentenced: the possibility -- however faint -- that they won't die in an execution chamber. The U.S. Supreme Court in Hurst v. Florida struck down Florida's death penalty sentencing scheme as unconstitutional, ruling that a jury, not a judge, must specify the reason a defendant should be punished with death. Florida's sentencing scheme has been an outlier: Unlike in most states, juries could recommend the death penalty without a unanimous decision, they did not have to reveal to the judge which aggravating factors informed their decision, and judges could ultimately override a jury's recommendation. While the high court made it clear that juries must determine sentences, its ruling leaves the fate of inmates who were sentenced under the now-unconstitutional scheme in cloudy waters. ""It’s all in the hands of the Florida Supreme Court. They could reverse every one of those sentences. They could reverse only those currently still on appeal,"" said Michael Radelet, a sociologist and capital punishment expert at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""Predicting is pretty complex, because like all death penalty issues, it comes down to three things: One is politics, two is politics and three is politics."" No one knows how the Florida Supreme Court and the state legislature will move forward with capital sentences in one of the nation's most prolific death penalty states. Legal experts are further divided on whether the Hurst ruling will apply to some or maybe all of those already on death row.""There are really, really good arguments for the [state] Supreme Court to find this retroactive,"" said Seth Miller, a lawyer and the executive director of the Innocence Project of Florida.The Florida Supreme Court decided last year that two previous landmark rulings on juvenile sentencing by the U.S. Supreme Court applied retroactively to Florida inmates who were sentenced as juveniles, Miller noted.O.H. ""Bill"" Eaton, a retired Florida trial judge and death penalty expert who trains lawyers on capital cases, agreed there was a good argument for applying the ruling retroactively, even if just to a small group. ""It’s at least retroactive to all the cases pending 'in the pipeline' -- everyone arrested or will be arrested before the new statute is passed,"" Eaton said. ""It could affect everybody on death row, depending on how the Florida Supreme Court reviews the retroactivity aspect.""How Florida handles the case of Cary Michael Lambrix, who is scheduled to be put to death on Feb. 11, may provide clues as to how the state will proceed with the more than 140 inmates who have already exhausted their appeals at the state level.""We will get some hints with Michael Lambrix's execution,"" Radelet said.

19,POLITICS,Death Row Inmates In Limbo After Florida's Death Penalty Scheme Scrapped,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-death-penalty-changes_us_569e8b41e4b0cd99679b90a5,A Supreme Court ruling has left the state's judicial system with a lot of question marks.,2016-01-20,The case of Cary Michael Lambrix could provide clues to how Florida's Supreme Court might retroactively apply the landmark Hurst v. Florida ruling to inmates who were sentenced to death row under a now-unconstitutional scheme.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569fd5691a00002d00ab0f61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 389 inmates on Florida's death row gained something last week that they haven't had since before they were sentenced: the possibility -- however faint -- that they won't die in an execution chamber. The U.S. Supreme Court in Hurst v. Florida struck down Florida's death penalty sentencing scheme as unconstitutional, ruling that a jury, not a judge, must specify the reason a defendant should be punished with death. Florida's sentencing scheme has been an outlier: Unlike in most states, juries could recommend the death penalty without a unanimous decision, they did not have to reveal to the judge which aggravating factors informed their decision, and judges could ultimately override a jury's recommendation. While the high court made it clear that juries must determine sentences, its ruling leaves the fate of inmates who were sentenced under the now-unconstitutional scheme in cloudy waters. ""It’s all in the hands of the Florida Supreme Court. They could reverse every one of those sentences. They could reverse only those currently still on appeal,"" said Michael Radelet, a sociologist and capital punishment expert at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""Predicting is pretty complex, because like all death penalty issues, it comes down to three things: One is politics, two is politics and three is politics."" No one knows how the Florida Supreme Court and the state legislature will move forward with capital sentences in one of the nation's most prolific death penalty states. Legal experts are further divided on whether the Hurst ruling will apply to some or maybe all of those already on death row.""There are really, really good arguments for the [state] Supreme Court to find this retroactive,"" said Seth Miller, a lawyer and the executive director of the Innocence Project of Florida.The Florida Supreme Court decided last year that two previous landmark rulings on juvenile sentencing by the U.S. Supreme Court applied retroactively to Florida inmates who were sentenced as juveniles, Miller noted.O.H. ""Bill"" Eaton, a retired Florida trial judge and death penalty expert who trains lawyers on capital cases, agreed there was a good argument for applying the ruling retroactively, even if just to a small group. ""It’s at least retroactive to all the cases pending 'in the pipeline' -- everyone arrested or will be arrested before the new statute is passed,"" Eaton said. ""It could affect everybody on death row, depending on how the Florida Supreme Court reviews the retroactivity aspect.""How Florida handles the case of Cary Michael Lambrix, who is scheduled to be put to death on Feb. 11, may provide clues as to how the state will proceed with the more than 140 inmates who have already exhausted their appeals at the state level.""We will get some hints with Michael Lambrix's execution,"" Radelet said. ""If the court grants relief in his case, they’re going to have to grant relief in a lot of other cases as well.""

21,POLITICS,Robert Reich's Seriously Funny Crusade To Save Capitalism And America's Middle Class,"Danny Feingold, Capital & Main",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-reich-capitalism_us_569fc38ee4b0fca5ba763539,The former labor secretary has become the most entertaining critic of the nation’s unequal economy.,2016-01-20,"Robert Reich is explaining at a furious pace, with a nonstop output of blog posts, op-eds, videos and lectures.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569fc3ce1f00007f002164d1.jpeg?cache=M1aqdCmiTD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s two weeks before Thanksgiving, and a crowd of 500 people has filled the Silicon Valley Commonwealth Club to hear former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich discuss a decidedly less than festive topic: How the economy is leaving most Americans behind. The subject, which inspired Reich’s latest book, Saving Capitalism, hits particularly close to home here, where uber-rich tech titans coexist with legions of low-wage workers, even as the middle class is increasingly squeezed out of nearby communities like Redwood City and Milpitas by ever-rising housing prices.But Reich has no intention of bludgeoning his audience with bleak statistics and grim predictions. “As you can see, the economy has worn me down,” says the 4-foot-11-inch Reich, pausing as laughter spreads across the room. “Really, before the Great Recession I was, you know, 6 foot 2.”Moments earlier, when I met Reich in an empty banquet room and asked if he preferred to be called “Professor” or “Bob,” he answered in a deadpan voice: “‘Your Highness.’” I had traveled from Los Angeles to trail Reich for a couple of days to better understand the man who has become at once the most visible, and most entertaining, critic of the nation’s unequal economy.In an era dominated by polarizing blowhard commentators, Reich is an anomaly: The avuncular scholar who prefers to disarm rather than denigrate.“He can never be accused of being a zealot,” Alan Simpson, the arch-conservative former Republican Senator from Wyoming and one of Reich’s best friends, explained to me later. “A zealot is one who, having forgotten his purpose, redoubles his efforts. He is not that. He’s a very complex and a very deep, centered human being. And he thinks of human beings who are not doing well, and he gravitates toward, 'How do you solve that?'""Reich’s humor is woven seamlessly into a narrative that is also veined with generous doses of history, a style that, along with his fame, has made him a popular professor at the University of California, Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy, where he has been a faculty member since 2006.“Bob is one of the best explainers out there,” said Jared Bernstein, Vice President Joe Biden’s former chief economist and who, like Reich, is one of the country’s most prominent progressive voices on inequality. “He takes issues that are complicated and multilayered and distills their essence into quick, simple, accurate and entertaining points that make sense to any interested party. Listening to Bob is like watching a master musician or athlete.”As he nears 70, Reich is explaining at a furious pace, with a nonstop output of blog posts, op-eds, videos and lectures. (He has even appeared in an animated video for Capital & Main.) “I don’t want to do anything else,” he told me the day after the Silicon Valley speech. “This is extremely satisfying. I have the best job in the world.”I was interviewing Reich in his U.C. Berkeley office, where, dressed casually in a blue sweater and gray jeans, he was catching his breath between book tour events. In one corner of the room stood a video camera attached to a tripod, ready to use whenever Reich records messages requested by groups across the country. On a wall hung a frame with Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’ famous quote: “We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can’t have both.”The 35-year decline in wages for most Americans, coupled with the demise of pensions, the escalating cost of housing, rising student debt and a host of other discouraging economic indicators, has led to what Reich and many other observers see as a steady erosion of the American Dream. He distilled his thoughts about the seemingly inexorable waning of that dream in the 2013 documentary Inequality for All, which offers a primer on the prolonged tailspin of the American middle class and is shot through with healthy doses of his trademark humor.Saving Capitalism expands Reich’s critique: It’s not just the economic system that is failing us, he argues, but a political system that, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling, is controlled more than ever before by the wealthy. In Reich’s view, the “free market” is a misleading construct that distracts from the reality that rules govern any market economy — and that in the U.S. those rules are being rewritten to advance the interests of a few rather than the many.“Anybody who thinks that the answer is found in policy has not been paying attention,” he said, revealing a major shift in thinking for a man who has championed his share of policy prescriptions. “Good policies are a dime a dozen. The real issue now is a matter of power. How in the world do you get good policies enacted and enforced?”Reich’s firm belief that fundamental economic change will only come through a sweeping realignment of political power may partially explain the intensity of his crusade against the excesses of contemporary capitalism. As economic inequality has entered the national conversation, he has become to that issue what Al Gore is to climate change – only funnier.He credits one of his early bosses with teaching him the importance of humor: the late Robert Bork, for whom Reich worked when Bork was Solicitor General in the Ford administration. “He was a lovely man. Very funny,” Reich recalled. When Bork came up during the question-and-answer portion of his Silicon Valley appearance, Reich said, “I liked him a great deal. We disagreed, however, on the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Ninth Amendments to the Constitution, which put a crimp in our working relationship.”Though hardly the lightning rod his old boss was, Reich attracts his share of criticism, some of it quite heated. During an argument over income taxes on ABC’s This Week in 2011, conservative commentator George Will fumed, “You are a pyromaniac in a field of strawmen.” On the left, Reich has been targeted by fellow economist Paul Krugman, who in one article acidly dismissed his colleague’s concerns about economic insecurity among well-paid workers: “Like much of what Reich says, this story is clear, compelling, brilliantly packaged and mostly wrong.” (Krugman did write a positive review of Saving Capitalism for the New York Review of Books.)Reich rolls with the punches. During his Silicon Valley speech, he acknowledged that his new book has raised the ire of both ends of the political spectrum. While on a promotional tour through several red states, he told the Commonwealth Club audience, he found that “nobody liked the title, Saving Capitalism. They were kind of annoyed — ‘It sounds like you are being critical. What’s wrong with capitalism?’ I got back to Berkeley and nobody liked the title. They said, ‘Why do you want to save it?’”Born in 1946 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a city renowned for its fierce union organizing battles of the early 20th century, Reich grew up in what he describes as a middle-class home. “We weren’t rich but never felt poor, and our standard of living rose steadily throughout the 1950s and 1960s,” he writes in Saving Capitalism, evoking collective memories of a simpler, more prosperous era. It was a time when his father got ahead by selling women’s clothing.In our interview, Reich added some nuance to his personal story, shedding light on his decades-long effort to change an often unforgiving economy. His dad, now 101, struggled for years with his business, moving it from town to town until things finally improved, in part due to his mother helping out in the shop. “My father worked incredibly hard and I was sensitive to his anxiety about just keeping a roof over our heads and keeping us going,” he explained.Reich and his family also experienced anti-Semitism, further sensitizing him to exclusion from the halcyon promise of mid-century America. And then there was his height – born with a rare genetic disorder that stunted his growth, he was bullied throughout his youth and sought protection from older boys.I asked Alan Simpson, who now practices law in Cody, Wyoming, why he thought Reich was so driven to address the economic inequities of American society. “It has to do with his upbringing, his background, his philosophy of life,” he said.That philosophy includes respect for those with views different than his own, like Simpson. The two met in Washington, D.C. in the early 1990s, and hit it off right away when the 6-foot-7-inch senator introduced himself at a Beltway mixer, prompting Reich to respond, “I can’t even see you,” and jump on a chair.Simpson shared with me a story about visiting Reich shortly after he became Labor Secretary. “I said to my staff, ‘I’m gonna go over to see Bob Reich, I’m gonna go eat lunch with him.’ And they said, `You don’t want to go see Bob Reich, he’s a liberal Democrat, for God’s sake. He’s FDR, you know, he’s this and that.’ So I said, ‘I don’t give a damn about that, that’s where we’re going.’ And then one time he told his staff he was going to go over to see Simpson. They said, ‘Oh, God, you don’t want to go see Simpson. He’s a Republican from Wyoming.’ He said, ‘I don’t care what you think about it.’ So we would actually meet somewhere and have a tuna sandwich and just have a good time.”(In the late 1990s, while the two men were both living in Boston, they co-hosted a PBS political talk show, The Long and the Short of It, which attracted guests in part because of the congenial relationship between the two. “People loved coming [on] because we weren’t playing sharpshooter or talking across each other,” Simpson said.)His tolerance for dissenting ideas notwithstanding, Reich is very much a product of the liberal social movements of the 1960s. Like many from his generation, Reich’s idealism was both forged and shaken by the traumatic events of that time. His childhood friend Michael Schwerner was one of three civil rights activists murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1964, and he lost another friend in the Vietnam War. Reich would later intern for Senator Robert F. Kennedy, absorbing his “absolute commitment to a more just society.” With the 1968 assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., and with American cities erupting in flames, Reich began to sink into despair. “I thought the country was going to hell,” he admitted.But Reich’s innate optimism and buoyant temperament have carried him through several decades of generally bad news for the middle class that he sees as the linchpin of the country’s economic stability and social cohesion. These also sustained him during his years in the Clinton Administration, where he witnessed a brilliant politician slide down the slippery slope of sometimes unprincipled compromise.“Bill Clinton is a very skillful, charming man, and I learned a lot watching him at close range,” observed Reich, who met Clinton when they were on a boat sailing to England as young Rhodes Scholars in 1968. “I learned what skillful politicians do to win people over. I certainly learned that I’m not one, and I also learned how easy it is to confuse means with ends. This is a deep and endemic problem in politics, because a politician is always trading off means and ends. But sometimes those trade-offs are so demanding and persistent that a politician loses sight of what the ends are all together. It all becomes means.”Also on HuffPost:"

They fanned out across the region to sites that included a mall in nearby Emeryville, where a police last year killed a suspected shoplifter. Black Seed and the Black Queer Liberation Council claimed responsibility for blocking the bridge. It was part of a larger weekend of protests organized by another group, the Anti Police Terror Project. In addition to criticizing shootings by police, the groups called for investments in affordable housing and the resignation of Oakland Mayor LIbby Schaaf and the firing of San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr.

Todd Rutherford (D) and Democratic Reps. Joe Jefferson and David Mack, who were leaders in the push to bring the flag down, are co-sponsoring the resolution.“When I saw the video of the woman being kicked out of the Donald Trump rally, I was truly sick to my stomach,” King told The Huffington Post. “It reminded me of the old Jim Crow footage from the 1960s. Most of [Trump’s supporters] have never ever met a Muslim, all they know is what they may have heard on Fox, and from Donald Trump, and he knows that plays on their fears.”King, who is the chairman of South Carolina’s Legislative Black Caucus, said the state “can’t afford to roll out the red carpet to a modern George Wallace anymore” and that Trump “deserves to be put in a museum,” alongside the Confederate battle flag removed from the state Capitol grounds. (Now, Democrats are fighting the proposed $3.6 million display for the flag at the Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum in Columbia, the state capital, saying taxpayers shouldn’t be on the hook for such a controversial symbol.)The Confederate flag at the South Carolina Capitol was first placed atop the Statehouse dome in 1962, during the centennial observation of the Civil War, as a gesture of defiance to the burgeoning civil rights movement. In 2000, over 46,000 people marched in Columbia for the flag to finally come down from the top of the Capitol. The flag was moved to the grounds as a compromise, after months of pressure from business and political leaders and an economic boycott of the state by the NAACP.That same year, South Carolina became the nation’s last state to officially designate MLK Day as a state holiday.State Rep.

Joseph Darby, the former pastor of Morris Brown AME Church in Charleston and a leader of the state’s NAACP, called it a shame that more “good, decent people” in the Republican Party aren’t challenging and condemning Trump’s racism. He noted that a white supremacist group had run robocalls in Iowa urging caucusgoers to vote for Trump, and that Trump had refused to condemn the group's message. ""That’s their base,"" Darby said. Then again, “[Republicans have] been blowing the dog whistle since the Nixon years. Trump is just blowing a bullhorn instead of the dog whistle.” Darby said that the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse was an attempt to ""do something quick and fast"" to say that Dylann Roof, who killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston last summer, does not signify broader racial divisions in the state. ""All it took was for nine black folk to get killed,"" he said ironically. ABC’s George Stephanopoulos asked Trump on Sunday what he would say to African-Americans who believe King’s dream has not been realized. Trump said, speaking in the third person, that he would “be great for African-Americans.”“President Obama, an African-American, has done a terrible job for African-Americans,” he said. “Donald Trump will do a great job for African-Americans. I'll bring back jobs to this country from China and many other places, and I'll let people work and make a great living.”Also on HuffPost: "

He noted that a white supremacist group had run robocalls in Iowa urging caucusgoers to vote for Trump, and that Trump had refused to condemn the group's message. ""That’s their base,"" Darby said. Then again, “[Republicans have] been blowing the dog whistle since the Nixon years. Trump is just blowing a bullhorn instead of the dog whistle.” Darby said that the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse was an attempt to ""do something quick and fast"" to say that Dylann Roof, who killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston last summer, does not signify broader racial divisions in the state. ""All it took was for nine black folk to get killed,"" he said ironically. ABC’s George Stephanopoulos asked Trump on Sunday what he would say to African-Americans who believe King’s dream has not been realized. Trump said, speaking in the third person, that he would “be great for African-Americans.”“President Obama, an African-American, has done a terrible job for African-Americans,” he said. “Donald Trump will do a great job for African-Americans. I'll bring back jobs to this country from China and many other places, and I'll let people work and make a great living.”Also on HuffPost: "

It sounds like he does now.",2016-01-19,New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) says his immigration plans would cause some undocumented immigrants to leave.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569ec2791a00005a00ab0e6c.jpeg?cache=2nhETadnei&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie supports making it so difficult for undocumented immigrants to live in the U.S. that they'll ""leave on their own,"" he told the Washington Examiner in an interview published on Monday. Interviewer Byron York asked Christie if he, like opponent and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R), supports ""attrition through enforcement."" Christie replied, ""I think that would be the practical effect of it, yes."" The New Jersey governor's remarks weren't dissimilar from those of other Republican presidential candidates. But they were somewhat contradictory for a politician who had previously rejected the feasibility of ""self-deportation"" -- a term popularized by 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who proposed instituting tough policies that would cause undocumented immigrants to leave the country.""I'm not someone who believes that folks who have come here in that status are going to engage in self deportation,"" Christie said in April of last year. Romney's support for self-deportation was widely thought to have harmed his chances at winning over Latino voters, who overwhelmingly voted against him. After his loss, the idea of self-deportation -- or at least the use of the term -- was widely condemned. The Senate later passed comprehensive immigration reform that would have allowed undocumented immigrants to stay in the U.S., but the legislation failed in the House, falling victim to cries of ""amnesty."" The current race for the Republican nomination is dominated by businessman Donald Trump, who is calling for swift mass deportation. Christie still rejects that idea. He told York that the country ""can't do what Trump is talking about, which is a mass deportation of 11 million people in two years.""Yet the governor said the policies he supports would drive some undocumented immigrants out.""If they can't get a job here, they can't get work here; a number of them will leave,"" Christie said. ""And that's part of the whole enforce-the-law process that I was talking about before -- biometric system at the border on visas, E-Verify on employment inside the country, and secure our border at the southern border.""For the sake of comparison, here's how Romney described self-deportation during a 2012 presidential debate, according to CBS News:""The answer is self-deportation, which is people decide they can do better by going home because they can't find work here because they don't have legal documentation to allow them to work here,"" he said. ""And so we're not going to round people up.""A spokeswoman for Christie disputed the notion that the governor supports broad self-deportation, arguing instead that he believes enforcing strict employment laws would deter undocumented immigrants from crossing the border and cause some of those who are already in the country to leave.UPDATE: Jan. 21 --Christie said Thursday on the Laura Ingraham radio show that he still stands by his comments in April.However, he added that policies he supports, like using E-Verify to check work authorization, would cause some undocumented immigrants to leave. I also do think that that doesn't mean that we shouldn't use E-Verify and fine employers, in my view, double whatever they make off of someone if they hire illegally, in order to send a very clear message to the people who are already here and those who who plan on trying to come illegally that you're not going to be able to be employed here.

The European Food Safety Authority recently issued a scientific opinion endorsing 150 g to 600 g of fish weekly during pregnancy, Julvez and colleagues note in the American Journal of Epidemiology. But, the study team writes, the effects of maternal fish consumption during development are still not well understood and more research could help give pregnant women clearer guidance.The researchers analyzed data from the Spanish Childhood and Environment Project, a large population study that recruited women in their first trimester of pregnancy, in four provinces of Spain, between 2004 and 2008.Julvez and colleagues focused on records of the women’s consumption of large fatty fish such as swordfish and albacore tuna, smaller fatty fish such as mackerel, sardines, anchovies or salmon, and lean fish such as hake or sole, as well as shellfish and other seafood.Women were tested for blood levels of vitamin D and iodine, and cord blood was tested after delivery to measure fetal exposure to mercury and PCB pollutants. At ages 14 months and five years, the children underwent tests of their cognitive abilities and Asperger Syndrome traits to assess their neuropsychological development.On average, the women had consumed about 500 g, or three servings, of seafood per week while pregnant. But with every additional 10 g per week above that amount, children’s test scores improved, up to about 600 g. The link between higher maternal consumption and better brain development in children was especially apparent when kids were five.The researchers also saw a consistent reduction in autism-spectrum traits with increased maternal fish consumption.Mothers’ consumption of lean fish and large fatty fish appeared most strongly tied to children’s scores, and fish intake during the first trimester, compared to later in pregnancy, also had the strongest associations. “I think that in general people should follow the current recommendations,” Julvez said. “Nevertheless this study pointed out that maybe some of them, particularly the American ones, should be less stringent.”Julvez noted that there didn’t appear to be any additional benefit when women ate more than 21 oz (about 595 g) of fish per week.“I think it's really interesting, and it shed a lot more light on the benefits of eating fish during pregnancy,” said Dr. Ashley Roman, director of Maternal Fetal Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York.“I think what's interesting about this study compared to some data previously is that they better quantify the relationship between how much fish is consumed in a diet and then the benefits for the fetus and ultimately the child,” said Roman, who was not involved in the study.“They're able to correlate the fish consumption with protection from autism and I think that is potentially a very important finding,” she added.Roman said that fish is really important for the fetus's brain development.“We still recommend that women avoid the fish that are highest in mercury like catfish, shark, swordfish and giant mackerel, typically the larger fish that have longer lifespans and they tend to concentrate more mercury in their tissue,” she said.SOURCE: bit.ly/1RnLwGO American Journal of Epidemiology, online January 5, 2016.Also on HuffPost:"

He made the comments at a not-so-well-attended event -- about 10 people -- in Gladbrook, Iowa, according to the Des Moines Register. The former Pennsylvania senator told the group he had dismissed a teacher's concerns about his deportation plan because of the undocumented students she knows. ""My response is, 'Great. Do you realize what a blessing they will be to their country when they go back?'"" he said, the Des Moines Register reported.He added that since Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are ""a mess,"" it would be good for them if undocumented immigrants returned. ""You are talking about folks who are going to be the leaders of their countries,"" Santorum said. ""I think that the best thing that we can do to stem the tide of illegal immigration is to have them go home and save their countries.""

""They learned the English language. They learned about capitalism. They learned about democracy. You want to stop the flow of immigrants.

El Salvador is on track to pass Honduras as the world's homicide capital. Santorum's comments present a very positive spin on his immigration position, though it amounts to mass deportation. Previously, however, he has expressed mild sympathy for families that could be separated by deportations. In a speech in August outlining his immigration plans, he compared deporting parents of U.S. citizens to imprisoning criminals who have children.
