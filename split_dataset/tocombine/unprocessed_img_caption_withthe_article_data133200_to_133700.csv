1,TRAVEL,New Season Brings New Ski Lifts and Terrain,"Liftopia, Contributor
Largest online and mobile marketplace for lift tickets and oth...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-season-brings-new-ski_us_5b9dbeb2e4b03a1dcc8c5e97,"The 2013-14 season has brought another slate of terrain expansions and new ski lifts.

However, most of the dearly departed areas were tiny local hills, so skiers and snowboarders still have plenty of resort terrain. In fact, many destination resorts have significantly grown in skiable acreage during the past couple decades. High-speed lift installations make more vertical feet on that acreage possible during a day on the slopes.The 2013-14 season has brought another slate of terrain expansions and new ski lifts. In some cases, the trend of bringing ""side-country"" in-bounds offers the flavor of rugged backcountry skiing, minus any serious avalanche concerns.Sugar Bowl Resort in California has installed the $3 million Crow's Peak Chairlift to access more than 150 new acres of advanced and expert steeps and glades. Bucking the high-speed quad and six-pack trend, the new lift is a fixed-grip triple due in part to the lack of space for the top terminal. The fixed-grip lift also can better handle wind. Factoring in the sheltered nature of that portion of the resort, Crow's Peak should be spinning even on most storm days. Photo Credit: Sugar Bowl, Grant BartaIn Colorado, Breckenridge Resort has added a major expansion of 543 acres on Peak 6 with an accompanying new lift. Vail Mountain, meanwhile, put in a six-pack lift to replace the Mountain Top Express Lift.Changes at Copper Mountain involve two surface ski lifts. The Colorado resort upgraded the Storm King surface lift that had been installed in 1985. The brand-new Celebrity Ridge surface lift runs at the top of the Sierra chairlift to improve access to Union Peak, Union Meadows, West Ridge and Copper Bowl. Photo Credit: Copper Mountain Resort, Storm King Surface Lift Construction AreaWinter Park Resort did not build a new lift, but the Colorado ski area made access to its taste of backcountry skiing much easier. Although reminiscent of a backcountry experience, the 1,332 acres of the Cirque were in-bounds and avalanche-controlled in previous seasons. Reaching the area, however, required a fairly flat hike that was more time-consuming than technical. This season, the ""Cirque Sled,"" a 48-passenger snowcat, will eliminate that slog. A $10 pass covers unlimited rides on the Cirque Sled for the entire season. Photo Credit: Winter Park, Eric Wagnon, the CirqueWhile the Cirque Sled will just attract experts, a wide range of ability levels should appreciate the new Treasure Stoke Lift at Colorado's Wolf Creek Ski Area. A major artery coming out of the ski area's main base, the new detachable high-speed quad replaces the Treasure Lift, a triple chair.In Utah, the only new lift is the replacement at Snowbird of the original Gad 2 double chairlift that goes back to 1971. The new high-speed detachable quad will cut the ride time in half. Photo Credit: Snowbird Ski and Summer ResortWhitefish Mountain Resort has cut a few new blue runs as part of the Flower Point Project. Although the Montana resort's new trails are already lift-served, a new lift in the 2014-15 season will directly access the north-facing Flower Point area. Whitefish, formerly known as Big Mountain, is unusual among U.S. ski areas in that the ""front"" of the resort faces south. Therefore, more north-facing terrain means more trails with better snow preservation in the spring. Photo Credit: Whitefish Mountain Resort, Summit House ViewCrystal Mountain in Michigan installed a new high-speed quad called the Buck Quad. Along with the new lift, the area increased its skiable terrain to 48 trails with three new runs: Buckaroo, Buck Glades and Gorge Glades.

But if the white runs out I'll drink the red."" -- Seen on a cocktail napkin, source unknown.Intense images and emotions fill my head and my heart when I think of, ""The Big C.""Angst and apprehension. Fear, frustration and fatigue. Circumstances that bring out the best, and the worst. I'm talking, of course, about Christmas.The most memorable Christmas display I ever saw was in a small department store in rural Japan. It was Santa on a cross. While it made me laugh, it illustrated how confusing the holidays can be, and that they can mean such varied things to different people. Also, that each of us has a cross to bear, even old Kris Kringle.  For many years Christmas made me sad. It can be a brutal season for a single person. I'd had too many silent nights, too many holidays alone under the mistletoe with no one to deck my halls or jingle my bells.But those are ghosts of Christmas past. Last year at this time I had a new husband, new family, new home, warmly lit and replete with the visceral holiday smells of mulled cider and fresh pine. On the night of December 26, Harlan and I contentedly climbed the stairs as people we love slept all around us. In hushed tones we reviewed the events of the day as he massaged my neck and shoulders. His hands froze when, for the first time, he felt the pea-sized knot at my throat. Last Christmas I got a lump of cancer.Now, 'tis the season again. As we put lights on our house and decorate our tree, every shiny ball or glittery decoration has huge import to me, but I don't know if it's a talisman against danger or a harbinger of bad tidings to come. I'm not usually superstitious, but this year I guess I am.While decorating our tree my six year-old step-daughter, Eloise, asked me what Christmas is really about. I felt as stymied as Maureen O'Hara in Miracle on 34th Street, when Natalie Wood asks if there truly is a Santa Claus. While I believe in being candid with kids, I couldn't look into Eloise's hopeful little face and grumble that it's all about marketing. I'm not a religious person so I considered it best not to go down that path, and I didn't want to spout platitudes. I thought hard about how to answer Eloise gently, honestly.  As with most of life's great questions, I found the answer in a Broadway show tune. Ironically, I think the essence of what the holidays mean to me is best summed up by Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof: ""Tradition!""There's a peace that comes from repeating familiar acts, even and especially when life goes off the rails. I find this when gently unwrapping generations of family ornaments, kneading dough for my Grandma Mac's shortbread cookies, baking my Grandma Anna's kugel, or showing Eloise how to make snowflakes that sparkle while listening to the old holiday songs. Our traditions are connective tissue to the past, and to the future. Knowing that I am part of this continuum, that the little mark I leave may carry on, helps me to face whatever may come with clarity, calm and courage. Courage. That's ""The Big C"" I want for Christmas, and this year the bigger the better.This column originally appeared on Parade.com. For more by Jennifer Glass, click here.

She tells Caramanica:I can’t say too much. But it was where I was kind of going to have to do this trade-off, and I wasn’t willing to. Right now, me doing any kind of cover for anything that’s like, a Seventeen or Teen Vogue or whatever, the way that I talk isn’t the way that people that are 17 really understand.Cyrus goes on to misquote Kurt Cobain explaining, ""There's a special place in hell for people that glamorize drugs."" But we doubt any cover Anna Wintour gives her coveted nod of approval would glorify the party drugs that the ""Bangerz"" singer references on her raunchy record.Besides, Cyrus proved she could clean up her look and work the camera covered-up for the October 2013 cover of Harper's Bazaar.
