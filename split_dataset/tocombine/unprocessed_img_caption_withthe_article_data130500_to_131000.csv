1,PARENTING,What Does the Fox Say About Parenting Tweens and Teens?,"Sarah Bamford Seidelmann M.D., Contributor

Their dependents learn to fly in the dark, adapt to shifting environments and feed themselves.

Your teen suddenly compares you to other parents, who dress ""normally,"" buy ""much better food,"" give their kids the newest iPhone and are generally waaaaaaay (hashtag OMG) more cool than you. Where do you turn for inspiration?Parents of teens and tweens need role models to teach us how to launch our kids into the world so they're ready for life (and, God willing, eventually have their own health insurance). Foxes and other wild animals have been raising teens for eons. Their dependents learn to fly in the dark, adapt to shifting environments and feed themselves. If they can teach their teens/tweens to survive on this planet, you can too.Here is what the Fox (and three other helpful animals) say about parenting tweens/teens: 1. Fox Says ""NEED-SOME-HELP-PLLLLEASE""If your house is like mine, a lot of epic shizzle must get done every day to keep the family ship sailing: load and unload the dishwasher several times, cook some sort of meal(s), bus dishes, walk the irrepressible dog. On top of that, you're charged with signing school papers, writing checks and helping with homework. You can do it all yourself, but it's so much better if you have help, like the fox does. Naturalists note that teen foxes, if they want to eat, must assist the vixen (momma fox) until they're ready to claim a territory of their own. Teen foxes keep busy guarding, playing with, grooming and provisioning the younger foxes. They're the vixen's personal assistants.If you've got younger kids, how can your tween/teen help with them? Could they read for 20 minutes with a younger sib? How else could they contribute to the den's operations? Make a simple dinner for everyone? Haul groceries from the car and put them away? Think like a vixen. Get some help.2. Emperor Penguins Say ""BRRRRRRRRR"" Being a parent of tweens/teens can make you feel a little like Tonya Harding at the Sochi Winter Games: unpopular, scandalous and a wee bit old. Whenever my tweens/teens give me the cold shoulder, I think of the Emperor Penguin. These feathered arctic daddies shuffle around at 50 below zero with an egg stuck between their legs for a whole damn winter, braving the unceasing polar winds without shelter. When you feel your resolve crumble, turn your chest bravely into the cold wind blowing from your tween/teen and envision daddy penguins braving blizzards. Remember, spring always comes. Surely, you can withstand the gale force of tween angst as you explain to them (again) that you won't be taking them to the mall until their room is clean. Nobody has it as bad as the emperor penguin. Nobody. 3. Giraffes Say ""BUH-BYE""When you have trouble leaving your tweens/teens for a 15-minute respite, date night, yoga class or a 21-day pilgrimage to India, remember the giraffe momma. Giraffes leave their kids behind periodically without batting a long-lashed eye. Why? Because a watering hole in Africa is a dangerous place for a young giraffe. There are too many predators. Momma giraffe leaves her kids with other adults and seeks refreshment... alone. It's dangerous to continue the perilous hobby of parenting without rehydrating, metaphorically, at your own water hole (weekly, if possible). We all get thirsty. 4. Leopards Say ""ROOOOAAAAR""Your tween craves consumer goods -- another Xbox game, a Rainbow Loom organizer, a fresh pair of Nikes. You give them an allowance, but it's never enough, and you wonder, Should I give them more? Wait! Hold on to your dream of independent offspring and study the leopard. I once saw a teen leopard feasting happily in the south African bush on a lovely leg o' antelope his mother had dropped off for him. Teen leopards aren't capable of making clean kills on their own... yet. Momma leopard teaches teens by literally throwing them a bone, something they can chew on independently. Once they master that basic task, they graduate to bigger hunting lessons. If your tween/teen is cash poor, you can offer them a leg o' antelope -- an opportunity to learn how to feed themselves by earning extra money (Scrape ice off the driveway? Reorganize the pantry?). Though they may only snarl and retreat up the nearest tree, giving them opportunities to learn how to support themselves is still a good idea. When a leopard momma senses that her teen has sufficient basic skills, she stops dropping off the antelope legs. She allows hunger to build in her teens, because hunger motivates. It gets them off the couch to hunt for themselves.A Final Foxy TipI've heard tell of fox parents tossing $20 bills into a jar, hastily labeled, in black Sharpie, with the words ""Therapy Fund."" After making a deposit, wild fox parents laugh and dance, knowing they've done their very best to raise their young, but if it's not enough... there's help for that, too.

Do you go for the one with the large...acreage...or do you opt for the one that everyone else has already dated? It's a difficult dance, one that takes years to master. Not to fret: There's the perfect ski resort waiting in the wings, patiently biding his time until you've gotten tired of the bad boy and realize that sometimes heated lifts aren't everything. The First Love Photo credit: Amy MorrisonMy first love was Beech Mountain Resort in North Carolina. My parents took me skiing there when I was a toddler, but the real love affair began when I was in college. I visited Beech Mountain as part of a fraternity trip and strapped on skis for the first time in 15 years. The result wasn't pretty (the boys were great teachers for going straight and fast--not so good with turning or explaining how to stop), but I was enamored with the camaraderie on the slopes, the cute town of Boone and a crazy thing called snowboarding. When I moved to Colorado, it was like leaving high school boys and finding the appeal of college boys. Lots of college boys. I was thrilled by the sheer number of and decided that I would try out as many ski resorts as I could, traveling to different states if necessary. After all, searching for the perfect match takes time and often the guy (oops, ski resort) that you're with might not be the right one. The Boy Next DoorI moved to Breckenridge based on the online description of its historic main street and three peaks of skiing (when I moved there, Peaks 7 and 6 hadn't opened yet). Breckenridge was in my backyard and became the guy that lived next door that would borrow the vacuum cleaner before his mom came to visit. Breckenridge was comfortable due to its familiar runs and oft-ridden lifts. I learned a lot about myself as a skier on the slopes of Breckenridge.  I learned so much about myself as a skier that I became a snowboarder. I loved Breckenridge, and while it still holds a special place in my heart, I knew that there were other--possibly cuter--boys to check out. The Random Hook UpIt started as all good random hookups do. I was on a business trip to Idaho and had the opportunity to visit Schweitzer Mountain Resort, which is about 10 miles north of Sandpoint. I didn't know anything about Idaho ski resorts--I didn't even know that there were ski resorts in Idaho until I got there.  Photo credit: SchweitzerIt had been a tough March--the snowpack was disappearing and Schweitzer had actually closed for the season. But then the snow came, magically erasing all of the brown bits and creating a fluffy, gorgeous scene that was the snowboarding equivalent of beer goggles. I was smitten. For that magical day (the resort reopened just for that day), I reveled in the knee-deep powder with hardly a soul in sight. As is often the case with hookups, I haven't seen Schweitzer since. However, it's better this way--reality can never live up to the memory.The Bad BoyIn every life, a bad boy must come. You know the one--he's tough and rough and probably spent some time in prison (or rehab). Your friends tell you that he's not right for you but you find yourself inexplicably drawn to his steep chutes, his rocky cliffs and that je ne sais quoi known as a coulouir. Jackson Hole Resort was the bad boy in my life. I heard stories about the extreme terrain, the crazy nights at the Mangy Moose and Silver Dollar Saloon and I just had to see for myself. It took just one ride up the tram to realize that Jackson Hole actually lives up to its bad boy reputation. The snow is deep, the bowls are big and the opportunities to launch yourself off of a cliff are multitudinous. I gazed at the mountain and wished that I was hardcore enough, cool enough and crazy enough to impress Jackson Hole resort. But I'm not. I realized that a Jackson Hole would never really satisfy my needs in a ski resort, but goodness, he's certainly fun to look at. The Long Distance Relationship Photo credit: theMountainPulse.comIf Jackson Hole is the bad boy in my life, Grand Targhee is his funnier, smarter and better-looking brother with an impressive 500"" of powder a year. Grand Targhee is my long-distance boyfriend. I love everything about Grand Targhee. I love the fact that there are only five lifts but the resort has what seems like unlimited terrain. He's supportive, not mocking or condescending. I've done some of my best riding there, carving up fresh powder on steep terrain, feeling like a badass the entire way. Of course, the Trap Bar is always there to serve up a few beverages along with the stories. Like most long distance relationships, it's a frustrating one. When we get together, it's fantastic but the logistics of us staying together in the long run are just too difficult. We've made a pact, though--if we're both still single in five years, we'll marry each other. The Friend of a FriendThere's always that one guy that you see at every party that's friends with your friends, but you never really get to see him in real life. Copper Mountain is that friend of a friend for me. I lived in Summit County for eight years and never rode at Copper. Sure, I would hear how epic the snow was and I would see the half pipe and beautifully groomed runs on my I-70 drive, but somehow Copper and I never made a connection. I still look longingly at Copper when I drive by or when I see posts on Facebook, but we're still at that awkward we-know-each-other-but-haven't-hung-out stage. I still have hope, though. So, for now, I'll keep Copper as a drive-by crush until he gets up the nerve to ask me out. Or vice versa. The One You've Got Your Eye OnEven if you're in a happy relationship, there's always someone that you have your eye on. Not in a cheating, duplicitous way, just in a, ""hey, I've heard a lot about you and you seem really cool...we should hang out sometime.""Crested Butte seems to have it all: a great ski town, tons of snow, challenging yet accessible terrain and a laid-back charm that exudes confidence while avoiding douchebaggery. I'm putting it out there, but Crested Butte is one that I have my eye on. There's no harm in looking, is there? Photo Credit: Crested-ButteI'm still in the search for that perfect ski resort relationship, but I'm confident that it just takes time and a lot of powder research. After all, that's why the multi-resort ski pass was invented. This post originally appeared on the Liftopia blog.By Katie Coakley, Katie on the Map, @KatieCoakley"
