The initiative is being funded by donations and sales of papal parchments sold by Krajewski's office.Francis has stepped up the role of the Vatican ""elmosiniere"" as part of his insistence that the church should look out for the poorest. In addition to small acts of charity, Krajewski's office handed out 400 sleeping bags to the homeless over Christmas, distributed 1,600 phone cards to new migrants on the island of Lampedusa, and this past week gave away some 300 umbrellas that had been left behind at the Vatican Museums to help the homeless cope with days of heavy rain in the capital."

Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis will meet euro zone counterparts the day before.A Greek official said EU leaders should not expect Tsipras, who rode to power on a groundswell of anger over EU-imposed austerity that has helped to impoverish many Greeks, to say one thing at home and another to them.""What the prime minister will say in parliament will be ... the same things that we will say in Brussels,"" said the official, who asked not to be named. ""He will be very specific.""Over the past week, Greek officials have laid out what they see as a transitional plan to keep finances flowing over the next few months while they renegotiate their debt agreement.They will first reject a 7.2 billion euro bailout tranche that has been due pending a suspended review.Instead, they want the right to issue more short-term debt beyond a current 15 billion euro threshold. They also want 1.9 billion euros in profits from Greek bonds held by the European Central Bank and other euro zone authorities, something that was agreed previously.With that as a bridge, Greek officials would then try to renegotiate payment of Greek sovereign bond debt, perhaps by extending payments, only paying interest and getting some respite on the budget surplus it is expected to run.As for the government's policy, some of which is deemed in European capitals irresponsible or too costly, a government official suggested that not everything had to happen at once.""The pace of the implementation of our promises is 'within four years',"" the official said.(Editing by Mark Heinrich)"

Dana's tweet about a current media screw-up was striking given that he hasn't publicly commented for two months about Rolling Stone's discredited report on an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia. Since questions arose in late November over the Rolling Stone feature story, Dana has given one interview. On Dec. 7, he told The New York Times that the magazine was ""picking up the pieces"" and looking to move on. But the journalistic scandal was only beginning, as several news organizations re-reported aspects of the Rolling Stone piece and several UVA students further disputed the account of Jackie, the story's subject. Dana, writer Sabrina Rubin-Erdely and others involved with the story remained silent as questions continued for several weeks. On Dec. 22, Rolling Stone founder and publisher Jann Wenner announced that Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism would conduct an independent review of article.After this reporter noted Dana's tweet about Williams on Sunday, the Rolling Stone editor responded that he is not discussing the UVA story until Columbia completes its report. Some journalists, like the Wall Street Journal's Neil King, have recently questioned when the independent review, now underway for six weeks, would be completed. Steve Coll, dean of Columbia's journalism school, said in an email Sunday to The Huffington Post that he and Dean of Academic Affairs Sheila Coronel ""have made good progress on our interviews, document reviews and other research.""""We are starting to draft the report and hope to complete it as soon as possible, although I can't predict exactly when,"" Coll said. ""Rolling Stone has been fully cooperative so far."" Indeed, Dana said in an email to HuffPost that he ""commented extensively"" to Coll's team for its report. "

It revisits Edith Wharton's classic novel The House of Mirth and gives it a surprise happy ending. But romance per se isn't one of the genres I publish in. Not that I'd ever rule it out. I started as a short story writer, became a mystery author, added memoir, psychology, horror and more genres than I ever imagined to my list. I've always read across genres since I had my first library card and I could never stay with just one form as an author. I admire people who happily produce one book a year in the same mystery series. That would feel like solitary confinement to me. When I started out, an author friend warned me that publishing was a crazy business, and he was right. Ever since my first book was published in 1990, I've been seeing news items about one scary trend or another. In the old days I'd call my editor or huddle with other authors or call friends who wrote. Then as the Internet took over, I would watch chat get panicky in discussion groups and I'd fall into the trap of emailing doom-saying studies to people in my network. Now Twitter and FB make bad news instantly go viral.Here are the facts: there's always bad news in publishing about something. If you're an author, you have to do more than just get used to it, you have to be scrupulously selective. You have to quickly scan it to see if there's anything you can glean that might help you.But the most important thing to remember is this: you can't ever let any news item or chart or reported trend deflect you from your path. You have to keep writing and growing as a writer (which also means reading widely). And yes, you need to keep learning everything you need to about the business--but not to the point where you feel overwhelmed and your writing suffers.You have to keep your eyes on the prize. That's how I've published twenty-five books no matter what the hell was going on around me. And at times it felt like a cyclone of bad news. Doesn't matter. Whenever I'm worried about publishing or my career, I remember the great lines from the Henry James' story ""The Middle Years"" about writers: ""our doubt is our passion and our passion is our art."" They keep me going. Lev Raphael's latest book is Assault With a Deadly Lie, a novel of suspense about gun violence, stalking, and militarized police."

When the question was first posed in 1990, the rate was 18 percent.Today's college students are more ethnically diverse than in the past, the annual survey released Thursday from the UCLA's Cooperative Institutional Research Program shows. Program director Kevin Eagan said that may be why the number who think racial discrimination is no longer an issue has increased only slightly in 25 years. ""Each year, you have more students who may have been subject to discrimination in their lives,"" Eagan explained to The Huffington Post. ""That may play out in how they view this particular issue.""Jaleesa Jones, a senior at the University of North Carolina, said she's surprised so many students think racial discrimination isn't a problem. ""I think that stance is willfully ignorant,"" she said. Eagan and Jones both pointed to racial tensions exposed by the killings of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Michael Brown as signs that racial issues continue to fester.""We've watched black life be devalued on a national scale this past year -- not only through police brutality, which has always been an issue but is just now becoming highly visible, but through the subsequent vilification of the victims, mostly men and women of color,"" Jones said. Almost nine in 10 students who were surveyed said they are more tolerant than most. Two-thirds said there's a ""very good chance"" they'll socialize with friends from different racial backgrounds. The racial composition of neighborhoods where students come from also has shifted. In 2014, 61.6 percent of freshmen were from ""mostly white"" or ""completely white"" neighborhoods, down from 86 percent in 1983. Freshmen today are more likely to believe they have a better ability to see the world from someone else's perspective than in the past, Eagan noted. That perception of empathy, he said, ""may be subsequently influencing that discrimination is still a very real issue."""

Mission America's Linda Harvey, whose opposition to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is well-established, slammed Perry in a Feb. 5 column for BarbWire. In the article, Harvey argues that Perry offered an ""invitation to demonic possession"" during the performance, and promoted the ""homosexual agenda"" with the smash tune, ""I Kissed A Girl."" ""Sexual confusion is a natural companion to spiritual apostasy,"" Harvey wrote. ""Just like her flirtation with Satan, she’s merely joining and providing theme music for a movement that long pre-dates her.""She continued:[""I Kissed A Girl""] demonstrates where sexual license eventually takes a willing culture, and heterosexuals who experiment with -- and like -- homosexual behavior is one natural progression. “People can’t be turned ‘gay’!” scream the activists as they pour “LGBT” propaganda into our schools, into movies, into every TV show, into public policy, and into the cooperative courts.You can take a look at Harvey's full column here. The remarks aren't particularly surprising given Harvey's history. Last year, she joined a growing chorus of conservative voices by defending bakeries and other wedding vendors who've turned away same-sex couples, comparing the LGBT movement to Nazi Germany in the process.She also argued that LGBT teens ""do not need to come out,"" because doing so marked ""the beginning of many troubling roads for young people.""Perry, also, isn't the first Super Bowl halftime performer to come under conservative criticism.

Today, we speak with leading Argentinian journalist Nelson Castro about the mysterious murder of prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who had accused the government of covering up a 1994 terror attack.Argentina is embroiled in its most sensational political scandal in decades, a twisted saga of terrorism, torture, murder and high-stakes international politics. The deadly 1994 bombing that killed 85 people at Jewish community center has haunted the country for two decades, and the case was thrust back into the headlines following the suspicious death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman on Jan. 18.Nisman had recently accused President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of cutting a deal with Iran -- a prime suspect in the bombing -- to cover up Tehran's role in the attack. Hours before Nisman was scheduled to testify before Argentina's congress, he was found dead from a gunshot wound in his apartment. Initially ruled a suicide, Nisman's death has since been labeled homicide, sending shock waves through Argentinian politics. The discovery of a draft arrest warrant for Kirchner in Nisman's apartment has only heightened tensions.Prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found dead hours before he was supposed to present his allegations against President Kirchner to congress.Kirchner has denied all involvement in Nisman's death, claiming the prosecutor was the victim of a conspiracy by the nation's intelligence agencies to destroy her presidency. She has pointed out that Argentina never asked international police to remove arrest warrants for Iranian leaders, as Nisman alleged, and the country has not benefited from Iranian oil. In a recent speech, Kirchner called for the country's intelligence agencies to be dissolved and rebuilt from the ground up.Investigations into the bombing have been marred by all manner of corruption and incompetence: The former president stands accused of accepting an Iranian bribe to derail the case, a former judge was fired for bribing a witness, and a separate investigator was kidnapped and brutally tortured with a knife and blowtorch. The WorldPost spoke with the respected Argentinian radio and television host Nelson Castro to understand what the scandal means to the country's citizens.What is the sentiment on the ground among Argentinians? What do they make of these conflicting conspiracy theories?Most people are angry, and also anguished. They suspect that the government is not working hard enough to ensure the total clearing of the case. Even though most people don’t believe that the government was involved in the murder of Nisman, most people think the government is not doing enough to clear the case. Further, the involvement of people from the Argentine intelligence services raises suspicions of the government's responsibility for the lack of protection of Mr. Nisman had, considering the high risk that his denouncement implied. Remember that when he announced the charges, he said that he could be murdered for it. Instead of taking care of him and taking his words seriously, the government mocked him and made fun of him. People are saying that the government is responsible for not taking care of him the way he deserved.How has the story been reported in local media? Is coverage split along party lines?That’s the problem we have here in Argentina: There are divisions inside the press. The pro-government press will of course side with the government and say that there is a conspiracy against the government. Those who work independently consider the objective facts, and the facts are quite clear concerning the responsibility of the government in not taking care of Nisman. The independent media also covers all of the elements of Nisman’s denouncement. The fact of the matter is that everything that the government denied happened to be true. The independent press showed that to the people, and because of this we have to face provocation, defamation, and criticism by the government and the official press.How dangerous could this be to President Kirchner? Is there danger of this bringing down the current government?There’s no risk that this could bring down the government -- fortunately that doesn’t happen in Argentina anymore. But of course this is going to affect those candidates running for Kirchner’s party in the next election. That is indisputable. Polls are showing that the image of the government -- which was not so bad considering the whole mess with the economy -- has gone down. The positive image of the government was around 35 to 36 percent, but now it’s gone down to 22 to 23 percent.President Kirchner has blamed Nisman's accusations and death on a conspiracy by the country's intelligence agencies. How do Argentinians view their own intelligence services, particularly in light of their history during the ""Dirty War""?People have a really huge negative view of intelligence services. People blame the government for the situation, but of course that is nothing new. This government has been in power for more than 10 years and has done nothing to improve things. Quite on the contrary, they took advantage of the dark side of the intelligence services in order to damage political leaders from the opposition. So at this moment, that’s one of the things people are quite angry at the government about. The Argentinian people have a clear notion that this is something that must be improved, and that it will take a lot of work from the next government. Paradoxically, the government is clearly affected by the situation at this moment. After having displaced the whole leadership of their intelligence services, the government is blind. It has no intelligence services at all, effectively nothing in order to face the crisis caused by Nisman’s death.What's next for both the investigations that Nisman was carrying out, and the investigations into his death?Analysts are convinced that the investigation led by Nisman is not going to continue -- nobody else will dare to go as far as Nisman did. So in a way, that case has been definitively ended because of Nisman’s death. The government will hugely benefit because no one will dare to take the case the way that Nisman did. Concerning the investigation of Nisman’s murder, things are a little uncertain as to whether the prosecutor who is managing the case is going to be able to solve it. So in both cases -- Nisman’s death and Nisman’s accusation -- we have the idea that impunity will prevail, unfortunately.This interview has been edited for clarity.More On The Scandal in Argentina: - The Unsolved Terror Attack At The Center Of Argentina's Political Crisis - Why A 1994 Terror Attack Is Still Haunting Argentina TodayProtesters gather outside the governmental palace in Buenos Aires to protest after the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman.

Murdough, 56, was found dead in his cell in a mental observation unit in the early hours of Feb. 15, after excessive heat, believed to be caused by an equipment malfunction, redirected itâs flow to his upper-level cell, the officials said. (AP Photo/Jason DeCrow)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae06571f00002e0122d4c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 2013, Jerome Murdough baked to death in a 101-degree Rikers Island cell. This is how a former U.S. Marine met his end.In the United States of America, patriotism is a highly popularized sentiment. The love and pride in one's country is an attribute often trumpeted throughout society. As America, home of the brave, a key component of patriotism is supporting our troops. Almost everyone agrees, those who fought for our country should be supported. Yet with all the declarations of veteran support, the USA has a dismal record of actually doing it.To say that we've fallen short is an understatement. Key examples of this bleak record includes: the initial neglect of veterans suffering from Gulf War Syndrome and depression, years of disregarding the effects of Agent Orange exposure on Vietnam veterans, the consistent silence on Iraq veteran suicide rates and the maltreatment of rape victims in service. There are also the years of racism, homophobia and second-class treatment of women in the ranks.However, it's not just the government that has fallen short on protecting veterans. Business entities such as for-profit colleges took advantage of the G.I. Bill, making millions of dollars deceptively convincing veterans to use their financial aid towards degrees that are likely to be uncompleted or unaccepted among employers.It's safe to say that veterans are a grossly underserved group of society. And the numbers get worse when reviewing ethnic and racial breakdowns. According to theNational Coalition for Homeless Veterans, veterans make up ""12% of the adult homeless population."" African Americans represent 40% of homeless veterans.There are a number of things that account for this. Reasons include but are not limited to: mental illnesses, physical disabilities and poverty. Black veterans deal with the same issues as other veterans. However, structural racism is often an additional barrier to societal support. Furthermore, with the criminalization of poverty and homelessness, homeless Black veterans are further marginalized by society.This leads us back to Jerome Murdough. His death made headlines after his body was discovered in a Rikers Island cell. Murdough's crime was sleeping in a stairwell. His punishment as a homeless mentally ill veteran was ""baking to death"" alone in a cell.When we reference ""Black Lives Matter,"" this isn't some overreaction or unwarranted clarion call. It isn't about falsely creating a hyper-sensationalized sob story narrative.Events across the country each month confirm that ""Black Lives Matter"" is a necessary statement. Black life is continually disregarded except when in service or entertainment positions. Since this nation's inception, Black lives have been utilized for hard labor and servitude, then abruptly discarded once service value is no longer available. This pigeonholing, along with the lack of access to resources and upward mobility, is a structural problem deeply rooted in the fabric of society.From Rick Santorum's, ""I don't want to make black people's lives better by giving them somebody else's money,"" to Paul Ryan's inner city ""culture problem,"" accusations of laziness are often tossed around when discussing poverty, homelessness and imprisonment. Though their sentiments have long been discredited, they represent a flawed mindset based on stereotypes and racialized perceptions.Yet in the case of veterans, you'd be hard pressed to find a greater example of hard work and dedication. What's the excuse here?Jerome Murdough represents more than a singular story. Thousands of unnamed Black veterans have similar experiences of extreme abuse, neglect or utter disregard. When we say, ""Black Lives Matter,"" this is what we're talking about. We're lifting up the lives of Jerome Murdough and countless unnamed people when no one else will.As a nation, there needs to be serious steps towards dismantling structural injustices, otherwise talks of patriotism are nothing more than glorified banter.In the words of Langston Hughes, ""I, Too, am America.""Black Lives Matter.This post is part of the ""28 Black Lives That Matter"" series produced by The Huffington Post for Black History Month.

Until 2011, when she graduated from London College of Communication's University of Arts, with an M.A. in Documentary Film under her belt, De Angelli was an accomplished research scientist.  She's one of those rare breed of people who own a killer mix of brains, beauty and heaps of talent. She studied Molecular Biology at the University of Bucharest and graduated at the top of her class. She earned a PhD from the Erasmus University in the Netherlands, and moved to London to work at the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine. Palace of Westminster, London, UK - Photo: Nora De AngelliHailing from the beautiful town of Sinaia, Romania, De Angelli had an amazing childhood. Since she grew up in the Carpathian Mountains, her parents encouraged her to embrace skiing at a very young age, and she continued to practice it competitively until she was 16. This instilled in her a certain amount of discipline that helped her navigate the life challenges as a young adult.Happy with a career path that seemed clearly paved in the science world, and enjoying her new life in the vibrant London, the place she now calls home, De Angelli was introduced by a couple of friends to Argentine tango, something that would become more than just a new hobby for the soft-spoken workaholic. Even though she had never danced before, she learned tango, mastered it and became a tango instructor herself, teaching hundreds of aficionados the beauty of this spectacular dance. Nora De Angelli & Ben Hayeem Dancing Tango - Photo: Courtesy of the ArtistThe Wakeup Call That Changed Her LifeNothing would have predicted what was going to happen on a beautiful Indian summer day in 2007. As she was rollerblading in Hyde Park, De Angelli was knocked down full force by another skater. She was rushed to the hospital with a broken arm and went through a grueling eight-hour surgery.  The next day, she woke up in the intensive care unit. A young girl standing by the window got her attention. She must have been 18-20 years old. De Angelli noticed that, unlike everyone else in the room, who would either be connected to an IV or a medical device, the girl seemed fine. She got out of bed, walked to the window, and started talking to her, letting out all her pain, fear and worries about the accident and its potential consequences. The girl turned to her and said: ""I have terminal thyroid cancer. The doctors said I have two more weeks to live."" Those words had the effect of a lit up light bulb in the scientist's brain. Despite the multiple fractures in her arm, De Angelli realized how minor her problem was compared to what that girl must have gone through.She reflected on the biggest regret she would have had if she had died, and that was not having traveled enough and capturing what's out there. That's when she decided to become a travel writer and explore photography.""In 2008, while I was recovering from my accident, I bought my first digital camera, a Nikon D3. That was the true beginning of photography for me. I became fascinated by image editing and the amazing variety of choices and options in terms of post-processing,"" recalled De Angelli.Six months into her recovery, she started taking her first wildlife photos in Hyde Park. She was preparing for a trip to Fiji Islands and wanted to get used to her brand new camera. The results had exceeded her expectations.Wildlife, Hyde Park, London, UK - Photos: Nora De AngelliStarting to travel has changed her life completely. Photographing the world helped her discover who she really was and what she really wanted to do in life.She didn't specialize, which, for some photographers, may sound strange. Yet, for De Angelli, that's the beauty of what she does. Not leaving any magic moment behind without being immortalized. She shoots breathtaking landscapes, stunning macro pictures, untamed wildlife, and expressive portraits: ""I cannot imagine being deprived of taking the most beautiful macro shot, just because your specialty is only landscape photographer.""Ever since she made her transition into photography, she's been enjoying seeing the world through her lens while taking pictures of places and people from all over the world. ""Being behind the lens is a great responsibility and in the same time, for me it's a privilege,"" explained De Angelli. ""The moment I take the picture, I am responsible for the image of my subjects. I am the one responsible for treasuring and using these images with respect. It is the privilege I get being behind the lens: the wholehearted trust of strangers.""The Quest for the Perfect ShotDe Angelli strives for perfection in every shot she takes. The way she tells her stories, both through words and amazing imagery is fascinating. Not only does she take the shots, but she immerses in them analyzing every single detail: ""I know people say that art (film and photography) is a creative and free process, but for me, to accomplish it to perfection, I've got to really work on it. It is a bit like exact science: there is no great photo or great movie made without a great deal of perfection in details, compositions, colors, lights.""De Angelli's scientific background and artistic talent mixed with her dedication and belief in humanity makes her photography more than just a simple visual record: ""I think humanity and all its values is stronger than words. The mutual understating of the many differences and similarities we have will always prevail. Whatever binds us together is far greater than what divides us.""  As a self-taught photographer, she keeps learning and educating herself. How? ""Work, work and work again."" By taking pictures, analyzing them, throwing away many of them, and going back out there again to take more shots. She has read hundreds of photography books, albums, articles and tutorials about all the techniques involved in the photographic art. De Angelli always keeps in mind a quote from Kurt Mutchler, Senior Photo Editor at National Geographic Magazine: ""So what is the secret to making great pictures? Keep at it. The more you shoot, the better you get.""Her photos are rarely processed extensively, although she acknowledges the importance of image editing software. She usually crops, sharpens, changes contrasts, exposure and erases the dust dots: ""I like the photojournalistic style, the natural and real feel of photographs.""She also learns a lot from sites like 1x, 500px and National Geographic, studying the photos, the trials and the forums written by the greatest photographers of all time. She uploads images periodically and submits them to be critiqued by crew members, as a way of testing herself and improving her skills. Many of her images were approved and published on all these sites, which was equally rewarding and surprising for the eager photographer.De Angelli recalls fondly those happy times when she would come home from work exhausted, and spend all night editing photos: ""I know it was not ideal for my day job, but, deep down inside of me, I felt happy and content with what I was achieving in photography.""And achieving she did. She won numerous competitions and her photos were featured on National Geographic, 1x, National Geographic Stock Photography, The Guardian UK and CNN International websites.Inspiration and Fantastic Photographic ExperiencesDe Angelli remembers the effect shooting Mount Fitz Roy had on her as a photographer, and the emotions that experience had made her feel:""Mount Fitz Roy was my first surreal adventure in photography, in the 'Patagonian' spring of 2008. The peak of the mountain is almost always hidden in the clouds, hence its name, 'the smoking mountain', so the chances of seeing it during that one visit were very small. We trekked for 10 hours that day and we arrived at its base late afternoon. It was a beautiful warm day and the snow was still melting. The moment we reached the base of the mountain, we could not believe our eyes: the sheer granite faces of the peaks were projected on the crystal clear blue sky, shining brightly in the sun."" Mount Fitz Roy, Southern Patagonia - Photo: Nora De Angelli""Next to the base of the mountain there was the most intense turquoise lagoon I had ever seen, in Spanish named Laguna de los Tres, with a couple of condors soar the skies. I took my camera out and before taking any pictures, I could not resist and lost my control for a few seconds. I jumped up in the air and burst into a sort of laughter or even a scream, shouting out as loud as I could: 'This is aaammaaaaziiing! This is sooo beautiful!' I called my group to hurry up and come see the most staggering scenery of all. I will never forget that moment. It was surreal."" Mount Fitz Roy and Laguna de los Tres, Southern Patagonia - Photo: Nora De AngelliThe world inspires her. The places she explores while travelling on all five continents. Photography has taught her how to see the world, how to pay attention to detail, how to notice the light, and how to discover more beauty in the places and people around her. ""I learned how to appreciate every moment I spent travelling, which became a journey of discovering not only the obvious, but also the hidden 'gems' of the world,"" admitted De Angelli.That goes for Africa too, another place she loved very much to photograph and would like to go back to: ""The intensity and beauty of the colors, the beauty of the people, the diversity and grandeur of the landscapes, the wildlife, the luxuriant equatorial forests or the red earth of Africa, all fascinated me. The beauty of the people I took portraits of, had something hypnotic, old, mysterious, deep. Their dignifying attitude and their inner strength, combined with the warmth and candor of their eyes, give them that epic human dimension.""Maasai Mara Warrior and Baby Girl, Tanzania - Photos: Nora De Angelli Favorite Recent Images  From Fiji to Argentina, from Tibet to Jordan and from Chile to Israel, De Angelli has covered some of the most extraordinary places in the world.""Some of my favorite images of all time, which happen to be also quite recently taken, are the images of Sri Lankan fishermen who live on the seashores of the Indian Ocean, around Negombo,"" recalled the photographer.   Fisherman of Negombo, Sri Lanka - Photo: Nora De Angelli""For generations the fishermen based in Negombo have been living in abject poverty. They sleep on the beaches along the ocean shores, next to the places where they work for most of their lives. The sheds are made of palm leaves and rotten wood, covered with plastic bags or various pieces of thorn cloth."" The Fishermen of Negombo - Photo: Nora De Angelli""There were no words that could have described the harshness of these peoples lives, the sad resignation and the sacrifice of their existences, but in the same time, the kindness and the candor of their smiles, which I got in return of mine.""Segueing into Documentary Film ProductionWhen she started exploring photography after her accident, De Angelli didn't have a clearly defined, beginning-to-end plan. She just kept learning and studying and things started falling into place. Then she made Worlds In Transformation, a 30-minute film that included a story made out of her images, which was her entry into documentary film production.While she studied for her Master at London College of Communication, the photographer made three powerful documentaries. She had the freedom to pick her own subjects: ""I tend to choose film subjects that combine a good story - usually involving a certain degree of mystery or some intriguing legend, built around a solid scientific truth - like in The Czech Torah Scrolls, great filming sets - I believe that the visual experience is equally important - like in Petra in Danger, and thirdly, I choose subjects that are close to my heart, that have been fascinated me for a long time like in the Romanian Monarchy.""A 30-minute version of the latter was screened in London at the Barbican, intriguing the audience and earning her critical praise.What's Next?De Angelli is working on two major projects she put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into. Both of them have one thing in common - the artist's home country, Romania.  The first one, to be published this year, is a scientific photographic album about the wild orchids of Romania, called The Magnificent World of Orchids - Illustrated by the Wild Orchids of Romania. It was photographed and written in collaboration with her father, Dan Anghelescu, and it's one of their lifetime dedication projects. Epipactis Purpurata Orchid - Photo: Nora De AngelliThe artist explained: ""Because the wild alpine orchids are the most elusive of all plants, it took us more than 25 years to find and photograph the wild species of Romanian orchids, equally found all over Europe, alongside other 700 species of rare and endemic alpine plants, that we intend to publish subsequently."" Cypripedium calceolus - Photo: Nora De Angelli""This first bilingual album (in English and Romanian) is an insight into the magnificent world of Orchidaceae family, an over view of the history of their discovery, the myths and symbolism they inspired along the millennia, and the intriguing anatomical adaptations these plants designed to allure and fool their pollination insects in order to reproduce. It's a dynamic, modern story of the Orchidaceae family, full of unexpected facts, which will unveil the most unbelievable truths about these surprising and spectacular plants. I hope it will be a joyful discovery for the public.""The second project is the feature length documentary about the Romanian Monarchy, which she's about to finish this year. The film turns one of the most important pages in the Romanian history, covering the untold story of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen Royal Dynasty of Romania, and the way they changed their adoptive country's course of history.As she advances in her new career, De Angelli remains humble and grounded. She's very much aware of her ongoing learning process, even though she has come a long way: ""No matter how hard or difficult it will be at times, I consider myself privileged to be a part of such an enriching and rewarding undertaking.""A bit hesitant in her humility when asked to give a piece of advice to aspiring photographers, De Angelli said: ""Giving advice is a very hard task in many ways. However, I'll try. Firstly, assess very well what is your real passion in life.""Secondly, if it turns out to be photography, don't get intimidated. Just get inspired! Rather sooner than later, you'll discover that there are so many great photographers out there that you'll get intimidated by. Just learn from their work and experiences and continue to improve your skills. There's a place for everyone in this wide world. There will always be someone who will appreciate your art. Just be sure you know what you are doing and improve each day.""And thirdly, find your own style and get a good manager. Try to even build a team. It will make your life easier and your achievements higher. Become a real business.""For more details about Nora de Angelli's work, visit her website.<>"

Until 2011, when she graduated from London College of Communication's University of Arts, with an M.A. in Documentary Film under her belt, De Angelli was an accomplished research scientist.  She's one of those rare breed of people who own a killer mix of brains, beauty and heaps of talent. She studied Molecular Biology at the University of Bucharest and graduated at the top of her class. She earned a PhD from the Erasmus University in the Netherlands, and moved to London to work at the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine. Palace of Westminster, London, UK - Photo: Nora De AngelliHailing from the beautiful town of Sinaia, Romania, De Angelli had an amazing childhood. Since she grew up in the Carpathian Mountains, her parents encouraged her to embrace skiing at a very young age, and she continued to practice it competitively until she was 16. This instilled in her a certain amount of discipline that helped her navigate the life challenges as a young adult.Happy with a career path that seemed clearly paved in the science world, and enjoying her new life in the vibrant London, the place she now calls home, De Angelli was introduced by a couple of friends to Argentine tango, something that would become more than just a new hobby for the soft-spoken workaholic. Even though she had never danced before, she learned tango, mastered it and became a tango instructor herself, teaching hundreds of aficionados the beauty of this spectacular dance. Nora De Angelli & Ben Hayeem Dancing Tango - Photo: Courtesy of the ArtistThe Wakeup Call That Changed Her LifeNothing would have predicted what was going to happen on a beautiful Indian summer day in 2007. As she was rollerblading in Hyde Park, De Angelli was knocked down full force by another skater. She was rushed to the hospital with a broken arm and went through a grueling eight-hour surgery.  The next day, she woke up in the intensive care unit. A young girl standing by the window got her attention. She must have been 18-20 years old. De Angelli noticed that, unlike everyone else in the room, who would either be connected to an IV or a medical device, the girl seemed fine. She got out of bed, walked to the window, and started talking to her, letting out all her pain, fear and worries about the accident and its potential consequences. The girl turned to her and said: ""I have terminal thyroid cancer. The doctors said I have two more weeks to live."" Those words had the effect of a lit up light bulb in the scientist's brain. Despite the multiple fractures in her arm, De Angelli realized how minor her problem was compared to what that girl must have gone through.She reflected on the biggest regret she would have had if she had died, and that was not having traveled enough and capturing what's out there. That's when she decided to become a travel writer and explore photography.""In 2008, while I was recovering from my accident, I bought my first digital camera, a Nikon D3. That was the true beginning of photography for me. I became fascinated by image editing and the amazing variety of choices and options in terms of post-processing,"" recalled De Angelli.Six months into her recovery, she started taking her first wildlife photos in Hyde Park. She was preparing for a trip to Fiji Islands and wanted to get used to her brand new camera. The results had exceeded her expectations.Wildlife, Hyde Park, London, UK - Photos: Nora De AngelliStarting to travel has changed her life completely. Photographing the world helped her discover who she really was and what she really wanted to do in life.She didn't specialize, which, for some photographers, may sound strange. Yet, for De Angelli, that's the beauty of what she does. Not leaving any magic moment behind without being immortalized. She shoots breathtaking landscapes, stunning macro pictures, untamed wildlife, and expressive portraits: ""I cannot imagine being deprived of taking the most beautiful macro shot, just because your specialty is only landscape photographer.""Ever since she made her transition into photography, she's been enjoying seeing the world through her lens while taking pictures of places and people from all over the world. ""Being behind the lens is a great responsibility and in the same time, for me it's a privilege,"" explained De Angelli. ""The moment I take the picture, I am responsible for the image of my subjects. I am the one responsible for treasuring and using these images with respect. It is the privilege I get being behind the lens: the wholehearted trust of strangers.""The Quest for the Perfect ShotDe Angelli strives for perfection in every shot she takes. The way she tells her stories, both through words and amazing imagery is fascinating. Not only does she take the shots, but she immerses in them analyzing every single detail: ""I know people say that art (film and photography) is a creative and free process, but for me, to accomplish it to perfection, I've got to really work on it. It is a bit like exact science: there is no great photo or great movie made without a great deal of perfection in details, compositions, colors, lights.""De Angelli's scientific background and artistic talent mixed with her dedication and belief in humanity makes her photography more than just a simple visual record: ""I think humanity and all its values is stronger than words. The mutual understating of the many differences and similarities we have will always prevail. Whatever binds us together is far greater than what divides us.""  As a self-taught photographer, she keeps learning and educating herself. How? ""Work, work and work again."" By taking pictures, analyzing them, throwing away many of them, and going back out there again to take more shots. She has read hundreds of photography books, albums, articles and tutorials about all the techniques involved in the photographic art. De Angelli always keeps in mind a quote from Kurt Mutchler, Senior Photo Editor at National Geographic Magazine: ""So what is the secret to making great pictures? Keep at it. The more you shoot, the better you get.""Her photos are rarely processed extensively, although she acknowledges the importance of image editing software. She usually crops, sharpens, changes contrasts, exposure and erases the dust dots: ""I like the photojournalistic style, the natural and real feel of photographs.""She also learns a lot from sites like 1x, 500px and National Geographic, studying the photos, the trials and the forums written by the greatest photographers of all time. She uploads images periodically and submits them to be critiqued by crew members, as a way of testing herself and improving her skills. Many of her images were approved and published on all these sites, which was equally rewarding and surprising for the eager photographer.De Angelli recalls fondly those happy times when she would come home from work exhausted, and spend all night editing photos: ""I know it was not ideal for my day job, but, deep down inside of me, I felt happy and content with what I was achieving in photography.""And achieving she did. She won numerous competitions and her photos were featured on National Geographic, 1x, National Geographic Stock Photography, The Guardian UK and CNN International websites.Inspiration and Fantastic Photographic ExperiencesDe Angelli remembers the effect shooting Mount Fitz Roy had on her as a photographer, and the emotions that experience had made her feel:""Mount Fitz Roy was my first surreal adventure in photography, in the 'Patagonian' spring of 2008. The peak of the mountain is almost always hidden in the clouds, hence its name, 'the smoking mountain', so the chances of seeing it during that one visit were very small. We trekked for 10 hours that day and we arrived at its base late afternoon. It was a beautiful warm day and the snow was still melting. The moment we reached the base of the mountain, we could not believe our eyes: the sheer granite faces of the peaks were projected on the crystal clear blue sky, shining brightly in the sun."" Mount Fitz Roy, Southern Patagonia - Photo: Nora De Angelli""Next to the base of the mountain there was the most intense turquoise lagoon I had ever seen, in Spanish named Laguna de los Tres, with a couple of condors soar the skies. I took my camera out and before taking any pictures, I could not resist and lost my control for a few seconds. I jumped up in the air and burst into a sort of laughter or even a scream, shouting out as loud as I could: 'This is aaammaaaaziiing! This is sooo beautiful!' I called my group to hurry up and come see the most staggering scenery of all. I will never forget that moment. It was surreal."" Mount Fitz Roy and Laguna de los Tres, Southern Patagonia - Photo: Nora De AngelliThe world inspires her. The places she explores while travelling on all five continents. Photography has taught her how to see the world, how to pay attention to detail, how to notice the light, and how to discover more beauty in the places and people around her. ""I learned how to appreciate every moment I spent travelling, which became a journey of discovering not only the obvious, but also the hidden 'gems' of the world,"" admitted De Angelli.That goes for Africa too, another place she loved very much to photograph and would like to go back to: ""The intensity and beauty of the colors, the beauty of the people, the diversity and grandeur of the landscapes, the wildlife, the luxuriant equatorial forests or the red earth of Africa, all fascinated me. The beauty of the people I took portraits of, had something hypnotic, old, mysterious, deep. Their dignifying attitude and their inner strength, combined with the warmth and candor of their eyes, give them that epic human dimension.""Maasai Mara Warrior and Baby Girl, Tanzania - Photos: Nora De Angelli Favorite Recent Images  From Fiji to Argentina, from Tibet to Jordan and from Chile to Israel, De Angelli has covered some of the most extraordinary places in the world.""Some of my favorite images of all time, which happen to be also quite recently taken, are the images of Sri Lankan fishermen who live on the seashores of the Indian Ocean, around Negombo,"" recalled the photographer.   Fisherman of Negombo, Sri Lanka - Photo: Nora De Angelli""For generations the fishermen based in Negombo have been living in abject poverty. They sleep on the beaches along the ocean shores, next to the places where they work for most of their lives. The sheds are made of palm leaves and rotten wood, covered with plastic bags or various pieces of thorn cloth."" The Fishermen of Negombo - Photo: Nora De Angelli""There were no words that could have described the harshness of these peoples lives, the sad resignation and the sacrifice of their existences, but in the same time, the kindness and the candor of their smiles, which I got in return of mine.""Segueing into Documentary Film ProductionWhen she started exploring photography after her accident, De Angelli didn't have a clearly defined, beginning-to-end plan. She just kept learning and studying and things started falling into place. Then she made Worlds In Transformation, a 30-minute film that included a story made out of her images, which was her entry into documentary film production.While she studied for her Master at London College of Communication, the photographer made three powerful documentaries. She had the freedom to pick her own subjects: ""I tend to choose film subjects that combine a good story - usually involving a certain degree of mystery or some intriguing legend, built around a solid scientific truth - like in The Czech Torah Scrolls, great filming sets - I believe that the visual experience is equally important - like in Petra in Danger, and thirdly, I choose subjects that are close to my heart, that have been fascinated me for a long time like in the Romanian Monarchy.""A 30-minute version of the latter was screened in London at the Barbican, intriguing the audience and earning her critical praise.What's Next?De Angelli is working on two major projects she put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into. Both of them have one thing in common - the artist's home country, Romania.  The first one, to be published this year, is a scientific photographic album about the wild orchids of Romania, called The Magnificent World of Orchids - Illustrated by the Wild Orchids of Romania. It was photographed and written in collaboration with her father, Dan Anghelescu, and it's one of their lifetime dedication projects. Epipactis Purpurata Orchid - Photo: Nora De AngelliThe artist explained: ""Because the wild alpine orchids are the most elusive of all plants, it took us more than 25 years to find and photograph the wild species of Romanian orchids, equally found all over Europe, alongside other 700 species of rare and endemic alpine plants, that we intend to publish subsequently."" Cypripedium calceolus - Photo: Nora De Angelli""This first bilingual album (in English and Romanian) is an insight into the magnificent world of Orchidaceae family, an over view of the history of their discovery, the myths and symbolism they inspired along the millennia, and the intriguing anatomical adaptations these plants designed to allure and fool their pollination insects in order to reproduce. It's a dynamic, modern story of the Orchidaceae family, full of unexpected facts, which will unveil the most unbelievable truths about these surprising and spectacular plants. I hope it will be a joyful discovery for the public.""The second project is the feature length documentary about the Romanian Monarchy, which she's about to finish this year. The film turns one of the most important pages in the Romanian history, covering the untold story of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen Royal Dynasty of Romania, and the way they changed their adoptive country's course of history.As she advances in her new career, De Angelli remains humble and grounded. She's very much aware of her ongoing learning process, even though she has come a long way: ""No matter how hard or difficult it will be at times, I consider myself privileged to be a part of such an enriching and rewarding undertaking.""A bit hesitant in her humility when asked to give a piece of advice to aspiring photographers, De Angelli said: ""Giving advice is a very hard task in many ways.

19,QUEER VOICES,Here's Why You Need To Know Broadway And TV Star Andy Mientus,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andy-mientus-54-below_n_6618634.html,,2015-02-07,"NEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 22: Andy Mientus performing in a preview of 'The Cast Od Les Miz' at 54 Below on January 22, 2015 in New York City. (Photo by Walter McBride/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd5a52400005000551a40.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In many respects, Andy Mientus became a Broadway star in spite of himself. Although he can be seen as Marius in the current revival of ""Les Misérables,"" the 28-year-old actor-singer preferred the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Johnny Cash over show tunes as a teen. His early turns in modern musicals like ""Big River"" and ""Spring Awakening"" allowed him to show off pop, rock and folk stylings not usually associated with live theater. ""I'm not from a musical family, we didn't go to musicals and didn't have those movies or those types of albums playing in our house,"" Mientus, best known for his role on NBC's Broadway dramedy ""Smash,"" told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""For a while, I thought that musicals were just a concert with a story. ['Les Misérables'] is the first time I've ever had vibrato onstage and gotten paid for it."" As it turns out, Mientus isn't the only ""Les Misérables"" cast member whose music collection isn't defined by the likes of Jerry Herman and Stephen Sondheim. The company's diverse talents have inspired a special Feb. 8 show, ""The Cast of 'Les Miz' in Concert: Beyond the Barricade,"" at New York's 54 Below. Mientus performs at 54 Below in 2013. For two back-to-back performances, Mientus will join cast mates Caissie Levy, Kyle Scatliffe, Erin Clemmons, Andrew Kober and others for a set featuring pop, folk, bluegrass and soul. The night (which Mientus describes as ""a little show-and-tell of what we really do"" and ""a schizophrenic mixture"") will have a beneficent cause, too, with proceeds supporting Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. ""What's cool about our 'Les Miz' revival, I think, is that when they were casting it, they really sought to just cast the characters based on how they were portrayed in the original Victor Hugo novel without too much attention given to the voice type that people were used to, the skin color that people were used to or the physical type and age of actors that people were used to in these roles,"" he said. ""Aside from being a benefit, the purpose of the 54 Below show is to give the actors a change to sing the kind of music that we sing in our own time."" The Feb. 8 shows are also a fitting parting gift for Mientus, who plans to perform ""Helplessness Blues"" by the Fleet Foxes. After a yearlong stint in ""Les Misérables,"" he'll depart the musical on March 1 and is slated be replaced by his understudy, Chris McCarrell. Two days later, he'll reunite with ""Smash"" co-stars Jeremy Jordan and Krysta Rodriguez at 54 Below for ""This Will Be Our Year,"" before he returns to Los Angeles, where he and fiancé Michael Arden, also a Broadway and TV star, currently reside. (As far as the wedding is concerned, the openly bisexual Mientus said he and Arden are aiming for ""something small, intimate and personal"" and while no official date had been set, the couple expects it will happen this year)Mientus (left) says he and fiancé Michael Arden will marry later this year.  The California move makes sense for other reasons, too, as Mientus has had the good fortune of bouncing back between stage and TV roles over the past few years. Most recently, he starred in two well-received episodes of The CW's superhero series, ""The Flash,"" as the Pied Piper, an openly gay and beloved villain from the original DC comic books. Describing his two-episode arc as ""a real crash course in the comic book world,"" Mientus is hopeful the character will return in future episodes. ""He's one of the only out [gay] characters in the DC Comics universe, and he's incredibly complex and really fascinating. He goes back and forth between his good and bad sides so you never really know what team he's playing for,"" he said. ""Hopefully I've done the fans proud."" Mientus will perform at New York's 54 Below on Feb. 8 as part of ""The Cast of 'Les Miz' in Concert: Beyond the Barricade."" He'll return to the venue on March 3 for ""This Will Be Our Year."" "
20,BLACK VOICES,The Significance of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day,"Debra Y. Fraser-Howze, ContributorSenior Vice President of Government and External Affairs at Or...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-significance-of-national-black-hivaids-awareness-day_b_6625210.html,"Now in its 15th year, National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day is meant to spark conversations within our community and promote education about the disease, but why? With observance days like National HIV Testing Day and World AIDS Day, why is it important to have a day dedicated to the Black population?",2015-02-07,"WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 07: HIV/AIDS awareness bracelets and buttons sit in a basket to be given away at the Whitman-Walker Health mobile testing vehicle on National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day February 7, 2013 in Washington, DC. The HIV prevalence rate in the District of Columbia is at an epidemic level at nearly 3 percent, among the highest for any U.S. city, with nearly 15,000 adults in the district living with HIV or AIDS. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae05f124000050009650c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"HIV/AIDS continues to plague the African American CommunityNow in its 15th year, National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day is meant to spark conversations within our community and promote education about the disease, but why? With observance days like National HIV Testing Day and World AIDS Day, why is it important to have a day dedicated to the Black population?HIV and AIDS affect African Americans, more than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. According to the CDC, 1 in 16 African American men and 1 in 32 African American women will be diagnosed with HIV in his or her lifetime. Despite advances in testing and protection, there continues to be more than 50,000 new HIV infections every year, with the majority, around 41 percent, belonging to African Americans.Back in the '80s at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, I spent some years at the Urban League in New York City dealing with health issues for our youth. It was there that I was informed that a young man was infected with HIV and had a partner in one of our teenage pregnancy programs. He had infected both the young woman and her child. I realized that with teenage pregnancy on the rise back then, our young people were not using condoms as birth control, which made it clear that they were also at risk for HIV. Here we are, 30 years later, and although teen pregnancies have decreased nation wide we are still facing the same challenge with unprotected sex and our young people.Why are the numbers so high?One would expect that with so much education about HIV and AIDS people should know how to protect themselves and those they love from contracting this disease. One reason the numbers are high is that there are still many misconceptions about the disease. One of the most common misconceptions is that the epidemic is over. Yes, people are living longer and healthier lives thanks to advances in medicine, but the risk of contracting HIV is still high if proper precautions aren't taken. People are also visual, when we saw images recently of people dying from Ebola we understood it, in the '80s we saw people dying from AIDS and we understood it. Today, young people up to the age of 30 were all born before the AIDS epidemic and did not see the tragedy that occurred, so they have a different visual reference and think that the epidemic is either over or the disease is ""not that bad."" Finally, we have not been the best of public health servants and still have a lot of politics in this epidemic leading to homophobia, racism, and a lack of resources to the hardest hit communities for badly needed local agencies. So there is not as much out there as people believe in the way of support and education. The good news it that we can fix all of this.What can be done?The first step in reducing these numbers is to know your status. According to the CDC, more than 1.2 million Americans have HIV and nearly 1 in 7 don't even know they are infected. In 2015, there is no reason not to know your HIV status. For many, especially teens and young adults, cost of a test can be an issue. There are clinics that offer free testing in many areas. Enter your zip code here to find the location nearest to you.There is also now an HIV test sold at drug stores that you can take in the privacy of your own home, which provides results in only 20 minutes. For those who are not fond of needles, this test uses oral fluid from a mouth swab, no blood necessary. Those who are sexually active should be tested at least once a year. If you are engaging in any type of risky behavior, test more often and stop engaging in risky behavior!Remove the stigmaShare your stories about testing. Open the conversation about safe sex. The more it's talked about as a routine part of wellness, the less intimidating it will be. Raise your voice on the issue in your community, whether in social media or directly with a friend or partner and even in church. Sex should not continue to be a taboo subject in our community -- after all, that is how we all got here."

He said that he was actually riding in the helicopter behind the one that was hit, and had confused the events of 12 years ago.Soldiers on that mission, however, told Stars and Stripes that Williams was nowhere near the helicopter that was shot down, and was traveling in a different formation altogether.Now a video from 2007 has surfaced in which Williams claims that the RPG fired at his helicopter, in addition to downing the one in front of him, and that he was close enough to stare down the barrel of the weapon.""I've been very, very lucky the way my life has turned out,"" Williams said in an interview with Fairfield University Student Television, after making an appearance on campus:I've been very lucky to have survived a few things that I've been involved in. At the reception a few minutes ago, I was remembering something I tend to forget: the war with Hezbollah in Israel a few years back where there were Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in. A few years before that, you go back to Iraq, and I looked down the tube of an RPG that had been fired at us and had hit the chopper in front of ours. And I'm so fortunate to be sitting here.NBC News is conducting an internal investigation into Williams' statements about the helicopter attack.
