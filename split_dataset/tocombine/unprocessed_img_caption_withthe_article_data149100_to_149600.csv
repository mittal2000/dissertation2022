3,CRIME,Zimmerman Verdict Exposes Deficiencies in U.S. Self-Defense Law,"Amy Dash, Contributor

Zimmerman was morally wrong, but he prevailed in a legal sense.",2013-07-14,"SANFORD, FL - JULY 13: A sign showing support for Trayvon Martin is stuck in the lawn in front of the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center where a jury is deliberating in the trial of George Zimmerman on July 13, 2013 in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, is on trial for the February 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c4fd2100003300c65be6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How can a teenage boy be dead and the man who killed him walk free with no legal consequences? That's the question people across this nation are struggling with. Those who believe George Zimmerman should have been found guilty and those who believe the verdict was correct, share the same somber feeling that something is wrong. Even though the judicial process ran its course, and upheld the present meaning of the black letter law, something feels wrong about the outcome. What's wrong? The law lacks a charge to deal with the factual circumstances that the Zimmerman case presented. Now that George Zimmerman was found not guilty, legal experts and media commentators are calling the case a tragedy, not a crime. The killing of Trayvon Martin was undoubtedly a crime even though the black letter law may not retain a category for it. Killing a human being is always a crime, though sometimes it may be justified. How can the killing of a teenager who was walking home, minding his own business by a man who pursued him with a gun be justified? Morality shapes the law; the law does not shape morality. What can come from this case? An evolution in the law. Clearly, self-defense theory under the law does not take into account a situation where an aggressor places himself in a position that later requires him to invoke self-defense. Those who believe Zimmerman should have been found guilty, overwhelmingly point to the fact that Zimmerman was told by a 911 operator not to get out of his car and not to pursue Martin, but did anyway. Those who believe Zimmerman should have been found guilty, overwhelmingly point to the fact that he was the aggressor. The problem is that there was no appropriate crime to charge him with given the facts. Prosecutors picked second-degree murder because that's the charge they thought they had the best shot with. Prosecutors said Zimmerman racially profiled Martin made to try to prove malicious intent. The defense easily undermined prosecutor's claims that Zimmerman maliciously murdered Martin by painting him as the neighborhood watchman, who set out to protect his neighbors, after they had been inflicted by a series of past crimes. The jurors had no way of knowing whether the intent to kill Martin existed in Zimmerman's heart and mind. Thus, there were grounds for reasonable doubt under the facts. Prosecutors faced a losing proposition, not because no crime was committed, but because the crime committed in this case is not easy to prosecute given the current statutes. By calling the facts a tragedy and not a crime, media commentators and legal experts are surrendering morality to the law, when morality should govern the law. The law is not absolute; it lives, it breathes and it evolves. This case surfaced to illustrate that the law requires change. In every legal case, attorneys must prove a chain of causation existed connecting an action to a result in order to pin liability for a crime on an individual, as its cause. Intervening actions may interrupt the chain and absolve someone of partial or complete liability. In the George Zimmerman case however, you can say that ""but for"" George Zimmerman pursuing Trayvon Martin, Trayvon Martin would be alive today. There is direct causation. Self-defense theory, an affirmative defense, introduces a whole new set of considerations. Self-defense theory stunts the chain of causation. Rather than the timeline beginning with Zimmerman disobeying the 911 operators directives, now the timeline begins with the physical altercation. The ""Stand Your Ground"" considerations erase the significance of all events leading up to the altercation. Under traditional self-defense theory, all that matters is who threw the first punch. Under Florida's Stand Your Ground law, all that matters is who had the upper hand. The George Zimmerman case brings to our attention that there is no liability for instigation, verbal, mental or emotional abuse. All of the aforementioned are actions and all of the aforementioned can be just as severe, just as infuriating and just as criminal as throwing the first punch. Bullying has become a topic of heated debate and concern in society. It is impossible in this day and age to deny the effects of bullying or to deny that pursuing, antagonizing, and pushing someone's buttons can drive even the most controlled and disciplined people to express their frustration through physical force. How often have we heard psychologists postulate that years of bullying and social awkwardness may have been the driving forces behind some of the most appalling mass murders and school shootings in our country over the past decade? And yes, a neighborhood watchman can be the bully. The bottom line is that self-defense law is outdated. Self-defense law codifies the notion that physical actions create a crime. Now we must figure out how to codify when other types of aggression create liability without self-defense acting as a barrier. Older people, smarter people, stronger people may have an advantage when dealing with slower people, weaker people, younger people. Knowing which buttons to push can be a powerful tool in driving someone to act in ways that are uncharacteristic, including getting violent. How many cases have we seen where women who have been victims of years of domestic abuse, both physical, emotional and psychological one day snap and kill their abuser? The law considers those factors, but in the George Zimmerman case, the instigator is not held liable. As an adult, Zimmerman also should have been held to a higher standard when pursuing and antagonizing someone younger. Instead, the case focused entirely on who had the physical advantage and defense experts said that was Martin because he was ""younger"" and ""stronger."" What about who had the advantage when it came to wisdom and life experience? What about who should have known better? As a lawyer, I believe the jury did do a superb job of applying the facts to the law. The jury delivered a verdict that fits with the law and the instructions they were handed. According to self-defense law, Zimmerman had the right to defend himself when he reportedly found himself straddled and physically attacked by Martin. The fact that Zimmerman started the whole ordeal by inappropriately pursuing Martin became irrelevant. Again, the problem was that there was no charge and no codified instructions that would have allowed the jury to apply the fact that Zimmerman was the original aggressor to their determination. It is worth mentioning that when cases like this one are given to a Judge and not a jury, other types of provocation are usually considered, even though not specifically stated in the statute. n the Supreme Court case of Beard v. U.S., the court stated that a man ""was entitled to stand his ground,"" in part because he ""did not provoke the assault."" It does not say physically provoke or throw the first punch; it merely says provoke the assault. Think about it this way: Even if we are just dealing with a physical fight, two people cannot claim self-defense. One person must have been the aggressor and one must have thrown the first punch. To conclude, as the jury did, that Zimmerman invoked self-defense, the jury essentially concluded that Martin threw the first punch and because Martin is dead and there were no eyewitnesses, there is no one to say otherwise. What if Martin had grabbed Zimmerman's gun and shot and killed him? The facts surely would have supported Martin's claim of self-defense because Zimmerman was the one who pursued him with a gun. By reversing the scenario and pretending Martin had been on trial for Zimmerman's death, we can expose the glaring weakness that exists in the law. Either one could have been found to have acted in self-defense on these facts even though only one of them truly could have in reality. The fact that Zimmerman pursued Martin with a gun, would have been defining facts in moving a jury to acquit Martin of murder, had he been the one who had survived. Yet, because he died, those same facts became irrelevant in the self-defense analysis applied to Zimmerman. A law that is effective should operate equally and provide the same result no matter who ""wins"" the fight. The self-defense law must change because it puts whoever dies at a disadvantage when it is intended to deliver justice. There is no stronger example for such change than this case. To be killed when you are picking up skittles and a fruit drink and walking home is not just a tragedy, it is a crime. Our present law left the jurors no choice but to rule the way they did. We'll never know who actually threw the first punch. Zimmerman was morally wrong, but he prevailed in a legal sense. Those two principles should not be in conflict, they should be in harmony. If they are, that nagging feeling that the outcome was legally just but morally unjust will go away next time a verdict is delivered in a case like this."

Clad with khaki-pants and a navy-blue hoodie, his final gesture was a stunned glance into the eyes of the thief who had stolen his life. When the oxygen left his body, his heart would remain on the grass. This story, this drama, this scene: it is not new to us. We have seen it before: in the monstrous cheeks of Emmett Till, the bullet-soaked body of Amadou Diallo, the broken neck of Anthony Baez, the violated rectum of Abner Louima and the incapacitated vehicle of Sean Bell. The stories attached to these broken bodies occupy familiar spaces in the collective memory of Black America. The paralyzing sadness (and teetering rage) that now hangs in the air (in response to an all-white jury verdict) is also not new. It reminds us of the Scottsboro Boys verdict and the Rodney King verdict. It reminds us of the Sean Bell verdict and the Oscar Grant verdict. It feels like yesterday. It feels like tomorrow. Indeed, Trayvon Martin reminds us of yesterday, a yesterday that -- like the ghost in Toni Morrison's Beloved -- keeps coming back. Thus, to be black in contemporary America is to wrestle with this history of cyclical mourning and cyclical anticipation. The racial pain of yesterday is never far enough behind us, while the redemptive promise of a better tomorrow always seems too far ahead of us. The story of Trayvon Martin: his life, his death, and his trial (and surely he was on trial as much if not more than George Zimmerman) -- resonates with black America because it is laden with symbolic meanings. Indeed, Martin's body seems to signify something to us, it speaks to us and symbolizes a set of broader realities. There are three symbolic meanings attached to Martin's body which resonate with Black America. For many, Martin's untimely death symbolizes the ""stolen life"" that black male youth too often find themselves subjected to. By ""stolen life"" (a phrase that I borrow from critic Fred Moten) I am referring to the ways that young black boys frequently find their lives ripped out of their hands unexpectedly -- whether it be as a causality of the prison industrial complex (and the social death that follows) or a literal corpse in the wake of violent crime. Thus, to be young and black in America is to be a constant candidate for catastrophe. As we mourn and remember Trayvon Martin, many of us are also mourning the loss of brothers, fathers and sons whose lives have been stolen from them and stolen from us. For others, Martin's story provides a context for understanding the simmering rage that many black men feel towards law enforcement in particular and the legal system more generally. It is clear that justice has failed the Martin family on every structural level. Indeed, the Martin family is a victim of at least three systematic failures of justice. The initial failure took place in the moment that Trayvon Martin's heart was pierced by George Zimmerman's bullet. This failure was then bolstered by the failure of Florida law enforcement to arrest Zimmerman (thus setting the stage for the presumption that the loss of teenage black life is too tiny an offense to warrant legal consequence). Indeed, it is worth remembering that it was not until a full-fledged social movement had already been mounted -- on the web, in the streets and on television -- did the Sanford Police Department find it appropriate to take Zimmerman into custody. The final blow came in the form of the trial itself: a judge unwilling to permit race as an admissible area of consideration (or grant the state an opportunity to argue that Zimmerman had engaged in child-abuse); a prosecutorial team that seemed well-intentioned but entirely ill-prepared, and a jury utterly void of racial diversity. Taken together, all of these failures lead back to one staggering reality: for African Americans, the law is often a site of violence rather than a site of violence's retribution. Lastly, Trayvon Martin's story symbolizes the continued catastrophe of race in the age of Obama: an age where claims of racial suffering have become more (rather than less) illegible in the eyes of the American public. What does it mean to live in a nation where a 51-year-old black Harvard Law graduate can make it to the White House, but an unarmed 17-year-old black teenager cannot make it home alive? What it means is that we are living in the age of farcical racial irony: glass ceilings are broken, but the faces at the bottom of the well remain the same. Thus, to be black in contemporary America is to wrestle with the profound absurdity of this newer form of Dubosian double consciousness.The story of Trayvon Martin reminds us that in spite of the seductive rhetoric of post-racialism, America remains a blues nation with a blues people sitting at its center."

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bade8b224000051009647a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The moment George Zimmerman was acquitted, the NAACP and the Reverend Al Sharpton immediately called on U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to bring civil rights charges against him. The Justice Department has already conducted an exhaustive investigation to determine whether Zimmerman killed Martin out of racial animus. It found no evidence of that. That's one hard and fast requisite for a civil rights prosecution. The other is that the state so bungled the prosecution of a defendant that in effect it nullified the intent of the law, namely to insure that justice was truly served. On the surface, this doesn't appear to be the case with Zimmerman.Still, the call for Holder to strongly consider a federal prosecution is the right call. There are several factors within federal law that federal prosecutors must look at to determine whether there is a ""compelling interest"" in a second prosecution of a defendant who's been acquitted in a state court. It must involve a substantial federal interest, the state prosecution must not have vindicated that interest, the government must believe that the defendant's conduct could constitute a federal offense, and that there is still sufficient evidence against the defendant that the government can obtain a conviction. There are clear elements of each of these hard federal prosecution requirements in the Zimmerman case. The compelling interest is probably the easiest of the requisites to satisfy. The defense and prosecution agreed that Martin did not commit a crime, was not even suspected of a crime, and was on a public thoroughfare when he was killed. The right to freedom of movement without the danger of undue harm is a fundamental right that's enshrined in constitutional law and public policy. It's inviolate. The courts have repeatedly upheld a citizen's right to freedom of access and movement in public places. Though there was no apparent racial motive in Zimmerman's confronting Martin, his action clearly violated Martin's right to exercise his freedom of movement. This directly impacts on an individual's right to life and liberty. This civil right was violated the moment Zimmerman presumed that a young black man walking on public sidewalk had committed a crime. The safeguard of that right must be a fundamental concern of federal prosecutors. The Martin case also strongly pointed to systemic issues of excessive force, the excessive force being the slaying of Martin. This strikes to the heart of another basic right of citizens, namely the right to life and liberty, and again the freedom from undue harm. There was audio evidence that strongly hinted that it was Martin who was screaming for help and therefore was under physical assault from Zimmerman. Therefore it was his life, not Zimmerman's, that was in mortal danger. This is sufficient cause for federal prosecutors to question whether the jury ignored the that Martin was likely the victim, and Zimmerman was likely the assailant. This is one of the basic ingredients in determining whether the jury nullified a compelling prosecution fact. The Martin case raised deeply troubling questions about the power of the law to protect citizens from their unimpeded right to life and safety. Federal prosecutors play a major role in insuring that where there's the suspicion that an individual's rights might have been violated solely because of their race and gender that the power of federal law is brought to bear to insure that right is protected. Zimmerman was not a police office and did not abuse his power in killing Martin under the color of law. However, he was acting in a quasi-legal capacity as a one-time neighborhood watchman who had close ties and collaboration with local law enforcement. This in effect bestowed on him the presumption of authority to take action to stop and question an individual he considered a crime suspect. This was the rationale that federal prosecutors used in the Rodney King beating case to bring civil rights charge against the four LAPD officers that beat King. The linchpin was that they acted in an official capacity when they violated King's rights.The Justice Department scrupulously tries to avoid a dual prosecution of a defendant acquitted in a state court. It goes to great lengths to shield itself from the charge that it's bowing to media or public pressure to prosecute. This is why the percentage of civil rights prosecutions it authorizes is infinitesimally low. Yet in the Martin slaying there are crucial federal interests in insuring the rights of individuals to be free from undue harm because of their color, age, and being in a public area merely because someone perceives they shouldn't be in and then acts on that perception with no cause other than that belief or perception. If the Justice Department gives serious consideration to the civil rights violations in the Martin case, it will again send the strong message that civil rights violations will always be subject to full and public scrutiny by federal prosecutors. This is exactly why Attorney General Holder has a more than compelling reason to consider a Zimmerman civil rights prosecution.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

I'm still having a hard time grasping the magnitude of what this day will represent in the history of the Black experience in this country. By the time you are born, Trayvon Martin's story will be etched in our collective memory. His name will be synonymous with Emmett Till. Trayvon Martin's murder will serve as an example of how little value is placed on the lives of young, Black boys in this place you will eventually call home. Tonight, my sons, a bounty has been placed on your head. Your price: Worthless. Over the last 17 months, I've listened to Trayvon's peers, his fellow young people in Miami, express their feelings of rage, fear, and hopelessness reacting to this trauma. These children witnessed one of their own killed for no reason. These children have watched their identities being scrutinized, constantly criticized for the way they dress, the way they speak, the way they articulate being young and Black and urban. Trayvon could have easily been one of my students. They've asked, ""Ms. Walker, what can we do to change the world? It has always been this way, why should I believe that it will ever be any different?"" Staring back at their faces, knowing that they are at their wits end and out of answers, I've imagined you, years from now, asking me the same thing. I'm trying my best to craft an answer that is both actionable and honest, but I can't think of anything good enough to say that will erase those nagging questions, because I continue to grapple with them myself... and it still brings me to tears. I should not weep for children who are not born yet, but I am afraid I cannot protect you. It's 2013, but I know I will have to teach you to divert your eyes. I know I will have to teach you how to take the natural bass out of your voices. I know I will have to teach you how to temper your passion... to box up your genuine outrage. I'd hoped by the time you came around Audre Lorde's quote, ""We were never meant to survive"" would not frame your existence. Unfortunately, after tonight, someone will still have to school you.I am confident of your beautiful spirits. If you have even an ounce of me in you, you'll naturally be inclined to be vocal. I just don't want it to cost you your life. Even as a Black woman, it has been tricky for me to find that balance between maintaining my authenticity of self and ""social respectability."" I'm still trying to rationalize and reconcile how I will tell you that you have the capabilities to be absolutely anything you want to be, while simultaneously schooling you about what it means to exist as an outsider, bound within the walls of a country that despises your presence.  MY BEAUTIFUL, BLACK BOYS!!! I love you already more than you'll ever know, and you're not even here yet. At the same time, I'm terrified to bring you into this world. I don't want to believe that you are better off where you are. Tonight, as generations before me have done, I will continue to hold on to hope. I will continue to believe that we can and will survive this blatant assault to our identity. I will close my eyes and pray that we shall overcome, but I want to equip you with those invaluable tools that you will need if you are ever pulled over driving home from school; or watched closely while shopping in a store; or followed home after taking a trip to the local gas station for a mid-game snack: a bag of Skittles and an Arizona Iced Tea.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bade8b13c000020010b536b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fifty years ago, on Wednesday, September 18, 1963, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. arose to speak from the pulpit of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Near the altar before him rested three small caskets containing the mutilated bodies of three young girls, Addie Mae Collins (age 14), Cynthia Wesley (age 14), and Denise McNair (age 11). The three girls, along with Carole Robertson (age 14), were casualties of a domestic terrorist event that previous Sunday morning as a bomb was detonated at their church near the women's restroom. As he delivered their eulogy, Dr. King sought to provide solace for the families of the deceased and to provide strength to a deeply grieving community and nation. King also sought to add a sense of dignity and greater meaning to the tragic death of these children.Not even a full month prior, Dr. King arose to speak of his dream for America upon the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. King spoke, ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."" King's hopes for his own four children would not be realized in the four girls being eulogized. In what history now records as ""Eulogy for the Martyred Children"", Dr. King prophetically and eloquently addressed the nation. Concerning the young girl's enduring legacy, Dr. King spoke, ""...They have something to say to each of us in their death...They say to us that we must be concerned not merely about who murdered them, but about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderers."" Unfortunately, Dr. King's words, again, ring true as a family, a community, a nation, and the international community mourns, anew, not only the tragic killing of 17-year-old Travyon Martin, but now the acquittal of his killer, George Zimmerman. While Zimmerman was the perpetrator of this heinous crime, we would do well to recognize that Zimmerman was not Trayvon Martin's greatest threat. Nor was Zimmerman the sole perpetrator on that fateful night. The greatest threat to Trayvon Martin, and to young black boys all across this nation, is the ""system,"" with its prevailing philosophies, that galvanized Zimmerman's deadly interests. The system would not allow Zimmerman to see what reality was: a black boy walking by himself at night. Instead, the system's philosophies, rooted in our nation's dark racial history, immediately categorized Trayvon Martin as both criminal and dangerous without cause. The system also justified Zimmerman's deadly actions in his mind. Despite a 911 operator's clear instruction to stay in his vehicle and not to approach Trayvon, an armed Zimmerman, informed by the system, could not risk allowing this one to get away. While our nation has been closely following the Zimmerman trial, the system has continued to try, convict, and even execute other black boys without cause, both inside our nation's courts and upon our nation's streets. Disturbingly, in our nation, being a black boy and walking in a gated community is a capital offence. In our nation, being a black boy in a car with friends listening to music is a capital offence, as evidenced by the death of Jordan Davis. For these young black boys, and countless others, were tried, convicted, and executed by a system that finds their black masculinity as an offense, per se, rendering the victims guilty until proven innocent. Although Zimmerman fired the gun and should have been held accountable for his actions, the true murderer is the system that both galvanized him, and then declared him, ""not guilty"". Upon the conclusion of the trial for the brutal murder of her son, Emmett Till, Mamie Till offered these chilling words: ""The whole trial was just a farce, but the verdict was one that I expected."" No parent should ever be made to feel that their child's death was inconsequential. Like Mamie Till before them, and countless other parents of black boys throughout the years, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton now assuredly feel this pain. The exceeding cruelty of the system is the anticipation of injustice by the victims' families, the assertion that the life of their black boys did not matter.It is worth noting that four little girls were not the only children to die that fateful Sunday in 1963. Also murdered that day in Birmingham was a young black boy named Virgil Ware, 13. He was shot in the face and chest. His crime? Riding on the handlebars of his brother's bicycle in the wake of the bombing.  Apparently, being a black boy and riding a bike is a capital offence, too.Dr. King brought the eulogy to a close with a nod to Shakespeare. He spoke, ""And today, as I stand over the remains of these beautiful, darling girls, I paraphrase the words of Shakespeare: 'Good night, sweet princesses. Good night, those who symbolize a new day. And may the flight of angels take thee to thy eternal rest.'"" And while I bid sweet rest to our beautiful princes Emmett, Virgil, Trayvon and Jordan, and peace to their families, it is this cruel and corrupt system that I hope to soon eulogize."

We know a better world, a better society, a better government is possible yet our leaders continue to fail us. Sometimes, taking a step back and clearing your head from the political circus is the best thing you can do for yourself. It's summer and thousands of people are doing just that, gathering at festivals across the country to camp, be in nature, dance, wear their most colorful garb, enjoy art, music and experience a different kind of community. This needed escape is not only a place to party, heal, and recharge, it is an environment that models the kind of community that we all know is possible. A cooperative instead of competitive environment where people enjoy the best aspects of art and culture to experience and envision a glimpse of our potential as a society. Let's take a journey through a few diverse realms of festival life in America today and consider the ways that these gatherings are shaping our culture for the better.The festival phenomena is not without precedent. Cultures around the world have been gathering in celebration of life, the changing seasons, the planting and harvesting since the beginning of time. It is only in our modern world, where people have been convinced that anything worth having can be purchased, that we have forgotten the importance of creating our own sense of meaning, community, and personal/collective expression. Expression is something much different than consumption as it creates personal renewal from the empowered feeling that one can give back to rather than only take from the world around them. Great festivals encourage this reciprocity from their patrons and this is a powerful way to shape culture without waiting for politicians. Unlike a sporting event with a defined winner and loser, festivals create a collective ""win"" for everyone who participates.Going back through the decades we have Newport Jazz and Newport Folk Festivals, Mardi Gras, rodeos, and pow-wows, but things get real interesting after the cultural renaissance of the 60's. Let's look at some events that combine the old and new world expressions of festivals from Rainbow Gatherings and Woodstock to Burning Man. According to Wikipedia, ""Rainbow Gatherings and the Rainbow Family are an expression of a Utopian impulse, combined with bohemianism, hipster and hippie culture, with roots clearly traceable to the counterculture of the 1960s."" Thousands of people come together to observe their First Amendment Rights to gather peacefully on public lands in a primitive ""city"" that is carried in and out of the wilderness by foot. It is no surprise that Hopi Elder David Monogye, visited a Rainbow Gathering in 1977 near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico riding in on a donkey to address the gathering. He spoke of ""The Hopi Life Plan"" and the prophecies that tell of people coming together from all walks, all religions, all cultures and all colors of the rainbow to restore and heal the hoop of life on earth. Monongye was almost 100 years old when he spoke at The Rainbow Gathering and this exchange merged Hopi cosmology, which is one of the oldest living cultures in North America, with a modern emergent form of expression. Hopi to Hippie.The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is perhaps the grandaddy of American music festivals. Started in 1970 as a celebration to the music and culture that defines America's melting pot of cultures. In America's City of Dreams along The Mississippi River, Gospel, Soul, Blues, Zydeco, Jazz, Funk, Rock, Tribal music along with the best Creole and Cajun food you have ever eaten make this event unforgettable each spring. Now in its 44th year, the event has perfected the art of cultural cross-pollination, as jazz and blues were born of the merging cultural expressions between settlers, indians, and slaves in the deep south. Photos Above: Living Folklore, known for their giant puppet parades and children's entertainment, celebrates the 40th Annual Telluride Bluegrass Festival. Top: The Ladybug Parade. Courtesy of Merrick Chase at Telluride PhotographyThe Telluride Bluegrass Festival just celebrated its 40th year in one of the worlds most beautiful mountain valleys in Colorado. Giant waterfalls, 14,000-foot peaks, aspens, and red rocks are a visual delight to compliment the world-class musical acts. The festival also boasts one of the oldest sustainability initiatives with compostable eating utensils, cups, carbon offset for travelers and more it has set an example for other festivals to strive to reduce their footprint on the environment.

We know a better world, a better society, a better government is possible yet our leaders continue to fail us. Sometimes, taking a step back and clearing your head from the political circus is the best thing you can do for yourself. It's summer and thousands of people are doing just that, gathering at festivals across the country to camp, be in nature, dance, wear their most colorful garb, enjoy art, music and experience a different kind of community. This needed escape is not only a place to party, heal, and recharge, it is an environment that models the kind of community that we all know is possible. A cooperative instead of competitive environment where people enjoy the best aspects of art and culture to experience and envision a glimpse of our potential as a society. Let's take a journey through a few diverse realms of festival life in America today and consider the ways that these gatherings are shaping our culture for the better.The festival phenomena is not without precedent. Cultures around the world have been gathering in celebration of life, the changing seasons, the planting and harvesting since the beginning of time. It is only in our modern world, where people have been convinced that anything worth having can be purchased, that we have forgotten the importance of creating our own sense of meaning, community, and personal/collective expression. Expression is something much different than consumption as it creates personal renewal from the empowered feeling that one can give back to rather than only take from the world around them. Great festivals encourage this reciprocity from their patrons and this is a powerful way to shape culture without waiting for politicians. Unlike a sporting event with a defined winner and loser, festivals create a collective ""win"" for everyone who participates.Going back through the decades we have Newport Jazz and Newport Folk Festivals, Mardi Gras, rodeos, and pow-wows, but things get real interesting after the cultural renaissance of the 60's. Let's look at some events that combine the old and new world expressions of festivals from Rainbow Gatherings and Woodstock to Burning Man. According to Wikipedia, ""Rainbow Gatherings and the Rainbow Family are an expression of a Utopian impulse, combined with bohemianism, hipster and hippie culture, with roots clearly traceable to the counterculture of the 1960s."" Thousands of people come together to observe their First Amendment Rights to gather peacefully on public lands in a primitive ""city"" that is carried in and out of the wilderness by foot. It is no surprise that Hopi Elder David Monogye, visited a Rainbow Gathering in 1977 near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico riding in on a donkey to address the gathering. He spoke of ""The Hopi Life Plan"" and the prophecies that tell of people coming together from all walks, all religions, all cultures and all colors of the rainbow to restore and heal the hoop of life on earth. Monongye was almost 100 years old when he spoke at The Rainbow Gathering and this exchange merged Hopi cosmology, which is one of the oldest living cultures in North America, with a modern emergent form of expression. Hopi to Hippie.The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is perhaps the grandaddy of American music festivals. Started in 1970 as a celebration to the music and culture that defines America's melting pot of cultures. In America's City of Dreams along The Mississippi River, Gospel, Soul, Blues, Zydeco, Jazz, Funk, Rock, Tribal music along with the best Creole and Cajun food you have ever eaten make this event unforgettable each spring. Now in its 44th year, the event has perfected the art of cultural cross-pollination, as jazz and blues were born of the merging cultural expressions between settlers, indians, and slaves in the deep south.

Courtesy of Merrick Chase at Telluride PhotographyThe Telluride Bluegrass Festival just celebrated its 40th year in one of the worlds most beautiful mountain valleys in Colorado. Giant waterfalls, 14,000-foot peaks, aspens, and red rocks are a visual delight to compliment the world-class musical acts. The festival also boasts one of the oldest sustainability initiatives with compostable eating utensils, cups, carbon offset for travelers and more it has set an example for other festivals to strive to reduce their footprint on the environment.

""The more impact you create, the more you earn. As your points rack up, redeem them for things like festival tickets, merchandise, memorabilia and completely ridiculous experiences.""With the help of the grand prize celebrities, the Urgency Network is working to raise funds and awareness for three important environmental and social causes. Users who want to meet McCartney and also help maintain a healthy frozen North can use the site to spread awareness about Greenpeace's Save The Arctic  project. This campaign aims to stop oil corporations from working in the Arctic.The Urgency Network is also sponsoring the Carbon War Room's Ten Island Renewable Challenge to help island countries transition off of fossil fuels and develop renewable energy models. Those who participate in this initiative have a chance to meet business mogul Richard Branson in Manhattan.Linkin Park decided to team up with the fundraising platform to support Music For Relief's Power The World, an initiative that aims to develop sustainable clean energy projects for energy poor regions.McCartney, Branson, and Linkin Park have all tweeted to support their various Urgency Network-sponsored causes.The site plans to feature several more campaigns and prizes soon, Deroche told The Huffington Post.The raffles for meeting Linkin Park and Paul McCartney end on August 1 while the chance to meet Richard Branson ends on September 10.
