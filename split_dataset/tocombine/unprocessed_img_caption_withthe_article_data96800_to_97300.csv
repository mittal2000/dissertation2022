The rapper brought up the paparazzi photos in which he's bending down on one knee adjusting Kim Kardashian's pant leg. West likened the photos to his approach to fashion: ""That's what I want to do for the world,"" West told Complex. ""I want to get on my knees and fix everyone’s pant leg, if they’ll have me. If they’ll have me make that adjustment.""To all of West's harsh critics in the fashion world, give the guy a break. He just wants to fix your pants.For the full interview, head to Complex."

2,BLACK VOICES,The Key to Solving the Black Jobs Crisis Is Organizing Black Workers,"Lola Smallwood Cuevas, ContributorFounder and acting director, LA Black Worker Center",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-key-to-solving-the-bl_b_6680816.html,"The cause of the Black job crisis is not just the economy. It's the lack of power. No matter how ""strong"" the economy, we are disproportionately unemployed and in low-wage jobs.",2015-02-15,"MIAMI, FL - AUGUST 23: Ronald Baker speaks with a job recruiter as he looks for a job at a job fair in the James L. Knight Center on August 23, 2011 in Miami, Florida. The job fair, known as 'For the People' Jobs Initiative, was organized by the Congressional Black Caucus and is part of a nationwide series of job fairs and town hall meetings. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae06b42200004301dad9bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Armed with extensive pre-apprenticeship certificates, Andre Hollins, a father of twin boys, searched nearly 2.5 years for work. By dawn, he would have already hit up multiple construction sites. He rarely saw people who looked like him. He wanted to give up. Instead he turned to Los Angeles Black Worker Center. What he discovered was his voice, his rights and the power of joining together with other Black workers to create change in the economy, and in the process, he also found a job.  ""All I hear is Black people don't want to work, don't have skills, are not trained,"" says Hollins, who currently works as a unionized carpenter in Los Angeles. ""The [real] issue is access and retention. We have to get together and make sure that the doors are opened for us to get into industries and access good jobs. This makes our community strong.""  Andre's story is not unique. If you go anywhere in this country you will hear stories of Black men and women who struggle to make ends meet for their families. These stories reflect the reality of the Black job crisis. This job crisis has two faces: beyond the face of joblessness, it is the face of being trapped in low-wage jobs. It is a brother who just got out of prison and can only find employment through a temp agency. It is the sister trying to juggle family, work, and school bouncing between jobs at McDonalds, WalMart and the Gap.  The cause of the Black job crisis is not just the economy. It's the lack of power. No matter how ""strong"" the economy, we are disproportionately unemployed and in low-wage jobs. In Los Angeles, more than 50 percent of Black working age adults are unemployed or in low-wage jobs. Across the nation, 38 percent of Black workers receive low-wages. It is a lack of power that allows these outcomes to occur and these outcomes destabilize our families and the subsequent poverty is at the root of mass incarceration, homelessness, health disparities and the educational divide.Solving the Black jobs crisis means realizing Black people are not responsible for the racism that our people have had to endure for more than 100 years. Nor are we to blame for the horrific levels of Black unemployment and underemployment. Resisting stereotypes that focus on individual deficits or myths of black work ethic allows us to lift up new narratives focused on our right to quality jobs and full employment. Solving the Black jobs crisis means building power by organizing Black workers -- employed and unemployed -- to challenge organized money and power.  This organizing is taking place. Here in Los Angeles, the LA BWC worked with various community groups and labor unions to win passage of a historic Project Labor Agreement/Construction Careers Policy that includes a strong disadvantaged worker hiring clause and federal anti-discrimination and equal opportunity provisions. A Chicago-based Black worker center, the Worker Center for Racial Justice, worked with a coalition of groups to successfully campaign the state legislature to limit the ability of private firms to inquire about an applicant's incarceration history. In Canton, Mississippi, efforts to form a union at the local Nissan factory resemble 60s civil rights movement activism.  That this Black worker organizing is taking place at the same time as the larger upsurge in Black activism is not an accident. Last fall, these conditions brought 55 people from nine cities from around the United States to attend a conference to understand how to build Black worker centers. We forged a community dedicated to building a movement for Black economic justice as we shared our ""Black freedom dreams.""  At the end of the day, this is about making a difference in our peoples' lives. Consider LeDaya Epps. LeDaya lives in Compton and bounced around from job to job. She ran across the LA BWC at a job fair and became a member. She connected to a program and got placed on a job as a union apprentice, made possible because community groups and labor unions came together to win that historic policy I mentioned above.  We fight for LeDaya. We fight for our communities. And when we fight...we win. This post is part of the ""Black Future Month"" series produced by The Huffington Post and Black Lives Matter for Black History Month. Each day in February, this series will look at one of 28 different cultural and political issues affecting Black lives, from education to criminal-justice reform.

But other times, you need a little something extra. And when the media thinks that they've caught on to that ""something extra,"" they've got a term for it: the secret weapon.",2015-02-15,"Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, left, and First Lady Columba Bush, right, participate in the annual statewide drug summit on Wednesday, June 7, 2006, in Tallahassee, Fla. The summit provides a forum for drug control experts and law enforcement officials to discuss the Florida Drug Control Strategy and future drug prevention and treatment initiatives. (AP Photo/Phil Coale)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e8ab3c000032000dfeaa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every election cycle can be considered, first and foremost, a monument to hype. With every passing week, the political world is a blizzard of brash predictions, bold pronouncements, and bad advice. This year, your Speculatroners shall attempt to decode and defang this world with a regular dispatch that we're calling ""This Week In Coulda Shoulda Maybe."" We hope this helps, but as always, we make no guarantees!Sometimes, in life, you succeed on your own merits. But other times, you need a little something extra. And when the media thinks that they've caught on to that ""something extra,"" they've got a term for it: the secret weapon.If you look long enough, secret weapons abound. If you're in the National Hockey League, your secret weapon is the female figure skater. If you're the Super Bowl-bound New England Patriots, it's Tom Brady's patience. If you're producing the Grammys, then what you find in your ""in case of emergency break glass"" box is a gospel choir.Kanye West has a secret weapon. So does Beyonce. Both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates have them. Elon Musk has a secret weapon that he apparently won't tell anyone about. What if his secret weapon was ""a small firearm, secreted on his person?"" That would sure be a surprise to find out!There comes a time in the coverage of any election that you start to hear about the candidates and their ""secret weapons."" And nearly 100 percent of the time, the secret weapon is the same thing: the candidate's spouse. This is a thing that's said about nearly every candidate. Barack Obama's secret weapon is Michelle Obama. Mitt Romney's secret weapon is Ann Romney. The same is true for Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum and Ron Paul and Herman Cain and Tim Pawlenty. Senators got 'em. Governors got 'em. Even our favorite politicians from across the pond have got 'em. Sometimes it's awkward, like when you cheat on your secret weapon and father a son with your household staff. Sometimes it's a little bit weird, like when your predecessor's spouse becomes your secret weapon.Once campaigns end, with the winners in ascension and the losers in absentia, there is precious little discussion as to whether any of these spouses-as-secret-weapons actually worked or not. And why would there be? The brilliance of the ""spouse as secret weapon"" story is that it's a trope disguised as a scoop -- a tired exercise handed down from editor to reporter to blandly pass the time. There is not a person, in the history of the news, who has ever assigned this ""spouse as secret weapon"" story who would dare step forward in public and demand that we heed his case for having assigned it. And there's not a reporter in the world with the balls to tell you, truthfully, that the assignment was anything but bogus. (I dearly want someone -- anyone! -- to take on this task and present it literally. That is: a real, earnest accounting of how a candidate's spouse could potentially hurt another human being.)Already, this year, we've crossed the threshold, with Columba Bush getting a write-up in The Hill, depicting her as Jeb Bush's secret weapon. (""Don't publicly release a bunch of random people's Social Security numbers,"" is the sort of thing you'd kind of like your secret weapon to advise, but, alas!) He'll join a handful of other potential 2016ers who have already notched their spouses-as-secret-weapons stories. At some point, this story will be written about each of the remaining candidates.And so, with that in mind, we'd like to pay tribute to all the candidates who possess secret weapons that aren't their wives or husbands, and the reporters who dared to delve a little further to expose these armaments to their readers.Hillary Clinton's Secret Weapons: Eyewear. Grandchildren. Huma Abedin. Praise from Republicans. ""African-American voters and America's withdrawal from Iraq."" (Well, maybe not anymore on the latter. Perhaps America's intervention in Iraq can finally be her secret weapon!)Rand Paul's Secret Weapon: Hillary Clinton.Mike Huckabee's Secret Weapon: Also, Hillary Clinton. (I guess Rand gets her Monday-Wednesday-Friday and Huck gets her on Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday, and they alternate Sundays.)Ted Cruz's Secret Weapons: Iowa Rep. Steve King and ""Republican despair."" (Sort of the same concept, actually.)Rick Santorum's Secret Weapon: The churches of America. His movie studio.Scott Walker's Secret Weapon: Vanilla. (What else?)Joe Biden's Secret Weapon: Laughter. (What else?)___________________________So what is the 2016 election about this week?Vaccines! From NPR's Mara Liasson: ""Think vaccine politics are a very good mirror of the current dynamics in the 2016 presidential field. On the Republican side, the two candidates who've been doing really well lately, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, managed to navigate the crosscurrents of vaccine politics really well. The two candidates who've been floundering a bit couldn't. It's a hot potato for Republicans because even though there are plenty of rich, liberal, whole-food parents who don't vaccinate, it's a much more burning issue for the Republican grassroots. They're more likely to see it as an issue of individual freedom and liberty. ""Continuing The Obama Administration! Joe Biden: “That is what the next presidential election will be about. Do we continue on the path we are on or do we go back to the policies of the past?”Whether people like senators or like governors! The Hill: ""The Republican presidential primary is shaping up to be a battle between the statehouse and the statesmen.""Getting Drafty In HereFor as long as the 2016 campaign cycle and Sen. Elizabeth Warren have been things existing simultaneously, there has been an effort to bring about the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup-ization of the two. ""Oh, what? You got Elizabeth Warren in my 2016 election!"" And so, we have a long-standing ""Draft Elizabeth Warren"" campaign, which has bred an endless array of ""Is Elizabeth Warren going to finally jump into the race"" stories. But this may be the week when the ""Are The Draft Elizabeth Warren People Going To Get A New Hobby"" stories begin to flow. This week, one of the nascent ""convince Elizabeth Warren to launch a foolhardy campaign for the White House"" efforts, in concert with MoveOn, commissioned a push-poll, and Salon's Jim Newell utterly demolished it, saying, ""Credit to MoveOn for being transparent and sharing its methodology. On the other hand: oh my god, this is hilarious. We can’t believe they would share this! It’s the fluffiest poll since whatever the last really fluffy poll was.""Indeed, many of the poll questions make the typical push-poll look downright shy. Do you agree that Elizabeth Warren really wants to take it to big Wall Street interests? Isn't her middle-class backstory interesting? How about this report from Time magazine, which discusses her zealous defense of consumers? Isn't it a great thing to protect consumers? It all basically reads as, ""People have said Elizabeth Warren is amazing. Do you think America would benefit from an amazing president?""Per Newell:There’s a scientific term for this type of survey, can’t quite think of it now, but it’s not a kind one. The gist of it is “when your survey spends 11 questions puffing up someone into a quasi-deity and then immediately asks if people like that person, it’s not a very useful survey.” This isn’t how an election plays out. When New Hampshire Democrats enter the polling station on primary day, the voting machine will not read them a glowing profile of Elizabeth Warren before displaying the ballot. (Although who knows; these machines sometimes go on the fritz.)Elsewhere in Salon, Joan Walsh absorbs the news that New York's Working Families Party joined the Draft Warren movement, and gives it the side-eye it deserves:I admire WFP; I think they’re doing exactly what progressives should be doing: Working within the Democratic Party and pulling it to the left, not standing outside the party and declaring it no better than the GOP.Lots of people admire the effort that Elizabeth Warren undertakes to see to it that a basic level of fairness for normal human Americans is restored as we climb out of the post-crash wreckage. It's something that she works at very hard, on a daily basis. Maybe it's time for everyone working in the Draft Warren world to start doing the same.The Week In PredictionsHillary Clinton: One peril of Clinton taking her time to enter the race is that she will have to endure the periodic repetition of the ""all the advantages that Hillary Clinton enjoys may turn out to be impediments,"" as if the best possible way to run for office is to be burdened with disadvantages. This week, it's The Washington Post: ""But the luxury of front-runner status could easily become a liability as Clinton attempts the historically difficult feat of leading her party to a third consecutive term in the White House."" We are subsequently told that ""her advisers are working hard to fashion ways to make her seem hungrier, scrappier and less like the inheritor of Obama’s mantle."" Sure, but she'll still take being up 40 points on Joe Biden eight days a week!Rand Paul: The National Journal's Lauren Fox opines that the ""debate about defeating ISIS"" could become ""perilous"" for the Kentucky senator. Probably not as perilous as actually fighting ISIS though!Elizabeth Warren: The Hill's Judy Kurtz: ""A battle between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth Warren could easily divide entertainers, creating a showdown that might split Hollywood and force A-list stars to choose sides."" Good thing that Warren isn't running, I guess, though even if she did, at least Amy Pascal can't lose her job a second time.Joe Biden: He could win the Iowa Caucus, unless someone else does.All The Advice That's Fit To AggregateHillary Clinton should have her campaign headquarters in the Bronx. Or in Queens. (There's space available in Staten Island, too.) Hillary should jump into the race right now, and start doing some Teddy Roosevelt stuff. Also, David Axelrod has advice.Jeb Bush ""should think twice about playing to the Iowa GOP."" Rand Paul should ""come clean about libertarianism."" Chris Christie should ""stop telling the Sicilian mother story"" and get a makeover -- there are five to choose from. Bobby Jindal ""should salvage his legacy by giving up his presidential ambitions and focus on solving Louisiana's fiscal crisis,"" but where's the fun in that?This week, Jennifer Rubin says that Rick Perry's ""biggest problem may be [Scott] Walker, whom Perry will need to show is less prepared on foreign policy and less accomplished than he is."" That means next week, Rubin can flip the names and write the same sentence.We'll Leave You With This, Whatever This IsVia Bloomberg's Ben Brody:“If Jeb Bush loses New Hampshire, they'll get Mitt Romney back in the race,” said Carville, who managed Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. Clinton that year became the first modern president not to win the Granite State primary.""Mitt Romney will jump back into the race"" is the new ""Elizabeth Warren will challenge Hillary Clinton."""

The American conservative Union held its annual conference in the suburb of Washington, DC, to rally conservatives and generate ideas. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae06a7250000cf0037b22f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To Gov. Nimrata ""Nikki"" Haley and the South Carolina House of Representatives:""We are loyal sons and daughters Proud to own the name we bear For the truth that thou has taught us Ready all to do and dare--South Carolina State University alma materIn 1872, seven years after the Civil War, South Carolina Agricultural and Mechanical Institute was founded in Orangeburg, South Carolina. This institution would later become the Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina in 1896 after the 1890 second Morrill Land-Grant Act created separate land-grant colleges for African Americans in the Southern United States. The initial Morrill Act led to the founding of white agricultural institutions; however, potential African-American collegians were barred from entering those colleges and universities. Since 1896, according to the university's mission, South Carolina State University (SCSU) has committed to ""providing affordable and accessible quality baccalaureate programs"" and preparing ""highly skilled, competent, and socially aware graduates."" Additionally, South Carolina State University is the sole historically Black university in the South Carolina state college system, and it is the alma mater of noted historian Benjamin Elijah Mays and longtime U.S. Congressman James Clyburn. Judging by yesterday's decision to close South Carolina State on July 1, 2015, for at least one year, subcommittee members Jim Merrill and Kenny Bingham are obviously unaware of this history and legacy of service to the state of South Carolina. Bingham was quoted by WYFF Greenville as saying, ""I'm not supporting more money going to SC State University until they learn to live within their means."" It seems the financial issues plaguing South Carolina State exasperate Rep. Bingham. This is ironic considering historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have been underfunded since their inclusion into the fabric of the American educational system. From the time of their founding to the present day, HBCUs continue to struggle for adequate attention, funding, resources, opportunities, and respect from their state governing bodies. It seems South Carolina's legislature is no exception. We members of the HBCU community are watching the debacle that has become the South Carolina State proviso with bated breath and knowing eyes. We have seen this conversation happen far too many times about far too many of our institutions. For one university, a legislature recommends merging the historically Black college with a predominately white university. For another university, the suggestion is for the college to become a community college instead of a four-year institution. For still another historically Black college, the recommendation is to close university programs while offering those same programs at neighboring predominately white institutions. Still another suggestion is to ""temporarily"" suspend operations in order to repair financial or administrative issues. In each of these cases, those who claim to have the university's best interests at heart undermine the historical value of the HBCU. Usually, these ""thoughtful"" commentators have no connection to the university or its mission, purpose, objective, or values, for if they did, they would never suggest anything as insulting as limiting the university's academic potential. South Carolina State University might currently be experiencing financial issues, and the university does need a sustainability plan to lead them into the next 100 years of collegiate education, but closing the university is akin to needing a new roof and deciding to demolish the house instead. South Carolina State will not be served well by closure. In fact, closure will strip the university of its accreditation, which means current and prospective students will not be eligible for federal financial aid -- a necessary resource for many first-in-family college students. Closure would be a death knell for South Carolina State, and any legislator who believes differently is blinded by willful ignorance. HBCUs are not only colleges; HBCUs are relics of American history, harkening back to the time when this nation failed at reconstructing itself after the Civil War. HBCUs are the tangible reminder of what men can do when their hearts are united and purposed for a common goal. HBCUs are the soil in which freed and former slaves planted their hopes and dreams for American improvement. HBCUs are the places in which Black, brown, and white students can study in an environment conducive to each of their own needs and learning styles. HBCUs are purveyors of our history and time capsules of our culture. HBCUs are repositories of gifted Blackness, sites of resistance and struggle against oppression. HBCUs are the balm in Gilead, the city upon a hill, the light in darkness, the mountaintop, and the mecca. HBCUs are not, however, political tools used to usurp power and flex strength. In closing, Gov. Haley and South Carolina State House of Representatives, discard the existing proviso language calling for the closure of South Carolina State University and work with the university to develop a plan that ensures that this jewel of South Carolina continues to educate, prepare, empower, and develop public intellectuals into the next century and beyond.

(AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baec55b3c000066000b9025.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A ton of fun is being poked online at the unnamed guy caught on camera sitting on a sailboat, fixated on the screen of his cellphone. What he's obviously missing, as the picture by photographer Eric Smith shows, is the sight of the breaching humpback whale right alongside the boat.We may sneer at his inattention, but this image is really a teachable moment for us all, simply because we're all guilty of some form of cell-centric behavior.Every time we choose to stare into our little screens or nervously fiddle with our phones, whether for a second or an hour, we risk missing whatever may be happening immediately around us -- like, say, the breach of a whale, or, more ominously, a car that unexpectedly stops right in front of ours. Using a phone while walking is proving to be problematic too, and not just because of missing spectacular scenery (think stairs, escalators, walls, motorists checking their cellphones).The other side of this cellular coin is that we may also be missing out on what's going on in our very own heads -- or what would be going on if we weren't busy talking, texting, tweeting, emailing, gaming, Googling, scrolling through Facebook and watching cat videos. These phones we carry -- and check as often as we might scratch a pesky itch -- are about much more than making and receiving calls, although there's that too. Oh, wait just a sec; I've gotta take this call--Sorry! That was my cat's agent calling about this awesome video gig! Just another sec; I should probably tweet that. (Don't worry! I'm not walking or driving.) Anyway, the point is that these pocket-sized supercomputers we call smartphones and carry everywhere we go (admit it: You've texted while toileting!) can interfere with allowing our minds to simply wander. A variety of studies have made a case for unstructured mental downtime, and some tout the benefits of outright boredom, which is why it seemed oddly poignant that the image of that phone-fixated sailor began circulating around the same time as the obituaries for the esteemed physicist Charles Townes, who died Jan. 27, six months shy of his 100th birthday.While never a household name on the order of Einstein, Charlie Townes was a major figure in 20th-century physics, a Nobel laureate credited with, among other things, laying the scientific foundation for the development of the laser, a device that's become an indispensable tool in settings from supermarket checkout counters to surgical suites.Townes often told the story about how he came up with the idea for the predecessor of the laser, called the ""maser,"" for ""microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation."" (""Laser"" stands for almost the same thing, only with an ""l"" for ""light."") It occurred to me that if that picture of the whale-missing man is worth a thousand words, Townes' story is certainly worth a few too. Better yet, we should enshrine it in our multitasking, cell-centric culture. Call it a Townes timeout.As Townes told me during an interview in the mid-1990s at his longtime UC Berkeley office, the story was simply this: He and his colleagues had been stymied in their maser quest until a possible solution crystalized in Townes' mind rather unexpectedly one day in 1951. He was in Washington, D.C., away from his 10th-floor lab at Columbia University, to chair a conference about such problems as how to create something like a maser, which could have a variety of useful applications. The affable scientist got up early in the morning, before the day's meeting, and effectively allowed his mind to wander as he himself wandered the short distance from his hotel over to Franklin Square. It was a fresh spring day, and Townes sat down on a park bench, taking time out to admire the blooming azaleas.As he sat there, allowing his neurons to fire at will, he hit on a critical insight about how to produce an orderly, tightly focused beam of microwaves. That in itself would be a breakthrough, and if they could achieve this feat with microwaves, then they should be able to do it with higher-frequency light waves and produce the now-familiar laser beam.So in many ways the laser was born on that park bench, which is why, especially after the whale picture surfaced, I couldn't help but wonder: What if Dr. Townes, instead of taking that timeout, had taken a phone call, or checked his email, or sent a text, or played Angry Birds? Might we be in the dark about the laser? Maybe or maybe not. And I realize that even if the rest of us take a Townes timeout to allow ourselves some cerebral downtime, we may be unlikely to have Nobel-worthy revelations. Nonetheless, as research and Townes' example suggest, the unpredictable sparks of our own mental machinations should be something we don't want to miss any more than the majestic sight of a passing whale."

Stieglitz intimately photographed his muse throughout their tumultuous, erotically charged marriage. The inspired images are a testament to the power of artistic collaboration and the enduring flame of romance. Together, the power couple defined a uniquely American artistic language. This Valentine's Day, let's celebrate Georgia O'Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz! O'Keeffe, who is best known for her iconic paintings of the American Southwest, met Alfred Stieglitz at his Fifth Avenue art gallery, 291. As a young art student living in New York, O'Keeffe explored the gallery which displayed European Modernists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Stieglitz, the tempestuous king of New York's avant-garde art scene, championed the photographic medium and promoted modern artists. In 1916, while teaching in South Carolina, O'Keeffe mailed a series of experimental charcoal drawings to her friend Anita Pollitzer, who delivered them directly to Stieglitz. Upon unrolling the drawings, an awestruck Stieglitz cried out, ""Finally, a woman on paper!"" Soon after, O'Keeffe and Stieglitz began to exchange heartfelt letters. In May of 1916, Stieglitz would display some of O'Keeffe's charcoals at 291. Finally, in the summer of 1918, Stieglitz convinced O'Keeffe, who was teaching in Texas, to join him in New York City. Swept in from the plains of Texas, a quietly majestic O'Keeffe fixed her intense gaze upon Stieglitz. The photographer had found his muse. As O'Keeffe refined her painterly craft, Stieglitz obsessively photographed her. She was his inspiration; he was her influence. Stieglitz's photographs, which he considered a lifelong portrait, celebrated O'Keeffe as his formidable, yet, inspiring soulmate. The images are mesmerizing; Stieglitz gracefully captures O'Keeffe's hands, the intensity of her stare, and the contours of her body. Whether cloaked in black or boldly nude, O'Keeffe is a majestic model. While pleasing for both artists, the photographs ultimately confined O'Keeffe to the Freudian status of an eroticized female artist. This interpretation, which was encouraged by Stieglitz and the male critics, offended and troubled O'Keeffe. Escaping the milieu of critical New Yorkers, O'Keeffe journeyed to the New Mexican desert for peace and tranquility. While ensconced in the desert, she painted her iconic skulls. After Stieglitz's death, O'Keeffe cultivated a life for herself in New Mexico. She was frequented by artists and photographers who celebrated her uniquely American persona. Ultimately, O'Keeffe's self-promoted New Mexican identity eclipsed the one crafted by Stieglitz. Those remarkable images, however, celebrate the collaborative achievements realized between two determined and talented artists. ""They please me,"" beamed O'Keeffe, referring to her desert skulls in a late life interview. In 2014, admiration for O'Keeffe's work displayed itself in a landmark sale. O'Keeffe's Jimson Weed/White Flower No.1 (1932) sold for $44.4 million at Sotheby's New York, breaking the record for the most expensive art work sold by a female artist. Georgia - Alfred would have been pleased, too!"

In spite of this, his comments set off a storm of criticism from conservative critics who took him to task for both his theology and his politics. While I cannot read their hearts, their rhetoric was so predictable and so harsh, that I suspect some were prompted by a mixture of blind ideology and anti-Muslim animus, coupled with a tinge of racism. More to the point, the President's critics are just plain wrong-- theologically and politically.   What President Obama said was so profound, it bears repeating: ...[We] see faith being twisted and distorted, used as a wedge--or, even worse, sometimes as a weapon...We see ISIL, a brutal, vicious death cult that in the name of religion, carries out unspeakable acts of barbarism...claiming the mantle of religious authority for such actions.  Humanity has been grappling with these questions throughout human history. And lest we get on our high horse and think that this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ...  So this is not unique to one group or one religion. There is a tendency in us, a sinful tendency, that can pervert and distort our faith...  ...we should [therefore] start with some basic humility...Our job is not to ask that God respond to our notion of truth...[And] we have to speak up against those who would misuse His name to justify oppression, or violence, or hatred with that fierce certainty.The President was unwavering in his condemnation of ISIL, while at the same time recognizing that at the root of their evil ideology is the sin of blind certainty, through which this group, and those like it, attempt to validate their actions by, in effect, imposing their will on God. The antidote is humility, coupled with an understanding of our own failings--lest we, too, fall into the trap of arrogant certainty.  Theologically, all of this is quite sound. But latter-day Pharisees were outraged at the President's call for humility and his acknowledgment of the times we have failed to live up to the ideals of our faith.   In response, one Republican leader termed Obama's remarks ""the most offensive I've ever heard a president make in my lifetime...He has offended every believing Christian in the United States...Mr. Obama does not believe in America and the values we all share."" A Southern Baptist leader termed the President's words ""an unfortunate attempt at wrong-headed moral comparison"" suggesting that instead of meddling in theology what the president should do is provide ""a moral framework...and a clear strategy for defeating ISIS"". He continued: ""The evil actions he mentioned were clearly outside the moral parameter of Christianity and were met with overwhelming moral opposition from Christians"".   These criticisms were but a rehash of the GOP's talking points that were used after President Obama's Cairo speech. Then, too, he was accused of creating what his detractors called ""a false moral equivalency between our enemies and us"" and ""insulting America"", with not too subtle reminders that he ""was not like us"".   The President has not been without his defenders, especially those who supported his theological view. But as much as I appreciated his understanding of importance of grounding our faith in humility, the President is not ""theologian in chief"". He is, above all, a political leader whose role is to defend the national interest of the United States. And it is on this basis, and not on theological grounds, that I found the way President Obama framed his remarks to be not only wholly supportable, but vitally important.   The mention of the Crusades and the Inquisition was not an historical ""throwaway line"". Nor was it directed solely at an American audience that feels no responsibility for these ancient actions. Since these events define part of Islam's encounter with Western Christianity, acknowledging them is an important way to begin the discussion with Muslims. Just as in earlier speeches when the president noted other times when we have failed to live up to our ideals--as in our use of torture, or Guantanamo, or the crimes of Abu Ghraib--it is a way of saying to Muslims ""I am hearing you, now listen to me"". This is diplomacy, at its best.  Preaching at Muslims about their failings and countering this with the pretense of our perfection is not a way to begin or have a conversation or to create alliances. If we listen carefully to the discourse taking place in the Muslim world, we learn that they scoff at our claims of ""upholding our values"". They ask, ""exactly which values do you mean"": backing Israel's displacement and oppression of Palestinians; the war on Iraq; the abuses of prisoners; supporting violators of human rights when it serves your ""national interests""?  If we want to have an honest discussion of how we work together to address a common threat--in this case, the danger posed by ISIL--is it not best that we begin by removing the obstacles to that discussion? For those who don't get that simple point, it's called good politics or sound diplomacy.  On the other hand, if we surrender to the President's critics, we can act like the Pharisees arrogantly feigning perfection. We can sit atop the pedestal we build for ourselves damning others, while praising ourselves. We've tried that before and found that when we did we were speaking to no one but ourselves. We may have felt self-validated, but we were very alone in a world our actions had made more dangerous. Follow @AAIUSA for more."
