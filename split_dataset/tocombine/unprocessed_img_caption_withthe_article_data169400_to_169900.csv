It is nearly impossible to avoid, especially during the holidays. When you set foot in any store, scrutinize any shelf or activate any iPad, it's in your face. Red evokes power, energy and enthusiasm. The hue is hallowed! It's undeniably versatile, as you can wear it from day to dinner or weekend to workplace. I dare say that even the little black dress is red this time of year. So call me crazy when I say that I'm just not in the zone -- the red zone that is.As a fashion forecaster, I know that we are in the midst of a color cycle. For the last few seasons, we have been bombarded with a variety of picture-perfect items in the boldest tints. And designers did not stop there -- they offered an amazing amount of visual exuberance with unforgettable flourishes of color blocking, color banding and color clashing. So, it should not surprise me that the holidays would serve up double -- even triple -- doses of its one and only proprietary shade. Crimson, claret, rouge, ruby, russet -- call it what you will, it remains unquestionably red!So what's my problem -- does the color intimidate or overpower me? Does it make me feel self-conscious instead of self confident? After all, color can play with your psyche, change your mood, darken or elevate your spirits. And to most, red is wondrous! Maybe I'm trapped in the stereotype of the fashionista who lives in a closet full of black clothes so that she can always be chic in the city without giving her wardrobe too much thought. I look back on years -- even decades -- of depending on black as a building block and then adding pops of color, exciting jewelry and other eclectic accessories to create interesting looks. My job demands extensive travel, and I can always depend on old favorites in black to guarantee that items in my suitcase work as hard as I do. And the idea of disrupting that formula is way too disturbing for me. Come to think of it, I was just picturing good old St. Nick in a brilliantly tailored black suit and me in bright red lips. It could work!"

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c9b873c0000660009d39b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Actor Sir Ian McKellen, who will appear in the upcoming movie ""The Hobbit,"" has announced that he has been battling prostate cancer for the past ""six or seven years,"" according to news reports. However, he isn't actually being treated for the cancer right now, and is instead employing the ""active surveillance"" approach, the Daily Mirror reported. ""When you have got [cancer] you monitor it and you have to be careful it doesn't spread. But if it is contained in the prostate it’s no big deal,"" McKellen, who is 73, told the Daily Mirror. ""Many, many men die from it but it's one of the cancers that is totally treatable so I have 'waitful watching.' I am examined regularly and it's just contained, it's not spreading. I’ve not had any treatment.""Prostate cancer -- which is cancer that forms in the prostate -- is different from some other cancers because it does not always grow quickly and spread easily. In fact, for some men, prostate cancer can grow slowly and stay in the prostate gland region, causing no serious symptoms or doing any harm to the man when in the early stages, the Mayo Clinic reported. For these men, watchful waiting may be a better option than surgery or cancer treatment; the Mayo Clinic explains what exactly it entails:In watchful waiting, regular follow-up blood tests, rectal exams and possibly biopsies may be performed to monitor progression of your cancer.The New York Times reported that about 10 percent of men diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer will opt for watchful waiting. While research is far from complete on the topic, some studies have suggested that the life-extension benefit of prostate cancer treatment may not be that much more than if you just carefully watched the tumor, Men's Health reported. Specifically, a study from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research scientists showed that over a 20-year period, 2.8 percent of men who chose ""watchful waiting"" would die, compared with 1.6 percent of men who would go under the knife to have their cancer removed. And in another study in the New England Journal of Medicine from University of Minnesota researchers, it was found that the survival rate from prostate cancer was not statistically different between men who had prostate removal surgery and those who just underwent watchful waiting, the New York Times reported.""Men have a strong belief that if they are diagnosed with cancer, they will die from the cancer if it's left untreated, and they believe that treatment will cure them,"" study researcher Dr. Timothy J. Wilt told the Times. ""This study adds to growing evidence that observation can be a wise and preferred treatment option for the vast majority of men. It allows them to live a similar length of life and avoid death from prostate cancer and avoid the harms of treatment."" However, it's important to note that watchful waiting isn't necessarily right for everyone with prostate cancer -- it's important to talk to your doctor to understand the severity of your particular cancer, and whether it's necessary to receive treatment, the Mayo Clinic noted.

It's really not a mystery anymore, thanks to the burgeoning area of sexual selection research. To attract the attention of the females of the species, all you need to do is: Learn to play guitar -- or just pose with one. Simply hand a guy a guitar, and he becomes instantly sexy, according to a recent study by a team of Israeli researchers. A guy who posted a picture of himself with his guitar got almost three times as many positive responses from single women than the same guy without the guitar. Why did it work? Playing a musical instrument may signal that you have the money and leisure time to learn an otherwise useless skill, the researchers posit. Join an improv troupe. Having a ""sense of humor,"" being ""playful,"" and ""fun-loving"" topped the list of traits that women prefer in their mates, says a new study out of Penn State. According to the researchers, lightheartedness signals that a potential mate is unlikely to be a wife beater or commit infanticide. This seems like a stretch to me. Perhaps playfulness signals that you would be good with kids. Playfulness also fuels a variety of other positive traits, including creativity, researchers say.Practice your dance moves. There's a reason so many hook-ups happen in the club. Dancing lays bare otherwise imperceptible genetic glitches in guys, according to research published in Nature. Women also prefer men who show core strength, coordination and flexibility in their dance moves, scientists have found.Get rich -- or just lease a Porsche. When looking to hook-up, women actually respond to conspicuous displays of consumption, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. However, for women seeking a long-term mate, a guy with a Honda Civic was just as attractive as one who had recently bought the Porsche.Interestingly, these findings don't hold true for men. In fact, if a guy says he likes women with a sense of humor, he probably means someone who laughs at his jokes, rather than making jokes of her own, research suggests. So what do guys want? Young hotties. Yes, it seems that, while women want funny guys, guys don't really want funny gals -- they just want women with fresh eggs. Of course, these preferences are gross generalizations and wildly heteronormative. But if I were a guy, I'd definitely play up these traits on my online dating profile. Since I am a woman, however, my only good option is to replace my profile picture with one of Miranda Kerr."
