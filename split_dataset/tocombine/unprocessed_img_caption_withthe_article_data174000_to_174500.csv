Anat Baniel, Founder of the Anat Baniel Method® and NeuroMovem...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brachial-plexus_us_5b9c70d6e4b03a1dcc7ea942,October 21-27 is Brachial Plexus Awareness Week.

My desire is to introduce an approach to working with children who have suffered injury to the brachial plexus that provides breakthrough possibilities. This approach is based in taking advantage of the remarkable capacity of the brain to change itself and ""map"" in the brain the affected arm, despite the injury. These possibilities for gaining full, or almost full, functioning are available through the ""NeuroMovement"" approach of the Anat Baniel Method.The story of Grace, a 13-month-old child who suffered a severe brachial plexus injury to her right arm and hand at birth illustrates these potentials for healing when focusing on the brain.When I first saw Grace at 13 months old, she was obviously a healthy child. At the same time the limitation in her right arm was apparent. She held her right arm close to her body with the elbow bent in a spastic manner. The fingers of the right hand had minimal movement, and the wrist was spastic and rigid. She was able to hold objects by tucking them between her right forearm and chest, and she was able to transfer objects with her left hand into her right hand. Although she was able to stand up holding on, she was unable to crawl due to the fact that she was unable to straighten or lean on her right arm.When a child suffers from spasticity, it is easy to think and feel that something is wrong with her muscles and look to bring about change through manipulation of the joints and the musculature in the affected area(s). Methods that use this approach include range-of-motion and stretching exercises, braces, surgery, and Botox. All these interventions certainly have an impact on the child. However, when we understand that the brain controls all movement and it first needs to map the arm through a wide range of random and eventually voluntary and highly-varied movements, we realize that the only way to bring about maximum recovery -- and oftentimes any real recovery of function at all -- is by performing the intervention in such a way that it will provide meaningful and useful information to the brain. Before beginning our work, Grace received a variety of therapies and daily range-of-motion exercises, with little progress. Her mother was told, in no uncertain terms, that when Grace turned 4, she would need a highly-involved surgery that would hopefully help her to be able to use her arm. As in other approaches, we, too, touch and move the child, but we do not do so in an attempt to directly bring change to a specific joint or muscle group. With the Anat Baniel Method, we use movement and touch as a language, as a way to communicate with the brain of the child. We know that the brain is a highly complex, self-organizing system that, over time, forms and creates patterns that control movement. We look to provide the child with experiences (information) that will allow the brain to recognize the existence of the arm and bring about the desired changes spontaneously.One way in which we provide meaningful information for the child's brain is through the understanding that the body works as a dynamic whole. The arm does not move in isolation, but is a part of the organization of the whole body. When a healthy child lifts her arm to the front and above her head, for example, we can observe movement in the shoulder, the head, the spine, the ribs, the lower back (it arches), the chest (it lifts), the hip joints, the knees, and the feet. The whole body has to organize itself to ensure not only successful lifting of the arm, but also maintaining of balance, orienting in space and maintaining the continuity of movement. In Grace's case, due to the substantial reduction in the communication between her right arm and her brain due to the overall limitation in movement in that arm, her ability to learn to move that arm -- and the rest of her body in relation to it -- was greatly diminished. Only a rudimentary image of that arm could form in her brain. When Grace's arm was lifted and moved about during range-of-motion and stretching exercises, her brain had little recognition of that arm and got little new information to work with; hence there was little progress, and the existing patterns of limitation of her arm got more deeply grooved in.The first time I worked with Grace I had her in her mother's lap, nursing. That provided her with the feeling of safety and gave me easy access to her back. I began by touching her spine and felt that she was able to easily move it to the left in the direction of her fully functioning arm. When I attempted to move the spine to the right, it was rigid. Her head tilted easily to the left since she was able to lean on the left hand, but could not tilt it to the right. Her right knee tilted easily to the left with the right hip lifting as in side-sitting, but her left knee would not tilt to the right, preventing her from falling, as she was unable to lean on the right hand.In other words, Grace's brain had actively organized her whole body to NOT use or rely on her right arm. This understanding provides us with a remarkable opportunity for transformation. Watch the video showing our work with Grace and her progress.Instead of focusing on Grace's paralyzed right arm, I turned my and Grace's brain's attention to the healthy parts of her body that could readily learn to move ""as if"" her right arm was fully functioning. I began very gently moving her spine, ribs, pelvis, legs and head in directions and ways she had never moved them before due to the injury to her right arm. Fifteen minutes into the first lesson, Grace spontaneously lifted and extended her right arm forward at shoulder height. Later that day, at home, without prompting, she continued to move her right arm, lifting, leaning and supporting herself with it. She also began walking from room to room and standing on her own for the first time. By the third lesson, Grace initiated putting a bead necklace over her head using both hands.As the lessons progressed, we continued to use ""Movement with Attention and the Nine Essentials of the Anat Baniel Method."" A year after we began working with Grace, her right hand has become the dominant one, and most of the time it is hard to tell the difference between the two arms, hands, and fingers. Grace's right hand and arm are now an integrated part of her image of self, enabling her to move fully and in ways not previously possible for her.View a follow-up video clip of Grace here.

Disney said Friday, Oct. 19, 2012, that Sofia is ￂﾓmixed-heritage princess in a fairy-tale world."" Her mother is from a Spain-inspired kingdom, and her birth father is from a realm inspired by Scandinavia. (AP Photo/Disney Junior)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c70f61f00002d00213822.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You might have missed the headlines -- there is big news in the princess kingdom:Pocahontas is no longer Native American.Tiana is no longer African-American.Mulan is no longer Asian.At least that must be the case after the debacle over race that Disney finds itself right in the middle of. It is a controversy that touches every family, including mine, as I now face the unenviable and incredibly stupid task of trying to tell my girls I THOUGHT Disney's new princess Sofia was Latina, but I must have been wrong. When she was first introduced days ago, the headlines hailed her arrival: ""Meet Sofia, Disney's First Latina Princess."" But the reports quickly changed: ""Disney's Princess Sofia Not Latin Enough."" And now, the final absurdity: ""Disney: Princess Sofia Isn't Latina.""Sorry girls, Dad was wrong. I know a Disney executive producer was originally quoted online as saying Sofia was Latina. I believed Sofia was Latina. And since you are half Latina, and I am so proud of your mixed heritage, I thought it would be an incredible opportunity for you to have a princess like Sofia. But apparently I was wrong. What's that? Why the confusion? I'll let Disney's Nancy Kanter explain via this gem that she put on Sofia the First's Facebook page for millions of little kids and their parents to decipher:Sofia is a fairytale girl who lives in a fairytale world. All our characters come from fantasy lands and may reflect elements of various cultures and ethnicities but none are meant to specifically represent those real world cultures.Translation: Pocahontas, Mulan, Tiana and any other princess who has been part of Disney's colorful melting pot of characters over the decades must not be who we thought they were. Even fans on Disney's own Facebook page are confused. Jenny wrote, ""Yay, finally a princess with Hispanic roots."" Risa wrote, ""I look forward to watching the first Latina princess with my grandchildren."" The controversy smells of a board room full of people bowing to the pressure of focus groups and research, worried that the color and ethnicity of a princess might affect the bottom line at the cash register. It's wrong.Let me tell you a story: I know a little princess named Alicia Sofia. She is 7. She has a mom who is Latina and a dad who isn't and she and her 4-year-old sister are both already starting to see the color lines in society. So we teach them that people come in all shapes and sizes and shades of skin color. No one is better than anyone else and we can take pride in celebrating everyone's culture. Alicia Sofia already understands race on a level that not many of us ever will. Not too long ago she told us, ""Mommy is brown, Daddy is white and I'm pink."" Maybe we ALL need to view the world through the rainbow glasses of our kids."

AFP PHOTO/VOISHMEL (Photo credit should read VOISHMEL/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6f17240000510094ac4c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I woke up before dawn and hustled to the top deck of the boat. It was the first morning of my four-day, three-night river cruise on the Mekong River in Southern Laos, one of the most laid back places I have ever visited. As the rays of the rising sun filtered through wisps of clouds, I watched a solitary fisherman in a dugout canoe toss his nets and an occasional fish leap in the air. Egrets flew in a wave down the river. Roosters crowed in the distance in an avian version of call and chant. A small outboard motor softly putt-putted across the river. That was all.I had nothing else to do that morning except chill. I wasn't sure what the plan was for the day, but I didn't much care. I could have sat there for days in Mekong meditation, letting the sights, sounds and fragrances of the river wash the internal chatter from my mind. Or just sit on the deck and read my book, look at the scenery and feel the fresh air ripple past my ears. Later, in the heat of the afternoon, I would snooze and drink ice-cold cans of Laotian beer. It is difficult to separate the magic of the Mekong from the magic of Laos, the country through which it flows for much of its meandering route through Southeast Asia. Laos is beautiful, uncrowded and populated by some of the most gracious and gentle people I have ever met. Or maybe it's the river itself, surprisingly peaceful for one so large and significant. Except for the occasional house on stilts and cultivated plots on the shore, there are few signs of development. A ridge of hills as high as 1,500 feet line one side of the river, flat fields line the other. At one point a large golden Buddha on a hill looks down the river valley.  As we glided effortlessly and silently down the wide river, we passed by fishermen in open canoes and hundreds of small islands, mostly clumps of grass, brush, and low trees. Children played in the river along the banks and washed the family water buffalo. Our boat, which was operated by Lernidee Trains and Cruises, the company that hosted my trip, is small, simple, traditional and elegant. There were only eleven guest staterooms, most on the first deck, a dining room and bar on the middle deck, and an open deck on the top for sunbathing, reading, napping, socializing and looking at the scenery. And of course a bar, well stocked with soft drinks, wine and beer. The boat was constructed mostly of richly colored teak, redolent with the fragrances of Southeast Asia. I walked barefoot on the boat for the entire trip, my liberated feet luxuriating in the sensual feel of the polished planks. Every day there were activities to pull me away from my mindless reverie. One day we walked up a long flight of uneven stairs to a Buddhist temple on a bluff overlooking the river. The temple complex was serene and looked untouched by the modern world... except for the satellite dishes. I watched a woman shave the head of a young novice monk.  Another day we visited Wat Phou, Khmer ruins that predate Angkor Wat by several hundred years. The crumbling structures, which were spread over a flat river plain and up the side of a mountain, evoked a very distant time and culture. Just a scattering of tourists was dispersed throughout the site, not enough to break the mood.On our second afternoon, we pulled up to a beach, went for a swim, then had a BBQ dinner on the sand. While we ate and drank, our international group of 15 talked about world affairs, pausing just long enough to listen to the crew sing Laotian folk songs. The last full day took us to the 4,000 Islands area of southern Laos and the Khone Falls on the border with Cambodia. Less dramatic than Niagara, Angel or Victoria, the falls are more like Grade 5 rapids spread across the entire 2-3 mile width of the river. Their significance is more historical than visual. In the 19th century they essentially blocked the French from navigating up the river to get to Southern China and colonize the region. It's interesting to speculate how the world might be different today if they could have penetrated further upstream. Probably better Chinese food in Paris.At the end of the day we rode small, fast boats powered by automobile engines through the 4,000 islands back to our boat. I took advantage of this last chance for the Mekong to work its magic on me as I sprawled across my seat and dozed in the breeze stirred up by the moving boat. I occasionally opened my eyes to look at the scenery, the children playing in the water and the fisherman in their slim boats tossing their nets into the river, before slipping into my meditative state once again, wordlessly absorbing the sensual bounty of this mighty river.(For more information and photos, see Don's blog at www.adventuretransformations.com)"
3,WEDDINGS,What the Wedding Industry Needs to Know About Gay Weddings,"Bernadette Coveney Smith, Contributor

Back then, it was about time. The company was founded in Massachusetts, the first state to legalize same-sex marriage and it was a very big deal. But we changed the name to 14 Stories in 2009 when the laws changed in a few other places. It wasn't about time anymore. Gay weddings were here, and here to stay. But nearly nine years later, the wedding industry is still playing catch-up.If you google ""gay wedding planning"", you'll see a ton of wedding related directories and resources on the first page. You may even find my company. All of those wedding-related directories saw a need for resources that specifically cater to the needs of same-sex couples. That's why I started my gay wedding planning company as well. Keep in mind -- there is an LGBT culture (just as there's a Jewish culture, a Southern culture, etc.) -- and with that culture come unique trends, traditions and experiences.For all of my peers who constantly refer to the bride, stop and think, ""What if there are two brides?"" or ""What if there are no brides?"" And if you answer your phone and are talking to a prospective client, think about how to word your questions so you are not asking about the name of the groom. Keep in mind that the couple may not have family support, may not have a wedding party, may not want the typical wedding traditions. Bottom line -- just don't assume!Because I work closely with wedding industry vendors, in addition to couples, I am asked by vendors for advice on how to do the right thing. Many well-meaning vendors assume the industry is nicely integrated and that same-sex and opposite-sex couples experience the same trials and tribulations during their planning. They assume that same-sex and opposite-sex couples appear side-by-side on wedding blogs, in magazines and in online wedding directories. We don't. And it's not integrated. First of all, the laws in the U.S. don't back us up or protect us. See, we haven't successfully hit integration yet -- and that's one of the reasons for all of those gay wedding directories and resources. But we're getting there. The real weddings of same-sex couples have been in Martha Stewart Weddings, Brides, Destination Weddings and some other magazines. That will help, though the content of the articles and the photos in the ads still remain firmly bride-focused. I'd like to put myself out of business -- but I need the help of those well-meaning vendors, publishers and editors. We all have to do the right thing and stop making assumptions about the gender of the couple. We all have to understand that same-sex couples may bring unique needs and learning about those needs is not just good for society but it's good for business. It's been nearly nine years since the ruling to legalize same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, and when the voters have their say in a few weeks, we may see legal gay weddings in three more states: Maine, Maryland and Washington. The dominoes are starting to fall...let's get the wedding industry to catch up."
4,WELLNESS,New Findings From First CDC Report on Fungal Meningitis Outbreak,"Manoj Jain MD, Contributor
Manoj Jain, MD MPH is an infectious disease physician, a write...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meningitis-outbreak_us_5b9c67e6e4b03a1dcc7e6645,"Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the first comprehensive report on the fungal meningitis outbreak that has killed 12 and sickened 137. There is much news for us.",2012-10-22,"This undated image made available by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the Exserohilum rostratum fungus. The CDC said Thursday, Oct. 11, 2012 tests have shown Exserohilum fungus in 10 people sickened in the current fungal meningitis outbreak. Itￂﾒs a common mold found in soil and on plants. (AP Photo/CDC)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c67e6240000300094a98d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the first comprehensive report on the fungal meningitis outbreak that has killed 12 and sickened 137. There is much news for us. 1. The report's lead author, Dr. Marion Kainer, and her group at the Tennessee Department of Health -- whom I know well -- must be congratulated. They followed up on a single case-report from a clinician and in less than 10 days, along with the CDC, pieced together a number of random meningitis cases, thereby identifying the New England Compounding Center as the source of the outbreak. Without such well-trained epidemiologists based at state health departments, it would have taken us weeks or even months before such a clear picture would have emerged. Why? Because fungal meningitis is not a reportable disease, and often when the spinal fluid cultures are negative, we doctors suspect it may be a virus causing the meningitis.2. The report points out that the presentation of meningitis in these cases is very atypical. Often, in patients with meningitis we see severe headache, fever, and/or photophobia (sensitivity to light), as is often the case with bacterial and viral meningitis. But in these cases, patients only had a mild headache, only one-third have had a fever, and 10 percent have had photophobia -- all of which makes it difficult for the doctor to suspect or diagnose meningitis.3. Another remarkable clinical finding is that nearly 1 in 5 patients presented with stroke-like symptoms. This is again unique to fungal meningitis unlike bacterial or viral meningitis. So clinicians who are seeing patients presenting to the emergency room with a stroke need to obtain a history from the patient to make sure they have not had any spinal steroid injections in the past six months.4. Since the first case was noted to be the Aspergillus fungus, many clinicians assume that it is Aspergillus causing most of the cases of fungal meningitis. However the report notes that half of the initial cases had the fungus Exserohilum species growing in the spinal fluid. Many doctors, including me, were not aware of this fungus. In fact, if such a culture came back positive, without my knowledge of this epidemic I would have likely told the patient that the culture report was false with possibly a laboratory contamination. Yet, undoubtedly this fungus is a pathogen, and it is unclear if there may be other fungal pathogens, which are naturally occurring in plants and soil and which may have contaminated the steroid vials. 5. From the report, we learn that getting the spinal fluid is critical in making the diagnosis. Without the fluid cell count and culture, it is unclear if spinal infection has occurred. As an infectious disease doctor, I know the importance of sampling and culturing body fluid and tissue prior to starting treatment. In these cases, we need to know definitively if there is spinal infection, a local infection or no infection, because it impacts treatment. Unlike bacterial or viral, which have a short course of treatment -- seven to 14 days -- fungal meningitis requires therapy for three to six months, or possibly longer. Moreover, antifungal medicines have many more side effects compared to antibiotics. 6. The report hints at additional concerns. The illnesses from the tainted steroid are not just limited to meningitis. There are also cases of spinal osteomyelitis, bone infection and epidural abscesses, an infection surrounding the spinal cord sac and lumbar disc where the steroid was injected. 7. Interestingly, the list of acknowledgments at the end of the report is as long as the report. And this is important because it reassures me that this is a collaborative effort by extremely well-trained professionals. I recognized many names like Alfred DeMaria, my mentor from Massachusetts Department of Health, and John Jernigan from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We must be thankful for their dedication.While this report reveals much, there is much more to come. We do not know how patients were treated or what their outcome was. Also, we do not know if there are any findings of infections (as determined by an MRI or spinal tap) in patients who have no clinical symptoms. Future reports will surely answer these questions. For now, this tragic event underscores the success of our investment in the public health system.For more by Manoj Jain, M.D., MPH, click here.For more healthy living health news, click here."
