Patterson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6c3ce240000510056dbb9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dan Pompei, National Football Post  With a young team, there will be ups and downs.Taking care of business against RGIII and Russell Wilson. A blowout loss to the Patriots. A tie in San Francisco against the 49ers. An upset loss to the Jets.A run up the stadium steps to the concourse at Candlestick Park. And a run back down.This is life for Jeff Fisher and the 2012 Rams, football’s youngest team. “I haven’t had a team this young in awhile, and it’s fun,” Fisher told me. “You don’t treat rookies like rookies or expect them to act like rookies. You have high expectations and coach them up.”So Fisher, in his 18th year as an NFL head coach and his first year in St. Louis, believes he is in a very good place, despite the roller coaster ride. “We’re having fun and getting better,” he said. “It’s a fun team. They love to play. We had a ball out there in San Francisco. They are fun to coach. There is a good dynamic. Good chemistry. Good personalities. I’m really, really happy with the staff. It’s going to take us some time, but that’s OK. There is no one they don’t think they’re good enough to play against, which is good.”Fisher is excited about the futures of many of his young players. He mentions defensive tackle Michael Brockers, defensive end Robert Quinn, cornerbacks Janoris Jenkins and Trumaine Johnson, running backs Daryl Richardson and Isaiah Pead, kicker Greg Zuerlein and punter Johnny Hekker.And quarterback Sam Bradford still is a young player at 25. “He’s going to be outstanding,” Fisher said. “He’s improved weekly. His accuracy, his deep balls, what he’s doing on the line of scrimmage, his relationship with [offensive coordinator] Brian [Schottenheimer], it’s all coming along. This offense is going to take off in the future with him.”With Fisher’s Rams this year, the big picture is of utmost importance. Fisher talks about big picture experiences like having the team bond in London for a week prior to the Patriots game and building character by coming out of San Fran with a tie.Having Jenkins and receiver Chris Givens run the steps at Candlestick Park after a reported curfew violation also was a big picture move. Fisher said he never has made players run stadium steps before, but he thought it was the right thing to do because he is trying to establish his program.Some coaches might have hesitated to bench a player as valuable as Jenkins, but Fisher didn’t. Not in this situation. “It wasn’t hard, considering the circumstances,” he said. “It’s not hard when you have young players behind them that will get opportunities and step up. Trumaine Johnson played well for Janoris. As you build a team, you want to know that. He played hard, played well. Now you know you have somebody who can come off the bench and play.”Ideally, Fisher, Jenkins and Johnson all benefited from the situation. Fisher knows more about his team. Jenkins knows more about his boundaries. And Johnson knows more about playing in the NFL.Peaks and valleys are part of the terrain for a young team. Fisher is enjoying the ride.Things I Didn’t Used To Know*Defensive player of the year candidate Von Miller has drawn attention for his flashy pass rush and AFC-leading 13 sacks, but Broncos coaches have noticed something else about Miller: he has improved in his run defense and his pass drops. Miller had to learn to play the outside linebacker position after the Broncos drafted him, and he was up and down a little in his rookie season. But he’s concentrated on it and is developing into an all-around player.*One of the secrets to Adrian Peterson’s success this year is the Vikings are using a lead blocker more. They have played bruising fullback Jerome Felton on 35 percent of the snaps. Last year they used a fullback on only 15 percent of the snaps. One front office man pointed to three games in which Felton really helped Peterson. The first was the victory over the 49ers, in which Felton “softened” linebackers Patrick Willis and NaVorro Bowman. The second was the Seahawks game, in which Felton knocked out starting Will linebacker K.J. Wright early in the game. The third against the Lions when his block on Lions safety Erik Coleman sprung Peterson for a fourth quarter, 61-yard touchdown run.My Sunday Best: Quarterback RotationsThe possibility has been raised that the 49ers could play both Colin Kaepernick and Alex Smtih against the Saints Sunday. If Jim Harbaugh goes down that path, he will not be the first head coach to do so. Here are my Sunday best quarterback rotations.Norm Van Brocklin and Bob Waterfield, Rams. This was the best rotation ever. Coach Joe Stydahar finished first in the NFL National Division in 1950 and 1951 by alternating these two players. In 1950, they set an NFL record by averaging 38.8 points per game. It was a rare mix because both were future hall of famers.David Woodley and Don Strock, Dolphins. They were so good together in 1981 they had a nickname: “Woodstrock.” Woodley started 15 games but Strock took 26 percent of the throws. After Woodley was ineffective early in a playoff game against the Chargers, Strock rallied the Dolphins into overtime, but the Dolphins still lost.Roger Staubach and Craig Morton, Cowboys. In 1971, rookie Staubach impressed Tom Landry enough that Landry wanted to play both Staubach and incumbent Morton. Through six weeks, each had three starts. Then in the seventh game, Landry alternated the quarterbacks every play. The next week he names Staubach the permanent starter.Neil O’Donnell/Mike Tomczak and Kordell Stewart, Steelers. This wasn’t a true rotation because Stewart, nicknamed “Slash,” was used more in a utility role between 1995 and ‘96. What the Steelers did was a little like what the Jets are doing now with Mark Sanchez and Tim Tebow.Joe Montana and Steve DeBerg, 49ers. In 1980, the 49ers were a 6-10 team that was transitioning to the Bill Walsh way. DeBerg was the established quarterback and Montana was the rookie. Walsh slowly worked Montana in over the course of the season while phasing out DeBerg.Daryle LaMonica and George Blanda, Raiders. Blanda was the Raiders’ 43-year old kicker and backup quarterback in 1970. When LaMonica was banged up or struggling, Blanda would go in at QB and frequently gave his team a spark. In a five game span, he helped the Raiders win four and tie one.Matt Leinart and Kurt Warner, Cardinals. Leinart was the starter at the beginning of the 2007 season, but when the offense struggled, coach Ken Whisenhunt decided to use Warner situationally, including in the red zone. The arrangement was short-lived because Leinart fractured his collarbone and Warner took over.One Man Yelp: UndefeatedIf you appreciate excellence, or are a Dolphins fan, you will enjoy Mike Freeman’s book Undefeated: Inside the 1972 Miami Dolphins’ Perfect Season. The book examines the ingredients that went into the only perfect season in NFL history as we approach its 40th anniversary.Much of this book is about Don Shula, and how his will transformed the Dolphins from an inept afterthought to a team that would achieve perhaps the single greatest collective accomplishment in the history of sports. But there also is some very interesting background on Mercury Morris, Joe Robbie, Larry Csonka, Jake Scott and others. The book, or at least the best of it, is more about the people who made the season than it is about the actual season.Csonka remembers Shula’s post-game speech after the Dolphins lost to the Cowboys in the 1971 Super Bowl. “…he actually said in the locker room then, ‘We’re going to go one game at a time and win every damn game.’”I wonder what today’s NFLPA leaders would think of this: the Dolphins practiced four times a day in camp, with the first practice at 7 a.m. and the last at 7:30 p.m. Shula made the practices so they became incrementally tougher as the temperature rose during the day. His motivation: to weed out the soft.I’m not sure I buy the author’s contention that this team would have been the best in any era, but I appreciate his passion for the ’72 Dolphins, and you have to give that team full credit for being better that year than any other team has been in any other year.Freeman, who covers the NFL for CBSsports.com weaves in interesting cultural references, tales of drugs, race, entertainment and politics. Freeman did impressive research, and added to it with excellent reporting. His book is well written too, entertaining and breezy. This is a book that belongs in any good football library.Hot Reads*Did you know Ndamukong Suh used to be a kicker?*The next time Mike Shanahan wants to compare RGIII to a movie character, he should come up with someone more contemporary so RGIII understands the reference. Perhaps someone like Shaft or Bullitt or Johny Strabler or… well, nevermind.*As much as the Peyton Manning story has been documented, it’s still underappreciated. My friend Sam Farmer puts it in excellent perspective.*Jeff Tedford may not be good enough for the Cal Bears, but I have a hunch a number of NFL teams will be knocking on his door.*Having Plaxico Burress on the Steelers was genius… a decade ago.Dan Pompei covers pro football for the Chicago Tribune at chicatgotribune.com.

Chief executive George O’Grady couldn’t have asked for anything better than the world and European No. 1 player Rory McIlroy signing off the season by winning the DP World Tour Championship.McIlroy fired a 6-under 66 on Sunday - including five consecutive birdies to close out the tournament - to clear the hard-charging Justin Rose (who shot 10-under 62) by two shots.Luke Donald (71) tied for third with Charl Schwartzel (68). Louis Oosthuizen (69) was another shot back in fifth.Here are 5 Things to take away from Dubai:• • •1. RORY RULES THE ROOST: Amazing to think it has been less than five years since McIlroy turned pro. He always seemed destined for greatness, but there have been other so called “can’t miss” kids who have missed spectacularly.With another major under his belt in this year’s PGA Championship, winning the money list on both sides of the Atlantic, and a stranglehold on the World No. 1 spot, McIlroy seems destined to take the game by the scruff of the neck and not let go for a long time.Perhaps the only impediment to his advancement is the equipment change he will make next year. Many players have switched clubs only to encounter dips in form. However, McIlroy is so talented he could probably switch to plastic kids’ clubs and still dominate.""I just wanted to finish the season the way I thought I deserved to finish the season,"" said McIlroy. ""You know, I played so well throughout the year and I didn't want to just let it tail off sort of timidly. I wanted to come here and finish in style.""• • •2. THERE IS NO RECESSION: Not for Europe’s top players anyway. The announcement of the 2013 European Tour schedule proves that.Following the PGA Tour’s example, the European Tour will feature a “Final Series” of four big-money events worth over $30 million to conclude the season.The BMW Masters, WGC-HSBC Champions, Turkish Open and the DP World Tour Championship will decide who wins the European money list. Players will have to play in at least two of the first three to be eligible for Dubai, while those who play all of the first three will receive a 20 percent bonus on their order of merit points.“The introduction of The Final Series and the associated changes to the structure are being made to bring even more drama and excitement to the conclusion of our season and to further enhance the Race to Dubai,” O’Grady said.“We felt there had to be an additional level of commitment from the membership to these important tournaments, hence the new regulation.“The response from our leading players to this change has been extremely encouraging and we take confidence from their support as we look to continue the positive evolution of the European Tour in an extremely challenging economic climate.”• • •3. GOOD & BAD SCHEDULE NEWS: The good news about the announcement of the 2013 schedule is that there are a minimum of 45 events on next year’s European Tour schedule. The bad news is that there is only one tournament each in Spain and England.The 2013 schedule begins with the Nelson Mandela Championship presented by ISPS Handa from December 6-9, 2012, and carries through several continents before it reaches Dubai in November. With several TBA entries on the schedule, there is the real possibility of further additions. Not bad in the current economic climate.New destinations in Turkey and Bulgaria, the Turkish Open and the Volvo World Match Play Championship at the Thracian Cliffs Golf & Beach Resort in Kavarna, prove that the European Tour continues to break new ground. However, the BMW PGA Championship in May remains the only English tournament on the schedule, while the Spanish Open is the only survivor from seven tournaments on this year’s calendar.Given Europe’s financial woes, the possibility of playing further events in Spain and England remains remote. Just as well former European Tour chief executive Ken Schofield had the foresight to take the Tour outside Europe’s borders back in 1989 with the Dubai Desert Classic.• • •4. LAWRIE'S REVIVAL HIGHLIGHTS SCOTTISH TROUBLES: What a fantastic season for Paul Lawrie, but where are the young Scots to push him on the world stage?The 1999 Open Champion is one of the stories of the year after two wins, making a second Ryder Cup team 13 years after his debut and finishing 10th on the Race to Dubai. He is also 27th on the Official World Golf Ranking.Martin Laird and Richie Ramsay are the other two Scots in the world top 100 at 55th and 56th respectively. Unfortunately, there seems to be a dearth of young Scottish talent coming through the amateur ranks.Scotland placed a lowly 44th in this year’s World Amateur Team Championship in Turkey, finishing behind nations like Guatemala, Puerto Rico and Russia. That is unacceptable considering the investment in Scottish amateur golf over the years.With promising players like James Byrne, David Law and Scott Henry still trying to find their way in the game, Lawrie’s position as top Scot seems fairly safe for now.• • •5. WILL IAN POULTER HAVE PASSPORT PROBLEMS? Given how Ian Poulter rubbished America’s national pasttime recently, it wouldn’t be surprising if U.S. border guards decided to check his passport a bit more thoroughly when he arrives “home” in Orlando.The flamboyant Englishman said on the eve of the DP World Championship in Dubai: “I’ve never watched a full game of baseball. I walk out after about five innings. It bores me tearless. You want to sit there for four and a half hours eating hot dogs and a Coke? Come on, really?”Ouch! Not the way you talk about the national game of your adopted country, especially when you come from a land where cricket, England’s national sport, takes five endless days and can finish in a draw."

4,DIVORCE,Do You Dread Your Stepfamily's Transitional Days? 6 Tips To Conquer The Anxiety,"Barbara Goldberg, Contributor

Did you secretly feel as if you don't want them to come?,2012-11-24,Little girl having a temper tantrum with her desperate mother in background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c89992400003100533c4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Only a stepmom would know what I mean when I say the ""transition days."" Right? It is the day that the kids come and the day that they leave. It also includes the anticipation before and after their stay.   Have you ever felt the anxiety of anticipating your step kids' arrival? Did you secretly feel as if you don't want them to come? It's okay. We've all had those feelings. You don't have to be ashamed of it; those feelings are normal.  Why is this normal? It's change.Any change can cause anxiety. Our left brain harbors thoughts of what it has seen as ""normalcy."" It conjures thoughts about step kids hating their step moms and a chaotic household or anxieties about getting the food ready in time and whether the kids will behave. Some step moms believe that they are under the microscope once the step kids arrive. Why? We are afraid of making a mistake. We truly want to do our best for the kids. We want our marriages to work.  Once any version of these thoughts starts to float through your mind, the limbic system is alerted. Our reptilian brain that resides within the limbic system is responsible for our flight or fight response. Now, the anxiety kicks in and the desire to flee surfaces. Our brain believes that there is real danger coming. (Okay, I know that I'm going to get comments from those of you that will tell me that your step kids are really dangerous. Feel free to write!) It all feels very real.  Now, the frustration and the shame set in. Who can you tell that you really want don't want your kids to come? Answer: no one. (Actually, you can tell all of us at The Evil Stepmother Speaks.) You feel like such a bad person. A loser. Who thinks like that?   These feelings are normal and physiological. In most cases, they don't damper our love for our kids. It is our nerves.  What can we do to fix It? Here are six tips to fight the transition depression:  1. Reverse the thought  Use Byron Katie's technique and change your thinking. When you are thinking, ""I really don't want them to come over."" Ask yourself, ""Is this true?"" Then, ask yourself, ""Is this 100% true?"" State to yourself, ""How does this thought affect your behavior?"" ""Who would you be without that thought?"" Reverse the thought. State to yourself the opposite of your initial thought. Reversals may include, ""I can't wait for the kids to come over. My thinking makes me think that I don't want the kids to come over. The kids can't wait to come over."" These exercises may seem silly, but they reprogram your brain.2. Prepare ahead of time  It always helped me to prepare for the weekend. Cooking ahead of time really helped me as meal preparation stressed me out. Depending on if you are a morning or a night person, bake a chicken or make meatballs the day before. Don't forget about your crockpot; it is a lifesaver.  Also, I like to have a general idea of what we are doing over the weekend. If there is an opportunity to plan something fun, do it. It can be simple, like playing games.   3. Change to casual clothes  When you get home from work, take the time to change into comfy clothes. It helps you calm down.4. Buy yourself some time  I need transition time. I just don't do well with change. When I come home from work, I need time to adjust. Usually I transition in about an hour, but it isn't practical to disappear for an hour. So, in addition to changing your clothes, leave a puzzle out on a table. It becomes the family puzzle and you can work on it together whenever the mood hits you. 5. Don't talk, just listen  Silence helps you transition. Avoid the urge to talk or constantly give your opinion. Ask the kids, ""What was the funniest thing that happened to you this week?"" or ""Tell me the hardest school assignment you had."" Just listen to the answers. 6. Anticipate that the kids may be grumpy  The kids bear the brunt of this transition. How would you feel if you had to move every few days or so? As the kids go through this transition, anticipate discipline issues or moodiness. Give the kids space for their own transition time and be flexible. After all, they are probably feeling the same as we are.  Before you know it, your transition time will pass and, once again, you will be joyful that your kids are home with you."

I wish I could tell you my Decembers are filled with roasted chestnuts and cozy fireside chats while my manicured hands cup a glass of Brunello. The reality is, I'm usually shopping! And I'm pretty sure you are, too. If you can't be bothered with hitting a mall and you love a great deal, the Internet is truly your BFF. I don't do Black Friday, but I do love Cyber Monday. But, you can become a hot mess that will rival your Auntie Annie munching mall shoppers if you don't follow a few simple guidelines. There are a hundred things that can get you to hot mess status this month, but shopping doesn't have to be one of them. Yeah, really!What's My Budget? I never used to do this, but when I started it was the smartest shopping move I made since I cut up all my department store credit cards! Whether your limit is $300 or 10k, it doesn't matter. Most of us have a limit. As you're shoping online, it's really easy to plow through the limit without realizing it. When you're physically shopping you're handed a receipt, you put it in your wallet, it's just more real. So, keep a tally next to you and stay on top of it. Nothing sucks more than a January credit card bill you can't pay. You want to start off the new year with a fresh start and a clear mind. Sounds sappy, but it's the truth. Shop with a strategy Most retailers publish the details of their Cyber Monday sales well in advance, so take a little time to map out where and when to get the best deals. You can save the most money if you do your shopping from your laptop. But like most things in life, preparation is key. What do you want to buy? Do you have a gift list? If not, you could end up with two new pairs of boots and a fabulous clutch, but nothing crossed off your holiday list. I know, it happens to me all the time. The ""one for me, one for you"" shopping strategy can get a little pricey is all I'm saying. Compare, compare, compare Always compare prices before buying. You can check any price on Google in five seconds. I also like to do a quick check on eBay. You'd be surprised how much of your gift list is on eBay, brand new and unopened. Narrow your search by selecting a well reviewed seller, free shipping and how long it will take to deliver. I never buy anything online without checking eBay first.Read up on return policies  Check and double-check return policies before buying anything. Especially on big-ticket items, you'll want to make sure you're not making an irreversible commitment. Nowadays, most online retailing can be done with free shipping and returns, just look for it. It's all there. No hassle returns with extended shipping policies are great since nobody wants to be bogged down with returns right after they're unwinding from the holidays. If you don't believe me, hit up Bloomingdale's on December 26th or January 2nd. Passing time on hot and chaotic lines behind people who forgot their receipt is not a fabulous way to spend the day. Ever.There's something very satisfying about finishing 80 percent of your holiday shopping online in one day. You can breathe a little easier and enjoy yourself more at all those cocktail parties knowing you don't have to go sprinting though a mall on Christmas Eve that smells like teriyaki sauce and Yankee candles. You really don't have to.And remember, always buy a little something for yourself. Shopping for others is sweet but we all covet something nobody will remember to buy us. And you avoided the Cinnabon kiosk. Genius!XO CourtneyCheck your local TV listings for more of Celebrity Designer and Gift.com Expert, Courtney Cachet's gift guides, style ideas and tips.

(Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2ddf52400005000972fbd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Thanksgiving dishes were in the dishwasher. It was 11 p.m. and Black Friday was just an hour away. I was standing in front of the Best Buy in Wilton, New York. I had come to witness the sport of shopping.  By the time I showed up, Andrea Barnard had been waiting in line for 26 hours.  In this sport, Andrea, a mother of four from nearby Saratoga Springs, was the night's frontrunner. You might call her MDP -- Most Dedicated Player. Fully prepared, she had managed to cook and serve her family a Thanksgiving meal one day early, on Wednesday afternoon. By 9 p.m. that night, she had set up two tents and arranged the supplies, which included space heaters, DVDs and snacks (""mostly bagels""). She had a ""battery bank,"" a power source to charge cell phones and other electronics. Just two weeks ago, when I had to evacuate my lower Manhattan apartment during Hurricane Sandy, I'd used the same item.  The whole family was there, except for Andrea's husband, a fireman who was working nights, and her eldest son, who at that moment was working the gun counter at Dick's Sporting Goods, across the street.  So what does it feel like to be the first person in line for a Black Friday sale?  ""You're king,"" Andrea says.  At the top of her shopping list was a 40"" Toshiba flat-screen TV ($179.99). She planned to buy four: one for a friend, one for her son's room, one for her mother -- and one for herself. ""Finally, something for me.""By 11:45 p.m. -- 15 minutes before the doors were set to open -- my toes are already feeling numb.  I look at the barriers cordoning off the waiting shoppers. The line is beginning to swell. Nick Miszko, the Best Buy store manager, eyes the crowds, estimating that more than a thousand people were already in line. I look at my iPhone. The temperature is holding at 34 degrees.What about the stories of stampeding and trampling and vengeful shoppers?  ""People [at our store] appreciate control, so they don't get hurt,"" Nick says, as he advises Vince Lavazzo, one of two security guards on duty. For the last 22 years, Vince has been a police officer in Mechanicville, NY. This was his fourth year doing security work on Black Friday. He's a friendly guy, but it's hard to miss the 9mm pistol on his hip.  Do people act differently because you have a gun? I ask him. ""I don't think I'll have to use it,"" he says lightheartedly. ""But I guess it's a deterrent.""  Overhearing our conversation, a man in line named Jay tells me about a Black Friday incident at a nearby Circuit City a few years ago. People trampled each other. It sounds like urban legend. None of that here, Vince says authoritatively.   Just before midnight, Vince allows the first 100 excited people into the store. After about five minutes, 50 more. The store calls this ""sectioning,"" an improvement instituted in the last few years. ""We've also added garbage cans,"" Nick says proudly.  I overhear two men speaking in Chinese in front of an iPad display case in the back of the store. It turns out they're engineers at the nearby microchip plant, which makes components for cell phones and other electronics. They arrived in the U.S. last January. I haven't had much of a chance to speak Chinese since I worked in Beijing a few years ago, so I jump into the conversation. The men say they're here for the discounts, like everyone else. What do you make of the shopping chaos? ""In China, this is normal,"" one of the men, Guo Liang, says.  His coworker, Hongliang Shen, taps on an iPad, and our conversation steers to Apple. ""Most of the profit is earned by the company,"" Hongliang says, as opposed to the workers. ""It doesn't stay in China.""  The men are impressed by the discounts. When I leave them, they're still standing front of the iPad display.  On the way out of the store, I see Vince talking to another security guard through an earpiece.  Planning to buy anything for yourself? I ask. He tells me he only buys his electronics from his cousin, who owns a small store nearby. His recent purchase: a 47"" Bravia flat-screen TV. But he's not one to shop on Black Friday. ""There's nothing worth waiting this long for.""  Now it's 1:45 a.m. Andrea is heading to her car in the parking lot.   She has the four Toshiba TVs she was hoping for -- along with a full shopping cart, including three electric toothbrushes, on sale for $39 each, down from $100.  Everyone looks tired. I ask her if this is the best way to spend Thanksgiving.  Andrea is undeterred, indicating that camping at Best Buy was a family affair. ""We had our togetherness,"" she says.  ""I'm happy as hell,"" she adds. ""I could sleep for a day, or I could go to the new sales at 6 a.m."""

I spent it, instead, handing out turkey sandwiches to workers in Walmart. And showing my support for one brave soul who walked off the job in protest against exploitation.   Walmart ""associates"" make an average of just more than $10 an hour. That means that if they manage to get a full 40 hours a week -- and many don't -- they get paid $1,700 a month, before taxes. Somehow, that is supposed to pay for their food, shelter, clothing and medical care, and that of their children. Quite a trick.   In state after state, the largest group of Medicaid recipients is Walmart employees. I'm sure that the same thing is true of food stamp recipients. Each Walmart ""associate"" costs the taxpayers an average of more than $1,000 in public assistance.   How underpaid are Walmart employees? This underpaid: if every one of them got a 30 percent raise, Walmart would still be profitable.   Walmart employees in the United States are not unionized. Walmart has used every trick in the book to prevent its employees from organizing. In 2005, in Canada, Walmart closed a store that had voted to go union. Recently, in Orlando, Walmart fired an employee who had just talked about unionizing. When he came back into the store, many days afterward, to say hello to his former colleagues, they handcuffed him.   It's time to do something about this.   So on Thanksgiving, knowing that Walmart employees were missing dinner with their families, we walked into the local Walmart and handed out dinner to them. We gave them a paper bag that had three things in it: (a) a turkey sandwich, (b) a bag of chips, and (c) a letter explaining their right to organize.   There were two points to this. One was to inform the workers of their rights. And the other was to demonstrate to them, vividly, that they are not alone.   The Walmart manager had the police escort us out of the building. For handing out sandwiches. And for showing Walmart employees that they are not alone.   One brave ""associate,"" who had had enough of this mistreatment, walked out with us. Which is her right, under the law, to protest Walmart's unfair labor practices. In fact, a while back, 200 employees walked out of a Walmart store, all at the same time. That really shook up the bosses.  By the way, she made sure that she finished serving her customer before she left. She's that kind of person. WalMart actually could use a few more like her.   I showed my support. I gave her a hug.   And so it begins. Walmart accounts for more than 10 percent of all of the retail sales in the United States. It is the largest private employer in the world, with more than two million employees. And even though those employees comprise barely 10 percent of its cost of doing business, Walmart exploits them mercilessly. Now Walmart employees are starting to organize, starting to fight back.   Who will win? I don't know. But I do know whose side I'm on. And I know that I'm not alone.   Courage,   Rep. Alan Grayson"

Audience members -- many of whom belong to the guilds that will end up casting votes for Hollywood's top awards, including the Oscars -- also applauded many of the film's big musical numbers, including Anne Hathaway's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and Hugh Jackman's ""Bring Him Home,"" as well as the ensemble cast's ""One Day More."" If other audiences prove half as enthusiastic, Universal Studios could have its first Oscar winner for Best Picture since 2001's ""A Beautiful Mind."" Hooper, whose last film, ""The King's Speech,"" won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay at the 2011 Academy Awards, informed the revved-up crowd that he had just finished ""Les Misérables"" at 2 a.m. on Friday morning, making them the first people to see the completed version. His unorthodox decision to have the actors sing live rather than lip-synch to pre-recorded tracks caused some skepticism early on, but the bet appears to have paid off. During a Q&A session following the screening, Hooper said the approach helped establish intimacy between the actors and the audience -- something he felt was important, given the emotional intensity of the material.Hooper said his very first casting decision was to put Hugh Jackman in the role of Jean Valjean, the ex-prisoner who creates a successful new life for himself under an invented identity. In fact, he said, ""If Hugh Jackman didn't exist, I don't think I would have done the film."" The decision to cast Russell Crowe as Valjean's nemesis, the relentless Inspector Javert, flowed from the first. Referring to Jackman's recurring role in the ""X-Men"" films, Hooper said he asked himself, ""Who's capable of intimidating Wolverine?"" and realized there were only a few actors on the list.Hathaway, a Best Supporting Actress favorite on the strength of the film's trailers alone, acknowledged losing weight to play scenes where her character, Fantine, is ill, but said she wished the media would stop obsessing over her diet and start talking about her co-star Jackman, who lost a full 30 pounds for the opening sequence, where Valjean toils as a prison slave. She also said it was her idea to have her hair actually cut during a scene where her character sells her locks to a wig-maker. And though she was nervous about undergoing such a dramatic makeover in the run-up to her wedding, she said the final result wasn't so bad: ""When I eventually looked at myself in the mirror, I just looked like my gay brother. It was fine."" The film also features strong performances by Eddie Redmayne, Amanda Seyfried and the British actress Samantha Barks, all of whom appeared with Hooper following the screening, as well as by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, who did not.

Would you believe Michael Vick and South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson (who -- you may recall -- shouted ""You lie!"" at President Obama back in September 2009 as our Commander-in-Chief was addressing a joint session of Congress)?Strange but true, folks. During a recent phone interview, Tom Kenny -- the actor / comedian / songwriter who's probably best known for voicing SpongeBob SquarePants -- revealed that it was Vick and Wilson's bad behavior which helped inspire the creation of that new Xmas classic, ""Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas).""""This was back in 2009,"" Tom recalled."" And my songwriting partner Andy Paley and I were knocking around some ideas for a SpongeBob Christmas album. I mean, why should Alvin & the Chipmunks and Charlie Brown have all the fun?""""Anyway, what with Vick being sent away to prison for dogfighting and Wilson being so openly disrespectful of the president, it just felt like civilization was falling down around our ears. That everyone on the planet was now acting like a jerk,"" Kenny continued. ""And I wondered : What would SpongeBob SquarePants -- a character who's so sincere, so earnest -- have to say about this? Especially if people began behaving badly around Christmas?""So Tom put his head together Andy and came up with a holiday-themed comical plea for courtesy. A Martha and the Vandellas / Phil Spector-inspired tune which featured lines like:When others are talking, never interrupt Don't put people down or leave the toilet seat up It's the time for family and holly and turkey Tis the season to be jolly not jerkyBut when Kenny & Paley played their ""Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas)"" demo for Russell Hicks, the Executive Vice President of the Nickelodeon Group ... Hicks thought that this song had far more potential than just being the hit single from some SpongeBob Christmas album. Russell thought that ""Don't Be a Jerk"" was the sort of tune that you could build an entire SpongeBob holiday special around. ""And not just any holiday special,"" Kenny enthused. ""Hicks wanted to do something just like those old school, stop-motion Rankin-Bass holiday specials, 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' and 'Santa Claus is Coming to Town.' Which I watched over and over again when I was a kid growing up in Syracuse.""And given that Screen Novelties had previously done some stop-motion pieces for 2008's The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie as well as the opening titles for the SpongeBob 10th anniversary television special, it only made sense that Nickelodeon would then recruit this L.A.-based animation studio to handle It's a SpongeBob Christmas!""Mark Caballero and Seamus Walsh -- the guys who co-directed this holiday special -- do such amazing work,"" Tom said. ""During the four months that it took Mark, Seamus and their team to hand animate this show, I used to invent excuses to go by Screen Novelties and just watch these guys work. I'd bring my 15-year-old son along, who wants to be an animator someday, just so he could see how labor intensive the process is.""Mind you, to help support and promote It's a SpongeBob Christmas! -- which premiered last night on CBS starting at 9:30 p.m. ET / PT -- Nickelodeon finally agreed to let Kenny and Paley produce a full-blown SpongeBob SquarePants Christmas album.""And we really went all out for this holiday album,"" Tom stated. ""To get just the right sound, we chased down Liberace's old harpist, the guy who played the harmonica for the opening theme of Sanford & Son. We've even got members from the 'Wrecking Crew,' that legendary group of session musicians who played on some of the biggest recordings in history to contribute to the It's a SpongeBob Christmas! album.""And to help spur sales of this seasonal recording (which -- as Kenny put it during our phone interview -- is "" ... is available from Amazon and iTunes as well as any of the other online music retailers where your finer digital albums can be purchased from""), Tom and Andy are actually touring the country right now with their band, SpongeBob & The Hi-Seas. In fact, they'll be appearing at The Mall of America in Bloomington, MN this Saturday. Where -- starting at 1 p.m. CT -- Kenny, Paley and their band will be performing selections from It's a SpongeBob Christmas Album! at The Patio.When I pointed out that Tom and Co. will be performing ""Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas)"" at one of the largest malls in the United States on what is sure to be one of the busiest days of the holiday shopping season, Kenny just laughed and then said:""I guess we'll just have to sing that part of the song about how 'There's a sign above the line that says Express. That means 10 items or less' extra loud and then hope that this message sinks in."""

With 15 national championships and 13 Heisman Trophy winners between them, the Irish and the Trojans have been among the nation's elite sides since they first faced off in 1926. Not surprising given the series' history, the 84th installment in the matchup figures to go a long way toward deciding another national champion. Under head coach Brian Kelly, the Irish arrive in Los Angeles with an unblemished 11-0 record and a berth in the BCS title game on the line. When the 2012 season began, USC was the team with designs on the national championship. But Matt Barkley and the Trojans were waylaid unexpectedly along the way. Having suffered a shoulder injury in a loss to UCLA, Barkley will not even take the field, leaving a redshirt freshman the tall task of facing the stout Irish defense.

It will also mark the first time that an unranked USC team has toppled a top-ranked Notre Dame since 1964.

And for those who believe that the Irish have benefitted from incredible luck as well, Kelly will have no part of that discussion.“I told our team I felt like they were the best team in the country,” Kelly told reporters this week.While the Irish have dodged some bullets this season, most notably in a home overtime thriller against Pittsburgh, they have also taken care of business against their toughest opponents. Of course, no one can forget the goal-line stand in the final minute against Stanford that best captured the sheer will of this team when its backs were against the wall...But the biggest play of the season, in my opinion, was Golson hitting freshman receiver Chris Brown against Oklahoma when Notre Dame needed to respond to a momentum swing by the Sooners.If you remember, after leading most of the game, the Irish gave up their first rushing touchdown of the season to mammoth OU backup quarterback Blake Bell in the fourth quarter. The score tied the game, so Golson returned to the field in a hostile environment on the road against a Top 10 team needing to put together a drive to get the Irish back on top.The redshirt freshman QB proceeded to march the offense down the field and re-take the lead for good. In the grand scheme of things, not only did it continue ND's drive to perfection, but it was the defining moment of Golson's career thus far. And here was the key play on that drive, a play-action pass on 2nd-and-2...Kelly and offensive coordinator Chuck Martin believed in Golson, and they believed in Brown. That 50-yard connection set up a rushing score a few plays later that gave the Irish a lead they would never relinquish. And that resiliency has carried the team to an 11-0 mark heading into the showdown at the Los Angeles Coliseum.Can ND remain perfect after Saturday?Despite the Trojans missing quarterback Matt Barkley, backup Max Wittek is dripping with upside, and some believe he has a stronger arm than former 'SC great Carson Palmer. Wittek even predicted this week that the Trojans were going to win. And keep in mind that USC has won nine of the last 10 meetings, losing only in 2010 when receiver Ronald Johnson dropped a TD pass in the final minutes of a 20-16 ND victory.However, these teams are drastically different from those in years past. Perhaps the biggest difference is in Notre Dame's belief that it can win every time it steps on the field. And that belief was proven true on an October night in Norman, where the entire team grew up before the nation's eyes.Email dave.miller@nationalfootballpost.com or follow me on Twitter at Miller_Dave"

They come to my office, leave messages on my phone, call me on Skype and send emails from all over the country. As a psychotherapist who specializes in working with stepfamilies, I've long ago come to terms with the reality that being involved in a stepfamily can be a complicated and painful affair, especially for stepmothers. Some of them are mothers and some are not. Their words and tone come across as a whisper, a hush. ""I need to confess this to someone,"" they tell me. ""I feel so bad about this, but I don't, um, I really just don't, well, you'll think I'm a crazy person for saying this, but I just really don't love my stepchildren.""These women are surprised and more than relieved when I say, ""Well, why would you? They aren't your children. If I took you to the nearest mall and pointed out a group of kids and told you that you needed to love them, you would think I was the crazy one. It's quite normal that you don't love your stepchildren. Just because you fell in love with their father doesn't mean you will automatically love his children."" They thought they were the only ones.For those who aren't involved in stepfamilies, these confessions may seem blasphemous. We are a culture that seems hell bent on happy endings. ""The Brady Bunch"" continues to, without rationale or reason, serve as the template for modern stepfamily life. The expectation for a ""blended"" family is automatic.The reality is that second marriages with children have a 65-70% divorce rate. My clinical practice has taught me that much of this failure derives from the unrealistic expectations so many couples bring to stepfamily life. Many stepmoms feel ""thrown under the bus"" when it comes to their partner's children and that the kids are prioritized over them. Their stepchildren treat them with disrespect and their partner's continual refusal to correct their children or teach basic good manners does not bode well for the marriage. Many men naturally feel protective of their children and have strong desires that their new partner love their children ""as their own."" But let's be honest. It's tough enough for parents to always have feelings of love for their own children, especially when they are in the throes of teenagehood. Imagine how difficult it would be to love someone you are not related to, especially if they treat you with contempt or indifferenceIn the best of situations, it can take a minimum of four years for stepkids and stepparents to feel comfortable with one another. Children will almost always prefer their biological parent (even if they have been abandoned by them or they are deceased), yet many fathers insist that the women they marry love his children unconditionally. Ridiculous. What is a requirement in the stepfamily system is that that all members of the family treat one another in kind and respectful ways. Stepmothers can treat their stepkids in loving ways but it doesn't mean that they have to ""feel"" the love. Nor should they feel guilty for not feeling something as profound and intimate as ""love.""Many divorced fathers feel responsible for their children's pain and may unconsciously desire that their new spouse be a combination of Mother Teresa and Mary Poppins. However, stepmothers cannot be expected to be the first-aid love doctors or step-martyrs for the stepfamily and they cannot be responsible for cleaning up the mess left by the first marriage.Many stepkids do not like or love their stepparents, despite their parent's strong desire that they do so. I single out stepmothers because the research and clinical experience shows that stepmothers are often the dogs that get kicked. ""Only about 20% of adult stepkids feel close to their stepmoms"", according to the groundbreaking work of Mavis Hetherington involving 1,400 families of divorce. The good news is that stepfamilies can enjoy peaceful and respectful home environments. Marriages can flourish. The couple can realize that modeling a healthy marriage is an excellent way to be an excellent parent.WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR STEPKIDS:1. Know that it's normal to not automatically love your stepkids. Remember that in only a minority of stepfamilies does love, after six to eight years in the new family, come naturally.2. Let go of whether or not your stepchildren like you or not. One of the most powerful lessons any human being can learn is to let go of how others feel about them.3. Practice basic good manners and compassion. Act and treat your stepchildren in loving and respectful ways. Remember that the transitions between two homes, the loyalty binds they have for their parents and the loss of their parents being together adds up to a lot of grief, often unacknowledged. 4. Set boundaries with your partner. Let them know it is unacceptable for you to be treated with disrespect in your own home. Insist on Basic Etiquette 101 in your home. Work on creating House Rules and present them to the children as a team.5. Fathers, let go of your fantasies about creating one big happy family. Unrealistic expectations lead to premeditated resentments.6. Focus on your marriage. Be honest. You are with your partner despite the fact that he has children, not because of it. Have date night and nurture the relationship daily. The children in your home have already experienced divorce at least once. Try to prevent it from happening again in their lives and yours."

Brannon suggests reminding yourself why you're shopping,2012-11-23,"A shopper passes by a 50% off sign displayed in a J.C. Penney Co. Inc. store at the King of Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, U.S., on Friday, Nov. 25, 2011. Black Friday, traditionally the biggest U.S. shopping day of the year, got off to its earliest start ever as retailers tried to woo shoppers with discounts and early store openings.

For many people, the thrill of the hunt is motivation enough to endure overcrowded parking lots, 4 a.m. lines and crushing amounts of people. But for others, it seems ludicrous that people would willingly wake up at an ungodly hour to wade through crowds and snatch up items that may only continue to go down in price as the holidays draw nearer.So why do we do it? What is it in our brains that makes the positive outweigh the negative when we decide it's worth it to venture out for Black Friday?People love getting a deal, and they focus on that part -- not the discomfort, says Laura Brannon, a professor of psychology at Kansas State University. ""Part of it is that people get caught up in the arousal and excitement of the event, and that keeps them from thinking clearly about the other consequences"" like the wait, Brannon tells HuffPost. ""Also, once they've committed to going (before they've actually even experienced the discomfort and inconvenience), they start to rationalize their negative experience"" by convincing themselves with inner dialogue like ""It's not that bad,"" or ""I've already waited this long.""Brannon notes that two general principles often drive our desire to wait in unbearably long lines for sales. The first, called the scarcity principle, involves us thinking that we need to get our paws on something that is rare, can run out at any moment, or is hard to get. ""People truly want to get a good deal, and so they might be less rational … when they can look in the environment and find different cues that make them think they're getting a good deal,"" Kenneth Manning, a marketing professor at Colorado State University, told LiveScience. ""The decision-making can be somewhat emotional.""The second principle is called the social proof principle, and it involves us thinking that if other people are also waiting in line for something, it must be good. And while Brannon acknowledged that some stores do offer good deals on Black Friday, people more often get ""caught up in their own excitement, and that's what drives them more than the actual deals themselves."" So how can we avoid getting swept away in the Black Friday frenzy? Brannon suggests reminding yourself why you're shopping in the first place, and to remember that the pressure to ""buy now, or else"" is really just imposed by clever marketers. ""People should remember that their excitement is partly caused by the scarcity of the opportunity and what other people are doing (rather than just the quality of the opportunity itself), so they should not let that stress affect them too much,"" Brannon says. ""Marketers have created the situation. Maybe focusing on the spirit of the season (giving and being thankful for whatever we have) would help people keep things in perspective."" And for people who just must buy that item-of-the-moment, Brannon suggests reminding them that pleasure that comes from buying and receiving is very short-lived.""Most people have probably had the experience of really wanting something for a long time, and then, before they know it, they're bored with it or take it for granted. Kids do this very quickly, but it happens for adults as well,"" she says. Instead, she suggested focusing more on sharing experiences with people, or putting a lot of thought into choosing the perfect gift, instead of feeling the pressure to just buy the latest and greatest.""Research really does show that there's something to the idea of 'it's the thought that counts,'"" Brannon says. ""The idea that someone cared enough to do something for us lasts a lot longer, usually, than the good feelings of receiving the particular gift.""  "
