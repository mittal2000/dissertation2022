It's Mom, Patti, Nurse Joy and me. We're directed to the third floor, which I don't remember going to on previous visits. The person at reception there doesn't seem to know about us; nevertheless, I tell her why we're there and we sign in and sit in the waiting area. Soon this lady, whose name-tag says ""Bev,"" comes over and greets Patti, and smiles are exchanged. She's very helpful -- I sense that she is a patient relations person -- and sure enough we find out that we've been sent to the wrong place, but she arranges for Patti to be registered here anyway. She chats with Patti, who can't speak but is fully aware and smiles brightly. ""How old are you?"" she asks Patti. Mom says, ""Guess!"" Bev says, ""Twenty-Four?"" Mom laughs and says, ""She's 50!"" ""Wow, you look so young!"" I ask, ""Where are you from?"" but am pretty sure I know the answer already. ""Oh c'mon,"" she says. ""Can't you tell?"" ""New York?"" I ask. ""Of course!"" ""What part?"" ""Forest Hills, Queens."" ""I used to go to the U.S. Open when it was in Forest Hills at the West Side Tennis Club!"" I say. Bev says, ""I lived right near there. I have quite a history as a competitive tennis player myself, you know."" We have a good tennis conversation. She tells me of her early mentor, Gardnar Mulloy, former top-ranked U.S. player in the early 1950s. I remember his name from when I was immersed in tennis as a teenager. Mom mentions my installation of Kindsight pieces that have been hanging near the hospital cafeteria for a few years now. ""I LOVE those pieces, I stop and read them all the time!"" I ask Bev if we can make a picture of her. ""Why, you're not going to put my picture there are you?"" ""Maybe, I don't know, why?"" She allows me to photograph her but is a bit reluctant. We make a couple of pictures by the wall, then I go in and help finish registering Patti. After a minute there's a tap on my shoulder and it's Bev. ""Hey, maybe it would be good to put my story up!"" She goes on to tell me about recognition she's received for her achievements in patient relations. We make a few more pictures on the seats but then she has to leave. And I realize that even though we were directed to the wrong place, in many ways, here, as in all of life, what seems wrong is really right.info@kindsightfoundation.orgwww.robertzuckerman.com"

New standards will be set for in-store signage and images will show children of both genders playing with the same toys. The change comes in response to a campaign from the group ""Let Toys Be Toys"" asking retailers ""to stop limiting children's imaginations and interests by promoting some toys as only suitable for girls, and others only for boys."" “We’re delighted to be working so closely with a major toy retailer and believe that there is much common ground here,"" Megan Perryman, a Let Toys Be Toys campaigner, said in a press release. ""Even in 2013, boys and girls are still growing up being told that certain toys are ‘for’ them, while others are not. This is not only confusing but extremely limiting, as it strongly shapes their ideas about who they are and who they can go on to become. We look forward to seeing Toys 'R' Us lead the way to a more inclusive future for boys and girls.""Toys ""R"" Us has attempted to put aside stereotypes in the past. In 2012, the U.S.-based company's Swedish branch gained attention when images in its Christmas catalog challenged traditional gender roles. According to the Let Toys Be Toys release, other U.K. retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Boots, The Entertainer and TJ Maxx have agreed to remove ""boy"" and ""girl"" signs from their stores in response to the campaign.These stores join others in the U.K. that have already made efforts to end gender separation in toy departments. Last summer, Harrods unveiled a massive new toy department organized by theme instead of gender. Before that, Hamleys replaced its pink and blue signage with red and white. On this side of the pond, A Mighty Girl, a site that collects books, toys, movies, and music that empowers young girls, has started a Change.org petition to get Toys ""R"" Us stores here to jump on the bandwagon. ""By following their examples, Toys ""R"" Us in the USA can send an important message to children, parents, and others that children's interests should not be limited by their gender,"" the petition reads. And, GoldieBlox founder Debra Sterling has another plan to crush gender stereotypes at Toys ""R"" Us. In July, Sterling launched a campaign -- and an incredible video to go with it -- to get parents and kids to invade local stores and take pictures of girls playing with her building blocks. ""The odds are against us,"" Sterling wrote on YouTube."" We've been told that GoldieBlox can't survive in mass stores next to Barbie. Convention says that engineering toys for girls are a 'niche' for the affluent, and for the Internet. Together, we must prove convention wrong."""

In their October issue, the magazine that employs Pippa prints an exclusive excerpt of Katie Nicholl's biography of the duchess. Nicholl paints a portrait of domesticity inside the Middleton grandparents' Bucklebury home:Nicholl reports that at the Middletons', the couple had their own wing, comprising a double en suite bedroom and private living room, while another bedroom had been converted into a nursery. The setup meant William and Kate could enjoy complete privacy as well as round-the-clock help from Carole and Michael.The portrait that Nicholl's biography paints matches baby George's official portrait closely. The little prince's parents insisted on taking his photo in a more relaxed style than those of his predecessors. In fact, the portrait itself was snapped by Grandpa Michael Middleton, in the family's Bucklebury backyard.Surprised? Apparently, a healthy, connected family life was part of the deal when the Middletons merged with the royals. Vanity Fair quotes family friend George Brown: ""It was a condition when they got married that they [Carole and Michael] would be a part of the grandchildren's lives."" And Nicholl confirms that, as rumored, the royal couple didn't want hired help to interfere with their child-rearing -- according to a friend, ""William said he didn't want a nanny or nurse coming in and doing shifts. They were agreed on that. They wanted to do the early days themselves.""Nicholl writes that George slept in a Moses basket right beside Will and Kate's bed. As for Kate's post-baby diet? All we know is that ""each morning, Carole whipped up nourishing fruit smoothies and healthy meals while Kate also snacked on her favorite muesli bars."" Sounds far healthier than some of the other post-birth regimes celebrities have cooked up.For more scoop, read the full article at Vanity Fair.George is too adorable for words:Want more?
