Alex Classen, a clinical research nurse at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, didn't want the facility's young patients, who couldn't go outside and play, to miss out on the winter fun -- especially with all the snow Winter Storm Jonas brought in earlier this month. So she had an idea. Since the patients couldn't go out into the snow, Classen filled up a basin with fluffy stuff the weekend of the storm and brought it right to them. ""They can see all the snow falling from the outside and they were really excited about it,"" the nurse told The Huffington Post. ""But it's not the same for them -- to be able to experience it. So I thought, 'Let's give this a try and bring it in to them so they can touch and feel it."" The nurse explained that many of the kids have a type of immunodeficiency and are at the facility undergoing bone marrow transplants. The immunodeficiency puts them at risk for infection, and while they're undergoing transplants, they're even more fragile so they're unable to go out or be around many people. She also added that there are kids from all over the world at the facility and some of them have never seen snow in their lifetimes. Classen didn't want them to miss out. So the nurse not only filled up a basin with snow to bring to the patients, she made several trips outside so all the kids would have fresh snow to play with. The patients made snowballs, colored the snow with magic markers and made snowmen. One child even hit Classen with a snowball, making for a very eventful snow day.The gesture delighted the kids. ""The nurses are incredibly compassionate and caring. They really look out for the kids and the parents, and it feels like a community,"" Jan Wiese, mother of 7-year-old patient Lucy, told CBS News. ""Lucy has been at NIH for almost eight weeks and has barely been able to leave her room, so it was so much fun for her to be able to play with the snow.""Also on HuffPost: "

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) face off on Monday night in the Iowa caucuses.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Monday's Iowa caucuses won't enshrine any presidential nominees quite yet -- just ask former victors Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee and Tom Harkin.But the results will affect how the candidates are perceived by the rest of the nation, which is increasingly starting to tune into the race.On the Democratic side, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that a Bernie Sanders win would be considered a major milestone for him, but not a significant failure for Hillary Clinton. Sanders, who currently trails Clinton by about 3 points in HuffPost's polling average, would likely need record turnout to win.A 52 percent majority of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say that Sanders winning in Iowa would be a sign that he's a serious challenger to win the Democratic nomination, while just 37 percent say it would be a temporary victory for his campaign.""There’s no better evidence that you can win than having won,"" Democratic pollster Mark Mellman told Vox.Just 30 percent say that Clinton losing would be a sign that her campaign is in serious trouble, while 57 percent say it would be only a temporary setback. That, however, reflects a considerably higher perception of vulnerability than in 2007, when just 14 percent of Democrats told Gallup that Clinton losing in Iowa would be a sign of serious trouble.On the Republican side, 66 percent of GOP and GOP-leaning voters say that a Trump win in Iowa would be a sign that he's a serious challenger, while only about a quarter would call it a temporary victory.Regardless of the results, a majority of voters in both parties -- 52 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners, and 51 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners -- think that early states like Iowa and New Hampshire have too much influence on who wins the party nominations for president.Republican voters, though, say by a 12-point margin that in terms of representing the country, Iowa is a good place to begin selecting the next president, while Democratic voters say by a 14-point margin that it's a bad place to do so.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 25-27 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.

Here’s what to watch and what the polls show. We also take a look at where New Hampshire stands eight days before the primary. And Republican party activists nationwide seem to have warmed to the idea of Donald Trump. This is HuffPollster for Monday, February 1, 2016.HERE’S WHAT TO WATCH IN IOWA - HuffPollster: “Both the Democratic and Republican races are close contests in Iowa, and pollsters say surprises are likely. So although businessman Donald Trump has opened up a lead on the GOP side and Hillary Clinton still narrowly leads on the Democratic side, there’s a lot of room for change going into Monday night’s caucuses. Unlike primaries, in which voters simply cast a ballot, caucuses are essentially community meetings. Their outcomes, polling shows, depend on turnout, persuadable voters and late momentum shifts.” [HuffPost] Polls show leads for Clinton and Trump - More from HuffPollster: “The final Iowa pre-caucus poll from the highly regarded Bloomberg/Des Moines Register/Selzer poll finds businessman Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leading in their parties' contests. In the Republican caucus, Trump leads Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, 28 percent to 23 percent. In the Democratic caucus, Clinton leads Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), 45 percent to 42 percent.” Recent polls from NBC/WSJ/Marist and Monmouth University show very similar results, as does Quinnipiac on the Republican side. Quinnipiac has Sanders up by 3 percentage points on the Democratic side. The HuffPost Pollster averages show a 7-point lead for Trump and a 4-point lead for Clinton. [HuffPost, Marist, Monmouth, Quinnipiac]Persuadable voters? - If caucusgoers do shift their preferences on Monday night, Cruz and Rubio could finish higher than the polls indicate. The DMR/Bloomberg/Selzer poll shows that 17 percent of Republicans have Cruz as their second choice, and 1 in 5 would choose Rubio second. The poll also reports that while 55 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers have made up their minds, 45 percent could be persuaded. On the Democratic side, Clinton is the second choice for 26 percent of Democrats and Sanders is second for 28 percent. A big unknown is where Martin O’Malley’s supporters will go in the caucuses where he fails to reach the 15 percent threshold. [DMR/Bloomberg/Selzer, Bloomberg] Watch live election results tonight on HuffPost. RELIGIOSITY, NOT RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION GUIDES VOTE CHOICE IN IOWA - Anne Pluta: ""Marco Rubio’s plan for the final days before the Iowa caucuses, according to The Washington Post, is to talk about God … a lot. And with all the focus on the evangelical Christian vote in Iowa — they make up nearly 60 percent of Republican caucus-goers and are credited with powering Ted Cruz into the top tier of the race — Rubio’s plan isn’t surprising. But the media’s focus on evangelical Christians misses the larger story: The best predictor of vote choice, according to work by political scientists Robert Putnam of Harvard and David Campbell of Notre Dame, is religiosity, not religious affiliation; Putnam and Campbell call it the 'God gap.' Religiosity, as the two describe it, includes the three B’s: belonging, behaving and believing. The stronger a person’s sense of belonging, the more frequent her church attendance and prayer, and the stronger her belief, the greater her religiosity is."" [538]REPUBLICAN ACTIVISTS NOW SAY DONALD TRUMP IS THEIR BEST SHOT TO WIN - HuffPollster: ""The most politically active members of the Republican Party have warmed to Donald Trump’s bid for the party’s presidential nomination since last summer, according to a new Huffington Post/YouGov poll, which finds 68 percent now think he could win the general election. While most surveys attempt to reflect the entire electorate, this one is the latest in a trio of polls focusing solely on Republican activists: well-informed party stalwarts who've run for or held office, served as party officials, worked on campaigns or volunteered their time before elections.Their views shouldn't be seen as representative of the horserace as a whole, but they provide some insight into the role of GOP political leaders in an election cycle where public opinions have repeatedly flouted the establishment. With days until the Iowa caucus and only a scattered handful of endorsements coming from elected officials in Washington, there are increasing signs that the Republican establishment is losing its grip on its activist base."" [HuffPost]Explaining Trump's rise to success - Kirby Goidel and Keith Gaddie: ""It is unclear if Donald Trump has rewritten the rules of political campaigning but he has unquestionably left pundits and political scientists baffled by his success. Most careful observers of politics (present authors included) believed Trump would have washed out quickly and decisively. His seemingly off-the-cuff banter and Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog, vitriol sprayed - rather than carefully targeted -- at political opponents, fellow partisans, and journalists portended a half-life as a presidential candidate that might rival Herman Cain's 2012 presidential run. Yet, time and again, Trump has turned what would have been fatal gaffes if uttered by any other candidate into rally points for voters tired of political correctness and ready for a candidate to speak abrasively if not truthfully….Despite our bafflement, there are lessons to be learned in Trump's success. Perhaps surprisingly, many of them confirm rather than challenge what we know about campaigns and elections."" [HuffPost]TRUMP AND SANDERS LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT WATCH THIS WEEK - The latest polls in New Hampshire show Donald Trump is maintaining a 20-point lead over Cruz, Rubio and Ohio Gov. Kasich, who are vying for second place. According to the HuffPost Pollster average, Kasich and Cruz are tied with 12 percent, with Rubio slightly behind at just over 10 percent. On the Democratic side, the new polls give Sanders a more than 20-point advantage over Clinton. The HuffPost Pollster average, reflecting previous surveys that show a closer race, gives Sanders a slightly smaller 17-point lead. [CNN, Franklin Pierce, UMass Lowell/7NEWS, HuffPost Republicans, HuffPost Democrats]  Watch for changes after Iowa - With only eight days between Monday’s Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire vote, it’s highly likely that what happens in Iowa will affect the standings in New Hampshire. WINNING ISN'T ALL THAT MATTERS - Jonathan Bernstein: “Candidates seek to beat expectations, and the press and the parties judge the results against what they thought would happen. In fact, beating expectations can matter even more than the raw results because it affects the amount and tone of the coverage candidates get….A classic example: In 1984, Gary Hart was perceived to have 'won' Iowa with 16 percent -- no one expected him to finish that strongly -- and Walter Mondale was thought to have 'lost' with 49 percent, because he failed to reach 50 percent. Hart then received so much positive publicity that he pulled a major upset in the New Hampshire primary and went on to become a serious competitor for the nomination.” [Bloomberg View]Does winning in Iowa and New Hampshire predict the nominee? - Jennifer N. Victor: “If Trump and Sanders win Iowa and New Hampshire, 2016 may be like what Democrats experienced in 2000 and 2004, and we may see these candidates as the nominees. But that outcome is far from certain and still seems unlikely in the face of the enormous institutional obstacles they face in their own parties. It's historically unusual to observe the scenario where a candidate wins Iowa and New Hampshire but does not secure the nomination; it's therefore astonishing that we may see exactly this in both of the major parties this year....If Trump becomes the Republican nominee, it's likely to upset an already tumultuous party.” [Vox] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56afa5031800002d0080b03a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This artist's charitable project is her delectable way of thanking her mother for being the peanut butter to her jelly. Jessica Olah, a 30-year-old artist who lives in Brooklyn, New York, spent five days making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as part of an art installation at community bodega Specials on C. The 30-year-old made 2,340 -- approximately the number that her mother, Elizabeth, made for her while she was growing up -- to show appreciation for mom's relentless devotion to her. Not only was the project a super sweet ode to Olah's mother, she also donated the sandwiches to The Bowery Mission, a nonprofit organization that helps the homeless. Olah, who joked that her hand hurts after her big project, told The Huffington Post that she was inspired to start the project after a conversation about old school lunches with a coworker. ""What got me started thinking about how my mom actually made me lunch every single day to bring to school,"" the artist said. ""I was blown away by her dedication in doing that ... I wanted to recognize that as something that often goes overlooked.""So Olah calculated the number of sandwiches her mother would've made her over the course of 13 school years and then made it her mission to make that many for people in need. With the help of donations from an Indiegogo campaign, as well as contributions from various generous people and a large donation of peanut butter from nut butter company Once Again, the artist made her vision a reality.The 30-year-old began her installation last Wednesday. She told HuffPost that the event was made even more special because she hung up photos from her mother, a photographer, featuring a step-by-step process of making a PB&J sandwich. People were able to admire Elizabeth's photos and interact with Olah as she assembled the hundreds of sandwiches. Food was dropped off to Bowery Mission twice a day. Olah's parents flew in from California and stayed with her for an entire day at the installation, handing her ingredients. Though the artist says she probably won't attempt this giant sandwich-making process again, she hopes that we can all take time to show appreciation for the little things our mothers have done for us. ""Part of this was recognizing, beyond my mom, what mothers in general do as a sacrifice or things that go unnoticed and just bringing that attention,"" she said.Also on HuffPost: "

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) didn't give a source for his claim that there are more undocumented immigrants in the U.S. now than there were five years ago.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential hopeful and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio paints himself as the most informed and realistic candidate when it comes to immigration reform. He spent months helping draft a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013, and has spent even longer defending it. So it seems like he should be especially aware of how many undocumented immigrants are in the U.S. -- and the fact that the number has leveled off or even decreased in recent years. Rubio said the opposite Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""""We are worse off today than we were five years ago,"" he told host Chuck Todd. ""We have more illegal immigrants here.""Rubio wasn't pressed on where he got that information. HuffPost contacted two spokesmen for Rubio on Sunday and again Monday to see if the senator had a source for his claim that the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. has risen in recent years, but neither of them replied.What he said doesn't square with most reputable studies. Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated last year that there were 11.3 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. in 2014, and that the ""population has remained essentially stable for five years."" The number peaked in 2007 with 12.2 million undocumented immigrants, according to Pew estimates.  Center for Migration Studies, another think tank, released a report based on Census figures this month estimating there were 10.9 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. as of 2014 -- the smallest the population has been since 2003. The number has been on the decline since 2008, according to the Center for Migration Studies.""The facts of the report tell a different story than what you might hear on the campaign trail or in the halls of Congress, where many send a message that we’re being overrun by undocumented immigrants,"" Kevin Appleby, the center’s senior director of international migration policy, said of the report, according to The Washington Post. ""The facts and the data show that’s just not true. Hopefully, political discourse will be more fact-based going forward.""There is no exact count of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., leading some people to dismiss the idea that the figure can be estimated at all. But a number of experts have done so using data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. And they are largely consistent across different organizations: The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration numbers, has estimated there were between 11 and 12 million undocumented immigrants in the country as of 2012. In its most recent report, the Department of Homeland Security similarly estimated 11.4 million undocumented immigrants for 2012.Rubio has been saying for years that there are 11 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. -- he used that figure in 2013, the year the Senate passed its comprehensive reform bill, and has cited it during the current campaign.Other Republicans have also said the undocumented population is larger than it is, although with more specifics. Front-runner Donald Trump said last year that there were more than 30 million people living in the U.S. without authorization -- a claim for which Politifact found no basis, other than statements from conservative columnist Ann Coulter.

11,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Battles Ghosts Of 2008 On Eve Of Iowa Caucuses,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-iowa_us_56aeb37be4b0010e80ea96f4,Will voters back her this time around?,2016-02-01,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks on Sunday at a campaign event at Abraham Lincoln High School in Des Moines, Iowa. She's projected confidence heading into Monday caucuses.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56af6c4e1f00007f00217090.jpeg?ops=crop_69_808_3931_1859%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa -- What is it with Hillary Clinton and the Hawkeye State?Eight years after her disappointing third-place finish in Iowa, Clinton again finds herself locked in a close race with a popular senator who is winning over the hearts of Democrats on the eve of the state’s caucuses. And like then-Sen. Barack Obama, who ultimately defeated Clinton during the 2008 Democratic primary, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is proving to be a surprisingly tenacious challenger to Clinton’s long-running presidential aspirations.If Sanders’ surge in Iowa has Clinton and her campaign worried, they haven't shown it -- at least not publicly. But at least some of her supporters acknowledged the race has them on edge.“I hope she does well. I might not have caucused, but since it got really close, I thought I’d better just get out there. I am worried, it’s that close,"" said Herb Folsom, a teacher at Drake University in Des Moines, while waiting to see Clinton at a Sunday evening rally.The former secretary of state has projected an air of confidence in the final stretch to the Iowa caucuses. Her rallies are remarkably well organized and are by design smaller and more intimate in order to bring the candidate down to earth -- sometimes turning away hundreds of people at the door due to safety concerns. Her campaign is quick to tout its ground game operation as being unmatched by that of any other presidential candidate, as well as being in place longer than that of Sanders, her chief rival. And she has the backing of a large segment of the Democratic establishment, including a good chunk of ""superdelegates"" who are crucial to locking up the party’s nomination later this summer.More than anything, Clinton has remained stubbornly on message while on the stump. Long gone are the panicky days before the 2008 caucuses, in which Clinton, shaken by the late surge of Obama, addressed massive crowds with speeches that seemed to change haphazardly from event to event. Also gone is the drama, which spilled out into the open in 2008 when feuding advisers routinely attacked and undermined each other over strategy. This go-around, Clinton has surrounded herself with former Obama hands known for running a tight ship.As she barnstorms the state before Iowans head to caucus on Monday, Clinton has framed her candidacy as one of sensible pragmatism rather than that of radical change -- sometimes underwhelmingly so.""I don’t want to over-promise and under-deliver. I’d rather under-promise and over-deliver,"" she told a crowd of approximately 1,000 people in Council Bluffs, who gathered to see Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea, at a local high school. After the event, Chelsea Clinton stuck around to take photos with supporters for nearly a half hour, another way in which the campaign has strived to add a personal touch to its events.Bringing her speech to a close, Clinton almost seemed to be pleading with the attendees to pick the familiar over the new and untested.""Stick with me. Stick with the experience; I have a plan,"" she said, voice rising over a steady crescendo of applause from the audience.The urgency of the moment was evident in Clinton's speeches on Sunday, wherein she attempted to convince undecided voters that they ought to choose an experienced and compassionate leader already tested by Republican naysayers. She touted the economic record of her husband’s presidency, highlighted President Barack Obama's accomplishments and noted that she's secured endorsements from former Rep. Gabby Giffords and billionaire investor Warren Buffett on the issues of gun control and taxing wealthy interests, respectively. She also noted how she represented the state of New York in the Senate during the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, her early championing of equal pay and women's rights, and how often she's been attacked by the industrialist Koch brothers and GOP strategist Karl Rove.""She definitely dropped so many names today. Way more than I have heard in the past with her,"" said Mary Grudle, a teacher at Lincoln High School in Council Bluffs.The point of all that name-dropping was to create a sharp contrast with Sanders, who, Clinton said, has a ""different view, not a different goal"" in his campaign for the White House.The senator, she added, ""wants to have contentious debate"" on successes Democrats already notched during the Obama presidency, like health care. Clinton argued that rather than starting over on health care with a proposal like single payer, Democrats ought to ""protect [Obamacare], preserve it, and make it better.""The 74-year-old senator and his populist message, however, have clearly resonated in Iowa. According to a highly respected Iowa poll released by the Des Moines Register on Saturday, Sanders trails Clinton by just three points, 45 percent to 42 percent, among likely caucus-goers. More troubling for Clinton, the poll showed her trailing badly among voters under 45, a data point made accutely evident by the crowds who turn up at Clinton’s campaign rallies. In contrast, Sanders seems to be highly popular with college students, thousands of whom turned up at his rallies in the final weeks before the caucuses.Clinton supporters who spoke with The Huffington Post at a pair of rallies on Saturday and Sunday seemed resigned to the fact that young people liked Sanders more than their preferred candidate. They agreed that the senator had good ideas, and said that they admired his passion. But they argued that young people backing Sanders were making a naive choice, one that would prove disastrous if he won the nomination. ""I think he appeals on the issues,"" said Alan Lewis, a resident of Council Bluffs. ""I think in a perfect world, you have a Congress who goes along with all his ideas, it would make sense. But just from a practical standpoint, I don’t think that he would be able to do the things that he says that he wants to do.""Dianne Mears, a retiree who lives in Cedar Rapids, took issue with Sanders' education plan. She said young people liked the prospect of a free education, but that they were unaware of the costs associated with such a proposal.""What they’re not looking at is that he’s going to tax the middle class, and they think that he’s going to give free education, but you can’t,"" she said. ""I have kids that go to the university, and they’re into him, but he wants to give it free. It’s not going to happen. It’s not going to happen.""Cornelia Schmidt, another attendee at Clinton's rally in Cedar Rapids, admitted that Sanders pulled at her heartstrings. But, she argued, the senator is ""a little bit too liberal for the other part of America that's old enough to vote.""In an interview on Sunday, Sanders claimed his coalition was made up of more than just young people. He also argued that voter turnout would be the biggest determining factor in whether he comes out on top on Monday.""I think we have a real shot to win this, if there is a large voter turnout. And it’s not just young people. It is working-class people, it is middle-class people who are sick and tired of status-quo politics,"" he said.At Clinton's final pre-caucus rally on Sunday night in Des Moines, excitement was high as the candidate rallied with her husband, daughter and former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin. Clinton again asked attendees to caucus for her -- finally giving her the victory in a state that has shunned her in the past.One supporter in the crowd, however, didn't quite feel the same urgency.“I’m not worried. I think either Hillary or Bernie would be wonderful presidents,"" said Charles Richards, a resident of Des Moines. ""However the caucus comes out, the candidates are going to go on to many other primaries and other caucuses, and it’s a long ways from here to November. It’s a long road. I want Hillary to win. She’s my candidate. I’m for Hillary.”Samantha Jo-Roth contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost:"

Fourteen percent of government workers in a new Government Business Council/GovExec.com survey said they would ""definitely"" consider leaving their jobs if the GOP front-runner wins. Another 11 percent said they would ""maybe"" do so. Democrats, not surprisingly, were significantly more likely to say they would leave.Many Republicans would like to see a smaller federal government, so these survey results might not be that upsetting to them. Trump has said he would be interested in eliminating the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency if he becomes president.""I may cut Department of Education,"" he said in October. ""I believe Common Core is a very bad thing. . ... Environmental Protection, what they do is a disgrace. Every week they come out with new regulations.""But the departures under President Trump could leave a vacuum at the top of the federal workforce, according to GovExec, since a majority of the poll's respondents were in senior positions. Fifty-nine percent of respondents also said they'd feel ""embarrassed"" if they worked under Trump. Forty-nine percent said the same about Democrat Hillary Clinton.The poll was sent to a random sample of Government Executive print and online subscribers from Jan. 20-26, and 688 federal employees in more than 30 civilian and defense agencies completed the survey. Thirty-five percent of the participants identified as independents, 28 percent as Democrats and 26 percent as Republicans.The federal government has already had trouble attracting top talent in recent years with federal budget cuts, furloughs, stagnant salaries and constant bashing from politicians directed at the people who work there.Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"
15,POLITICS,Michigan's Top Lawyer Just Picked A Side In Flint Water Case,Dana Liebelson and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michigan-attorney-general-flint-lawsuit_us_56afcaf0e4b057d7d7c7cfe9,Hint: It's not the low-ranking state bureaucrats.,2016-02-01,"When it comes to a lawsuit over Flint's water crisis, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette has said he cannot defend Gov. Rick Snyder (R) in court and also defend lower-ranking state bureaucrats.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56afcd271f00005000217180.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Residents of Flint, Michigan, allege that state and city officials ignored evidence the city was pumping toxic water from the Flint River into their homes. Bill Schuette, Michigan's Republican attorney general, hasn't finished his investigation into whether any state laws were broken when Flint’s water was poisoned. But in the legal fight, Schuette is already picking sides: On Friday, he said in a court filing that his office probably can't ethically defend Gov. Rick Snyder (R) in court while defending certain lower-level state officials -- and those lower-ranking bureaucrats will need their own lawyers.Schuette, who is widely believed to have ambitions of running for governor in 2018, said that because there is a potential conflict between current and former employees for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the governor and the state, “it is likely [counsel] cannot effectively represent both sets of clients.” The attorney general is asking for additional time so that MDEQ defendants can get their own attorneys. ""We’re going to work with the governor’s office to make sure these folks have lawyers,” a Schuette spokeswoman told the Detroit Free Press. Schuette’s office did not respond to provide additional comment on why he feels there is a conflict. A spokeswoman for MDEQ declined to comment. Schuette has launched an investigation into what, if any, state laws were broken when Flint's citizens were exposed to dangerously high levels of lead in their drinking water. He initially said that reviews by other agencies and pending federal court actions made such an investigation unnecessary, but on Jan. 15 he said he was changing course. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality has taken much of the blame for the Flint water crisis. When Flint switched from Detroit's water system to the Flint River in April 2014, the agency misinterpreted federal law and directed Flint not to treat the new water to reduce its corrosiveness, a failure that ultimately resulted in lead leaching from Flint's aging pipes. Snyder accepted the resignations of the agency's director and chief spokesman after an investigatory task force he'd appointed singled out the agency in a letter.""We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality,"" the task force said in the December letter. ""Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels contributed to creating and prolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan.""Lead is a deadly neurotoxin that can cause a range of health problems, most notably permanent brain damage in young children. After Flint's water switch, researchers showed last fall the percentage of Flint kids with high blood levels increased from 2.4 to 4.9 percent. In October, Flint switched back to Detroit's water system, which pulls from Lake Huron.That Schuette is defending the state and conducting an independent investigation is not an unusual role for an attorney general. Schuette’s office did not previously comment on whether he is having different lawyers within their office handle defense and prosecution. To ensure independence, he appointed a former Wayne County assistant prosecutor -- who has donated to Snyder, as to well as some Democratic candidates -- to lead the investigation. Schuette’s critics have raised questions about how he can fairly represent both sides, and they say that his latest move does not mitigate a potential conflict as far as the people of Flint are concerned. “I think this is a political decision on who to throw under the bus,” said Deborah LaBelle, an attorney for the plaintiffs suing Michigan.

Harrell’s job was to feed discarded computer monitors and televisions to the Angel-Devil, a truck-sized shredding machine that chopped up cathode ray tubes and ground the glass from the screens into powder. He earned $10 per hour for his labor.After his eight-hour shift, clad in the same skully hat and street clothes he typically wore throughout each day, he would greet his family, waiting in a car outside. His infant daughter Jeriyah was especially eager to be held and hugged, he recalled recently. He didn’t know that those cuddles were poisoning his baby.The glass of the cathode ray tubes that Harrell disassembled every day for almost a year contained a huge quantity of lead -- a potent toxin that, if inhaled or ingested, can damage developing brains and organs, and harm adults’ reproductive and renal systems. Even a small dose, if it ends up in a child’s bloodstream, can stunt development and cause lifelong learning problems, doctors say. Each time Harrell’s children would touch his hair and hands, or hug him after work, they would inadvertently come in contact with the toxic metal, which is difficult to wash off with normal soap. Jeriyah, now 6, takes medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and has a hard time learning and staying focused. Her doctors say her difficulties stem from lead exposure. Her older brother was exposed, too, and both children are now being evaluated for behavioral and attention problems at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, their mother, Danielle Walker, said.“We have shed a few tears,” Harrell said. “I didn’t think that working on this job would put my kids’ health in danger.” Most cases of lead poisoning stem from contaminated water, as is the case in the unfolding crisis in Flint, Michigan, or from old, peeling lead-based paint in aging homes or apartment buildings. But experts warn that the risk from dismantled consumer electronic devices, which often contain lead components, is also grave -- and poorly understood.There are more than 1,400 electronic recycling facilities in the U.S., according to E-Scrap News, an industry publication. Together, they employ an estimated 45,000 people, mostly low-income and recently immigrated workers. In 2011, electronics recycling was a $20 billion industry, according to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. Harrell’s children are the nation’s first reported victims of take-home lead exposure from an e-scrap facility, according to Nick Newman, the director of the lead clinic at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, which treated them. But occupational hazard experts who have evaluated e-recycling plants in several states are convinced that many more children have been exposed to lead, and are consequently at risk, than have been reported.The Cincinnati family’s case is “just the tip of the iceberg,” said Diana Ceballos, an industrial hygienist and a visiting scientist at Harvard University. E-recycling is grueling, labor-intensive work. Each year, workers take apart an estimated 4 million tons of discarded electronics by hand. Under rules set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal regulator responsible for worker safety, e-scrap facilities must provide protective clothing and respirators to their employees. They must also train workers to safely handle lead and other hazardous materials. But enforcement of these rules is lax, said Sarah Westervelt, a policy director with the environmental watchdog group Basel Action Network. Many operators don’t take seriously the risk posed from handling discarded electronics, she said, and as a result they provide little or no training to their workers.Harrell began working at the recycling plant known as the Kenwood Road facility not long after it opened in the spring of 2009. The owner of the plant was 2trg, an Ohio-based company that also operated plants in Kentucky and New York, according to its website.Harrell claims that managers never told him the electronics he would handle contained lead. He said he was never told to wear special protective clothing, or to clean his clothing and body before going home.In November of that year, 2trg invited inspectors from OSHA to review its operations. According to a report issued by the agency, inspectors found a high concentration of lead dust around the Angel-Devil machine, where Harrell worked. The agency recommended that 2trg improve ventilation of the machine and provide respirators, overalls and other protective gear to any workers who interacted with it. Harrell said he wasn’t aware of the visit, and that he was never told he should wear a respirator. A few months later, Harrell’s wife noticed that “something wasn’t right” with their daughter. The 9-month-old girl had frequent fevers. A doctor recommended a blood test, Walker said.The results of that test shocked the young parents. The level of lead in Jeriyah’s blood was almost four times the threshold established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Her older brother’s level was three times that threshold.The Cincinnati Health Department inspected both the family’s apartment and that of their grandmother, where they often visited. There was no evidence of deteriorating lead paint -- the most common source of lead poisoning in children -- in either home. They asked Harrell about his job. When he explained that he dismantled old computers and televisions, the inspectors recommended that he contact OSHA and ask for a workplace inspection.Inspectors from OSHA arrived at the Kenwood Road facility in June 2010. They cited 2trg for 12 “serious violations,” including failing to provide a changing room for workers, failing to provide showers for workers who routinely handled lead components, failing to post warning signs about the dangers of lead and failing to train workers on how to properly use respirators. OSHA found that workers like Harrell were going home dressed in the same clothes they wore all day while handling hazardous materials. The company was fined $12,000. Harrell quit soon after. Tests showed that he had high lead levels in his blood, too. In 2012, two years after that OSHA inspection, the Kenwood Road facility still lacked changing rooms and showers, according to a report issued by inspectors from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a division of the CDC. In 2013, 2trg shuttered the facility. Soon after, E-Waste Systems, based in Cincinnati, bought out the company. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency later found 6,000 boxes of cathode ray tubes in the plant. A contractor hired to clean up the mess found “lead contamination throughout the warehouse,” according to EPA documents. In the last three years, at least nine other companies in eight different states have closed up e-recycling facilities, leaving behind piles of lead-containing cathode ray tube glass, according to E-Scrap News.Carol Weinstein, the former chief executive of 2trg, could not be reached for comment. Doyle Calvi, a former 2trg environmental health and safety manager, said he was not familiar with Harrell’s case. When asked about the 2010 OSHA inspection, he said that workers wore safety suits, respirators and eyeglasses.“That’s the standard stuff that we were told that we needed to wear,"" Calvi said. Regulators have not been able to keep up with the proliferation of e-recycling facilities. In most cases, plants are not inspected until after a complaint comes in. “It’s impossible for OSHA to inspect every business,” said Scott Allen, a spokesman for the agency.Industry experts also say that OSHA’s standards, even if followed consistently, are not enough to fully protect workers. In particular, OSHA's standard for the acceptable level of airborne lead in a facility was established in the 1970s -- and experts say it's far too high. OSHA does not have a standard for settled lead dust, which can be the source of take-home exposure.The agency itself has acknowledged that workers are often exposed to dangerous concentrations of lead and other hazardous chemicals because the existing standards are ""outdated and inadequate."" “We tolerate that workers are exposed to high-level hazards,” said Newman, of the Cincinnati lead clinic.Harrell said he is preparing to sue former managers Weinstein and Calvi, along with E-Waste and the temporary staffing agency that helped him find the job. His attorney, Alan Mensh, said he hopes the suit will cause more workers with exposed children to come forward.Harrell now works for a company that manufactures aircraft parts. If his daughter’s blood lead test hadn’t alerted him to the effects of his job on his children, he never would have thought of quitting, he said.“I don’t think it’s fair that my daughter didn’t have a chance of a regular life,” Harrell said. “This is something she will have to deal with for the rest of her life because of me.”"
21,POLITICS,Plutocrats Not Named Trump Are Paying To Influence The 2016 Race,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-super-pacs-gop-primary_us_56afa16fe4b057d7d7c79fba,"Their money has poured into super PACs, mostly backing GOP candidates.",2016-02-01,Donald Trump doesn't need another plutocrat to back his presidential bid because he already is one.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56afa8301f00005000217118.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Very rich people are playing an outsized role in funding the race for the White House, especially on the Republican side. Newly released figures show that over one-third of all publicly disclosed contributions to support presidential bids in 2015 came from wealthy donors, corporations or labor unions giving $100,000 or more.Those large donations have flowed to the super PACs supporting individual presidential candidates. Eighty percent of all presidential super PAC money last year came from donors giving in at least the six figures, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Super PAC fundraising overall rivals the total amount of money raised by the candidates' own campaigns -- 43 percent of presidential fundraising went to the former groups. (The full-year figure was down slightly from the first half of 2015.)In total, $774 million was raised by the candidates' campaigns and their super PAC allies last year. Campaign committees, which can receive a maximum of $5,400 from a single donor, have pulled in $437 million, while super PACs, which can accept contributions of unlimited size, have raised $336 million.Staggering sums are flowing into electoral efforts despite the fact that a number of the candidates have denounced big money in the race.In the GOP primary, the billionaire donors are essentially battling it out -- and several candidates rely on their beneficence to stay in the race.The campaign committees of just six Republican candidates managed to outraise their super PACs in 2015: real estate mogul Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and former Sen. Rick Santorum (Pa.). But even within that group, Cruz, Paul and Graham (who dropped out of the race in mid-December) hauled in nearly equal amounts for their campaigns and super PACs.Conservative Solutions PAC, which backs Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), raised more than $30 million last year, compared to the Rubio campaign's $29 million haul. Hefty contributions were made by hedge fund billionaires Paul Singer and Ken Griffin and by the senator's longtime patron, Miami car dealer Norman Braman. The six-figure donors to Rubio's super PAC alone have chipped in $28 million -- nearly equal to his entire campaign haul.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich have both staked their campaigns on performing very well in, if not winning, the Feb. 9 primary in New Hampshire. Their super PACs raised more than double their respective campaigns. Super PAC donations from six-figure donors also exceeded the amount raised by each man's campaign.America Leads, the pro-Christie super PAC, has received $4 million from hedge fund investor Steve Cohen and his wife, Alexandra. Cohen's former hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2013.Even though the two super PACs backing Kasich, largely funded by huge contributions from super-wealthy donors, are keeping his campaign on the air in New Hampshire, the candidate has complained about the new unlimited-money system. ""I do not like a system where a handful of billionaires can fund your super PAC,"" Kasich said in January in Iowa.The five super PACs furthering Cruz's presidential hopes have raised a combined $42 million. Seven- and eight-figure donations from billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, private equity trader Toby Neugebauer and fracking billionaire brothers Dan and Farris Wilks power the quartet of Keep the Promise groups, which did not increase their fundraising in the second half of 2015 over the first half. Another super PAC, called Stand for Truth, received $1 million from investor Adam Ross and his wife.Part of Cruz's basic stump speech is to denounce the influence of big money and lobbyists in Washington -- what he calls the ""Washington cartel."" He has also decried ""New York values,"" a phrase that his campaign claims refers to the worship of money and commercialism.Christie, in fact, called out Cruz's ""New York values"" slam by highlighting his financial backers. ""Ted Cruz has no problem with New York values when he's collecting fundraising from New York hedge funds,"" Christie said in January. ""Then New York values are just great -- those people have great values, I'm sure, when they are writing him seven- and eight-figure checks."" The funding of such huge war chests stems from a series of Supreme Court decisions that began in 2007 and culminated in the 2010 Citizens United ruling. Super PACs blossomed after the 5-4 Citizens United decision and a subsequent lower court ruling legalized unlimited corporate, union and individual donations to political groups so long as those groups remained independent from the candidates they supported. The legal definition of independence, it turned out, left enough wiggle room for a practical mind-meld between candidates and the super PACs staffed by their associates. It even failed to bar candidates themselves from directly and indirectly soliciting massive checks for those super PACs.In theory, there were limits on how closely a presidential hopeful could work with a super PAC once he or she was running for office. But former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush began the campaign season with an announcement that he would ""consider the possibility"" of a White House run. Over the next several months, when he was ostensibly only thinking about running, Bush personally raised over $100 million for his Right to Rise USA super PAC -- over 70 percent from six-figure donors. And the FEC did nothing to stop this effort.Since Bush officially announced his campaign in June 2015 and stepped away from personally asking for large donations, his super PAC has had more difficulty with fundraising. Right to Rise USA pulled in just $15 million in the second half of 2015. Most of this money came in one lump sum: C.V. Starr & Co., a financial services firm headed by former AIG CEO Hank Greenberg, contributed $10 million in October. It was the largest single donation to any presidential super PAC in the final six months of the year.The $118 million raised by Bush's super PAC last year is over 370 percent more than the $32 million raised by his actual campaign committee. Right to Rise USA has been burning through its money in the final weeks leading up to Monday's Iowa caucus vote. By the end of January, it had spent at least $78 million, leaving $40 million to help keep Bush's flailing candidacy afloat.Despite all the super PAC support Bush has received, he too is frustrated by money in politics. When asked about the Citizens United decision in January, he said that it ""creates a mess. Believe me, I'm living through it right now.""Trump, who has led in the polls for almost the entirety of 2015, does not have an allied super PAC, but then he himself is a personal manifestation of the power of the super-wealthy. His campaign has been largely funded by money he has loaned it and by small contributions from individuals -- many of whom are purchasing his trendy ""Make America Great Again"" hat.Throughout his often viciously populist campaign, Trump has made a point that he is not beholden to large donors like other candidates are. ""The fact is that whether it's Jeb or Hillary or any of them, they're all controlled by these people, and the people that control them are the special interests, the lobbyists, and the donors,"" Trump said last summer.Among Republicans' campaign committees, it was Carson's that raised the most last year, bringing in $54 million. The former neurosurgeon's support came mostly from small donors, but at great expense: Fundraising costs ate up a large part of the one-time Iowa front-runner's war chest. And in the final three months of 2015, Carson's campaign began spending more than it took in -- much of it on additional fundraising.Cruz raised the second most for his campaign with $47 million. His super PACs pulled in $42 million.The top five GOP fundraisers round out with Bush at $32 million, Rubio at $30 million and Trump at $19 million, although much of that came from his personal funds.The Democratic primary race presents a stark contrast to the Republican contest. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley rely mainly on campaign funds and not the support of super PACs. The three candidates raised a combined $195 million in 2015, just $46 million less than the 17 Republicans who ran in the GOP primary.Clinton raised the most for her campaign with $114 million. Sanders brought in $75 million, with over two-thirds -- $54 million -- coming from donations of less than $200. O'Malley was a distant third with $4.8 million.Of the three, only Clinton saw significant funds raised by super PACs endorsed by her campaign. Priorities USA Action, which had backed President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, pulled in $41 million and Correct the Record, an opposition research super PAC, pulled in $3.4 million. The Clinton campaign has been openly coordinating with Correct the Record.Almost all of the money raised by Priorities USA Action and Correct the Record came from $100,000-plus donors. Priorities USA Action received the second largest donation in the second half of 2015 with a $6 million contribution from billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros. That brought Soros' total 2015 giving to the group to $7 million.Priorities USA Action also took in million-dollar checks from television producer and Israel supporter Haim Saban, philanthropist Laure L. Woods, hedge funder Donald Sussman, former mortgage banker Herbert Sandler and a number of unions including the American Federation of Teachers.Early in her candidacy, Clinton announced that campaign finance reform would be one of the pillars of her presidential bid. She has urged the erasure of the Citizens United ruling and ""its pernicious effects"" by constitutional amendment, congressional legislation or new Supreme Court justices.Sanders has made denunciation of billionaire and corporate influence in politics the central element of his candidacy. The super PAC affiliated with a national nurses union has put money behind his bid. But unlike most of the remaining candidates, the senator does not have an allied super PAC run by close associates raising large sums to advocate for him.""If billionaires are able to buy an election, what kind of government do you think we'll have?"" Sanders asked a crowd in Ames, Iowa, last month. ""You'll have the kind that works for the people who paid to get them elected.""Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

No one has dealt with more haters this year than Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, who, as we all know by now, has received wave after wave of criticism this season, even as his team danced its way to Super Bowl 50. In some minds, the censure that Newton’s seen this year is similar to the kind that Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman faced two seasons back -- the year he controversially claimed to be ""the best corner in the game."" And when asked about the similarity in a radio interview on Friday, Sherman showed his solidarity with Newton, underscoring just how baseless the hate for the QB is.""He hasn't done anything wrong to anyone,"" Sherman told 710 ESPN Seattle’s “Justin and Gee.” ""He hasn't done anything off the field or hurt anyone or committed a crime or done anything. He plays the game like a young kid, like a kid's supposed to play it. This is a game. This isn't life. This isn't government. This isn't military. This isn't anything that's that serious. I think people are taking it out of perspective.""Sherman was referring to the finger-wagging Newton’s received because of his touchdown celebrations. He was called a bad role model because of his dabbing back in November, and the controversy surrounding the dance has only grown since then.""They're saying he's a bad example for kids,"" Sherman said. ""This is a kid's game. Unless he's cursing or putting the middle finger up or pulling his pants down or doing things like that, then I don't get what they're saying.”Per usual, Sherman hit the nail on the head: Far from being a “bad example for kids,” Newton has spent many of his off-field hours this season donating his time and resources to aid the local North Carolina community. Sherman’s comments come in the wake of the Panthers’ 31-24 victory over his own Seahawks two weeks ago. Following the game, Newton threw a Seattle team flag onto the field, drawing the ire of a passionate group of Seahawks fans, one of whom called the act “disrespect[ful]” and the signal caller “classless.”Sherman, however, seems to have shrugged off the incident, choosing to respect Newton for his play on the gridiron and passion for the game rather than trying to find any possible fault in his historic season.“The guy's going out there and playing as hard as he can, living the dream and treating it like that. He's honoring the game in his own way.""Also on HuffPost:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d4bb861d00006e00145433.png?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump's opponents have struggled to find a line of attack that would slow the billionaire businessman ahead of Monday evening's Iowa caucuses. They should take a page out of Bernie Sanders' playbook. It looks like the independent senator from Vermont launched the only criticism of Trump that actually worked. During a GOP primary debate on Nov. 10, Trump was asked whether he's sympathetic to workers protesting for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. In response, he offered his usual thoughts about how the United States doesn't ""win anymore.""""But taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is,"" Trump said. ""People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we cannot do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world.""The next day, Trump repeated the same argument on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" when he was asked how he thinks people can live on the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. This time, the Republican presidential candidate added the crucial word ""are,"" clarifying that he believes wages are currently too high, rather than they would be if the minimum wage were raised.""Our taxes are too high. Our wages are too high. We have to compete with other countries,"" he said.The day after that, Trump apparently sensed that arguing wages ""are too high"" was probably a bad idea, especially given his base among white, working-class voters who are not happy that wages are stagnating. He insisted in a Fox News interview that he never said wages are too high, just that he thought the minimum wage should not increase.Still, damage had been done. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton hit on Trump's wage comments at a campaign rally in Texas on Nov. 17.""In [the GOP's] last debate, their leading candidate, Mr. Trump, said, 'Wages are too high in this country.' Honestly, I do not know who they talk to,"" Clinton said. ""They have a lot of people come to their events, but I don't know whether they're actually talking about what's going on around kitchen tables, like what are the concerns that people have.""But it wasn't until Sanders criticized Trump for the ""wages are too high"" comment in December, on television, that the businessman walked back his comments in earnest. ""Look, many of Trump's supporters are working-class people, and they're angry,"" Sanders said. ""They're angry because they're working longer hours for lower wages, they're angry because their jobs have left this country for China or other low-wage countries. ... This is a guy who does not want to raise the minimum wage. In fact, he has said that he thinks wages in America are too high. But he does want to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top three-tenths of 1 percent."" In response, Trump claimed in a series of tweets that he actually believes wages ""are too low.""Trump's decision to effectively disavow his ""wages are too high"" comment indicates just how powerful Sanders' attack was, since Trump isn't one to retract, even indirectly, anything that comes out of his mouth. This past July, for instance, he argued that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is not a war hero because he was captured in Vietnam. Trump refused to apologize to McCain, despite the outcry that followed. After Sanders' slam, Trump presumably finally grasped just how out-of-touch he sounded with the working-class people who back him. Unlike most of the other Republican candidates, Trump has appealed to voters in swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania by speaking out against cuts to Social Security and opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.Republicans desperate to blunt Trump's popularity haven't tried out the Democrats' criticism on wages. Instead, they've questioned whether he's sufficiently conservative on abortion and same-sex marriage and pointed out that he's said nice things in the past about universal health care and Clinton. They've suggested that he's soft on undocumented immigration and highlighted his awkward comment about his daughter Ivanka and his creepy attacks on Fox News host Megyn Kelly. They've also called Trump a ""jerk.""None of that has worked. Indeed, a focus group conducted by Republican media consultant Frank Luntz in December found that hearing negative information about the candidate only makes Trump supporters like him more. Voters who back Trump say that his unfiltered ""personality"" is more important than his stance on any particular policy. However, working-class voters who back Trump are also very worried about the economy and their families' futures, suggesting that highlighting his weakness on wages could hit home for them.""So even people who are not union members, let me say to you, you have a stake in this,"" Clinton said at an organizing event in Davenport, Iowa, last week. ""You should care about all these Republican efforts. And when you hear Republican candidates say, as they do, that wages are too high in America, they're sure not talking about themselves. They're not talking about working people. They are clinging to a set of beliefs that do not work.""Then again, other Republicans likely won't choose to take on Trump over wages, because it would draw attention to their own resistance to raising the federal minimum wage or having a minimum wage at all.

Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Rush Holt, (D-N.J.) in a 2008 photo.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ad33761a00001001ab1a6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BALTIMORE -- The first words Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) spoke at the Democrats' annual issues conference here addressed the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and the massive unrest that followed. They weren't just about “police brutality,” but also about “joblessness” and a “lack of opportunity.” The irony behind the timing isn’t lost on Cummings. Baltimore has been in dire need of both criminal justice reform and solutions to tackle heroin use for decades. But only in the past year have the two issues been on the lips of numerous politicians -- Republican and Democrats alike. Heroin, Cummings said, has “been in Baltimore ever since I was a child.” He recalled the first time he heard of a heroin overdose in his childhood neighborhood and how incomprehensible it was: “it was like telling me someone had found something on Mars.”During the sessions on justice reform, Cummings relayed to his colleagues conversations with his young constituents: that they were “angry,” concerned about their education and jobs. But the talk with members quickly turned to heroin, he said.“There was a time the drug situation was seen as a black, urban issue and basically the response was 'lock ‘em up, throw away the key -- for years, not months, years,'"" Cummings said. Now, ""the heroin epidemic has invaded all kinds of communities -- particularly New Hampshire, but it’s everywhere.""Over the last few months New Hampshire has used its position as the first-in-the-nation primary state to get 2016 presidential candidates talking about heroin addiction. The addiction crisis has grown over the past two years, but it’s been a problem in cities for decades. The overprescription of opioids, in particular, is credited with driving a growing number of people in the white middle class toward heroin for their addiction.“It bothers me that people did not view it as a health issue before now,"" Cummings said. ""Now we have people basically begging to see it as a health issue because we’re seeing so many overdoses and we are seeing drug addiction invade communities that never even dreamed of it,” he continued. “A lot of these folks are all white people.”Cummings quickly noted that he feels for anyone who has lost a loved one to addiction -- pointing to his loss of a nephew to gun violence just four years ago.“I swear to god, my nephew was like my son,” he said. “But again, the African American community has been begging for years, begging people to look at this as a health issue and you’ve had legislators who want not to appear soft on crime.”Cummings hopes that the new outlook on drugs will help Democrats gather more Republicans to their side. A majority of House Democrats back a bill co-sponsored by Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) and Bobby Scott (D-Va.) -- a sweeping bill that cuts mandatory minimums and invests in prevention, cop training and programs that reduce recidivism. But there are multiple bills floating around the House and Senate, threatening Democrats' chances of seeing their preferred bill through to the end. Overall, Cummings is optimistic, but he doesn’t want to rush the issue if it looks like the two parties can’t agree on a meaty bill. If that doesn’t happen this year, Cummings said, he still believes “significant change” can be achieved through legislation in the next two to three years. “Some of the greatest advocates for change have been people who have experienced pain,” he said. The chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), also sees a window for change.""The heroin epidemic sort of wedged open the door to have a conversation,"" he said.“To often some of our colleagues will think: 'criminal justice, that's not really an issue that I have to worry so much about in my district because it's really inner city, urban,'"" Becerra said. ""But then all the cities start to talk about heroin, and you hear it's.... in some of the places that our Republican colleagues represent. And all of a sudden it's: 'Yeah, we got to do something.'”Becerra views the heroin crisis as the issue that will get his colleagues to the table to talk about criminal justice and beyond -- about crack cocaine and other addictive drugs that he’s seen crush cities like Los Angeles, which he represents.Becerra and his colleagues also understand that the shift in Republicans' thinking reflects its spread to white, rural and middle-class areas -- traditional GOP strongholds. “It’s not lost on many of us that the more enlightened view being taken toward dealing with the heroin epidemic in America may in part relate to the fact that it has devastated suburban communities in ways not previously seen before,” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.)But when Jeffries first entered Congress just four years ago, he didn’t think it would be possible to address mass incarceration and the failed war on drugs, he recalled. “Hopefully in the face of this rise in the heroin epidemic in the inner city and rural America a more enlightened approach will prevail,” Jeffries said. ""Mass incarceration has been a failure, which is linked directly to the war on drugs, which has been improperly prosecuted for decades in this country.""And while the path to reform may be clearing, there are still obstacles in the way. Rep. Scott, the top Democratic co-sponsor on the SAFE Justice Act, has “devoted his life” to the issue of criminal justice reform, in the words of Pelosi. But he's not holding his breath.Scott is worried lawmakers are too eager to pass legislation that is called criminal justice reform but that does little. Asked about a GOP-proposed Senate bill to cut mandatory minimums for non-violent drug offenders, Scott looked skeptical.“The other [bills], it’s hard to say if you’ll have any reduction in incarceration or not,” he said.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced the legislation that Scott is wary of in October, and it cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in a bipartisan 15-5 vote shortly thereafter. The bill, which has a companion measure in the House authored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), does seek to reduce mandatory minimums, reform compassionate release programs and offer those who were sentenced to life in prison for a crime committed when they were under the age of 18 the possibility of parole. But as Human Rights Watch put it, the bill “resembles an accordion -- it shrinks and then expands.”An example of this, the group points out, is that while both Grassley's and Scott’s separate bills would allow judges to set sentences below the 10-year mandatory minimum for drug crimes, Scott’s bill bases eligibility on the offender’s role in the drug-trafficking conspiracy, not on the quantity of drugs. Grassley, a known defender of mandatory minimums, argues that his bill is one that tackles mass incarceration ""while targeting violent criminals and masterminds in the drug trade.""In his own bill, Scott countered, ""you get money for body cameras, prevention, second-chance programs and all that with the reduction of mandatory minimums -- that doesn’t do everything but a there’s a whole lot of reform in there.""On Tuesday, Scott and his Republican counterpart on the bill plan to hear from the Charles Colson Task Force on Federal Corrections, which has urged the U.S. to reduce the number of inmates by 60,000 over the next decade.But Scott and Cummings both fear that something small could pass this year, and Congress will leave the rest of the issue on the table. Cummings hopes that a leader on the Republican side will rise, drawing more to the SAFE Justice Act, which has 57 co-sponsors, including 28 Republicans.“I’m hoping that it’s just not one of things where.... we’ve got to talk about these drugs because that’s what people are talking about,’” he said. “No, no, no, no, no, no -- it simply cannot be a moment surrounding an election. It must be a movement.”"

Clinton, a former secretary of state, is under renewed scrutiny for her use of private email during her time at the State Department.

CNN's Jake Tapper asked Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, about his memorable ""damn emails"" remark in an October debate and whether it meant he didn't think Clinton erred in her use of a private email account.""Nope, nope.
