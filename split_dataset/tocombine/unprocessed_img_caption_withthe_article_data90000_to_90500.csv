In PEN's view, the cartoonists' valor lay ""in their dauntless fortitude patrolling the outer precincts of free speech."" But two weeks earlier, another cartoonist, Garry Trudeau, accepting a George Polk award for his own work as creator of the Doonesbury strip, said that Hebdo's patrol had crossed the border beyond which ""free-expression absolutism becomes childish and unserious"" and is ""its own kind of fanaticism."" ""By punching downward, by attacking a powerless, disenfranchised minority with crude, vulgar drawings closer to graffiti than cartoons,"" Trudeau contended, ""Charlie wandered into the realm of hate speech, which in France is only illegal if it directly incites violence. Well, voila -- the 7 million copies that were published following the killings did exactly that.""Trudeau wasn't excusing the murders of Hebdo staff. He certainly wasn't ""lecturing his murdered peers"" that they'd had it coming, as the conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat claimed in an ideologically obsessive, morally confused column that ended with Douthat himself lecturing the slain cartoonists about ""progressivism's present confidence (even in the face of murder) in its prescribed hierarchies of power and victimhood..."" But when Trudeau noted an undeniably causal connection between the cartoons and the consequences, he revivified a hard truth that Douthat ducked and that PEN overlooked: Courage without merit doesn't always justify the cause or message it claims to be promoting, and the blood that is shed in its struggles -- even its own blood -- doesn't automatically, retroactively sanctify its noble-sounding claims.When Trudeau added that ""Ridiculing the non-privileged is almost never funny -- it's just mean,"" he really got under the skins of conservatives such as Douthat and the former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum, who are becoming frantic in their efforts to blur the meanings of ""privileged"" and ""non-privileged"" in order to justify their increasingly embarrassing defense of inequalities and degradations that are poisoning the whole society and their own movement's base. Sooner or later, they'll have to face this. But as long as they can find feckless liberals to bash, they'll put that off.Frum launched the conservative attack on Trudeau (and, with a characteristically partisan spin, on The Nation and The New Yorker) in his Atlantic blog post by defending Jews. He wrote that ""Garry Trudeau is not the first person to insinuate that France and Europe are guilty of over-concern for the sensibilities of Jews at the expense of the sensibilities of Muslims, .... But Trudeau is the first prominent person identified with the mainstream of American liberalism to advance the point, and that represents a milestone of sorts. But a milestone toward what?""The only milestone here was Frum's own breathtaking insinuation, which he left hanging in his question mark, that Trudeau is as guilty of anti-Semitism as ""the rulers of Iran,"" to whom Frum linked him because Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had sponsored Holocaust-denial conferences including anti-Semitic cartoons. Contrary to Frum's suggestion and, indeed, to his own perverse performance, Trudeau never insinuates. It's not his way of communicating. What he actually does is try to nourish consensus about where to draw red lines of editorial ""good judgment and common sense,"" as he put it, against gratuitous, childish attacks on Muslims or anyone else, including Jews. Conservatives disparage this effort only at the cost of betraying their own commitments to republican ordered liberty and, indeed, only at their own peril.Frum avoids facing this by telling us that Trudeau's solicitude for the non-privileged is ""held by many influential people"" -- by which Frum does not mean the many privileged conservatives like himself, who have ample voice in, and often control of, editorial pages, cable television networks, and radio call-in shows, but he does mean the feckless liberals they have already defeated politically as well as polemically. The reason for this dodge is that if conservatives ever had to acknowledge the breadth of their victory, they'd have no one to blame for its worsening consequences but themselves.So, on they go. Frum is keen to liberate Hebdo cartoonists, and freedom of speech generally, from censorious liberal finger-wagging, and to do so by lowering Trudeau's ""red line"" protecting all minorities. What Trudeau actually did say is that although some anti-Semitic equivalents of Hebdo's anti-Muslim satires are illegal in France, that country's ""tradition of free expression is too full of contradictions to fully embrace."" He observed, incontrovertibly, that when Hebdo had fired one of its columnists for refusing to retract a rabidly anti-Semitic column, ""some red line... was in place for one minority but not another,"" and he urged that Europe's Muslim immigrants be similarly protected by a line drawn not in law or in blood but only in the kind of self-restraint that's essential to public discourse: ""It's not self-censorship, it's emotional intelligence,"" as he put it Meet the Press. ""Freedom should always be discussed within the context of responsibility,"" he said in his Polk speech.The problem is that Frum already has an indication of what his new, gratuitously vulgar and demagogic strategy will yield. That the attack by two gunmen on a Muhammed cartoon drawing contest in Dallas was an outrage doesn't retroactively justify that stupid, gratuitous, Hebdo-like provocation masquerading as ""free speech."" Again, the point isn't that the contest should have been barred legally; it's that, as Trudeau put it, ""Society has to decide collectively what's untouchable"" -- meaning via a consensus that isn't imposed by law or in the name of ""The General Will"" but that emerges and evolves provisionally, through democratic, non-violent give and take, some of it provocative, but none of it gratuitously hate-mongering.Such civic-republican sentiments were long championed by conservatives, from Edmund Burke to Robert Bork, as well as by liberals. Yet in voicing them now, Trudeau has run afoul of a new conservative strategy, one that, especially since the Citizens United ruling, but really ever since Rupert Murdoch's media arrived in America in the late 1970s, has all but abandoned civic decency for a free-speech absolutism reminiscent of the left-wing Berkeley Free Speech Movement of the 1960s.As Theodore B. Olsen, George W. Bush's former solicitor-general, put the new conservative proposition in 2009, ""If dancing nude and burning the flag are protected by the First Amendment, why would it not protect robust speech about the people who are running for office?'' Olsen was speaking then as the lead advocate for Citizens United, the nonprofit corporation that produced Hillary: The Movie to swift-boat then Senator Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign without identifying by name the citizens who would be exercising that kind of free speech by funding and authorizing the movie.In other words: Why not let Charlie Hebdo or Occupy protestors rant all they want, as long as we can do it more loudly and expensively, without having to identify ourselves as individual citizens on a level playing field? The problem here is that freedom of speech means little if one side has megaphones while the other has laryngitis from straining to be heard; ironically and revealingly, the use of megaphones was denied to Occupy protestors in New York's Zuccotti Park and other locations. Do Frum and other conservatives really mean to defend the relentless disparagement and disruption of our always fragile civic understandings by a capitalism that would have appalled Adam Smith and John Locke? Mightn't they pause just a minute to consider that that's exactly what they're doing when they disparage nurturers of a better civic-republican consensus like Trudeau?Alas, Frum's column was far from the only unintentionally hilarious demonstration of privileged and powerful conservatives insisting that they're underdog insurgents against privileged liberal elites. Douthat's Times column excoriates ""a moral theory popular among our intelligentsia, one that The Atlantic's David Frum, in a response to Trudeau, distilled as follows: In any given conflict, first 'identify the bearer of privilege,' then 'hold the privilege-bearer responsible.'""In 830 words, Douthat exhibits an advanced case of Ideological Displacement Syndrome, telling us that ""the western left,"" ""the contemporary left,"" ""today's progressives,"" ""contemporary progressive"" thinking, ""idealistic and progressive-minded figures,"" and ""progressivism's present confidence,"" and ""today's progressivism"" are to blame for crises initiated and exceeded by elements in his own movement that he is relentlessly silent about. It makes you wonder if he's delusional or just lying with a priestly cunning that's analogous in its own way to Frum's insinuations of anti-Semitism. I won't unpack these embarrassments here, other than to note that in his complaint that progressivism's ""prescribed hierarchies of power and victimhood... deny history's true complexity,"" Douthat preaches that, ""Rather than a clear arc, [history] offers what T. S. Eliot called 'many cunning passages' -- in which persecutors and persecuted can trade places, and even the well-meaning can lose their way entirely."" But history also offers D.H. Lawrence's warning that influential people shouldn't stimulate others' ""personal, superficial, temporary desires"" but ""tell us of our own deeper desires."" The powers that conservatives champion have been doing the former, with increasing velocity.Writers like Frum and Douthat dodge this truth in order to distract themselves and the rest of us from having to face what their own movement is doing to its base and, indeed, to themselves. Lord know, feckless liberal elites are easy enough to satirize, but their often-silly, counterproductive reactions are just that -- reactive, not causal, to the devastation that is upon our civil society. Far closer to parody and ripe for satire was the ""Disinvitation Dinner"" that Yale's richly-funded William F. Buckley Program organized to honor the highly privileged and influential conservative columnist George Will, who'd been invited to speak at Scripps College but then had been dis-invited.The pretext for the dinner was that Will had been martyred to privileged liberal censoriousness. A celebratory article about it in The Weekly Standard -- written by Daniel Gelernter, a recent Yale graduate and embittered son of the nearly-martyred conservative writer and Yale Prof. David Gelernter, who'd been maimed by an explosive package sent by the Unibomber -- implied that the Buckley Program was honoring George Will off campus, in Manhattan, because he'd somehow been dis-invited or otherwise barred from Yale.But Will has never been dis-invited by Yale; he spoke there and stayed overnight there in 2013, at the invitation of the Buckley Society itself. Yet the very headline on Gelernter's article implied the opposite: ""College Kicks off 'Disinvitation Dinner' by Hosting Speaker Shunned by University."" What college? What university? Does that matter to ideologues and propagandists with money to burn? The Yale Buckley Program dinner was a black-tie affair in the Hotel Pierre, although Gelernter tactfully left out those details about this black-tie insurgency against privilege. Gelernter's article and Will's own astonishingly churlish, wildly exaggerated remarks are well worth adapting for a satire of such insurgencies. Not only does Frum, who knows better, insist that ""many influential people"" [privileged liberals] hold Trudeau's views; he also tells us that ""many"" people whom Trudeau regards as non-privileged are committing hate crimes against French Jews and others that are convulsing France. ""Many""? Two can plat at that game, David. ""Many"" Jews can be said to be this or that. Is that fair, or even wise? I happen to know something about where Trudeau's much wiser sensibility is coming from. Although I've never actually met him, he and I were undergraduates in Yale's residential Davenport College (as were George W. Bush and the financier Steven Schwarzman) in the late 1960s, when Trudeau began his Doonesbury strip in the Yale Daily News and when Yale President Kingman Brewster, Jr. was saying things like the following to us (as well as to Joe Lieberman, John Kerry, and Howard Dean, all undergraduates during his presidency):""To a remarkable extent this place has detected and rejected those who wear the colors of high purpose falsely,"" Brewster told my own entering class in 1965, possibly with the Berkeley Free Speech Movement on his mind. ""This is done not by administrative edict or official regulation [but] through an ethic of mutual trust and responsibility among students and faculty that lies deep in our origins and traditions.""Before you cast that as a snob's boast about an in-crowd, remember that the civil rights movement was advancing on similar premises at the time. At Yale's 1964 Commencement Brewster had presented an honorary doctorate to Martin Luther King, Jr., then fresh out of jail. ""The presumption of innocence is not just a legal concept,"" Brewster would write later. ""In commonplace terms, it rests on that generosity of spirit which assumes the best, not the worst, of the stranger.""That, too, can't be guaranteed by administrative edict or official regulation. Brewster understood that a liberal capitalist republic has to rely on its citizens to uphold voluntarily a generosity of spirit like this that neither the state nor markets can supply. Therefore, he knew, liberal citizen leaders have to be nurtured and trained all the more subtly and intensively -- not only in elite colleges but in church basements, immigrant settlement houses, and civic and sporting associations of all kinds.Doonesbury conveyed that truth to many of us students not by preaching or declaiming or insinuating but, as in all great cartooning, by nourishing a critical, generous sensibility with unspoken irony and humor, in images conveying social understandings that can't be legislated or propounded. Whether he depicted Brewster bemusedly as ""President King"" or Yale quarterback Brian Dowling (""B.D."") as stoic even when at a loss on the field, Trudeau revivified every day the balance of unspoken affirmations and let-downs that the real Brewster sketched by writing, ""There is no greater challenge than to have someone relying on you; no greater satisfaction than to vindicate his expectation."" Far from assuming the best, not the worst, of the stranger, Hebdo has been an equal-opportunity offender. It has showed no more care than Trudeau's conservative critics have done for the humble, silent majority of strangers, many of them fleeing not Muhammed (whom they cherish), but tyranny, orchestrated hatred, and kleptocracy perpetrated in his name.Privileged conservatives who've made such a great show of defending silent majorities whose members seek only to work hard and play by the rules shouldn't betray them now by defending Hebdo against civic-republican critics like Trudeau by emulating those who would dance nude or burn the American flag or smear Muhammed -- all in order to justify the retaliatory ""speech"" of anonymous, moneyed privilege that is breaking their own followers' rules and hardening their hearts against people whose offenses are at worst complicit in, but not causal to, the devastation that has made America an un-developing country culturally and economically.In another column, I may examine the tragedy in which Frum, Daniel Gelernter, James Kirchick, Eliana Johnson, Jennifer Rubin, Nathaniel Zelinsky, and many other young Jewish neoconservative graduates of a Yale that has forgotten or misrepresented Brewster's example and ethos, and, with it, that of Garry Trudeau, have made a Faustian bargain with funders and forces whose inexorable blame-shifting will make them gulp and run before this decade is done. In the meantime, I'll say only that a neoconservative is an addled, would-be American patriot who has never read Chapter 9, ""War Fever,"" of Amos Elon's The Pity of It All: A History of the Jews in Germany, 1743-1933. Douthat, mercifully free of that syndrome but not of a certain priestly cunning, ended his column on Trudeau by excoriating ""today's progressivism as a force that has consistently liberated adults at the expense of children's basic rights."" But the greatest devastation of families is occurring in red states, where conservatives control politics and schools and progressives have scant influence. This devastation being driven by powerful, privileged entities that are dispossessing and degrading millions of Americans' options and -- please note, Ross -- their dignity: When Calvin Klein ""kiddie porn"" ads depicted pre-pubescent youths in come-hither poses on the sides of public buses in New York City some years ago, no conservative writer noted that it was private investors in free markets who had put them there and that these market-come-ons were removed only thanks to protests from citizens bearing the non-market, civic understandings of the kind that Doonesbury nurtures and that black-tie insurgencies at the Pierre disparage.Correction: This post referred to Nathaniel Zelinsky as Daniel Zelinsky and has been corrected."

The ability of any other ex-politician, when a former president, or congressman, Republican or Democrat, to accumulate such large amount of money in such a short period of time is unmatched.  -- Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Business Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, Peter Schweitzer, May, 2015[Hillary] Clinton offered a message that the collected plutocrats found reassuring... declaring that the banker-bashing so popular within both political parties was unproductive and indeed foolish... ELIZABETH WARREN The industry that gave the most money to Washington over the past few years was... credit [card banks].We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrations in the hands of a few, but we canot have both.  --Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis***  If you're someone who wants to lessen the dominance of concentrated wealth over our political system, end the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington, significantly reduce income inequality and avoid foolish wars, do not be deceived that Hillary Clinton is your ally. Moreover, if the Democrats anoint Hillary as their nominee, there is a significant danger that public disgust at her soft corruption, and lack of trust in the veracity of her campaign pledges, could lead to a Republican becoming the next President.For their entire political careers, the Clintons have been servants of the oligarchy. Since President Clinton left office, they have parlayed the presidency and State Department into tens of millions of dollars in personal wealth, paid for by the oligarchy, which has in turn transformed them from mere servants to full-fledged members of the oligarchy. They have transformed the presidency and the State Department into the biggest revolving door of all between Washington and Wall Street.If the only choice we have for President in 2016 is between a corporate neoliberal like Hillary Clinton and a reactionary corporate Republican who wants to roll back the New Deal and deny minorities, immigrants and gays basic human rights, Clinton is still the less bad choice. If nothing else, the prospect that the next President could get as many as three Supreme Court nominees is reason enough to vote for Hillary Clinton over a right-wing Republican.But, if that's the only choice accorded to American voters, it's a sad commentary on the corrupt, money-dominated, state of American ""democracy.""Both Clinton and the Republican nominee are projected to raise over $2.5 billion in campaign funds directly and through Super Pacs and dark money organizations -- levels of campaign financing that can only come from individuals and corporations with great concentrations of wealth and not from small donors. Whatever the campaign rhetoric, differences in government policy will occur only on the margins. ""Clinton, Inc."" -- the Clinton's interconnected trifecta of political fundraising from wealthy donors, paid speeches for hundreds of thousands of dollars an hour to Wall Street bankers and corporations, and contributions to their foundation from foreign governments and domestic oligarchs to curry favor -- has taken the soft corruption of American politics to a new level of sophistication. It's not illegal bribes (so-called ""quid pro quo"" corruption) that are at the heart of the corruption of American politics by concentrated wealth -- there may be no smoking gun where it can be proven that the Clintons took a campaign contribution, a foundation donation, or a six-figure speaking fee in exchange for an explicit promise at the time to take a specific government action on behalf of the donor. (Although, to be fair, something pretty close to a quid pro quo bribe in the web of Clinton, Inc. fundraising could well be disclosed in the course of the campaign, which could sink her candidacy and guarantee a Republican President. )The heart of the corruption of American politics is what the Supreme Court considers legal -- it's the use of money to buy access and influence policy, which millionaires and billionaires can afford and ordinary citizens cannot. And no one in American history has better perfected a system for selling access and influence than Clinton, Inc.It's not that Republicans are any better. If anything, their ostensibly legal corruption is even more blatant and less subtle than the Clintons'. Think of the ""Adelson Primary"" or the ""Koch Primary"" in which Republicans scurry to court favor with a handful of billionaires in the hopes of receiving hundreds of millions of campaign cash. Would Republicans be so aligned with Netanyahu were Adelson not also one of Netanyahu's biggest political supporters? Would they be such climate change skeptics were it not for the dirty energy business of the Kochs? And what Jeb Bush's manipulation of what remains of campaign finance laws by pretending he's not actually running for President while raising tens of millions in unregulated personal money for Super Pacs run by his closest campaign aids.The soft corruption is bipartisian.And as long as this soft corruption persists, it will be impossible to solve any of the nation's biggest problems.There is no Democrat less able to credibly stand up to this soft corruption than Hillary Clinton, the master of its use. What were the most important laws that Bill Clinton supported and signed as President? Welfare reform, which made poor people poorer; NAFTA, which led to the loss of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs; The Graham-Leach-Biley Act, which repealed the Glass-Steagal Act which for nearly 60 years had barred taxpayer-insured banks from making risky bets in securities; and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which banned the government from regulating derivatives. These Clinton-backed laws, vigorously lobbied for by the financial industry, made lots of bankers lots of money and helped lead to the financial collapse of 2008 and the taxpayer bailout of the too-big-to-fail banks.What were Hillary Clinton's most noteworthy votes as Senator? Voting to authorize George Bush's invasion of Iraq (perhaps the most damaging blunder in the history of American foreign policy); and voting for the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001, which was heavily lobbied for by the banking industry (and strongly opposed by Elizabeth Warren) and which would have made it harder for ordinary people with the misfortune of losing a job or getting sick to discharge their debts in bankruptcy.So when push came to shove, on the important economic issues, Bill and Hillary Clinton were loyal servants of the oligarchy.But that's not all. After leaving the White House and State Department, Bill and Hillary pedaled their influence as a past President and a potential future President into oligarchic personal wealth for themselves personally.The oligarchy, and particularly the banking industry, richly rewarded them, and made a down payment on the future loyalty of a possible President Hillary Clinton with ten of millions of dollars in speaking fees and contributions to the Clinton Foundation which turned the Clintons into multimillionaire members of the oligarchic class themselves.There are two reasons to be concerned about the Democrats nominating Hillary Clinton without a credible challenge from someone (Elizabeth Warren, are you listening?) who is not dominated by the soft corruption of indebtedness to concentrated wealth that Hillary Clinton is. The first is that if elected, Clinton will likely continue the revolving door of Wall Street financiers being the prime economic advisors to both Democratic and Republican Presidents, the interests of the wealthy will continue to come before those of ordinary Americans, and America continue counterproductive military interventions in foreign lands.The second, and even more dangerous reason, is that voter distrust rooted in the Clintons' soft corruption could lead her to lose the Presidency to a right-wing Republican who would be even worse Hillary might not confront the power of the oligarchy. But even a corporate Democrat such as Hillary is likely to try to protect the most important elements of the New Deal and Great Society social safety net like Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance and the (weak but better than nothing) Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank Act, even if she negotiates to weaken them at the margins. If any of the Republican contenders win the presidency, they will lead a full-on charge to dismantle what's left of the social safety net for poor and middle class Americans, seeking to privatize Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher system, and gut even the weak financial regulation of the Dodd-Frank act, and appoint more right-wing justices to the Supreme Court. Such an outcome would be a catastrophe for all but the top one percent.But Hillary Clinton's soft corruption makes it impossible for her to credibly run a campaign focused on the public's disgust at both Washington and Wall Street. Though even more beholden to big money, there's a serious danger that a Marco Rubio or a Scott Walker could run an effective right-wing populist campaign against Hillary Clinton as a corrupt leader of the past. In addition, Rubio or Jeb Bush might be able to shave off enough Hispanic support for Democrats to narrowly win some key swing states.There's too much complacency in the Democratic Party. Too many Democrats just can't wrap their head around the idea that Hillary Clinton could lose to a seeming lightweight like Marco Rubio or Scott Walker or to a third President Bush. But that complacency -- which has led Democrats to concede to the inevitability of Hillary's nomination, is extremely dangerous.In what's likely to be a very close presidential election, the winner will be the candidate who can best mobilize the enthusiasm of his or her supporters to get to the polls. There's no doubt that the Republican base will be highly motivated to take back the White House after eight years of Obama. But there's reason to doubt that a candidate as compromised by big money as Hillary Clinton can turn out the ""Obama coalition"" of young people and minorities in sufficient numbers for Democrats to win a third straight Presidential election (something that has been done by the party in power only twice since World War II).In Obama's wins, African-American voters were 13% of the electorate, while in the eight prior Presidential elections they never made up more than 11% and were as little as 8% when Bill Clinton first won in 1992. A lower black turnout for Hillary could lead to Democrats losing key swing states like Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania. When it comes to young people, Obama won 18-29 year olds by 30% in 2008 and 20% in 2012, while between 19992-2004 Democrats won 18-24 year olds by an average of 11.5% and 25-29 year olds by an average of only 7%. It's hard to imagine young people turning out in the same numbers, or giving Hillary the same margins, in an election that appears to be a nostalgic look back at the '90s when they were hardly born. And are the millennials who were inspired by Obama's message of hope and change -- many of whom are now disillusioned eight years later and saddled with student debt and low-paying jobs -- going to come out for Hillary in the same numbers that they came out for Obama? A fall-off in the youth vote could result in Democratic losses in several key states including Colorado and North Carolina.Moreover, George W. Bush received 44% of the Hispanic vote in 2004 and 35% in 2000, compared to only 27% for Mitt ""self-deportation"" Romney in 2012. If the Republican nominee is Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio and he could increase the Republican Hispanic vote to even the 35% 2000 levels, it could move key states like Florida, Colorado and others into the Republican column.Meanwhile, during the period since Hillary Clinton formally announced her candidacy amidst controversy over her fundraising and email practices, her negatives have dramatically jumped. A May 4 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that in the past 7 weeks, the share of people with a negative view of her jumped from 36% to 42% and only a quarter of registered voters said she is honest and straightforward, down from 38% last summer.With no serious contenders to Hillary's coronation as the Democratic nominee, much less a serious contender without her history of soft corruption, what will Democrats do if a month or two into the primary season next year, more evidence of Clinton corruption has been revealed or she is sinking in the polls?Despite the increasingly populist surge among grassroots Democratic voters, the fact that there are no credible Democratic opponents to Hillary's nomination is a testament to the Clinton money machine's dangerous ability to dominate national Democratic politics.I don't know whether Elizabeth Warren's reluctance to enter the race is due to her personal reluctance to undergo the rigors of a national Presidential campaign, or because she fears being crushed by the Clinton money machine. But if Sen. Warren sincerely believes in the principals about which she speaks so eloquently, as the only progressive Democrat with the stature to credibly challenge Hillary Clinton for the nomination, it's incumbent on her to enter the race. First, there are significant policy differences between the Warren wing and the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party: Warren knows in her bones that it will be impossible to significantly reduce income inequality and improve the life of the middle class and poor without confronting the political power of concentrated wealth. While Clinton may adopt some populist rhetorical flourishes, and take some baby steps to try to help the middle class, her nearly 40 years in public life have been dedicated to cozying up to concentrated wealth and, since 2000, accumulating a goodly share of it for herself. Under a Hillary Clinton Presidency, concentrated wealth will continue to dominate American politics.Second, Hillary's soft corruption, and the distrust she instills in too many voters, could lead to a Democratic defeat. It may seem counterintuitive, but nominating Elizabeth Warren could allow the Democrats to again seize the banner of change and inspire millions of otherwise complacent voters to come to the polls.A Republican Presidential victory in 2016 would be disastrous to the country and disastrous to the middle class and poor. But that could be the sad outcome if no serious Democratic challenger takes on the soft corruption of Clinton, Inc.And if Hillary Clinton is anointed the next Democratic Presidential nominee and manages to defeat any of the prospective Republican nominees, the United States will continue to have great wealth concentration and little meaningful democracy."

With the Caribbean home to over 700 islands, islets and reefs, your hardest choice is going to be choosing which one to make your travel destination. Pack the towels and sunscreen, we're going for a swim!Here are the beaches we love and recommend when traveling with kids.1. Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman IslandOn the charming Cayman Islands, Seven Mile Beach continues to be a hotspot for beach lovers. Take in the mesmerizing beauty of the sparkling blue water hugging the crescent-shaped shore or get a closer look by taking the family snorkeling through the gorgeous barrier reefs. Only a couple miles away is Stingray City, one of the biggest kid-friendly attractions on the island (and for good reason!), where your children can get a close up look and feed Atlantic Southern stingrays. There is Westin Grand Cayman Seven Mile Beach for a great hotel option in the area.2. Grace Bay, Turks & Caicos Grace Bay in Turks & Caicos (Flickr: Matthew Straubmuller)Grace Bay on the Providenciales is a convenient stop for many cruise ships so consider hopping on board a cruise to get to the island. Once on land, you'll be hypnotized by the enthralling natural beauty; sugary white sand and shimmering water that stretches for miles.

The report credits unusually high temperatures, a diminished snowpack and a severe lack of rainfall with drying up the trees, leaving the region susceptible to forest fires.Of the more than 4.2 million acres surveyed in Southern California, researchers found 164,000 acres with high tree mortality. They found approximately 2 million trees had died over the last year.In the southern Sierras, researchers found over 10 million perished trees in 4.1 million acres. There, mortality is ""widespread and severe"" in the foothills among ponderosa, gray pine, blue oak and live oak trees. Jeffrey Moore, the acting aerial survey program manager for the region, told the Los Angeles Times he expects the mass tree mortality to continue throughout the summer.“It is almost certain that millions more trees will die over the course of the upcoming summer as the drought situation continues and becomes ever more long term and as bark beetle populations continue to expand,"" he said. California is in its fourth year of drought, with precipitation levels far below normal across the state. According to the National Drought Mitigation Center, 66.6 percent of the state is currently experiencing severe or exceptional drought. The rainfall deficits have prompted Gov. Jerry Brown (D) to impose the state's first-ever mandatory water cutbacks, calling for reductions of 10 to 35 percent from 2013 usage levels. Violators could face fines up to $10,000.""Today we are standing on dry grass where there should be five feet of snow,"" Brown said in a statement last month.

4,HEALTHY LIVING,Unmasking Mental Illness in Beirut,"Emily O'Dell, ContributorWriter, Better World Advocate, & Assistant Professor at Sultan...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unmasking-mental-illness_b_7094714.html,"Witnessing these four young mental health advocates share the highs and lows of their healing journeys, it was clear to all present that telling one's story openly and honestly is a sign of strength -- not weakness and shame.",2015-05-04,2015-04-28-1430255880-9625612-WA3IMicrophoneSMALL.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-28-1430255880-9625612-WA3IMicrophoneSMALL-thumb.jpg,"Something extraordinary happened Tuesday in Beirut. For the first time ever in Lebanon -- and possibly the Middle East -- several young people living with mental illness came forward before an audience of hundreds to tell their stories and raise awareness about mental illness. In a culture where mental illness is treated with silence and shame, these young trailblazers bravely shared their struggles and healing journeys to open minds and save lives. It was nothing short of revolutionary.My inspiration for spearheading this new mental health initiative came from an unexpected source. While preparing to teach a workshop on physical disability in Lebanon, I asked my host if I should discuss mental illness too. ""In Lebanon,"" he said, ""we don't see mental illness as a disability, and we never talk about in public because it brings shame."" As a mental health advocate and disability activist for over a decade, his words got me thinking about the lack of mental health advocacy and discourse in Lebanon. Since I had helped to direct a mental health awareness program for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) while a student at Brown, I began to wonder if a similar program of empowerment might work in Beirut. I knew I couldn't do it alone -- so I consulted former students of mine, like Hrag Vosgerichian, who graduated from the American University of Beirut to see if they would be interested in raising awareness about mental health in Lebanon too. With passion and vision, they got right to work and reached out to friends with mental illness in Beirut. For the name of our group, we chose the Arabic word WA3I (""awareness"") to broadcast our message and mission. And on Tuesday night, we took to the stage at the American University of Beirut with psychologist Dr. Ghina Ismail to change the conversation on mental illness in Lebanon.Raja Sabra, the brains behind the blog Raja's Punic attacks, spoke first about his experience of living with mental illness as a college student in Beirut. Struggling alone for years with the symptoms of OCD, it wasn't until he finally entered treatment that he began to understand his disordered thinking and find relief. Practicing yoga and mindfulness helped too. ""If you do something you love,"" he explained, ""it takes you away from what you're going through."" Next up was Natalie Abou Reslan, whose struggles with depression began when she was a high school student in Abu Dhabi. After entering therapy in college in Beirut, Natalie was able to stop hiding behind a ""mask"" of perfection -- a radical move in a society where plastic surgery is so ubiquitous you can get a loan for it. ""What really helped me get through everything,"" she said, ""was humor."" Writing poetry brought solace too. From her journey with mental illness, Natalie has learned empathy, acceptance, and love. ""I can still go on,"" she concluded, ""and you can still go on too."" ""I'm 20 years old,"" Loulwa Soweid began, ""and I remember having OCD since 9 years old."" As a child, Loulwa felt compelled to brush every tooth two times as a ritual before going to bed. Even in her dreams at night, she was haunted by the pull of her compulsions. Over time, with the help of her family, therapy, and medication, Loulwa began to feel free from the power of her compulsions. In a show of support, her twin sister Leah (who took the photos in this piece) named Loulwa's OCD ""Steve"" to help Loulwa see her disorder as separate from herself. In a sign of her generous spirit, Loulwa concluded: ""I kinda like to think that I'm up here talking for other people who aren't ready to talk about their disorders.""Our last speaker was Miriam Atallah -- a mental health pioneer in Lebanon for her ""It Gets Brighter"" video on trichotillomania. While using drama therapy on stage to perform her family's confused reactions to her compulsive hair pulling, Miriam also recounted trying the most popular form of ""therapy"" in Beirut -- partying hard -- before turning to professional help. At the end of her performance, the audience joined Miriam in voicing a public vow to say no to shame and yes to uprooting the mental illness stigma ingrained in Lebanese society. Witnessing these four young mental health advocates share the highs and lows of their healing journeys, it was clear to all present that telling one's story openly and honestly is a sign of strength -- not weakness and shame. It is through the art of storytelling that we come to explore our selves and inspire individual and collective healing. Whenever we share our lived experiences without fear of judgment, it is a radical and revolutionary act. By daring to unmask mental illness in Beirut, these young speakers have just made it easier for others to reach out and get help. But there's still so much more work to be done -- we're just getting started. To get in touch with WA3I in Beirut, please contact wa3ilebanon@gmail.com"

That doesn't even take into account the indoctrinated criminalization of Black and brown people that so often leads to police brutality because officers ""fear for their lives"" even when approaching the most simple of encounters.

8,COLLEGE,University Report Card 2.0: Global Equity and Biomedical Research,"Christopher Noble, ContributorGraduate Student, Global Health Advocate, Californian",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/university-report-card-20_1_b_7176504.html,Universities are positioned as institutions devoted to the research and discovery of innovations for the benefit of the public that supports them.,2015-05-04,2015-04-30-1430354006-922357-UniversityDecision.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-30-1430354006-922357-UniversityDecision-thumb.jpg,"Co-authored with Merith Basey (Executive Director, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines), Warren Kaplan (Clinical Assistant Professor, Global Health Center for Global Health & Development,Boston University School of Public Health)This year at the Consortium of Universities for Global Health Conference, Atul Gawande, surgeon, writer and public health researcher, made the following statement during his opening remarks:""There are more than 60,000 known ways the bodies' 13 organ systems can go wrong with over 4000 medical procedures and 6000 medicines found in the last 100 years to treat and prevent those failures. What is Global Health? It is taking this knowledge gained and distributing it to people all over the world."" Universities are positioned as institutions devoted to the research and discovery of innovations for the benefit of the public that supports them. Many are nonprofit, public-interest institutions heavily funded by government grants and taxpayer-funded sources. As the new generation of global health leaders, today's students and medical researchers have the ability to support as well as pressure these institutions to fulfill their commitment to the 8 billion plus inhabitants of this world. Far too often many medicines are made available only to those who can afford them, regardless of need or the benefit they were created to provide. The tragic result is that millions of people, mostly in the developing world, die each year simply because they don't have access to medicines that already exist. On Tuesday, April 21st 2015, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines launched their second University Report Card to hold leading global health institutions accountable to their commitments, but also to present where gaps might lie in the areas of Global Access to new innovations, Innovation and research into neglected diseases and Empowerment of the next generation of global health professionals. This year also showed an unprecedented level of collaboration and engagement from students and administrators from dozens of universities around the country. For instance, in 2013, Boston University received a disappointing C- on the report card, ranking 35th out of 54 schools surveyed. The results from this year's report card showed Boston University in a much more impressive 6th place out of 59 universities. With a Business School and School of Public Health that were both just ranked 10th in the world according to Business Insider and US News, a UAEM ranking of 35th in global health impact reflected either a need for university improvement or better measurement indicators, or both. In response to criticisms of the 2013 University Report Card expressed by BU faculty in a Lancet article, the second version of the University Report Card introduces new metrics for scoring not present in the original. Additionally, this year there are two questions that address university policies surrounding the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, a crisis that has highlighted in particular the failed pharmaceutical R&D model.Another modification was the new name, ""University Report Card: Global Health Equity and Biomedical Research,"" which better reflects what it is really measuring: University commitments to ensuring that innovative biomedical research performed in university labs will be accessible to all, and the efforts universities make to educate the next generation of global health leaders. This project is a major step towards increased much needed dialogues between students, administrators, and researchers. We can also now track university improvement. Rest assured that university administrations will vie to reach first place! We at Universities Allied for Essential Medicines believe that our institutions have an opportunity and a responsibility to improve global health through our research activities. If those same aspirations for global health were applied across the board to all universities, imagine the impact we would make then. The results of this year's report can be found on the UAEM Global Health Grades website. We should take pride in how our universities have improved, but we should also open discussions as to where gaps can still be filled. We have the opportunity to showcase the ways other universities can follow our example as an institution that prioritizes Global Health Equity and the impact of Biomedical Research. Let's together make this potential impact a reality."

Free Speech and Social Change"" lecture series, hosted by Dartmouth College's Gender Research Institute, critical race theorist and Columbia University Law School professor Kimberlé Crenshaw spoke before an intimate gathering of students, faculty and members of the community. Seated in a small auditorium, the crowd was both racially and ethnically diverse, and also included students and faculty of the queer community. Crenshaw's lecture comes at a critical juncture for the Ivy League school, which has faced increased scrutiny and commanded the attention of several national media outlets in light of conversations around faculty diversity, inclusivity of marginalized student groups and the role of single-sex Greek organizations in a contemporary university environment. Dartmouth College President Philip J. Hanlon, an alumnus of the College's Class of 1977, unveiled his vision for the school's future in a highly publicized announcement delivered early the morning of January 29. Dubbed ""Moving Dartmouth Forward"" (MDF), the plan included more than a year of steering committees, student panels and meetings with the Board of Trustees to gauge how the College would address issues of binge drinking, sexual assault and inclusivity -- what became the three pillars of Hanlon's vision. With this plan, Hanlon seeks to turn the page in the College's centuries-old history and usher in a new era of inclusivity and academic excellence such that the school may better reflect the ideals and aims that many consider an elite institution should follow. Shortly after delivering his speech to a crowded auditorium, President Hanlon put forward a longer, written form of his plan. In the plan, written under the headline concerning residential life at the College, Hanlon writes: We will explore additional avenues to create a more inclusive and diverse environment on and off campus. We will do this because it is right. We also know that a more diverse and inclusive environment will enrich our community and strengthen the academic experience, increasing intellectual growth and innovation.Given the far-reaching aspects that the plan addressed, it has dominated a large part of campus discourse since its unveiling to mixed reviews from students, faculty and experts. It was within this spirit of remaining critical and open to change that students and faculty audience members took their seats. Her lecture, entitled ""Harriet's Legacy: Navigating Intersectionality in the Age of Post-Racialism,"" offered a chance to hear an honest and uncensored opinion on race in the United States. With dialogue circulating around race and the ways in which it manifests on our own campus, audience members appeared eager to hear what Crenshaw would say.   Without hesitation, Crenshaw primed her audience with an explanation of post-racialism. Post-racialism, as she described, does not mean the opposite of a racial state -- ""nor mission accomplished."" More than a noun, she said, post-racialism is a verb. It is something people do, how people act. Post-racialism is a packaging of colorblindness that creates a more conservative, more palatable frame through which we can engage race while avoiding explicit mentions of racism. Crenshaw notes:""This frame identifies racial issues but does not locate those problems having to do with racial power and structural and institutionalized racism.""Post-racialism, in the words of Crenshaw, has undermined our ability to think critically about the current regime, as this mindset focuses primarily on the uplifting of marginalized voices. Yet it neglects discussion of potential causes of oppression and the pressuring of people of color to lower positions in society. Given the time and setting, Crenshaw's words held even greater meaning for the Dartmouth students and faculty seated before her. With Crenshaw's words sparking the audience to begin engaging with an abstract consideration of race relations, it wasn't long before a student soon raised his hand asking whether or not Crenshaw believed the Moving Dartmouth Forward plan to be a product of this post-racialism frame. Having not read the document herself, Crenshaw elected to not offer specific comments on the policy, but shared a more general insight into how similarly-minded policies, like Obama's ""My Brother's Keeper"" program, address such issues. These policies, she said, tend to focus on identifying potential solutions to work toward rather than emphasizing the various inequities and issues that necessitate them. As President Hanlon states:Whether it is by increasing diversity in faculty, enrolling a student body that is more representative or providing more social options, we will work to ensure that our community conveys a message of inclusion to every student -- no matter their gender, race, orientation, or socioeconomic background.In light of Crenshaw's discussion, one could argue that Moving Dartmouth Forward is a strategy with its roots in the post-racialism frame. The plan, however, does not address race alone, and a broader scope of assessing the plan's tenants should include gender and sexual orientation, along with a multitude of identity characteristics -- as nowhere in the plan does Hanlon acknowledge the systemic or institutionalized inequalities and oppression that these minority groups face on campus. This apparent lack of addressing such inequalities may be most evident in the plan's word choice. Rather than creating an inclusive campus or working toward an equal institution, Moving Dartmouth Forward MDF simply aspires to ""convey a message of inclusion..."" The focus is not to rectify past circumstances that have caused minority students to feel unsafe or unwelcome at the College, but to address the surface level problems that require relatively easy solutions.In turning the page on these issues, Hanlon's conceived plan for Dartmouth's future implies that rather than being tired of the problems of diversity itself, we are tired of discussing these criticisms. In not engaging more honestly and openly with issues of racism, sexism or homophobia, what chance is there to move Dartmouth forward in earnest? Moving Dartmouth Forward, instead of the silver bullet to end inequality on this campus that it was built up as, looks more like a plan to simply move on in hopes of escaping the media's spotlight on said issues. The larger focus of Crenshaw's presentation centered on intersectionality, a term she is credited for coining that describes how structural systems of marginalization based on gender, race, class or sexual orientation, interact on various levels and result in social inequities. In an intersectional mindset, it is not adequate to solely address racial or sexual discrimination, but instead how these factors, along with several others, coincide to create unique situations for each student. In neglecting to discuss the experiences of various on-campus minority groups on campus, Dartmouth further risks the continued isolation and marginalization of students with intersectional identities. To encourage and foster more diverse environments, Moving Dartmouth Forward suggests the College make an effort to admit a greater number of students from diverse backgrounds. This logic that more diversity breeds an openness to diversity may be flawed, but the remedy is still worth pursuing. As the co-chair of SPECTRA, Dartmouth's foremost LBGT social group, it's clear to me that we would be more self-sustaining if able to reach critical mass. SPECTRA was formed two years ago in the vacuum left by the dissolution of GSX, previously the central LGBT student-group at the time. How Dartmouth's main LGBT group could simply dissolve remains unclear, but the answer may be somewhere in the numbers. Given the strain of sustaining an organized queer community on campus, it's difficult to imagine groups like Queer People of Color (QPOC), or student groups for lesbians within the Latina population or transgender students in STEM fields thriving at the college. This, however, is not to say the solution is only in the numbers. What lies at the root of these issues is told by the stories of these students once matriculated. Dartmouth, like many institutions mired in history and tradition, is often slow to accept that these diverse and intersectional students demand more resources than ever before. From mental health outreach to sexual health education, it is not sufficient that these resources be offered, but that they are readily available and tailored to accommodate these individuals. Seminars and workshops discussing sexual assault, for example, must also speak to the experiences of gay men in terms of how to handle and protect themselves in potentially dangerous same-sex intimate encounters. Sexual assault is not exclusive to Greek houses. It happens when students study abroad, when they accept internships during a summer break and when they return home to visit. Discussions of sexual assault at Dartmouth's students are geared towards the heteronormative sexual and social relationships that emerge primarily in fraternity basements. Dartmouth cannot afford to fail these students by neglecting to prepare them for the spectrum of situations they may encounter in their futures. If the development of Moving Dartmouth Forward is any indicator of what is to come, it is clear that it is not just a product, but also a reflection, of the institutionalized inequalities at play on campus and within the administration. Perspective and current students wish more than the conveyance of inclusion. They require -- and rightfully deserve -- inclusion in the fullest sense of the word. Citing the invisibility and of gay black men and trans women of color, a queer-identifying Dartmouth student asked Crenshaw how she would work against the erasure of intersectional students by institutional forces. Crenshaw responded in saying that you must first ""go beyond the myth"" by dispelling your assumptions and rejecting the frame, and ""ask the other question."" More, you must ""talk to the excluded and develop the public will.""If diversity and inclusion are to remain compatible pursuits where one must not come at the cost of the other, then we must follow this process and reject the frame in which Moving Dartmouth Forward was conceived and is currently being implemented. If diversity and inclusion are to remain compatible pursuits where one must not come at the cost of the other, then we must dispel our assumptions and both face the true reality and our role in it. For in Moving Dartmouth Forward, we risk leaving behind the very communities President Hanlon and administrators claim to support. In looking at the short run, however, I think asking the various minority communities and stakeholders what we think and how we feel would be a good place to start.(Photo Credit: Dartmouth College)"

Many large media outlets interviewed scientists around the globe who chimed in on the ethical implications of the science, which ultimately could lead to designer babies. Some prominent scientists and bioethicists raised loud concerns about how genetic engineering might affect the future of humanity, and some of them went so far as to advocate for a moratorium on the research and technology.Scientists and medical doctors at the US Transhumanist Party, a political organization that prides itself on advancing science, condemned calls for any moratorium, saying such talk is anti-progress and anti-innovation. However, Transhumanist Party scientists did agree that an open and thorough discussion on the matter is warranted.""We are at a time in human history when such radical genetic engineering technology may help eliminate disease and give us healthier children,"" said Dr. L. M. Memmel, a researcher, board-certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist, and Treasurer of the Transhumanist Party. ""We should proceed with caution and an open discussion, but let's not derail the train before it has left the station.""Historically, scientific moratoriums have done little to stop progress, anyway. What they usually end up doing is giving other, less visible researchers and entrepreneurs the upper hand. When George W. Bush restricted federal funding for stem cell research in the United States--something he did primarily because of religious convictions--the research went overseas. Inevitably, other countries pursuing the science gained a notable advantage.Jose Cordeiro, MBA, PhD, who is a faculty professor at Singularity University and the Technology Advisor of the US Transhumanist Party says, ""Genetic manipulation of embryos should continue within ethical boundaries, and if the USA does not do it, other countries will do it.""Transhumanism, which literally means beyond human, is a growing international social movement that advocates for using science and technology to radically enhance the human being. Some of these technologies include robotic hearts, cranial implants, artificial limbs, exoskeleton suits, artificial intelligence, anti-aging research, and of course, the burgeoning field of genetic engineering.Many major scientific breakthroughs and advances in the last few centuries have been challenged by luddites and anti-science naysayers, who usually warned that ethics were being negated or outright broken. But human ethics, at least when it concerns science, is bound to the idea of helping the human being to live better. Genetic engineering may eventually result in the elimination of heart disease, cancer, negative hereditary disorders, and even the ability to be affected by the flu. It also could make the next generation of human beings stronger and healthier, giving parents more choice in what they might want out of a child, including eye color, height, gender, athletic skill, and intelligence.Critics--many of them fundamentally religious--worry that genetic engineering will create a race of nonhuman beings who resemble monsters. Their fears are overblown and tied more to Hollywood horror movies than actual science. The far greater likelihood is that genetic engineering will create a populace free of diseases and ailments that have plagued humanity for tens of thousands of years. In fact, genetic engineering could change the very nature of healthcare.""It could revolutionize many if not all the ways human beings are cared for,"" says Dr. Joseph N. Carey, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the University of Southern California and the Medical Advisor to the US Transhumanist Party.The one issue that many scientists and transhumanists do worry about with genetic engineering is whether only the rich will be able to afford such designer baby technology. Many transhumanists are humanitarians at heart, and they will surely advocate for sharing such important advances with all people, such that humanity as a whole may improve and become healthier than it's ever been."

These young individuals use their entrepreneurial mindset to get things done. By sharing the stories of these individuals, I hope to inspire youth from all over the world to follow their passions, to take the road less travelled and to disrupt the status quo. This is the 13th post in the Young and Entrepreneurial Series. To read previous features and to stay up to date with future features, like our Facebook page here.  ---With the demand for Computer Science (CS) graduates rising, a lot of CS students have a choice, whether to work for a big and established tech company or take the plunge in a startup or build your own startup. For 25-year-old University of Michigan Computer Science graduate Brian Clark, he would first start out in corporate life before deciding to take the leap of faith two weeks before his two-year contract with General Electric was over.Fast-forward a year and a half later and Brian has won multiple hackathons and is working on his third startup idea called LinkTexting, which helps convert desktop visitors into app downloads, generating revenue since day one. Along the way, Brian has learned his fair share of lessons that he shared with me during our interview.The Decision to leave General Electric While Brian explained how he enjoyed working for General Electric as part of the IT Leadership Rotation Program right out of college, the corporate life eventually started feeling too slow for him. He shared, ""I wasn't really learning a lot anymore during the second year. This is when I got the startup itch to do something on my own.""After he and his coworker ended up winning a startup competition hosted by the NewME accelerator, Brian and his cofounder decided to take the plunge and go to Silicon Valley to work on their winning idea. Brian along with 4 other cofounders had ended up building a widget for IOS applications where you could have a paint bar and paint on applications. The venture would end up failing due to a few reasons. Brian shared, ""It was too many cooks in the kitchen where nobody had enough to do early on for the company to go further. We weren't really familiar with how startups worked. We were mostly developers. Things like building one specific tool really well wasn't something we did. Instead of just focusing on one widget, we started building multiple things.""'Pivoting to Vue Analytics'  The team ended up trying to do too much and take on the big companies without really knowing what they were doing. The team decided to move on in January 2014, and Brian decided to move to his friend's house, without any money left. Luckily, it was perfect timing - the Launch Festival, a hackathon with more than $100,000 in investment money was just right around the corner.Brian shared, ""I ended up winning first place for my idea, Vue Analytics. It was a pivot of the first business. What I built in the hackathon was an in app mobile analytics platform where you (developers) could understand their users directly through the app. We built out the initial version and started launching to users.""However, Brian and his team members didn't know that this was a crowded space with the likes of Inercom and MixPanel already dominating the space. He shared, ""We didn't do our homework on that and we weren't able to move fast enough to differentiate ourselves.""The Birth of LinkTexting  Around that same time, Kumar Thangudu, Brian's roommate at a hacker building had come up to him with an idea to work on for a few days. While Brian initially turned down his Kumar's offer to work on it together, he ended up agreeing to work with him with an agreement that it would be branded as powered by Vue Analytics. Before they knew it, LinkTexting was generating paying users and people just kept signing up on LinkTexting. After getting posted on ProductHunt and getting hundreds of upvotes, LinkTexting was growing exponentially which led Brian to shut down Vue and just focus on LinkTexting with Kumar. He shared, ""We're running and profitable right now. We're working with a few hundred applications right now. Meerkat is using us. MSNBC is using us. For the first time ever, I've found a digital business. I've seen real growth."" Brian and his team at the SalesForce hackathonProlific Hackathon WInner  In between all this, Brian had won over $150,000 through hackathons (you can read more about the specifics in Brian's Medium blog post here). This is where he got the funds that kept him going despite his failed startup ventures. He shared his winning formula, ""You have to understand what the judges are looking for if you want to win. Try starting out with how you will pitch your idea then based on that, build your product backwards. Don't build anything that isn't being pitched.""Brian also emphasized the beauty in knowing how to code, ""It really opens up your ability to try a lot of things. If you have an idea, if you know how to program just a little bit, you can spin up a very basic version of what your idea is. These things can be spun up in a couple of weeks. Just being able to do that quickly on your own is extremely empowering. ""Given this, Brian has been involved with a non-profit organization called Mission Fit , which helps middle school and high school students learn to code, ever since he moved to San Francisco. His friend Tyson had this idea of helping middle and high school students learn how to code. Brian decided to jump in and teach the students during his free time. Given the number of hackathons he has been to, Brian has seen all types of hacks. However his favorite hack will still be the talking Teddy Bear his team built that could read to children. He shared, ""I just love hackathons. Coding for 23, 24 hours straight then getting to pitch on stage in front of a lot of people is just a crazy experience.""Life as an Entrepreneur  Brian shared the best thing about being an entrepreneurship, ""It's just about being really challenged. You put yourself in a position where you can grow and learn. I'm just really trying to build up my sales, marketing, business development skills. I just never really got this opportunity before in GE as an IT guy.""Having shipped numerous products and applications, Brian is a big fan of the lean startup model. He shared, ""Usually the first answer isn't ""go build your product"". An example of that is a friend of mine wanted to do something in the AirBnb for offices space. Rather than build an entire platform, get an excel spreadsheet and manually match them. Whether it's pretty or not, if you're able to solve a person's core problem, you will sell be able to sell to them. Build your landing page then build your first version of a product.""Brian's advice to young entrepreneurs was, ""You're not going to know what you want to do until you realize what it's actually really like. I didn't really really know what it was like to start a startup. But one thing I would say is to pick something you want to be known for. Then start working hard and getting known for that one thing really well.""One thing is for sure, Brian is now known for being able to ship prototypes of ideas over a weekend after winning one hackathon after the other in the past year. You can head over to his Medium post here to read more about that.*This is the 13th post in the Young and Entrepreneurial Series.

So we have done another data deep dive and compared the average airfares (round trip and including taxes) to the 25 European airports our users search the most in the first three months of the year. We calculated the average airfare based on flight prices from almost two dozen airports in cities across the U.S.First off, the average were all below $1,000. So this may be the summer of the European vacation. And, if Ireland, Italy or Spain are on your bucket list, we have even better news. Six of the eight most affordable airports where in those three countries. In addition, showing that alternative airports can be, well, a good alternative in Europe too, Paris' Orly Airport is number two on the list, besting the bigger and busier Charles De Gualle. And London's Gatwick certainly has the potential to deliver better deals than Heathrow. These airports may require a stop over, but imagine a day in Lisbon or Madrid thrown in as part of the deal.As is always the case, these airfares are snapshot, and prices will vary with exact dates and departure points.

Better yet, it is hard to understand why we are still here. Why would anyone have to declare that Black Lives Matter in 2015? Isn't the fact that all lives matter, including Black lives, obvious? Why is it that over a century after the Emancipation Proclamation and many decades after The Montgomery Bus Boycott, Brown vs. Board of Education, and The March on Washington, many African-Americans continue to feel politically disenfranchised, economically disempowered and physically at-risk?Indeed, African Americans feel this way because it is true! According to the Pew Research Center, the wealth of White households was 13 times the median wealth of Black households in 2013. The March 2015 unemployment rate for Black Americans was 10.4%,which is nearly twice that of the White American unemployment rate of 4.7% . Moreover, historian Isabel Wilkerson points out that the rate of White police officers fatally killing Black men in the seven years ending in 2012 was about twice a week, which is eerily similar to the rate of at which Black men were lynched in the Jim Crow South for mundane infractions, every four days. Why does it seem like the more things change, the more they stay the same, and what does that have to do with my title which discusses the need for diversity in children's animation? Things have stayed the same because, in part, the American mindset surrounding white superiority and black inferiority has not changed. During the ground-breaking Supreme Court case, Brown vs. Board of Education, psychologist Kenneth Clarke presented data that African American children were being psychologically harmed by segregation. During the 1950's, Dr. Clark demonstrated this by revealing evidence that when asked questions about inanimate black and white dolls, Black children generally associated all positive attributes in terms of beauty, intelligence and morality to the white doll and all negative attributes to the black doll. In 2010, CNN commissioned psychologists to recreate the test, testing both White and Black children, and the results were the same! Moreover, White children were far more biased and more likely to attribute positive attributes to whiteness and negative attributes to blackness than their African-American counterparts. Because many of the children interviewed were so young (kindergarten age), it is highly unlikely that their perceptions were formed by personal experiences. It is more likely that their perceptions are being shaped by their families and the media. If children who are as young as five years old harbor such deep rooted bias against people with browner complexions (even when they have brown complexions themselves), then it should not be surprising that research has demonstrated that white job applicants with felony convictions fare as well or better than black applicants with clean backgrounds. Nor is it surprising that video game simulations reveal that Americans of all races have a pronounced bias to shoot unarmed African-Americans. How do we eliminate the bias against black skin which seems to be so inextricably linked to issues of discrimination that have a real impact on the progress of African-Americans? I certainly do not have all of the answers. Economic investment, legal reform and improvements in education are certainly needed. But, I also believe that positive multicultural media is part of the solution. Children are especially in need of multicultural images during their formative years.The campaign We Need Diverse Books has been immensely successful with respect to raising awareness about the issue of diverse children's books. As an author, education consultant, boutique publisher and distributor of multicultural and socially conscious children's books, I completely understand the need for diverse books, but I do not personally feel the lack of diverse books. Just Us Books is a twenty-six year-old publishing house devoted entirely to multicultural children's literature. The diverse children's books of authors such as myself, Jabari Asim, Natasha Anastasia Tarpley, Tamara Pizzoli, Wade Hudson, Floyd Cooper, Michael Wynn, Ashanti McMilllon, Setsu Shigematsu, Betty K. Bynum, Grace Lin, Trish Cooke, Barbara M. Joose, Crystal Swain-Bates, Cathryn Falwell, Tulani Thomas, Ylleya Fields, Rachel Isadora, Shana Bernabela and many more are all on my shelves. My two preschool aged boys, routinely ask for the works of those authors. I also recommend many of these authors in my professional development courses on culturally responsive teaching.  Sunne's Gift Courtesy of Milestales Publishing and Education ConsultingHowever, I have a much harder time finding diverse animation to watch with my pre-schoolers and to recommend in my courses. Some of the obscure DVDs and youtube videos that I have watched in my search for diverse animation have content that is too mature, sassy or stereotypical. Like it or not, most children watch TV and university studies have shown that the more television that White girls and children of color watch, the lower their self-esteem due to the lack of positive television imagery of girls and all children of color.All children deserve positive and empowering representations of themselves. Thankfully, a very new crop of independent animators of African descent is emerging to fill this gap. I highlight three of them below.  Bino and Fino Courtesy of Bino and Fino.comI was delighted when I came across Bino and Fino in this Baby and Blog post on animation. My children own the first Bino and Fino DVD and watch various youtube clips and we love it! Bino and Fino is about a brother and sister who live in a modern Sub-Saharan African city. Each day, they discover new things with the help of a magical butterfly named Zeena. Adamu Waziri of Nigeria created the series because he wanted children to be able to enjoy African culture through the power of animation. ""I believe that children should be able to see positive representations of themselves and other cultures and races. If they don't, a poor foundation is set where they think that they are superior or inferior to another culture or race. This can last up until adulthood and has subtle to outright dangerous implications"", says Waziri. Waziri concedes that producing the animated series has had its challenges. The series is completely produced in Nigeria and training and retaining animators is challenging given the brain drain pressures that many African countries face, but he says that it is worth it. Additionally, Bino and Fino does not have the large marketing budget of mainstream studios so the team depends on stakeholders who understand the need for diverse animation. These stakeholders purchase the DVDs and tell others about the show. Please check out the Bino and Fino website and Facebook page to learn more. http://www.binoandfino.com/ http://www.facebook.com/binoandfinoThe Book of Mojo The Book of Mojo. Courtesy of Everett DowningEverett Downing, creator of the Book of Mojo, echoes Waziri's belief in the power of imagery. ""Imagery is powerful. The media has a very dramatic effect on our psyches. The effect it has on children is quite dramatic. Children are very impressionable, it's built into their DNA so they can learn and adapt quickly. They take what they see as law. When my child watches television, and she sees that most all of the heroes are white, then she starts to feel displaced. She begins to feel that something is wrong with her. I know this because she expressed this to me. I try to buy diverse books, but it is still hard because the effect of popular culture is very powerful"", says Downing. This situation partly inspired Downing to leverage his fifteen years of animation experience at Pixar, Dreamworks and Blue Sky to create his own animated story, The Book of Mojo. The Book of Mojo follows a thirteen year old runaway witch named Creepy and an enchanted statue named Mojo. Creepy wants to learn magic to reunite with her father, and Mojo has an unknown origin that threatens both of them. Downing hopes to raise $80k to fund this action packed story. You can support the campaign on IndieGogo here. . Everett believes that major studios do not invest in diverse films because they believe that they can't sell. His greatest advice to people who want to see diverse animation is to financially support diverse animation and spread the word about such shows and movies. Please check out the Book of Mojo website and Indiegogo pages. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-book-of-mojo-animated-pilot http://www.bookofmojo.com/ Beautiful Danger Beautiful Danger. Courtesy of Doll Face Animated Films.Kimberly Jesika of Doll Face Animated Films felt a particular need to show positive representations of women in animation, especially African-American women. ""Very seldom do you see a brown girl in animations ever living happily ever after, kicking butt, saving the day, figuring out a mystery or just having her dreams come true"", says Jesika. Jesika wanted inspire girls of African descent to see their own possibilities. In her upcoming movie, Beautiful Danger, an ancient war eradicates nearly all of civilized life and a diverse cast of characters has to engage in an epic battle to save the universe. Please check out Doll Face Animated Films' website and facebook page so that you can keep up with the Beautiful Danger production process. http://dollfaceanimatedfilms.com https://www.facebook.com/dollfaceanimatedfilms?fref=tsWith great people such as Adamu Waziri, Everett Downing and Kimberly Jesika, working diligently to create empowering and diverse animated images, I have great hope that the way that African-American children see themselves and the way that children of other races see African Americans will soon change. Hopefully future generations will no longer have to declare that Black Lives Matter and we will see an immense cultural shift with respect to the opportunities available to people of all races, genders, and economic backgrounds.Please email me at milestalespublishing@gmail.com if you know of other diverse and empowering chidren's books and media."

In the background there is encouraging music, my avatar girl jumps up and down and is full of beans. Before the journey started, I was even able to pick out a hairstyle, clothes, shoes and define my three major goals in life: master my education, climb a mountain and be content with my job. One level further means you've reached a life goal.Alex Kayle, employee of the South African health organization HIVSA, patiently explains the rules of the game to me. For example, I am allowed to meet up with boys and to sleep with them too, but only if I have collected a condom beforehand. There are also bonus points if I commit myself to just one partner, but it's really not so easy to distinguish all the boys from each other. The tempo increases the whole time, and I obviously become too adventurous - because suddenly the fun is over and I've lost.Interactive online format ""Choma""The online game has been available in the app store for a few weeks and is fairly popular -- I have already discovered it on the mobile phones of a few acquaintances here in South Africa. It is part of a whole series of interactive, online formats developed for the Choma Project to help young girls with questions about boys, sex, relationships, but also fashion, lifestyle and friendship.""Choma means best friend, and that's what we all are here"", says Alex. ""I am a choma, the girls are chomas, all together we form a community in which we can talk openly about any topic at all.""Choma was launched in October 2013 in partnership with the Charlize Theron Outreach Project and the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ). At that time, HIVSA was running a few projects looking after young, pregnant and HIV-positive women. But there was no contact point for young women who were struggling with really everyday questions about love, school, health and their future. Choma is aimed at this target group, and wants to help them by way of counseling and education work. Only 26 percent of girls know about the infectiousness of HIVOf the 400,000 new HIV infections each year in South Africa, around half are young girls between 15 and 25 years of age -- they contract the virus at four times the rate of boys at the same age. Many young girls are still not properly educated about the risks of the sexually transmitted disease. In one study, only about a third of all surveyed said that they use a condom during sexual intercourse, almost the same number are aware of the contagiousness of HIV.Eighty percent think that they are not at risk of infection because they trust their partner or because they want to wait to have sex. The problem is that the young girls who make up the major risk group for HIV infection don't perceive this very risk. On the contrary -- they act naively, have sex very young, without a condom, with different partners, who are mostly much older.Education programs have so far remained unsuccessful. In school classes the topic receives scant attention, and those who no longer go to school can no longer be reached by those programs anyway. Often girls talk to their girlfriends about it, but they're just as poorly informed. At home, conversations about sex and relationships are taboo. So it is high time that fresh, new ideas and projects are developed, to help these girls out where politics and society have previously failed. How social media can educate about HIVBy now, about 80 percent of all students in South Africa 14 years and over own a mobile phone, and use it to get online. Via social media channels such as Facebook or Mxit, they chat with one another, post, comment, blog, argue with each other. Mxit alone boasts almost 10 million active users, mostly between 12 and 18 years old. Choma can be downloaded via Mxit, and more than 80 per cent of chomas use the platform on their mobile. Since the launch in October 2013, around 800,000 girls have downloaded the online magazine -totally eclipsing the expectations of the project organisers. 24 hours a day, two moderators tend to the questions that the girls send in to ""Ask Choma."" The chat can be carried out publicly or privately. Profile pictures and usernames can be designed as the girls wish, in order to remain anonymous.Once a week, Dr. Sindi gives tips on health and wellbeing on her blog. Alongside the numerous online offers, Choma is also trying to get people involved offline. For this, they offer workshops in schools and universities, which particularly committed Chomas can help to organise.Looking for new funding modelsBecause the project is so successful and the girls' questions are increasing every day (10,000 in the past three months), more employees need to be hired. Jean Armstrong, the director of HIVSA, explains to me that the organization is on the lookout for new, sustainable funding models, in order to continue working independently in the long-term.To do so, she also wants to encourage private donors and companies to support the project. In South Africa, that is not as easy as I have found in my interviews with other organisations during my lab around the world. What is lacking above all is the willingness on the part of politicians to support the work of non-government organisations through public campaigns and funding programs. In the long run, Choma wants to contribute to an HIV-free generation. That might sound like an ambitious goal, but it's not impossible. What's important is that the urgency of the problem, as well as the successes of these kinds of projects, are finally acknowledged both by politicians and by society at large.

Protesters remained on the City Hall lawn despite a deadline, set by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, to dismantle their campsite and leave the park which the city declared closed as of 12:01 am November 28th.

As practices like yoga and meditation are increasingly embraced by everyone from business leaders to pro athletes, many politicians are also reaping the benefits -- and some have been doing so quietly for many years. That includes mayors, who are generally more popular and considered more effective than national representatives in Congress. Gallup polls reveal that for the past decade, Americans consistently have had a greater trust and confidence in their local government than their state or federal governments. Here, four mayors from across the country share the wellness habits they’ve built and maintained in order to reduce stress, live healthier, become more effective leaders, and, especially, make better decisions in their high-pressure jobs.Tom Henry, Mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana“I was going into the locker room at the local YMCA a few years ago, and a friend of mine who was coming out was about to go into yoga class. He convinced me to attend and I was hooked,” Fort Wayne Mayor Tom Henry told The Huffington Post. Henry now practices for half an hour every evening, although his movements have become somewhat limited since injuring his right thigh last year.When asked if he has noticed a difference in his work mentality since starting the practice, Henry responded, “Undoubtedly, no question about it. The whole idea is to relax and go through these flowing movements, which helped relieve my stress. Before I had been very impatient. Now I approach things in a calmer fashion.”Finding peace is especially necessary for a Democrat in Indiana. “After the fiasco with the state’s religious freedom law earlier this month, I needed a whole lot of positions to relax after that,” Henry said.Betsy Price, Mayor of Fort Worth, Texas“I do Pilates every Monday night, which is a great way for me to de-stress since the teacher doesn’t allow any talking. [It's] a nice break from a job that primarily involves talking,” Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price told HuffPost.She says her practice helps her manage relationships better, citing as an example the main local issue when she was first elected in 2011: an overhaul of public pensions. “It was very contentious, and having been in meetings all day Monday, it was difficult to go to Pilates that night,” said Price. “Tuesday was the vote on the pensions themselves, which made it much easier to talk to and negotiate with council members to get something done.”It’s easier on the family too. “When you go home, you’re not as likely to lash out at them,” explained Price, who will “sometimes close the door to my office and do yoga poses for a few minutes.” She added that she always does breathing exercises to calm down before her State of the City address every year, which takes place in front of several thousand people.“It’s amazing what downward dog can do,” Price said.Buddy Dyer, Mayor of Orlando, Florida“I struggled with my weight for the better part of my adult life. It was a constant battle for me,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer told HuffPost. “Then a few years ago I led a trade mission to Israel. They eat well there and at the first dinner, we started with an appetizer which people thought was the entire meal. By the time I got back, I could not button my pants.” Over the course of the next several months, he lost and kept off 35 pounds by changing his diet and exercising. He added yoga and stretching to his daily routine.“If you’re in public life, you go to two receptions and a dinner every night. It’s hard physically,” Dyer said, noting the importance of treating your body right. “For example, getting a good night’s rest. I’m 56 now. I recognize the importance of that far more than when I was 21.”Ed Murray, Mayor of Seattle, Washington“In college [at the University of Portland] in Oregon, I would regularly visit a Trappist monastery. I became very involved in using Zen meditation technique, Catholic prayer and the combination of the two,” Murray told The Huffington Post. He said he also was very influenced by the writings of Thomas Merton, an author who advocated interfaith dialogue, especially with Buddhism. “Now I meditate 20 to 25 minutes each day before work,"" he said.“Never meditate expecting some benefit. It just exists for itself,” Murray said. He added that it gives him perspective in his day-to-day busy schedule. “When I’m [meditating] regularly, I feel far more centered. I’m calmer, I’m clearer, less frustrated.”"

Tony Hsieh delivered happiness. Martin Luther King inspired a dream.What connects these three? The result of asking: What would I like to see? What matters to me? How can I make things in my world better?Steve Jobs focused on the experience he would want as a consumer. Tony Hsieh created the environment he would want as an employee. MLK held a nation spellbound with what he would want as a citizen and as an individual. While the focus may vary, we are all moved by passionate purpose. We rarely act from reason. We act from feeling. That's why our leaders all start with a dream, not a plan. They are anchored in personal purpose. And when a cause is truly personal, it becomes universal. Oftentimes, your cause -- your ""why"" -- isn't immediately clear. Rather, it is the result of intimately knowing the ""what"" and ""how"" of your business (whether your business is raising children or running a Fortune 500) and then tuning in to what excites and disturbs you about it, what you'd like to see done differently. From there, a compelling and mobilizing ""why"" will naturally emerge.By focusing on what matters to you, you benefit and connect with others, who then feed that energy back to you. A virtuous cycle. THAT is how you profit from your passion.If we lead from purpose instead of profit, evolution will ensue. If profit precedes purpose, extinction will be the result. So now it's your turn. What's personal to you? What specific action steps will you take to lead from that purpose?

Not even baseball was safe: One team had folded; a whole league disbanded. Wilkinson owned the Kansas City Monarchs, a winning team, but their daytime games made it impossible for working fans to attend. Additionally, the Monarchs were members of the Negro National League and didn’t have their own stadium. Under the shadow of Jim Crow, where few stores and hotels would cater to them, playing baseball required lots of travel in unwelcoming conditions. And, while mostly black crowds attended the Monarchs’ games, the efforts to attract new white fans were fruitless...Read more on TIME"

Hundreds of people called out Trout for supporting a fighter with quite a checkered-past, most notably with domestic violence arrests.Trout is the best player in baseball and has a squeaky clean image -- generally because he is a squeaky clean guy. It is actually news that he was rooting for a less than honorable citizen in a boxing match.MLB.com reported that Trout was ""told to stay away from further tweets about the fight"". The article did not say who told him to stay away.But the Twitterati basically told him to stay away anyway.So apparently, nobody can use the tools of technology without being shamed, scolded and cajoled by whoever squawks up to the Twitter microphone. And the powers that be shrink in the face of the online ""Mob Rules"" pseudo-activism.We don't know who Mickey Mantle was rooting for when Cassius Clay fought Sonny Liston in 1964. Back then there wasn't an outlet for an athlete to reach his audience directly and talk about things that he enjoyed off the field. We didn't have Twitter back then, and now we do, but Mike Trout just got told not to tweet about some things.So we are back to 1964 in a lot of ways. That is not progress."
