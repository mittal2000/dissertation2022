Looking at historical temperatures and weather patterns is always helpful, too. If you know someone who has spent time where you're going, talk to them.2. Lay out everything you think you want to pack and put back half. My mom has been telling me to do this for years, but until I decided to move to South America for a semester, I didn't realize how important and useful this advice was. Be very strict with what you discard -- even if there is a little bit of extra space left at the end of the process, leave it alone. You will have access to laundry facilities (or soap and water) anywhere in the world -- the locals have to wash their clothing too -- so don't worry about not having a fresh outfit every day.3. On the way there, fold your clothes. On the way home, roll them. Chances are, by the end of your excursion your clothes are mostly dirty and you'll be trying to cram in the clothes/other souvenirs into your suitcase anyway. Generally speaking, rolling your clothes takes up less room than folding them does. However, some items (sweatshirts, some jeans, etc) are easier to pack flat. Experiment with what you're taking to discover the best method for you.4. Pack clothes that all match. I have a lot of solid, neutral colored pieces that can mix and match in almost any combination. If you have to be dressier, consider bringing jewelry or a flashier cardigan/scarf/other accessory.5. Scarves, scarves, scarves. This is where to get creative with the colors/patterns/etc. You don't need to bring one for every outfit, but they can brighten up an outfit and can go with almost anything.6. Minimize your shoes. I love shoes, and own way more than I actually wear on a regular basis. When you're traveling, wear the heaviest/bulkiest pair even if they aren't the easiest to slip on and off in the security line. For this trip, I have a pair of black ballet flats, my red Toms, a pair of sandals and my five-year-old Sperrys. If needed, I can discard them en route, but as of now everything still fits with extra room in my carry-on.7. Bring and use gallon-size ziplock bags. Do not think that you can buy them anywhere in the world -- ziplock bags are apparently not sold throughout the world. Whether you're masking the smell of shoes, keeping your clean underwear away from everything else, or providing a waterproof safe-house for your phone or camera when you leave your umbrella behind, these come in handy on an overly-regular basis.8.Leave the hair products and styling do-dads at home. My hair is short enough not to really benefit from a hair dryer or straightener, but unless you are overly specific about your hair care, buy what you need when you arrive or forego it altogether. This only takes up space that could be used in a much better way.9. Leave room for a sweater or another significantly warm jacket. Even if you think you'll always be warm or that you'll never need anything warmer than a light jacket, you will most likely be surprised. I, stupidly, didn't realize that the sun would set by about 6 p.m. in Windhoek... thus the temperature would drop significantly. Luckily, I'm always freezing in airplanes so I had a sweatshirt with me.10. Don't be afraid to discard items. Unless you have one-of-a-kind tailored clothes, you can always replace something.

2,BLACK VOICES,Black Women in the Fight Against Police Brutality,"William Lynch III, ContributorVice President, New Business Initiatives, Bill Lynch Associate...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-women-in-the-fight-against-police-brutality_b_7425406.html,"Mosby's courageous decision to prosecute makes her just one of the many black women over the decades who have worked hard to quell the scourge of police brutality. Black women have played a substantial role in bringing national and international attention to the issue, both in the past and today.",2015-05-23,"Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore state's attorney, speaks during a media availability, Friday, May 1, 2015 in Baltimore. Mosby announced criminal charges against all six officers suspended after Freddie Gray suffered a fatal spinal injury while in police custody. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0d7f2400003100965306.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Baltimore, we witnessed yet another black victim of police brutality. This time it was Freddie Gray, joining a long list of deaths we've heard about, and ones we haven't. It pains me that there are a handful of unscrupulous cops, among the thousands of upstanding officers, who turn to excessive violence when engaging with citizenry. Nonetheless, the ray of hope is that State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby charged the six officers accused of pummeling Gray's spine, and a grand jury chose to indict. Mosby did not cave in to political pressure, in stark contrast to former Staten Island DA and newly minted congressman Dan Donovan. As I discussed the other day, Donovan seemingly let Officer Daniel Pantaleo off the hook for Eric Garner's murder because of his longstanding political support from the law enforcement worker unions.Mosby's courageous decision to prosecute makes her just one of the many black women over the decades who have worked hard to quell the scourge of police brutality. Black women have played a substantial role in bringing national and international attention to the issue, both in the past and today. However, the news media and history books have not done a good job recording all the contributions by so many black women. (In fact, there are so many that I cannot do them all justice in a blog post, so I apologize in advance for some glaring omissions.)In 1960, Patricia Stephens Due drew national attention to police brutality and the unjust legal system in Florida, a southern state that folks don't usually associate with Jim Crow. While a student at Florida A&M University, Stephens Due was arrested for taking part in a peaceful sit-in at a Tallahassee Woolworth's. After being released, she joined her fellow students in a peaceful march to protest the arrest, during which a police officer threw a teargas canister at her face. Stephens Due suffered permanent eye damage that resulted in her wearing sunglasses at all times for the rest of her life, giving her and anyone who saw her a reminder of the consequences of police brutality.After she and the other participants were convicted on multiple counts for the sit-in, Stephens Due became a pioneer of the ""jail-in"": She and some of the others convicted opted to serve a 49-day jail sentence instead of paying a fine. The incarcerated protesters gained national attention, and received support from civil rights leaders including James Baldwin, Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry Belafonte (my father's dear friend). Jackie Robinson even mailed them diaries so they could record the experience. Martin Luther King, Jr. sent them a telegram offering his support. Besides the prominent activists, ordinary folks came daily to the jail to express their support, until visitors were banned.Stephens Due would go on to co-write with her daughter a book about her experience, Freedom in the Family. She also discussed it in a 2011 talk. Patricia Stephens Due was hardly the only female civil rights activist to be the victim of police brutality. The civil rights icon Fannie Lou Hamer also experienced it firsthand, and publicized it to the world. In 1963, while riding a bus home from a voter education workshop, she was arrested when the bus stopped in Winona, Mississippi. An officer violently put her in a squad car and took her to jail. After being called racial epithets, she was placed in a cell where the police forced two black prisoners to beat her. Hamer recounted her story in multiple speeches, including at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, when she famously showed up as part of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation:When I went to get in the [patrol] car, when the man told me I was under arrest, he kicked me. The speech drew major media coverage. Hamer would go on to deliver similar speeches across the country, including one at a Mississippi church, which was burned to the ground later that evening, and again in Harlem with Malcolm X.Black women also publicized the issue of police brutality when they were savagely beaten on Bloody Sunday during the Selma to Montgomery March. The ""police"" force, which included a number of civilians deputized that day, used nightsticks and tear gas on the marchers. March organizer Hosea Williams said, ""I fought in World War II and I once was captured by the German army, and I want to tell you that the Germans never were as inhuman as the state troopers of Alabama."" Among the victims that day was one of the march organizers, Amelia Boynton (now Amelia Boynton Robinson), who was beaten unconscious. Photographs of men helping an unconscious Boynton would end up published in national and international press. Boynton's image helped galvanize the passage of the Voting Rights Act, and she attended the White House ceremony where Lyndon B. Johnson signed it into law. Additionally, the FBI immediately began an investigation of the event, and concluded the police used excessive force. The investigation even specifically cited Boynton. Boynton Robinson, who is still alive, joined President Obama in Selma this year to mark the 50th anniversary of the march.Other female activists were also on the receiving end of police brutality that day. Marie Foster was beaten while lying on the ground, and had tear gas thrown at her, as she recounted in an interview with UPI. Also at the march was Clara Luper, who was clubbed in the knee. And Sheyann Webb, who at age 8 was the youngest marcher that day, managed to avoid a physical beating but suffered an emotional one. Webb later recounted her story in the book Selma, Lord, Selma.Other black women in the Civil Rights Era publicized police brutality in a form other than recounting personal beatings. Instead, some did so with song. In 1962, SNCC formed the Freedom Singers, a gospel vocal group that for most of its history was comprised of two women and two men: Bernice Johnson, Rutha Mae Harris, Cordell Reagon and Charles Neblett. Through song, the group told stories of police brutality and other struggles of the movement, generally by putting new lyrics to existing spirituals. Another activist who used song was world-renowned singer Nina Simone. She was so incensed with violence and inequality in the south that in 1964 she released the bluntly-titled protest song ""Mississippi Goddam"" to express her frustration. She would go on to sing it live at the conclusion of the Selma march. Simone later said she felt the song permanently hurt her career.It's thanks in part to these female trailblazers that the scourge of police brutality became widely known to the nation and world. Their work for freedom and equality helped pave the way for future generations of black women combating police brutality. In addition to Marilyn Mosby, there are other elected officials such as California Attorney General Kamala Harris, New York City Public Advocate Letitia James, and just about every congresswoman of color, to name but a few. And of course, today's generation of black women fighting police brutality is hardly limited to elected officials: there are also the numerous grassroots activists. That includes my friend Hazel Dukes, president of the New York State chapter of the NAACP, who works tirelessly to create a fairer criminal justice system. One high profile example was the 2012 Silent March Against Stop-and-Frisk that she organized with my office and others, which brought mainstream attention to this unjust police practice. This month, Mayor de Blasio himself called the march the start of ""an extraordinary movement...which I was very honored to participate in with my family.""Another activist working hard today is Michelle Alexander, whose book The New Jim Crow has exposed how today's codified laws and policies continue to oppress people of color. Recently, she spoke out against the conditions in Baltimore and the need to organize against police brutality.Tragically, a number of black women today only became involved in the anti-police brutality movement after having lost a loved one, in most cases their own children. There are the high profile ones, such as Michael Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden, and Eric Garner's mother Gwen Carr (who won an award named for my father). Unfortunately, there are far too many more, enough to constitute a whole group, Mothers Against Police Brutality.The black women I talked about above are only some of the many who have contributed to the civil rights movement and the fight against police brutality. They may not all be household names, but they played an important role just like their male counterparts. One step in this continued push to end police brutality is Marilyn Mosby's prosecution of these Baltimore officers. But there is a still a whole lot of work to be done, by women and men both."
3,POLITICS,GOP Calls For 'Honoring' Troops By Funding A War Congress Won't Vote On,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-war-authorization-republicans_n_7424658.html,,2015-05-23,"FILE - In this June 11, 2014 file photo, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington. Republicans retained control of the House in this weekâs election, but because of retirements and party-imposed term limits on committee chairmen, more than half a dozen committees will be getting new chairmen. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fb6f200000c70101dd88.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- It's Memorial Day weekend, and congressional Republicans are using their weekly video address to the nation to call for ""honoring our commitment"" to U.S. troops. But they're making a curious argument on how to show that commitment: They want President Barack Obama to support a House-passed defense authorization bill that provides more funding for the war against the Islamic State -- the same war that Congress hasn't taken the time to debate, authorize or vote on.Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, delivered this week's GOP address. He said Congress has passed annual defense authorization bills for 53 years to ensure that the military has the resources it needs. House Republicans passed their version of this year's bill on May 15.""It gives our troops a raise and updates their benefits,"" said Thornberry. ""It eases our war fighters’ transition to the VA and it makes sure we get the most value possible for the taxpayer dollars.""That may all be true. But the bill also lets Congress spend another $89.2 billion on funding operations like the military campaign against the Islamic State. It's been nine months since Obama began directing airstrikes against the terrorist group, and he's been doing so without new congressional authorization. The Constitution requires Congress to declare wars, but in this case, Obama said he doesn't need lawmakers' sign-off because a sweeping 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force covers his actions. Lawmakers disputed that point for months, so the president sent them a new, Islamic State-specific AUMF proposal in February, saying that he welcomed their vote on it even though he doesn't think he needs it.Nothing has happened since.Congress has barely touched the AUMF because lawmakers disagree on how to shape it and because, frankly, many don't want their fingerprints on a new war authorization in case something goes awry. But their failure to act leaves the U.S. engaged in a war with no parameters on its length, cost or endgame. The U.S. has already spent more than $2.1 billion on the effort, participated in more than 4,000 airstrikes and sent 3,000 military personnel to Iraq.And that war continues to escalate. Last week, Islamic State forces captured the Iraqi city of Ramadi, and in recent days they have almost entirely seized control of the Syrian town of Palmyra. White House officials have been on the defensive, walking a fine line on whether Obama plans to send more troops to Iraq. Republicans on Capitol Hill have been lining up to criticize Obama's military approach. But through it all, Congress still hasn't authorized the war itself.A handful of House Democrats tried to offer AUMF amendments to the defense authorization bill last week when it was being debated, but Republicans blocked them. One GOP lawmaker said he agreed that Congress has a responsibility to authorize wars, but said it's not appropriate to do so during debate on the National Defense Authorization Act. That left some Democrats flabbergasted.""This is the NDAA. This is the bill. This funds the wars. This notion that this doesn't belong here, well, where the hell does it belong?"" asked Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). ""We treat war as if it's nothing. We have men and women in harm's way. ... This is disgraceful."""

Tony Perkins, president of the Washington-based Christian lobbying group, said Thursday, May 21, 2015, that he has accepted the resignation of Duggar in the wake of the reality TV star's apology for unspecified bad behavior as a young teen. (AP Photo/Danny Johnston, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4baef240000510097abbe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Police in Arkansas have destroyed records detailing the investigation into sexual abuse allegations against TLC's ""19 Kids and Counting"" star Josh Duggar.“The judge ordered us yesterday to expunge that record,” Springdale Police spokesman Scott Lewis told The Associated Press on Friday. ""As far as the Springdale Police Department is concerned this report doesn't exist.""Lewis also told the AP that these types of records are usually kept indefinitely. A 2006 police report, which was obtained by In Touch before its destruction, indicates that family patriarch Jim Bob Duggar knew as early as 2002 that Josh Duggar -- who was 14 at the time -- was accused of sexually abusing an underage girl. The teen was ultimately accused of inappropriately touching five underage girls, some of whom were his sisters, between 2002 and 2003.Police did not find out about the allegations until 2006, when they were tipped off to a letter discussing the incidents, the AP reports. A family friend had lent another person a book, and the letter was stuck inside. The police report obtained by In Touch indicates Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar told police in 2006 that they had disciplined their son themselves.The couple allegedly said that they sent Josh Duggar to a “Christian program” that “consisted of physical hard work and counseling.” Michelle Duggar later admitted that they actually just sent him to live with a family friend to help with a home remodeling business, according to In Touch. Both Josh Duggar, now 27, and his parents acknowledged the incidents and publicly apologized in Facebook posts on Thursday. TLC pulled all airings of “19 Kids and Counting” from its lineup the day after Duggar admitted the allegations were true.Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee voiced his support for the judge’s decision to destroy the records in a Facebook post Friday. “There was no consideration of the fact that the victims wanted this to be left in the past and ultimately a judge had the information on file destroyed -- not to protect Josh, but the innocent victims,” Huckabee wrote. The Duggar family has “a long and active history of political advocacy for social conservative causes,” CNN noted. Josh Duggar resigned from his position at the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group and lobbying organization, on Thursday. According to the AP, Duggar was previously “a public face” of the group.  Contact The Author"

Residents said he was killed near his home.Burundi is facing its deepest crisis since the end of an ethnically fueled civil war in 2005. The unrest was triggered by the president's decision to seek another five years in office.Opponents, such as Feruzi, have said it is unconstitutional.The president has shown no sign of backing down, pointing to a constitutional court ruling that said he can run again because his first term, when he was picked by parliament not elected in a popular vote, did not count.The crisis has already prompted a failed coup and driven more than 110,000 people to flee to neighboring states for fear the violence will spread beyond the capital. It has unnerved a region that has a history of ethnic conflict.""We heard a lot of gunfire,"" a neighbor of Feruzi told Reuters Television. ""It's unfortunate because there were army soldiers here, and they didn't do anything.""Feruzi, a member of the African nation's relatively small Muslim community, was a well-known figure although his party was not among the nation's biggest. Burundi has dozens of registered parties.A Reuters photographer took a picture of a man with a fatal bullet wound to the head and other injuries who locals said was Feruzi.Ngagara district has been one of the hotbeds of unrest during protests that have taken place almost daily since Nkurunziza announced his re-election bid on April 25.The presidential election is due to be held on June 26. Parliamentary and local council polls will now be held on June 5, delayed by a little more than week.After the shooting, residents in that area of Ngagara swiftly set up make-shift barricades on the streets for protection, an increasingly common sight throughout even quiet neighborhoods of the capital.Police have fired teargas, water cannon and even guns at protesters, who have hurled rocks back. The Red Cross says they have seen about 20 killed in the unrest so far, but emergency workers say the total is probably much higher.Police say they have not shot at demonstrators. The government has branded the protests an ""insurrection.""Until Saturday's shooting, the day had been relatively quiet with few protesters on the streets, following a pattern where weekends have tended to be calmer. But the opposition has vowed to keep on protesting until Nkurunziza ends his re-election bid.(Additioal reporting by Goran Tomasevic; Writing by Edmund Blair; Editing by Alison Williams)"

The film follows him as he takes care first of one patient (until the funeral), and then another -- and then another -- each time scrupulously washing the patient's back, with dedicated strokes, or encouraging him or her to speak about their lives. The nurse even goes so far as to buy an architecture book for one of his crotchety patients (an architect), and to visit one of the homes he designed. What is odd is that his care for his patients is absolutely deadpan -- and he, for an unfathomable reason, deeply depressed.Tim Roth in person -- whom I saw joking at poolside with a hotel woman who called to him from her balcony -- is quite opposite from the role he plays. Lively, funny (""I love you too!"" he called up to the woman at the balcony) and jocular. In the film, he is brooding, with his body tensed up like that of a former high school wrestler, who never got out of the pose. At the press conference, in fact, the actor remarked that: ""For this role, I stripped myself bare. I played the nurse very quiet. I didn't want to distract from him, so I tried to keep myself low.""Chronic is a riveting film -- because of Roth -- and may very well win an award tomorrow night. But it is tough to watch, just as it is tough to be at the hospital bedside of a patient in chronic pain (one after another). There is no joy in the movie, and very little warmth. The other characters in the film (mostly family members of the patients) have little affect: Perhaps because they are dealing with a loved one's chronic illness (as the director noted at the press conference), but more likely because the director has chosen to put the spotlight on how estranged we human beings are from each other. The nurse, in his strange dense way, is the most ""human"" character. The others, in contrast, seem cold, rushed, or indifferent, and speak to each other in monotone. A sense of mystery is what propels the story: Something traumatic happened in this nurse's past that spurs him in his overzealous activity. The mystery works: We are gripped to the ""cold"" story before us, one that (plot spoiler) ends up as icy as it begins.I went to meet the young Mexican director, Michel Franco, to ask him why he created such a disturbingly bleak universe.Why did you make a film in which humans seem not to care about each other? Is this how you see people?I should not be very pessimistic as in my personal life I am lucky with my friends and family. My family came all the way from Mexico to be here with me. Nevertheless, I am intrigued by how we can be well-educated and civilized, and still have trouble communicating. Humans are complicated; we always make mistakes with each other. It is the same pessimistic view that you will find in my other films.   Almost all of the relationships in the film are cold, except for the one at the end, with Tim Roth and the cancer patient ""Martha."" Can you comment on Martha?Oh yes, Martha. It's true they end up being close. Still, I don't know if Martha is manipulating him. We don't know if from the very beginning, she is trying to manipulate him.Really! I didn't see her this way.It's not clear. I will have to see it again and tell you what I think of Martha. Every time I see the film I think differently about Martha. I am suspicious of people's motives. We all have our worries, and our minds are complicated, and even if we love each other, we harm each other... Some viewers will be disappointed that this film has no arc of triumph, no evolution. In a conventional film, a protagonist who begins a film depressed will evolve and, by film's end, have a surprising realization or recovery. My film is close to real life, in that life rarely has that arc where everything changes and is better at the end. I like movies that do not solve the conflict, because when the conflict is solved, it satisfies the spectator and all is finished, forgotten in an hour. But if the conflict is not solved, like in my film, you are forced to keep thinking about it. Usually in a film, the audience is told from the beginning: Be prepared for the final [triumphant] end. I just shot my film in a way I like: subtle. I don't give things to the audience. I feel like the audience is tired with being disrespected. You say life has no arcs. Do you really believe that?When my professional life is going well, I am happy, and then I am down again. Yes, I have those kinds of professional arcs.  What about non-professional arcs? How about going through an emotional upset or loss, and then changing through it, or achieving some kind of resolution? This is a way many people approach tragedies... I would say no, that does not happen. Most things you have to accept them and move on, if they are really bad. You don't change them and it is better to accept and move on. These people who believe in change are in therapy for ten years or always reading a book about how to be happy, but then they fall into another problem. I am more simple. As long as there is no trouble in my life, I focus on work. I am going to guess that you are an atheist: and think there is nothing after death.Right. I do think there is nothing after life. Death is scary. It is a horrible thought, pessimistic, but it is good to embrace that thought because if you accept it, it makes you make the most of your life. One critique of your film: The father/daughter relationship is not quite believable. The Tim Roth character sees his daughter after many years of absence, and she just casually welcomes him back with a, ""Nice to see you!""True, but I wanted to make the father-daughter story as small as possible. With the daughter, I just wanted to make a point that the nurse is welcomed back easily by his [estranged] family, so even that cannot explain his depression. The real problem for him is that he cannot cope with life; it's not a matter of external factors. Where did you get the idea for your story?My grandmother got sick in 2010, and she was tied to a bed for several months before she passed away. I was very moved by the angel who took care of her. I asked this nurse, Beatrice, how many years she had been doing this! The work kept her down. She was depressed. Yet, she said she liked her work. She was always thinking about her patients. Nurses are close to certain matters that we try to escape; they are brave and they do it. My film is a character study. The reason I chose to make it a male nurse is because of Tim Roth. I won the Certain Regard with my film After Lucia a couple years ago [2012]. Tim Roth was on the jury. He came up to me after the awards ceremony and said, ""Let's work together!"" I told him I was making a film about a nurse and he said, ""If you make her a male, I'll be that nurse!""

Perhaps put in the mood by starring in a show with such heavy gay themes, Fonda has been chatting nonstop about queer topics while doing press for the series.She recently told Pride Source's Chris Azzopardi that one of her favorite memories was ""campaigning with Harvey Milk in the Castro District in San Francisco"" and that a very famous unnamed gay actor once asked her to marry him.And in the newest issue of W magazine, Fonda opened up about another one of Hollywood's biggest stars -- Warren Beatty -- and said that she once mistakenly thought that he was gay.Noting their 1959 screen test for the film ""Parrish,"" W revealed that Beatty ""recalled that they 'were thrown together like two lions in a cage and kissed until we had practically eaten each others’ heads off.'""In response, Fonda told the magazine she ""didn't remember the test at all"" and jokingly added, ""I thought Warren was gay. He played piano, and all his friends were gay.”The friends Fonda referred to were possibly gay playwrights William Inge and Tennessee Williams, Queerty noted.Beatty has dated his fair share of leading women, including Madonna and Annette Bening, to whom the actor has been married since 1992. In 2010, an unauthorized biography claimed that he had slept with close to 13,000 women, a number the actor's rep called ""baloney.""Read the full interview with Fonda by heading to W. "

Pohorille advised by email that he was traveling to the city, giving two weeks' notice, and suggested we meet to discuss origin of life. I proposed meeting at the Simons Foundation exoplanet tea and lecture followed by a drink. He preferred a more private situation, dinner perhaps. We settled on cocktails at Bemelmans.I was flattered that he chose to interrupt his personal holiday for a meeting with me, but was naturally curious why. Pohorille said he was not looking for a ""man-bites-dog"" story, which he terms all news stories. But I ultimately decided the encounter was of public interest.Andrew's wife Joanna joined us for drinks. She agreed with her husband about an elusive X-factor to life. Joanna is a cognitive psychologist specializing in risk-taking analysis, behavioral economics. The two have written a couple of papers together on the subject. Both Andrew and Joanna are natives of Poland. Andrew came to the US as a child at age six and has retained his charming accent. Joanna left Poland when the two married 18 years ago.

We first met at the 2013 Princeton Origins of Life conference co-sponsored by NASA, where I discovered him alone, at the coffee station, having escaped from the lecture hall. Pohorille is not an RNA world enthusiast and the Princeton presentations were largely all about RNA. He told me at Bemelmans that he never thought I'd follow through with a book on origin of life.Pohorille is now even less enthused about the RNA world since Princeton and said there were also fewer scientists currently pursuing that line of research. He also thinks the answer to origin of life is not about a thermodynamic factor -- which he says smacks of creationism. And he adds that scientists have so far not found viruses in meteorites, i.e., no nucleic acid. I mentioned the recent lukewarm New York Times story about origin of life research and Pohorille agreed not only with the Times assessment but with comments made earlier to me by biochemist Pier Luigi Luisi that we need all new ""mindstorms,"" because nothing much has happened since Miller-Urey yet scientists keep pursuing the same lines of investigation. Pohorille, however, does think working with amino acids makes sense. His personal view is that the way forward is somewhere between Steve Benner's research and Jack Szostak's.

11,POLITICS,Conscious Politics: Hillary at the Helm,"Therese Rowley, Ph.D., ContributorIntuitive Business Consultant and Intuitive Reader",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conscious-politics-hillar_b_7410502.html,I was struck by how accessible she seemed.

When reminded of her rich experience on Capitol Hill, as she told stories of working directly with Vladimir Putin and other world leaders, I was struck by how accessible she seemed. The veneer I am so accustomed to encountering in politicians was entirely missing.Hillary said she really does listen to people across the country and I believed her. One challenge she has prioritized based on what she has heard is the need to help communities at all economic levels stop the spread of drug use by youth. She said the number of suicides associated with this trend is heartbreaking. Another cause Hillary highlighted was how those who need mental health care are turning to more expensive and inappropriate alternatives such as hospital emergency rooms or even jail because they have nowhere else to go.Courageously, Hillary also said she was committed to stopping billionaires from anonymously running political campaigns through PACs... as she spoke from the winding staircase of billionaire J.B. Pritzker's Chicago mansion! (He seemed graciously unoffended by the comment) She has been a senator, a First Lady, a Secretary of State. And yet, she was speaking most like a mother who wanted a better future for her children and grandchildren. (Hillary told us that Charlotte, her eight-month-old granddaughter's first words to her would be ""stop reading to me!"" Knowing the statistics on reading and school preparedness, Hillary has been reading to Charlotte incessantly since birth.) As I listened, I was reminded of the Native Americans who had a Council of Grandmothers held in such high esteem that the tribe would not go to war without the Grandmothers' consent. The Grandmothers' approval rested on their assessment of how an act of war would impact seven generations hence. Will this country be in better hands through the sensibility of a woman and a grandmother...who also happens to be the most qualified presidential candidate on the planet?When I shook her hand and talked with her briefly, I felt the same way I do when I interview conscious business leaders - Hillary speaks authentically, to and through her values. I believe it is time for the U.S. to be led through the lens of this highly qualified, accessible, educated, experienced woman. Go Hillary!"

James McGreevey, center, speaks to a gathering of women inmates at Integrity House, a transitional housing/residential treatment area for women incarcerated at the Hudson County Correctional Center, in Kearney, N.J. Seven years after coming out as the nation's first openly gay governor and resigning over an affair with a male staffer, McGreevey 54, is the spiritual counselor to 40 women inmates at the North Jersey facility, who have been locked up for crimes ranging from manslaughter and gun possession to drug dealing. (AP Photo/Mel Evans)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b8512400005100562895.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shows like ""Orange Is the New Black"" (OITNB) and investigative documentaries like Diane Sawyer's ""A Nation of Women Behind Bars"" highlight life in lockdown and have opened up a national conversation about the lives and treatment of female prisoners.Reality vs. TV When it comes to portraying women in prison, television either heightens the reality as seen in ""OITNB"" and Australia's dark drama ""Wentworth,"" or takes us behind the concrete walls and barbed-wire fences to see the real faces of female prisoners in America. Both approaches serve a purpose, which is to humanize incarcerated women and help us understand how these women are more than criminals -- they are mothers, daughters, sisters, wives and best friends. In the alternate reality of Danbury Prison, where ""OITNB"" takes place, life behind bars is often portrayed as a strict summer camp where friendships are made, alliances are formed, and sing-alongs and dance parties help break up the monotony. Other times we are led down the darker corridors of prison life: assault, abuse of power, paralyzing fear and desperate loneliness. ""In a nation whose justice system often offers little more than one-size-fits-all injustice, a television series that inspires viewers to see convicts as fellow human beings can help us better understand and perhaps have a bit more empathy toward them,"" The Washington Post reported. ""We should not confuse a TV program with a criminology course, but 'Orange is the New Black' goes a long way toward narrowing the gap between our perceptions of convicts and the sometimes surprising reality.""The groundbreaking show, based on the real experiences of Piper Kerman, garnered both praise and criticism. Praise for making the reality of women behind bars a national conversation, and criticism for glamorizing or sugar-coating the experiences from which other former prisoners are still trying to recover.  One real inmate from Danbury wrote, ""The Netflix series 'Orange is the New Black' isn't funny to the women who served time in Danbury Federal Prison. I know because I am one of those women."" Balancing the public perception is a selection of reality docu-series that take a long, hard look at real women serving out real sentences in real time. TLC aired several specials that explore different issues faced by female prisoners. ""Babies Behind Bars"" looked at prisoners taking childcare classes in preparation to one day take care of the children they gave birth to in prison. ""Breaking Down the Bars"" is a series helmed by Oprah's OWN network and, in addition to daily prison life, this show focuses on therapy and rehabilitation. Producers even brought their own clinical psychologist to work with inmates.Most recently, FOX's hit ""Empire"" has joined the ranks of shows portraying the impact of prison on American women. The show's matriarch, Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) may be the powerhouse that brought her family to fame and fortune, but that luxury was hard-won on the back of her time in prison. ""While many may be wrapped up in the cosmic mix of glamour and OG attitude that is Cookie, her background provides the character with a depth and complexity that still lacks from portrayals of black women on TV,"" according to the analysis of Henson's character done by For Harriet.  ""Cookie represents the substantial number of black mothers who are separated from their children while serving prison sentences.""Hope for the Hopeless Cookie's character highlights the impact of incarceration on mothers and the children they must leave behind while incarcerated--an issue that is reaching epidemic proportions. Not only does America currently have over 200,000 women serving sentences, but it is the largest female prisoner population on earth. Of those, approximately 56 percent report being parents. There are also two African-American women behind bars for every white female inmate.""There are now 200,000 women in prison or jail in the United States, a figure that represents an increase of over 750% in the last three decades, and nearly twice the rate of increase that men experienced,"" according to the Women's Prison Association. ""As is the case with men, incarceration rates for women also reflect tremendous racial disparities; one out of every 100 black women in the U.S. is now incarcerated, nearly three times the rate for women overall.""Not only do shows like ""OITNB"" and ""Empire"" make female prisoners real to us, but they also highlight the additional societal issues that contribute to the epidemic of women behind bars in America. Economic status, race, and education remain factors for criminal activity and subsequent incarceration. In an age when we often congratulate ourselves on how far we've come, it's important to be reminded that our enlightenment as a nation has not yet come to fruition. Both the numbers and the images of women behind bars can feel overwhelming and discouraging. However, the impact of media and audience interest in the plight of female prisoners is shedding a light on issues that may not otherwise be addressed. While there are certainly creative liberties taken in ""OITNB,"" several real issues have been explored--from the perpetuation of guards using their power and influence to trade favors for sex to the rights of transgender inmates to receive prescribed hormone therapy while incarcerated. The more we are exposed to the realities of life for female prisoners, the more we will be mobilized to work for fair treatment, reasonable sentencing, and support for both prisoners and their families. If you've been inspired to make a difference for women prisoners there are a variety of ways to become involved, including work with at-risk girls and women who may be able to avoid a life behind bars.Working as a tutor or mentor with at-risk girls or young women who have just become involved in the court system can help make an impact before it's too late. Check with state organizations to find out how you can become involved in building self-esteem, cultivating social skills and improving educational performance. The Women's Prison Association also offers a multitude of volunteer options that range from community involvement to active work with female prisoners and parolees.Thanks to recent television exposure, the national conversation about women in prison is louder and more active than ever before. While America is undeniably facing a challenge when it comes to the proliferation of female prisoners, there is hope that we will mobilize as a nation to curb the tide. Television may not be the answer, but it is certainly a catalyst for awareness, activism, and change."

Emancipate UT.""  The first half of the phrase refers to a successful campaign at the University of Cape Town (South Africa) to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes, a wealthy British businessman, but also one of the founders of the Apartheid state. Throughout the years, debate has engulfed UT's statue collection, a symbol of the University's racist past, and an embodiment of its continuing difficulties in creating a welcoming campus to students of color. According to the Atlanta Black Star, descendants of Confederate soldiers believe they should be able to erect statues to honor fallen soldiers and even more moderate historians at UT have proposed contextualizing the construction of the whole memorial, ostensibly praising national unity after the Civil War, with commemorative plaques. The Fort-Worth Star Telegram's Bob Ray Sanders argues Davis' humility after the Civil War gives him redeeming value. UT's student government has voted asking the administration to remove the statue.What is the intent of the statues? To honor an ignoble part of our history, or merely the Civil War's fallen?To answer these questions, readers must look past the Littlefield Fountain, that famous statue of WWI triumphalism, to a little-read but prominent inscription on the memorial's left wall: Photo of Littlefield Fountain taken from Wikipedia Commons Photo of inscription taken by author May 11, 2015To the men and women of the Confederacy, who fought with valor and suffered with fortitude, that States Rights be maintained, and who not dismayed by defeat nor discouraged by misrule, builded [sic.] from the ruins of a devastating war a greater South. And to the men and women of the nation who gave of their possessions and of their lives, that free government be made secure to the peoples of the Earth, this memorial is dedicated.This dedication ought to raise important questions on the part of young students who unload from buses, welcomed to UT's campus by Little Field Fountain on tour weekends. An inscription that both honors those ""not...discouraged by misrule"" by a union simultaneously praises ""the men and women of the nation"" who sacrificed their lives to preserve democratic governance in the First World War. This inscription is a contradictory and erroneous attempt to conflate the freedom defended overseas, with the ""state autonomy"" that maintained slavery, and later, Jim Crow, at home.  When I talked to UT English Professor Coleman Hutchison, who focuses on American Southern literature, he argued the continued dedication to the Confederacy amid an array of options as a conscious (and unfortunate) choice. Referring to Texas' time as a Lone Star Republic, Coleman emphasized that secession was not a ""one time gamble"" in Texas like in the rest of the South. He observed that Texas, unlike its other Southern counterparts, has a ""six-flag ethos"" that allows it to toss ideas like secession around without immediately tying such positions to slavery.Hutchison pointed out that the statues came along at a time when the South was looking both to prove itself as a patriotic force in a post-WWI nation, and trying to preserve and enhance feelings of Southern pride. From Hutchison's point of view, this tension stems from the Confederacy's Civil War status as not just an internal rebellion, but a state in its own right that considered itself to be fighting a second War of Independence.The University's complacency on the Jefferson Davis statue in particular may reflect an unwillingness to deal with racial tensions officials could see as one more divisive issue causing problems for their funding base and their business model: A model stretching back to ideas about a competitive and industrialized South. Littlefield and James S. Hogg, a populist Texas governor, emphasized a rejection of Old South agrarian economic models in favor of New South modernization. Although the New South system believed ""racial harmony"" contributed to this advance, it still rested on the inferiority of the black community. This heritage causes problems for UT's diversity mission. According to the University of Texas' statistical handbook, only 3.8 percent of the university's population come from African-American communities, down from 4 percent in 2013-2014. In the university's vaunted business model however, New South names still hold sway (an Endowed Presidential Scholarship is named after Alice Duggan Gracy, a Littlefield descendant. One of the main auditoriums on campus as well as a Social Work foundation, are named for Hogg). ""The entire iconic view [from the South Mall] of the university is punctuated by an embrace of its Confederate past."" says Hutchison. However, given the University already downplays its Southern connections, he fears that removing the statues entirely would inadvertently close a natural gateway to discussing UT's residual racial issues, both historic and present, with reticent students. He argues that education about the statues and discussion about racial issues on campus should be mandatory for future students. Proponents of the University more generally point out its advocacy before the Supreme Court on affirmative action, statues of Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, Martin Luther King, and Cesar Chavez, in an attempt to show that the university is balanced. Debates over Federalism and Southern exceptionalism aren't merely historical. Readers may recall that Greg Abbott, our governor, deployed state troops late last month in response to fears of a national invasion of Texas by the United States' first African-American President. Perhaps readers recall recent bungled attempts by the Texas Legislature to pass a preemptive law that would prohibit the enactment of any favorable Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage, echoing segregation fights of old. Stale ""states' rights"" rhetoric and tendencies to fear ""misrule"" are well and alive in Texas. That large inscription passed by thousands of students a day does not just remember, but endorses, those tendencies. Instead of promoting these outdated values, the University should vigorously reeducate its students, if not by removing the statues, at least rededicating them in a way as to tell the story of the tragedy of needless blood spilled, not of a ""glorious past"" that existed only in the minds of those who refused to let go."
14,TRAVEL,"The Best Way To Travel Through Asia? On A Scooter, Of Course","Clarissa Ferreira, ContributorScreenwriter, photographer and creator of the web series “Blam...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scootering-through-asia-i_b_7409440.html,"When in Asia, do what the locals do: get on a motorbike and hit the road. Here are some suggestions of destinations you can hit up on your next vacation!",2015-05-22,2015-05-15-1431687186-9003298-PADANG_meninaestrada.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-15-1431687186-9003298-PADANG_meninaestrada-thumb.jpg," Scooter, Vespa, motorbike, moped. Call them what you will -- those machines are wildly common in the cities of Asia. Because they are cheap, light and easy to ride, they dominate traffic around here, and have become very popular among travelers. But is traveling this area of the world on a scooter only for the bold?  Over two and a half years traveling around Asia, I've found just the opposite. For starters, renting a bike is a very easy thing. Driver's license? You often don't need to present one. Insurance and deposit payments are rarely asked for. Gasoline? You can buy it for a song. Rent? A bargain. Besides the low cost, scooters are an excellent means to explore cities, villages, fields and beaches, since you're free to choose your own way and reach places otherwise hard to access. One day on a little bike is a guarantee of totally unpredictable experiences that will become the most special memories of your trip. So, when in Asia, do what the locals do: get on a motorbike and hit the road. Here are some suggestions of destinations you can hit up on your next vacation!  1) YOGYAKARTA, INDONESIAMany people who go to Yogyakarta go specifically to watch the sunrise in Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument in the world. But Yogyakarta is much more than Borobudur.The city's surroundings are a perfect slice of Indonesia: endless rice fields, tiny villages, and a dizzying entanglement of little roads, ready to be explored by you, your scooter and nobody else. You can also visit the famous Hindu temple Prambanan, crossing the little town of Kaliurang at the foot of the Merapi volcano. Can you picture that? Well, it's better than you can imagine! Apart from a brief patch of chaotic traffic at the town's exit, the rest of the road is pure peace that you won't soon forget.  2) LUANG PRABANG, LAOSWalking around the charming streets of Luang Prabang, you will be approached by travel agents offering package tours to take you to the waterfalls, the elephant fields or for a trip to the river. Say thank you, walk away -- and go on into the first shop that has a scooter to rent and a good map to sell.Going solo is much more fun -- you can take your time and go to Kuang Si and Tad Sae, two splendid waterfalls with turquoise water. The road is in good condition and cuts through forests and mountains, offering you astonishing landscapes along the way (and a lot of shade!). With a bit of luck, you will have the chance to give a ride to the kids walking back from school at the end of the day.3) CHIANG MAI, THAILAND Chiang Mai is right in the middle of the highest mountains of Thailand, so it's no surprise that the city's surroundings display exuberant natural beauty. Forests, strawberry fields, rivers and a lot of ecotourism (WATCH!) are all around you. Another good option is to climb 9 miles up the mountain to visit the holy temple of Wat Phra That, one of the most famous and revered in the city. Whatever your route is, be sure to expect intense traffic on the way back to the city, especially at the end of the day. If you don't dare to face the road, relax. Visiting the historical centre of Chiang Mai on a scooter is really easy. Stay in that part of the city and enjoy the many Buddhist temples built during the city's foundation, over 700 years ago. If the heat gets tough (and it will), stop to eat a delicious pad thai before moving on to the next temple.  4) MANINJAU LAKE, SUMATRA (INDONESIA)In just a few hours, it's possible to tour the whole of Maninjau, the huge lake formed by a volcano crater in Sumatra, Indonesia. If you have never ventured out on a scooter, this is a great place to start. Around the lake, there's nothing but small fishermen's villages, rice fields, schools and mosques, and the road is never busy. Get ready to see abundant smiles and curious faces -- foreign tourists are a rarity there. Charge your GoPro and get the most beautiful images of your trip (if you doubt that, check out some gorgeous images here)!5) HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM Traffic in Vietnam is a tourist attraction in and of itself. The hordes of motorbikes, the deafening sound of horns and the pedestrians' calm as they walk through the madness are vivid memories for those who visit cities such as Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. So how did Vietnam get on this list? I'll explain:Although I would not recommend riding your own bike around town, you can easily find a ""mototaxi"" and climb on the back -- it's cheap, safe and fun. In addition, some agencies offer Vespa tours to visit street fairs, bars and restaurants all through the night. It's a fantastic way to explore less touristy neighbourhoods and taste the local cuisine in great company.  6) KOH LANTA, THAILAND Koh Lanta is one of my favourite islands in Thailand. Underestimated and little visited by many foreigners -- who prefer the famous and posh Phi Phi and Phuket -- Lanta is the ideal place for you to venture on your first scooter rides. The island, just 16 miles long, has a very laid back vibe, which is reflected in the people, the landscape and the traffic. The streets are paved, safe and not very busy. You can spend the day hopping from heavenly beach to heavenly beach or visit the scenic Old Town, the older part of the island that's filled with traditional houses at the edge of the sea, charming cafes and abundant peace.  But wherever you may roam, here's a reminder:Traffic in Asia is not a piece of cake. In addition, local motorists drive in a way that seems to make sense for them, but tourists are definitely not used to it. Avoid very busy roads and check the road conditions. If you do not feel safe riding a scooter, DO NOT RIDE ONE. Find other means of transport or tag along with someone who's more experienced. Avoid rush hours and night tours. And it's always good to repeat the obvious: DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL OR USE DRUGS when riding!  Now go pack, grab your helmet and have a nice trip!This piece was originally published on HuffPost Brazil and was translated into English."

After graduation, I enrolled in Moscow State University where I studied for just over a year until emigrating (yet again) to the United States.

The European Broadcast Union banned the entry, as it violated the spirit of the ESC to foster peace and dialogue through music, urging the Georgian composers to either rewrite the lyrics or drop out completely. The Georgian delegation chose the latter.After careful consideration, I proposed to the Georgian Public Broadcaster to use a ""double-entendre"" technique; that is, to embed and relay the same message but in a form of a love song, which would have had been more in the spirit of the pop song contest. Following my submission of ""Never Give In,"" which was included in the pre-selection concert and performed on GPB's Channel 1 by a Georgian artist, Sofia Nizharadze, the Georgian officials voiced their verdict: the lyrical content of the song was considered ""insufficiently political for the cause."" Though undeniably disappointed, deep down, I was also secretly relieved. Had ""Never Give In"" reached the finals in its semi-political form, I, as the guilt-ridden creator of its content, may have found myself on the receiving end of repercussions from my surrogate home, Russia. Instead, GPB picked a power ballad, ""Shine,"" devoid of any political undertones composed by a Norwegian songwriter, Hanne Sørvaag (the 2010 ESC was being hosted in Norway). Though seemingly more in line with the Eurovision format, viewers of Georgian National TV Channel 1 complained that picking the Norwegian song was an unpatriotic misrepresentation of Georgian culture.Ultimately, we cannot ignore the founding mission of Eurovision to showcase the importance of bringing countries together -- not breaking them apart -- to celebrate diversity, music and culture, instead of criticizing each other's political leaders and burning bridges with next-door neighbors.

Central to the GOP-led committee’s investigation is the trove of Clinton’s private emails sent while she was secretary of state. The New York Times reported in March that Clinton used a private email server to conduct government business, violating State Department and White House rules.The State Department has begun to release the contents of the emails, some of which were obtained by the Times. On Tuesday, the Times reported that Blumenthal had sent at least 25 memos to Clinton while she was secretary of state. At the time, Blumenthal was working for the Clinton Foundation, and some of the information in the memos may have been obtained from American contractors with whom he was doing business in Libya.Blumenthal on Thursday said that his reports “came from sources I considered reliable” and that he sent them in his capacity “as a private citizen and friend.”""From time to time, as a private citizen and friend, I provided Secretary Clinton with material on a variety of topics that I thought she might find interesting and helpful,” he said.When asked by reporters on Tuesday about Blumenthal’s role, Clinton, a candidate for president in 2016, minimized the concerns. “He's been a friend of mine for a long time,"" she said. ""I'm going to keep talking to my old friends, whoever they are.""Clinton has urged the State Department to release the emails “as quickly as they possibly can.” The department had planned to release them all in January, citing the volume and sensitivity of the information.

Almost.While the pontiff is building bridges to Communists in Cuba, nuns who had been under suspicion, Muslims, Jews, Protestants and even people outside the faith, two dissenting groups stand out: Catholics on the Left, in whose eyes he is not moving fast enough with respect to church laws, policies, and theology to effect the changes which they regard as urgent, and Catholics on the Right, who are displeased by almost everything this pope says and does.So predictable are his critics on the Right that we seldom engage in sighting them or commenting on them in Sightings. But never to notice them does a disservice to those who would like a full accounting of the Pope-in-public, the Pontiff-in-the media, etc.So, to remind ourselves that the Rightists are out there, let's just for once focus on a sample, in order to transmit a bit of the flavor and tone of what they have to say.Out of many choices, let's notice, as representative, Cliff Kincaid (see ""Sources.""). He directs the Accuracy in Media's AIM Center for Investigative Journalism. The Southern Poverty Law Center people (see ""Sources"") list a few score of his victims, a.k.a. subjects.Kincaid's blog last Friday is headlined ""The Catholic Church Has Gone Socialist."" He writes that it is dawning ""on many in and out of the media that Pope Francis has come down on the side of the 'progressive,' and even Marxist, forces in the world today."" He quotes his spiritual kin Stephen Herreid on this ""new Catholic scandal"" which is ""as significant and terrifying as the presence of pedophiles in the church.""The Pope--this is Kincaid again--""has made common cause with the forces of international Marxism, which are associated with atheism, the suppression of traditional Christianity and the persecution and murder of Christians,"" so ""[c]onservative Catholics and many other are terrified of what is to come.""Kincaid also quotes Timothy Ball, author of The Deliberate Corruption of Climate Science, who argued in an interview that ""the Catholic Church is regretting making him the pope"" after ""the powerful Cardinals pushed"" Pope Benedict ""aside."" From this ""Right"" angle, Pope Francis is seen as too friendly to ""Liberation Theology"" heroes; he ""even"" greeted Gustavo Gutierrez as an official guest of the Vatican.Kincaid cites with favor the late Malachi Martin, discredited everywhere but on the Catholic Far Right, who had written critically that ""the most powerful religious orders of the Roman Church...all committed themselves to Liberation Theology."" Also in the figurative gunsights on the right are Francis-favored advocates of ""sustainable development:"" ""The pope's left-wing supporters at the Catholic Climate Covenant are ecstatic over [the pope's] upcoming encyclical on ecology and climate change.""  Let the Southern Poverty Law people take over from here in reporting. They remembered Kincaid applauding a proposed law in Uganda which would impose the death penalty on large numbers of gay men.They also remembered Kincaid buttressing his anti-gay approach by reference to a book by James Wanliss, who argues that the environmental movement ""is a religion with a vision of sin and repentance, heaven and hell, Its communion is organic food. Its sacraments are sex, abortion, and when all else fails, sterilization.... Both professing Protestants and Roman Catholics bear a burden of guilt for the current political mess we are in with the global warming and other hysterias.""Get ready for more of these attacks from the edges of the crowd when the pope visits the United States or issues his encyclical.

A broken onshore pipeline spewed oil down a storm drain and into the ocean for several hours Tuesday before it was shut off, creating a slick some 4 miles long about 20 miles west of Santa Barbara. (AP Photo/Michael A. Mariant)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb16adc2000009900ffa3d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While the damage from the oil pipeline rupture on the California coastline is still unfolding, already its toll is daunting. Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a State of Emergency in Santa Barbara County. An estimated 105,000 gallons spilled from the burst pipeline in all, about a fifth of which made it into the sea. An oil slick 9 miles long has marred the state's natural coastline. Refugio Beach, a popular state park and campground that had been booked solid for the holiday weekend, is now closed indefinitely. Scientists have begun the grim task of assessing the impact on wildlife, counting up dead sea turtles and oil-soaked birds.The Santa Barbara County spill, one of the largest in California history, reiterates what we already know: We can't extract oil and transport it without putting our beaches, wildlife, and coastal communities at risk. The sad fact is, when you drill, you spill.Californians learned this lesson early on, the hard way. The infamous Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969 spewed an estimated 3 million gallons of crude oil into the ocean, creating an oil slick 35 miles long and killing thousands of birds, fish and sea mammals. The tragedy spurred outraged citizens and conservationists to action, launching the modern environmental movement.But from coast to coast, it seems we are still fighting the same fight we fought more than 45 years ago. Oil companies and elected officials pledge to protect our coastline with more safety measures, yet promote exposing more of our prized beaches to the risks of oil and gas extraction.While California has long since banned new drilling off its coast, Wednesday's spill shows how existing oil and gas infrastructure still poses threats onshore and off. Meanwhile, drilling rigs in place before the 1969 blowout are pursuing new damaging ways to extract oil and gas, including slant drilling and offshore fracking.In the Arctic Ocean, the Obama administration has already granted Shell conditional permission to drill. Harsh conditions in this fragile sea would make a spill nearly impossible to clean up, and threaten ice seals, beluga whales, and a fifth of the world's polar bear population.And on the southern Atlantic Coast, the president's Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management has proposed allowing oil and gas rigs as soon as 2017, putting at risk the shore where families and friends go to swim, ride the waves, collect seashells, and relax. From Assateague Island in Virginia where wild ponies roam, to the Outer Banks, to pristine barrier islands running all the way to the tip of Florida, these beaches are visited each year in the millions. Just like in California, a burst pipeline on the Atlantic could ruin the coastline for beachgoers and businesses and damage precious marine life.This Memorial Day weekend, as we kick off the start to beach season, we urge thorough cleanup of Refugio Beach; we ask the oil company who damaged it to be held accountable; and we work for the next beach to be saved. Join us as we urge President Obama to drop his plans to expose more of our beaches and oceans to the dangers of dirty drilling, and to double down on clean, renewable energy instead."

The new measure expands the law to include non-licensees who are forced to leave their homes during hurricanes, wildfires or other emergencies.Opponents of the bill said evacuations were already high-stress situations and that guns would make public shelters more dangerous. Supporters argued that guns left at home would be easy prey for looters during an evacuation.The 48-hour limit was added at the request of police agencies, who did not want to give unlicensed gun owners an open-ended time to carry concealed pistols.

With the line-up for this fall's schedule in place, many shows have diverse casts with black actors in the forefront, like NBC's 'People are Talking' and HBO's 'Brothers in Atlanta', just to name a few. The story doesn't end there. Black faces are represented not only in front of the camera, but behind the camera, as creators, writers, directors and executive producers, thus positively influencing the portrayal of black people in the media. It is always great to see successful shows championed by black creators and executives, which, unsurprisingly, does not happen often due to a lack of diversity behind the scenes. Shonda Rhimes said it best in her DGA Diversity Award acceptance speech: ""It's not because of a lack of talent. It's because of a lack of access. People hire who they know. If it's been a white boys club for 70 years, that's a lot of white boys hiring one another."" Fortunately for this generation, the internet has become a great resource to help break that cycle and provide a platform for young and in charge, diverse storytellers. Anyone can create their own work and upload it online for the world to see without having to fight their way into Hollywood's ""goo ole' boys club."" Take 'Broad City', for example - today many people know it as the fun, laugh-out-loud female show on Comedy Central, but what many do not know is that it began as a web series. The series creators and stars of the show, Illana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, started 'Broad City' as a series of day-in-the-life sketches on Youtube. With the support of Amy Poehler, they went on to develop the series for television. While the goal for many is to eventually produce a traditional television series, the web has increasingly become a place where people seek out great content. According to a study done by Adobe, TV viewing online grew by 388 percent in mid-2014, compared to the same time a year earlier. The entertainment industry as a whole has started to take notice, with Netflix, AOL and Yahoo! now creating original web series only available online. Youtube, however, is the original space to find raw, new talent and has created a platform for many of these new digital media masterpieces. Like many of you, I have ditched traditional television programming on several occasions to sit in front of my laptop and binge watch 'Awkward Black Girl'. (If you haven't seen an episode, you're missing out on life).One of my current favorite online series to watch is 'Downtown Girls'  - a hilarious, hipsteresque web series featuring black women both in front of and behind the camera. The show, starring Emebeit Beyene, Crystal Boyd, Chivonne Michelle and Chandra Russell, and written by Jessica Lamour, follows four girls post graduation as they struggle to make ends meet in NYC. After a wake up call from a college friend, played by High School Musical's Monique Coleman, they decide to get their act together by turning their apartment into a lucrative nightclub in an attempt to leave an imprint on NYC culture. The internet has forever changed how we watch television. Independently created web series have opened the door to a new generation of aspiring entertainers. Who knows, the next Shonda Rhimes may be lurking somewhere on YouTube. Either way, one thing is for sure - ""black"" is the new ""black"" when it comes to entertainment, and we're not going anywhere."

The end result resembles the scenario outlined in House-passed legislation. Friday is the last day the Senate is scheduled to be in session before parts of the Patriot Act expire on June 1. Lawmakers in the House, who overwhelmingly passed the USA Freedom Act last week, left for a Memorial Day recess on Thursday afternoon and indicated they will not comply with a Senate attempt to extend the Patriot Act -- even temporarily. But Burr said he suspects the House may be willing to approve his alternative, which adopts reforms included in the House legislation on a slower timeline.The deadlock between senators who want to extend the Patriot Act and those who want reforms leaves Burr and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) -- both ardent supporters of existing surveillance -- with limited options. They could allow a vote on the House bill, which they claim dangerously restricts spy agencies' ability to intercept terrorist communications. Or they could try to push a Senate vote to extend the Patriot Act, risking shutdown of the surveillance program if the House refused to pass the extension. The Senate is scheduled to vote on both options Friday, and Burr predicts both will fail. Senate supporters of the USA Freedom Act, which leaves in place several aspects of the Patriot Act, but revokes that government’s authority to collect and store bulk metadata from Americans’ phone records, concede they don’t yet have 60 votes to pass the bill. “But we’re building momentum,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), one of the few Senate Republican backers. “We’re getting more and more support. We’re getting closer to 60 every second.” Some Republicans who had been lukewarm to the bill have begun to view it as the best option. “I want something to pass,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). “I think that’s got the best chance of passing.”When asked if the reform bill was likely to pass, Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) made a snoring noise. “They’re just lurching back and forth right now,” he said. “But again, as I predicted to you before, when Friday rolls around, the spirit of reconciliation becomes more prevalent throughout the body.” While McCain prefers a Patriot Act reauthorization, his priority is preventing a lapse in the NSA's surveillance program. “If there has to be some negotiation, okay. We’ve got to avoid the whole thing being shut down. We can’t have that happen. That would be a dereliction of duty.” Gaining the support of surveillance hawks isn’t the only challenge to passing the USA Freedom Act. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of the biggest critics of the NSA’s bulk data collection program, opposes the bill because it doesn't do enough to rein in the intelligence agencies. Paul on Wednesday delivered a 10 1/2-hour speech against spying, much of it detailing the shortcomings of the House-passed bill. “I understand where Rand is coming from,” said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who joined Paul briefly on the Senate floor during the marathon speech. But Manchin said the House measure is an appropriate compromise. “It still allows us to chase the rabbit down the hole as they say, find out who’s the bad guy and who all is talking to bad people. But it doesn’t have the bulk,” Manchin said. “The bulk has been ruled on as being illegal. Why would we extend something that’s been ruled on as illegal?”Manchin was one of a handful of senators who visited the White House Thursday, where top presidential advisers briefed members on the surveillance program and asked for their support on the USA Freedom Act. “The only thing I can tell you is my feeling is that there will not be a lapse,” said Manchin, referring to the NSA’s surveillance program. “I don’t think anyone wants to take that risk.”  "

Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) introduced legislation that aims to encourage pharmaceutical manufacturers to take the necessary steps to allow ""routine-use contraceptives"" -- like the pill -- to be sold over the counter. Essentially, the companies need to obtain permission from the Food and Drug Administration. The proposed Allowing Greater Access to Safe and Effective Contraception Act would waive the FDA filing fee for such applications and put them at the top of the agency's priority list.“It’s time to allow women the ability to make their own decisions about safe, effective, and long-established methods of contraception,” Gardner said in a statement. “Most other drugs with such a long history of safe and routine use are available for purchase over the counter, and contraception should join them.”But the proposal also represents a GOP end run around the Affordable Care Act provision that requires most employers to cover the full range of contraception at no cost to women. Republicans have long opposed and even pledged to repeal that rule because they claim it violates the religious freedom rights of employers who are morally opposed to birth control. The mandatory contraception coverage under Obamacare applies only to birth control that requires a prescription. So if this bill resulted in various forms of routine-use contraception being sold over the counter, they would not have to be covered by insurance.Women's health advocates balked on Thursday, arguing that the proposed legislation would force women to pay out of pocket for birth control and effectively limit their options. Birth control can cost women up to $600 a year, according to Planned Parenthood. “Planned Parenthood supports expanding access to birth control, which means making it available over-the-counter and also requiring it to be covered by insurance, so that it is affordable for all women,"" said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. ""The politicians who introduced this sham bill have repeatedly voted to take away insurance coverage and deny women access to birth control. They aren’t interested in expanding women’s access to birth control, and their bill would actually restrict women’s choices and cost women more money.”The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a non-profit organization of women's health doctors, said it opposes the Republicans' birth control bill. “The Affordable Care Act removed many barriers to preventive care that keeps women healthy,"" said ACOG President Mark S. DeFrancesco, M.D., in a statement. ""By making contraceptives available to women without a co-pay, it has truly increased access to contraception, thereby decreasing unintended pregnancies, and allowing women to better plan their futures. Unfortunately, instead of improving access, this bill would actually make more women have to pay for their birth control, and for some women, the cost would be prohibitive.""“As women’s health care providers, we welcome robust and productive dialogue about the indisputable role that contraceptives play in the health, well-being, and productivity of American women. We would welcome any legislation that would do what this proposal purports to do – help women. As it stands, however, we cannot support a plan that creates one route to access at the expense of another, more helpful route,” he said.This story has been updated with a statement from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists."

Josh's parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar also addressed the allegations on Facebook on Thursday: Back 12 years ago our family went through one of the most difficult times of our lives. When Josh was a young teenager, he made some very bad mistakes and we were shocked. We had tried to teach him right from wrong. That dark and difficult time caused us to seek God like never before. Even though we would never choose to go through something so terrible, each one of our family members drew closer to God. We pray that as people watch our lives they see that we are not a perfect family. We have challenges and struggles everyday. It is one of the reasons we treasure our faith so much because God’s kindness and goodness and forgiveness are extended to us — even though we are so undeserving. We hope somehow the story of our journey — the good times and the difficult times — cause you to see the kindness of God and learn that He can bring you through anything.The Duggar family has starred on TLC's ""19 Kids and Counting"" for 10 seasons. TLC has not responded to request for comment at this time.  "

It seems that as of late that my girlfriends and I have had many conversations about marriage, not necessarily beating our husbands up (ok, maybe just a little) but more about how much effort it really takes to stay connected. It seems that in the working, chauffeuring, cooking, cleaning, homework, iPhone checking, bill-paying, calendar organizing over-scheduledness of life that it's pretty easy to take your spouse for granted. It becomes a vicious cycle of husband or wife not feeling appreciated. For those with kids, it's easy to let the kids take priority and to forget about your significant other. Before you know it you're both facing opposite directions in bed not speaking to one another. We've been there! I get really truly bothered when my hubby and I are both clearly unhappy and there is this glum feeling that hangs over my day even when he's not around. I don't want just a ho-hum relationship, I want an extraordinary relationship! One where we're on the same side when life is handing us more lemons than we can juice. One where we can just laugh together when both kids are whining and we want to run for the hills.I've been putting a lot of effort into my work projects lately and I could tell that my husband was feeling forgotten. We were only speaking in passing and I had let all of my own relationship reminders fall by the wayside in lieu of everything else going on. Even though I'm as stubborn as a bull stuck in the mud I find it in me to reach out and hug him....it's amazing how such a small gesture can build a connection so fast. So not to say that I'm any sort of marriage expert but here are some tips that work for us to get the spark back when it feels like we're headed for the rocks.1. Hug and kiss each other OFTEN. It may sound super cheesy but real live touch builds so much connection.2. Know what's important to your spouse. If my husband doesn't take the time to get me a card on a special occasion he knows that I'll be really miffed.. It's something that he's always done and if he doesn't take the time I feel forgotten about. If he doesn't chip in with the work at home the tension slowly starts building in me until I lose it, not pretty! Not that I'm generalizing here but for most men (and surely some women!?)....dropping everything and jumping in the sack for a little roll in the hay is always well received. My husband believes that sex solves EVERYTHING.3. Appreciate one another. In a world where we are constantly trying to pack more in it's so easy to take for granted all that the other person does to make life happen. All it takes is a simple, ""I am so grateful for all that you do for us....."" or ""thank you for ....""4. Make time to speak to one another. Shut down the iPhones/ipads or anything else with a plug in the evening and talk. Go out on a date or sit out on your patio with a glass of wine. Make plans, talk about your dreams, be on the same team. There is a reason that every relationship expert will tell you that communication is key. Stay interested in one another.5. Remind yourself of your spouses value. I am constantly reminding myself to treat my husband like I would a cherished friend. He is after all the person that I chose to spend the rest of my life with which is pretty BIG so I would consider him my BFF of all time.6. Give compliments. We all like to feel good about ourselves and it's so nice to hear a genuine compliment. Tell your wife that she looks beautiful or your husband how proud you are of him.Relationships take effort and dedication as do most things worth having. I'd love to hear what works for you when it's seems like your bond is being stretched.My new website is going live soon so please check it out at www.health-fanatic.com !!"
