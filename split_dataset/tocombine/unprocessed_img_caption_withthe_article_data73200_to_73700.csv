0,TECH,What A Clash Between Press And Mizzou Protestors Can Teach Us,Alexander Howard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-a-clash-between-press-and-mizzou-protestors-can-teach-us_us_56422e29e4b0411d3072b048,You can't divorce the history of how U.S. media have depicted minorities from the distrust college activists have today.,2015-11-10,"University of Missouri students circle tents on the Carnahan Quadrangle, locking arms to prevent media from entering the space following the resignation of President Timothy W. Wolfe on Monday, Nov. 9, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5642391c180000a7003044e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A clash between University of Missouri journalists, staff and students Monday is a crucible for discussions about First Amendment rights in the United States. Now that so many American adults carry around smartphones that can capture and disseminate photos and videos instantly, ethical decisions that once were the sole responsibility of editors, reporters and correspondents are in everyone's hands.Tim Tai, a freelance photojournalist on assignment from ESPN tried to take pictures of an area at the university where students were protesting racism. In doing so, he has ended up being at the center of the story, despite his wish to be otherwise. As Tai pointed out on Twitter, a new Missouri law made college campuses public forums this year, which gave these protests First Amendment protections. The law also means that the public, press and students all have First Amendment rights on that quad. Students have the right to freedom of expression. Media have the right to cover what's happening in the public space. A “media-free zone” that the protesters designated on the campus quad is unconstitutional. University staff that encourage blocking media engaged in inexcusable behavior toward journalists. Here's video of the encounter between Tai and protesters: A day after the clash, there's been welcome shift: The student activists have adjusted their stance towards media access, calling the incident a ""teachable moment"" and handing out public service announcements regarding the First Amendment.Given the irresponsible, negative ways that #BlackLivesMatter activists have been portrayed in the media this fall, it's not hard to see why these college students would have been suspicious or even actively hostile to national media coverage.We can't simply divorce the history of how U.S. media have depicted minorities from the distrust of college activists today. Consider, for instance, how differently U.S. media has portrayed white suspects in shootings and black victims. As technology entrepreneur and blogger Anil Dash​ pointed out on Twitter, the ethics code from the Society for Professional Journalists includes a section on minimizing potential harms to the subjects of stories, not just sources.Last year, Dash wrote a post about what being ""public"" means to him, arguing that technology companies, media companies and the public all need to take a step back from how public is being defined and by whom:Public is not just what can be viewed by others, but a fragile set of social conventions about what behaviors are acceptable and appropriate. There are people determined to profit from expanding and redefining what’s public, working to treat nearly everything we say or do as a public work they can exploit.I don't agree with everything Dash wrote, but the entire post is worth reading. From my perspective, journalists need to be able to be present at public protests in public spaces to bear witness, but that doesn't mean that they must publish everything they see or hear. Now that 68 percent of Americans use smartphones, we also share a responsibility to respect the privacy of others.Publishing a photo or video online should not only have public interest value but balance potential harms against the long-term consequences of recording and publishing.I hope that in the days and month to come, students, staff and faculty at more universities around the country find ways to support both sides of that equation."

The department didn't say, however, when it would file an appeal with the Supreme Court -- and timing is critical if it wants the court to review the issue before President Barack Obama leaves office. The programs, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, and an expansion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, would allow millions of undocumented immigrants with longstanding ties to the U.S. to remain in the country and work legally. ""The Department of Justice remains committed to taking steps that will resolve the immigration litigation as quickly as possible in order to allow [the Department of Homeland Security] to bring greater accountability to our immigration system by prioritizing the removal of the worst offenders, not people who have long ties to the United States and who are raising American children,"" DOJ spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement. ""The Department disagrees with the Fifth Circuit’s adverse ruling and intends to seek further review from the Supreme Court of the United States,"" he continued.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit agreed on Monday to keep two of Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration from moving forward while considering a lawsuit from 26 states that contend DAPA and the expansion of DACA are unconstitutional.Nearly a year has passed since Obama announced the executive actions, which also include other policies that could prevent certain undocumented immigrants from being deported by prioritizing criminals and others for deportation. Still, they cannot work and lack official protections from deportation.In her dissent, appeals court Judge Carolyn Dineen King said the court had moved too slowly with its decision and potentially hindering the administration's chances to appeal to the Supreme Court.""I have a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made,"" she wrote. ""That mistake has been exacerbated by the extended delay that has occurred in deciding this 'expedited' appeal. There is no justification for that delay.""The Obama administration and immigrant rights groups have said they are confident the Supreme Court would rule in their favor and that DAPA and DACA are constitutional. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reiterated that point during a press briefing Wednesday.""We're confident in the power of the legal arguments,"" he said. ""And that's I think why you've seen the Department of Justice make such a quick decision to move this on up the line to the Supreme Court."" In the meantime, Earnest said, the administration would continue to prioritize serious criminals, recent border-crossers and national security threats for deportation.This article has been updated to include a statement from Josh Earnest."
3,SPORTS,Congressman Wants To Review NFL Domestic Violence Policies In Wake Of Greg Hardy Photos,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greg-hardy-nfl-domestic-violence-congress_us_564222b4e4b0307f2caf1256,"""The employment of this individual is sending the absolute wrong message.""",2015-11-10,Recently published photos from Greg Hardy's 2014 assault case has one congressman calling for another review of NFL policies.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56422a3814000069023ca5eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Texas Republican wants to review the NFL's domestic violence policies in the wake of newly released photos from Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy's 2014 assault case.Deadspin's publication of the gruesome photos last week led Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) to question why Hardy is still playing in the NFL. “These photos are disturbing. I want the NFL and the Players Association to explain why it’s acceptable for Greg Hardy to still be playing,"" he said in a Tuesday release. ""The Dallas Cowboys pride themselves on being ‘America’s Team,’ and they have an obligation to their fans, players, and families to conduct themselves with the highest professional integrity. The employment of this individual is sending the absolute wrong message on domestic violence.""While the photos have drawn criticism of the NFL's role in the case, at this point the league may have few options when it comes to further disciplining Hardy.A North Carolina judge convicted Hardy of assaulting his then-girlfriend, Nicole Holder, in 2014, but Hardy appealed. The case was dismissed in February when Holder stopped cooperating with prosecutors' investigation. (She reportedly reached an out-of-court financial settlement with Hardy.)The NFL placed Hardy on paid suspension during the appeal, and he missed all but one game of the 2014 season, his last as a member of the Carolina Panthers. The league tried to suspend him an additional 10 games -- unpaid -- this season, but the NFLPA argued that Hardy should not be subject to the NFL's new domestic violence policies because his incident happened before those rules were in place. An arbitrator agreed and reduced Hardy's suspension to four games in July.While the league may have exhausted its options, the Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones didn't have to sign Hardy, as they did in March. But even with the release of the photos, many of which the NFL saw as part of its investigation, the Cowboys have stood behind the Pro Bowl defensive end, saying in a statement last week that they ""entered into the agreement with Greg fully understanding that there would be scrutiny and criticism.""""We basically try to make, personnel decisions that are in the best interest of winning the football games,"" Jones told The Dallas Morning News on Tuesday.""We certainly have parameters that when we make decisions about players we know that they have to be eligible to play, and eligible to play means through our legal system, through our system in the NFL,"" he said. ""We have a very strong domestic violence policy in the NFL. In the case of some issues, and there are a handful of them, you get one chance, and if you mess that up, then you don't get a chance again.""After widespread criticism of his handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence incident, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell updated the league's domestic violence policy during the 2014 season. It now includes suspensions of at least six games for first offenses and possible lifetime bans for a second offense. The Rice case also led to congressional hearings on how each of the major sports leagues planned to further combat domestic violence.Though the details of the Hardy case were mostly known even before the pictures were released last week, Burgess said they ""provide a new opportunity"" for Congress to understand how the latest policies are being implemented by the league and the union.""I look forward to sitting down with both the NFL and NFLPA to better understand this situation and what can be done to ensure that those who put their hands on a woman or child are not rewarded,"" Burgess said.

The officer will not face civil rights charges in connection with the death of Dontre Hamilton.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A former Milwaukee police officer who was fired after he shot and killed a black man with mental illness will not face federal civil rights charges, the Justice Department announced Tuesday.The federal investigation into the death of Dontre Hamilton began after local prosecutors in Milwaukee announced last December that Officer Christopher Manney would not face criminal charges. The Justice Department found there was ""insufficient evidence"" to charge Manney in Hamilton's April 30, 2014, death.Manney shot Hamilton 14 times in a local park after workers at a nearby Starbucks called and complained about him sleeping there. The officer was subsequently fired from the force, and a panel in Milwaukee upheld the dismissal in March, finding that he violated protocol in his ""pat down"" and use of force against Hamilton.Hamilton's family was informed of the Justice Department decision in a meeting with federal officials on Tuesday morning. The department said in a statement that its ""comprehensive and independent review of the evidence"" included ""reviewing all information from the state investigation, reviewing all recorded interviews, consulting with the Milwaukee County medical examiner and reviewing the transcripts from Manney’s termination hearing by the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission.""But federal prosecutors and FBI agents determined there wasn't enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Manney willfully used unreasonable force against Hamilton.""To establish willfulness, federal authorities must show that the officer acted with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids. This is the highest standard of intent imposed by law,"" DOJ's statement read. ""Mistake, misperception, negligence or poor judgment are not sufficient to establish a federal criminal civil rights violation."" The decision, DOJ stated, ""is limited strictly to an application of the high legal standard required to prosecute the case under the federal civil rights statute; it does not reflect an assessment of any other aspect of the incident that led to Hamilton’s death."""

Some of these protests were no doubt small, but others, in cities like New York, San Francisco and Pittsburgh, had huge turnouts.The campaign’s startling political success became clear on Tuesday, if it wasn’t already. Hillary Clinton, the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, offered a message of encouragement directly to the strikers, while another candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), spoke to striking workers outside the U.S. Capitol. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) joined workers at a demonstration in Brooklyn. And both the city of Pittsburgh and the state of New York announced new policies centered on a $15 wage floor.In Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto (D) announced that city employees and contract workers would be paid at least $15 per hour by 2021, and in New York, the office of Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said all state employees would be making $15 by the end of 2018.  In a statement, the Fight for 15 described workers paid less than $15 an hour as “a voting bloc that can no longer be ignored.”""I think that these workers have shown in the past two years that they are a potent political force. They have been changing the debate,"" Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, told The Huffington Post. ""City councils and states have raised minimum wages as a result of this movement. It’s because of the courage of individual workers to strike and to be joined by other workers all across the service sector."" SEIU is the roughly 2-million-member labor union that’s been funding the Fight for 15 campaign. Three years in, it is still no clearer where exactly the campaign is headed, or how it plans to become a sustainable model for labor activism. For all its success in embarrassing low-wage employers like McDonald’s and raising local wage floors, the campaign and its strikes have not led to more dues-paying union members to financially support the cause. Meanwhile, SEIU has poured millions of dollars into the effort.Yet while its endgame remains murky, the campaign’s growing political muscle is obvious. According to Henry, the campaign aims to “expand the movement and take it to the ballot box.” Tuesday’s protests were scheduled one year ahead of the 2016 elections, and the campaign released a voter agenda, focused on a $15 minimum wage and union recognition, which it hopes to hold candidates to. Organizers said the day would culminate with a protest outside the GOP presidential debate Tuesday night in Milwaukee.One of the campaign’s biggest policy victories to date was a July decision by New York regulators to set a $15 minimum wage specifically for fast-food employees. That rate is gradually being phased in throughout the state, after an order issued by the state’s wage board. Meanwhile, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles are all raising their city minimum wages to $15 in the coming years.In Oakland on Tuesday morning, roughly 50 fast-food workers, union organizers and supporters flooded a McDonald’s, disrupting the tail end of the breakfast rush. Three workers behind the counter walked off the job to join them. The crowd, chanting in English and Spanish, temporarily forced the restaurant to stop serving food.Fast-food workers at the protest said they’d been deprived of overtime pay and weren’t able to use sick days. One worker, Ernestina Sandoval, 35, who’s worked for three years at a McDonald’s, said her wage has only climbed from $8 to $9.60.“If I saw [the owner] here, I’d turn my back on him, just like he’s turned his back on us,” Sandoval told HuffPost. “More goes into his pocket than ours. Still, he expects us to sacrifice.”Until now, the Fight for 15 campaign has focused primarily on industries where SEIU has been organizing workers -- fast food in particular, as well as child care and home care. But on Tuesday, workers affiliated with other unions were taking part in the Fight for 15 demonstrations.One of them, Letasha Irby, works at a factory in Selma, Alabama, that produces car seats and headrests for Hyundai cars. It’s just the sort of manufacturing job that Americans historically associate with solid, middle-class wages. Yet Irby says she earns only $12 per hour after a decade of service at her plant.Irby said that on Tuesday she made plans to drive to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, after her shift to join a Fight for 15 protest. Irby is a supporter of the United Auto Workers, who have been trying to organize her plant in Selma and have so far not succeeded.“I have a whole lot in common with them,” Irby, a 37-year-old Alabama native and mother of two, said of fast-food workers. “Whether it’s fast food, retail, child care … we’re all being underpaid for our services.”Another worker, Angela Simler, said she would be helping to host a Fight for 15 barbecue outside her place of employment, a T-Mobile call center in Wichita, Kansas. Simler supports a campaign by the Communications Workers of America to unionize her T-Mobile facility. She said she earns $12.43 per hour. As the mother of a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old, she said her wages don’t cut it, and every month presents wrenching decisions over which bills to pay and which to set aside. T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment.“Whether it’s fast food, Walmart, child care, T-Mobile, all these people are paid too little to support their families,” said Simler, 33. “The wages have remained stagnant for too long.”Berta Chacon took part in a protest in New York City on Tuesday. Chacon is not a fast-food worker -- she’s employed at a beauty salon in the city. But she, too, said she faces the same financial struggles as fast-food workers.“Our salaries are very low,” Chacon said in Spanish. “We are fighting for $15 an hour in order to survive in this city.”Willa Frej contributed reporting."

7,SPORTS,How The Mizzou Protests Demonstrate The Power Of College Athletes,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/missouri-protests-college-athletes_us_5641fde6e4b0411d3072713d,"""All of it boils down to athletes standing up.""",2015-11-10,Former Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter during a 2013 game against Iowa. Colter led the movement to form the first college athletes' players association.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56420cb314000069023ca577.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some advocates for college athletes say Tim Wolfe's announcement on Monday that he would resign from his position as the University of Missouri system president indicates how powerful student-athletes can be in affecting change.The president's decision came less than 48 hours after about 30 African-American players on the school's football team joined protests over Wolfe's handling of a series of racially motivated incidents on campus.The football players, who were joined Sunday by the rest of their team and head coach Gary Pinkel, were hardly the only ones speaking out. The Concerned Student 1950 movement and the Legion of Black Collegians, the school's black student association, had confronted the president at a Homecoming parade last month and protested on campus. Some faculty members walked out of classes last week, and Jonathan Butler, a Mizzou graduate student, launched a hunger strike to protest Wolfe.Kain Colter, the former Northwestern University quarterback who in 2014 launched an ultimately unsuccessful effort to form the first collegiate players union, says the fact that Mizzou's players threatened to skip practices and games as part of their protest highlighted the power college athletes have today at universities.""It takes a lot of courage to boycott, or to even threaten to boycott, a game you love. But they stood up,"" Colter said. ""I hope every athlete realizes the leverage they have to put pressure on the system.""The threat of a football boycott no doubt exacerbated the pressure on Wolfe and Missouri chancellor R. Bowen Loftin, who announced Monday that he would resign at the end of the year. A boycott would have had significant economic ramifications for the university -- for instance, Mizzou would have owed Brigham Young University $1 million if it had had to cancel Saturday's game in Kansas City because players refused to show up.""You see a lot of power because [athletes] do have a lot of value to these universities,"" Colter said. ""It's universities' biggest marketing arm. If they bring it up, they can affect real change. All of it boils down to athletes standing up. It's where a lot of their leverage lies.""Missouri's players are only the latest to wield that power against their own universities or the collegiate athletic system. In 2013, Grambling State University football players staged a strike and forfeited a game against Jackson State to protest facility conditions and other problems within the program. The University of Oklahoma's football team walked out of spring practice in March after members of the school's Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity were caught on video singing racial slurs.And there was also Colter's union movement, which, while primarily focused on college athletes and the NCAA, also asked the National Labor Relations Board to review previous decisions on bargaining rights for graduate students at private universities.That power has already caused changes in college sports, where the NCAA and its conferences in recent years have made small steps to address issues related to health and safety and scholarship costs that Colter's union effort and other athletes have raised. It has caught the attention, too, of administrators like Big XII Conference commissioner Bob Bowlsby, who said in September that he would not be surprised if college athletes decide to strike in the near future.But Missouri's players, like those at Oklahoma, also demonstrated athletes' abilities to influence broader campus issues -- a dynamic the Tiger football players referenced when they announced they would return to practice after the end of Butler's hunger strike.""We just wanted to use our platform to take a stance as fellow concerned students on an issue that has special meaning as a fellow black man's life was on the line,"" Mizzou safety Ian Simon said Monday while speaking at a demonstration.""Let this be a testament to all of the athletes across the country that you do have power,"" defensive end Charles Harris added.Given their outsized role on university campuses, it's likely athletes across the country will continue to wield that voice, Colter said.""The more athletes stand up and use that power, the more they'll realize how much value they have,"" he said.

That’s something we’ve got to respect,"" he said.The president also said that through his daughters and their friends he could already see a generational shift in attitudes towards gay people.""To Malia and Sasha and their friends, discrimination in any form against anyone doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t dawn on them that friends who are gay or friends’ parents who are same-sex couples should be treated differently than anyone else. That’s powerful,"" he said.""My sense is that a lot of parents across the country aren’t going to want to sit around the dinner table and try to justify to their kids why a gay teacher or a transgender best friend isn’t quite as equal as someone else,"" he continued. ""That’s also why it’s so important to end harmful practices like conversion therapy for young people and allow them to be who they are.""Obama told the magazine that the first openly gay person he could remember meeting was Lawrence Goldyn, one of his professors at Occidental College, who mentored LGBT students.""We became good friends. He went out of his way to advise lesbian, gay, and transgender students at Occidental, and keep in mind, this was 1978. That took a lot of courage, a lot of confidence in who you are and what you stand for.""Obama publicly stated his support for marriage equality for the first time in May of 2012, after a little nudge from Vice President Joe Biden. Before that, he had said he did not support same-sex marriage, a position his advisers said he took out of political necessity.As president, Obama has pushed for a number of protections and improvements for LGBT individuals, including repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, making it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation and pushing for an end to gay conversion therapy for LGBT youth.Read Out's full interview with Obama here.Also on HuffPost:"
9,TECH,Ellen Pao Won't Stop Talking About Sexism In Tech. And Neither Should You.,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ellen-pao-sexism-in-tech_us_564203c5e4b0307f2caee758,"“You are not alone. There are millions of women and men who are supporting you and want you to succeed.""",2015-11-10,Ellen Pao encouraged other women to speak out about inequality in the male-dominated tech and venture capital worlds in an essay for Lenny Letter on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564205c814000069023ca55e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"They called her “the most hated person on the Internet” and named her one of the pariahs of Silicon Valley. She lost her sex discrimination lawsuit against a prominent Bay Area venture capital firm and started an industry-wide conversation about gender in tech. Then she left her job as chief executive at one of the most controversial websites in the dark swamp of the Internet.But Ellen Pao will not be silenced.The former Reddit CEO just published an inspiring and brutal new essay about her career and the discrimination women face in law, venture capital and tech.Writing in Tuesday’s Lenny Letter, the email newsletter founded by “Girls” creator Lena Dunham and showrunner Jenni Konner, Pao tells women struggling to get ahead in male-dominated workplaces, “Do not give up.”“You are not alone. There are millions of women and men who are supporting you and want you to succeed,"" writes Pao, who resigned from her interim CEO post at Reddit in July amid controversy over changes she'd made there regarding online harassment. ""Many people will try to blame you -- for some, it’s just too hard to acknowledge their own failings and the failings of our system. That’s on them, not on you.""There aren’t many women working in tech, and even fewer make it into venture capital. Pao runs through some of the depressing stats: Only 6 percent of VC partners are women -- down from 10 percent in 1999. If those in the tech industry really wanted to change the numbers, they’d be changed by now, she points out.But there’s hope in the numbers, she says.Simply by tracking and publishing the data, we can initiate a conversation about the problem. “The biggest positive difference over the past 20 years is how women and minorities are sharing others’ bad behavior, data, and their own experiences publicly,"" Pao writes. ""You can’t get away with making thoughtless remarks anymore.”Pao started an industry-wide conversation about sexism when she sued her former employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, claiming the firm didn’t promote her because she was a woman and then fired her for complaining about it. She lost her case at trial and didn’t appeal. But the case highlighted an issue that many women in the closed-off VC world were reluctant to talk about. Pao's honesty inspired many.Women in venture capital are still pretty reluctant to talk, though. As an editor at The Huffington Post, I’ve had many conversations with women in the VC world who say that they don’t want to draw attention to themselves “as women,” but want their work to speak for itself. I've spoken with male VCs who've told me they like hiring women because ""mothers are really hard-working"" -- as though all women are mothers or something. Creepy little comments like that signal a big problem in the male-dominated world.Opening up about the problems we face at work can only serve to make things better for everyone. Pao recounts how after she told another female investor about what happened to her, her colleague shared her own terrible story of harassment -- one she’d told no one about.“Don’t be silent,” Pao writes. “Sharing my story privately, and eventually publicly, meant a lot to me and to others. Women and men are talking about gender and discrimination issues across the globe.”To read Pao's essay, sign up for Lenny Letter here."
10,POLITICS,The Fed Just Can't Stop Hiring Former Goldman Sachs Bankers,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-goldman-sachs_us_564218fee4b0307f2caf02e6,"This time, it's the head of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank.",2015-11-10,Neel Kashkari will be the new president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564221e8290000d7004dc9a2.jpeg?cache=TpjNxRSMy0&ops=crop_8_229_3992_2365%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Federal Reserve is in a bit of a rut -- it keeps hiring former Goldman Sachs executives. On Tuesday, the Minneapolis Fed named Neel Kashkari as its new president. In August, the Dallas Fed named former Goldman Sachs Vice Chairman Robert Kaplan as its president. With Kashkari's appointment, four of the Fed's 12 regional branches are run by former Goldman executives. The head of the Philadelphia Fed, Patrick Harker, was the trustee of the Goldman Sachs Trust, and the head of the New York Fed, William Dudley, was the bank's chief economist.Kashkari began his career in finance at Goldman Sachs, then joined the U.S. Treasury, where he eventually ran the massive bank bailout program enacted in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. After leaving Treasury, he joined the investment manager PIMCO and unsuccessfully ran for governor of California in 2014 as a Republican.For its part, Goldman Sachs is trying to do away with the perception that it is too close to its regulators. In the wake of a criminal case where a former New York Fed employee used confidential government documents while working as a Goldman banker, the firm changed its conflict of interest policies to begin evaluating what work employees would be restricted from doing before the formal interview process begins. Beyond his bank background, Kashkari is a bit of a left-field choice for a top Fed role. He's not an economist and his previous jobs didn't involve monetary policy. His role in the Troubled Asset Relief Program did, however, put him squarely at the center of ensuring the stability of the financial sector, which is one of the goals of the Federal Reserve. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published shortly after his appointment was announced, Kashkari did not detail his view on interest rate policy. Instead, he said he broadly approved of recent Fed policy and would rely on data to form his view. Kashkari will take office on Jan. 1, 2016. He replaces Narayana Kocherlakota, who shifted his view significantly in the face of changing economic circumstances. Kocherlakota changed from favoring higher interest rates to fight inflation to advocating for maintaining low interest rates to stimulate the economy.Kashkari told WSJ his resume would be an asset and that it shouldn't be boiled down to just Goldman Sachs and the Treasury. To manage TARP, “the fact that I had went to Wharton and got my MBA and worked at Goldman are all fine, but I really relied on my engineering skills as a research engineer working on NASA missions,” Kashkari told The Wall Street Journal, employing the rarely used ""people criticize me for being a banker, but really I’m a rocket scientist"" tactic of feigning modesty.Also on HuffPost:"
