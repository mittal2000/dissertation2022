""It gave me a chance to set the arc in motion for the season,"" he said to the LA Times, ""and it gave me a little more input into what was going to happen.""King was pleased with the idea of expanding ""Under The Dome,"" because the book turned out to be more ""condensed"" than he had planned. The story spanned three or four weeks, where he had initially intended to have a timeline of many months. Although, as Buzzfeed notes, ""The idea that the novel could have been even more expansive may come as a surprise to readers who made it through Under the Dome’s daunting 1,000-plus pages.""Other reasons King may be jealous of Martin include, but are not limited to, his glorious beard.

For Nino, his sickness results in hallucinations. His fevered dreams of a troubled past in the Dominican Republic activate issues of betrayal, regret and sexual longing. Barceló Con Hielo, written by Marco Antonio Rodriquez, who also plays Nino, poignantly delves into the tricky torment of memory with both humor and pathos.Now off-Broadway at the Repertorio Español, Rodriquez posits a family drama in which two sons, the responsible Sergio, a young painter, (Ivan Camilo) and irresponsible Dennis (Javier Fano), cope with their ailing father. Set in Washington Heights, where Nino rails against fellow Dominicans, he is haunted by visions of Joaquín Balaguer, a former president of the Dominican Republic, and longtime aide to military strongman Rafael Trujillo, who ruled for three decades.The suppression of human rights proves costly to Nino. His tragic tale is told in flashbacks. We meet Jastón (Modesto Lacen) his Army friend, who touts the new regime, and Fello (Jerry Soto), his revolutionary brother, who notes ""dictatorship hides under the wing of democracy."" His bitterness, like his disease, demands he confront his demons. Rodriquez is adept at illustrating Nino's guilt and heartache, as well as the pain of generational conflict. He captures the rage of regret and understands that in order to come to terms with life, one is forced to make peace with -- or at least acknowledge -- the past. Director Jose Zayas has done justice to Rodriquez's multilayered work, aided by solid performances from his cast.

BROWN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76055220000bb01dd0b89.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is the worlds' sport passion. It is the first team sport that most American kids play. Every Saturday morning in the fall, it is possible to drive coast to coast and see fields and fields that are crowded with youthful players and families rooting them on. Why has the MLS not been able to emerge as a widely watched and supported league like the NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL? Will the excitement over the first round victory by the U.S. and its continued success be a game-changer for the future of the MLS?The MLS Cup in 2013 between Real Salt Lake and Sporting Kansas City set a record for the least viewed MLS final ever. Only 505,000 viewers tuned in. Salt Lake City and Kansas City are smaller markets and the University of Missouri had a bowl game scheduled, but the MLS on NBCSN only averaged 209,500 fans for this season's first four games. This is lower than WNBA Ratings. The good news is that the U.S. team's 2-1 World Cup defeat of Ghana drew a 6.3 household rating and 11 million viewers -- the highest-rated and most-viewed men's soccer match ever on ESPN or ESPN2. Including Univision's Spanish telecast, New York had a 14 percent share of television households, which is higher than the average for Giants and Jets NFL games last year.The NFL by far is the most popular sports league in America. The Divisional-Round playoff games last season drew an average of 34.3 million viewers. The Conference Championship games drew an average of 53 million. And the Super Bowl drew 111.5 million viewers with an average 46.4 percent of television households. Why is it that a sport with amazing athletes performing incredible feats cannot garner that type of following at the professional level?I first contemplated this disconnect in 1994 when I represented the U.S. Men's team in the World Cup held in this country. Players like Alexi Lalas, Cobi Jones, Tony Meola, and Paul Caligiuri were homegrown, telegenic athletes with intriguing background stories. The Women's team that featured Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain had attractive, champion athletes. And yet, it did not translate to MLS success. Players like Landon Donovan are everything Americans look for in role model athletes.One theory is that Americans are familiar with games that have a chance for success or failure on every play. We like intense bursts of action with commercial breaks and lots of scoring. Soccer is a continuous play sport without much scoring. It does not have breaks to discuss what has happened or to go to the restroom. American audiences also like the contact and violence associated with football and hockey; basketball has heavy contact under the basket. We also love stars. The MLS brought the highest profile athlete in the world -- David Beckham -- to the second largest market in America, and it still did not catapult ratings.Part of the problem is ""chicken-and-egg."" The fanaticism over European soccer makes it an incredibly profitable sport with the ability to attract players from around the world with rich contracts. If more revenue was available to the MLS, they could compete for the world's best. But stadia averaging 20,000 fans and tiny television ratings don't provide the necessary financial largesse. When I once had the temerity to suggest that American soccer could adjust with the rules to better fit American taste, I received the worst hate letters of my career.I hope that the American team is able to go on an extended winning run in the World Cup. Local radio in Southern California is actually broadcasting each game, not just the U.S. team. The popularity of social media has played a large role in engaging fans and spreading awareness of the games. A rapidly growing demographic of Latinos in America with a passion for the sport is also helping lead the charge of soccer's expansion in the states. One can only imagine the impact a Latino superstar would have on the MLS if he was recruited to play for a city with a large Latino demographic such as Los Angeles.The MLS has a visionary Commissioner in Don Garber and very successful and committed owners. The key to building the MLS is more television exposure, star building, quality in-stadium experience, and clever marketing. The popularity of this World Cup provides another chance for building U.S. professional soccer.A version of this post originally appeared on Forbes.com."

May a child never again have to suffer like this. I pray for him continuously. Do not despair,"" the spokesman quoted the pope as saying.The boy's parents and grandfather were part of a drugs trafficking clan of the 'Ndrangheta. Social workers have come under criticism for entrusting the boy to his maternal grandfather, a convicted drugs runner who was out on bail.STAND AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIMEThe crime group has been much harder for investigators to combat than the Sicilian Mafia because its structure is more lateral than hierarchical and its tightly-knit crime families are less flashy than the Sicilian mob and harder to penetrate.A 2013 study by Demoskopia, an economic and social research institute, estimated the 'Ndrangheta's annual turnover at some 53 billion euros ($72 billion) in 30 countries, equivalent to about 3.5 percent of Italy's total official economic output.Around half of its revenues came through drug trafficking, the study found.In the prison, which holds a number of 'Ndrangheta criminals, the pope told the inmates they should not waste their time behind bars but seek forgiveness from God for their crimes and emerge rehabilitated.Francis, who has condemned organized crime several times since his election in March, 2013, later addressed priests in the cathedral of Cassano all' Jonio, a run-down town of mostly drab concrete houses in the mountains near the Adriatic.The bishop of Cassano, Nunzio Galantino is seen as one of the most progressive in Italy's poorer, underdeveloped south and has taken strong stands against organized crime.But there have been instances of collusion of some priests in other areas of Calabria where the 'Ndrangheta is strongest, further south along the Italian peninsula near Reggio Calabria.

BORDER POSTS ATTACKEDA government forces spokesman said the separatists used mortars and sniper fire to attack Ukrainian posts at Izvareno and Uspenka on the border, wounding nine Ukrainian officers.Rebels with large-caliber machineguns and grenade-launchers also attacked a Ukrainian position at Avdiyivka, near the main regional town of Donetsk, and a Ukrainian post at Kreminna.Separatists controlling Slaviansk also attacked Ukrainian forces on Karachun hill overlooking the town with mortars and grenade-launchers, the spokesman, Vladyslav Seleznyov, said.""In all these episodes, the attacks of the (rebel) fighters were deflected"" without loss, Seleznyov said.Poroshenko announced the week-long ceasefire on Friday night, urging the rebels to lay down their arms and warning that Ukrainian forces would hit back if attacked.Ukrainian forces also repelled two attacks by around 50 heavily-armed fighters in the early morning on an air defense base at Avdiyivka, which houses surface-to-air missiles, the defense ministry said. No Ukrainian personnel were hurt.The rebels, who have seized strategic points in major towns including Donetsk and set up ""people's republics"", saying they want to join Russia, insisted Ukraine had broken its own ceasefire.Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic, told a news conference the ceasefire was not working and appealed to Russia to send in peacekeeping forces.""Since last evening, combat activities are continuing. Poroshenko's artillery is bombing Slaviansk and the air force has made several raids. Words about a ceasefire as always were just that - words,"" Borodai said.""The anti-terrorist operation against the people of the Donbass is in full swing,"" he said.Pavel Gubarev, a prominent rebel leader, told Rossiya-24 TV channel that either Ukrainian troops were not obeying orders or Poroshenko ""is lying"", adding: ""There is no ceasefire at all.""The insurgency in the Russian-speaking east erupted in April after street protests in the capital Kiev toppled the Moscow-backed leader Viktor Yanukovich. Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.Poroshenko has offered an amnesty to separatists who disarm voluntarily as well as corridors to allow fighters from Russia or pro-Russian Ukrainian separatists to leave safely for Russia. DEFIANCEUkraine, meanwhile, expressed concern on Saturday about an increase in Russian movements near the border.""The continuing concentration of Russian armed forces and their heightened activity near the border with Ukraine causes special concern against a background of numerous facts that confirm weapons and military equipment are being supplied to the terrorists,"" Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.In Donetsk about 100 troops of the self-styled separatist Donetsk People's Republic took an oath of an allegiance, in apparent defiance of Poroshenko's peace plan.In a ceremony on the town's Lenin Square, armed fighters, some wearing masks, pledged they would ""defend the Donetsk People's Republic to the last drop of blood"".""We swear, we swear, we swear,"" they chanted in unison.Alexei, a miner, said he decided to take up arms last week: ""I am 43. I have children. I had a job but I dropped everything to defend the homeland.""A number of women, many in tears, rushed to hug troops and give them flowers. ""A great day, a great day, we love our army. They will protect us from fascists,"" said Nastya, 32, holding hands with a masked soldier.Across the square, far from the crowd, Mykola, a 23-year-old student from Donetsk, said he despised the rebels.""They are stupid and short-sighted and brainwashed by Moscow's propaganda and common people will continue to suffer."" He refused to give his full name, saying he feared reprisals for his pro-Ukrainian position.

Indeed, previous to the 51 pit bulls seized from Vick's infamous Bad Newz Kennels in 2007, animals pulled from fighting were routinely euthanized. As the New York Times reported at the time, PETA and many other groups argued that the Vick dogs should also be put down.“These are celebrity dogs,” PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk said in 2008. “[Rehabilitation for such dogs] isn’t a good use of money, it isn’t the best uses of time. The Vick dogs are the least likely candidates for success.""Best Friends argued otherwise -- and won that battle, taking in 22 of the most physically and emotionally traumatized of the ""Vicktory"" dogs, as they came to be known. The Vick dogs' remarkable second acts, many as loving family dogs, has paved the way for other abused dogs to be considered as individuals rather than as inherently damaged and dangerous animals who can't go on to live normal lives. A minority of states don't allow dogs seized from fighting operations to be considered on an individual basis, as Best Friends says in a letter the group is suggesting supporters send to Michigan lawmakers (there's a similar Delaware action alert):There are currently only 13 states that have archaic laws prohibiting the adoption of fight-bust puppies and dogs, and Michigan is unfortunately one of them. Florida repealed their law in 2011. Indeed, even the American Bar Association's House of Delegates passed a resolution calling for the evaluation and humane disposition of victims of cruelty, including fight-bust dogs.Or, as VanKavage puts it: ""Punishing dogs for the crimes of their abusive owners is unconscionable.""

The fundraiser comes a day after the White House announced plans for Obama to sign an executive order that would prohibit federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafc944210000e700c7071d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lost in all the online coverage of President Obama's speech at the DNC LGBT Gala this week in New York -- with his powerful words on the AIDS crisis and his announcement that he would sign an executive order barring federal contractors from firing us, which garnered a standing ovation -- was a challenge to our community that few noticed. Whether the event's wealthy LGBT donors cheered loudly as Obama ended his speech simply because of its inclusive-sounding words and great cadence or because they actually agreed with the challenge and change those words mean for our community's work, only time will tell.Obama ended his speech with a challenge to our community to expand its agenda into a broadly progressive one, looking beyond our own fight for equality to the issues that continue to hold back far too many Americans -- social-justice issues like poverty, racial and gender discrimination, immigration, and health care. It's as if he'd just read Urvashi Vaid's Irresistible Revolution, with its frustration at our narrow focus on marriage equality. Vaid has often seemed like a lonely voice among our LGBT leaders as she's yearned for a more substantive agenda with race, class, and gender at its foundation, knowing that it would produce greater and more meaningful change for a larger number of people.Are we ready to take up this challenge? Will our donors keep writing checks in response to appeals that aren't solely focused on marriage? Can we become the community that finally ends AIDS for white gay men and black straight women alike? Can we lead on issues like youth homelessness and a living wage for all workers?I wonder. I hope.Here was the end of Obama's speech:This is a country where -- no matter who you are, or what you look like, or how you came up, or what your last name is, or who you love -- if you work hard and you take responsibility, you should be able to make it. That's the story of America. That's the story of this movement: people who stand up, and come out, and march, and organize, and fight to expand the rights we enjoy and extend them to other people; people who work against the odds to build a nation in which nobody is a second-class citizen, [where] everybody is free to be who they are, and ... you're judged based on: Are you kind, and competent, and work hard, and treat each other with respect, and are a team player, and look after your community, and care [for] and love and cherish your kids? That's how we're supposed to be judged."

Rick Perry gives a speech during the Texas GOP Convention in Fort Worth, Texas on Thursday, June, 5, 2014. In his address, the longest-serving governor in the state's history focused more on the future and national issues than his political legacy at home. (AP Photo/Rex C. Curry)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafc9451f000039012319b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you are gay and you are wishing upon a star, it is probably not a good idea for it to be the Lone Star of Texas. This past week that particular entity has been more than a little dim in terms of passing out bright news for gay people.In Texas the anti-gay rhetoric has been more absurd, if that is possible, than it has been in other LGBT-unfriendly states. The recent news has been a trifecta of idiocy, with a pair of gay husbands being legally kept off their own sons' birth certificates, the leading political party embracing abusive therapy for gay teens, and a governor declaring homosexuality a destructive behavioral genetic disease.Anti-marriage-equality pundits have claimed that marriage should be reserved only for people who can procreate together. Texans Jason Hanna and Joe Riggs probably don't agree with that assessment, but they made children anyway. With science and planning on their side, they have both fathered a pair of twin boys. Each dad has a biological tie to one of the boys, and the boys are both related to each other through the egg donor. For me, having adopted my ""twin"" boys as infants from foster care, sharing DNA was not something I felt was important or needed. Jason and Joe wanted it for their family. This is where choice comes in, how we each choose to create our families. Afterwards, ultimately that choice is unimportant. As life kicks in, where the children came from is not the issue; the issue is how to protect and love them.The state of Texas is currently hindering how Jason and Joe protect their boys, and it has put their children at risk. Neither man is listed as the legal father of either of the boys. If they were legally married, they both would be listed on the birth certificates of both boys. Insanity, welcome to Texas.At the same time, the state's Republican Party has embraced ""reparative therapy"" in its party platform. In practical terms, since all legislation against such ""therapy,"" whose goal is to change people from gay to straight, has been aimed at protecting teens below the age of consent, this proposal specifically targets young people, who would be subjected to psychological abuse, according to assessments by all the major mental-health oversight organizations. Gov. Rick Perry has jumped on board and declared homosexuality to be a biological disposition akin to alcoholism.He has been rightly taken to task for this conjecture. It has been pointed out to him that people under the influence of alcohol excesses pose great harm to themselves and society, while people under the constant influence of their sexual orientations, which is pretty much most living and breathing adults, do not. It should be noted that while under the influence of their individual bouts of homosexuality, Jason and Joe have done wild madcap behaviors like holding annual Toys for Tots drives in their home, bringing the joy of hundreds of teddy bears to children suffering from cancer. Perry's retort has been a compelling blank stare and a shrug.I feel uniquely qualified to speak on this controversy, since besides being a lifelong homosexual, I also have over three decades of continuous recovery from alcoholism. In the process of maintaining that recovery, people in my situation are often called to help those who are suffering from the addiction disease, and in some cases actually provide intervention.Gov. Perry clearly needs one. Here it is:Dear Gov. Perry,Please like the evoL= Facebook page here.Follow me on Twitter @ JandJDad."
