The traumas and memories, too. Researchers have found evidence that we (well, mice) really can pass life experience down through the generations. A study this week in the journal Nature Neuroscience is one more data point in the field of “transgenerational epigenetic inheritance” -- marrying the cool detachment of science with the messy emotion of life, exploring how we are the product of our individual experience, and all of humankind’s. Specifically, a team at the Emory University School of Medicine subjected mice to the scent of acetophenone a relatively pleasant smell, somewhat like almonds or cherries. While sniffing the chemical the mice were subjected to small but painful shocks, and soon just a whiff of the acetophenone, even without an accompanying shock, made them shudder with fear. Then sperm from those fearful mice was used to create offspring who, it turned out, were also averse to the smell from birth, as were those in the next generation -- the children and grandchildren of the initial test subjects. In other words, a gene for behavior was apparently changed by the environment and those changes were passed along. Science has long suspected that what happens to a parent or grandparent can have physical repercussions on children and grandchildren; it has been shown, for instance, that children who were conceived in Holland during the famine brought on by WWII are more likely to have developed heart disease and diabetes as adults. But this study raises the possibility that psychological and emotional traits can be transmitted as well. Through a scientific lens, findings like these will go a long way toward explaining and treating disorders that run in families. As Professor Marcus Pembrey, from University College London, told the BBC: ""It is high time public health researchers took human transgenerational responses seriously. I suspect we will not understand the rise in neuropsychiatric disorders or obesity, diabetes and metabolic disruptions generally without taking a multigenerational approach.""And looked at more poetically, it is evidence that we are shaped by our pasts and linked to our ancestors. This is a humbling reminder (though we pride ourselves on our individuality and free will, we’re basically a collection of neurons, chromosomes and electrical pulses). It could also induce some parental guilt in those who are so inclined. (It’s because of me that my child is anxious...) But mostly it is confirmation of what we already somehow knew: that we carry our histories within and pass our fears and our dreams along. "

With all of the impending chaos that the season brings, here are some reasons you should start planning your wedding now and claim some of the most sought-after vendors before the holidays pass by. It's never too soon to start planning.1. You'll beat the bridal rush. With future fiancés preparing to pop the question over the holiday season, engagement ring sales experience a boost in December. Thus the rush to the best vendors is next! All of the essential people -- from the coordinator to the photographer -- who will make your big day go off without a hitch are filling up their calendars with consultations and wedding dates. Holiday season tends to be a slower time of year for wedding professionals, so it's a great time to set up appointments for wedding gowns and flowers to ensure you get your pick before the rush and avoid competition.2. It's the perfect time to tell family. What better time to announce your engagement than when the family is all together? Many brides prefer to opt out of making the big announcement via their favorite social media sites and instead wait to announce the good news to their friends and families in person. Go against the grain and hold off a bit longer to surprise your loved ones with the news in person this holiday season. Also, take note of those who offer to help you with the wedding. Whether it is the day of the wedding and you need an extra hand or months in advance and you need help with a project, call them up! Delegating tasks can be difficult, but will help you out and be a wonderful way to include everyone in the celebration of your marriage.3. It's a good opportunity to take and plan engagement photos. Don't forget to book your engagement session with your photographer as soon as possible. Engagement photos are not only a great addition to save-the-dates and invitations, but they are also a good way to get to know your photographer before the wedding day. Regardless the season for your shoot, call them now and get it in the books. Then send your photographer your (once-secret) wedding Pinterest board and start brainstorming to get the engagement photos you have always dreamed of! Think of the location, the poses you like, the outfits (matching plaid?). Get creative and bring props and signs, go someplace unexpected like a coffee shop or your special place and have fun with the photos. They are an expression of you as a unique couple and are meant to display the love that you have for one another.4. You'll relieve some stress. Planning a wedding can be a stressful project, but once you get the big to-dos checked off of your growing list, it gets down to the details. Set the date and get your vendors booked, then worry about the little things after the holiday season has passed. Do not forget to do your research and be smart when picking through vendors to find the perfect match! Getting these things out of the way now ensures that these tasks will not be in the back of your mind and you can enjoy being truly present with the people you are with.5. If you pick a date now, you can let all your close family and friends know at holiday gatherings. By the time the holidays are in full swing, you have already set the date, got a venue, booked your photographer, chosen your catering team, and maybe even wandered through some flower shops. Having some of these details ready to go is a great way to get the date out there and creates a conversation topic for even the most awkward of your relatives. It is never too soon to start planning for the big day -- the sooner the better. The advantage of accomplishing some of the big items on your list is clear. Get it done early and have the peace of mind for the holiday season -- you'll thank us later.By Clane Gessel Photography"
