Upon landing, I have received scores of mostly obscene and sick calls, voicemails and text messages,” Pelosi told her colleagues, urging them to keep their phones and incoming text messages away from their family members and children.“This is a sad course of events, not only for us, but more importantly for our country,” said Pelosi, who earlier in the week blamed Russia for the cyber attack and called it an “electronic Watergate” akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters that ultimately brought down Republican President Richard Nixon.John Ramsey, the House’s chief information security officer, sent a memo to lawmakers and aides whose information had been made public urging them to change passwords for all their accounts and to consider changing their non-House email addresses.He said the hacker had uploaded a spreadsheet with a mix of House and personal email addresses and cellphone numbers for “nearly every” House Democrat and “an assorted number of Republicans,” and similar information for hundreds of staffers.“Along with the Excel file, ‘Guccifer 2.0’ uploaded documents that included the account names and passwords for an assortment of subscription services used by the DCCC. Initial analysis identifies some members’ home addresses, along with their spouse’s name, marital status, and religion,” the memo said.U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Guccifer 2.0 is an individual or group operating with or for the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency. Russia has denied involvement in the breach.The potential Russian involvement in the cyber attack has ignited a fierce campaign debate, with Democrats accusing the Russians of trying to aid Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.But U.S. officials suspect the operation and others directed at the DNC and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign were more likely an attempt to pursue email chains into classified networks or in search of national security policy information than to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. election.“The Russian assumption probably is that it doesn’t matter much who wins the election, because Wall Street and other powerful lobbies really run the country,” one of the officials said on Saturday, speaking like the others on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments.“The old Soviet belief hasn’t faded completely when it comes to foreign policy,” the official said.(Additional reporting by John Wolcott; Editing by Paul Simao)"

The credentials allow reporters access to press-only areas of his campaign events. He has already banned other outlets, including The Washington Post.On Saturday, the New York newspaper published an article detailing failed efforts to make Trump focus his campaign on the general election.“These are the most dishonest people,” Trump said. “Maybe we’ll start thinking about taking their press credentials away from them.”Trump visiting Connecticut, a heavily Democratic state, raised eyebrows among many Republicans.“It’s asinine that he would be in Connecticut holding a public rally less than 90 days before the election,” said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. “You don’t see Hillary publicly campaigning in Idaho and Mississippi. I have to think this proves the candidate is running the campaign, which explains why it’s such a disaster of biblical proportions.”At several points the crowd chanted “lock her up,” a frequent campaign rally chant in reference to Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.Trump told the crowd that normally he responds by saying he intends instead to defeat her in the Nov. 8 election, but this time added, “You know what? You have a point!”Trump also dropped his recent efforts to say he was not being serious when he said Obama was the “founder” of the Islamic State militant group .“It’s the opinion of myself and a lot of people that he was the founder,” Trump told the crowd.Democrats and Republicans alike have criticized Trump’s assertion as patently false.Trump took a detour from attacking Clinton’s economic record to discuss the 1998 scandal involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky and former President Bill Clinton, whom Republicans attempted to remove from office.“Remember when he said, he did not have sex with that woman, and a couple of weeks later, oh you got me,” Trump said, to cheers. He then made reference to a blue dress that became a symbol in the investigation. “I’m so glad they kept that dress, so glad they kept that dress, because it shows what the hell they are.”(Editing by Sandra Maler)"

Hackett Police Chief Darrell Spells was also wounded in the shooting, which led to one man’s arrest.After the shooting, police announced that a patrol car Kina had been sitting in was riddled with bullets from the day’s violence. When officers inspected the car, they found some blood inside but the dog gone.“We are unsure of the extent of her injuries, but she cannot be located at this time. Members are out searching for her still,” the police department said in a Facebook post Wednesday.David Archer, who lives a few miles from the scene of Wednesday’s shooting, said once he heard the news, he immediately had a feeling that Kina may be nearby. Fortunately for everyone, he was right.The wounded K-9 had run onto his property. After Archer spotted the dog and called 911, he was rewarded with an endearing reunion between Kina and her handler, KNWA-News reported.“As soon as he walked into the yard, he yelled for that dog, and that dog came running to him like a lost puppy to his owner or something. I mean, them two had a great reunion,” Archer told the local news station.By Saturday, Kina was photographed recovering like a queen, lying on a new bed in front of a table piled high with donated dog toys and treats. The photo was posted along with a Facebook update from a local veterinarian who reported that she’s “doing very well.”“Her appetite is great. She has gotten needed rest and has gained three pounds of body weight from her food and water,” the vet said.Greenwood police are meanwhile raising money to help pay off her veterinarian bills and purchase GPS outfitting and a K-9 car kennel. As of Sunday, a GoFundMe account set up by the department has about $800 raised of a $10,000 goal."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by an astonishing 20 points in the Democratic primary.Based on the CBS/YouGov results, Clinton is winning the state by an even greater margin than President Barack Obama did in 2012 when he beat his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, by 6 points.HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates publicly available polls, shows Trump trailing Clinton 34 percent to 40 percent.New Hampshire holds only 4 electoral votes, but as polls show Trump behind in several critical battleground states, he increasingly can’t afford to lose the Granite State. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight polls-only and polls-plus model projects that if Clinton wins New Hampshire, it could push her to victory, even if she loses in major swing states like Ohio and Florida. CBS/YouGov finds that Trump is losing badly among women in the state, and his chances for recovery in that demographic appear slim. Just 29 percent of New Hampshire women polled say they support Trump, while 51 percent support Clinton. In addition, 91 percent of the state’s female respondents say they are unlikely to change their minds.Trump holds just a 4-point edge over Clinton among male voters in New Hampshire.The GOP nominee is also having more trouble uniting his party than his rival. Seventy-eight percent of New Hampshire Republicans support Trump, but 93 percent of New Hampshire Democrats support Clinton.CBS/YouGov also shows Trump losing in Florida by 5 points to Clinton. He’s ahead in Georgia, but only by 4 points. Georgia usually votes Republican and has not previously been considered a battleground state. This year, it’s looking like it could be a toss-up and might expand Clinton’s path to victory. According to HuffPost Pollster, Trump is 3 points behind Clinton in Florida and just 1 point ahead of her in Georgia. Recent polls have also shown Trump struggling in crucial Rust Belt states, as well as other critical swing states. HuffPost Pollster currently shows him trailing Clinton by 8 points nationally.CBS/YouGov surveyed 990 likely voters in New Hampshire, 1,194 in Florida, and 998 in Georgia online on August 10-12. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Read more here.PREVIOUSLY: Olympic gold medalist Ryan Lochte had a gun cocked and placed to his forehead during a robbery involving three other U.S. swimmers in Rio de Janeiro, he told NBC’s Billy Bush.The 12-time Olympic medalist said he was in a taxi with fellow gold medalists Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and Jimmy Feigen early Sunday when several armed men posing as police officers confronted them.“They pulled out their guns, they told the other swimmers to get down on the ground — they got down on the ground. I refused, I was like, ‘We didn’t do anything wrong, so I’m not getting down on the ground,’” the 32-year-old said.That’s apparently when things got hairy.“The guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said, ‘Get down,’ and I put my hands up, I was like, ‘Whatever.’ He took our money, he took my wallet — he left my cell phone, he left my credentials,” Lochte said.In a statement, the U.S. Olympic committee said that “all four athletes are safe and cooperating with authorities.”Lochte later released a statement on Instagram and Twitter that thanked his “family, friends and fans for the overwhelming support and concern I have received today.” “While it is true that my teammates and I were the victims of a robbery early Sunday morning, what is most important is that we are safe and unharmed,” the post read in part.Lochte’s mother, Ileana Lochte, who is in Rio, first reported the incident to Fox Sports News Australia. She said her son was heading to meet Brazilian swimmer Thiago Pereira when they were held up after stopping for gas. “They just took their wallets and basically that was it,” she later told USA Today. “I think they’re all shaken up.”She also said her son called her after the incident and described the encounter as “terrifying.”Lochte, Bentz and Conger earned gold medals after the U.S. men’s team dominated in the 4x200 freestyle relay. Feigen earned gold in the men’s 4x100 freestyle relay.A spokesman for the International Olympic Committee previously denied that the incident took place when reporters asked about it. Requests for comment from USA Swimming and the IOC were not immediately returned.This story was updated with Ryan Lochte’s statement and additional information after his interview with Billy Bush.For more Olympics coverage:Michael Phelps Ends Olympic Career With One More Gold Medal"

Wallace asked Pence whether the “sarcasm” argument was getting old.“I don’t think it’s getting old at all, Chris,” Pence said. “Donald Trump made his way through a very competitive primary because he spoke not like your typical politician, but just plainly, like your everyday American. And speaking plainly is exactly what the American people will anticipate in the course of this election, but more importantly, they’re going to have a president who tells the American people exactly what’s on his mind. And the American people are going to hear him and hear him loudly.” Trump’s poll numbers have been tanking since he had one of the worst weeks a U.S. presidential candidate has ever experienced on the campaign trail. He booted a mother with a crying baby from a political rally, insulted Ghazala Khan, a Muslim American woman who lost her son in the Iraq War, and said that if his daughter Ivanka were sexually harassed at work, he would expect her to just “find a new career.”  Pence said he is still “very confident” that he and Trump can win. “Stay tuned,” Pence said. “It’s still early in this campaign.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Curated by Michael Zakian, the Weisman’s Director, Leffel’s exhibition opened a month after the closing of Andy Warhol: Life and Legends, a show of prints that have a nearly antithetical set of values from Leffel’s. The bookending of the two shows—a carefully considered juxtaposition—was a stroke of brilliance on the part of Michael Zakian, who offered his audience the opportunity to witness two wildly divergent artistic careers that also have some subtle connections and overlaps.Warhol and his art are widely known, but Zakian, who is the author of a new book on Leffel—David A. Leffel: The Mastery of Light— makes a strong argument that Leffel also deserves his moment in the spotlight: “Today he (David Leffel) stands as one of the founders of the contemporary realist art movement,” Zakian writes in the book’s introduction, “and as someone whose work is revered throughout the nation and beyond.” If you value art that comments on the era in which it was made you are likely going to always prefer Warhol, but if you value the idea of painting as a long, deep conversation with tradition, then Zakian has a point to make. Born within three years of each other—Warhol in 1928, Leffel in 1931—both were the sons of Eastern European immigrant families, both dealt with difficult childhood illnesses and both began their careers as commercial artists. Leffel’s differences from Warhol—his adherence to Old Master techniques and subjects, his commitment to skill and his disconnect from contemporary culture—are what make his retrospective both challenging and perplexing. Leffel’s retrospective offered, at it’s best, the chance to see paintings by an artist whose mesmerizing command of technique has taken decades to develop. The exhibition’s weakness, which is that Leffel’s work is so doggedly rooted in past traditions and idioms, is directly interwoven with its strengths.Two Self-Portraits Leffel made in the late 1950s, when he began to pursue painting seriously, show how in the course of a single year he veered from the influence of a Modernist (Modigliani) towards an Old Master (Rembrandt), a change in course that he has never looked back from. Leffel’s paintings have, for more than five decades, maintained a conversation with Rembrandt, so much so that it is tempting to dismiss Leffel as an epigone, the less-distinguished follower of a much-venerated master. Leffel’s paintings have Rembrandt-style lighting—strong directional lighting with cast shadows and reflections—and the flickering impasto of their surfaces is very much an homage to the Dutch Master’s varied and incomparable brushwork. When applied to a portrait that needs to emanate dignity—as in his portrait Tony Reyna, a revered member of the Taos community—Leffel’s neo-Baroque lighting offers the necessary solemnity. WIth its soft edges and sensitive attention to lighting, color and brushwork, this painting exemplifies Leffel’s laudable capabilities as a portraitist. Some other works in the Weisman Museum show—for example a wedding portrait rocker of John Cougar Mellencamp and his bride—lack the sense of purpose and clarity of mood present in the Reyna portrait. The Wedding comes across as a pastiche with an indefinite mood. Leffel’s best works are his recent still life paintings. In these works, Leffel’s acute sense of materiality and his ability to manipulate oil paint come on strong, allowing him to achieve strikingly tender effects of space and surface. Leffel’s still lifes, seen at close hand, have a genuine poetry and revelatory visual power. Seeing the insistent abstractness of Leffel’s brushwork in person offers up some compelling questions about how representational painting works now and how it worked in the past. His brushwork is, simply put, masterful. “When I am completely by myself in the studio,” writes Leffel, “in a state of attentive waiting—to paint, to learn—there is a great sense of being alone but not isolated.” Leffel’s deep connections to the art of the past challenge the powerful notion that art must be married to “progress.” He and his art find connection in a kind of beauty that most contemporary artists no longer acknowledge. If you don’t care for Leffel’s work, or for his orientation, you can at least think of him as beautifully, even gloriously, out of touch.David Leffel believes that painting is something messy you do with brushes in your hands, an idea that Andy Warhol once walked away from, smiling all the way to the bank.

His landmark achievements include Obamacare, abolishing DOMA, and the obvious - becoming the first black president of the United States. Seldom discussed, however, is the illustrious legacy First Lady Michelle Obama has established.Michelle Obama is arguably the most accomplished first lady ever. More accomplished than Jackie Kennedy, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush, Laura Bush, and yes, Hillary Clinton.Two Ivy League degrees aside (Princeton & Harvard Law), Mrs. Obama has served as the Associate Dean of Students at the University of Chicago, and Vice President of Community & External Affairs at the University of Chicago Medical Center, before becoming one of the most beloved first ladies in US history.#Flotus implemented the insanely popular Let’s Move! campaign, as well as the Joining Forces military program, Reach Higher educational co-op, and the Let Girls Learn global initiative - all while making #Flotus, a household hashtag. Mrs. Obama has touched millions of lives in ways many elected officials only dream, while simultaneously shattering antiquated notions of the typical housewife. She remains present and engaged as a mother, and continues to be an inspiration to parents worldwide. She is an equal-partner in every sense, who enthusiastically supports her spouse’s goals as her own; and she does so without diminishing her greatness or compromising her ambition.To understand the magnitude of the first lady’s influence, one simply needs to recall the timely, heartfelt, emphatic speech delivered during the 2016 Democratic National Convention. As the convention hall watched in awe, Mrs. Obama gave an address that has been considered, “one of the three greatest convention speeches” in political history. Mrs. Obama spoke candidly about the issues troubling America today, touching on gun violence, equal rights, and race relations. At one point, she reflected on the sensitive subject of slavery, stating:“That is the story of this country...the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today, I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my daughters - two beautiful, intelligent, black young women - playing with their dogs on the White House lawn.”She spoke with conviction and authority, in a tone that quelled, calmed, and ultimately healed the tumultuous convention hall. More than 26 million viewers tuned in nationally, and according to several reports, those who watched were noticeably moved.Atmosphere Inside the HallIt is important to note earlier in the day, Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, stepped down amid allegations corroborated by emails leaked to Wikileaks.The Sanders campaign previously raised concerns over a biased national committee in December 2015, when it accused the DNC of tipping the scales in favor of Sec. Hillary Clinton. The leaked emails appear to support Sanders’ original claims. Needless to say, Sanders supporters weren’t satisfied with just the resignation of Schultz, especially after the Clinton campaign released a statement hours later announcing Schultz would “continue” as a campaign surrogate. If the timing of the statement wasn’t odd, the Clinton campaign’s choice of words certainly were. How does a recently removed chair of a national party, whose position, by definition, was expected to be neutral and unbiased, continue as a campaign surrogate? Hence, Sanders loyalists’ major gripe. Many Sanders delegates lobbied for harsher consequences and supported the idea of a contested convention. Delegates on both sides were observed heckling, shouting, and pushing. The overall atmosphere in the hall was one of animosity and division.Then the First Lady Took StageThe atmosphere in the hall had grown so tense that both campaigns were forced to distribute texts to staff members and delegates to discourage public confrontations. Mrs. Obama was well aware of the political climate inside the hall prior to her speech, and seemed to understand better than anyone the possible implications of her remarks.The first lady began as most speakers do, giving warm salutations. Then she quickly appealed to the audience’s sense of nostalgia, reminding the country where it was seven years prior, and highlighting the progress the Obama administration has made. She reminded Americans of the president’s responsibility to guide, influence, and empower the next generation of leaders, a demeanor she suggested Donald Trump lacks. Drawing on her executive experience as an organizational leader, lawyer, and public speaker, she persuasively argued how many social issues transcend politics. Issues such as education, health care, women’s rights, and racial inequality. She spoke about the concerns she has for her daughters, and children in general, and did so in a way that resonated with every parent in the arena. She also spoke of the challenges she and her family have faced as the first black family, and did so with exceptional grace, style, and unforgettable class. As she delivered her historic address, America watched knowing it was witnessing history. The most memorable moment of the address came midway through, when Mrs. Obama described the challenges of public life and its effect on her daughters. She spoke about the unwarranted, bizarre charges from conservatives, and highlighted a few of the more egregious attacks the family has endured. She likened the negativity to bullying, and encouraged onlookers to stand tall in the face of aggression, as she and her family have done through the years. She shared a philosophy her family adopted early on, which was simple, yet powerful; “when they go low, we go high.” The hall erupted, and a queen was crowned.A beautiful, intelligent, confident queen, from Chicago’s South Side."

Hiddleston answered the question by saying everything and nothing at the same time.“We all live in a world where every phone has a camera and there’s nothing new, really, about the spotlight on me; I think that’s what happens when you’re a public figure,” he said. “I’ve learned that there are many sides to a story, and that sometimes there are a lot of stories out there which are false, and the hardest thing is to try to not let those falsehoods affect your own life. That’s what I would say.”Does that mean there are more sides to the Hiddleswift story? Is this his way of telling us, again, that he and Tay are in it for real? Will we ever know? Probably not. "
23,BUSINESS,8 Ways To Get People To Take You More Seriously,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/8-ways-to-get-people-to-t_b_11479496.html,"If you really want to be taken more seriously at work, you should start by looking in the mirror and doing what you can to increase your influence.",2016-08-14,2016-08-12-1471031195-7430071-8WaysToGetPeopleToTakeYouMoreSeriouslyHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-08-12-1471031195-7430071-8WaysToGetPeopleToTakeYouMoreSeriouslyHP-thumb.jpg,"Do you ever feel like nobody takes you seriously at work? If so, you're not alone. More than 50% of people don't feel respected at work, according to a global survey of more than 20,000 employees by the Harvard Business Review.Maybe colleagues ignore your input in meetings. Perhaps they interrupt you or don't include you in important decisions. It's easy to blame that on a bad boss or a toxic work environment. In some cases, that's even true. But if you really want to be taken more seriously at work, you should start by looking in the mirror and doing what you can to increase your influence.If you want to know how you come across to others, you can learn a lot by taking an emotional intelligence test. Other than that, there are eight things you can do right now to increase your credibility, get people to take you more seriously, and ensure you get treated with the respect you deserve.1. Don't let your statements sound like questions. One of the most common things people do to undermine their credibility is end their sentences on a higher inflection than where they started. It's called ""upspeak,"" and our brains are trained to interpret that pattern as a question. So instead of delivering information, you end up sounding like you're asking if your own input is correct. 2. Don't just give reports -- tell stories. The most successful TED talks follow a magic formula -- they are 75% stories and 25% data backing up those stories. Stories provide an emotional hook that helps people remember what you said, and they give you a platform for connecting your knowledge to the real world. There's a huge difference between memorizing mathematical formulas, for example, and being able to use them to calculate whether a particularly dangerous asteroid is going to hit us in our lifetime. Stories help people take you seriously because they demonstrate that you can apply what you know.3. Encourage people to talk about themselves. When you first started dating, your mom probably encouraged you to get your dates to talk about themselves. Sure, it's good manners -- and we all know that everybody likes to talk about themselves. But it turns out that there's a scientific basis for this. Your brain rewards you for self-disclosure. In fact, talking about yourself feels so good that it causes neurological changes in the brain. So if you want people to pay attention to what you have to say, let them talk about themselves first. Once those ""feel-good"" neurotransmitters are flowing and people start feeling connected to you, they're much more likely to take you and your contributions seriously.4. Do your homework. One of the best ways to get people to take you seriously is to be prepared and know what you're talking about. Americans attend 11 million meetings every day, and unproductive meetings cost the US economy $37 billion every year. Why are there so many unproductive meetings? Because people are unprepared. Don't be one of them. Whether it's a team meeting or briefing your boss, always take the time to prepare. Know what you want to say, be able to back up your opinions with data, and be prepared to answer questions two or three levels down.5. Stay informed. If you look at the employee handbook for tech company Valve, it says that it looks for ""T-shaped"" employees: people who have a lot of broad knowledge layered on top of their primary area of expertise. Do whatever it takes to keep up with what's going on in the world. It's particularly important to stay abreast of trends in science and technology, especially as they relate to business. You don't want to look like a deer in the headlights when somebody starts talking about how the Internet of Things is going to transform manufacturing.6. Dress for success. Fair or not, we judge people on their appearances every single day. And it happens so fast -- in about a tenth of a millisecond, according to researchers at Princeton -- that we don't even realize we're doing it. We make inferences about a person's character and capabilities based on appearance. If your appearance is sloppy, for example, people are likely to subconsciously conclude that your work will be sloppy too. Looking polished and well-groomed, on the other hand, creates the impression of responsibility and competence. That doesn't mean you have to rush out and blow your budget on a designer wardrobe. But it does mean that you should show enough respect for yourself and for your colleagues to make a substantial effort.7. Strike a power pose. If you assume an expansive pose -- taking up more room by keeping your shoulders open and your arms wide -- other people see you as more powerful. This is a hard-wired human characteristic, as people who have been blind since birth throw their arms out in victory, even though they've never seen someone do this. Moreover, power poses actually change our body chemistry. Researchers at Harvard found that after participants held a power pose for just two minutes, their levels of testosterone rose by 20% and their cortisol (the stress hormone) levels dropped. Power poses are a win-win: they make other people see you as more powerful, and they actually make you feel more powerful.8. Be confident but not too confident. No one is going to have confidence in you until you have confidence in yourself. But you have to balance that confidence with a little humility. Truly confident people aren't afraid to admit that they don't know everything -- it doesn't make them feel threatened at all. In fact, the most confident people are eager to ask questions and learn. The best way to show your confidence is to own what you know and what you don't.  Bringing It All TogetherIf you feel like you don't get the respect you deserve at work, nobody can change that but you. Sometimes people don't take you seriously because of little things that you don't even realize you're doing. And that's something you can fix.What do people do that makes it hard to take them seriously? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

In fact, several UN officials have readily commented on racial and other violence in the United States as well as the conditions of blacks in the country.As reported globally and partly captured on video in July, the capital of Louisiana suffered the shooting deaths of three police officers and the death of a man selling CDs at a convenience store parking lot, all within two weeks. Both episodes and other killings last month of black men and police officers jolted the US into a deep examination of how violent race relations had become in the country.Slim, whose real name is Arthur Reed, lives in Baton Rouge -- the city's South Side, to be exact -- where he runs a nonprofit group, Stop the Killing, recording violence in the area to show in schools, churches and other community settings to educate people on injustices that may not get much scrutiny.His goal is to stop street violence and other ""senseless killings,"" he said in a phone interview after the Baton Rouge killings, by diverting young men and women away from criminal and self-destructive behaviors through building self-esteem.Slim, who is 43, knows well a violent life. He was a gang member and drug user who tried to commit suicide and served years in prison before he turned around and found a lifesaving cause: antiviolence. He grew up in Baton Rouge in the ""depressed neighborhood between Beauregard Town and the North Gates of LSU,"" or Louisiana State University. By age 14, he was locked up for two counts of attempted second-degree murder. Years later, after surviving a near-fatal car accident, he said he heard God speak, ""I just brought you out of that, now what are going to do for me?""He opened Stop the Killing, where he tries to educate the community on nonviolence. His new civic venture is to increase awareness of the July 5 deadly shooting by Baton Rouge police of Alton Sterling, a black man who sold CDs in front of the Triple S convenience store. The night of his death, police reported they had been responding to a call that a man was seen in the vicinity wielding a gun. Sterling was apprehended and pinned to the ground by two white officers and shot instantly. Whether he carried a gun has not been fully established.The US Justice Department announced soon after the death, recorded on video by Slim and the store owner, that it would investigate the killing. Slim's video set off a street protest, which remained calm, in the city the next day.More violence in Baton Rouge ensued: on July 17, two days after Sterling's funeral, three local police officers were killed and five others were wounded on a strip mall. Louisiana officials labeled it an ""ambush"" by Gavin Long, a lone gunman and ex-Marine apparently intent on executing police. He was from Kansas City, Mo., and had brandished an assault rifle that Sunday morning before he fired at police and was shot in the gun battle.The two incidents preceded by mere days the killing of a black man by police in Minnesota and then five police officers shot in Dallas by a black sniper. Yet the racially charged and retaliatory episodes were also interspersed with peaceful street protests, making neat summaries difficult.As Teju Cole, a photography critic for The New York Times, wrote about the Baton Rouge incidents: ""Rightful protests against murder are not to blame for other murders.""After Sterling's funeral on July 15 in Baton Rouge, Slim surprisingly invoked the UN in an impromptu video interview (the day before the Baton Rouge police officers were killed).Speaking in the video, which surfaced on Twitter, Slim said that he hoped that the UN would look at Sterling's death and see America's ""hypocrisy"" for sending ""the same young men"" to fight for democracy elsewhere but denying them democracy at home.""America has very persuasive power in the UN,"" Slim said in a later phone interview, noting that his country addresses inhumane conditions and humanitarian needs elsewhere, but not necessarily, he added, at home.Slim was most likely unaware that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesman had eagerly addressed the issue of the violent, racial deaths that occurred in July in the US, when the spokesman answered a question from a reporter.The reporter's question said, in part, ""two African‑Americans have been, in a very high‑profile way, killed, Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana. One was captured on film, the whole incident. And I wanted to know, although these might seem to be disparate incidents . . . what does the Secretary‑General think, if the United States has enough protections for particularly members of minority or other groups . . . being shot by the police?""Ban's spokesman, Stepháne Dujarric, said to the reporter: ""First of all, our condolences go to the families of the victims involved in both shootings. I think anybody who's seen the videos, they are extremely disturbing to say the least, and we would hope that each of these cases are investigated thoroughly in order to find out what happened and also to establish if there is, in fact, any pattern.""Dujarric said that Ban also condemned the sniper deaths of the five police officers in Dallas, adding that the violence in the US ""has put the focus on the need to address discrimination, including racial disparities in law enforcement, in a comprehensive approach.""Several ambassadors who represent their countries on the UN Security Council -- namely China, Malaysia and Venezuela, each experiencing varying degrees of tension with the US -- said in brief questioning that the topic of racial discrimination or racial violence in America has not come up in council meetings. The countries vehemently agreed that the topic should come up.The UN's leading human-rights advocate weighed in two months ago about discriminatory gun attacks in the US.In June, after the killing of 49 people by a gunman in a gay nightclub in Florida, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, urged US leaders to live up to its obligations to protect its citizens from the ""horrifyingly commonplace but preventable violent attacks that are the direct result of insufficient gun control.""In addition, a UN human-rights expert, Ricardo A. Sunga III, who heads the UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, said after the deaths of Philando Castile in Minnesota, Sterling and the Dallas police officers: ""The Working Group is outraged and strongly condemns the new police killings of two African-American men. These killings which were captured on video cannot be ignored. We call for prompt independent investigations to ensure the perpetrators are prosecuted and punished.""We also condemn the attacks on police officers in Dallas and call for the perpetrators to be held accountable. Excessive use of force by the police against African Americans in the United States is a regular occurrence. African Americans are reportedly shot at more than twice the rate of white people.""In January 2016, the working group released its findings from a mission to the US to assess the situation of African-Americans and people of African descent regarding racism, racial discrimination, Afrophobia, xenophobia and related intolerance. The group said in its report, ""The United States is still a long way away from dealing with the systemic and institutionalised racial discrimination that plagues it on all levels.""Conditions for blacks in the US, despite major advances, remain unequal compared with whites. The Lancet said in a July editorial that some well-being indicators of blacks have improved in the last decades, like better health care coverage, but ""little movement has been made in reducing the number of black children from impoverished backgrounds.""In 2014, compared with 12 percent of white children, 37 percent of black children lived in poverty (defined as an income of $24,008 for a family of four), The Lancet said. ""In a related metric, the percentages are similar for the stark divide in children living in food-insecure households (black, 34 percent; white, 15 percent).""Just as in 1960, issues of race, racism, and inequality are once again at the fore of the national conversation,"" it noted.Since the deaths of the Baton Rouge police officers, Slim said on the phone, his group has not been prevented from doing its video recordings by the police, yet: ""It's a funny situation to be in. We are trying to stop violence and now we're viewed as anti-police.""If he could come to New York and talk to the UN -- particularly the Security Council's 15 members -- Slim said he would tell it to ""make America rethink some of her laws, put racism on the table."""

We're already in the huge snaking queue at JFK waiting to check in when Rivka suddenly gasps 'Oh my God, I left my passport in the taxi!' Talk about life on the wild side. This is holiday Armageddon.Well, to give a shaggy dog a short back and sides, she recovers it after numerous phone calls just in time to make the flight. Once in Oslo we make straight for the National Gallery, Room 19, to admire Munch's Scream, that portrait of the ovaloid face, mouth agape, hands clapped on both ears, in the most agonised representation of terror and panic imaginable - the true MRI of my soul at JFK. MRI of my soul at JFKJapanese tourists are swarming it for selfies and poses, and we leave for a quick hop-on hop-off bus tour of the 1,000-year-old city - Royal Palace, National Theatre, parliament, and the new Opera House which is meant to represent a floating glacier - well, to each his vision.  Royal palace New opera houseThen there are the Vigeland scultpures, mid-20th century dumpy bronze nudes by Gustav Vigeland lording it in a park in all sorts of poses and exercises, including a maiden frozen in absolute frenzy (or ecstasy), tearing at her bronze tresses.The mediaeval harbourside Akershus Castle was first fortified in the late 13th century while the sturdy brick-towered green-steepled cathedral dates from the 1690s. But I know Oslo so we move on to greener pastures. BergenNearly 300 miles across the mountains on the deeply indented coast, Norway's second largest city nestles amid seven hills and seven fjords. National capital before Oslo, Bergen was a major member of the Hanseatic League that joined it in trade with German cities, as evidenced by the Bryggen (wharf) quarter of restored gabled wooden buildings that for 400 years housed German traders - now a UNESCO World Heritage site.If you approach from the sea, the green spires of ancient churches poke evocatively above the red roofs of the delightful cobble-stoned old town.In the very heart of the old town the small 12th century cathedral with its squat tower and triple-tiered green spire barely lords it over the winding lanes.Slightly further afield the twin towers of St. Mary's Church, Bergen's oldest building dating from the 1130s, raises its gaunt twin-towered facade on a hill, more imposing, yet less picturesque. The harbour entrance is guarded by Bergenhus fortress, one of Norway's oldest, with the keep and Haakon's Hall dating from the mid-13th century, though the roof of the latter was blown off in a munitions ship explosion in 1944. The Rosenkrantz Tower was built in the mid-16th century by the eponymous then governor.You can top all this by taking the Fløibanen funicular on its 26-degree-gradient, 1,000-foot ascent to the top of Mt. Fløyen for a superb panoramic overview.TrondheimOlder than either Oslo or Bergen, Trondheim has a magnificent gothic-romanesque cathedral, the world's northernmost, and Scandinavia's largest mediaeval building, dating from the mid-12th century. Its tall green spire dominates the old town and its huge facade swarms with multiple statues of Biblical figures, Christian saints, and Norwegian kings and bishops, though these are early 20th century additions, copies of mediaeval originals, following the cathedral's repeated gutting by fire through the centuries.Within, the altar reposes over the original tomb of St. Olaf - King Olaf II who deposed Thor, Odin and their pantheon of Nordic gods by introducing Christianity in the early 11th century and became Norway's patron saint. He was killed at the battle of Stiklestad on July 29, 1030. Olaf's body disappeared from its eternal resting place sometime in the 16th century and nobody knows where it now is. But a few years ago St. Olaf's Catholic Church in Oslo reported that a relic leg bone in its possession was that of the dearly departed saint. Apart from appropriate carbon dating, the limb is unusually large and the king's nickname was Olaf Digerbein - Olaf Huge Legs. Norway's third largest city and its first capital, 250 miles north of Oslo, the town sits at the confluence of the Nid River and Trondheim fjord, hence its earlier name of Nidaros, Mouth of the Nid River, the cathedral's name too. There's also a large music museum founded in the last century at Ringve Farm by a rich industrialist's widow who had no children, so she mothered musical instruments instead. The pastoral views therefrom are splendid.StavangerOn its own network of fjords 120 miles south of Bergen, Norway's fourth largest city once thrived on herring fishing, until the herrings ran out. Now it's the country's oil capital thanks to the oleaginous North Sea, providing servicing for off-shore rigs. Its green steepled cathedral tops a hillock, with the harbour on one side and a pretty park with a swan-filled lake on the other. Dating from 1125, the approximate date of Stavanger's founding, it's said to be the oldest mediaeval cathedral in Norway still in its original form. On the harbour's western side, the picturesque old town rises on a slope with late 18th century white wooden houses lining its narrow cobble-stoned lanes. The harbour itself, with wall-to-wall terraced bars and restaurants, is a pleasant rest stop.Except, that is, when it's virtually blotted out by huge multi-storeyed cruise ships.  KristiansandAt the country's southern tip, Norway's fifth largest city prides itself as 'Norway's No. 1 Holiday Resort' with accommodation prices to match.This sends me running to the Budget Hotel of which Lonely Planet declaims: 'We wouldn't normally recommend a place nestled in a car park between an overpass and the train station, and even less one that from the outside resembles a bunch of cargo containers on top of one another, but Kristiansand's pricey accommodation scene makes this good budget value...' Now I know cargo containers, cargo containers are friends of mine and these are no cargo containers. They're more like windowed garden sheds piled two high. After handing over $123 for two nights, I'm handed sheets, pillow case and towel and told to go upstairs and make my own bed. But I'm informed that I don't have to unmake the bed on departure. The room does have a shower and loo.The town is pleasant, with an early 19th century quarter of white wooden houses that survived a massive fire in 1892, fine for a peaceful, evocative walk-about. There's also a late 19th century cathedral with a tall green spire, and a round little fort built in the mid-17th century for protection against pirates and other naughty Scandinavians. The people here, as everywhere in Norway, are of all colours thanks to the country's up-to-now commendably noble attitude towards refugees and migrants. Hail a taxi in the larger towns and you might think you're back in New York - Indian drivers dominate here too. There are also many Asian restaurants.

30,THE WORLDPOST,"Fidel Castro Thanks Cubans, Slams Obama On 90th Birthday","Sarah Marsh, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fidel-castro-turns-90_us_57af789fe4b071840411a4e8,Thousands of Cubans danced in the streets to celebrate the former leader's birthday.,2016-08-13,Thousands of Cubans danced to Latin beats to celebrate Castro's 90th birthday on Saturday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57af7cc51700002c00d1e967.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Fidel Castro thanked Cubans for their tributes to mark his 90th birthday on Saturday in a meandering column carried by state-run media in which the iconic leftist revolutionary also lambasted old foe United States.Cuba went into overdrive this month honoring the retired “El Comandante” who spearheaded its 1959 revolution and built a Communist-run state on the doorstep of the United States, surviving what it says were hundreds of assassination attempts along the way.Thousands danced to Latin beats along Havana’s curving seafront Malecon boulevard throughout the night from Friday to Saturday. It was a giant street party in his honor, with a live band playing “Happy Birthday” on the stroke of midnight and fireworks exploding on the other side of the bay.“I want to express my most profound gratitude for the shows of respect, the greetings and gifts I have received the days, which give me the strength to reciprocate through ideas,” Castro wrote in the opinion piece.Castro, who handed power to his younger brother Raul in 2008 due to poor health, went on to reminisce about his youth as a child on the family plantation in the eastern village of Biran, in particular about his father who died before the revolution.“He suffered quite a bit,” Castro wrote. “Of his three male children, the second and third were absent and distant, both fulfilling their duty in revolutionary activities.”Even back then, Fidel wrote, he knew Raul should replace him if anything should happen to him, in particular if the United States succeeded in its attempts to kill him.“I almost laughed about the Machiavellian plans of the U.S. presidents,” he wrote.True to form, Castro went on to lambast Barack Obama, this time for the U.S. president’s speech in May when he visited Hiroshima, site of the world’s first atomic bombing at the end of World War Two.“He lacked the words to ask for forgiveness for the killings of hundreds of thousands of people,” Castro wrote.In his last opinion piece, in March, the “Historic Leader” accused Obama of sweet-talking the Cuban people during his visit to the island - the first by a U.S. leader in 88 years - and of ignoring the accomplishments of Communist rule.Many Cubans feel Fidel is no longer in step with the times. Raul’s most broadly feted accomplishment since taking power has been implementing a detente with the United States after a half century of frozen confrontation.Considered more pragmatic, the younger Castro also introduced market-style reforms to invigorate the state-dominated economy and increased personal freedoms, such as the right to travel abroad. Fidel has lent these policies only lukewarm support in public.Still, that didn’t stop tributes to Fidel flooding in on the occasion of his birthday, ranging from the conventional, such as photo exhibits about his life, to the outlandish, with one cigar maker rolling the longest smoke in the world, measuring 90 meters (295 feet), in Fidel’s honor.Indeed, regardless of the present, many Cubans continue to revere Fidel for having freed Cuba from U.S. domination and introduced universal, free healthcare and education.“Fidel is the best thing that happened to our country,” said Aldo Zamora, 40, selling candy-colored balloon animals at the street party along the Malecon, as a tropical electric storm lit up the night sky.(Additional reporting by Nelson Acosta; Editing by Mark Heinrich)"

WADA immediately locked Ms. Stepanova’s account to prevent further access and notified her of the situation,” WADA said.“A subsequent investigation by WADA allowed the Agency to determine that no other athlete accounts on ADAMS have been accessed.”All athletes have to enter their details into ADAMS and register a time and location each day when and where they can be reached by doping testers in case of an out-of-competition test.Stepanova, praised by the international athletics body (IAAF) for her courage in stepping forward and revealing details on widespread doping in Russia, is still an active athlete and had attempted to compete in Rio.The International Olympic Committee, however, refused to admit her as a neutral athlete, as proposed by the IAAF.WADA said the incident came just days after what it said was “an alleged hack” of their website with some users receiving e-mails that looked as if they came from WADA urging them to enter their credentials.“WADA quickly investigated and immediately sent an e-mail to all ADAMS users, including a warning banner on the ADAMS home page, alerting them to these e-mails, which WADA would never send, and asking them to advise ADAMS support immediately if they were to receive such an e-mail.”"

The ban will be in place to the end of August. It’s unclear if it will extend after that.“This is just an Islamophobic attack on Muslim women in Cannes,” Aysha Ziaddun, a British Muslim woman, told the BBC on Saturday. “The burkini allows me the freedom to swim and go on the beach, and I don’t feel I am compromising my beliefs for that … How is a woman on a beach swimming in a wetsuit with her head covered a symbol of Islamic extremism?”It’s a good question, and one that officials in the two French Riviera towns haven’t really explained. It’s absurd and statistically unsound to conflate peaceful Muslims with terrorists. And critics point out that banning burkini-wearing women from the beach isn’t going to squash any burgeoning “extremism” in France, it’s just going to isolate them from the wider community.“People are always complaining that Muslims should integrate more, but when we join you for a swim that’s not right either,” Maryam Oiles told the BBC.French organizations fighting against racism and Islamophobia have slammed the ordinance for being likely to inflame tensions between France’s Muslim community, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports. And France’s Socialist Party has said this kind of rule would “play into the hands of religious fundamentalists.”Not all women who opt to wear burkinis are Muslim. Some Orthodox Jewish women have written about wearing burkinis or similar items of clothing while swimming in order to keep in line with their beliefs. Other women may simply feel more comfortable not exposing their bodies. Even British celebrity chef Nigella Lawson has been photographed wearing a burkini to the beach.Lisnard also made a dubious claim that the rule was instated for the women’s benefit.“If a woman goes swimming in a burkini, that could draw a crowd and disrupt public order,” the Cannes mayor told a French newspaper, as translated by The New York Times. “It is precisely to protect these women that I took this decision.”In other words, Lisnard seems to subscribe to the sexist idea that the best way to “protect” women is to place restrictions on what they can and can’t do — instead of focusing on preventing other people from harassing or hurting them.And if drawing a crowd and “disrupting public order” is really Lisnard’s main concern, we’re presuming he will also be prohibiting any celebrities from appearing publicly in Cannes."

The cantonal police did not respond to a request for further information by email and could not be reached by phone.The attack occurred at 2:20 p.m. (1220 GMT) as the train neared the Salez station on a trip between Buchs and Sennwald in St. Gallen, a canton in the northeast of the Alpine republic, the police statement said.It was the first attack of its kind in Switzerland in recent memory.

The liquid caught fire,” the statement said.Authorities did not yet know the motive for the attacks but a crime of passion was one possibility, Bruno Metzger of the St Gallen cantonal police said in an interview with welt.de.“A terrorism background still seems very, very far-fetched,” Metzger said.The assailant was in police custody, he said, but none of those injured - including the assailant - was responsive, so they could not be questioned.The police said a criminal inquiry was under way.Both a woman and the attacker were in critical condition, according to Swiss broadcaster SRF, citing the St Gallen police. The cantonal police did not respond to a request for further information by email and could not be reached by phone.The attack occurred at 2:20 p.m. (1220 GMT) as the train neared the Salez station on a trip between Buchs and Sennwald in St. Gallen, a canton in the northeast of the Alpine republic, the police statement said.It was the first attack of its kind in Switzerland in recent memory. In December 2015, a 33-year-old Swiss man broke into his neighbors’ house in Rupperswil and killed four people before setting the house on fire, an incident that shocked the country.(Additional reporting by Michael Shields, editing by Larry King)"
