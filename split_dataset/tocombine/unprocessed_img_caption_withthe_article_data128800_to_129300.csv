0,FOOD & DRINK,Now You Can Eat A 10-Course Meal Designed To Pair Exclusively With Radiohead's 'Kid-A',Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/radiohead-kid-a-meal-tasting-menu-detroit_us_5b9dddf0e4b03a1dcc8def83,"Finally, we have the answer to a burning question for Radiohead fans: What should I eat while listening to ""Kid A""?",2014-02-14,"Radiohead band members, from left, Ed O'Brien, guitar, Jonny Greenwood, lead guitar, Colin Greenwood, bass guitar, Thom Yorke, lead vocalist, and drummer Phil Selwayan pose in their hotel room, Tuesday, May 13, 2008, in Washington.

Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dddf02500003200369fd3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Finally, we have the answer to a burning question for Radiohead fans: What should I eat while listening to ""Kid A""?Next week, a Detroit chef and sommelier will offer a 10-course tasting menu for one night only. Each course pairs with a track from the 2000 Radiohead album, which will play uninterrupted throughout the meal. Kyle Hanley, chef de cuisine at the Detroit Golf Club, is creating the dinner, which includes dishes like lamb chops with crispy pig ear and blood orange reduction. Joseph Allerton chose the wine and cocktails, listening only to ""Kid A"" to make his pairings rather than considering the food choices. He is the food and beverage director at Michael Symon restaurant Roast and previously served as its sommelier. Hanley said he studied music before becoming a chef. When he listens to it, he hears ""textures and colors,"" which makes it natural for him to associate it with food. ""Especially Radiohead, they are very textural. They are a very visceral band,"" he told HuffPost. Hanley said he's telling servers to think of themselves as stagehands at a performance so they don't distract from the listening experience. ""Most people put out CDs, and this is an actual album. One song flows into the next, and we kind of want to do the same thing with the courses,"" he said.Hanley and Allerton are not the first to make the connection that food and music can be better together. On the ""Food is the New Rock"" podcast, the hosts talk to musicians about food and chefs about music, and the crossovers between the two. Turntable Kitchen pairs recipes with albums and curates pairings boxes for subscribers. In Detroit, a recurring dining series pairs brunch with noise music. Some might wonder if the subtleties of Hanley and Allerton's ""Kid A"" pairings would be lost on diners who aren't experts in both food and music. But Hanley said listening to excellent music or eating a delicious meal are experiences that leave you with a lasting emotion, and it only makes sense to put them together. ""If you like the album, if you like the music, you'll get it.""Hanley and his business partner Bill Keros (of classic Detroit restaurant Lafayette Coney Island) are considering turning the event into a series and throwing monthly dinners paired with different albums. For now, they're starting with the ""Kid A"" meal and only selling 36 tickets, but those who can't attend can try to imagine each dish while listening to the 10 tracks below. See the full menu on the Facebook event page. The meal is being served in three seatings at the Elizabeth Theater in Detroit on Weds., Feb. 19. See the Facebook page for more details. "
1,FOOD & DRINK,Pizza Hut Sets Up OkCupid Profile To Win The Hearts Of Millennials,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pizza-hut-ok-cupid_us_5b9dde16e4b03a1dcc8df0ec,Looking for love this Valentine's Day? So is Pizza Hut.,2014-02-14,"Pizza Hut's Stuffed Crust Pizza, graphic element on black",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dde163c00004c000a507f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Valentine's Day is one of those polarizing holidays that people love to hate. This year, however, one restaurant chain is doing its part to unite people with a common denominator that everyone can get behind: pizza. Just in time for Valentine's Day, Pizza Hut has set up an online dating profile on OkCupid to find ""the one,"" ABC News reports.Pizza Hut's profile describes itself as 55 years old and ""tall enough."" It also has a ""Ph.D in Delicious"" and its job is ""delivering."" The chain is ""looking for someone who brings outrageous enthusiasm to the everyday moments; the one with a zany sense of adventure and a rad personality."" (Not sure that sounds like a 55-year-old, but then again, we've never dated a restaurant before.)The chain is soliciting ideas for the best marriage proposal, and will choose three finalists to visit its headquarters in Plano, Texas, to face off, and hopefully eat a lot of pizza. The winner walks away with a lifetime of pizza (or, according to the fine print, a check for $4,800, TIME reports.) The contest runs until February 21.Pizza Hut partnered with OkCupid because both companies are trying to reach millennials, Courtney Moscovic, a spokeswoman for Pizza Hut, told ABC News. The restaurant chain has also started to offer pizza by the slice, as part of this broader initiative to target 20- and 30-year-olds. Pizza Hut is the first company to set up an online dating profile, ABC News reports. Do you think this will become a trend? What company would you want to date? Regardless of whether or not more companies enter the dating game, Pizza Hut has confirmed something we already knew deep down: Pizza is the only valentine you need.[h/t ABC News]Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

2,WELLNESS,A Cancer Love Story,"Paige Davis, Contributor
Entrepreneur, writer, mind-body enthusiast, cancer survivor, a...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cancer_us_5b9ddd1ae4b03a1dcc8de3a7,"As grateful as I am for my year with cancer, I'm even more grateful this chapter has come to a close.",2014-02-14,2014-02-13-PaigeDavis_Session1_080612_051_web.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-02-13-PaigeDavis_Session1_080612_051_web-thumb.jpeg,"I have a confession. I'm so grateful I got cancer. There, I said it. It's confusing to confess something so morbid, but as my year cancerversary (Feb. 14) makes its mark, I realize that despite the pain, poking, prodding, and discomfort, this year was perhaps one of the most important of my life. Difficult -- yes. Meaningful -- absolutely. Upon the moment of my diagnosis, I knew this would be a year of transformation and transmutation. I was not naive to the barbaric nature of what I knew of the disease and possible treatments but chose to see it as a love journey utilizing all of the tools in my personal growth and wellness toolkit I had acquired over the years. I encouraged friends and family to stay away from terms of battle, fight or poison and chose to see all the procedures and treatments as light and love. Naive, perhaps, but with this intention came the gift of being present and the connection to the deepest part of myself. That place where fear, judgement, anxiety, and uncertainty transmute to love, acceptance, compassion and faith. I witnessed as my ""ego,"" which appeared to control so much throughout my life was being pushed aside as my spirit, lead by surrender began to take hold. Vulnerability became the norm and grace my trusted new confidant. The juxtaposition of love vs. fear became apparent in everything I was experiencing. Early on, a dear friend and gifted photographer, Romy Suskin, said she would like to document the journey. The goal was no goal -- a first for me. My main priority was I just wanted to capture the essence of where I was in the given moment. We said we would mark the major milestones -- before my surgery (bilateral mastectomy), after the six-month chemo regimen started, and then a final session once I got the ""girls"" in. Our first session was a strange mix of serenity and panic. It was the day before I was leaving for my surgery in Houston at MD Anderson. I had just returned from my cousin's wedding, and it was a bittersweet send off, as my entire family ushered me with well wishes, while the unspoken loss of so many family members taken from cancer hovered amongst it all. I can remember feeling worried, confused, frozen. I was in uncertain territory where prognosis was not known. Our second session was in stark contrast. I was almost giddy. I had begun stripping down the layers physically and emotionally, and I was discovering an authenticity in my spirit that felt so innocent, tender, and joyful. I was awake for what felt like the first time in my life.  Our third session is yet to be scheduled. It marks the stepping forward, and I admittedly am not quite sure how to do that. But I know it starts with embracing that not knowing, honoring the unbelievable journey, and celebrating perhaps the biggest milestone to date -- that of completion of the surgeries and treatments. It means taking pause, checking in, and listening. It means forgiving myself and others when I realize that old patterns and behaviors no longer work. It means continuing to be brave and express myself even in the most vulnerable moments. It means nourishing and taking care of myself not because of the cancer, but because I love myself and deserve the best. It means letting myself shine and celebrating the milestones of life -- however monumental or miniscule. It means allowing myself and others the freedom to be who we are. It means loving and being loved. It means surrendering to it all. As grateful as I am for my year with cancer, I'm even more grateful this chapter has come to a close. I could not have done it without the unbelievable support of my family, friends and co-workers. The opportunity now exists in being able to enjoy the gifts of this past year, but without cancer as the catalyst. Sure there will be residual realizations, insights, moments of panicked symptomology, and follow-up appointments. But for the most part, the completion is here. I'm medically ""free from evidence of disease,"" and I'm proud of who I have become in the process. In many ways, it is fitting that my cancerversary falls on Valentine's Day, for it marks the ultimate love story of all -- that with myself.You can read more of Paige's life musings on her blog The Sunshine Chronicles.
