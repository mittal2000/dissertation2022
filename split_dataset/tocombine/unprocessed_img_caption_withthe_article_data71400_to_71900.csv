2,POLITICS,The Highway Bill Is Turning Into A Vehicle For Bank Favors,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/highway-bill-bank-favors_us_565cc17be4b072e9d1c2e848,A major for-profit college would also get some help.,2015-11-30,"The highway funding bill currently before Congress includes favorable provisions for banks and a for-profit college chain, sources say.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565cc30c1700008100e1ac0d.jpeg?cache=GbRyKazjS4&ops=crop_39_330_5081_2799%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Congressional negotiators working on a bipartisan highway funding bill may include a controversial provision that would undercut new mortgage rules, according to sources close to the talks.Negotiators are also discussing measures that would help a troubled for-profit college company avoid bankruptcy, as well as enable a single New York bank to sidestep a requirement in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.A highway funding bill may seem an odd vehicle for arcane financial services policy, but the riders reflect the recent reality that Congress passes very little legislation. Bipartisan bills with broad support can become incubators for unrelated and at times, highly-targeted, legislative favors. Other lawmakers and the president are reluctant to spoil a package over such provisions when bipartisan accomplishments are so rare.The highway bill would ensure years of federal funding for the nation's roads and bridges. Hardline conservative groups have opposed it, but versions of the bill have cleared both the House and Senate. Negotiators from both parties are now hammering out a final bill, and sources say three financial services riders are currently in the package, although the precise details of one measure are still being negotiated. The final legislation could, of course, change in the coming days.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included a host of new mortgage requirements designed to inoculate the banking system against future foreclosure outbreaks. Those rules include basic protections like requiring lenders to verify that a borrower has the ability to repay a loan, as well as specific measures, like barring giant ""balloon payments"" at the end of a loan.But banks that operate predominantly in rural areas are exempt from such standards. The highway bill saddles the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with a mountain of red tape in order to determine that banks do, in fact, operate in rural areas. Negotiators are even considering striking the requirement that banks be ""predominantly"" engaged in a rural area, which would open up the loophole to banks that don't even conduct rural lending.Even the gentlest version of this language could hamstring the CFPB by requiring the agency to devote hordes of resources to applications from banks to qualify for rural-lender status. Under the current system, the CFPB determines that a region is rural, and any bank operating predominantly in that region automatically qualifies for the exemptions.Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has repeatedly warned Congress against slipping bank deregulation into must-pass spending bills at the end of the year. At the close of 2014, lawmakers included a provision to subsidize risky derivatives trades in a bill to avoid a government shutdown. The ensuing fight over the ""swaps push-out"" provision nearly torpedoed the overall bill, which only survived after President Barack Obama and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon personally entreated lawmakers to support it.The other bank favor in the highway bill is aimed directly at Emigrant Savings Bank of New York. The provision would enable the bank to circumvent Dodd-Frank rules against funding bank operations with excessive levels of borrowed money by changing a date used in the calculation of financial terms. Emigrant pushed its asset levels above $15 billion during the financial crisis, and Dodd-Frank has tighter rules on how much borrowed cash banks with at least $15 billion can rely on to fund their operations. The bank has since dropped below $15 billion in total assets, and wants to avoid having to raise more capital.Critics of the bill argue that banks that boost their asset levels in a crisis shouldn't get special favors when the crisis fades. But Emigrant Bank Chairman Howard Milstein was a 2008 Obama bundler, and has long been influential in New York politics. The provision was originally authored several years ago by former Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.), who later pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud and resigned.Highway bill negotiators are also on track to approve changes to the Franklin D. Roosevelt-era Trust Indenture Act that would help troubled for-profit college operator Education Management Corporation avoid bankruptcy. As of 2014, over 112,000 students were enrolled at EDMC schools such as Argosy University, Brown Mackie College, South University and a series of Art Institutes in different cities. A 2012 report from the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee found that more than 62 percent of students enrolled in EDMC schools in 2008 and 2009 had withdrawn by mid-2010. Students who withdrew were only enrolled for a median of four months.As a result, huge numbers of EDMC students were saddled with hefty student loan debt without receiving a degree. Many consumer advocates have long accused the for-profit college industry of preying on both students and taxpayers, since the government backs many student loans.

So there was no question that Major League Baseball was trying to expand roles for women, too, the president of Minor League Baseball told The Huffington Post in September.""Somewhere, somebody is trying to figure out how we're going to get the first female [general manager], the first female coach,"" Pat O'Conner said at the time. ""I can tell you it's a priority -- diversity from all angles.""Still, there wasn't much optimism -- from O'Conner or others who had tracked the history of women in baseball -- that change would happen soon.But a few weeks later, the moment came: The Oakland A's hired Justine Siegal, a former collegiate and independent league coach, to work the fall instructional league in Arizona. Siegal was the first woman ever hired to coach for an MLB franchise, and even if it was only for the short fall season, which gives minor leaguers a chance to put in extra work before the winter, it was progress.""This has been a wonderful moment and a long-deserved moment in history when women are getting their chance to coach in professional sports,"" Siegal told HuffPost this week. ""I think the American consciousness is ready for more females in positions of sports leadership.""For two weeks in October, Siegal began each day working with infielders, beating ground balls to Oakland’s third basemen. She threw batting practice when it was her turn in the rotation and took her familiar spot coaching first base during afternoon games.It wasn’t long, she said, before everyone forgot that she was anything but another baseball coach.""I was a rookie coach, so my job was more or less to support full-time coaches. But it doesn't stop the interaction or change the interaction with the players,"" Siegal said. ""I've never felt more accepted on a baseball field. That was an incredible feeling for me.""Acceptance has been a common reaction to Siegal's work.""I've found throughout my years of coaching that if you show you know what you're doing and you care about them and can make them better players, they'll accept you,"" she said.Siegal's career has been marked by milestones. She was one of the first women to coach in college baseball. In 2009, she signed on as the first-base coach for the Brockton Rox, an independent team in Massachusetts, making her the first woman to coach in men's pro baseball. Two years later, she became the first woman to throw batting practice to a MLB team.Despite that success, ""it never crossed my mind that I'd be able to coach professionally [in the major league],"" Siegal said.Still, for the last few years, she had called around MLB front offices asking for a chance to coach in their instructional leagues. Oakland’s general manager, Billy Beane, was the first to say yes.Even before Siegal joined the A’s, 2015 had seen a number of positive signs for women in America’s pastime.Siegal, who runs a nonprofit to promote girls' baseball, brought together 12 teams from across the country in June for the first-ever national girls baseball tournament in Florida. Later that month, Melissa Mayeux, a 16-year-old French shortstop, became the first girl ever added to MLB's international prospect list, making her eligible to sign with a pro team. July's Pan American Games included women's baseball for the first time, and one of Team USA's players, Sarah Hudek, became the latest girl to earn a college baseball scholarship.In the fall, ESPN made Jess Mendoza, a former college and Olympic softball player, the first woman analyst on a national MLB playoff broadcast. That all followed the summer of Little League pitcher Mo'ne Davis a year before.""It's a tipping point for girls and women in baseball,"" Siegal said. ""I've been doing this 17 years, helping girls have a place to play. We see Mo'ne Davis, women in the Pan Am Games, that general recognition that softball and baseball are not the same sport, and that girls should be given the opportunity to change.""MLB says it has stepped up its efforts. Last year the league launched diversity initiatives that primarily targeted African-American participation but were also aimed at ""strengthening the foundation of women in our game,"" Wendy Lewis, baseball's senior vice president for diversity, inclusion and strategic alliances, said in an email before Siegal was hired.The league has never had a female general manager, a position that comes with direct power over baseball-related decisions. But it has had three female assistant GMs. Kim Ng, currently an MLB senior vice president, was a finalist for the San Diego Padres' general manager job a year ago and is often considered the likeliest candidate to finally break that ceiling.MLB also says it has increased the number of women working in its front office, and women have made strides in other roles as well. Rachel Balkovec is the St. Louis Cardinals' minor league strength coach, the first woman to ever hold that position with an MLB club. In 2011, the Los Angeles Dodgers hired Sue Falsone as the first female head athletic trainer in MLB history. The league seeks to include more women in umpire training programs, Lewis said.""We can and will do better, and that includes building a stronger pipeline at all levels of our organizations,"" Lewis said, adding that the league will host a diversity summit in 2016 aimed at connecting women and minorities who want to work in baseball with MLB and its clubs. ""We will remain diligent in providing wide-ranging opportunities for women to be a part of our game, both on and off the field.""While women are still too few and far between in baseball's highest ranks, Siegal hopes her experience will ""open more doors.""Now that her stint with the A’s is done, Siegal is pursuing her own mission outside the ranks of men's baseball. Next year, she wants to launch the Dreamcatchers, a women's pro baseball team that would play at Doubleday Field in Cooperstown, New York, the home of the Baseball Hall of Fame. There are currently no other women’s pro teams. Siegal would like eventually to see teams in minor league parks across the country, ""showcasing the women's game"" and giving girls who want to play ball ""a place to dream,"" she said.She hasn't given up on the idea of returning to Major or Minor League Baseball, either.""I'd love to continue in professional baseball,"" Siegal said, ""if that opportunity comes about.""Also on HuffPost:"

Forty-six percent want to leave, and just 1 in 3 would choose to remain in Syria, says the survey that was conducted earlier this year. Forty-three percent of the Syrians Gallup surveyed in person also said it was likely that they would leave the country in the next 12 months. Thirty-two percent of the country was not surveyed as a result of destruction, vacancy or security issues preventing pollsters from reaching people. The results are relatively unchanged from a Gallup poll conducted two years ago, which also excluded about one-third of the country, but they do represent a dramatic shift from Gallup polls conducted prior to the war, which began ramping up in 2010 and escalated in 2011. In 2008, Gallup found that 72 percent of Syrians preferred to remain in their country over an opportunity to leave. Similarly in 2009, 3 in 4 Syrians said they wanted to stay while about 1 in 5 would have opted to leave given the chance. However, as uprisings increased and eventually became a full blown civil war in 2011, that trend reversed and more Syrians than not began to express they wanted to move to another country. Of those who expressed a desire to move, 39 percent named countries in Europe as their first choice. Thirty-five percent preferred the Middle East and North Africa regions, while 10 percent preferred Asia. And though a combined majority of the world's potential migrants would prefer to emigrate to the U.S. and Canada, only 6 percent of Syrians named the countries as their first choice. Over 4 million Syrian refugees have fled the country since the start of the civil war, according to the most recent data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Fifty-one percent of Syrian refugees are children aged 17 and under. Gallup conducted face-to-face interviews with 1,002 adults aged 15 and older in January 2015 in Syria."

However, as uprisings increased and eventually became a full blown civil war in 2011, that trend reversed and more Syrians than not began to express they wanted to move to another country. Of those who expressed a desire to move, 39 percent named countries in Europe as their first choice. Thirty-five percent preferred the Middle East and North Africa regions, while 10 percent preferred Asia. And though a combined majority of the world's potential migrants would prefer to emigrate to the U.S. and Canada, only 6 percent of Syrians named the countries as their first choice. Over 4 million Syrian refugees have fled the country since the start of the civil war, according to the most recent data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Fifty-one percent of Syrian refugees are children aged 17 and under. Gallup conducted face-to-face interviews with 1,002 adults aged 15 and older in January 2015 in Syria."

Congress needs to pass the bill by Dec. 11 to avoid a shutdown.""I hear a lot of things on the omni[bus] from a lot of different aspects. I do not hear people shutting the government down over it right now,"" McCarthy said.But that doesn't mean there won't be any riders. ""How do you write a bill that’s not a continuing resolution that doesn’t have riders in it?"" the majority leader quipped. Rather than a measure on Planned Parenthood, McCarthy said, the House might instead push to attach the legislation it recently passed that seeks to ""pause"" the flow of Syrian and Iraqi refugees into the U.S. The bill adds an extra layer of security to the already lengthy refugee application process, and is opposed by the White House and a majority of Democrats. To get the legislation to the president, McCarthy hinted that Republicans might tether it to the omnibus. ""I think that bill needs to pass and become law whichever way it can,"" he said. McCarthy also indicated that the House will shift its focus slightly toward examining the visa waiver program, which the White House has said is a process that terrorists seeking to enter the U.S. could exploit more easily than the refugee program.House Republicans will meet tomorrow to discuss options for moving legislation before the end of the year that would address vulnerabilities in the visa waiver program, McCarthy said.Republicans are also mulling a separate rider that would undermine President Barack Obama's work at the Paris climate change summit, which kicked off on Monday. The Senate is actively pursuing a measure to include in the omnibus that would withhold money the administration has pledged to a United Nations fund that helps developing countries fight climate change. The measure would prevent the administration from providing the funds unless Congress receives the final say on any agreement reached in Paris.""I think as we go through towards the end of the year, inside the omni[bus] and others, I think they’ll be some big victories,"" McCarthy said of blocking money for the climate fund. Such riders have already drawn the ire of Democrats. The White House has threatened to veto the House's refugee bill and placed a high priority on the committed U.N. funds, which are meant to help developing countries battle drought, rising sea levels and other extreme climate-related weather.Also on HuffPost:"

Rice (5-7) isn't likely to get a postseason bowl bid, so after running for 54 yards and throwing a touchdown in the team's final matchup against Charlotte, Turner broke down while reflecting on his four-year career. Turner, 22, praised Rice head coach David Bailiff, who still put Turner on scholarship even after he broke his leg during his senior year of high school football, putting off most recruiters. ""Everyone sold me off,"" Turner said through tears during a postgame speech. As popularized by the movie ""Friday Night Lights,"" Turner's story could've mirrored Boobie Miles, the once sought-after 1980s high school back who lost his football career and a likely scholarship due to a leg injury. But thanks to Bailiff, Turner bucked Miles and enjoyed a full college football career, and more importantly to him, received a Rice education. “I love him forever for it. He helped me get paid for a great education that I know I’ll use very well and he let me keep playing this game that I love,"" an emotional Turner said through tears. That ""I know I'll use very well"" point Turner brought up can't be understated. It sounds like NCAA propaganda, but it's actually refreshing to hear from a student-athlete. The NCAA loves to point out the importance of a college degree when defending why athletes with scholarships aren't also paid for their work. At a July 2014 Congressional hearing, NCAA president Mark Emert cited U.S. Census statistics showing that people with a college degree earn about $1 million more over their lifetime than those without.But as multiple reports have found, college athletes are often ""clustered"" into easy majors to help them focus on the field, leaving them ill-prepared for post-graduate careers off-the-field. Suddenly, a ""free"" education becomes costly.In Turner's case, however, the Kinesiology degree that he's earning through college football's opportunity feels genuine and legitimately useful. “My experience here has been the best. That’s all I can say,"" he said.Of course, the tears said everything, really. Also on HuffPost:"
11,POLITICS,Planned Parenthood Sues To Prevent Missouri From Having Just One Abortion Clinic,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planned-parenthood-missouri_us_565c9c9de4b072e9d1c2a438,Republican state lawmakers had pressured the University of Missouri to end its relationship with the provider.,2015-11-30,Activists in New York City hold a Planned Parenthood banner to demonstrate their support for the organization.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565c9f201700008100e1ab84.jpeg?ops=crop_0_533_5000_2285%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against Missouri’s Department of Health Monday, just hours before one of two clinics in the state providing abortions would officially be barred from offering that service to its patients. The University of Missouri’s former chancellor, R. Bowen Loftin, revoked a Planned Parenthood physician's admitting privileges at the university hospital in late September, after Republican state lawmakers pressured the university to reconsider its relationship with the family planning provider. Missouri state law requires that a doctor must have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where the abortions are taking place. If the physician, Dr. Colleen McNicholas, does not acquire admitting privileges by Dec. 1, Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri's clinic in Columbia, Missouri, will no longer be licensed to provide abortions. However, the clinic will continue providing family planning, STI testing and educational programs.Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit argues that the state did not give McNicholas enough time to seek alternative privileges and did not give the Columbia clinic enough time to locate another physician to perform abortions. Planned Parenthood and its supporters at the university have called on Mizzou’s interim chancellor, Hank Foley, to either reinstate McNicholas’ privileges with the university’s hospital or extend the deadline for the doctor to acquire an alternate category of privileges.While opponents of abortion say that admitting privileges ensure a continuity of care and enhance safety, abortion rights supporters say that since complications from abortions are exceedingly rare, admitting privileges are medically unnecessary and are designed to prevent patients from obtaining abortions by forcing clinics to close. Public hospitals often refuse to offer admitting privileges because evidence shows they will be targeted by anti-abortion activists if they do. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 14 states require abortion providers to have some sort of affiliation with a local hospital.On Monday afternoon, Foley said he would not reverse the university's decision to terminate McNicholas' admitting privileges. ""I personally have given this issue much thought and have been touched by many of the emails and letters our office has received—especially those from women who have relied on Planned Parenthood for health care,"" he said in a statement.""I am sympathetic to many of the situations and extenuating circumstances these women have found themselves in—situations and circumstances that lead to decisions most women will never have to make,"" Foley added. ""However, I will continue to support the Medical Staff Executive Committee at MU Health Care. Thus, after a thorough policy review by MU Health Care, refer and follow privileges will be discontinued Dec. 1, 2015 ... The issue of abortion invokes much depth of emotion and passion; I understand this. However, as a state and federally funded university with a health system, we are required to follow applicable state and federal laws."" A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order later on Monday maintaining Planned Parenthood's license to provide abortions for two more days at its Columbia clinic. On Wednesday afternoon, the judge extended the temporary restraining order until at least Dec. 30, saying that Missouri's revocation of admitting privileges for Planned Parenthood's clinic in Columbia “may be the result of animus toward the center and the work it does there.”With the extra time, Planned Parenthood can either get an alternative category of privileges from Mizzou, obtain admitting privileges from a different hospital or find a different physician willing to perform abortions who has admitting privileges.""Mizzou and MU Healthcare failed to lead and fulfill their own mission by turning their backs on women who need access to safe, legal abortion,"" said Laura McQuade, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri.“Obtaining privileges at a hospital is a tedious, not to mention medically unnecessary requirement that can take six months, or even more, to fulfill. MU Health Care imposed an impossible timeline for our physician when it terminated Dr. McNicholas’ privileges just more than two months ago,” McQuade said. In its lawsuit, Planned Parenthood notes that when a different physician working at the Columbia clinic resigned in 2012, the state health department maintained the clinic's license for over a year, allowing the health care provider time to search for a new doctor and submit the required admitting privileges application.That process still took three years; the Columbia clinic only began to offer medication abortions in August. On a call with reporters, Planned Parenthood said it had received no explanation from the health department as to why the process was different this time.A public affairs representative from the state health department said the department does not comment on pending litigation.Planned Parenthood has accused the University of Missouri of acquiescing to political pressure from Republican state Sen. Kurt Schaefer, who has led the charge against the provider in the state.“It is deeply troubling that we continue to fight MU Health Care’s politically designed obstacle course instigated by Senator Kurt Schaefer,” McQuade said in a statement.Planned Parenthood's loss of privileges at the University of Missouri Hospital was one of the grievances student protesters presented to the school. In September, the university also ended a decades-long program that allowed medical and nursing students to train at Planned Parenthood centers.Jonathan Butler, a graduate student who went on a hunger strike to protest the actions of the university's recently-resigned president, Tim Wolfe, spoke at a rally on campus supporting Planned Parenthood on Sept. 29. He cited “Planned Parenthood services being stripped from campus” in a letter explaining why he believed the president had “disrupted the learning experience for marginalized/underrepresented students at the University of Missouri.”This story has been updated with news that a federal judge has extended Planned Parenthood's license to provide abortions at its Columbia, Missouri, clinic. The story was also updated to include a statement from the University of Missouri's interim chancellor, Hank Foley.Also on HuffPost:"

Previously, the Zurich-based bank had offered 12 weeks paid plus eight weeks unpaid leave to its 8,300 U.S. employees.The company also announced it would pay for new parents to bring a nanny with them if they had to travel for business in the first 12 months of their child's life.Competition from increasingly enlightened tech firms drove the change, said Elizabeth Donnelly, Credit Suisse's head of benefits for the Americas. ""We're no longer just competing with other financial services firms,"" she told The Huffington Post.You hear tech companies talk a lot about game-changing disruption. There are endless examples: Uber ""disrupted"" the taxi industry, Seamless made calling for pizza obsolete, Netflix changed the way we watch television. Less discussed is the way tech is starting to change and improve how new parents get treated at work -- at least at certain high-end employers.Giving employees at well-paid, white-collar jobs more maternity and paternity leave is the new hotness of 2015.The same day Credit Suisse announced it would beef up leave, Facebook said it would offer four months' paternity leave to all dads worldwide -- previously, just male employees in the U.S. had the benefit.Also this year, Netflix gave 12 months parental leave to employees that work in its streaming business. Spotify gave six months of leave to its U.S. employees. Amazon, Microsoft and Adobe also increased their leave allowances this year. In banking, Goldman Sachs increased paid maternity leave to 16 weeks, Donnelly pointed out. Most of Credit Suisse's competitors offer about 12 weeks. ""We didn't necessarily want to mimic other banks,"" she said.As for the ""gilded"" nanny perk, elite private equity firm KKR announced a similar benefit in August, as part of an effort to attract more women to the old-line firm. Only 13 percent of KKR's employees are women.Women in finance face many of the same issues as women in tech -- feeling like you've just walked in on a boys' party, etc. -- especially at the elite investing and private equity firms. While there's parity in the lower ranks in the finance industry, as you move up women start to disappear, according to data from the nonprofit women's advocacy group Catalyst. There's only one woman, out of 13 of people, heading up one Credit Suisse's regional offices in the U.S. Credit Suisse's new policy is also distinctive because it gives employees a year to take time off. All primary caregivers, including same-sex and adoptive parents, are eligible for the leave and can take it within the first year of a child's arrival. That means a man working at Credit Suisse can take 20 weeks off, after his employed spouse takes her maternity leave from her job. That's a huge win for a dual-income family -- essentially doubling the amount of time a baby gets to bond with her parents at home."

She can lift heavy stuff, sure, but only up to a point. She can jump, not fly. But her ability to survive an abusive man who controlled her every move for eight months? That’s goddamn impressive. In Netflix’s newest Marvel universe television series, ""Jessica Jones,"" we see what happens when a strong woman is controlled by an sadistic, violent man. (This whole article is one big spoiler, so readers beware). The series paints an unflinching portrayal of intimate partner violence, and the accompanying trauma that survivors must learn to live with. When we first meet Jessica Jones, it’s been a year since she escaped Kilgrave, a villain whose chilling superpower is the ability to control minds. He need only verbally suggest someone do something -- shoot themselves, leave their child on the sidewalk, toss hot coffee in their own face -- and they will do it without hesitation. For eight months, Kilgrave held Jones captive, and without her consent, acted out a romantic relationship with her. He told her what to wear, how to feel and when to smile. He raped her, again and again. And he forced her to hurt others, even compelling her to kill a woman at his behest. He exercised total control over every aspect of Jones’ life. Abusive relationships are, at their core, about control. Abusers will assert control over their partners any way they can, often employing sophisticated tactics: Manipulating their victims with mental and verbal abuse, scaring them into submission, isolating them from their communities, and ultimately convincing them that the pain and suffering is completely their own fault. Kilgrave does all of this, but through the metaphor of a superpower.A year after escaping him, Jones is still grappling with the trauma from her experience. She drinks heavily, throws herself into her work as a private investigator, and barely sleeps. She has nightmares and flashbacks. We find out she briefly saw a therapist, but stopped going to sessions, though she learned a simple technique to help manage her panic attacks. Whenever she is overcome with anxiety, she recites the names of the streets by her childhood home to ground herself in the memory of a safe place -- a place, we find out later, that Kilgrave will desecrate too.But her freedom from Kilgrave is short lived. He is not dead, as Jones initially thought. And as often happens after women leave abusive relationships, she gets entrapped in the cycle of abuse again. Kilgrave has taken a new prisoner, a young woman named Hope. With Hope under his spell, he begins to relive the faux courtship that he did with Jones, taking Hope to the same hotel, picking the same restaurant for their one-month anniversary.Abusive relationships often follow a pattern, and Kilgrave is no different. He flaunts to Jones that he will continue his behavior, and if it is not her who is being controlled, it will be someone else. While Jones succeeds in rescuing Hope, Kilgrave forces the young woman to execute her parents, and she is arrested for the crime.Hope’s experience after arrest also mirrors what many victims of abusers go through. No one believes Hope's story of mind control. She is written off as a mentally unstable woman, an unreliable narrator of her own experience. And Kilgrave’s powers render him immune to the justice system. No cop can touch him. It’s an experience not unfamiliar to many domestic violence survivors. The justice system may not protect you, and may even incarcerate you for crimes an abuser forced you to commit.As Jones works to prove Hope’s innocence, Kilgrave sets about making Jones’ life so unbearable that her only choice is to come back to him. While he is not actually controlling her mind, he makes the world around her unpredictable and violent, robbing her of any semblance of safety. She can’t trust anyone, and doesn’t want to get close to anyone for fear that he will use them against her. Kilgrave isolates Jones. Her self-esteem is shot, tormented by the things she did and the person she became while under his control.What makes Kilgrave such a frightening villain is his familiarity. Many women have met a man who acts like him. He is adept at manipulating people, and ducks all responsibility for the violence he creates. Even as bodies pile up because of his actions, he maintains that he’s never killed anyone. He uses psychological and verbal abuse to control his victims -- a critical element of domestic violence that is less understood than physical abuse. He tells Jones that she is remembering the past incorrectly. That she is crazy, and dramatic. That she really cared from him when they were together, and that she chose to stay. There’s a name for what he’s doing -- gaslighting. Kilgrave distorts the truth of Jones’ experiences in an effort to make her question her own version of reality. In the real world, gaslighting has a disorienting effect and can make survivors mistrust their own instincts.The series also deftly shows the compromises survivors make to protect themselves and those close to them. In one episode, Kilgrave threatens to hurt someone Jones cares about. To stop him, she agrees to send Kilgrave a smiling selfie every morning at 10 a.m. Survivors know what abusers are capable of, and whether it’s worth it to try to mitigate the damage. They are experts in their own experiences. (Just imagine, for a minute, how those selfies would be used to discredit Jones if they were reported about in the media. The public would ask why a victim would send smiling selfies to an alleged rapist? The images would be used to impugn her character.)Survivors don’t act like you might expect them to. Sometimes they do things that seem counterintuitive -- returning to their abusers, for example -- but they are doing what they need to do to keep themselves or their loved ones from harm. Sometimes surviving means taking the blow, so your kid doesn’t bear the brunt later. Sometimes surviving means stealing food so that you don’t have to ask your abuser for money. Survivors’ choices can look incomprehensible to outsiders.There’s a point in ""Jessica Jones"" where an exhausted and isolated Jones returns to Kilgrave to live with him for a few days. It’s unclear if her plan was always to double-cross him, or if she thought it was her only option to minimize the carnage, or both. But her calculation is clear: Better the devil you know. She is willing to sacrifice herself, rather than let another person get hurt. While at the house, he tries to touch her, and when she resists, he reminds her they used to have sex. She corrects him, and calls it what it was: Rape. ""Which part of staying in 5-star hotels, eating in all the best places, doing whatever the hell you wanted, is rape?"" he asks. ""The part when I didn’t want to do any of it. Not only did you physically rape me but you violated every cell in my body and every thought in my goddamn head,"" she says. In those two sentences, Jones captures what is so insidious about intimate partner violence. It’s much more than just physical violence. Or being called cruel names. Or living with fear. The real damage is how deeply the abuser can get inside your own mind, and control how you think and feel about yourself. ""I want you to say it: ‘None of it is my fault,"" Jones urges Hope early on in the show, trying to alleviate the young woman’s guilt. But despite her insistence that the things Kilgrave compelled Hope to do aren't her own actions, Jones still spends the remainder of the series trying to believe it herself. ""Jessica Jones"" is a show about many things, but chief among them is a story of how a woman learns to live with trauma and still persevere.

While hosting the 2015 Soul Train Awards on Sunday night, Badu made sure to throw a major diss the ""Black Widow"" singer's way. During her monologue, the singer made fake calls to people and pretended to invite them to the show. One of those people was Azalea. ""Uh, yes? Who is this? Iggy Azalea?"" Badu said. ""Yeah, hey. Oh, no, no, no, no, you can come, 'cause what you doin' is definitely not rap."" Ouch. That one's gotta sting a little. The audience responded with thundering applause. Azalea caused quite the stir back in May when she won the Billboard Music Award for Top Rap Artist, beating out Drake, Nicki Minaj and J.Cole, and the award for Top Rap Song (for ""Fancy""). People were so disappointed, they actually started a petition to get the latter revoked. In 2014, Azalea beat out Eminem and Drake at the American Music Awards for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist and Album, which people also weren't happy about. Judging by her comments, we'd say Badu is one of those people. But Azalea isn't one to back down, so it's only a matter of time before she speaks out on this latest beef. Also on HuffPost: "

17,WOMEN,When Toxic Masculinity Meets Anti-Abortion Panic,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planned-parenthood-shooting-toxic-masculinity-meets-anti-abortion-panic_us_5658d45de4b079b2818a7181,"The Planned Parenthood shooting was terrifying, but not surprising.",2015-11-30,When Huckabee compared Planned Parenthood to a heroin dealer.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560d7db41900002f00fdef3d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"On Friday, just one day after millions of Americans sat down for Thanksgiving dinner, a man began an hours-long assault at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs which left a police officer and two civilians dead.The Washington Post and Newsweek have since reported that the alleged shooter, Robert Lewis Dear Jr., used the phrase ""no more baby parts"" when talking to police afterwards. (The comment likely references the heavily-edited videos an anti-abortion group made about Planned Parenthood, which featured discussion of the -- completely legal! -- practice of fetal tissue donation.) Dear was also once arrested on ""Peeping Tom"" charges, and faced an allegation of domestic violence.Sadly, the news of a mass shooting is no longer surprising. Neither is the fact that this shooting took place at a Planned Parenthood clinic or that the alleged gunman has a history of being accused of violence against women. The whole tragic incident feels depressingly, quintessentially American.Acts of violence against abortion providers do not exist in a vacuum. There is a long, storied history of attacks on clinics -- this year alone there have been four arson attacks on Planned Parenthood clinics. There's a reason that the staff at the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood had completed drills and trainings for emergencies such as an ""armed attack.""And there is a long, storied history of vicious anti-abortion rhetoric in this country, much of which aims to intimidate those who provide abortions and the women who get them. After Friday's shooting, many men and women tweeted their support for the gunman, with comments like, ""planned parenthood kills a million babies and no one bats an eye. but 1 brave hero tries to put a stop to that, everyone loses their minds"" and ""Active Shooter Colorado Planned Parenthood. I would think this brave HERO is saving innocent Baby lives!""Terrifyingly, the tweets don't sound all that different from the language used by Republican presidential candidates. Both Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee have compared abortion to slavery, and Carly Fiorina described gruesome footage from an anti-Planned Parenthood video which she said showed ""a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain."" The only catch? The footage never existed. The Guardian's Jessica Valenti summed up the terrifying power of such rhetoric in two sentences: ""We know why this [shooting] happened... Because of hate, because of lies, and because words matter."" Not only do words matter, but representation and education matter, too. It is no accident that we see so few women getting abortions without horrific consequences on television -- in 2015, the normalized abortion storylines on both ""Jessica Jones"" and ""Scandal"" still felt revolutionary. And the state of sexual education in this country is deplorable. Often students are taught to fear sex but not how to have it safely; they're taught to condemn abortion but not how to avoid unplanned pregnancy.We live in a culture that breeds people who are terrified of women who exercise bodily autonomy -- especially when that autonomy involves decision-making around sex and family planning. When you combine that fear with a society that tells men they are entitled to women's bodies, time, attention and affection in the ways they deem fit, and generally does not teach men how to express their emotions in a productive fashion, can we really be surprised that year after year we see the bullets of male rage and toxic masculinity littered across our country? It is always impossible to pinpoint the exact combination of factors that drive someone to shoot up a public space, whether it's a church or a movie theater or a clinic. Mental illness may have played a part in the Colorado Springs attack. But it certainly doesn't explain why a man targeted a Planned Parenthood and used lies perpetuated by anti-abortion activists to justify his actions.Reminder: Misogyny is not a mental illness.It is exhausting to read -- and write -- about shooting after shooting after shooting. Exhausting to see white male shooters consistently labelled ""mentally ill lone wolves.""It's exhausting to witness a political climate that tacitly condones women being bullied and terrorized for accessing legal health care. Exhausting to live in a country where people are willing to openly condone a senseless attack that left three dead and nine wounded. Because, ultimately, when an organization that primarily serves women is under attack, all women are under attack. Also on HuffPost:"
18,POLITICS,Dru Hill Calls For 'Change' In Hometown Of Baltimore,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dru-hill-change-new-song-baltimore_us_565c8102e4b072e9d1c276f3,"""How can we change our future if the youth are left in the past?""",2015-11-30,A group of curfew violators attend a demonstration over the death of Freddie Gray at Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore on April 29.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565c82c71b00009c0029ebf5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Since Freddie Gray’s death after a “rough ride” in police custody, the nation has become familiar with the systemic problems facing Baltimore. Charm City’s school system is, essentially, segregated; the police routinely harass civilians and the city’s government prevents them from speaking publicly about the alleged facts of civil suits they file in response. This is the same police force that poorly handled the protests and riots that rocked the city following Gray’s funeral on April 27. The western portion of the city, which includes Gray's neighborhood of Sandtown-Winchester, is home to over half of all people released from Maryland's prison system each year. The violent crime rate in the neighborhood is 23 incidents per 1,000 residents -- almost double the city's rate as a whole and six times the national rate. More than half of the area's residents ages 16 to 64 are out of work, and many people end up with minor drug convictions.R&B group Dru Hill wants to address that by doing what they do best -- making music. “Change,” a new song from the group, which rose to prominence in the '90s, discusses some of the most high-profile cases of extrajudicial killings of unarmed black children and teens -- including 12-year-old Tamir Rice, 18-year-old Michael Brown and 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.The group decided to release the song on Monday to coincide with the start of the first of six trials of officers charged in Gray’s death.Along with the release, the group is launching #BMoreNow, an international campaign dedicated to facilitating change by encouraging conversations addressing the most debilitating issues facing communities -- such as poverty, racial discrimination, poor educational opportunities and health care access. Dru Hill is also partnering with several Baltimore-area businesses including The Fudgery, the fudge shop where they were discovered, which is creating an exclusive fudge flavor to raise money for Baltimore; The Stokey Project, an entertainment company that aims to inspire people to use their talents to succeed and is led by Carmichael ""Stokey"" Cannady, a former drug dealer-turned-activist; and the Baltimore Community Fund. The group will send all proceeds from “Change” to the fund’s Endowment for Neighborhoods, as well as other charities over the course of 2016.The Huffington Post talked with Mark ""Sisqó"" Andrews, Larry ""Jazz"" Anthony, Tamir ""Nokio"" Ruffin and Antwuan ""Tao"" Simpson, all of whom grew up in Baltimore, about the song and the future they would like to see for their city. What inspired this song?Nokio: We were out of town on the days when everything first started happening and I was sitting in my room ... and I was like, “Man, we gotta do something. What can we do?” One of the ideas we came [up] with was doing the song and it was really just watching TV, growing up in the neighborhood, you know, experiencing different things and just kind of like -- it was just like a burst of emotion came out. Is there anything in particular about Freddie Gray’s death that resonated with any of you?Nokio: Growing up in Baltimore, you see different things. Like I said, the neighborhood that everything happened [in] just happened to be the neighborhood that I grew up in and that we used to rehearse in. It’s just one of those things that, after a while, enough is enough. And regardless of how people feel across the board, when it comes down to unrest and things like that -- all that we know at this point is that something happened while he was in police custody. And now we’re gonna have a chance to get all the facts [in the trial] and see what happened and hopefully, along with that, begin to have a discussion about these incidents and what we can do between community members and police to just have it cease now. Things have been going on for too long … and now’s the time to start some healing and some changes. That’s one of the things that has stuck out to me the most about Freddie Gray’s case. The public knows absolutely nothing at this point. So, what do you hope this song will add to the police brutality narrative? Or just the conversation that we’re having in this country right now? Sisqo: One of the reasons I think it resonated, this kind of piggybacks to what Nokio said, about kind of feeling like enough is enough. I can recall being in different parts of the world and seeing different cases of police brutality and every time they would mention … where it happened, I would think to myself, “Please don’t let it be Baltimore.” And soon as I heard it was Baltimore, I said, “Uh oh. It’s about to go down.” Our city -- most of the city is tough to come up in. And I know, firsthand, a lot of the youth programs we used to have growing up aren’t around anymore, don’t have funding or even have a facility to put these kids in. I just felt like they were just looking for something to do. And when the emotions of this case ran high, [that] made it really difficult for those young kids.I think the only thing that really kind of got to me was that our families [live] in that Baltimore, Maryland, area. And we were calling because the way it was portraying us on the media was as if the entire city was burning, but it just so happened to be the neighborhood where Nokio lived and where we used to go to rehearse every day.Nokio: The biggest thing is to start to have a narrative. Like if there could be more understanding on both sides -- understanding from police officers that work the inner-city neighborhoods, understanding the neighborhood that you’re in and the things that happen, getting out and knowing the people. We won’t have to walk around -- especially inner-city youth -- as soon as I see a police officer, I feel like something bad is gonna happen. That’s not a good place to start. And that’s a feeling that we’ve all had since we were kids.Sort of when you’re in kindergarten and third grade and you see “Officer Friendly” and it’s like, “Oh, maybe I want to be a police officer.” Then you go out and get a little bit older and you’re in your neighborhood and get harassed. Or you have a family member that’s assaulted unnecessarily … The generation now, they don’t wanna hear any talk about anything. Like Sisqo was saying with the youth programs being gone, education being bad, just nothing to do -- it’s like, OK, it’s time for some change. It’s time for something to happen. And if you’re not going to see that in yourself, then we’re gonna make you see it. There has to be a point where somebody says, we’re gonna break the cycle and we’re really gonna get in here and try to figure out how we can have better community relations so that we can bring back some of the things like the police athletic league … and other things like the rec center that give another direction to their energy so that youth don’t feel like the only way you gone hear me is if I go out here and I really make some noise. It shouldn't have to get to that point. Based off the lyrics, it looks like y’all are taking a very humanizing approach because, as we all know -- especially in cases of police brutality, black people are not really seen as human. I don’t know if y’all read what Darren Wilson had to say about Mike Brown but he was basically talking about how Brown was this supernatural phenomenon who just had really superhuman strength. Do y’all have any comment on this idea that black people aren’t seen as people?Nokio: It’s part of the perception that comes from not being in the neighborhood and around us. To not understand where you are and the people that you’re around, there’s gonna be a disconnect and there is gonna be some type of perception that’s not reality. That in context of police brutality is only going to dwindle down and eventually cease with having people come in and understand that all of us aren’t criminals or criminals-in-training. A lot of the kids out here expressing themselves the way they are -- they're very intelligent and have ideas and they just wanna be heard. So if people get the chance to be heard by people [who] don’t understand [them], maybe that will begin to take away part of that stereotype. Sisqo: Also not having a car and having to walk to the bus stop every day makes you pretty strong [laughs]. People who are underprivileged build more than just character.You’re right, I feel you. My next question is broader and more visionary. What changes would you like to see in Baltimore?Sisqo: I would like to see us figure out a way to … have a couple more youth programs, a couple more people step up and sponsor more things for the youth instead of giving up on them. [And] figure out a way to give them something to do to channel that energy. The arts and music are great ways as well as sports. I know that several times before, I’ve bought football uniforms for my old high school. They actually called me last week about being inducted into their music hall of fame -- that’s kind of cool. But, for me, I would just really like to see more of a concerted effort to help the youth instead of giving up on them. Nokio: Definitely seeing money go back into education here instead of having schools closing, and overcrowded and not enough teachers. A lot of schools in the inner city, I can remember a few years ago they did a documentary on HBO about me and Jazz’s old high school, Frederick Douglass -- which is actually the high school that a lot of these kids came from when they started rioting at Mondawmin Mall … That’s a big part along with seeing money come into neighborhoods for people who want to open up businesses in their own neighborhood and possibly offer jobs to the youth in the neighborhood. So not only would they be able to work, they wouldn’t have to go way across town and have things interfere with school. Jazz: Back in the day, you always heard the saying “It takes a village to raise a child.” And I think that whole personal ownership of the community is lost. From your neighborhood watch to … your rec center -- there were so many things included in what was going on that a lot of the new youth that were in the community were known by name. Even the police officers there had a relationship with the business owners there and some of the elders in the community. It seems everything has been desensitized … We need some positive, creative things to get these kids involved because they don’t believe in nothing anymore. A lot of talk has been given and no action. At the same time you got so many kids dying -- they not really up for a whole bunch of talking at all. Like Sisqo was saying, you gotta be tough to live in the neighborhood, period. The cops really going hard at these kids because they’re not backing down, but at the same time it seems like the whole police force has become a gang. They complain about the kids but, shit, the whole force has become a gang itself. So, really, unification has to be met.This interview has been edited for length and clarity."
