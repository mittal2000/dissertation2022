There are some women who know exactly, from the moment they can speak. But for me I needed to find the man in order to understand the bigger picture.”And as she went through the wedding planning process -- culminating with her nuptials on August 31 -- friends gave Bosworth very specific advice.“Don’t try to not cry. If you’re going to cry, cry. When you try not to, it’s the worst picture-face of all time,” a friend told the actress.“I’ll keep that in mind,” Bosworth said. “I suppose the best thing I’ve learned is to just be in the moment. It’s one of those clichés, but it’s true; if you try and control too much then you’ll really miss all the magic.”Bosworth and Polish tied the knot in Philipsburg, Montana in front of 50 to 75 of their closest friends and family. The pair confirmed their engagement in September 2012.Check out the slideshow below to see which other celebrities tied the knot this year. Keep in touch!

You line up at airport security and start putting everything on the conveyor belt -- shoes, laptop, scarf -- but then realize you packed a full-sized bottle of shampoo in your carry-on. The TSA agent raises his eyebrows, so you reluctantly walk over to the garbage can, toss the bottle in, and clunk, there goes your good vacation hair. At least, that was the case until recently. Genius beauty company 3FLOZ just installed 25 vending machines filled with travel-sized beauty products -- the good stuff, including Burt's Bees and Frederic Fekkai -- in airports across the country, so you can replenish post-security. Clearly, the minds behind this invention know a thing or two about travel, so we asked 3FLOZ co-founders Alexi Mintz and Kate Duff to share their packing essentials and routines...See Also: Expert Tips for Women Traveling AloneWhat are three things that are always in your carry-on? Alexi Mintz: Air Repair Rescue Balm, David Kirsch Raspberry Vitamins and Warby Parker Sunglasses. Kate Duff: I never travel without my Air Repair Rescue Balm (my hands and lips are always dry when I travel), socks (keep my feet warm), and my Beats by Dre headphones (soundproof and I can listen to music or catch-up on my fave shows).What are some of your tried and true packing strategies? AM: Always wear your heaviest clothes on the plane and roll your clothes. KD: [Pack] shoes first (always in bags), then toiletries, then clothes laid out flat, not folded.Which beauty products are essential for traveling? Which can you probable leave at home? AM: An anti-frizz hair product regardless of the destination, sunscreen serum, and a facial scrub. These days, I pack travel versions of everything I have in my bathroom. You never know what you may want at any given time. KD: Moisturizers and sunscreens are essential for traveling. I am not one to leave any part of my regime at home. I'm high-maintenance, so I'm not the one to ask.Which hotels have the best beauty minis in their bathrooms? AM: I love the Morgan hotels. They carry Malin + Goetz (which we carry as well). KD: The W hotels because they have Bliss, and I stayed at the Regency Beverly Hills Wilshire (Reg Bev Wil, if you have seen Pretty Woman) a few years ago and they had their own brand of amenities, which smelled amazing.Why is it important to have the 3FLOZ vending machines in airports? AM: They provide accessibility and convenience to a curated selection of products needed for travelers, right when they need them. KD: 3FLOZ automated retail stores in airports were the logical next step for us. We are focused on helping travelers look and feel their best while on-the-go, and we can only do that if we are everywhere travelers need us to be.More from Condé Nast Traveler: The Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities in the World The Best Fall Travel Destinations We Dare You to Walk Across these Bridges How to Fit Everything Into One Carry-On Bag "

After all, no one wants to face cancer withOUT Joy; everyone wants to be happy, even while battling cancer. Who wants to waste precious moments of life feeling negative? Being SAD (S - Scared, A - Angry, and D - Depressed) for long just doesn't get you anywhere! For reasons unbeknownst to me God decided to not only bestow upon me the powerful & positive idea to help others face ""Cancer with JOY,"" but I was also given the thought that helping others face ""Cancer with Faith,"" literally and figuratively was very unique and something I should pursue. While my faith was an important part of my journey and the 18 chemo. treatments I received (I'll write about how one line of the Lord's Prayer jumped out at me during my treatment in a future post!), and it was certainly strengthened through 3 years of chemotherapy treatments and with the passing of two grandparents (one in 2010 just 60 days after my diagnosis, and one in 2012), my name isn't Faith. As a cancer survivor, I can personally say I've been there and I know facing ""Cancer with JOY"" can be done! I'm not a doctor or someone who's never had cancer saying, ""Yep, you can face 'Cancer with JOY' and have cancer and still be happy."" I wondered if there was someone out there -- named Faith -- who had maybe cared for someone facing cancer as a caregiver and was helping them face ""Cancer with Faith"" also literally and figuratively. I'm intrigued by these double meanings!I'm asked to speak at a lot of churches and share my story and message that ""cancer doesn't have to steal your JOY!"" While no one's happy they have cancer, you can have cancer and still be happy! I think I receive these requests to speak because this message is such a positive take on a devastating thing. It's also very helpful to hear this message vs. others that don't resonate like some of the profanity I see on t-shirts with the word cancer! So I began on a search for ""Faith,"" fortunately not too figuratively, but more literally! The universe brought me someone amazing! Faith Goldy is a 24-year-old journalist in Canada. Her Mom Julia was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in February of 2008. Faith described herself in her original e-mail to me as a ""C & E (Christmas & Easter) Christian."" She also said now ""the Rosary is my mother's main medicine."" See Faith and her Mom Julia here. When Faith's Mom was first diagnosed a panel of seven Doctors looked at her. The majority, four of them, recommended no chemo. Julia was only given a few weeks to a few months to live when she was first diagnosed. That was about five and a half years ago! She did two rounds of chemo., and lost about 30 pounds. She stopped the chemo. since the side effects were so brutal. Faith said, ""We were left with nothing but the Bible, God's word."" Faith also said her Mom has changed her diet. ""She's certainly gone much more alkaline... as much organic as possible."" Faith's name is Faith Julia; her middle name comes from being named after her mother. She shared a story that gave me tingles when we were discussing how she got her name! Faith said her Mom Julia was in the hospital and she was frankly freaking out over having her first child. Julia said a ""nurse"" cupped her face in her hands and said, ""Have Faith."" Julia did, literally and figuratively! That's how she decided what name to give her newborn Faith. She could not find this ""nurse"" again and says she truly believes it was a visit from an Angel!Julia faces ""Cancer with Faith,"" quite literally with Faith as her primary caregiver as well as figuratively! Julia's favorite bible verses are John 2: 3-5. When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him, ""They have no wine."" (And) Jesus said to her, ""Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come."" His mother said to the servers, ""Do whatever he tells you."" Faith's favorite verse is James 1:17 ""Every good fit and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning."" Please comment and share how you too face ""Cancer with Faith,"" literally if there is someone named Faith in your life helping you face cancer, and figuratively as well! What bible verse is helping you through your cancer journey, whether you are facing cancer or supporting someone with cancer?"

However, the Fluffernutter earned widespread notoriety (and a cult following) when Durkee-Mower, manufacturer of Marshmallow Fluff, coined the term in 1960 in efforts to advertise their product.Nostalgia for this retro-style favorite has brought a new wave of Fluffernutter recipes, with modern twists that take the peanut-butter-marshmallow-fluff combo to a whole new level.

It's also likely that you've tasted peanut brittle, and that upon doing so you fell in love with the crunchy and salty-sweet goodness that is this sweet. But what might not be quite as likely is that you've thought a bit outside the box and recognized that peanut brittle is far from being the only (or even necessarily the best) type of brittle out there. The base of brittle is hardened, caramelized sugar -- something that goes well with fruits, pecans, bacon and everything in between. This versatility, along with the beauty of brittle's glass-like pieces, makes it a perfect dessert for parties, gifts, or just sweet snacking around the house. We found 14 incredible brittle recipes that go way beyond peanut, and they'll have you falling in love with the many ways of making this sugary treat.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

5,TRAVEL,Here's How an American Bakery Became the Third-Best Restaurant in Paris,"Diana Keeler, Contributor

This weekend, Bertie's CupCakery -- a bastion of American baking almost literally in the shadow of the Notre Dame Cathedral -- will celebrate its first anniversary with Champagne and red velvet cupcakes, the latter of which will be topped with cream-cheese frosting. (That might not sound like such an achievement, but it's the result of months of lobbying French food authorities and a battery of lab tests proving that Philadelphia cream cheese, in its frosting form, can, indeed, be safely served at room temperature.) We spoke to Maker about the perils and possibilities of opening a bakery in Paris -- when your language skills are limited (""Bonjour!"") and your professional specialty (""giraffe cakes for baby showers where you don't know if it's a boy or a girl"") doesn't easily translate. What happens when your cupcake shop is ranked the third-best restaurant in Paris on TripAdvisor? Do you get an email? There was no email. There was an ecstatic text message from a colleague. Just a couple months earlier, I'd looked on the site, and we were, like, three-thousand-something, and I was high-fiving my husband. I mean, there are 10,000 restaurants in Paris -- we were in the top half! But you kept moving up. We got to 47, and we were like, How far can cupcakes go? Only a week or two later we jumped -- to 3. You put ""Paris"" into TripAdvisor, and we were on the front page. It was an instantaneous change of business. You hadn't moved to Paris necessarily set on opening a business.  I would have loved to work somewhere, but being pastry-trained in a more American style, my specialty was big fondant cakes and character cakes -- like giraffe cakes for baby showers where you don't know if it's a boy or a girl. But that's not super popular here. So I was like, Ugh -- what am I going to do? I didn't have any friends. I didn't speak the language. In Paris, it's hard to make friends. In small towns, everyone knows you're the new girl, and they bring you pie. We'd figured there'd be more American bakeries here, but there wasn't a lot for expats who want something for their kids. This palce was physically small enough that it wasn't overwhelming, so we just jumped in the deep end, cannonball-style -- backwards, blindfolded, upside down.How good was your French when the shop opened? Basically it was ""Bonjour."" If the conversation got really desperate, people just end up pointing. I used to have Post Its back here no one could see with my prompts: ""Avez-vous choissi? Voulez-vous un boisson?""  I'd think it'd be impossible, as a foreigner, to start a business in France. I walked every street and side street in central Paris, looking in all these shop windows, thinking about how I could make it work. And then we saw this little space. It was so dark -- it had red carpeted walls, these Gothic-style chandeliers. But I walked by it a few times, and started seeing the people traffic on the street, and you start thinking, ""Maybe."" There is a lot of red tape, but it's sort of like all the lines and barriers are customs at the airport -- there is a way through it. There must be some benefits to working in Paris, too. The French have a bad rap. In the U.S., we're so stressed out -- we gotta make money, we gotta make the rent, we gotta go go go. And here.... This morning, we had a misunderstanding with the schedule and opened an hour late. In the U.S., if you're a big shop and you open an hour late, people would be slamming you on Twitter: ""This is unacceptable!"" I'd be handing out gift certificates for free cupcakes: ""I'm so sorry."" Here, they knock on the window and wave and say, ""We'll come back, thanks!"" You live in Paris, you're married to an American, and yet you're Canadian. Explain. I'm from Newfoundland, Canada. Newfoundlanders are a special breed. There's not a lot on Newfoundland but people who put their hard down and work hard for nothing. They're a tight crowd, and they don't like to take any crap from anybody, especially anyone from Ontario or Quebec. There's a Newfoundland flag on your door. Someone brought that over! When a Newfoundlander does something, all the Newfoundlanders call all the other Newfoundlanders they know and tell them about it -- when they heard about the bakery back home, Newfoundlanders were like, ""Yes! We made it to Europe!""Can you anticipate what people are going to order based on their nationality? Americans are open -- sometimes they'll want the vanilla-vanilla, and other times they're like, ""Give me the weirdest thing you have."" The Italians love Nutella and pistachio. The French will almost always have the strawberry or the lemon. Europeans in general won't eat the cookie ones. They'll look at the Oreo one like, It's a cake? With buttercream, and you smash cookies into it? It's overload. I'd never suggest an Oreo one for an older, very well-put-together French woman. It's too rich. I'm not going to give her the salted caramel, which is the trend all the Americans want to try. Or the bacon? I've just started experimenting with that! But I'm definitely not going to give that particular woman the maple syrup and bacon."
