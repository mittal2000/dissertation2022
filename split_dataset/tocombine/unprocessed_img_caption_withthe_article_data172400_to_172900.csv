It was a much greater logistical challenge before we had texting, Facebook and the ability to place online personal ads on Craigslist or Backpage.Now, after a moment of spousal neglect or a fight, you can reunite with a long-lost girlfriend from high school, a flirtatious co-worker or even an anonymous person ready for sex -- often within a matter of minutes. This makes the definition of cheating and adultery more complicated. It also makes it harder to catch your spouse in bed in with someone else.In my practice as a family attorney, I have seen spouses use the iPhone's GPS to time their rendezvous with a lover within minutes of the wife's arrival from the grocery store. Clients have reported using their lunch hour at work to meet their lover at a hotel for a quickie.Others, whose preference is for random hookups, utilize the personal sections of websites -- even posting revealing photos of themselves (often enhanced). Many go so far as to include what they want to do and with whom they want to do it.The Backpage.com users are even more explicit about their fantasies. They list whether one will ""host,"" i.e. come to your place, or even do it ""girlfriend style,"" meaning that they will agree to act like they like it, will snuggle afterward and possibly agree to not use any protection. Backpage.com users also utilize terms such as ""will bring party favors,"" which is code for sexual toys, drugs or alcohol.If one wants to keep his or her marriage alive and hide the ugly truth of an affair, there are now websites where you can find other openly ""committed"" marrieds who are seeking other marrieds to share in a mutually secretive affair. AshleyMadison.com -- the married, cheaters' version of Match.com -- offers cheaters a forum to connect with other married people who want to maintain the facade of the marriage while getting the benefits of outside sex.The world of cheating has expanded from chance encounters -- like a secret desire to run into an ex at the grocery store -- to actively soliciting an affair via social media, bulletin boards and subscription sites. Rather than beginning with a chance encounter, affairs now mostly begin with the intentional click of a button.Technology can be a dangerous thing in marriages because all of the ads and postings are indelible on the web, regardless of whether or not they are deleted. I often subpoena them in cases of infidelity. Text message to lovers or ""emotional paramours"" are also able open to discovery in litigation.Lovers' letters are no longer sent in the mail or attached to bouquets of flowers. Now, divorce lawyers have endless fodder for adultery cases thanks to the blow-by-blow records provided via email, texts and online postings. When we used to have to hire private investigators, now we can simply check Facebook status updates.Be careful what you ask for. Although high-tech cheating is easy and convenient, the damage it causes to a family and children is exacerbated because the indiscretions are available for all the world to see. Years from now, do you really want your children to be able to read about your indiscretions online?"

And some are getting twitchy. ""We are getting calls from clients daily,"" said Scott Cramer, president of Cramer & Rauchegger, an estate planning firm based in central Florida with more than 200 clients. ""They are very scared and nervous."" Cramer's clients are primarily concerned with taxes on capital gains, set to increase on Dec. 31, along with other tax hikes as part of the so-called fiscal cliff. The year-end game-changer is happening because tax cuts put into place under President George W. Bush are set to expire and Congress has failed to make a deal for an extension. President Barack Obama has said he wants to let Bush-era tax cuts expire for the highest-income Americans. That means individuals earning $200,000 a year and families making more than $250,000 will revert back to 1990s income tax rates of 36 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively. For middle-class earners, the president said he supports keeping current tax rates. But the middle-class doesn't escape the cliff. New taxes created under the Affordable Care Act go into effect for 2013 tax bills, including a 3.8 percent tax increase on investment income. More immediately, the alternative minimum tax could also slam as many as 30 million American families on their 2012 tax bills unless it’s patched by Congress. This is an additional flat tax for those making a certain income. Without a patch, it may add thousands to the tax bill for some middle-class families, tax experts said. Even if the Bush-era tax cuts are extended for millions of Main Street Americans, they will feel tax bill sticker shock on Jan. 1. The end of the payroll tax break will nibble away at income for as many as 160 million Americans. That means an American earning $50,000 annually will pay at least $80 more per month in taxes. Add to that, there may be higher tax-withholding by employers unless the IRS updates its withholding tables, tax experts said. So what's the bottom line for taxpayers who don't know what their bills holds next year? “Don’t spend every penny in your paycheck this side of New Years,” said Robertson Williams, tax policy expert and senior fellow at the Tax Policy Institute. ""There is a lot of political hardball to be played over the next eight weeks."""

Hurricane Sandy, upgraded again Saturday just hours after forecasters said it had weakened to a tropical storm, was barreling north from the Caribbean and was expected to make landfall early Tuesday near the Delaware coast, then hit two winter weather systems as it moves inland, creating a hybrid monster storm.

For him, the stakes are high. Garofalo relies on a home hemodialysis machine because he has advanced kidney disease. Like everything in his house the night of the storm, his life-sustaining machine went dark. Without properly functioning kidneys, he needs hemodialysis to filter the naturally occurring toxins in his body. After 48 hours without dialysis, most patients are at serious risk of potentially fatal complications.Although Lenny had purchased a generator for this kind of emergency, Sandy struck before he had it hooked up.""My first thought was, where am I going to go, what am I going to do?"" said Garofalo.More than 40,000 patients are on dialysis in the greater New York City area. Even an ordinary blackout is a potential risk, but long-term power outages like this one can be life-threatening if patients don't have back-up power or can't get to dialysis centers. Fortunately, Garofalo lived within several miles of the Queens Village Dialysis Center and received treatment there until he could get his home generator working.His twin brother, Tommy, was also by his side the whole time, making sure he didn't skip more than one treatment. At-home hemodialysis requires a trained caretaker, and Tommy spent a month learning the ins and outs of the NxStage hemodialysis machine and the process, which can take up to four hours, six days a week.A week since Sandy struck, Lenny Garofalo is once again getting dialysis treatment in the comfort of his own home. He encourages other home dialysis patients to make sure they have a trusted caretaker -- and a (working) generator -- in case of emergencies like the superstorm.""Kidney Dialysis: One More Disruption From Hurricane Sandy"" originally appeared on Everyday Health."
