The director was speaking with the New York Observer's Roger Friedman when they broached subject of his casting decisions. Ahead of the April debut of Allen's play about Harlem's Cotton Club, “Bullets Over Broadway,"" the New York Daily News claimed ""Allen specifically requested there be no black gangsters in his musical,"" citing an anonymous source. Allen's rep told the Daily News his priority is casting ""the exact appropriate person for a role regardless of race, which has never been a consideration."" Friedman asked if Allen would ever cast someone like Viola Davis, to which the director responded: “Not unless I write a story that requires it. You don’t hire people based on race. You hire people based on who is correct for the part. The implication is that I’m deliberately not hiring black actors, which is stupid. I cast only what’s right for the part. Race, friendship means nothing to me except who is right for the part.”Friedman then asked Allen about relationships in his personal life.“[Chris Rock] loved my work. When I got married to Soon-Yi he bought me a wedding present,” he said. “When I ran into him in Rome, we took him out for dinner. I’m friendly with Spike Lee. We don’t socialize, but I don’t socialize with anyone. I don’t have white friends either.”Salon noted that Lee was once one of the very people who criticized Allen for his casting choices. In a 1987 New York Times interview, Lee said: ""Woody Allen, he can do a film about Manhattan -- it's about one-half black and Hispanic -- and he doesn't have a single black person in the film."" "

Storm-driven waves crashed ashore and flooded seafront communities across a swathe of the eastern United States as Hurricane Sandy barreled towards land. Officials warned that the threat to life and property was 'unprecedented' and ordered hundreds of thousands of residents in cities and towns from New England to North Carolina to evacuate their homes and seek shelter. AFP PHOTO/Stan HONDA (Photo credit should read STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15b94240000300096c023.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two years ago this October, Hurricane Sandy blew through the Lehigh Valley, leaving power outages, flooding, downed trees, and closed roads in its wake. Though it was to varying degrees, nearly everyone in the Valley was somehow affected by Hurricane Sandy. Five deaths were attributed to the storm in the region; nearly 600 people were forced to seek shelters state-wide, and nearly 300,000 PPL and Met-Ed customers were without power in Lehigh and Northampton counties a day after the storm struck. While Pennsylvania avoided the worst of Sandy, the storm devastated other states such as New York and New Jersey and caused an estimated $50 billion in total damage.Hurricane Sandy is just one example of an extreme weather event that has caused enormous damage in our recent past. In the last two years alone, there have been 20 extreme weather events in the U.S. that inflicted at least $1 billion in damage each, caused 409 total fatalities, and caused $130 billion in aggregate economic loss. The harm was spread across 44 states, which speaks to the reality that extreme weather hits nearly every area of the country. East and Gulf Coast states are at risk of hurricanes; prairie and other central and southern states are constantly threatened by tornados; and western states commonly face damaging droughts. Extreme weather does not discriminate by American geography.And while a significant percentage of aftermath costs fall to individuals, it is increasingly insurance companies, states, and the federal government that end up with long-lasting, huge liabilities. Recognizing this reality, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) placed extreme weather on its 2013 High Risk List. This report details the most pressing federal fiscal exposures. Extreme weather threatens our energy and electric grid, federal buildings, transportation infrastructure, access to natural resources, public health, our relationships across the globe, and many other aspects of life. The bottom line is that weather events not only threaten private property and family budgets, but they also can decimate public resources and government coffers.Despite these risks, the GAO report found that the federal government is unprepared to deal with the threats posed by extreme weather. The report detailed that the government does not adequately take severe weather events into account when assessing its insurance exposure, and that federal planners should better factor in such costs with respect to infrastructure investments. Further, the report found that, as of 2012, there was no coherent, strategic, government-wide approach to preparing for extreme weather and no systematic method to distribute information for doing so to state and local governments.Based on these findings, it is clear the federal government needs to do a better job addressing resiliency, preparedness, and risk management issues. Though many federal agencies, state governments, and local organizations have their own preparedness plans, there is a lack of coordination amongst these entities that holds back our country's readiness and response. In my view, it is important that our national government exercise leadership to improve the resiliency of the entire nation in the face of continuing extreme weather.To that end, I introduced the PREPARE (Preparedness and Risk management for Extreme weather Patterns Assuring Resilience) Act on Thursday. This bipartisan, zero-cost legislation proposes some common sense solutions that build off the GAO's recommendations to increase resiliency. To help eliminate redundancy and streamline preparedness efforts, my legislation creates an oversight structure to ensure that federal agencies are creating and coordinating plans and procedures. My bill also requires that the federal government work with local and state planners, bringing them together, to get them the best information and practices possible so they can adopt and enhance their own preparedness plans. This legislation will establish more regional coordination to ensure cost-effectiveness, complementarity, and optimal reach of resiliency planning efforts.All of these improvements are accomplished in my bill without any additional spending. In fact, the changes I'm proposing will help the government save billions in the long run.Congress should take action to better protect the nation against extreme weather events, and the PREPARE Act is an important first step towards a more resilient country. Preparedness and emergency planning is something we can do right now to ensure that we can recover rapidly and effectively after extreme weather strikes. Sitting back and do nothing -- when we already have experience with the high cost of inadequate action -- unwisely exposes us to further unnecessary loss of life and property. The next Hurricane Sandy may do even more damage to both shore and inland areas like the Lehigh Valley, and we owe it to ourselves to get as prepared as possible for that coming event."

(Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1c9322200003401db6aa4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This op-ed was written on behalf of five Nigerian sisters in their quest to get an education. I grew up in Nigeria, in a culture where bearing a son validates a woman and her family, and a male innately holds the superior position in society over a female. At 11 years of age, I escorted my mother to deliver her fifth baby girl, my youngest sister, and watched our mom die in the hands of an unfit doctor. My mother had succumbed to the confines of her society; even though she already had four healthy daughters, having a son was a traditional standard she was determined to achieve, even at the expense of her life. Realizing the underlying factors that subjected her to such a predicament presented a vivid picture of my position as a girl in Nigerian society. Almost immediately, the importance of education took on a different meaning in my life and in the lives of my four sisters. I went on to receive a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry and a Master's of Science in Urban Affairs. With my education, I have been able to sponsor my younger sisters' education in Nigeria, thereby increasing our likelihood of having a progressive future that far surpasses the traditional limitations defined by our society.For Nigerian girls like my sisters and I, education is the key that opens the door when an opportunity to succeed beyond customary expectations knocks. Education is a fundamental right, to which I firmly believe we should be naturally entitled. It is the only chance most Nigerian girls have to rise above the cultural and traditional system of stratification that continue to cast women as inferior to their male counterparts, economically, politically and socially. Women who have been able to escape such subjugation have done so mostly by being empowered through education. A good education offers Nigerian girls the opportunity of being valued members of their society and for this vital reason I am devoted and driven to ensure that my sisters continue with their studies.For girls in Nigeria and around the world, education can enable economic independence, pave the way for political participation, and empower both men and women with the necessary knowledge to actively and effectively oppose oppressive norms that perpetuate different forms of violence against women. And in contrast to the culture of gender inequality that persists in Nigeria, education serves as an avenue of exposure to a cultural alternative. Nigerian girls stand to benefit from this exposure, and the possibility of such enlightenment poses a major threat to extremist groups such as Boko Haram.Though we dream and yearn for the miracle of immediate solutions, I know that change does not occur by magic, nor does it take place overnight; rather it requires the dedication of time and relentless collective effort. My mother's death is a product of unjust societal norms that facilitate perverse gender inequality. A society's customs are engineered by its past generations, and in the same fashion its future citizens can redefine the culture that rules them by cultivating a new norm through education.I am an optimist, and I believe it is possible to change the world, to better the status of women globally and particularly in places like Nigeria. This is not because I am naive or unaware of the shortcomings of many efforts to effect change. My optimism stems from a desperate place -- a core belief that the world as a whole, leaders and citizens, must awaken to the urgent need to end injustice against women. For me, necessity and possibility have become synonymous because living with the consequences of gender inequality makes it all the more obvious that change is imperative.While my heart bled over the sorrow captured in the ""Bring Back Our Girls"" cry for help, my mind desperately indulged in a renewed hope that Nigeria might no longer ignore the agony of women and girls. Unfortunately, it often takes the presence of pain to garner the passion of a nation to vehemently advocate for change and demand action by its government. Although Boko Haram is perceived as an opponent to progress, the greater obstacle lies in a broader reluctance to take action in protecting girls in Nigeria who simply want an education.  Nigerian girls, like my sisters and I, desire and deserve for our aspirations of becoming valued members of society to be realized. Education is the vehicle towards living this dream.About the author: Raised in Nigeria, Nnenna Agba gained popularity when she went on the widely watched television show America's Next Top Model.

Hirst's color spot paintings are being shown simultaneously at the Gagosian gallery's 11 locations around the world. The exhibition opens Thursday and runs through Feb. 10. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2785e220000bb01db96fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The people of Ilfracombe, England have a lot of feelings about Damien Hirst, and you can't blame them. To start with, the world's wealthiest artist (who keeps a house in Ilfracombe, a resort town on the Devon coast) loaned his adoptive seaside home a not-exactly-longed-for gift in the form of Verity, a gigantic bronze statue of a pregnant lady with visible innards and questionable interpretive value. Now Hirst is expanding his sights. His next step in Ilfracombe is to build a town on its outskirts, like some kind of art world version of Mr. Henry F. Potter.The North Devon Journal has details on Hirst's Southern Extension project, which was greenlit Wednesday. Dubbed Hirstville by critics (ahem), the 875-acre plot ""will be home to 750 houses, shops, a new primary school and health care facilities. Sports pitches, woodlands and allotments are also planned."" Remember this jolly addition to the Ilfracombe skyline? Photo by Getty.As with Verity, whose prominent placement at the harbor entrance drew ire, Southern Extension is divisive. Some are calling it a vanity project that will disturb wildlife, destroy the aesthetics of the small town and put unneeded pressure on its road with an influx of rich Londoners (only 10 percent of the homes are designated as low income housing). On the other side, Ilfracombe council members who voted in favor of the project cite job creation and population growth, both consequences sleepy seaside towns may not want, but often need in order to survive.Perhaps the most scathing review so far comes from Daily Mail columnist and Ilfracombe resident Robert Hardman, who wrote about Southern Extension when it was still being debated over last December. Hardman attacks Hirst more than he does the project, but the two, he argues, are intertwined. Comparing Hirst's latest endeavor to his flashy artwork -- the pickled shark, the diamond-encrusted skull -- he posits that Southern Extension is yet another ""lucrative triumph of hype over common sense.""Hirst does seem to see Ilfracombe as mere setting for temples to himself. Of the many institutions he's already backed in the town, few if any seem to take residents into account -- unless everyone in Ilfracombe is as obsessed with Hirst as he seems to be. Here's Hardman's list:He’s got his own restaurant — with pickled fish on the wall in homage to that infamous pickled shark — and is in the process of building a café three doors down. In between is his art gallery, where £4,000 will buy you a limited edition print of one of Hirst’s trademark ‘spot’ paintings...Just up the road from the port, he has a hotel project underway...By far the most obvious Hirst imprint, however, stands at the entrance to the harbour.Verity, that is, though her days as Hirst Imprint No. 1 are numbered. Detailed designs must still be submitted for Southern Extension before work can begin, but for all intents and purposes, Hirstville is a go. We're betting that park holds a pickled shark or two."

(Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76a9624000032005703ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For years now, fans and pundits have been complaining that baseball teams have become too defensive and scared, leading to a decline in meaningful trades, especially at the trade deadline. How many times have you had your eyes peeled on your computer until 4 p.m. on the trade deadline just to realize nothing happened? Well, whatever we thought was plaguing front offices to make them so boring is apparently gone, because we got a whole lot of big time trades yesterday. I'll break down the biggest ones here.The Trade: Jon Lester and Johnny Gomes to Oakland, Yoennis Céspedes and a compensatory draft pick to BostonWe've got to start off by discussing the clear blockbuster trade of the day. Most people would have thought the Oakland A's were basically finished making big deals after they traded three of their top prospects for Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel of the Cubs at the beginning of July. The trade was a clear win-now move by GM Billy Beane, giving up promising young players to bolster the rotation and make the first-place A's World Series favorites. However, Beane surprised everyone again by making another huge trade to further fortify the rotation, picking up the Red Sox's ace Jon Lester and platoon left-fielder Johnny Gomes. Once again, the A's had to give up a lot to make the move, trading All-Star and Home Run Derby champ Yoenis Céspedes to Boston along with what amounts to a first-round pick. These past couple years it's been very uncommon for a team in the hunt for a pennant to give up a starting player in an in-season trade, generally they only surrender prospects and bench players. Trading your biggest power hitter is a far departure from the norm. But this trade should end up being a huge win-win. Despite all of his talent, Céspedes's production has been disappointing this year and can most likely be replicated by the platoon of Johnny Gomes and new acquisition Sam Fuld. Even though Lester is a free agent at the end of the season, he will be Oakland's number one or two starter and hugely improve the A's three-man playoff rotation. They can now compete with the Tigers three-headed beast of Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer, and newly acquired David Price.On the other hand, Boston acquires an insanely talented hitter in Céspedes whose numbers could see a huge boost playing with Fenway's short confines and the hitter friendly parks of the AL East. You always have to gamble on talent, and Boston gets a whole lot of that here. All Boston had to give up was ten or so starts by a pitcher who wasn't going to make a difference in their season anyways and one more free agent to be in Gomes. The Red Sox are still hopeful that they can sign Lester in the offseason, and if they succeed in signing him this trade will look like a HUGE win for the Red Sox. Even if neither teams resigns Lester after the season, this trade is one of the few true blockbuster win-wins. The Trade: David Price to Detroit, Drew Smyly, Nick Franklin, and Willy Adames to the Rays, Austin Jackson to the MarinersIt's pretty unbelievable to have two trades with players of this caliber in the same year, let alone the same day. 2012 AL Cy Young winner David Price joins 2013 AL Cy Young Winner Max Scherzer and 2011AL Cy Young Winner Justin Verlander to form one of the scariest rotations in baseball history. Verlander's skills have diminished since his Cy Young years but those losses might be made up by the strength of the fourth and fifth guys in the rotation, Aníbal Sánchez and Rick Porcello, both of whom have sub 4 ERAs. If Verlander continues to struggle, it's conceivable they'll do what the Giants did two years ago with Lincecum and put Verlander in the bullpen. Even though the Tigers had to give up still valuable center fielder Austin Jackson to get the deal done, they're clear winners here. The Mariners also did great in this trade, picking up Jackson to man their weak spot in center, and only giving up the very light-hitting infielder Nick Franklin. It's hard to say the Rays were losers, they picked up a good young pitcher in Drew Smiley and got top Tigers prospect Willy Adames as well, but I consider it a disappointing haul for a former Cy Young winner. I think it's hard to justify giving up the best player in a deal and letting the second best player go to another team at the same time. Unless Adames becomes an impact player very soon, I'll maintain that the Rays should have rolled the dice on a playoff spot and traded Price in the offseason if things didn't break their way. This haul simply pales in comparison to what other teams got for dealing their aces. The Trade: John Lackey to St. Louis, Jon Kelly and Allen Craig to BostonThe Cardinals became the last team to pick up one of Boston's very in-demand starters. Lackey, who's had a personal resurgence over the past two years, is making his way to St. Louis after reportedly demanding a trade once Lester was dealt away. The Cardinals were smart to bring in a veteran to help a rotation that has been devastated by injury. Lackey tossed the last game of last year's World Series to silence the Cardinals, and I do believe that had an effect on St. Louis's decision to deal valuable players away for him. All the contenders this year have absolutely stacked rotations and the Cardinals didn't want to put themselves at a disadvantage by coming in with some patchwork starting pitching. They also get to have Lackey next year at an insanely low value ($500,000) due to Lackey's Tommy John surgery a few years back. In Boston, they pick up two players who will have an immediate impact in exchange for a pitcher who didn't want to be there anyways. The verdict: Another win-win but on a much smaller scale than the Lester-Cespedes deal. The Trade: Asdrúbal Cabrera to D.C, Zach Walters to ClevelandWashington is betting on the currently underperforming Cabrera to switch from shortstop to second base and fix their primary hole. Danny Espinosa has clearly not been the answer for the Nationals, and replacing him with a former All-Star in Cabrera is a marked upgrade even if he doesn't quite regain his previous form. The Indians pick up Cabrera's now or future replacement in Zach Walters, a recent call-up from Triple-A. Walters has struggled in his first taste of the big leagues but did some very nice work while in the minors. He can hit for power which is always valuable among middle infielders. Considering that Cabrera was on a relatively team-friendly contract, I don't love the deal for the Indians but I can live with it. The Nationals come out on the upper hand.The Trade: Jarred Cosart, Kike Hernandez, and Austin Wates to Miami, Colin Moran, Jake Marisnick, and Francis Martes to Houston I love everything Miami has done this year. They didn't go into this year expecting all that much with a young team, but everyone stepped up this season and even following phenom Jose Fernandez's heart-breaking early season inure, the Marlins have basically been a .500 team on the rise. Now realizing they have the talent to compete in not so long, they acquired one young, talented starting pitcher on a great deal and swapped mid-level prospects, highlighted by third baseman Colin Moran. Moran has a great glove and arm and showed a good bat in limited minor-league play. He was the sixth pick in last year's draft so it is a bit surprising to see him traded this early on in his career. Now he's just another prize in Houston's highly touted farm system, so we'll see what happens. Everyone involved is too unproven to call anyone a big loser or winner yet, but I like the strategy on Miami's part. The Trade: Stephen Drew to Yankees, Kelly Johnson to BostonMy jaw was on the floor when I saw the Sox and Yankees made a deal, but you'll rarely see a trade with less consequences than this one. The Red Sox dump some salary and open up the depth chart so the young un's (Brock Holt, Xander Bogaerts, and Mookie Betts) can get more playing time in an already lost season. Johnson became completely disposable to the Yankees after picking up Chase Headley earlier in the month so they replace him with a player at a more dire position of need. The Trade: Andrew Miller to Baltimore, Eduardo Rodriguez to BostonThe last move of the day for the Red Sox just brought in more value. They shed salary by trading away a soon to be free agent for the Oriole's number three overall prospect, Eduardo Rodriguez. Rodriguez has struggled in the minors this year, but remains highly valued by scouts and front-office people. The Orioles probably made a good play here, shoring up a weak bullpen to help themselves hold on to first place in the AL East. I would also like to think that the Red Sox were trying to make sure the Yankees won't make the playoffs by helping out the first place team. The rivalry lives on."

Citing bank bailouts, the protesters called for student debt cancelations.

Or maybe it was three cents in his pocket and five words of English. He worked hard and sacrificed so that his children and grandchildren could prosper. With a fifth grade education he parlayed a job changing car tires in an alley into a business changing car tired in an alley and eventually a tire store that also sold household appliances. He had six brothers. Some did as well as he did, others struggled but all of them were able to send their kids to college.I grew up learning this American Dream story and have passed it on for inspiration to my own children -- those I've raised and those I've taught -- but I'm starting to lose confidence in that inspiration and I'm beginning to worry that I'm not only perpetuating a myth but a destructive one. As JFK said, ""...the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie -- deliberate, contrived, and dishonest -- but the myth -- persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic.""The American Dream has, of course, always been at least part fraud. African Americans and others were largely denied access to many of the opportunities that defined it for a long time and even for those individuals with opportunity the hard work=prosperity correlation has not always been a reliable one.But I'm afraid we now find ourselves in an era of increasingly shattered American Dreams and nowhere is that more true than for the students I teach in South Los Angeles. These are young men and women who have defied all the perils of poverty, violence, ignorance, and despair. They are the ones who've made all the right choices and worked their asses off and faced their struggle head on. They are the young women and men who haven't dropped out, who haven't joined a gang or made a baby or succumbed to the escape of drugs or alcohol or apathy. These are the kids who've believed in the power of hard work. They've shown up to school every day and done their homework every night. They've taken college classes while they were in high school. And they've never backed down from a challenge, academic or otherwise. It is a beautiful thing to see their accomplishments and to be a part of them.But now I feel a little queasy about the whole thing because while I've been a true believer and I've perpetuated the belief in hard work as the great poverty buster, now when I talk to some of them I feel that I've perpetuated a great fraud upon them.Because I am hearing from young men and women who have just graduated college -- just like I urged them to four and five years ago -- and now they owe thousands in student loans and it seems they are lucky to get any job at all and most of them are working in jobs that don't require a college education. The lucky ones can move back with their parents and not all of them are that lucky. Surely the job market will improve -- won't it? I hope so because that is what I'm telling these unemployed and under-employed former students who drank the Kool-aid about a college education that I served them when I was their teacher. I hope I'm right and their struggle is not the result of long-term structural economic shifts. I hope I'm not just perpetuating more myths because it is what I told this year's senior and this year's juniors. I don't know what else to tell them. Go to college. Go to the best college you can. I'm still a believer but I wonder if I'm perpetrating a fraud.This year one of the seniors in my class needed a little extra prodding to apply to college. Let's call her Yazmin -- not her real name, of course. She is bright and hard-working but a broken family and a life of poverty and abandonment left her without much confidence. Fortunately, a graduate from a few years ago, now a Harvard University student, agreed to help her complete her applications. It was a beautiful thing to watch, the two of them huddled at my computer plotting a future. Yazmin got into five very good private colleges. All of them gave her financial aid, scholarships, and still expected her to borrow 25 or 30 thousand dollars a year. This is a child with nothing. A fractured family at a subsistence level. How do you ask that child to make a decision about taking on that much debt? She's never had more than $20 in her pocket. And what am I supposed to tell her? Unless I'm willing to co-sign on those loans -- and I still owe thousands I borrowed to put my own children through college.I called the admissions offices of a few of those private universities to ask them why they would offer such an arrangement to a poverty-stricken child, to ask if they understood what it might be like for that child to be given such an impossible choice. I was told that a superior college experience is worth any amount of money. I understand that argument. College is not a job training program. It's a life-transforming experience. But so is owing more money than you might ever be able to pay off. So, I'm sorry, but if the university wants to transform poor children they need to try a little harder to understand what it is like to have nothing.Yazmin decided, instead, to attend a campus of the California State University system, the largest university system in the world and the gateway to post-secondary education for thousands of underprivileged young people. She will have to borrow about $8000 a year, still a terrifying amount for someone with nothing, but she has faith in what I've told her, that a college education is her way out of poverty. I wish I had as much confidence in our economy and the potential for economic justice as Yazmin has in me.I'm trying to believe and I'm hoping like hell that things get better. Yazmin was supposed to sign up for a freshman orientation but when she tried to she was asked for a $174 fee. Apparently her financial aid did not cover it. No one -- at this university that serves thousands of underprivileged young people -- would tell a child with nothing at all what to do. She was too ashamed to tell me or anyone else at our high school and then last month was told that her admission to the university had been revoked -- she was now on a wait list for fall enrollment. This news was compounded when her father told her he could no longer provide her a place to live. I wrote to the university on her behalf and within a few days a sympathetic administrator re-instated her. I am grateful for the administrator with a heart but still baffled by the brutality of the institution.I guess there has never been an abundance of sympathy for those with nothing. Contempt comes easier than empathy. I am not always sympathetic to students who struggle in my class, especially if they seem not to be working hard -- though often those seemingly lazy students are reacting to a storm of misfortune in their lives outside of school or are overwhelmed by the demands of a class they've been insufficiently prepared for. I sometimes have to check myself and get real about who these young women and men are and what they are up against. I will always preach hard work but I'm at my best when the sermon is tempered by a little understanding.Too many of these young people are born falling backward and the obstacles are prodigious and even sometimes insurmountable. Some of these students are in my classes for two or three years and by the end of it I have invested an enormous amount of time in them -- much of that investment beyond my job description -- and an even greater emotional investment. Sometimes it is difficult not to think of them as my own children, especially those who are no longer being taken care of by their own parents -- and what is happening to a lot of these children has left me angry and heartbroken.Universities complain that high schools aren't adequately preparing our students for college. They are not unjustified in that complaint. We are not committing enough of our secondary resources to that kind of intellectual and academic preparation. We pay lip service to college prep and all too often allow too many obstructions and too much compromise.But I'd like to turn the tables on the post-secondary industry and ask them what they are doing to ensure that our students succeed once they get to college and after they graduate. I'm sure that most universities could present a power point demonstrating all the supports they have for minority students and struggling students but let's be real. They could do more, probably a lot more. Starting with a real commitment to full inclusion and an outright rejection of elitism.Elitism is a form of ignorance as destructive as any other and universities need resist the seduction of money and power so they aren't repositories of that ignorance. They -- and anyone else who gives a damn -- need to promote the ideals of equal opportunity and the American Dream and help support me and other idealists who try to help struggling children."

His leave is believed to be a long-term project (months rather than weeks) and thus won’t allow him to return in time for the matches against Europe in Gleneagles, Scotland.He ranks fifth in points and was a lock to make the team. The top nine in points through next week’s PGA Championship will qualify, and captain Tom Watson will make three picks to fill out the 12-man roster. Without Johnson, the 10th person on the points list will make the team. Patrick Reed, a three-time winner over the past year, is 10th, but the standings could change dramatically at the PGA.“We will certainly miss Dustin Johnson at Gleneagles, and we wish him the best,” Watson said in a statement. “As one of the longest hitters in the game with an undefeated record of 3-0 at Medinah in 2012, he has clearly been an asset for the United States team. That said, the United States is a team with an abundance of talent. I am looking forward to teeing it up alongside those players in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, and finding out along with everyone else, which players qualify for the team based on points.""Johnson’s departure comes six days after he missed the cut at the RBC Canadian Open and less than two weeks after he tied for 12th at the British Open, where he fell back on the final day.Johnson has several top finishes on Tour this season and ranks fourth in FedEx Cup points. He won the WGC-HSBC Champions last October and finished second at the Northern Trust Open and tied for fourth in the U.S. Open at Pinehurst, N.C.Johnson also took a break from the Tour in 2012, not playing from March 11 to May 31.Apparently he plans to spend plenty of time with fiancee Paulina Gretzky during the sabbatical. She posted an Instagram photo Monday of her putting and Johnson lining up the putt while crouched behind her. Her caption read, “Best caddy ever.”In a statement, the PGA Tour said, “We have nothing to add to Dustin’s statement, but we wish him well and look forward to his return to the PGA Tour in the future.""Associated Press reported that Jerry Kelly gets into the PGA Championship as a result of Johnson's leave.• • •Here is Johnson's complete statement, sent via email to media by David Winkle of Hambric Sports Management:""I am taking a leave of absence from professional golf, effective immediately. I will use this time to seek professional help for personal challenges I have faced. By committing the time and resources necessary to improve my mental health, physical well-being and emotional foundation, I am confident that I will be better equipped to fulfill my potential and become a consistent champion.I respectfully ask my fans, well-wishers and the media for privacy as I embark upon this mission of self-improvement."""

As we discussed water pollution, a July 13 New York Times article reported on an emerging hypothesis that poor sanitation in India may be more responsible than lack of food for current rates of childhood malnutrition.In spite of India's rapid economic development, childhood malnutrition remains a serious problem in that country, even as parents are better able to feed their children. What lies behind this cruel conundrum? The population is highly exposed to untreated water that is contaminated with fecal waste. Lacking toilets, sewers and sewage treatment, the sanitation situation is a public-health crisis. The High Cost of Poor SanitationA 2014 United Nations report notes that 82 percent of people who practice open defecation live in middle-income, populous countries such as India and Nigeria. Poor sanitation may extract a heavy toll on childhood health in these areas. Jean Humphrey, professor of human nutrition at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, is quoted in the Times article as saying:These children's bodies divert energy and nutrients away from growth and brain development to prioritize infection-fighting survival. When this happens during the first two years of life, children become stunted. What's particularly disturbing is that the lost height and intelligence are permanent.The Times claims that stunting affects 65 million Indian children under the age of 5, including a third of children from the country's richest families. Indian children are more malnourished than their poorer counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa. Economist Dean Spears points out:The difference in average height between Indian and African children can be explained entirely by differing concentrations of open defecation. There are far more people defecating outside in India more closely to one another's children and homes than there are in Africa or anywhere else in the world.Channels and rivers are used as open sewers.

(Photo credit: Joan Rose)Well water is stored in plastic open containers, which easily become contaminated. (Photo credit: Joan Rose)A New Cycle of Good SanitationThe situation in India reveals startling information about the link between waste pollution and stunted growth, even in a food-secure world. To help ensure a brighter future for India's youth, the nation requires an investment in waste-treatment infrastructure, including toilets and waste-water treatment. Disinfection must play a role to lower disease risks. To achieve this, India will need professionally trained operators and engineers, chemists, microbiologists, doctors and nurses trained in public health, and managers to implement universal sanitation. This new crop of professionals must come from India's youth, the segment of the population currently most at risk. The developed world must commit to sharing information and technology as part of efforts to achieve both the UN Millennium Development Goals' target on sanitation and the new post-2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Doing so will help set in motion a new cycle of good sanitation and much-improved public health in India.According to the United Nations, more children die in India than anywhere else in the world. In 2012 some 1.4 million Indian children died before reaching their fifth birthday. (Photo credit: UNICEF)U.S. Historical PerspectiveBy 1860 about 125 U.S. cities had piped water and underground sewers. While clean water was known to be important, the role of contaminated water in disease transmission was not understood, and there were few options for treating water. Chlorination, for example, would not be widely implemented until it was shown to be effective in reducing typhoid-fever rates in Jersey City, New Jersey, beginning in 1908. Nevertheless, water and waste-water treatment technology implemented in the U.S. kept pace with scientific discovery, enabling public-health protection for millions of residents. We must celebrate and continually support the building and upgrading of our toilets, sewers and treatment plants in the U.S. that protect our water and our health. India, with its 1.2 billion people, now faces a water and sanitation crisis that will take decades to address.

13,LATINO VOICES,This Is How We Know DACA Didn't Cause The Border Crisis,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-border-crisis_n_5639383.html,,2014-08-01,"Immigrants who have been detained while crossing the border are housed inside the McAllen Border Patrol Station in McAllen, Texas, Tuesday July 15, 2014. A solution for the growing crisis of tens of thousands of unaccompanied children showing up at the U.S.-Mexico border is looking increasingly elusive with three weeks left before Congress leaves Washington for an annual August recess. (AP Photo/Los Angeles Times, Rick Loomis, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae9f2026000036008140b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since October, some 57,000 unaccompanied minors -- the vast majority from Central America -- have crossed illegally into the United States. Many Republicans are blaming the crisis on President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which allows people brought here illegally as children work authorization and relief from deportation. Conservatives say the policy, which newly arrived undocumented immigrants don’t qualify for, has acted as a magnet, pulling young migrants from the violence-plagued and poverty-stricken countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. But there’s virtually no evidence to support this increasingly popular conservative talking point. Immigration hardliners within the Republican Party have always despised DACA, viewing it as an overstepping of presidential authority and an affront to their enforcement-first attitude. Since the crisis, however, they’ve lashed out with renewed force. DACA is basically an adaptation of Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) idea for a conservative alternative to the DREAM Act. Now, even he says DACA should be rescinded, calling for a policy that basically amounts to deporting more Dreamers. To make their case, conservatives generally use two arguments. First, they point out that the child migrants often think they’ll be allowed to stay. Second, they say DACA must be responsible for the crisis because the sharp rise in the number of unaccompanied minors crossing illegally roughly coincides with the implementation of DACA in June 2012. Neither argument holds water. Conservatives have made much of the fact that those crossing the border are under the impression that once they arrive in the U.S., they’ll receive a “permiso,” or permit. That must mean they’re aware of DACA, Republicans like U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) argue. That’s not what journalists who have spoken to migrant families are saying. According to reports from the border, the “permiso” people are referring to is a notice to appear in immigration court. It’s easy to understand how Central Americans may misconstrue the meaning of a notice to appear. Because unaccompanied minors may await their court date outside detention, they are normally permitted to reunite with family members in the U.S. Due to the tremendous backlog in our immigration courts, it could be years before their cases are resolved. The “permiso” phenomenon isn’t new. Operation Streamline, the program that jails immigrants for crossing the border illegally before deporting them, arose out of a similar bottleneck in the immigration system. Around 2004, the Del Rio sector of the Texas border with Mexico ran out of detention bed space for Central Americans, who by law could not immediately be repatriated like Mexicans. According to the California Law Review, Central Americans “began walking up to Border Patrol agents in Eagle Pass and asking for a Notice to Appear, which they sometimes referred to as a ‘permiso’ (or permit).” That was eight years before DACA, so it’s fairly certain that the policy isn’t behind the “permiso” phenomenon. But what of the fact that that the numbers have risen so sharply since the Obama administration implemented DACA? It’s undeniable that the numbers have grown. Some 15,700 unaccompanied minors entered illegally in 2011, while more than 57,000 have entered so far this year. But correlation isn’t the same as causation. A closer look reveals that the upward trend predates DACA. Vox traces the beginning of the uptick to the fall of 2011 -- more than a year before DACA. By April 2012, several months before the announcement of DACA in June of that year, child migrants were placed in Lackland Air Force base because they had overwhelmed the shelter space available to them. The fact of the matter is that all the elements were in place for a large-scale movement of Central American kids across the border, with or without DACA. Rising street violence in Central America, along with political instability in Honduras gave people a reason to leave. Previous migratory patterns established since the late-1970s -- first for political reasons, then for economic ones -- meant many Central American youths have family here in the United States. And a hole in our immigration enforcement system was exploited both by families desperate to bring their children here and by human traffickers eager to profit from their predicament. In addition to being based on a fallacy, the GOP’s call to fight this crisis with more border security would do nothing to solve the problem. These children aren’t a security threat. They’re turning themselves in to U.S. authorities at the border.Some 550,000 people benefit from DACA today. Because of the policy, they can work in the only country they know as home and can live with a modicum of security, knowing that -- at least for now -- they don’t have to face the perpetual fear of deportation. Conservatives want to take that away, even though there’s no compelling reason to believe it would stem the border crisis or have any other positive effect. "

17,COLLEGE,New Bill Would Shed Daylight On Schools Under Investigation For Sexual Violence,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-rape-bill_n_5637967.html,,2014-08-01,"Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., talks to reporters about the NTSB findings on the gas pipeline which exploded in San Bruno, Calif., a suburb of San Francisco, after a hearing at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Washington, Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2011.

Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) and Patrick Meehan (R-Penn.) introduced a third bill, the Hold Accountable and Lend Transparency Act. Nicknamed the HALT Act, the bill includes several components similar to those found in the other proposals, such as requiring schools to conduct annual climate surveys, increasing the penalties for offenders who violate existing campus safety laws, and establishing more requirements for colleges to notify students of their rights under the gender equity statute Title IX.The HALT Act would also put greater pressure on the Education Department with regard to its investigations of colleges suspected of violating the law. Speier and Meehan's bill would require the department to publish a list of institutions under investigation for possible violations of the Clery Act, a campus safety law -- something the department currently does not do.Right now, two separate offices within the Department of Education, answering to two different supervisors, handle campus sex assault investigations. One is the Office for Civil Rights, which handles Title IX inquiries and recently started disclosing the names of the schools it is reviewing. The other is the Federal Student Aid office, which oversees investigations under the Clery Act and does not publicize anything about its activities until a financial penalty has been issued.Advocates and sexual assault survivors are frustrated they can't even get the Education Department to acknowledge if there's a list of universities being reviewed for Clery violations. There is no statute preventing such disclosure, but there is no law requiring it either. ""I don't understand how disclosing Title IX investigations is in any way different than disclosing the Clery Act investigations in terms of it affecting the process,"" said S. Daniel Carter, director of the 32 National Campus Safety Initiative at the VTV Family Outreach Foundation. ""If it's not a problem with Title IX investigations, it shouldn't be a problem for Clery investigations.""Dorie Nolt, a spokeswoman at the Department of Education, told The Huffington Post that the FSA does not divulge the names of the schools under review in order to preserve the integrity of the investigations.""The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) has a longstanding policy of not publicly disclosing the names of schools it is reviewing under the Clery Act,"" Nolt wrote in an email. ""If a school publicly announces it first, FSA will confirm.""Under the HALT Act, the Education Department would get upward of $5 million in additional funding for investigations, as well as a task force to increase coordination among the agencies within the department handling these cases.Like the other bills introduced Wednesday, the HALT Act raises the possibility of fining colleges that violate Title IX. But Speier and Meehan's legislation does not stipulate how much a school could be fined. By contrast, one of the other bills introduced Wednesday stipulates that schools would be fined up to 1 percent of an institution's operating budget per Title IX violation.Sexual assault survivors, especially those filing the current wave of complaints accusing schools of botching rape cases, say they're tired of not knowing whether the arm of the Education Department with the power to fine colleges is even conducting investigations.Early on in what would become a flurry of survivor activism, it was confirmed in early 2013 that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Occidental College were both facing Clery reviews. But when nine students filed a Clery complaint against the University of California, Berkeley in May 2013, they never heard anything back from the Education Department. This February, when 31 current and former Berkeley students filed a Title IX complaint on many of the same issues, the original group of nine students faulted the federal government for not taking action on their earlier filing.Lead complainant Sofie Karasek, a junior at Berkeley, accused the Education Department at the time of being guilty of the same ""deliberate indifference"" as her school.""It is unacceptable that as we wait for the federal government to respond to our complaint, more students are being sexually assaulted, and continue to have their cases dismissed, mishandled and ignored if they choose to report them,"" Karasek said.Know Your IX, a survivor advocacy group that has worked with Karasek, said in a statement Thursday that the HALT Act would be needed to codify ""openness"" and ""ensure continued transparency in future administrations.""

Asked about the omission of Lady Stoneheart from Season 4 of the HBO show, the actress said:That was a massive deal, but honestly, I really like it. I’m so sick of going on the Internet and seeing all the book readers being snobby, spoiling it for other people, then saying, 'Well, it’s not a spoiler. The books have been out for years.' Like, couldn’t you just stop being mad for a second and let other people enjoy the show?Ouch. Maisie must be listening to Jon Snow because she definitely just stuck haters with the pointy end.Williams went on to say that book readers have a right to feel an attachment to the original story, but they don't need to deride the show or its fans because it is different. She also said that insecurities about ""not knowing what will happen next"" may be the cause of their hostility.It looks like some people should definitely be careful, or Arya may be adding a few more names to her bedtime list.[h/t Uproxx]"
