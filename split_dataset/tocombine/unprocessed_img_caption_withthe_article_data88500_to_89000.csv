If you haven't had sangria before, open up your thirsty palate. Traditional Spanish Sangria is an iced wine cocktail made in a pitcher, adding apples, oranges, lemons, limes, and sometimes a splash of either brandy, Cointreau, or triple sec. To refresh the typical sangria recipe, I'm juicing it up with a California twist using fresh fruits and herbs. A trip to my local farmers' market sets me off on a sangria making adventure. I'm wandering through the market stalls, gawking at blue punnets full of toppling blackberries and red raspberries. Berries always look pretty in a cocktail glass, so I buy some. At the next stall, I'm seduced by the aromatic scents of basil and lemon verbena. The market vendor hands me flowering hyssop, as he's sold out of the borage flowers I asked for. The blossoms are bright periwinkle fading into violet blue. A handful of lemon verbena and basil intoxicates my senses with their fragrance. I fill up my canvas bag with bouquets of herbs and edible flowers. A fig vendor hands me tastes of fresh strawberry figs, tearing one in half with his hands. I eat each one he gives me, marveling at the flavor and texture. I take home everything I can fit into my bag and probably more than I'll need. Traditional sangria made with fresh fruit juice becomes something altogether marvelous. I've chosen tangerines and peaches to juice for these two recipes, but you can add your own choice of fruit if you'd like, such as oranges. There are no steadfast rules when it comes to making Sangria. Sangria made with white wine or champagne it is called Sangria Blanco, so you can wear your summery whites without concern. Rioja is the red wine that is used in classic sangria. Once home from the market, I spread out my bounty. Since I prefer champagne rather than red or white wine, I pop a bottle of bubbly open. Ice cubes clatter into the glass. I place a leaf of lemon verbena inside, then a tiny strawberry. I blend up some fresh fruit juice and add a little bit to my glass, then pour in some champagne. Once garnished with fresh fruit slices, herbs and edible flowers, it's ready for serving. My glass is bountiful with raspberries, blackberries, little wild strawberries, edible flowers and a lemon verbena leaf. I also added a touch of pear-flavored balsamic into the glass. I'm completely addicted to good balsamic crème so I cannot help but add it to my drink.The possibilities are endless when matching a wine with one of the juices.  It can even be served as a mocktail using sparkling water rather than champagne. Pour it all over ice, add in a few garnishes and you've got sensual gratification. Depending on what's in season at your local farmers' market, you can add your own touch to these sangria recipes. I hope it inspires you.How to make your own juicy Sangria: 1) Begin with wine or champagne. White wine, Rosé and champagne shows off the fruits in your glass. Red wine (Rioja) is the classic choice. If non-alcoholic, choose sparkling water. 2) Blend up some juice. If you have a juicer, make your favorite blend.  3) Add fresh fruits sliced up pretty for your glass. Bright colors make it sparkle. 4) Garnish with edible flowers and/or herbs like lemon verbena, basil, mint.Try these two recipes to get your Sangria pitchers started:CALIFORNIA GARDEN SANGRIAThis sparkling sangria uses champagne, fresh tangerine and peach juice, Meyer lemon slices, and fragrant orange blossom water. All pair perfectly in combination with fresh juice. Coconut water lends a refreshing flavor to this drink. Just a drizzle of balsamic crème and you are barefoot in your own garden of delight.

Keep this drink simple with fresh peaches and oranges. It is just as intoxicating without the alcohol as a blended mocktail. The scent of orange blossom is truly a pleasure. Coconut water, fresh peaches and juicy oranges over ice, garnished delicately with a few raspberries and/or strawberry. This looks so luxurious.

The following tasks help me each and every time I would like to conquer my fears.",2015-05-22,2015-05-22-1432278557-5326336-Kpernyfot201505229.12.52.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-22-1432278557-5326336-Kpernyfot201505229.12.52-thumb.png,"Why is it so difficult to let go of our fears? How much easier life would be if we dared to go ahead and we would not worry about everything. You should let go of your fears, not stick to them. It is difficult to know what belongs to you, as you often do not even realize that you have adopted something, and at the same time you consider things as your reality which have nothing to do with reality. Notice what does not belong to you, that is holding you back and eliminate it from your life; do not let it slow you down. The following tasks help me each and every time I would like to conquer my fears.1. Write down your fearsIf you have the courage to write them down, you are halfway there. Lot of fears are eating us from the inside, and we are so used to them that we don't even realize they exist. They are hidden in our words and in our beliefs. We have made them part of our lives, but remember: you shouldn't stick to your fears, you should let them go. 2. Go into detailsWrite down the main areas of your life and make lists of your blockages. This task will help you dig even deeper into your fears. I know, you still say that this task is not for you, but if you follow the five steps, you will soon realize it is only your ego tricking you. From your job to you career and to your relationships, take a look at the things that might hold you back. Think of the reasons why you are not taking certain steps.   Don't forget: your circumstances keep changing all the time, don't camp in the past. Just because something could not happen last year, it might happen this year. 3. AnalyzeNow that you have a list of your fears, deal with them one by one. Why are you afraid of it? Because if you don't succeed, it's a failure? Why are you afraid of failure? What kind of image do you have of failure? How were you treated in the past when you failed? The attitude and the experience you associate with the specific events are important. If in your case it is negative, you only have to change that. The following stories will help you with that.I know people who have been competing a lot since they were kids, and when they didn't win, their parents praised them anyhow and told them that it was also a part of the journey. If you want to be very good, you have to make a lot of mistakes; it is only the cowards that don't try. It is a myth that you are good only if you do everything perfectly. I think it works this way: you accept that you make mistakes, but you learn, because you WANT to grow.   The second story: a boy told me once that when he accidentally broke a glass as a child, his mother would start to scream her lungs out and say ""how clumsy you are, son!"" All through his childhood, this boy convinced himself that he is clumsy, because his mother said so, and he has been afraid he might break a glass ever since. Is it a realistic fear? No. Nevertheless, he hates eating out, since he is afraid it will happen again. I asked him to talk about this with his mother. It turned out that her mother simply got a heart attack every time, because when she was a child a wall collapsed behind her back, and since then if anything breaks around her, her reaction is like that. It also turned out that she was also worried that her son might get hurt.  You see how much depends on whether you communicate with others in a clear way? But for this, you need to know your fears and to know how the events of your past influence the present. 4. Change your viewpointFace them! Now that you have elaborated on the exact causes of your fears, think about it: is it a realistic fear? What will happen if you fail? Nothing - but if you don't even try, you will think about it for the rest of your life, WHAT IF? I wouldn't wish this kind of life on anyone. Once your attitude is changed, here comes the next step: you should face your fear.E.g. ""I'm afraid I won't be enough."" - Why do you think so?  E.g. ""My mother always told me no-one would want me,"" ""My ex-partner told me I would never find anyone better than him,"" etc.  - Is my fear real? What do I think? Write down your opinion honestly, why you think you are not enough. If you always write ""I'm unlucky in this"", ""every man is an asshole"", ""I'll be fooled again, no matter what"" and the like, than look a bit further: what happens if you don't succeed the first or second time? Nothing. Is every man really an asshole? Surely not. If you know only one who isn't, you should hope that there are more. This can't be your attitude, since you will get what is in your head. And finally: why would you be fooled again? Just because you failed an exam once, you won't fail again. Just because you got lost in a city once, you won't necessarily get lost again. Think about it. We always learn and grow.Why isn't your attitude like this: the more times you are fooled and the more negative experience you have, the easier it will be in the long run to see who can stay and who should go. After a while you will be able to spot the people you have nothing to do with you in no time, and you will be able to save many weeks, months, years and great disappointments. Let things happen the way they are supposed to happen, and don't rule out the possibility that something might turn out good at the end of the day. I know it is difficult to believe that you deserve good things, but it is worth a try.  5. Always have a plan B A Plan B will calm you down. It will take the pressure off of you, and FINALLY you can relax. What if, for example, you never find Mr. Right or you don't have anyone for years? That isn't a tragedy either. I get plenty of letters from readers saying they are alone, and don't even have the chance to get to know people, but they would like to be with someone. What if you get to know and love yourself first? What if you discover and polish your skills? If you end up alone, make use of the valuable time you have received - let me add, not by coincidence. At times like this you can move on faster than when you have someone on your side. Shape your attitude, one without desperation. Accept the situation you are in and make the most of it. From the very moment you accept what you have and you decide that, not everyone has to live according to the expectations of society after all, you will be free from desperation and fear. This is called letting go. This is about ""I've done everything I could and I accept what I have and won't fight it anymore. It will happen when it happens, and until then I 'm enjoying life."" Opportunities are stifled by clinging, but if you are open minded and receptive, miracles will come... and we have all heard stories like ""it happened exactly when I had given up hope."" Well, something like this happens before that. Have something to add to this story?  E-mail me: oravecz.nora@gmail.com instagram.com/oravecznoraofficial"
3,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Even Republicans Aren't Happy With The New GOP-Led Congress,"Mark Blumenthal, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-dissatisfied-_n_7420432.html,,2015-05-22,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY, speaks during a signing ceremony for the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act on February 13, 2015 in the Rayburn Room of the US Capitol in Washington, DC.

Fox looks to the polls to narrow down contenders in the GOP debate, which could present some problems. And a new case of survey fraud underscores the need for greater transparency. This is HuffPollster for Friday, May 22, 2015.AMERICANS OF BOTH PARTIES ARE UNSATISFIED WITH THE NEW REPUBLICAN CONGRESS- Pew Research: ""The new Republican-led Congress is drawing harsh reviews from the public – including most Republicans….Unlike after some previous partisan turnovers on Capitol Hill, negative assessments of the new Congress now cross party lines. Today, just 41% of Republicans approve of the job their party’s leaders in Congress are doing. By comparison, in April 2011, 60% of Republicans approved of GOP leaders’ job performance and in April 1995, 78% approved of GOP leadership’s policies and proposals….their party’s leaders at the 100-day mark in 2007, when 60% said Democratic leaders were keeping their campaign promises. Currently, Republicans (36%) are about as likely as Democrats (38%) or independents (38%) to say Congress is accomplishing less than they expected….[The] shift in opinion is primarily seen among conservative Republicans: 54% approved of GOP congressional leaders’ job performance in February, today just 41% approve."" [Pew]FOX WILL LET THE POLLS DECIDE WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN GOP DEBATE - Matea Gold: The network will require contenders to place in the top 10 in an average of the five most recent national polls in the run-up to the event, narrowing what is expected to be a field of 16 or more by the Aug. 6 event in Cleveland. The rule could trigger an early rush of spending by lower-tier candidates seeking to boost their standing in national surveys before the pivotal first forum. Meanwhile, CNN laid out a different approach for the second debate on Sept. 16, which will be split into two parts — one featuring the top 10 candidates in public polling and a second that will include lower-tiered candidates who garner at least 1 percent in polls."" [WashPost] More on using polls to select debate participants: -Jason Linkins looks at who would make the Fox cut-off based on current poll numbers. [HuffPost]-Harry Enten examines how different poll averages could lead to different candidates getting into Republican debates. [538]-Jonathan Bernstein predicts ""gimmicks, stunts and...attention-grabbing device[s]"" by Republican campaigns on the debate ""bubble."" [Bloomberg]POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDY RETRACTED FOR FRAUD - Lila Shapiro and Natalie Jackson: ""A seemingly groundbreaking and widely publicized study reported in Science magazine this past December may be a fake. The study appeared to show that openly gay activists in California had persuaded conservative voters to change their minds in a lasting way by engaging the voters in 'heartfelt, reciprocal and vulnerable conversations' about being gay during door-to-door advocacy campaigns. It was co-authored by Michael J. LaCour, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Donald P. Green, a professor at Columbia University....But according to a report issued Tuesday by two University of California, Berkeley, graduate students and a Yale professor, there are enough questions about the data to warrant retracting the study. Retraction Watch broke the story Wednesday about what students David Broockman (soon to be an assistant professor at Stanford) and Joshua Kalla and Yale professor Peter Aronow found....Initially, LaCour claimed he had accidentally deleted the file with the necessary information, but again Qualtrics said it could not verify that the data had been deleted or that the study took place. It seemed increasingly clear to Green that no follow-up surveys had ever been conducted and that LaCour may have taken data from existing studies and manipulated the numbers to achieve the results he wanted."" [HuffPost, Brookman, et. al., Retraction Watch ]Green requests retraction: More from Shapiro and Jackson: ""Green told The Huffington Post that he was shocked and dismayed by the revelations about the data set. 'There was a mountain of fabrication,' he said. “Graphs and charts and anecdotes and stories of every possible sort about these surveys. So it didn’t occur to me that the whole thing was fabricated because every time I had a question, it seemed as though [LaCour] had an answer.” Green has since issued a retraction of the study. LaCour, for his part, declined a request for an interview from The Huffington Post. 'I’m gathering evidence and relevant information so I can provide a single comprehensive response. I will do so at my earliest opportunity,' he wrote in an email.""No evidence of funding - Virginia Hughes: ""In the study’s acknowledgements, LaCour states that he received funding from three organizations — the Ford Foundation, Williams Institute at UCLA, and the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr., Fund. But when contacted by BuzzFeed News, all three funders denied having any involvement with LaCour and his work. (In 2012, the Haas, Jr. Fund gave a grant to the Los Angeles LGBT Center related to their canvassing work, but the Center said that LaCour’s involvement did not begin until 2013.)"" [Buzzfeed]FiveThirtyEight: 'Retraction shows...we're all vulnerable to faked data'... - Carl Bialik: ""The significance of the retraction was hotly debated Wednesday in political science circles and among other scientists. Some saw a positive story about how academia polices itself. 'This episode demonstrates how science is self-correcting,' the researchers who wrote the paper debunking the Science article wrote in a joint emailed response to questions. 'We hope that this incident will further spur the open-science and data transparency movements.' To others, though, the episode was far more troubling. The debunkers could do their debunking only because of a bit of luck: Data they needed happened to be available not from its original source, but through another researcher who had posted it to meet a journal’s open-data policies. And they weren’t specifically trying to replicate the Science study to see whether it held up. They were trying to extend the study, and grew suspicious when their early results didn’t line up."" [538]...but 'science works' - Rice University political scientist Rick Wilson on lessons learned: ""[Science works. Will Moore makes this point quite nicely. If someone has a new and interesting finding, it should never be taken as the last word. Science requires skepticism. While I teach my students that they should be their own worst critic, this is not enough. The process of peer review (as much as it might be disparaged) provides some opportunity for skepticism. The most important source of skepticism, however, should come from the research community. A finding, especially one that is novel, needs to be replicated...Andrew Gelman makes this point on the Monkey Cage. We should be cautious when we see a finding that stands out. It should attract research attention and be “stress-tested” by others. The positive outcome of many different researchers focusing on a problem is that it allows us to calibrate the value of a finding and it should deter misconduct."" [RKWRice] Implications for public polls? - Pre-election polling has had its own painful episodes of fraud, most notably the infamous cases of Strategic Vision LLC and Research 2000. The most notable reaction to those cases has been the Transparency Initiative of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), an effort to create incentives for pollsters and media organizations to disclose basic methodological information about their publicly released surveys. Some may criticize AAPOR's initiative as stopping short of requiring release of micro-data -- the sort of data that allowed Brookman and Kalla to make their case against the LaCour-Green study -- but it is a start. It requires, among other things, disclosure of both the organization that conducted the survey and those that sponsored it. Such disclosures were instrumental in raising concerns about LaCour's case through calls to the organizations that purportedly provided funding for the study and to Qualtrics, the firm that LaCour claimed had conducted his surveys. New statement from LaCour - Buzzfeed has updated their story with the following email message sent from LaCour on Friday morning: ""I will supply a definitive response on or before May 29, 2015. I appreciate your patience, as I gather evidence and relevant information, since I only became aware of the allegations about my work on the evening of May 19, 2015, when the not peer-reviewed comments in ‘Irregularities in LaCour (2014),’ were posted publicly online. I must note, however, that despite what many have printed, Science has not published a retraction of my article with Professor Green. I sent a statement to Science Editor McNutt this evening, providing information as to why I stand by the findings in LaCour & Green (2014). I’ve requested that if Science editor McNutt publishes Professor’s Green’s retraction request, she publish my statement with it.” [Buzzfeed via @virginiahughes]VOTERS GIVE NEGATIVE RATINGS TO SOMEONE THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF -Yoni Appelbaum: ""Pity Emily Farris. Republican primary voters just don’t like her very much. In a survey released on Wednesday, Public Policy Polling found that Farris near the bottom of the GOP field. She polled well behind fellow Texans Rick Perry and Ted Cruz. Just 3 percent of voters had formed a favorable opinion of her, while 20 percent reported unfavorable views...And Farris isn’t even running. She’s a political science professor at Texas Christian University, whose name was included within the enormous field of Republican hopefuls as a statistical control... It’s well-established that voters will volunteer views concerning wholly fictitious issues or candidates...Voters can be reluctant to confess ignorance, or conflate invented laws or candidates with real ones."" [The Atlantic]HOW MODE EFFECT IMPACTS SURVEY RESULTS - Pew: ""Among the most striking trends in the field of survey research in the past two decades is the shift from interviewer-administered to self-administered surveys. Fueled by the growth of the internet, self-administration as a survey mode presents a mixture of opportunities and challenges to the field…[T]he results from self-administered and interviewer-administered surveys are sometimes different. This difference is called a mode effect, a difference in responses to a survey question attributable to the mode in which the question is administered.... The study finds that differences in responses by survey mode are fairly common, but typically not large, with a mean difference of 5.5 percentage points and a median difference of five points across the 60 questions…Where differences occurred, they were especially large on three broad types of questions: Items that asked the respondent to assess the quality of their family and social life produced differences of 18 and 14 percentage points, respectively, with those interviewed on the phone reporting higher levels of satisfaction than those who completed the survey on the Web..Questions about societal discrimination against several different groups also produced large differences...Web respondents were far more likely than those interviewed on the phone to give various political figures a “very unfavorable” rating, a tendency that was concentrated among members of the opposite party of each figure rated."" [Pew]MASSACHUSETTS VOTERS MISREPORT THEIR PARTY REGISTRATION - In a paper presented at last weeks AAPOR Conference, MassINC's Steve Koczela and Rich Parr compared respondents actual party registration status taken from official records to self-reported questions about registration and party identification. They found ""a substantial minority of voters misreport their own party registration, and many self-identify with a party with which they are not registered.""

4,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Even Republicans Aren't Happy With The New GOP-Led Congress,"Mark Blumenthal, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-dissatisfied-_n_7420432.html,,2015-05-22,2015-05-22-1432296455-4546462-YouGovIraqSupportRecall.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-22-1432296455-4546462-YouGovIraqSupportRecall.png," Democrats and Republicans alike are unhappy with the GOP-led Congress. Fox looks to the polls to narrow down contenders in the GOP debate, which could present some problems. And a new case of survey fraud underscores the need for greater transparency. This is HuffPollster for Friday, May 22, 2015.AMERICANS OF BOTH PARTIES ARE UNSATISFIED WITH THE NEW REPUBLICAN CONGRESS- Pew Research: ""The new Republican-led Congress is drawing harsh reviews from the public – including most Republicans….Unlike after some previous partisan turnovers on Capitol Hill, negative assessments of the new Congress now cross party lines. Today, just 41% of Republicans approve of the job their party’s leaders in Congress are doing. By comparison, in April 2011, 60% of Republicans approved of GOP leaders’ job performance and in April 1995, 78% approved of GOP leadership’s policies and proposals….their party’s leaders at the 100-day mark in 2007, when 60% said Democratic leaders were keeping their campaign promises. Currently, Republicans (36%) are about as likely as Democrats (38%) or independents (38%) to say Congress is accomplishing less than they expected….[The] shift in opinion is primarily seen among conservative Republicans: 54% approved of GOP congressional leaders’ job performance in February, today just 41% approve."" [Pew]FOX WILL LET THE POLLS DECIDE WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN GOP DEBATE - Matea Gold: The network will require contenders to place in the top 10 in an average of the five most recent national polls in the run-up to the event, narrowing what is expected to be a field of 16 or more by the Aug. 6 event in Cleveland. The rule could trigger an early rush of spending by lower-tier candidates seeking to boost their standing in national surveys before the pivotal first forum. Meanwhile, CNN laid out a different approach for the second debate on Sept. 16, which will be split into two parts — one featuring the top 10 candidates in public polling and a second that will include lower-tiered candidates who garner at least 1 percent in polls."" [WashPost] More on using polls to select debate participants: -Jason Linkins looks at who would make the Fox cut-off based on current poll numbers. [HuffPost]-Harry Enten examines how different poll averages could lead to different candidates getting into Republican debates. [538]-Jonathan Bernstein predicts ""gimmicks, stunts and...attention-grabbing device[s]"" by Republican campaigns on the debate ""bubble."" [Bloomberg]POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDY RETRACTED FOR FRAUD - Lila Shapiro and Natalie Jackson: ""A seemingly groundbreaking and widely publicized study reported in Science magazine this past December may be a fake. The study appeared to show that openly gay activists in California had persuaded conservative voters to change their minds in a lasting way by engaging the voters in 'heartfelt, reciprocal and vulnerable conversations' about being gay during door-to-door advocacy campaigns. It was co-authored by Michael J. LaCour, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Donald P. Green, a professor at Columbia University....But according to a report issued Tuesday by two University of California, Berkeley, graduate students and a Yale professor, there are enough questions about the data to warrant retracting the study. Retraction Watch broke the story Wednesday about what students David Broockman (soon to be an assistant professor at Stanford) and Joshua Kalla and Yale professor Peter Aronow found....Initially, LaCour claimed he had accidentally deleted the file with the necessary information, but again Qualtrics said it could not verify that the data had been deleted or that the study took place. It seemed increasingly clear to Green that no follow-up surveys had ever been conducted and that LaCour may have taken data from existing studies and manipulated the numbers to achieve the results he wanted."" [HuffPost, Brookman, et. al., Retraction Watch ]Green requests retraction: More from Shapiro and Jackson: ""Green told The Huffington Post that he was shocked and dismayed by the revelations about the data set. 'There was a mountain of fabrication,' he said. “Graphs and charts and anecdotes and stories of every possible sort about these surveys. So it didn’t occur to me that the whole thing was fabricated because every time I had a question, it seemed as though [LaCour] had an answer.” Green has since issued a retraction of the study. LaCour, for his part, declined a request for an interview from The Huffington Post. 'I’m gathering evidence and relevant information so I can provide a single comprehensive response. I will do so at my earliest opportunity,' he wrote in an email.""No evidence of funding - Virginia Hughes: ""In the study’s acknowledgements, LaCour states that he received funding from three organizations — the Ford Foundation, Williams Institute at UCLA, and the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr., Fund. But when contacted by BuzzFeed News, all three funders denied having any involvement with LaCour and his work. (In 2012, the Haas, Jr. Fund gave a grant to the Los Angeles LGBT Center related to their canvassing work, but the Center said that LaCour’s involvement did not begin until 2013.)"" [Buzzfeed]FiveThirtyEight: 'Retraction shows...we're all vulnerable to faked data'... - Carl Bialik: ""The significance of the retraction was hotly debated Wednesday in political science circles and among other scientists. Some saw a positive story about how academia polices itself. 'This episode demonstrates how science is self-correcting,' the researchers who wrote the paper debunking the Science article wrote in a joint emailed response to questions. 'We hope that this incident will further spur the open-science and data transparency movements.' To others, though, the episode was far more troubling. The debunkers could do their debunking only because of a bit of luck: Data they needed happened to be available not from its original source, but through another researcher who had posted it to meet a journal’s open-data policies. And they weren’t specifically trying to replicate the Science study to see whether it held up. They were trying to extend the study, and grew suspicious when their early results didn’t line up."" [538]...but 'science works' - Rice University political scientist Rick Wilson on lessons learned: ""[Science works. Will Moore makes this point quite nicely. If someone has a new and interesting finding, it should never be taken as the last word. Science requires skepticism. While I teach my students that they should be their own worst critic, this is not enough. The process of peer review (as much as it might be disparaged) provides some opportunity for skepticism. The most important source of skepticism, however, should come from the research community. A finding, especially one that is novel, needs to be replicated...Andrew Gelman makes this point on the Monkey Cage. We should be cautious when we see a finding that stands out. It should attract research attention and be “stress-tested” by others. The positive outcome of many different researchers focusing on a problem is that it allows us to calibrate the value of a finding and it should deter misconduct."" [RKWRice] Implications for public polls? - Pre-election polling has had its own painful episodes of fraud, most notably the infamous cases of Strategic Vision LLC and Research 2000. The most notable reaction to those cases has been the Transparency Initiative of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), an effort to create incentives for pollsters and media organizations to disclose basic methodological information about their publicly released surveys. Some may criticize AAPOR's initiative as stopping short of requiring release of micro-data -- the sort of data that allowed Brookman and Kalla to make their case against the LaCour-Green study -- but it is a start. It requires, among other things, disclosure of both the organization that conducted the survey and those that sponsored it. Such disclosures were instrumental in raising concerns about LaCour's case through calls to the organizations that purportedly provided funding for the study and to Qualtrics, the firm that LaCour claimed had conducted his surveys. New statement from LaCour - Buzzfeed has updated their story with the following email message sent from LaCour on Friday morning: ""I will supply a definitive response on or before May 29, 2015. I appreciate your patience, as I gather evidence and relevant information, since I only became aware of the allegations about my work on the evening of May 19, 2015, when the not peer-reviewed comments in ‘Irregularities in LaCour (2014),’ were posted publicly online. I must note, however, that despite what many have printed, Science has not published a retraction of my article with Professor Green. I sent a statement to Science Editor McNutt this evening, providing information as to why I stand by the findings in LaCour & Green (2014). I’ve requested that if Science editor McNutt publishes Professor’s Green’s retraction request, she publish my statement with it.” [Buzzfeed via @virginiahughes]VOTERS GIVE NEGATIVE RATINGS TO SOMEONE THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF -Yoni Appelbaum: ""Pity Emily Farris. Republican primary voters just don’t like her very much. In a survey released on Wednesday, Public Policy Polling found that Farris near the bottom of the GOP field. She polled well behind fellow Texans Rick Perry and Ted Cruz. Just 3 percent of voters had formed a favorable opinion of her, while 20 percent reported unfavorable views...And Farris isn’t even running. She’s a political science professor at Texas Christian University, whose name was included within the enormous field of Republican hopefuls as a statistical control... It’s well-established that voters will volunteer views concerning wholly fictitious issues or candidates...Voters can be reluctant to confess ignorance, or conflate invented laws or candidates with real ones."" [The Atlantic]HOW MODE EFFECT IMPACTS SURVEY RESULTS - Pew: ""Among the most striking trends in the field of survey research in the past two decades is the shift from interviewer-administered to self-administered surveys. Fueled by the growth of the internet, self-administration as a survey mode presents a mixture of opportunities and challenges to the field…[T]he results from self-administered and interviewer-administered surveys are sometimes different. This difference is called a mode effect, a difference in responses to a survey question attributable to the mode in which the question is administered.... The study finds that differences in responses by survey mode are fairly common, but typically not large, with a mean difference of 5.5 percentage points and a median difference of five points across the 60 questions…Where differences occurred, they were especially large on three broad types of questions: Items that asked the respondent to assess the quality of their family and social life produced differences of 18 and 14 percentage points, respectively, with those interviewed on the phone reporting higher levels of satisfaction than those who completed the survey on the Web..Questions about societal discrimination against several different groups also produced large differences...Web respondents were far more likely than those interviewed on the phone to give various political figures a “very unfavorable” rating, a tendency that was concentrated among members of the opposite party of each figure rated."" [Pew]MASSACHUSETTS VOTERS MISREPORT THEIR PARTY REGISTRATION - In a paper presented at last weeks AAPOR Conference, MassINC's Steve Koczela and Rich Parr compared respondents actual party registration status taken from official records to self-reported questions about registration and party identification. They found ""a substantial minority of voters misreport their own party registration, and many self-identify with a party with which they are not registered."" [MassINC]AMERICANS NOW SAY THEY NEVER SUPPORTED IRAQ WAR - Kathy Frankovic: ""Americans’ memories of their own past beliefs about the 2003 Iraq War are tinged with their current feelings about what has taken place there since and what is taking place there now.

Most teachers don't believe in rote learning and encourage students to be creative.""  -- Zhu XiaohuShanghai is the largest city in China; who in education is not aware of the fact that this city's students finished at the top of the charts in the PISA 2009 exam? Since then, educators from all over the world have travelled to this dynamic city to better understand the strategies that have kept Shanghai at the forefront of education reform. The first thing you note as an observer in Shanghai is that education success has much to do with societal and family beliefs in the immense value of being well-educated. China has a long tradition of respect for education. Exams are still a very important part of the learning process but what else are educators working on to improve the students' education experience and promote a 21st century approach to learning? On a recent trip to the city, I had the pleasure of meeting with Xu Jinjie, (Lecturer at Shanghai Normal University) and Zhu Xiaohu (PHD Candidate Assistant Professor - Institute for Basic Education Research, Shanghai Academy of Educational Sciences) to discuss some of the ways China is combining the best of tradition with innovation.One of the key headlines we see on Chinese Education in the West is that Chinese students excel in the global standardized tests. There are, however, some writers that find deficiencies in China's education system. Do you think these criticisms are valid?Zhu Xiaohu: China's education system is always reforming. For example, in PISA 2009, we found that Chinese students don't like rote learning in math. Most teachers don't believe in rote learning and encourage students to be creative. But examinations have a thousand year old history in China. So it is deeply engrained in the culture. And I don't believe that tests are always a bad thing. It is about the content of the test. We want to give students more chances and more choices when they take examinations. For example, we are now doing some work on this in Zhejiang province in Shanghai. It's a pilot for a new student achievement assessment, which will be more about producing a portfolio.  ""You have to consider this question of test reform in context, though. In the developed regions of China such as Shanghai, our government is starting to reconsider strict testing practices, but in the rural areas, doing well on strict testing is the only way for the poor children to proceed."" -- Xu JinjieThere are a lot of teachers around the world that would love to hear more about that.Xu Jinjie: I think you have to consider this question of test reform in context, though. In the developed regions of China such as Shanghai, our government is starting to reconsider strict testing practices, but in the rural areas, doing well on strict testing is the only way for the poor children to proceed.What do you think about the way technology continues to change the way students learn, which is allowing students more access to information anytime, anyplace, anywhere?Xu Jinjie: We believe that basic knowledge and basic skills, even with the technology changing our world, are still key parts of school learning. Take for example, the multiplication tables, they are very special in China. Every student in primary school has to memorize them. Even though we know that they can calculate with a calculator or a computer, we ask our students to remember their multiplication tables. Some educators believe that this kind of mental calculation is the basis for higher mathematics learning. So it's not just a skill, it's a basic need for advanced learning. In addition to that, we emphasize students' imagination and creative thinking skills. For example in primary school education, the Shanghai government asks that each school provide one half day each week to offer all kinds of activities for the students to choose from. We want to let students have time to explore their own interests and to make their own choices in learning, and so we give them chances to do that. But it can be difficult to evaluate and assess creativity.    ""The emphasis on preschool education in China now is not whether the children can or cannot go to the kindergarten. It is more about what should we teach the children in kindergarten."" -- Zhu XiaohuIn the US, there has been more focus recently on making sure preschool programs are available to all children. What support is currently being offered by the Chinese government to support universal preschool?Zhu Xiaohu: If you want to send your child to preschool, it's easy! It's not so expensive because most of the kindergartens are public here. Xu Jinjie: Since 2010, Shanghai has set up another hundred preschools and is expanding the scale of public preschools to assess and educate more kids from migrant labor force families. So our government really has put the right policies in place.Zhu Xiaohu: Actually, the emphasis on preschool education in China now is not whether the children can or cannot go to the kindergarten. It is more about what should we teach the children in kindergarten. Several years ago, the preschool education was very similar to the primary school. In kindergarten, the children learned mathematics, Chinese and other academic subjects. But now we believe this is not good because the most important thing for preschool education is to allow students to develop good habits. Socialization versus academic knowledge should be the main emphasis. When my children went to preschool I recall there were mothers who would get annoyed if there were no worksheets and then there were mothers who would get annoyed if there were too many worksheets! And this was naturally an ongoing debate between the parents. ""As our economy develops, we believe many more students will study abroad in China. The trend is already shifting now. People want to learn Chinese as it also gives them better opportunities to do well in global business."" -- Zhu XiaohuLet's talk a little about higher education. There is a huge study abroad trend here in China with many students wanting to attend the US higher education institutions. I wonder why more students don't consider the higher education universities options in China? Zhu Xiaohu: Since the United States and Europe are developed countries, we need to learn and catch up with them. The Chinese have to know Western culture as it benefits our economy and our nation. So China must participate in that world, and we believe this is a good thing. But as our economy develops, we believe many more students will study abroad in China. The trend is already shifting now. People want to learn Chinese as it also gives them better opportunities to do well in global business. Xu Jinjie: Our Ministry of Education in Beijing has already started to pay attention to this issue. Last year our center was authorized to undertake a program for the MOE - Ministry of Education - as to how to integrate the credit of learning between different education solutions that have been identified. For example, if a student studies in America for one year and then studies in China for the second year, we are in the process of figuring out how to recognize the learning credit in Shanghai. The government is thinking about this too that is the recognition of cross-cultural learning credits which promote the internationalization of higher education. Also there are various schools setting up alliances between nations, for example NYU Shanghai, and these schools are changing the landscape of higher education. Yes, students are being raised as global thinkers and so they won't necessarily study in their own country for their entire academic career any longer. The value of those face-to-face experiences in other cultures is becoming ever more critical. Thank you both for your time. L to R: Zhu Xiaohu -- C.M. Rubin -- XU Jinjie(All photos are courtesy of C.

The government is thinking about this too that is the recognition of cross-cultural learning credits which promote the internationalization of higher education. Also there are various schools setting up alliances between nations, for example NYU Shanghai, and these schools are changing the landscape of higher education. Yes, students are being raised as global thinkers and so they won't necessarily study in their own country for their entire academic career any longer. The value of those face-to-face experiences in other cultures is becoming ever more critical. Thank you both for your time. L to R: Zhu Xiaohu -- C.M. Rubin -- XU Jinjie(All photos are courtesy of C.

This week I'm going to tell you how I failed my way to success in Brazil.,2015-05-21,2015-05-18-1431971576-5095749-businessinBrazil.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-18-1431971576-5095749-businessinBrazil-thumb.jpg,"My last piece was the beginning of a series on the difficulties inherent in starting up an international business. Building anything out of nothing is difficult, doing so on the international stage is just that much harder. In order to succeed in foreign countries a startup needs to know the language and the culture of the country they operate in or they're doomed to failure. This week I'm going to tell you how I failed my way to success in Brazil.Finding a Business PartnerAccording to the World Bank Group, Brazil ranks 120th in the world for ease of doing business and 167th for ease of starting a business. That puts it behind Uganda and just ahead of Ethiopia towards the bottom of the 189 nation list. Knowing this I went to Brazil to look for schools that we could partner with in order to cut through the red tape involved in ""going it alone."" We interviewed several schools in São Paulo including a university. All had their pros and cons, most unfortunately had more cons. Not knowing the language or culture proved to be a major problem. Despite most of the Brazilian business people being able to speak English, I had a difficult time working with them. I had flown all the way to Rio to meet with some of these schools and when I showed up, on time, for the meetings they were no where to be found or showed up 30 minutes late. When we did meet the conversation went in circles and there were no real direct answers. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/legalcodeTrusting the Dutch in BrazilI ultimately settled on a school run by a Dutchman. I felt that a European might be easier to partner with than a Brazilian. I hate to say it but it came down to trust. For some reason it was easier for me to trust a European than a Brazilian. Together we got to work, putting 6 months into building our own exclusive Brazilian Portuguese content. I took two trips to Brazil to meet with them. Then, just as we were getting ready to launch our Brazilian Portuguese program, the school went dark.Not practicing what I preach came back to hurt the business. I tried for months to get in touch with the school...crickets. I finally heard from a former teacher at the school. He informed me that my contact, the CEO of the company, had fled the country. I don't know what happened, or where he went, but I do know that it set our company back months and cost us a lot of money.Localizing BrazilIt was at that point that I interviewed and hired a brilliant Brazilian woman living in NYC to head the Portuguese program. She developed our entire Brazilian Portuguese curriculum from scratch. She began the search for schools and teachers in Brazil and was able to find candidates that seemed viable. Prior to leaving to pursue an advanced degree she helped me find a terrific new Regional MGR, Lidi Albuquerque. She warned us that we would run into some of the same problems that I had previously experienced.Lidi wrote about these Brazilian traits earlier this year. They're generalizations and certainly don't apply to everyone, but they did apply to our first hires in Brazil. One of the traits is that many Brazilians find it difficult to keep commitments. This was our downfall. Although the teachers seemed to be viable options, they were not. We would have students scheduled for lessons, the teacher would commit to the dates and times requested, the student would show up...teacher was at the beach. This happened far too many times when we were first getting started. It was detrimental not only to our reputation for Brazilian Portuguese, but was having a negative impact on our Chinese program as well.SuccessAfter a few bad hires things started coming together. We hired my original regional managers niece in Brazil, Georgia. She has been an amazing teacher and more for us. She and Lidi have been instrumental in finding teachers who are reliable, show up on time, and are talented. I'm convinced that the reason we were having difficulty before was simply that I was unable to ""read people"" during the interview process because of language and cultural barriers. I'm sure that I turned away several candidates who would have made great teachers, and hired people who were not. I've turned over the hiring process in Brazil entirely to Lidi and Georgia. They have formed a group of very reliable and talented teachers."

African countries on October 23 pledged to send more than 1,000 health workers to Ebola-ravaged Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, where the World Health Organization says the spread of the killer virus 'remains of great concern'. AFP PHOTO / CELLOU BINANI (Photo credit should read CELLOU BINANI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14cd32400005500e483c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Something African leaders have deftly avoided discussing in the wake of the Ebola outbreak is the impact their corrupt and incompetent governance has had on how they (mis)manage such crises. It is no surprise that countries in the ""hot zone"" of the disease -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- were demonstrably ill-prepared to deal with its occurrence or contain its progression.Ironically, the ""big men"" of the African Union (AU) took to blaming the organization's bogeyman and favorite whipping boy -- the West -- for failing to do enough to fight the global epidemic.To be perfectly clear, infectious diseases such as Ebola, MERs and SARs, in this era of jet-travel and the global village, are global crises that require cooperation among all nations. However, the saying ""charity begins at home"" comes to mind and effective crisis management requires good governance and adequate infrastructure -- at home. At a minimum, good governance and adequate infrastructure includes provision of hospitals, transportation to the hospitals (including roads), trained hospital personnel and administrators guided by the Hippocratic Oath, functioning equipment, timeliness and consistency of pay commensurate with the important role they play in society etc.Back in late October 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that Nigeria was ""Ebola-free."" Africa's most populous nation averted disaster because the two medical personnel -- Benjamin Ohiaeri and Ameyo Stella Adadevoh -- who were involved in the diagnosis and treatment of Patrick Sawyer, an American of Liberian descent insisted on keeping him isolated despite threats of legal action by Liberian officials demanding his release. Dr. Ohiaeri and Dr. Adadevoh adhered to the strict protocol of handling suspected cases of Ebola without succumbing to political pressure or the corruption Africa is notorious for.In a sequence of events rich in irony, Kenya, one of Africa's most corrupt countries, took note of the success of another corrupt African country -- Nigeria -- in how it handled the disease. The country's cabinet secretary of Health and former banker James Wainaina Macharia penned an article that catalogued the reasons for Nigeria's success in her fight against Ebola.On the cabinet secretary's list were: (a) early identification of the disease, (b) good governance, (c) lab facilities, (d) detective work, (e) awareness and some other basic factors that combined to enable Nigeria to stem spread of the disease.Mr. Macharia went on to write that ""Kenya Medical Research Institute's (KEMRI) laboratories are recognized as regional centers of diagnostic excellence."" While that may be true, Nigeria's handling of Mr. Sawyer's case underscored the importance of effective and efficient use of available diagnostic tools and the results (of the diagnosis) to respond accordingly. In a sharp contrast, the recent floods in Nairobi point to ineffective construction and maintenance of infrastructure. The African Union's incompetent handling of the continent's many human crisis also point to the body's ineffective diagnosis and mitigation of events that have too often morphed into full-blown crisis, the worst, in recent memories, being the genocide in Rwanda. The genocide in Rwanda, Darfur, Ebola, the many civil wars in Africa, the terrorism and flooding in Kenya are stark reminders of (African) leadership that is absolutely incompetent and not accountable to anyone!Kenya's Cabinet Secretary of Health points to Nigeria's ""generous"" allocation of money to deal with the (Ebola) situation as an example of ""good governance"". I will forgo the enticing analysis (and humor) that has ""Kenya,"" ""good governance"" and ""money"" in the same sentence. Instead, I will use the (mis)handling of the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S. (by officials at America's Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital) and resultant death of Liberian Thomas Duncan to illustrate what incompetent crisis management looks like!Mr. Duncan's case was poorly handled from the get-go. His medical condition was misdiagnosed and politicized. The foregoing resulted in dissemination of inaccurate information to an American public already predisposed to believing anything negative about Africa and Africans. There were also changing storylines and accusations of racism. Together, the comedy of error by officials in Texas and at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) threatened mass panic among jittery Americans as individuals who had come into contact with America's Patient Zero traveled across the country, potentially exposing others!Let's hope that the AU's current handling of the recent crisis in Burundi or Kenya's handling of the terrorist attacks is neither an indication of the organization's newly found Pan-Africanist chops nor affirmation of an ""Africa/n (country) Rising"". If it is, the crisis management abilities of the continent and of Kenya are eons away from ""rising""!"

If you cannot properly express your expertise in writing, no one will know how good you are at your job. And the fact is, whether it is fair or accurate or not, people tend to judge overall intelligence by writing ability. So if your website is full of typos, incorrect grammar, incorrect use of words, or other problems, your business as a whole will be judged as less competent and professional.Content writing is very time consuming. Writing content for the pages on your site, writing blogs about your business, and keeping your site up-to-date and current takes a lot of time and effort. You have a business to run, and having to do the writing yourself will take away time that could be spent actually providing the products and/or services that your business was built to provide.Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a business all its own. Professional content writers are trained to know how to write content so that it gets your site as close as possible to the top of the results list on the search engine page. This requires special knowledge about how search engines like Google evaluate Houston Web Design for listing purposes, what keywords and keyword phrases are most to lead people to what you do, and in general how to arrange the content for maximum results. And since the 'rules' for Search Engine Optimization change fairly frequently, the content often has to be changed and updated to accommodate. You know your business, but you likely do not have the time or energy to stay up on the changing rules of SEO and update your website to fit those rules.It is sometimes hard for people in the business to see things from their potential customers' eyes. The first rule in any type of writing is to know your audience. And while you may know that your business is exactly what your customers need, if you can't express that in a way that acknowledges where they are coming from, you may not can properly convince them.

She is the President and CEO of 5001 FLAVORS and Harlem Haberdashery. She is a pioneer in couture urban fashion. If Jacob the Jeweler is the first stop for hip hop artists to show their arrival, then 5001 FLAVORS is the shop for a custom wardrobe MTV red carpet worthy. I recently sat down with Sharene Wood to talk about how she balances marriage, motherhood, and a business enterprise working alongside her husband.Mr. Refined (MR): Several companies started in dorms and garages, like Microsoft and Facebook. You started 5001 FLAVORS in your dorm at Columbia University your junior year. When you were a young girl growing up in Harlem, did you think or know you would be in the fashion industry?Sharene ""Shay"" Wood (SW): I didn't realize that I was part of a trend. I grew up knowing that I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I just didn't know in what field. I grew up watching my father run his business on Lenox Avenue. I would assist writing checks and doing administrative support. I liked that. I liked the family aspect. It shows young kids what is possible. I liked fashion, classic items that made a statement. So when Guy (Wood) asked me to be his business partner while he was creative director, it seemed natural. We started 5001 FLAVORS with $600 using my Brother Word Processor, no computer.MR: Who are your female role models?SW: My mom, Esther Barnett, is my role model for a strong, independent, well-spoken and intelligent woman. She encouraged me to be inquisitive and nurturing. She told me that I was capable of all that I wanted to be. She instilled that message from the beginning. I never realized how important a mother was until I became one. I realized the power of my words could build up or break down my child. I never fully knew the gift and responsibility I was getting when I became a mother. My mother set such a wonderful example for me.MR: How do you balance being a mother and an entrepreneur?SW: I don't think you ever balance. It always feels like a compromise. You can't do it all. Don't strive for perfection. Strive for happiness. First, make time for yourself so that you can be there for your family. Second, prioritize your day. I make daily to-do lists to balance being a mom, daughter, sister and business owner.MR: Your daughter, Sydney Wood, is just six years old and in the store with you. You encourage her to join the family brand?SW: She is learning. She comes to work with me. It is important for her to be in the workplace to understand that it is not just dressing up going to events. It is work. She understands that it is a never ending job. But she sees it is also fun. She is a hard worker. At the end of each day, she asks about her pay. She recently informed me that she needed business cards.MR: You built a brand and empire with your husband, Guy Wood. How do you balance being a wife and business partner with your husband?SW: Guy and I started out dating and living together. Then we broke up and did not date for a long time, about 10 years. However, we were always friends first. At times it was hard while we were not dating, but we built a brand together. Neither of us wanted to jeopardize the brand. Guy is my partner in life and in business.MR: You will have been married eight years in May. What do you attribute to having a successful marriage?SW: A healthy family dynamic. Respecting business roles and responsibilities. You have to leave family issues at the door. Remember that you are working on building a legacy together. Again, he is my partner in life and business. MR: What advice do you have for young girls? SW: Believe in yourself. Sometimes you can't listen to the extra noise. Being self-sufficient does not mean that you have to do it all by yourself. It just means you know how, if you need to. Get an education to give yourself options. Be independent, so that you are not stuck in a situation. Love the world and it will love you back.MR: What do you want your legacy to be as a woman? SW: I want to leave a transferable legacy of wealth and business. I want to leave my family with more than I started with. It's all about the betterment of the family and a business legacy. I want to have made a difference and changed the world, making it a better place. I want it to be said that I created opportunities for people and helped educate others. I want to be remembered as making people happy and being happy with life. I want to know that I made someone feel needed and special."

Bush is fluent in the language, and often uses it in Florida, but it's rarely heard in Republican presidential campaign politics. (AP Photo/Ricardo Arduengo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fa7c3c000020010e033f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jeb Bush certainly had a bad week last week, as he struggled to come up with a clear answer to a question he really should have been expecting in the first place. Other Republicans also struggled to admit that the Iraq War was indeed a mistake (which is somewhat understandable, because by doing so they are criticizing a former Republican president). But while the spectacle of Republicans having to admit a big Republican mistake certainly is amusing, there's an even bigger question which so far has remained unasked: ""Knowing all the things we've learned in the past decade and a half, what would it take for you to send American troops to fight an overseas war?"" This is the real question the voters deserve an answer to. To put it more bluntly: ""How many more wars can we expect if you are elected?""The present situation should be taken as a starting point for this conversation. Already, some Republican candidates have openly called for more American ground troops to be sent back into Iraq to fight the Islamic State. It remains to be seen whether the other candidates will jump aboard this train of thought, in a frenzy of one-upmanship and chest-beating. But all those who criticize President Obama's handling of foreign policy -- which includes the entire Republican presidential field, it almost goes without saying -- should really have to detail precisely what they'd do differently. The voters really do deserve an answer to this question, since these people are running to take Obama's place in the White House.What should we do differently about fighting the Islamic State in Iraq? Should we fight alongside Iranian militias, or give them air cover? If American ground troops are the answer, then how many of them do you think should be sent, and how close to the front lines should they be? How many American troops will it take to push the Islamic State out of Iraq and stabilize the country? How long are they going to have to stay?The next questions are obvious: What about Syria? Should we be bombing Syria? On whom, exactly, should we drop these bombs? The government's forces? The Islamic State? Should American ground troops be sent in to Syria to pacify the situation? Who would they be fighting alongside? Who would they be fighting against? Would overthrowing Assad be part of their mission, or not?Marco Rubio recently introduced what might be called the ""Liam Neeson Doctrine,"" stating that Islamic terrorists should just be hunted down and killed, like in a Hollywood movie. He didn't qualify the sentiment at all. What he (and other Republican candidates) are really talking about is reviving the Bush/Cheney concept of the ""Global War On Terrorism"" (often shortened to ""GWOT""). We'll fight terrorists anywhere on Earth, to avoid having to fight them here at home (that's the theory, at any rate).So beyond the borders of Iraq and Syria, where else should we be taking this fight? How about Yemen? Should we throw our lot in with any of the three groups fighting for power there? How, exactly? Bombing runs? Boots on the ground?Or how about the failed state of Libya? The Islamic State has become active in Libya, so should we be fighting them there, too? We tried an air war with no ground troops before, and it did succeed in its main objective of overthrowing Qaddafi, but we sure didn't follow through with any nation-building afterwards. So, to really solve Libya, we'd have to not only defeat all the various Islamist militias, but also occupy and pacify the country -- a project which could take years. How many American troops should be committed to such a mission?There's a lot of Islamic terrorism happening in sub-Saharan Africa as well. Should America declare war on groups like Boko Haram? They're Islamic terrorists too, so wouldn't they be included in the whole GWOT grand plan? How many countries should American troops invade, realistically?Then there's an even bigger problem to contemplate. All the Republican candidates seem to disagree with President Obama's attempt at diplomacy with Iran, some stating they'd unilaterally pull out of any Obama-negotiated Iranian deal ""on Day One."" Each of these candidates should be asked to explain, in detail, exactly what it would take for them to go to war with Iran. ""War,"" in this case, includes ""bombing their nuclear facilities,"" which many Republicans seem to have an interest in doing. So, they should be asked: How do you think Iran will respond to such an act of war (hint: The answer is not ""They would not retaliate at all"")? If Iran tries to close the Strait of Hormuz, would we then launch a naval or ground war against them? How many American troops is that going to take?When you add all these up, it's clear that Republicans making good on bellicose campaign promises would be a costly thing for America. We're going to need a whole bunch of Liam Neesons, to put it another way.But, I really shouldn't be making snide jokes. Going to war is a serious thing. Sending in American pilots or ground troops is part of the job of being president -- the most serious part, in fact. All those currently running for this job should be asked what their criteria would be for committing American lives to a fight. Instead of ""gotcha"" questions over the Iraq War, these are the questions I'd really like answered.What would it take for any future president to conduct drone warfare? On which countries should we be dropping bombs from unmanned aircraft? Which countries should American pilots be flying bombing missions over? Into which countries should American ground troops be sent? These are all valid questions to ask about the situation as it stands right now, not as it stood back in 2003.There are no easy answers to these questions. There is great risk in almost all of these options. On a scale of U.S. involvement, every choice carries future problems. Arming a group of foreign fighters can backfire, as it did with the Taliban. Bombing from drones can actually create more jihadi fighters than it kills, as has happened in Pakistan. Using American air power without ground troops can succeed militarily but fail badly afterwards, as happened in Libya. Ground wars can be won by American troops, but also lead to failure in the aftermath, as happened in the first few years of the Iraq War. Occupying a country can be a long hard slog with no good outcome ever achieved, again as shown in Iraq.I'm not saying I have answers to any of the questions I've posed here. They're tough questions, I admit. But then, I'm not running for president. I'm not auditioning for the job of deciding what the answers to all these questions will be, if I'm elected.Republicans have pushed back on the, ""Knowing what we know now, would you have sent troops into Iraq back then?"" question, since it is not only hypothetical, it is actually an impossibility (absent a working time machine). Nobody making any decision can have knowledge of the future while making it. But there are plenty of other hypothetical questions that are entirely valid -- questions about what America should do now, or in the near future. None of these questions involves time travel. ""What would you do now?"" or ""What would you do if you became president?"" are both completely reasonable lines of questioning for any presidential candidate.America deserves to know, from each and every candidate (in both parties), what it would take for them to enter our country into a war -- either a war that is currently ongoing, or a future war with a new adversary. I'm waiting for the media to wake up and realize this, now that they've had their fun with Bush and his floundering answer on Iraq. More important than, ""Which past wars would you have started?"" is a much more critical question for our country's immediate future: ""How many more wars will America enter if you become president?""Chris Weigant blogs at: Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantBecome a fan of Chris on The Huffington Post"

Photo: Jenny Anderson Playwright Robert Askins, while writing Hand to God, presumably never expected his irreverently absurd comedy to land on Shubert Alley with multiple Tony Award nominations. There it is at the Booth, though, with a strong set of ardent admirers (including many reviewers). This type of success can change expectations for an unorthodox 30-something playwright from Texas. His next play, fairly or not, is sure to be looked at in a very different light -- or spotlight -- than what came before.That play is now here: Permission, which is being presented by the MCC Theater at the Lortel. (MCC also produced Hand to God at the Lortel, although it was developed and initially presented in an earlier version by the Ensemble Studio Theatre.) Like Hand to God, Permission is outrageous and profane; like its predecessor, it can be seen as a sledgehammer attack on religion featuring violence and sex, albeit without as much bloodshed. But there the similarities end. Hand to God is inspired; Permission, alas, is not.For his starting point, Askins has borrowed the real-life practice called Christian Domestic Discipline. (You can look it up on the Internet, as the characters in the play do, although you might just want to let it pass.) In effect--or at least as described by Askins in Permission -- it suggests that it is God's will that the husband beat the wife, constantly. Zach (Lucas Near --Verbrugghe), owner of a sporting goods chain, lives happily with his too-submissive lawyer-wife Michelle (Nicole Lowrance). When his professor friend Eric (Justin Bartha) has trouble with his stay-at-home-drinking-wine wife (Elizabeth Reaser), Zach convinces him to apply the rod. Or, rather, the hairbrush. This he does, and it all works out not so well.

Photo: Jenny Anderson Playwright Robert Askins, while writing Hand to God, presumably never expected his irreverently absurd comedy to land on Shubert Alley with multiple Tony Award nominations. There it is at the Booth, though, with a strong set of ardent admirers (including many reviewers). This type of success can change expectations for an unorthodox 30-something playwright from Texas. His next play, fairly or not, is sure to be looked at in a very different light -- or spotlight -- than what came before.That play is now here: Permission, which is being presented by the MCC Theater at the Lortel. (MCC also produced Hand to God at the Lortel, although it was developed and initially presented in an earlier version by the Ensemble Studio Theatre.) Like Hand to God, Permission is outrageous and profane; like its predecessor, it can be seen as a sledgehammer attack on religion featuring violence and sex, albeit without as much bloodshed. But there the similarities end. Hand to God is inspired; Permission, alas, is not.For his starting point, Askins has borrowed the real-life practice called Christian Domestic Discipline. (You can look it up on the Internet, as the characters in the play do, although you might just want to let it pass.) In effect--or at least as described by Askins in Permission -- it suggests that it is God's will that the husband beat the wife, constantly. Zach (Lucas Near --Verbrugghe), owner of a sporting goods chain, lives happily with his too-submissive lawyer-wife Michelle (Nicole Lowrance). When his professor friend Eric (Justin Bartha) has trouble with his stay-at-home-drinking-wine wife (Elizabeth Reaser), Zach convinces him to apply the rod. Or, rather, the hairbrush. This he does, and it all works out not so well. Eric takes to locking his wife in a closet all day, which magically improves her behavior until the suddenly-enlightened Michelle comes round and disrupts both marriages.

At least three people were holding handguns. One biker was seen running with blood on his face, hands and torso.The footage shows only one round being fired — by a biker on the patio who then ran inside.Authorities have said the shooting began during an apparent confrontation between two rival motorcycle gangs — the Bandidos and the Cossacks. Some bikers have complained that police acted too hastily in making arrests and scooped up riders who had nothing to do with the violence.Before the shooting begins, the inside of the restaurant appears to be mostly empty. Bikers and other patrons can be seen walking to the windows facing the parking lot where most of the shooting happened.When gunfire erupts at 12:24 p.m., most bikers, other patrons and staff immediately run away from the windows and into the restaurant's interior. At least three people can be seen holding handguns.One camera angle shows bikers running into the men's bathroom. When there's no space left in the bathroom, they dash toward the kitchen.Another camera angle, on the far side of the restaurant from the gunfire, shows patrons who are not wearing biker gear crawling behind tables toward the kitchen. At least three bikers appear to be gesturing for the patrons to crawl to safety.None of the nine video angles shows the parking lot.Only one angle, taken from inside a back office in the restaurant, had audio. At 12:24 p.m., a woman is heard screaming, ""Oh my God!"" That's followed by multiple cries of ""Get back!"" Two minutes later, three gunshots are heard. It's not clear who fired.Video shows police with assault rifles entering the front door at about the same time. As two officers enter, bikers can be seen lying on the floor with their hands spread.Before the shooting, at least 20 members of the Cossacks gang can be seen on the patio. Members of the Scimitars, Boozefighters and Leathernecks can also be seen on the tape. While no Bandidos are immediately visible, police and one member of that biker gang have said some of their members were at the event.The AP was shown the video by representatives of the Twin Peaks franchise, who have said the fighting began outside the restaurant, not inside as police have previously said. The franchise did not release the video publicly, citing the ongoing investigation.Waco police spokesman Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton said police have the video, but he had not seen it and would not discuss its contents.Authorities on Sunday swept up around 170 bikers who descended on the restaurant. Among those arrested was Theron Rhoten, who had just pulled into the parking lot on his vintage Harley chopper when the bullets started flying.Rhoten showed up at the Twin Peaks restaurant for a regional motorcycle club meeting. But, according to his wife, he soon found himself in the middle of a deadly shootout involving scores of other bikers.Katie Rhoten said her husband ran for cover and was later arrested, along with motorcycle-riding friends and other ""nonviolent, noncriminal people.""""He's good to his family,"" she said. ""He doesn't drink. He doesn't do drugs. He doesn't party. He's just got a passion for motorcycles.""Police have said that all those arrested were part of criminal motorcycle gangs, but only five of the nine people killed had criminal histories in Texas, based on court records and a search of their names in a database maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety.In addition, Manuel Isaac Rodriguez was arrested in 2010 and served probation for unlawfully carrying a weapon at a bar in Lewisville.Police have acknowledged firing on armed bikers, but it is not clear how many of the dead were shot by gang members and how many were shot by officers.Authorities have said the gathering of five biker groups was to resolve a dispute over turf. Some bikers dispute that, saying the meeting was organized to discuss laws protecting motorcycle riders and other subjects.Katie Rhoten said her husband, a mechanic from Austin, called her from jail and said that he and two other members of Vise Grip motorcycle club ducked and ran for cover as the violence raged around them.The arrested bikers have all been charged with engaging in organized crime and each is being held on $1 million bonds.The eight members of Theron Rhoten's group, the Vise Grip Club, specialize in building and riding vintage and antique motorcycles, particularly pre-1970 Harley Davidson big twin choppers, according to spokesman Brian Buscemi.Buscemi said the bimonthly meetings have been happening for 18 years.""Yes, there was a problem at this scene, and it was absolutely horrific,"" he said. ""But there just also happened to be a significant amount of people there who had nothing to do with it.""___Merchant and Warren reported from Dallas.___Associated Press National Writer Allen G.

16,POLITICS,California Farmers Agree To Give Up Some Of Their Water,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ca-drought-regulation-far_n_7348180.html,,2015-05-21,"In this photo taken Monday, May 18, 2015, Gino Celli inspects wheat nearing harvest on his farm near Stockton, Calif. Celli, who farms 1,500 acres of land and manages another 7,000 acres, has senior water rights and draws his irrigation water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Farmers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta who have California's oldest water rights are proposing to voluntarily cut their use by 25 percent to avoid the possibility of even harsher restrictions by the state later this summer as the record drought continues.(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fa801f00004002257ef7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A group of California farmers, in a surprising turnaround, is volunteering to give up a fourth of its available water this year, sharing a resource all but guaranteed to them for more than a century.A senior water official told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he would decide whether to accept the offer by Friday. The concession by farmers in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River delta could be one of the most important yet forced by California's record four-year drought.In exchange for taking 25 percent less river water for irrigation or leaving a quarter of their fields unplanted, the farmers want guarantees that the state won't restrict the remaining 75 percent of the water they've had rights to, even if the drought deepens and other users go dry.The offer was made as these and other ""senior water rights holders"" face an imminent threat of being included in the mandatory cutbacks that apply to most other California water users.Water officials said Wednesday they will start cuts overall among those senior rights holders Friday, ordering some senior rights holders along the San Joaquin River to cease all pumping from the river. It would mark the first cuts to the state's most senior water rights holders anywhere in the state since the 1970s, and the first in memory to senior rights holders along the San Joaquin. Water Resources Control Board Director Tom Howard told the AP that whatever he decides on the cutback offer from farmers will apply beyond the river delta to the entire basin of the Sacramento River, which supplies most of the surface water in the food-producing Central Valley and provides drinking water to homeowners across California.""Should we make an offer like that early, to give people clarity and regulatory certainty, or is there not enough water to really make a difference?"" Howard asked. ""We're just trying to make sure if the offer makes sense.""However, it is unclear whether the offer of voluntary water cuts from those with property along rivers and streams would be enough to protect waterways that are drying up around much of the state, following a winter of below-average rainfall and record-low snows in the Sierra Nevada.Delta water managers say it could become a model for farmers throughout California who are facing curtailments. It also could have an eventual impact on food prices, since California farmers use 80 percent of the water drawn from the land.State officials are focusing this round of cuts on holders of senior water rights, some dating to claims made during the Gold Rush era, long before industrialization in the 20th century led to climate change. The rights give nearly 4,000 landowners the strongest claims in California to this precious and increasingly limited resource.With California's drought showing no signs of easing, the state already has ordered mandatory 25 percent cutbacks in water use by cities and towns, and greatly curtailed water available to other farmers and others whose rights are less than a century old, and therefore less iron-clad.Gov. Jerry Brown has been criticized for sparing many farmers from the tightening regulations forcing cutbacks in communities throughout the state. This is the second straight year that thousands of ""junior water-rights holders,"" whose claims were staked after 1914, have been ordered to stop pumping river water for irrigation. The voluntary reduction farmers propose is reasonable because it matches what the governor has asked of all other Californians, said Jonas Minton, former deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources and now a private adviser on water policy.""Overall, if agriculture in California reduces its use by 25 percent, the state will weather this bad weather,"" Minton said. ""It's heartening to see that some agricultural water users are willing to do their share.""Legally, Delta farmers with the most senior water rights say the state can't stop them from irrigating their crops with river water, said John Herrick, manager of the South Delta Water Agency. He called their proposal a ""safe harbor"" for both sides, which he said would likely be adopted by other senior rights holders in the San Joaquin and Sacramento River watersheds.Michael George, the board's delta water master, said he personally believes the proposal ""is a reasonable trade-off.""""Nobody benefits if uncertainty persists,"" George said.California's 19th-century water laws still protect the earliest claims on rivers, such as the one that made gardens grow on sand dunes in San Francisco, whose mayor hiked into the Sierra in 1902 to nail a claim to an oak tree along the Tuolumne River.Minton said the system is long overdue for fundamental changes to accommodate a growing population vying for a shrinking amount of water. The drought also exposes California's need for better monitoring of water usage, but given the information available today, he said the proposal is as good as they come.---Terry Chea and Ellen Knickmeyer in San Francisco contributed to this report.

Glitz and glamor were part of the job and planning A-list events was my forte. In the days before social media, I had fashion stylists and couture event planners in my Rolodex. So, how would that transfer into my current role as doting mom planning my daughter's first birthday soiree? Today, I can barely find my iPhone, let alone have a rolodex, and I use Pinterest and Etsy at midnight while fueled up on wine and espresso. But, my love and dedication to extraordinary events is still part of who I am, whether I'm wearing a designer pencil skirt and stilettos or a lightly-ironed maxi dress paired with designer flip-flops. My competitive nature is also easily sparked. I mean, if these people on Pinterest can craft these magical masterpieces worthy of re-pins, I should be able to as well... right?1. Theme It. I was originally opting for an extremely girly baby party, however, my sister reminded me I may only have this year to pick the theme of her party. Realizing that next year, she may request a Doc McStuffin or Dora the Explorer party, I limited our options and my anxiety to Neverland and The Great Gatsby. My husband chose Neverland.2. Invitations. An invitation is the first glimpse your guest has of your event, so I was aiming at perfection. I also noticed a trend in first birthday invitations was to include a snapshot of your tiny tot. I found an online company, KC Creative Design Studio, that had a great design with option of adding a photo. I woke up the next morning thrilled that we had some simple components to make a quick Tinker Bell costume for the birthday belle to wear. Voilà -- invitations complete. 3. Entertain Me. A friend mentioned that she would never host a child-focused party without a bounce house, so I secured a Tinker Bell bounce house. I was also hoping to have some characters in attendance, like Tink and Peter. I immediately realized I had nobody who owed me a ridiculous favor, nor anyone to bribe. I also live in the Phoenix area, so we don't yet have all of the cool and convenient party options like I would have had when I lived in LA or Chicago. I was relieved to find Arizona had a company called Fairytale Events which specializes in sending princess people and characters to your party. They also offered things like face painting, playing party games, reading -- whatever you may want. To accompany the fairy characters, we ordered adorable fairy wings and headbands for the girls and pirate paraphernalia for the boys to channel their inner Captain Hook.4. Ambiance. For about two months, I was on Pinterest multiple times per day. I was committed to pinning and replicating. I also met with a local florist, found a balloon company that delivered and found a few Neverland games. 5. Eat, Drink and Be Merry. My husband is a total foodie, so it was a challenge maintaining a fairly simple menu. We opted for a few salads focusing on fresh seasonal vegetables and fruit along with grilled chicken, burgers and black bean burgers. I also have a slight obsession with extravagant desserts, so perfectly designing the cake was essential, with an emphasis on the ""smash cake."" We had a personal dessert chef work her magic, which turned out to be pretty unbelievable. Drinks were simple: Tinker Bell mini fruit punch, mini bottles of Martinelli's apple juice and bottled water for the kiddos with beer, wine and a spring spiked lemonade for the adults. 6. My Tips Planning in advance was key. Also, know your budget. Champagne dreams on a beer budget is doable if you plan efficiently, but be forewarned that children's events can quickly rack up a tab similar to a small wedding. I was also lucky to have a helpful husband plus two grandmas and one aunt in town to assist. Last but not least, remember... a 1-year-old will have absolutely no memory of their first birthday party. This is more for you."

Exotic cultures, delicious foreign food, a different language and a new perspective on life are just a few of the adventures that you could enjoy by packing up and getting out of Dodge. InterNations, the largest network for people who live and work abroad, has compiled a list of 10 of the best countries to move to for the romantics, globetrotters and the career-minded among us. So, what are you waiting for?Mexico  Nine in ten people who move to Mexico are pleased with their new home - the highest rating of all countries worldwide. Moreover, the Latin American country also takes the lead when it comes to the general friendliness of the local population.  Philippines  The world's happiest globetrotters can be found in the Philippines. This country is also home to the most harmonic couples: 56 percent are completely satisfied with their relationship. The global average is barely 40 percent; so moving to the Philippines might be just the thing to do before starting a family.  New Zealand  Your life lacks friendly conversation and peaceful moments? Moving to the isolated island nation of New Zealand would surely do you good: The local population is considered one of the most welcoming across the globe. Unsurprisingly, more than three in four people find it easy to settle down in New Zealand.  Australia  You aren't happy with your daily routine? Forget your nine-to-five job and go to Australia: 'Down Under' offers some of the best leisure options in the world, whether it's Sydney's bar scene or skydiving in Melbourne. Living in Australia is not just a lot of fun, but will greatly improve your quality of life as well: The country ranks second in the list of the healthiest and safest places worldwide.  Costa Rica  Costa Rica is the place to go to if you love socializing and meeting new friends. One of the best global rankings in terms of work-life balance gives you enough leisure time to enjoy the ease of finding new friends among the friendly local residents over a cocktail made from the country's official liquor, 'Guaro'.  Colombia  For those ready for a real change of scenery, Colombia might be an unusual, but fitting destination. Foreigners living in the country have the highest number of local friends worldwide and are also among the happiest travelers overall.  Germany  Life in Germany seems to be a life without sorrows: Nearly 100 percent of foreigners living there do not worry about their personal safety and the country offers one of the best job security ratings all over the globe. Furthermore, eight in ten people think the quality of medical care in Germany is good or excellent - on a global scale, only 50 percent rate their destination the same way.  Denmark  Everyone knows that the Nordic countries are very family-friendly. But popular Sweden is not on top of the list - actually, it's Denmark which ranks first in family well-being. The costs for childcare and education are considered very affordable, and last but not least, Denmark is one of the top countries when it comes to work-life balance.  Kazakhstan  A great destination for boosting your career and making a financial profit in the bargain: Kazakhstan is one of the leading countries where companies provide housing for employees sent abroad. Additionally, three in four foreigners in Kazakhstan are satisfied with their financial situation - a lot more than the global average of 45 percent.  Hungary  You have a high salary, but need to spend most of it on general expenses and groceries? Consider moving to Hungary instead, where you get a lot of value for money: Housing options for foreign residents are among the cheapest worldwide, and the country has an excellent travel and transport system to boot.

It was two years ago, my first trip. I'd only just arrived and it was nearly dusk. After dropping off my bag in the bedroom of the old fisherman's house I was staying in, I walked outside and sat in a wooden chair on the edge of the town square, called the Quadrado, a five-acre grass field that has been the heart of the village for more than five centuries. Some 50 former fisherman's houses line two sides of the Quadrado. The one I was staying in was painted a vibrant blue, and there were thick vines of red bougainvillea climbing up to its ceramic-tiled roof. To my right, near a cliff overlooking the sea, was a nearly 500-year-old whitewashed church, one of the oldest houses of worship in all of Brazil. In front of it, a dozen or so teenagers played soccer barefoot, an impromptu game full of laughter and shouts and good-natured arguments. Several horses grazed languidly nearby.On the other side of the Quadrado, directly across from where I sat, a woman braided what I assumed to be her young granddaughter's hair. Outside another house, one of several that have been converted into restaurants, waiters prepared tables for the evening meal, illuminated by a handful of small yellow lights that hung from an old tamarind tree. There was bossa nova music coming from another restaurant farther down. A young man sang, accompanied by a lone guitar. Sitting there, just watching and listening: that's when I fell in love with Trancoso, and when the idea of finding a home there began. I felt so completely unplugged, disconnected from the reality of my own life. I had no desire to check my phone or e-mail, no thoughts of being anywhere else. All I wanted was to sit there in dusk's dwindling light, watching this simple, stunning place quietly hum with life. Magical is the word people most often use to describe Trancoso. I understand why, but that word always makes me wince. I don't quite trust it. The first time I visited Brazil in 2001, a friend in Rio kept telling me how magical Trancoso was. ""You can feel the heartbeat of the earth on the Quadrado,"" he said. That stopped me from visiting for more than 10 years. It wasn't just my inherent skepticism. There were so many other places in Brazil I wanted to explore: Rio, São Paulo, Salvador, Manaus, the Amazon. The only reason I wound up in Trancoso is that my friend Andy Cohen, whom I would be traveling with along with my partner, Benjamin, and our friend Pablo, wanted to go somewhere quiet with a beach. As you may have guessed from my paleness, a beach is rarely high on my list of destinations. I also get bored quickly, and though I love the ocean, I can only stand so much sand and sun.More from T+L: These are the Friendliest Cities in AmericaTrancoso is not the easiest place to get to--a 13-hour trip from New York including a several-hour layover in Rio or São Paulo. There wasn't even a paved highway there until 2000, which is probably one of the reasons it's been able to resist many of the pitfalls of development. That and the fact that hippies arrived before developers and met a local population who were very connected to their traditions. Together they instituted stringent environmental laws that restrict how new structures can be built on the Quadrado.When we first reached Trancoso, it seemed like a mistake. We turned off the highway from Porto Seguro, the nearest airport, and entered the newer part of town, which is not much different from many other small urban centers in Brazil. Andy became suddenly very quiet as we passed block after block of cement storefronts selling electronics and motorbikes. I worried I'd made a huge mistake dragging my friends here--that is, until we got to the entrance of Uxua Casa Hotel, where I had made reservations.More from T+L: How to Enjoy Europe with the Kids (Really!)Uxua was opened in 2009 by Wilbert Das, the former creative director of Diesel. It is made up of a dozen beautifully proportioned private casas, some new, some colonial fisherman's houses that Wilbert restored using reclaimed wood, Brazilian antiques, and work by local artisans.The beach is a few minutes' walk downhill from the Quadrado, and the last hundred yards or so you cross a wooden footbridge that goes through a thick growth of mangroves. As you walk down the sun-bleached planks, red crabs scuttle for cover underneath. Trancoso's beaches, like many in the state of Bahia, are remarkably undeveloped. The forest meets the sand, and there are long stretches where you don't see a soul. A few small hotels are hidden here and there, almost impossible to see from the shore. There are no large resorts, no cruise ships docking. The ocean is warm and blue. Even at night I've walked down to the beach and plunged headfirst into the waves.More from T+L: The Best Places to Travel in 2015For several weeks around December and January, wealthy and stylish Brazilians flock to Trancoso. It's not my favorite time of year to be in town, but it does add a dose of glamour and energy that is a stark contrast to the rest of the year. If you are looking for St. Bart's, you won't find it here. St. Bart's is undeniably beautiful, but there's too much money, too many boldfaced names, too many people wanting to be invited to someone's party. It's hard to find the real life of the place. But in Trancoso real life is all around you. You hear occasional squabbles in the homes of families you are staying near, you hear celebrations, kids laughing and crying. Easter weekend you can join a congregation from the church as they walk the stations of the cross, or stand in a circle of capoeira fighters as they practice accompanied by drums and songs. I'm told someone once tried to open a nightclub on the Quadrado, with bouncers and a velvet rope. It closed after a few weeks. It's just not that kind of place. I have no illusions about Brazil, about the harsh reality of life for many of its citizens, or the potential for development to destroy all the things that generations of residents in Trancoso have tried to preserve. The problems that Brazil faces are many: economic uncertainty, lack of investment in infrastructure, widespread poverty. In Rio, I've had run-ins with corrupt cops who pulled me over and wanted a bribe. When I refused, I ended up being strip-searched in a police station. None of that has stopped me from falling in love with this place.More from T+L: Best Walking Shoes for Travel I went back a few months after my first visit, and Wilbert began to show me the few properties for sale on the Quadrado. They hardly ever come available. A couple of months later, one of the last unbuilt parcels on the Quadrado went on the market--a long plot of land with enormous trees that I would have to construct several bungalows around. The last thing I wanted to do was get involved in a construction project, and I knew it was impractical to build a house there. I don't speak Portuguese, not yet anyway, and I hardly ever take time off from work. But after Wilbert agreed to design the house and oversee construction using the same talented craftsmen who had helped him build Uxua, I decided to go ahead. The simple reason is that after traveling to some 70 countries over the past 23 years, I haven't found any place to match Trancoso. And I didn't like the idea of someone else's buying one of the few pieces of empty land left on the Quadrado and building something that didn't fit with the place and its people.There is much I have to learn about Trancoso, and I don't pretend to speak for the people there, but I'm excited that soon I will be a caretaker of a small part of it. I will probably rent out the house for much of the year, and I hope the people who come are the kind of visitors who will appreciate the character of this place. I hope they will fall in love with Trancoso as it is and as it wishes to remain.More from T+L: 5 Beauty Tips Every Traveler Should KnowI know it doesn't make sense to build this house, but not everything has to make sense. Sometimes when I'm far away in the world, working on assignment, surrounded by conflict and chaos, I close my eyes and if I pay attention to the rise and fall of my breath, the beat of my heart, I begin to hear the sounds of Trancoso: quiet, distant music drifting across the Quadrado on a warm summer night.--By Anderson Cooper"

All I wanted was to sit there in dusk's dwindling light, watching this simple, stunning place quietly hum with life. Magical is the word people most often use to describe Trancoso. I understand why, but that word always makes me wince. I don't quite trust it. The first time I visited Brazil in 2001, a friend in Rio kept telling me how magical Trancoso was. ""You can feel the heartbeat of the earth on the Quadrado,"" he said. That stopped me from visiting for more than 10 years. It wasn't just my inherent skepticism. There were so many other places in Brazil I wanted to explore: Rio, São Paulo, Salvador, Manaus, the Amazon. The only reason I wound up in Trancoso is that my friend Andy Cohen, whom I would be traveling with along with my partner, Benjamin, and our friend Pablo, wanted to go somewhere quiet with a beach. As you may have guessed from my paleness, a beach is rarely high on my list of destinations. I also get bored quickly, and though I love the ocean, I can only stand so much sand and sun.More from T+L: These are the Friendliest Cities in AmericaTrancoso is not the easiest place to get to--a 13-hour trip from New York including a several-hour layover in Rio or São Paulo. There wasn't even a paved highway there until 2000, which is probably one of the reasons it's been able to resist many of the pitfalls of development. That and the fact that hippies arrived before developers and met a local population who were very connected to their traditions. Together they instituted stringent environmental laws that restrict how new structures can be built on the Quadrado.When we first reached Trancoso, it seemed like a mistake. We turned off the highway from Porto Seguro, the nearest airport, and entered the newer part of town, which is not much different from many other small urban centers in Brazil. Andy became suddenly very quiet as we passed block after block of cement storefronts selling electronics and motorbikes. I worried I'd made a huge mistake dragging my friends here--that is, until we got to the entrance of Uxua Casa Hotel, where I had made reservations.More from T+L: How to Enjoy Europe with the Kids (Really!)Uxua was opened in 2009 by Wilbert Das, the former creative director of Diesel. It is made up of a dozen beautifully proportioned private casas, some new, some colonial fisherman's houses that Wilbert restored using reclaimed wood, Brazilian antiques, and work by local artisans.The beach is a few minutes' walk downhill from the Quadrado, and the last hundred yards or so you cross a wooden footbridge that goes through a thick growth of mangroves. As you walk down the sun-bleached planks, red crabs scuttle for cover underneath. Trancoso's beaches, like many in the state of Bahia, are remarkably undeveloped. The forest meets the sand, and there are long stretches where you don't see a soul. A few small hotels are hidden here and there, almost impossible to see from the shore. There are no large resorts, no cruise ships docking. The ocean is warm and blue. Even at night I've walked down to the beach and plunged headfirst into the waves.More from T+L: The Best Places to Travel in 2015For several weeks around December and January, wealthy and stylish Brazilians flock to Trancoso. It's not my favorite time of year to be in town, but it does add a dose of glamour and energy that is a stark contrast to the rest of the year. If you are looking for St. Bart's, you won't find it here. St. Bart's is undeniably beautiful, but there's too much money, too many boldfaced names, too many people wanting to be invited to someone's party. It's hard to find the real life of the place. But in Trancoso real life is all around you. You hear occasional squabbles in the homes of families you are staying near, you hear celebrations, kids laughing and crying. Easter weekend you can join a congregation from the church as they walk the stations of the cross, or stand in a circle of capoeira fighters as they practice accompanied by drums and songs. I'm told someone once tried to open a nightclub on the Quadrado, with bouncers and a velvet rope. It closed after a few weeks. It's just not that kind of place. I have no illusions about Brazil, about the harsh reality of life for many of its citizens, or the potential for development to destroy all the things that generations of residents in Trancoso have tried to preserve. The problems that Brazil faces are many: economic uncertainty, lack of investment in infrastructure, widespread poverty. In Rio, I've had run-ins with corrupt cops who pulled me over and wanted a bribe. When I refused, I ended up being strip-searched in a police station. None of that has stopped me from falling in love with this place.More from T+L: Best Walking Shoes for Travel I went back a few months after my first visit, and Wilbert began to show me the few properties for sale on the Quadrado. They hardly ever come available. A couple of months later, one of the last unbuilt parcels on the Quadrado went on the market--a long plot of land with enormous trees that I would have to construct several bungalows around. The last thing I wanted to do was get involved in a construction project, and I knew it was impractical to build a house there. I don't speak Portuguese, not yet anyway, and I hardly ever take time off from work. But after Wilbert agreed to design the house and oversee construction using the same talented craftsmen who had helped him build Uxua, I decided to go ahead. The simple reason is that after traveling to some 70 countries over the past 23 years, I haven't found any place to match Trancoso. And I didn't like the idea of someone else's buying one of the few pieces of empty land left on the Quadrado and building something that didn't fit with the place and its people.There is much I have to learn about Trancoso, and I don't pretend to speak for the people there, but I'm excited that soon I will be a caretaker of a small part of it. I will probably rent out the house for much of the year, and I hope the people who come are the kind of visitors who will appreciate the character of this place. I hope they will fall in love with Trancoso as it is and as it wishes to remain.More from T+L: 5 Beauty Tips Every Traveler Should KnowI know it doesn't make sense to build this house, but not everything has to make sense. Sometimes when I'm far away in the world, working on assignment, surrounded by conflict and chaos, I close my eyes and if I pay attention to the rise and fall of my breath, the beat of my heart, I begin to hear the sounds of Trancoso: quiet, distant music drifting across the Quadrado on a warm summer night.--By Anderson Cooper"

Then he leaned in close to the small tape player in his home -- the one whose radio he hadn't had the heart to disable. He turned it on and began to listen. “I switched the dial from one station to another, commercials for medical malpractice attorneys, car dealerships and department store blowout sales filling me with forbidden pleasure,” Deen wrote in his recently released memoir, All Who Go Do Not Return. “I was like a visitor from a different era encountering our modern one, captivated by its very mundaneness.”Indeed, leaving his home -- and Hasidism -- might as well have been time travel. Deen was born into an ultra-Orthodox Jewish family in Brooklyn, and lived from adolescence in New Square, New York. The Rockland County hamlet is made up entirely of Hasidim from the Skver sect, which originated in Skvyra, Ukraine. The society Deen inhabited for much of his adult life is deeply isolated from the modern world: The Skverer Hasidim, like most ultra-Orthodox Jews, eschew the Internet, television and non-Jewish music, and adhere to strict limitations on diet and dress. For Hasidim, life orbits around service to God. In communities scattered throughout the northeastern U.S., hundreds of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews have created insular, inward-facing worlds, islands of radical piety in the midst of America’s bustling secular life. Hasidic men lead their lives immersed in the Talmud, one of Judaism’s holiest texts. Yiddish, not English, is the language spoken on the streets. And everything, from birth to marriage to death, is supervised by tight-knit communities committed to enforcing pious norms for themselves and their neighbors. People are born, live, and die within the confines of family and faith. No one leaves.Except the ones who do. For people who exit Hasidic communities, it can mean total rupture: Leaving Hasidism means leaving behind family, community and the only way of life they have ever known, in favor of a secular world whose realities they are ill-prepared for. These individuals call themselves OTD, or “off the derech,” the Hebrew word for “path.” The new roads they take are often fraught with difficulty. But OTD individuals have begun to find one another -- sharing the challenges, and triumphs, of the journey out.After leaving Hasidism, Deen endured a divorce, struggled to find a job and became estranged from his five children. He found himself deeply depressed in his newfound isolation.“I was cut off completely from my previous community, and I had no connections in the outside world,” he told The Huffington Post. “I had no friends who were not religious.”That’s when Deen reached out to Footsteps, an organization that works to support individuals making the transition out of the ultra-Orthodox world.Founded in 2004 by a formerly Hasidic woman, Footsteps has aided 1,000 people to date, according to Lani Santo, the current director. The organization offers a number of programs ranging from educational services to peer support groups. ""Footsteps provides absolutely crucial services -- sometimes lifesaving services,"" said Deen. ""Without Footsteps -- I’ve had some serious episodes of depression –- without Footsteps I don’t know if I would be alive now. It was really that crucial. It was lifesaving to me, and I know it was lifesaving to many others.""The educational services that Footsteps offers teach skills most of us take for granted: talking to someone of the opposite gender; reading a restaurant menu; writing a resume.Men leaving the Hasidic community have an extra hurdle to clear: Hasidic boys’ schools often sidestep state educational requirements, eschewing subjects like science and math to immerse students in a rigorous curriculum of Talmud study. Many adult male Hasidim read English at only a fourth- or fifth-grade level, Santo told HuffPost. “They need a GED en route to college if that’s what they want,” she explained, adding that finding employment in the Hasidic world is facilitated by a vibrant, informal network within the religious community. ""The risks are great, and the courage it takes [to leave] is pretty astounding.” Women face a different, if no less profound, set of challenges. Deen calls the Hasidic world a “deeply chauvinistic” society -- one in which women are categorically barred from community leadership roles and their lives shaped by stringent conceptions of modesty. But because girls are prevented from studying the Talmud, secular education is more widespread in girls’ schools. “Girls, because what they do with their time is considered less important, there’s more laxity about what they read,” Leah Vincent, a board member of Footsteps who left the ultra-Orthodox world in her teens, told HuffPost.But despite comparatively better access to education, women who leave the Hasidic world can find themselves deeply vulnerable due to the sex segregation and rigidly enforced gender roles they've encountered from an early age.In her haunting memoir, Cut Me Loose: Sin and Salvation After My Ultra-Orthodox Girlhood, Vincent wrote about how her sheltered upbringing left her ill-prepared to break with her faith. In her late teens, during her first intimate relationship with a man, she found herself unable to refuse his advances -- and ultimately experienced a traumatic rape. ""No one should have to pay the price for freedom that I had to pay,"" Vincent said. “I had to recognize that I had a right to my own opinion, that my entire self didn’t have to make the man in front of me feel good. My mom defined herself as an enabler -- she enabled my father to study. Women enable men and children. That was part of my identity. That’s something I’m still working on.” For Vincent and many others who have made the perilous transition out of the Hasidic world, Footsteps is a crucial resource -- not just for its career resources and legal aid, but for the community it provides. Vincent said that through her involvement with the organization, she hopes to prevent others from enduring what she did.""I only found out about Footsteps after the worst of my journey -- the story I tell in my memoir -- happened, but there I found and connected with people with similar experiences,"" Vincent said. ""I realized I wasn’t alone; other people had faced these issues.""Melissa Weisz, an actress in her late 20s who left the Satmar Hasidic community soon after her marriage at 19, told HuffPost that Footsteps helped her build a brand-new life -- from her identity to her wardrobe. When she left her old life, Weisz said, “I was putting myself through school, working overnight at group homes. I was going to do anything I had to do to make sure I was going to live.”""I looked to Footsteps because I felt like an outsider,” she continued. “I remember looking at myself in the mirror -- I saw myself in jeans, but on the inside I felt the mirror was lying to me. I was convinced that everyone could see that I was supposed to be in a skirt, everyone could see through me."" And the cohort of those who seek support at Footsteps is growing.“We’ve entered a network of at least 3,000 or 4,000 people,” Santo said. “New members have increased each year significantly. In 2010, the number of new-member intake interviews was 46. Last year, in 2014, it was 142 -- a 150 percent increase.”The ultra-Orthodox population itself is growing by leaps and bounds, in large part due to a community culture that encourages having as many children as possible. According to the Pew Research Center, Orthodox family size is nearly double that of the national average. Recently, Santos said, Footsteps affiliates organized a Mother’s Day barbecue in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. Many attendees’ mothers were no longer speaking to them. Others were mothers themselves, locked in custody battles for children they might never be able to speak to again. But thanks to Footsteps, Facebook groups and other websites, those who have left the ultra-Orthodox world are starting to find each other -- and face their struggles together. On a path that diverges from the unbending arc of life prescribed by tradition, they've begun recognizing each other on the road. And freedom itself is its own kind of revelation, says Weisz. She recounted a shining moment from her early twenties: going to the beach. “It was so freeing that I got to feel the water on my skin. We had that in pools growing up, but we had to be totally covered up,” she said. “It was the first time that I was actually in the open -- immersed. It felt like I was part of the world, that I was free.”"

As I explained on my Facebook page, I started to write a blog post that Sunday morning, but then I realized that the Mother's Day post I wrote in 2014 still applied. So I saved myself some keystrokes.But after the day was over, I felt like I needed to document it in some way. I also started having some thoughts about Father's Day, which is right around the corner. And this is the result: A post-Mother's Day/pre-Father's Day post from my crazy mind.Mother's Day was spectacular in every way. It started off with me making my amazing wife an omelette for breakfast, and ended with me cooking burgers and brisket for my amazing wife, two sons, all but one of my siblings and my amazing mom. The day was perfect. To have all of those people who are so special to me at the dining room table at the same time just felt so good.It really was the best Mother's Day celebration -- as low-key as it was -- that I can remember. My wife and mom were both so happy. And they deserved to be happy, because they are both such loving, caring, unselfish people. Without a doubt, they are the two most incredible women I have ever known.A few days after Mother's Day passed, I started thinking a bit about Father's Day, which is coming up on June 21st. (The longest day of the year. Coincidence? I think not.)Father's Day has always been an uncomfortable holiday for me. For most of my life, I struggled with it so much because my dad and I didn't have a very good relationship. In fact, for many years, the only relationship we had was the standard biological one. Yes, he was my father. But I never felt the things that a kid should feel about his father: love, respect, gratitude, etc.That's what happens when your dad's an alcoholic.I remember countless Father's Days when I wouldn't even want to pick up the phone to call my dad, because saying ""Happy Father's Day"" to him was just me going through the motions. I got through those calls somehow, but it was not without a lot of anguish.Then, in February of 2012, my dad passed away, just a few months after he and I reconciled.As I wrote in my Father's Day post in 2013:It's funny how things work out. I went 40+ years despising Father's Day because I didn't want to make that phony phone call or give the obligatory card and gift because I felt like I had to. Today, I wish I could make that phone call and give that card and gift... because I want to. This Father's Day will no doubt be the same. I'll be missing my dad and wishing I had just one more Father's Day to spend with him so I could give him a hug and tell him I love him -- and actually mean it.Father's Day is also a stressor for me because I constantly struggle with a question I ask myself almost every single day: Have I been a good father to my boys?Because of the relationship I had -- or didn't have -- with my dad while I was growing up, I would constantly tell myself that the one thing I was bound and determined to do in my lifetime, more than anything else, was to be a better father to my kids than my father was to me. Not just a better father, but a damn good father. Someone my kids would look up to and aspire to be like.Given the fact that my father was an alcoholic/workaholic who put his whiskey and business ahead of everything else in his life, you'd think that meeting that goal I set for myself would be a slam dunk. I mean, how could I not be a better father? I should be able to do that blindfolded, with both hands tied behind my back. And how hard could it be to be a damn good father? Love your kids, say and do the right things, set good examples, teach your boys to be good men, etc. It all sounds so simple.But you know what? It's not. And I'm not sure I've succeeded.This really hit me hard over the last 36 hours or so. Yesterday, I had an email conversation with a younger friend -- and by younger, I mean I'm old enough to be her father -- and she said something that should have been very flattering to me. She said: ""You are so awesome. Seriously. You're like the dad I always wanted!!!""Wow. What a great compliment, right?Except that the night before, something happened between me and my younger son that made me feel like I was anything but a good father, let alone the type of dad someone would actually want.Over the years, my family has gone through some difficult situations, and we've all said and done things that we didn't really mean or ended up regretting. In life, when we're angry, we sometimes do some inexplicable things. But when I replay certain events in my mind, I feel like I've done way more than my fair share of these things. I've said things -- hurtful things -- to my boys in anger that I could never have imagined saying. Things that my dad, as shitty as he was for so many years, never said to me.So, I have to ask myself whether or not I am a good father.Yes, my boys regularly tell me that they love me. And, over the years, both of them have also told me, on more than one occasion, that they hate me. (That's what teenagers do, right? RIGHT???!) But I often wonder how they really feel, deep down inside. I guess I think this way because I know that I put up a facade with my dad for all those years. I said one thing, but I felt another. It was just the easiest thing to do.Nobody ever knows exactly how another person feels. That superpower does not exist. At least not on this planet. People tell us things and we have to take them at their word, because that's all we have to go by. If you spend your time second-guessing what someone says, you'll drive yourself crazy; which is exactly what I've been doing to myself lately.Someone I work with in my addiction/recovery advocacy work said something during a conference call a few months ago that I thought was brilliant. It was said in the context of parents dealing with an addicted child, but I think it applies to pretty much every aspect of life: ""You do the best that you can with what you know at the time. You learn as you go along, and you try to do better. And you can never go wrong with love.""That's some pretty great stuff, isn't it?As parents, I think we're constantly learning. After all, parenting is one of the most challenging things in life. So I will continue to learn as I go along, and I will most definitely try to do better. Because no matter how good you are -- or think you are -- there's always room for improvement.Most importantly, though, I will continue to throw an abundance of love in my boys' direction. Because I love them more than life itself.When Father's Day arrives, I will no doubt sit and ponder about all this stuff yet again.

Plungers long ago gave way to workers wielding pitchforks in the battle against sewers filled with giant, clinging balls of waste known as used wet wipes. And we are paying the price.So-called ""flushable"" wipes are clogging plumbing pipes, septic tanks, and sewers in all parts of the world. Using keywords ""wet wipes sewer"", take a journey through any search engine's photo library and see a litany of appalling photos. Pounds upon pounds of these seemingly innocent products are causing plumbing and sewer nightmares and adversely affecting taxpayers and the environment. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has begun to mitigate the burgeoning problem by requiring a wet wipes manufacturer to substantiate claims that its products are, in fact, flushable. That is a difficult task, since sewers have already proven that those wipes do not degrade quickly enough, if ever, to be environmentally or plumbing-system friendly.A complaint was filed by the FTC against Nice-Pak Products, Inc., accusing Nice-Pak of misrepresentation with regards to ""flushable"" claims. A settlement was reached. Via the terms of the settlement, Nice-Pak will not claim that its moistened toilet tissue products are safe for sewer and septic tanks, nor will it provide its trade customers, like Target, Costco, CVS, and BJ's Wholesale Club with marketing information that perpetuates unsubstantiated ""flushable"" claims.Further, Nice-Pak is prohibited from making misleading representations regarding ""benefits, performance, or efficacy of moist toilet tissue"", unless there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to support such claims. Jessica Rich, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection stated: ""The evidence didn't back up Nice-Pak's claims that their wipes were safe to flush. If you claim a product is flushable, it needs to flush in the real world, without clogging household plumbing or sewer and septic systems.""The FTC agreement will be subject to public hearing for 30 days, beginning May 19, 2015. Electronic comments are welcomed, and consumers can voice opinions on this specific issue at FTC's public comment site. Or just scroll through the public comment section on the FTC website until you find Proposed Consent Agreement: In the Matter of Nice-Pak Products, Inc.Tackling harmful and misleading claims is not a job for the FTC alone. As consumers, it is also our job. When products don't live up to their advertised claims, or don't perform as expected, we benefit from sharing that discovery. Online complaints about products can be filed on the FTC website, or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) for assistance. The FTC is only at its best when the consumers it seeks to protect take an active role in helping to identify problem products and services. It does take a village to do a lot of things well, and monitoring the millions of products on the market is an enormous task that benefits from having millions of eyes and ears tuned in to product issues.Perhaps if manufacturers of ""flushable"" wipes had to pick up a pitchfork and spend a little time in the sewer skewering the mangled, tangled mass that is their products' final form, they would quickly revise their claims. Meanwhile, we can take proactive steps to stop the problem that costs us dearly. We can simply stop flushing wet wipes of any kind. It's one thing to flush them when we are unaware that there is an unforgivable consequence of doing so, It's another thing to flush them once we know the truth. And now we know the truth.  Fortunately, there's really no need for wet wipes near the porcelain throne. A dab of Witch Hazel on regular toilet paper can perform the ""fresh and clean"" task just fine. As a bonus, it will do the job without exposure to unwelcome chemicals and without the potential of one day experiencing a sci-fi-like impenetrable blob that forces plumbing and sewer pipes to spew, spit, and belch back up what we have so unfortunately tossed down."

MacCoun, Ph.D., and Michelle M. Mello, J.D., Ph.D.From the Stanford Law School, the Freeman Spogli Institute, and Stanford University School of MedicineA striking feature of the rollout of the state-legalized retail sales of marijuana has been the tremendous popularity of edible marijuana products. Marijuana brownies have long been a staple of cannabis coffee shops in the Netherlands, but the new products are quite different. They are skillfully produced and packaged to closely mimic popular candies and other sweets. These products can now be purchased legally in four states; retail stores are operating in Colorado and Washington State, and voters recently approved retail sales in Alaska and Oregon.The new edibles raise public health concerns, including a risk of consumption by children. Although the states that have legalized recreational use of marijuana have only partially addressed these risks, many others -- including Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, and Vermont -- are likely to move legalization proposals forward, developments that may amplify the problem.Marijuana is associated with a long history of public misinformation and anxiety, and many observers will therefore view concerns about edibles with skepticism. Still, edibles that resemble sugary snacks pose several clear risks. One is overintoxication. Whereas consumers commonly assume that a candy bar constitutes a single serving, some of these products contain four or more times the level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that is considered to be a safe dose. (Colorado, for instance, set a standard size for an edible serving at no more than 10 mg of THC.) At high doses, THC can produce serious anxiety attacks and psychotic-like symptoms. This problem is augmented by differences in the pharmacokinetic and metabolic effects of marijuana when it is ingested rather than smoked. [1] In addition, case reports document respiratory insufficiency in young children who have ingested marijuana. [2]Although the use of marijuana remains illegal everywhere for people under 21 years of age, today's edibles are likely to appeal to children and young people. Even if consumption by minors is not intended by manufacturers, the packaging of edibles brings to mind the tort-law concept of the ""attractive nuisance"" -- a hazardous condition that is foreseeably likely to attract children who are unable to appreciate the risk involved. It also evokes tobacco companies' use of advertising campaigns with youth appeal, such as the long-running campaign featuring Joe Camel. [3]Whether through deliberate acquisition or unknowing consumption, these child-friendly edibles increase minors' risk of exposure to and experimentation with marijuana. [4] A recent study showed that the proportion of ingestion-related emergency department visits by young children in Colorado that were attributable to marijuana ingestion increased after legal restrictions were eased and that the majority of identified sources of the marijuana involved were edibles. [5] Accidental exposures are not the only reason for concern, however. Plausibly, the availability of child-friendly edibles could increase the probability of initiation to marijuana use, reduce the average age of initiation, and increase the frequency and intensity of use among users of all ages.Why have new kinds of marijuana edibles proliferated? The answer is simple: They appeal to consumers, and the ballot propositions that legalized marijuana use did not include rules prohibiting edibles in formulations and packages that appeal to children. In the face of intense lobbying from the new industry, Colorado and Washington State subsequently adopted fairly modest regulations for edibles. Both states require child-resistant packaging, a warning to ""keep out of the reach of children,"" and labeling describing a standard serving size. Neither requires warnings that ingested marijuana can have different effects from smoked marijuana. Both states prohibit packaging and advertising that specifically target children, but neither requires formulation or packaging that is clearly distinguishable from ordinary food products.The federal government does not regulate marijuana edibles. Marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which means that it's considered to have high potential for abuse, is not recognized as having any accepted medical use, and is not considered safe to administer even under medical supervision. As long as it remains on Schedule I -- a determination that has been periodically reconsidered -- it is outside the purview of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate as a drug, except in the context of research studies. The FDA could determine that marijuana edibles qualify as a food under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and seek to enforce regulations concerning food adulteration. Under the FDCA, foods must not contain additives that the FDA has not approved or that are not ""generally recognized as safe."" Marijuana arguably fails that standard, but the FDA has given no indication that it will assert its authority. Politically, the agency can't easily begin regulating marijuana sales while such sales remain federally prohibited.The Department of Justice could enter the scene, enforcing the CSA's marijuana prohibition against edibles companies and consumers. However, it has stated that enforcing the CSA against persons whose actions are in compliance with state and local law is not an agency priority -- though it left the door open for action where absent or anemic state regulations allow legalized marijuana to threaten key national interests such as preventing distribution to minors.As things stand, states have created a wide berth for marketing of marijuana edibles that federal agencies are unwilling or unable to narrow. But states can implement strong restrictions on the formulation, packaging, and marketing of these products at the time that they legalize medicinal or recreational use of marijuana. Child-resistant packaging is necessary but not sufficient; older children can easily defeat it. Clear labeling regarding THC doses and recommended serving sizes, along with warning labels about the risks of overconsumption, are also commonsense measures but won't protect young children. We believe that regulations should also impose substantive restrictions on product formulation and packaging aimed at reducing the likelihood that minors and other consumers will confuse marijuana and non-marijuana products. Restricting the extent to which marijuana edibles can look and taste like familiar sweets could also keep the psychological barriers to marijuana initiation among children and adolescents from being lowered. Finally, regulations could seek to reduce the risk of overconsumption by controlling and standardizing THC content. [4]The courts may serve as another avenue of regulation. Consumers who are injured by ingestion of edibles may bring personal-injury claims seeking damages against manufacturers and retailers. Judges and juries could well find credible consumers' claims that these products were negligently designed, since the risks of overdose and consumption by children are reasonably foreseeable and avoidable. Such lawsuits could make the effects of these products on health more salient for manufacturers -- but might be too infrequent and low-cost to spur adoption of more responsible business practices. Lawsuits would be more likely to draw attention to the problem than to obviate the need for formal regulations.Food companies could also bring trademark-infringement suits to prevent companies from marketing edibles that closely resemble their non-marijuana products. A Colorado edibles manufacturer recently settled such a suit with Hershey. The threat of litigation could deter companies from mimicking familiar candies and drinks, which may reduce the risk of inadvertent consumption by children, but it won't prevent manufacturers from marketing equally appealing products that are not outright mimics.Because legal channels are available to address the problems with marijuana edibles, such issues are not an argument against legalizing marijuana. Indeed, one potential advantage of legalization is that it provides more regulatory levers than are available under prohibition. Rather, the edibles problem is an argument against implementing legalization before an appropriate regulatory framework is in place. Though the ingenuity and swiftness with which manufacturers have formulated the new edibles have been surprising, the general problem was predictable. As legalization of marijuana spreads, new adopters should ensure that their regulatory scheme for marijuana edibles is fully baked.See the article, and read the comments, on NEJM.org.
