An AIDS-free generation: It seems an audacious goal, considering how the HIV epidemic still is raging around the world. Yet more than 20,000 international HIV researchers and activists will gather in the nation's capital later this month with a sense of optimism not seen in many years _ hope that it finally may be possible to stem the spread of the AIDS virus. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2a0c2100003300c5045b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Salimah EbrahimWASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - A U.S. health panel may soon make HIV testing as standard a practice as checking cholesterol levels, a move that would fundamentally change how the virus is detected and treated.The U.S. Preventive Services Task force, a government-backed group of clinicians and scientists, is expected to make a new recommendation on HIV screening available for public comment before the end of the year.Health officials close to the panel, speaking on condition of anonymity, see it making a positive recommendation for routine screening, updating their current position, issued in 2005, which leaves the decision up to doctors.Under President Barack Obama's healthcare law, passed in 2010, insurers are required to cover preventive services that are recommended by the task force.""This would be one of those major sea changes ... moving away from what has been somewhat the segmentation of HIV - either by population, by geography,"" said Michael Kharfen, chief of community outreach for the Washington, D.C., Department of Health. Kharfen, who worked on the frontlines of the HIV epidemic in New York in the 1980s, recalls when the prognosis for the disease was ""practically certain you were going to die.""It still will take culture change for medical providers, but this will be a tremendous leap,"" he said.The HIV/AIDs epidemic remains a significant health challenge in the United States, with an estimated 1.2 million people living with the disease. Of this group, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 20 percent are unaware of their infection.Nearly 60,000 new cases of the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS are reported nationally every year.The CDC and other prominent groups have already called for routine HIV screening as a way to reach a much broader population and reduce the stigma some associate with showing up at an HIV clinic. But a recommendation from the task force would carry greater weight, as the U.S. health reform law of 2010 will require insurers to cover preventive services it endorses.Global health officials have also stepped up the call for earlier treatment of people infected with HIV. New studies show that the latest HIV medications not only can extend the lives of patients for decades but are also one of the most potent ways of preventing their sexual partners from contracting the disease. Early treatment of HIV has been reported to cut transmission risk to uninfected partners by 96 percent.""All healthcare providers have a responsibility to find cases of HIV because we don't know where they are,"" said Dr. Lisa Fitzpatrick, who directs the United Medical Center, an HIV clinic in Washington. While doctors in the past focused on higher risk groups such as men who have sex with men, she said, ""HIV is in the general population now."" WEIGHING THE EVIDENCEIn 2006 the CDC recommended testing everyone between the ages of 13-64 at least once. They have since been joined by professional groups such as the American College of Physicians and the HIV Medicine Association.The fact that the CDC and the task force came to different conclusions, even in the face of similar evidence, is likely to have stemmed from differences in their respective missions.""We are looking at public health. The task force may be looking more at clinical care and the integration of prevention services within the clinical setting,"" said CDC Executive Director Kevin Fenton.The task force is charged with weighing the potential harm of a test against its possible benefits. In 2005 the panel was not convinced by the available evidence that widespread screening would have the desired effect of helping prevent new infections by changing the behavior of the patient who tested positive.""We did not find that evidence at that time compelling enough to say that we were confident that more people would benefit than the people who had HIV detected,"" said Dr. Michael LeFevre, co-chair of the task force.""Obviously that was seven years ago,"" he said, noting that new scientific evidence has since emerged showing that the very treatment of infected people can help prevent them from passing on the disease. He said that will be factored into the panel's recommendation this fall. THE COST EQUATIONWhile the task force doesn't factor cost into its considerations, the CDC and other healthcare providers do. Researchers at Stanford University estimate that over a 20-year period, expanding HIV testing to the general U.S. population would reach $27 billion dollars.A more cost-effective solution proposed by the researchers, and in line with CDC recommendations, would be to do a one-time screening of the general population, followed up by annual testing in areas with greater prevalence of the disease.Such a strategy would prevent an estimated 212,000 new infections and even lead to long-term healthcare savings, when the lifetime cost of $367,000 for HIV treatment is considered.Private initiatives have also sought to make HIV screening more accessible and affordable. The CDC has a pilot program with drugstore chain Walgreen Co and other pharmacies for free, rapid HIV tests, whose wholesale cost is about $20 each.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the first over-the-counter, self-administered HIV test from OraSure Technologies, which is expected to sell for $60. A positive result would require follow-up at a doctor's office.Adding an HIV screening to a routine blood exam would amount to $1.50 per patient.LeFevre, a primary care doctor in Missouri , cautions that the barriers to testing go beyond the rating of a single agency.""I can't think of another blood test in all of my practice that carries that baggage,"" he says of the pre-test consent, counseling, and post-test follow-up that HIV screening requires.United Medical Center's Fitzpatrick agrees.""This test is all about talking about sex and facing things about your patient that you feel uncomfortable facing,"" she said. ""For years this was considered a gay disease so doctors did not get into the habit of talking about HIV or thinking that their patients might have HIV because they may not have had gay patients or they might not have known they have gay patients."""

""Honey Boo Boo"" is the self-chosen nickname for 6-year-old Alana Holler, a regular on the TLC program ""Toddlers & Tiaras"" who became a breakout fan favorite and now stars in ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo"", which is a program all her own. Nearly 7 million people have viewed the video of her drinking her ""go go juice"" -- a concoction of an energy drink and a caffeinated soda (which early press accounts identified as Red Bull and Mountain Dew, but which are now blurred because those companies are apparently not sponsors) and nearly 3 million have watched Dr. Drew take his own taste.Among her fans, I learned this morning, are the Jonas Brothers. They too were in the ""green room"" at 30 Rock, and when the promo for my segment came on the monitor, the guys asked, ""Is she here? I'd love to meet her!"" (I didn't ask whether they have actually watched...)No, Alana herself was not in the building, I had to tell them, just me and Ada Calhoun, who wrote a piece for the LA Times this weekend titled ""Leave Honey Boo Boo's Mom Alone."" True, Ada wrote, June Shannon yells things like ""Shake your butt, baby"" during her daughter's performances, but concluded that criticism of Alana's mother is more about elitest disdain for a 300-pound self-described ""redneck"" than real concern about the quality of her parenting.Perhaps that is what some object to. My problem with the show, though, is that I can't help but project a decade or two in the future. A grown-up Alana will live forever with the image her mother is encouraging her to project before she can possibly understand the consequences.I don't doubt that the child is having fun now, or that her mother loves her fiercely. And Lord knows she is a mesmerizing dynamo. But no one who is watching -- not the TLC viewers, not the Jonas Brothers, not the talk show hosts who have been calling me all morning to weigh in -- are doing so because she is talented. They are watching to laugh at her. And I can't bring myself to do that to a child.Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy"

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2b212200005700d9231c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Bank of America said it will stop zombie checking accounts from coming back to life when they receive an automated electronic transaction. Starting this week, the bank will no longer allow electronic deposits or debits to reopen a closed checking account, according to bank spokeswoman Betty Reiss. ""We have been looking at [the change] since late last year and it just went into effect this week,"" Reiss told The Huffington Post by phone on Monday. The new rule marks a shift in bank policy, which previously allowed electronic transactions to reactivate an account after the customer had closed it. Reiss said the change was based on customer feedback. The Charlotte, N.C.-based bank wasn't alone in allowing electronic transactions to reopen old accounts. Complaints about checking accounts rising from the dead have long been a source of contention between customers and banks. As The Huffington Post reported earlier, the reopening of an old account can be unexpected at best and costly when overdraft fees and other charges pile up if automatic payments draw from an empty account. Electronic deposits and debits have become increasingly popular in recent years. Electronic banking is not only convenient, it has become a key way to avoid fees. For example, many accounts require a direct deposit to avoid a maintenance fee. For banks, electronic payments serve another purpose: customer retention. Untangling from a complicated web of automatic payments and deposits can be a major obstacle for consumers to switch banks. Nearly one in five customers said they considered switching banks in the last year, according to a recent survey from Consumers Union, but 63 percent said they did not switch because of automatic payments. In a report earlier this year, Consumer Union published recommendations for banks to help consumers move accounts. Among the suggestions was that a bank should be responsible for transferring automatic credits and debits from old to new accounts, rather than a consumer. This policy shift by Bank of America does not go nearly that far. Bank of America's Reiss stressed that it's up to the customer to notify depositors and creditors of new account information and to allow time for incoming payments or deposits to clear. "

Their legal split only took two weeks. But for the poorest of Americans, divorce is still a luxury item. Long-term separations are an alternative for poor couples who cannot afford to legally end their marriages, new research suggests. The research was presented at the American Sociological Association's annual meeting on Monday. The longitudinal study looked at 7,272 people who were surveyed on a regular basis between 1979 and 2008. Most people in the study who separated from a spouse reported getting a divorce within three years of the break up. But 15 percent of people who separated did not get a divorce within the first 10 years and researchers said there was an economic reason for it: They simply could not afford to get divorced, especially when there were children involved. The study found that the married-but-indefinitely-separated group generally had only a high school education, were black or Hispanic and had young children. ""Those with young children may find it difficult to support themselves and their children if they divorce,"" Zhenchao Qian, study co-author and professor of sociology at Ohio State University, said in a statement. ""Divorce may not protect them because their spouse may be unwilling or unable to provide financial support.""In the past, separations were usually linked to strict divorce laws that required one spouse to prove the other did something wrong -- they could have cheated or abandoned their partner. But today, as laws around ""no-fault"" divorces have become more lenient, researchers from the study suggested long-term separations are mostly done to avoid the financial stress of going through a divorce.There is no definitive cost to getting a divorce -- the cheapest ones can cost as little as several hundred dollars. Hiring a lawyer, who might charge anywhere between $200 and $400 per hour, to sort out child support payments can add up to thousands of dollars. But the financial costs and benefits of divorce extend beyond the lawyers and the paperwork. Married couples, especially those with children, get substantial benefits from filing joint tax returns or sharing health care coverage. But estranged marriages may not be limited just to low-income couples as the study indicated. A 2010 article in The New York Times suggested a new trend toward long-term separations among older professional-class couples who appear less inclined to get a legal divorce -- though perhaps more by choice rather than by necessity. Financial reasons such as shared real estate, retirement savings and health care coverage appeared to be the primary motivation for staying married by living apart. ""People split up and have these God-awful joint custody agreements, so you would think that they stay separated for the kids' sake, but I am not seeing that,"" couples therapist Toni Coleman told The New York Times. ""It usually comes down to the money.""While there are some financial benefits to long-term separation, there are also risks in remaining legally married, such as being liable for a spouse's debt or having to share earnings (even windfalls like a lottery win) that are considered community property in some states. But for couples who think that a separation only makes the heart grow fonder, the Ohio State study also revealed some disappointing news: 5 percent of couples who separated attempted to get back together -- but half of those ended up getting a divorce anyway."

She died at her home in Los Angeles, USA Today reported. She had been under hospice care. TMZ reported that her health had been declining since suffering a fall that resulted in an injured hip and wrist. While there is no word on whether this fall factored into her death, falls among the elderly are known to be especially dangerous. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that falls are the No. 1 cause of death from injury among people ages 65 and older. Plus, for 20 to 30 percent of seniors, a fall results in a serious injury like head trauma, laceration or hip fracture -- all of which can raise the risk of premature death. Nonfatal falls are also more common among the elderly. In the general population, falls occur in 43 out of every 1,000 people. But with people ages 75 and older, falls are more common, occurring in 115 people for every 1,000 people. In 2001, a study in the American Journal of Managed Care showed that the frequency of falls among Medicare users is the ""univariate predictor"" of death, hospitalization, placement in a nursing home or placement in a hospital. Plus, falls in the elderly could be a sign of worsened health in the first place, according to a 2000 article in the journal American Family Physician. And in addition to causing injury, these falls could have negative affects on daily functioning. The American Family Physician article explains why: Compared with elderly persons who do not fall, those who fall experience greater functional decline in activities of daily living (ADLs) and in physical and social activities, and they are at greater risk for subsequent institutionalization.To prevent falls among the elderly, the CDC recommends doing regular exercise (to build strength in the legs), paying attention to medication side effects (some may cause feelings of dizziness or tiredness), wearing glasses if you need them (so you can see properly and get around without falling), and keeping a tidy home (so you don't trip over miscellaneous items).

But now they aren't sure if the time is right.James Larkin, 51, a jet engineer at Pratt, has been through several boom-and-bust cycles, but describes automatic cuts as ""a ticking time bomb"" for him.With two teenagers at home, Larkin is worrying about how he will pay for college tuition if the cuts come. He's recruiting fellow employees to raise awareness and write to Congress.Corry Johnson, a 31-year-old hypersonic propulsion engineer, says he and his wife are holding off on buying a first home for their young family until there is more clarity on his job security.Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, is considering moving some engine-production work for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters -- and over 200 jobs -- to the Florida plant, but may re-evaluate this move if the F-35 production rate falls due to the pending defense cuts, Pratt President David Hess said.While the impact of the cuts is hotly debated in Washington, there's no doubt about the alarm felt by defense contractors, who have embarked on a campaign to publicize them. Their situation demonstrates that while Congress has learned to live with stalemates and stopgaps and last-minute cliff-hangers, the rest of America has not.The term ""do nothing Congress"" is a misnomer, suggests Johnson. Congress is doing something even when it's not, he says. ""When you're required to make a decision and you don't make one, that is a decision,"" he says.It was a year ago this month that lawmakers set in motion the $55 billion in defense cuts for the first year, to begin in early January, along with an equal amount of cuts in non-defense discretionary programs and agency budgets.The deal that ended a bitter fight on Capitol Hill over raising the debt limit will cut federal spending by $1.2 trillion over 10 years. AVERTING DEFAULTThe deal averted a historic default on U.S. Treasury debt and bought Congress and the Obama administration 17 months to find the deficit-reductions. The indiscriminate pain of the across-the-board cuts was meant to spur a congressional ""supercommittee"" to a deal. But it failed to do so.The supercommittee's work ended in acrimony last November, and election-year politics have prompted both Democrats and Republicans to hold fast to their positions.Democrats insisted on new tax revenues as part of the solution, while Republicans, spurred on by the fiscally conservative Tea Party movement, refused to consider tax hikes and insisted on cuts to Medicare and other entitlement programs favored by Democrats.The workforce at the sprawling Pratt complex in the swamps northwest of Palm Beach has seen its share of ups and downs at the hands of Washington's budget masters.It developed the engines that power many of today's jet fighters and decades of space launches -- Diaz' RL-10 blasted the current Mars Rover mission's second stage toward the planet. But the Space Shuttle program's termination and a consolidation of military engine programs has taken its toll.Employment, including a helicopter operation, is hovering around 1,600, down from around 8,000 in the plant's late 1990s heyday. But some employees say those upheavals are more understandable than the current threat, a creature of Congress' own making and so indiscriminate that no one has actually sorted out precisely where the cuts will hit.""There's definitely a tension. No one really speaks about sequestration on a day-to-day basis but it comes up around the water cooler,"" Johnson said. ""There's an uncertainty there that people are uncomfortable with.""But few are expecting movement on the cuts before the Nov. 6 presidential election. ""The partisanship will just get amped up,"" added Diaz. ""The rhetoric makes it difficult."" JUST FIX ITThe Pratt & Whitney engineers declined to assign fault to either party for their dilemma. Instead, they prescribed a practical problem-solving approach.""No blaming. Let's just fix it,"" Larkin said. ""Get the appropriate people to come together, set aside their differences and make a decision.""They've made that plea to their own elected official in Congress, Republican Representative Allen West, who is definitely one of those ""appropriate people.""West, a former Army lieutenant colonel and Tea Party favorite, voted in favor of the budget deal that set the cuts in motion, saying he did not want to play ""Russian roulette"" with a potential U.S. default.He vowed to workers at a Pratt & Whitney rally that he would cut short a five-week recess and return to Washington immediately if he could help work out a deal to avert the cuts.But with the campaign rhetoric accelerating, West did not offer much room for compromise. New revenue measures, as the Democrats want, remain unacceptable to him.""Why are we talking about raising taxes when there's so much uncertainty out there in the economy,"" West said, calling President Barack Obama's call for higher taxes on the wealthy a ""gimmick"" that won't produce much in revenues.""There's a lot of other places in Washington, D.C., where we can find the requisite amount of cuts,"" West added. ""I think we've got to get the federal government back in its right and proper roles and responsibilities.""West's Democratic opponent in his bid for a second term, Patrick Murphy, argues that West is responsible for the problem by vilifying Democrats as ""communists"" and backing Tea Party demands for deep spending cuts with no revenue gains.A study commissioned by the Aerospace Industries Association estimates that the automatic defense cuts could ultimately lead to the loss of over 1 million jobs. Add non-defense cuts and the number grows to over 2 million. "

(Photo by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2cf392400005000972b07.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paul Ryan's tax plan would have saved the presumptive Republican vice presidential candidate and his wife Janna about $22,000 in 2011, a calculation by The Huffington Post found. In 2011, Ryan and Janna paid $64,764 in taxes on income of $323,416, according to tax returns released Friday afternoon. If the tax code were rewritten as Ryan has proposed -- raising taxes for many lower-income taxpayers while reducing the tax burden for the wealthiest Americans, critics charge -- the family would owe about $43,000 in taxes. Ryan released his tax filings, which also include his return for 2010, in the midst of a controversy over whether his would-be boss should make public more of his own tax returns. Last week, Mitt Romney, who has thus far released his 2010 return and an estimated return for 2011, told reporters that he paid no less than 13 percent of his income in taxes for the past decade, in an effort to defuse an issue that has threatened to overshadow his economic message. Romney pays a lower rate than most middle-class taxpayers because most of his income comes from investments, which are taxed at a lower rate than traditional income. If his running mate had his way, Romney would pay much less. Ryan's plan would eliminate taxes on capital gains, on dividend income and on interest income, and would also do away with the alternative minimum tax. It would then tax everyone at one of two rates -- 10 percent for joint filers with income up to $100,000 a year; 25 percent on income above that level. The federal government would recoup some, but not all, of the lost revenue through the elimination of most deductions, including the popular mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for charitable giving. Ryan has said his plan would make the tax system flatter and simpler. Democrats have said killing the 15 percent capital gains tax would amount to a huge windfall to top earners. Romney, according to one estimate, would pay less than 1 percent of his income in taxes under the Ryan plan. The Ryans would benefit, too, but not nearly as much. That is because they land, income-wise, on the fulcrum between the middle class and the very wealthy. Their income comes mostly from two sources -- Paul Ryan's salary as a U.S. representative and investments inherited by Janna when her mother died in 2010. “These are properties Rep. Ryan ‘married into,’ for lack of a better term,” Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. “He does not play an active role in them and has no plans to.”The investment earnings helped push the couple's income up to six-and-a-half times the median income of about $51,000 in 2011. (That puts them in the top 3 percent of all earners, but they are paupers in comparison to Romney and his wife Ann, who with an estimated income of nearly $21 million in 2011 earned 409 times the median household income -- more each day than most families made all year). The Ryans in 2011 benefited from $51,242 in deductions from mortgage interest, charitable giving and previous tax bills. While the couple would lose those deductions, their base income would also not be as high. That's because they would no longer be taxed on $50,550 from gains on the sale of stock, or on dividend and interest income earned from other investments. They would also benefit from an increased standard deduction: $25,000 as joint filers, plus $3,500 each for the couple and their three children. All told, their tax bill would drop by about $22,000 if the deductions were eliminated and they no longer had to claim investment income. (This calculation does not take into account what the elimination of the current corporate tax under the Ryan plan might have on the income they earn through investments, nor does it include a tax credit most families would receive to purchase health care). Middle-class earners, in contrast, would see their tax bill rise sharply under the Ryan plan, according to a report published earlier this summer by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, authored by Sen. Robert Casey Jr. (D-Pa.).The average annual tax burden for earners in the $50,000 to $100,000 range would climb $1,358. Taxpayers in the $100,000 to $200,000 range would owe $2,257. Meanwhile, those making more than $1 million a year would save, on average, $286,543. Earners in the Ryans' peer group, those who earn $200,000 to $500,000, would save on average $2,257, according to the Joint Economic Committee report. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), vice chairman of the committee, has disputed its findings, saying that the report used data from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which defines income and taxes ""significantly differently than the IRS data used elsewhere,"" according to ABC News.Ryan's tax plan as written, of course, is at a significant distance away from reality. Such a drastic restructuring would probably have a tough time getting through even a Republican-dominated Congress unscathed, and besides, Romney has his own ideas. Though short on detail, Romney's proposed rewrite of the tax code would cut rates by 20 percent for everyone, and also eliminate the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax and the capital gains tax for all but wealthy taxpayers, he has said. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that in order for the tax plan to be revenue neutral, as Romney's advisers claim, it, too, would cause tax bills to rise for lower-income taxpayers -- a charge that Romney has vigorously disputed. In a recent interview with Brit Hume of Fox News, Ryan suggested that tax policy specifics would come after the election. ""That is something that we think we should do in the light of day, through Congress,"" Ryan told Hume, promising to ""have a process for tax reform so that we do this in the front of the public. ... [W]e want feedback from Americans about what priorities in the tax code should be kept, and what special interest loopholes we want to get rid of.""CORRECTION: In calculating the Ryans' likely tax burden under the plan previously put forward by the Republican vice presidential candidate, The Huffington Post failed to apply the lower 10 percent tax rate to the first $100,000 of their taxable income, and instead applied the 25 percent rate to the entire amount. That served to underestimate their likely tax savings by about $15,000. The story is revised to reflect the new calculation. "

Although the sophomore action flick effort beat out ""The Bourne Legacy"" and ""ParaNorman"" this weekend, it failed to outdo 2010's ""The Expendables,"" which brought in $34.8 million during its opening weekend. But, according to The Hollywood Reporter, ""The Expendables 2"" box office run is far from over. The film's beefed up cast (Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Liam Hemsworth are new additions to the gun-toting crew) and older-skewed audience should keep it going strong throughout the week. ""We think we'll have a great run,"" Lionsgate executive vice president of distribution David Spitz told THR. ""Older audiences don't rush out to the cinema on opening weekend.""""The Bourne Legacy,"" the first of the Bourne series to swap out Matt Damon for Jeremy Renner, came in second place with $17 million and the stop motion Focus Features adventure ""ParaNorman"" rounded out the top three with $14 million. But perhaps the biggest disappointment of the weekend was Whitney Houston's last film ""Sparkle."" Despite its positive reviews, the Motown movie, in which Jordin Sparks plays Houston's star gazing daughter, came in at No. 5 with $12 million. Click over to The Hollywood Reporter for more details.
