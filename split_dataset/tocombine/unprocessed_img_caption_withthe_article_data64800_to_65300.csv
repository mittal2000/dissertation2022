Sam manages to get to his feet and run away -- leaving part of his arm behind.“I don’t mean to be harsh, but I think Mr. Sam in a sense was getting what he deserved,” defense attorney James P. Harding told the Daily News. “My client is an absolute victim in this case.”Prosecutors see it differently, however, and charged Pierre with attempted murder.A man who identified himself as Pierre's cousin to ABC7 reacted in disbelief and anger to the charge.""If somebody pulls a gun [to] your head, and you're trying to get the cops to catch him, what would you do? You're telling me, just let him go?"" the man, identified only as Michael, told the station.Surgeons were reportedly able to reattach Sam's arm, which was severed below the elbow. He was found collapsed outside his mother's home nearby after fleeing the scene.The teen faces charges of robbery and criminal possession of a weapon.Also on HuffPost:"

6,STYLE,"Pyer Moss Puts On Yet Another Powerful Fashion Show, This Time Tackling Mental Health And Depression",Julee Wilson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pyer-moss-fall-2016-show_us_56bfef59e4b0c3c55051b4a0,Double bind.,2016-02-14,Fashion designer Kerby Jean-Raymond and stylist and singer-songwriter Erykah Badu pose backstage at the Pyer Moss Fall 2016 fashion show.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c0957b1a00002d00ab2a12.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kerby Jean-Raymond is a rare breed -- he is a fashion designer that is dedicated to serving up his expertly executed designs for the label Pyer Moss with a side of in-your-face social commentary. Jean-Raymond’s spring 2016 collection, which was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, was arguably one of the most talked about and powerful shows last September, thanks to the screening of a short film depicting horrific cases of police brutality against black men and women, and designs emblazoned with phrases like “I can’t breathe” and boots splattered with blood. On Saturday afternoon, during the presentation of his fall 2016 collection, titled “Double Bind,” the 28-year-old designer turned his attention to yet another pressing issue: depression. To be sure, mental illness is certainly a universal condition, but it is largely (and sadly) seen as taboo within the black community.""All my collections are based on something I like or something I’m dealing with. They are always deeply personal,” Jean-Raymond told The Huffington Post, adding that he suffered from a period of depression following his Black Lives Matter show. And while the New York City-based designer admits the discussion surrounding depression is usually ""swept under the rug"" in black culture, the topic was on full display at his show, which was styled by Grammy Award-winning singer and doyenne of cool Erykah Badu. Before even a stitch of clothing was sent down the runway, the tone was set by the show's music. The presentation, under the creative direction of Dario Calmese, was soundtracked by a live, all-black choir composed of classically trained opera singers. Dressed in white hospital gowns -- a distinct nod to the topic of mental illness -- the vocalists performed operatic renditions of Future's ""Trap N****as"" and Fetty Wap's ""RGF Island"" (it was ""traopera,"" or trap music-meets-opera), as well as the black national anthem, ""Lift Every Voice and Sing.""Once models started filing down the runway, the theme crystallized with designs printed with phrases like “I have no friends in LA” and “Why so blue,"" as well as pins reading the names of various drugs and substances often used to medicate mental illness -- including Prozac, Zoloft, Molly, booze and LSD. The messaging was consistent until the very end, when the last model walked out holding a sign that read: “My demons won today. I’m sorry.” The message was the last Facebook status shared by MarShawn M. McCarrel II, a Black Lives Matter activist and founder of Pursuing Our Dreams, who killed himself outside the Ohio Statehouse on Monday.""I think the whole world is depressed,"" Badu told HuffPost, but noted that she hasn't personally suffered from any type of clinical depression. ""We mask it in different ways -- technology is one of the ways we've found as a group to mask it. Normal bouts of depression are very common -- for all of us -- and we don’t really discuss it and talk about it, we just kind of numb it some kind of way.”Jean-Raymond says that Badu was ""very hands on"" throughout the whole process of pulling the collection together. ""She was up until 2 o'clock in the morning making those buttons and sewing all the hats,"" he said. Speaking of hats, those used in the show -- styled after hats used by chauffeurs and other working-class professionals -- were also on theme. “Kerby wanted to communicate that working-class people deal with depression every day,” Badu said. “The deeper conversation needed to be had and I think through this performance art and fashion show it was discussed. And hopefully creates a little dialogue about it -- a little more than usual.”While direct messages about depression were literally printed on some of the designs, the collection was actually uplifting. Jean-Raymond's sweet spot has always been sportswear. While his latest effort won't alienate fans of that signature elevated athleisure, this is his “most mature collection aesthetically,” according to the designer. And, we'd also add, his most wearable. The mens- and womenswear collection offered up sophisticated overcoats, cozy shearling outerwear, tailored drawstring trousers -- and there was even a tuxedo in the mix. In addition, Jean-Raymond developed luxe fabrics, including a rose gold-hued leather and silk-and-cashmere blended denim. A quick Google search of the collection's title, ""Double Bind,"" yields this definition: ""a situation in which a person is confronted with two irreconcilable demands or a choice between two undesirable courses of action."" That may have been the premise of Jean-Raymond's inspiration for the collection, but there were no mixed messages in terms of his designs. It's crystal clear that his provocative point of view on clothing and the world we live in is needed -- and that makes us very, very happy.

Even when you're suffering with your own pain. And don't assume that someone else has it easier than you. You never know the battles someone else is fighting.,2016-02-14,2016-01-19-1453238565-6719551-dreamstime_xs_32942082.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-01-19-1453238565-6719551-dreamstime_xs_32942082-thumb.jpg,"We've all heard the quote, 'Be Kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.' For most of us who are grieving the loss of someone we love, we imagine that we are the brave ones on the battlefield, fighting our hard battle in solitude.My husband and son died within two years of each other. From my personal experience, I believe that if we aren't careful, grief can become a rather self-involved process in which we can become so focused on our own suffering that we miss the opportunity to connect with, and possibly bring comfort to, someone else who may be going through a similar experience.Six months after my husband died, I was sinking in the quicksand of grief. I could not pull myself out of the misery. I felt like I was completely alone in the experience. Who could possibly begin to understand my pain?In that moment, I actually believed that my life was more difficult than anyone else around me. Life, persistent teacher that it is, handed me a perfectly wrapped lesson that opened my eyes to the fact that through my suffering I had allowed myself to become blinded by my self-pity. The lesson presented itself in a health crisis. I had complications from a surgical procedure and ended up being hospitalized for four days. I was in an extreme amount of pain during this time. Between the physical pain and the emotional pain of grief, I was an absolute mess.I should also tell you that I am a Registered Nurse. As a nurse, it is hard to be on the receiving end of medicine as the patient. But, it is even harder to be the nurse who is required to take care of the sick nurse patient. As all nurses know, we are watching every move the other nurse makes. The first three nights that I was in the hospital, the same nurse took care of me. She was young, maybe in her mid to late 20s, and she hardly interacted with me at all the first two nights, other than to give my medications as scheduled. I, the experienced and compassionate nurse that I was (inject sarcasm here), judged her to be a poor nurse. She obviously had no idea how much emotional pain I was in. How hard is it to ask your patient how she's feeling? I wrote her off as a bad nurse who had little empathy, and remained absorbed in my own emotional and physical pain.The third night the young nurse was a little more talkative. She asked me how I was feeling (finally!). I told her that I was struggling with depression and grief because my husband had died in an airplane accident.She looked at me and told me that her husband had died too, just two months earlier.I was stunned. Speechless. Shocked.Never, in any of the possibilities that my mind entertained of why this nurse was so stand-offish with me, did I even consider that she might be in the same pain I was. Not only was she grieving as I was, but she was having to take care of me, instead of caring for herself and her family.We went on to talk and share our stories about our late husbands and children. I like to think that we helped each other a bit that night.We had much more in common than I would have believed. We were both widowed single moms with young children, and nurses. But, that was where the similarities ended. Her husband had no insurance policy. She had very little family support. She was working paycheck to paycheck to support her boys. I was humbled. I realized how much I had to be grateful for. And, frankly, I never saw life the same way after this experience.Although I would still go on to struggle with complicated grief, I would never be so self-absorbed in my grief again. This experience was a life-changing event for me.  I had always prided myself on being an empathetic person, but I realize now that I had not really understood what being empathetic meant. To truly be empathetic, you must be able to see beyond your own pain to be witness to the pain in someone else's eyes. When you only see your own pain, your view is cloudy and your perception of others is skewed.I never looked at another person in the same way after this experience.The cashier checking me out at the grocery store who seemed rude and in a hurry? Who knows what was going on in his day, week, life? Maybe he recently lost a spouse or a child. Maybe he has experienced compounded losses. I had no way of knowing what this man was going through. Who was I to judge him?The woman cleaning tables at a restaurant, groaning as if she was in emotional or physical pain while wiping the tables...before, I might have thought that she was a 'whiner' or maybe even a little lazy. But, I had no idea what was happening in her life. She was fighting her own battle.I thank death for very few things. The gift of empathy for my fellow man, and understanding that we all suffer in ways that aren't always visible, are presents from death that I will always be grateful for.Always take the time to be kind. Even when you're suffering with your own pain. And don't assume that someone else has it easier than you. You never know the battles someone else is fighting.This post is part of Common Grief, a Healthy Living editorial initiative. Grief is an inevitable part of life, but that doesn't make navigating it any easier. The deep sorrow that accompanies the death of a loved one, the end of a marriage or even moving far away from home, is real. But while grief is universal, we all grieve differently. So we started Common Grief to help learn from each other. Let's talk about living with loss. If you have a story you'd like to share, email us at strongertogether@huffingtonpost.com."

Kasich is campaigning in New Hampshire ahead of the primary which will be held on February 9. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb9320d210000d601c97f16.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Republicans need to rally around John Kasich and they need to do it now if they have any hope of winning the general election. There is no time to wait until things play out, because the way things look they will play out badly for the GOP. Badly for the presidential election and badly down the line. The Senate will be gone and the House will be at risk. How the Election Plays Out From Here:Trump and Cruz will split the anger vote, which seems to be just around 45 percent, but Trump will edge Cruz out. The three establishment candidates will continue to hit each other and split the electability vote. All except for Governor Kasich have the resources to fight for months. In state after state they will each get in double digits. No one has enough support to win, but most have enough support to stay in, hoping for a one-on-one battle. Thus we will probably go to the convention with Trump leading in delegates, but not having enough to secure the nomination, the ensuing fight will lose the minority and independent vote for a generation.I don't know if the establishment does conference calls, but if so they need to get together and rally behind the adult in the room asap. That adult is Governor John Kasich. I am talking to you Roger Ailes, Rush Limbaugh, Koch Brothers, Senator Mitchell, Speaker Ryan and Montgomery Burns. Here are our three reason why.Jeb! is Never Going to Win But He Will Continue:Jeb is hopelessly establishment in a time when that is simply unacceptable. The fact of the matter is that someone running on his record as Governor of Florida over a decade ago, with his personality, but a different last name, would not stand a chance. But he is a Bush, therefore has the money and infrastructure to keep going. His hope is that if it gets down to him and Trump he can win. So he will stick it out and continue to split the electability vote, but never will have enough appeal to win. For the good of the party, Jeb must just drop out now.Rubio is Damaged Beyond Saving But He Will Continue:Maybe it was Governor Christie's attack in the debate that Rubio is just a political stump speech with nice hair. Maybe it was Senator Santorum's 'well he hasn't actually accomplished anything' endorsement. But Rubio has money and he is a brilliant orator, and also thinks if it gets down to him and Trump he can win. However the line of attack on Senator Rubio is too clear and he has no rebuttal, because it is true. For the good of the party, Marco must drop out now. However, young, charismatic, latino from a swing state has VP written all over it...Trump and Cruz Will Cause Havoc Down the Line and They Will Fight to Cleveland: Neither Trump or Cruz can win. They both are big men in little tents. Their negative ratings are too high, their positions and approaches too divisive. However, neither will drop out for the good of the party as part of their appeal is that they hate the party. They will attack each other, they will attack the establishment, they will attack anything that they want, in a scorched earth approach that will leave Republican voters at home and independents flocking to the Democrats. They both have money and conviction, and will continue to Cleveland.Thus GOP Must Unite ASAP Behind the Guy Who Can Win:The only way to stop Cruz and Trump is to rally around the uninspiring, no-sound-byte, rather moderate and bridge building, boring Governor of Ohio. However, the sad reality is the in today's theatrical, big donor fueled political environment, Governor Kasich needs help and he needs it quickly. He needs super-donors to start funding him. I am talking to you Ken Griffin ($3 million to Marco), Hank Greenberg ($10 million to Jeb), Paul Singer ($3 million to Marco), Miguel Fernandez ($3 million to Jeb) and Norman Braman ($6 million to Marco). And of course to the most important uncommitted donors the Koch Brothers and Sheldon Adelson. For the fun of it let's get a Governor Mitt Romney endorsement. (To be clear, I think all the mass donations in politics is an abomination but it's what the law allows now and Governor Kasich needs it or he won't make it in this race).If Kasich fades after SC, you will have four people that will split the vote, not drop out and bring the GOP to ruin. If you rally behind Kasich and he wins SC, Jeb and Marco will go and Kasich can beat Trump and Cruz and unite the party.Sadly, Trump has probably done enough damage that you can't win swing states like New Mexico and Colorado anymore, and without them your path to the White House is pretty bleak. So it may all be for naught, but it's worth a shot and John Kasich is the only shot you got. Take it."

Submarines were not a particularly new idea. The concept of an undersea boat had first been suggested by the Renaissance genius Leonardo da Vinci. After the defeat of the Venetian fleet at the Battle of Zonchio in August 1499, he proposed to the Doge of Venice an undersea craft that could approach the Turkish galleys and drill holes in their hulls in order to sink them. He even designed the first primitive wet suit and a system of using air filled bladders to refloat the sunken warships. Da Vinci asked for half of whatever ransom was obtained by Venice for the return of any captured Ottoman officers and seamen. By 1515, he had designed a prototype submersible, although it does not appear it was ever actually built.In 1578, the British mathematician William Bourne also designed plans for a submersible craft. It was not until 1620, however, that the first submarine was actually built. Cornelius van Drebbel, a Dutch inventor, built the first submersible by tightly wrapping a wooden rowboat in greased, waterproofed leather. The underwater ship had air tubes with floats to the surface to provide oxygen. It was powered by 12 oarsmen. The oars then went through leather gaskets in the hull. In its first trip in the Thames River, this first primitive submarine remained submerged for three hours.The American inventor David Bushnell built the first submarine actually deployed militarily in 1776. Dubbed the Turtle, it was a one-man, wooden submarine powered by hand-turned propellers. During the American War of Independence it was deployed against British warships at anchor. The Turtle would approach the ships and attach explosives to their hulls. The explosives, however, failed to go off underwater and little came of the effort.Robert Fulton, an American inventor living in France, designed and built a second submarine, the Nautilus, between 1793 and 1800. Jules Verne adopted the name for the submarine in his novel ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."" The submarine was roughly 21 feet long and six feet in the beam. It was built out of copper sheets affixed to a wooden frame. The craft looked remarkably modern, not unlike contemporary small research submarines.The Nautilus carried a naval mine called a ""carcass."" The device consisted of a variously sized copper cylinder containing anywhere from 10 pounds to 200 pounds of gunpowder. The submarine would approach a ship, drive a spiked eye into its hull, and then speed away while simultaneously releasing the cable that passed through the eye and attached to the ""carcass."" When the mine came into contact with the ship's hull, a detonator, a gunlock mechanism, would set off an explosion. The submarine could stay underwater for up to eight hours and proved to be remarkably effective, notwithstanding a tendency to leak. Fulton proposed to the French government that it build a fleet of submarines to counteract British naval power. Napoleon lost interest in the project, however, and nothing came of it. The British Admiralty was sufficiently alarmed by Fulton's proposal that they hired him to come to England and design submarines for the Royal Navy. After the British victory at Trafalgar, however, the project was abandoned. Over the balance of the 19th century a number of countries experimented with primitive submarine designs. Both the Union and Confederate navies deployed submarines during the American Civil War. The Chilean Navy built a submarine during the Chincha Islands War. Other countries that developed submarines during this period included Peru, Ecuador, Great Britain, France, and Prussia. During this period the first torpedo design also began to emerge. None of these early submarines, however, proved to be particularly useful. Most sank while still being tested. The modern era of submarine design began in the 1890s, when two rival American inventors, Simon Lake and John P. Holland, developed competing designs for the first true submarines. The U.S. Navy purchased Holland's design, while Russia and Japan opted for Lake's version. Their submarines used gasoline driven steam engines for surface cruising and electric motors for traveling submerged. Both inventors also invented the electric motor driven torpedo, ushering in the era of submarine warfare. Anti-submarine net at the approach to Halifax harbor, 1915The first German submarine was designed by the Bavarian inventor and engineer Wilhelm Bauer, and was built by Schweffel and Howaldt in Kiel in 1850. It was intended to end the Danish naval blockade during the First Schleswig War (1848-1852). The submarine carried a three man crew and was designed to approach enemy ships while they were at anchor and attach explosives to their hulls. Named the Brandtaucher, ""Fire-diver,"" it sank on its first test dive in Kiel harbor. It was rediscovered in 1887, raised in 1903, and placed in a museum.The modern era of German submarine construction began with the ""Nordenfelt"" design of submarines. These steam powered submarines were the result of a collaboration between a Swedish engineer, Thorsten Nordenfelt, and a British reverend, George Gannet. A number of submarines were built but they proved unstable. These were followed in 1906, by the Karp class, a double hulled, kerosene engine driven, single torpedo tube submarine. The SM class, the next evolution on German submarine design, was deployed in 1908, starting with the U-2. These boats were 50 percent bigger and had two torpedo tubes. Diesel engines were installed beginning with U-19. At the beginning of the war in August 1914, the Imperial German Navy had a total of 48 submarines across 13 different ""classes,"" or designs, either built or under construction. The German word for submarine is Unterseeboot, which was shortened to U-boat, and remains the German designation for submarines from World War I to the present day. The first ship sunk by a self-propelled torpedo fired from a U-boat was the HMS Pathfinder. It was sunk by SM U-21 on September 5, 1914.Initially, the British Admiralty had dismissed the use of submarines as a threat to surface warships. The steady success of German submariners against Royal Navy ships, and the realization that German submarines could sink British battleships, caused a re-evaluation of the threat that they presented. The danger posed by U-boats was underscored when SM U-9 sank three British armored cruisers on the afternoon of September 22 1914. At first, British anti-submarine countermeasures were largely ineffective. At the time there was no means of identifying submerged submarines much less attacking them. Most submarines that were destroyed had been on the surface and were attacked either by ramming or by surface fire. In a throwback to ancient naval tactics, a number of British warships designated for anti-submarine warfare were even outfitted with specially designed rams on their bow to sink German submarines. A primitive form of depth charge had been developed in 1913, by taking a standard Mark II mine and fitting it with a hydrostatic pistol pre-set to detonate at 45 feet below the surface. Called a ""dropping mine,"" it could be effective to 100 feet below the surface, well within the effective depth that WWI era submarines could reach. The device carried a charge of 1,150 pounds of explosive and the resulting explosion could pose a danger to the ship dropping it. The first effective depth charges did not become available until January 1916, with the introduction of the Type D depth charge. These were the familiar barrel shaped design and carried a charge of either 300 pounds or 120 pounds of TNT. Slower ships used the smaller charge to ensure that the resulting explosion wouldn't damage them. For most of the war, however, demand for the depth charges exceeded the supply and most ships rarely carried more than two depth charges. Depth charges aboard the HMS FanningThe first successful depth charge attack was against U-68 off Kerry, Ireland on March 22, 1916. Over the course of the war a total of 74,441 depth charges were issued by the Royal Navy, 16,451 of which were fired, resulting in 38 outright ""kills,"" and aiding in the subsequent destruction of 140 more U-boats.There were a variety of tactics employed in defending against U-boat attacks. The most effective tactic was turning toward the U-boat and attempting to ram it. If the boat submerged, the merchant ship's superior speed over a submerged U-boat would allow it to escape. Over half of all attacks against merchant ships by U-boats were defeated in this way. World War I era torpedoes had a range of between 1,640 and 3,380 yards. The range eventually increased to 9,190 yards. Ranges were based on an average speed of 27 knots. At the top speed of 35 knots, the range, even on later models, would drop by 60 percent--to between 2,400 to 3,800 yards. German U-boats had a submerged speed of about seven to eight knots versus those of merchant vessels on the surface of between 11 and 13 knots. That meant that within 15 to 30 minutes a merchantman could open up a distance between itself and an attacking submarine to place it beyond torpedo range. A second option was either arming merchant ships for self-defense, or arming and manning decoy ships with concealed deck guns. These were the so-called Q ships. If a U-boat surfaced, Q ships could engage and sink it. There were never enough Q ships to make a real difference, however, and U-boats rarely surfaced. The Germans argued that such tactics put merchant ships outside the protection of the Cruiser Rules. Since the Germans weren't abiding by those rules anyway, the point was largely academic. In total, sixteen U-boats were destroyed over the course of 1915, by these various tactics. In return the U-boats sank a total of 370 ships totaling 750,000 Gross Registeedr Tons (GRT).In 1916, the Germans returned to a strategy of using U-boats to reduce the British Grand Fleet's numerical superiority. The plan was to stage a series of operations that would lure the British Fleet into an ambush, a killing zone, where prepositioned U-boats could open fire without warning as the fleet approached. Since the U-boats could not keep up with the faster battleships, they would have to be prepositioned in patrol lines while the German Fleet acted as bait to draw the British Fleet into the trap. A number of these operations were staged in March and April of 1916 with no success. They were repeated in August and October, again with no success. It is likely that the British Admiralty's knowledge of German Naval codes gave it ample warning of the proposed ambushes. Torpedoes being loaded on a German WW I era submarineIronically, no U-boats were present at the one fleet action that did take place--the Battle of Jutland. Since the fleet engagement had occurred largely by chance, there was not enough time to preposition U-boats in the area, nor were there any U-boats in the vicinity when the battle occurred.The submarine came into its own as a naval weapon during the First World War. Over the course of the war German U-boats sank around 5,000 ships with a combined capacity of about 13 million GRT at a cost of losing 178 submarines and 5,000 men in combat. Had Germany been able to deploy sufficient numbers, submarines might well have changed the outcome of the war. Since then, along with surface ships and naval air forces, the submarine has become a critical element of the triad that constitutes naval power in the modern world."

With the arrival of the iceberg, breeding Adelie penguins near the cape must now travel almost 40 miles in search of food. The exhausting trek has caused the colony to diminish from 160,000 penguins to just 10,000, an alarming new study by Antarctic Science found.Chris Turney, a climate change professor with the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, has been tracking the penguin decline.""It's eerily silent now,"" Turney told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""The ones that we saw at Cape Denison were incredibly docile, lethargic, almost unaware of your existence. The ones that are surviving are clearly struggling. They can barely survive themselves, let alone hatch the next generation. We saw lots of dead birds on the ground ... it's just heartbreaking to see.""However, a penguin researcher who was not involved in the study said there is no definitive proof that the penguins have died. They may have just relocated.""Just because there are a lot fewer birds observed doesn't automatically mean the ones that were there before have perished,"" Michelle LaRue, who studies penguin populations at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, told Live Science. ""They easily could have moved elsewhere, which would make sense if nearby colonies are thriving.""If it's true that 93 percent of the penguin population is already dead, researchers estimate that in 20 years the rest of the colony will be completely wiped out. But even so, LaRue told The Weather Network the colony accounts for just a small portion of the 3.8 million breeding pairs of Adelie penguins worldwide.""150,000, even lets [sic] just assume they did all die, that certainly is not apocalyptic,"" LaRue told the publication.This piece has been updated to include penguin researcher Michelle LaRue's comments that the penguins may have simply relocated.CORRECTION: This piece previously misidentified the journal that published the study as ""Atlantic Science""; it is Antarctic Science.

He was 79.Local officials initially claimed that the cause of death was a heart attack but later stated that the official cause will not be determined for several days. A staunch Catholic, Scalia received last rites from a local priest, according to The New York Times.Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement that Scalia's death is a ""great loss to the Court and the country he so loyally served.""""On behalf of the Court and retired Justices, I am saddened to report that our colleague Justice Antonin Scalia has passed away. He was an extraordinary individual and jurist, admired and treasured by colleagues,"" he said.President Barack Obama remembered Scalia as ""larger than life"" and ""one of the most consequential judges and thinkers to serve on the Supreme Court.""Obama also said he plans to fill his now-vacant seat.""I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibility to nominate a successor in due time,"" he said, adding that he expects the Senate to confirm him in due course. He also expressed condolences to Scalia's wife, Maureen, and surviving family.The looming nomination and future of the Supreme Court has already raised the stakes of the 2016 presidential election -- with leading conservatives in Congress saying that the task should be left up to the next president.But Scalia's sudden death also leaves in flux a slate of high-stakes cases the court has already heard or is about to hear -- including contentious battles over immigration, affirmative action, abortion and the future of public-sector unions.Without Scalia's voice or vote, these deeply politicized cases -- expected to be decided along ideological lines -- are at risk of resulting in 4-4 ties. That means the decision will leave whatever prior court ruling as the final word and will not create any legal precedent. Scalia had served on the Supreme Court since his 1986 appointment by President Ronald Reagan. At the time of his death, he had been the longest sitting justice on the Supreme Court -- which, under the court's seniority rules, sat him just to the right of Chief Justice Roberts.Known for his clear, sometimes bombastic prose, he was a leading proponent of ""originalism"" -- the belief that the text of the U.S. Constitution should be interpreted as the founders would have understood the document.Scalia admitted the method was imperfect, but defended it as better than any alternative method of constitutional interpretation.""I don’t have to prove that originalism is perfect... It’s not perfect,"" he said. ""The question is whether it’s better than anything else. And it is.""Originalism's imperfections were in full view in 2008's District of Columbia v. Heller, one of Scalia's most controversial -- and history-making -- decisions.Writing for a five-justice majority, Scalia used historical definitions to argue that the Second Amendment conferred an individual the right to own a handgun for self-defense in the home. It was the first time that the Supreme Court had enshrined such a right in constitutional law -- but the ruling threw the law on guns into confusion, and to date the court has refused to clarify it.As Scalia liked to point out, originalism didn't always lead him to the result he would have personally preferred. He frequently discussed his vote with a 5-to-4 majority in Texas v. Johnson, in which the court held that flag burning was protected under the First Amendment, as an example of when originalism had led him to a conclusion that was against his personal preferences. ""If it were up to me, I would put in jail every sandal-wearing, scruffy-bearded weirdo who burns the American flag. But I am not king,"" he said.Scalia's lesser-known but far more influential legacy on the court and the law is what is now known as textualism -- the faithful adherence to what the text of the law, as written by Congress, says. That view led him to really dislike divining congressional intent from committee reports, floor statements and other legislative action that didn't make it into written legislation.In a back-and-forth with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) during his 1986 confirmation hearing, Scalia sharply disagreed with Grassley on the importance of committee reports for the interpretation of statutes. ""Senator, Congress does not act in committee reports,"" Scalia said. ""I will say that flat out. Congress acts by passing a law.""Today, both liberal and conservative judges and scholars largely agree that is the legislative text that prevails when interpreting statutes, and that secondary materials should be consulted only as a matter of last resort. When not leaving a mark with his jurisprudence, Scalia left a mark with his scathing, often sarcasm-riddled dissents -- protesting vociferously on every major pro-gay rights ruling and the two big challenges to the Affordable Care Act. Dissenting in last June's Obergefell v. Hodges, which declared same-sex marriage legal nationwide, Scalia said he'd rather ""hide my head in a bag"" than join the court's vapid majority opinion.""The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie,"" he said. That's only a small sampling of a large oeuvre.He was also extremely close friends with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the court's most liberal justices. The two shared a love of opera and were even photographed together riding an elephant during a 1994 trip to India.Scalia didn't appear to have any plans for retiring from the Court anytime soon, telling The Associated Press in October that he would step down once he felt he no longer could do his job to the best of his ability.""As soon as I think I'm getting lazier and I just can't do the job as well, I'm going to get off there. I want to preserve whatever reputation I have,"" Scalia said. ""If you've lost your smarts, yeah, you should get off. But that hasn't been the case.""It's extremely rare for a sitting Supreme Court justice to die while on the bench. The last time it happened was in September 2005, when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died.Born to Italian immigrants in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1936, Scalia received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University and the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, before earning an LLB degree from Harvard. Prior to serving on the Supreme Court, Scalia served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit -- often seen as the second-most important federal court in the country.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Scalia had an LLM degree; he had an LLB.This story has been updated to indicate Scalia's cause of death remains undetermined.Also on HuffPost:"

Plummeting global oil prices have left a gaping hole in Nigeria's budget.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56be7ade1800002d0080be6f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, we bring you one overlooked aspect of stories that made news in recent days. Did you notice the media forgot all about another story's basic facts? Tweet @TheWorldPost or let us know on our Facebook page.The crash in global oil prices has pushed Nigeria -- Africa’s biggest economy -- into economic crisis, with potentially dangerous implications for civilians vulnerable to attack by militant group Boko Haram.The price of U.S. crude oil has plummeted by 75 percent since mid-2014. That’s a disaster for Nigeria, which depends on revenue from its oil production to fund about three-fourths of the government’s budget.Nigeria’s oil revenues have fallen dramatically, and the country's currency, the naira, has dropped 50 percent in value on the black market. The country expects to run a record deficit in 2016 -- around $15 billion. President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration is seeking to borrow some $9 billion to plug the budget shortfall.The economy is far from the only crisis on the government’s plate. The Boko Haram insurgency has raged for over six years in the northeast and has left at least 30,000 dead. While Nigeria’s military has recaptured territory from Boko Haram in the past year, the extremist group continues to sow carnage across northeast Nigeria, including recent attacks on a village and camp for displaced people that killed over 100 Nigerians.“These oil prices could not have come at a worse time,” said J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center.For one thing, Nigeria is trying to train and equip an under-resourced army used mostly for international peacekeeping missions to become a fighting force capable of engaging the Boko Haram insurgency. Nigeria has increased military spending over the past decade -- the total security budget reached almost $6 billion in 2015. But that’s barely making up for years of underinvestment that had been designed to discourage military coups and to minimize losses to corruption, Pham said. For example, Nigeria’s former national security adviser is accused of stealing $2 billion from the security budget.Nigeria’s military needs more investment, as well as better management of its resources, said Raymond Gilpin, dean of the National Defense University’s Africa Center for Strategic Studies. Nigeria doesn’t release a breakdown of its security budget, and some military spending remains opaque. “There’s no use having all the latest military toys, but not a motivated and capable workforce” Gilpin said.Falling oil prices also have affected Nigeria’s neighbors -- Niger, Chad and Cameroon -- and may be hurting the region's efforts to form a coordinated response to Boko Haram. The militant group operates in the remote border zone between these countries, slipping across porous frontiers when under attack. Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, plus Benin, formed a multinational joint task force to cooperate against the group. Since Buhari’s election last March, the president has tried to revitalize the initiative, and the five countries have agreed to contribute to a 8,700-strong force to take on Boko Haram. But the deployment of the force has been repeatedly delayed amid a shortfall in funds. Niger, Chad and Cameroon also depend on oil revenues. The African Union said last week that just $250 million of the force’s $700 million budget has been pledged so far, and $110 million of that has come from Nigeria.The hole in Nigeria’s budget also could endanger what experts say is an important long-term strategy against Boko Haram -- revitalizing the impoverished northeast region of the country where the group is based. “North Nigeria in general lags behind south Nigeria on almost every indicator of well-being -- and the northeast lags behind the rest of the north,” Pham said. “And thanks to Boko Haram, it will get worse.”North Nigeria’s once-vibrant textile and leather industry has been decimated by mismanagement and Chinese imports. The life source for trade and agriculture in the region -- Lake Chad -- has shrunk to around one-tenth of its size in recent decades due to climate change and overuse. Now, towns across the northeast have been destroyed by fighting between Boko Haram and government forces; over 2 million people have fled their homes.Without a serious plan for ending poverty and political marginalization of the region, “it’s easy for Boko Haram to co-opt communities to support them,” said Gilpin. “If they feel they don’t belong anywhere, it’s easier for them to side with a group who provides a sense of community and belonging,” he said.Boko Haram took control of swaths of northeast Nigeria before last year’s military offensive, and the region’s institutions -- such as business associations, courts, and local government -- now need to be re-established from the ground up.“Nigeria will have to rebuild the entire economic system in the northeast,” Gilpin said. “It’s going to take north Nigeria at least a decade to turn around.” Nigeria has asked the World Bank and the African Development Bank for funding, and the World Bank is developing a plan to stimulate the economy in the northeast. Nigerian officials told Reuters this week the country is also asking China for a loan of up to $2 billion. There’s no guarantee of success. Countries are already cautious due to volatility in global markets, and the Nigerian government is resisting pressure from international lenders to devalue its currency.Yet the international finance institutions may be more supportive due to Buhari’s efforts to clean up Nigeria’s finances, said John Campbell, senior fellow for Africa policy studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria. “Buhari’s anti-corruption drive has earned international credibility,” he said. “He has really gone after big fish.”Despite Nigeria’s economic woes, Gilpin said now could be the ideal time to kick-start and diversify the country's economy. “A post-Boko Haram rebuilding effort makes a lot of sense and would attract external support,” he said. “People want to go back home and return to lives of self-sufficiency.”Also on HuffPost:"
15,THE WORLDPOST,How Cheap Oil Handicaps Nigeria's Fight Against Boko Haram,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oil-nigeria-boko-haram_us_56be78c7e4b08ffac1256afe,"The crisis for Africa's biggest economy ""could not have come at a worse time.""",2016-02-13,"The economic crisis comes as Nigeria reels from continuing Boko Haram attacks, which have displaced some two million Nigerians. Children hide from sun at an internally displaced person's camp in Maiduguri on Feb. 4, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56be7cbf1800006f0080be73.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, we bring you one overlooked aspect of stories that made news in recent days. Did you notice the media forgot all about another story's basic facts? Tweet @TheWorldPost or let us know on our Facebook page.The crash in global oil prices has pushed Nigeria -- Africa’s biggest economy -- into economic crisis, with potentially dangerous implications for civilians vulnerable to attack by militant group Boko Haram.The price of U.S. crude oil has plummeted by 75 percent since mid-2014. That’s a disaster for Nigeria, which depends on revenue from its oil production to fund about three-fourths of the government’s budget.Nigeria’s oil revenues have fallen dramatically, and the country's currency, the naira, has dropped 50 percent in value on the black market. The country expects to run a record deficit in 2016 -- around $15 billion. President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration is seeking to borrow some $9 billion to plug the budget shortfall.The economy is far from the only crisis on the government’s plate. The Boko Haram insurgency has raged for over six years in the northeast and has left at least 30,000 dead. While Nigeria’s military has recaptured territory from Boko Haram in the past year, the extremist group continues to sow carnage across northeast Nigeria, including recent attacks on a village and camp for displaced people that killed over 100 Nigerians.“These oil prices could not have come at a worse time,” said J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center.For one thing, Nigeria is trying to train and equip an under-resourced army used mostly for international peacekeeping missions to become a fighting force capable of engaging the Boko Haram insurgency. Nigeria has increased military spending over the past decade -- the total security budget reached almost $6 billion in 2015. But that’s barely making up for years of underinvestment that had been designed to discourage military coups and to minimize losses to corruption, Pham said. For example, Nigeria’s former national security adviser is accused of stealing $2 billion from the security budget.Nigeria’s military needs more investment, as well as better management of its resources, said Raymond Gilpin, dean of the National Defense University’s Africa Center for Strategic Studies. Nigeria doesn’t release a breakdown of its security budget, and some military spending remains opaque. “There’s no use having all the latest military toys, but not a motivated and capable workforce” Gilpin said.Falling oil prices also have affected Nigeria’s neighbors -- Niger, Chad and Cameroon -- and may be hurting the region's efforts to form a coordinated response to Boko Haram. The militant group operates in the remote border zone between these countries, slipping across porous frontiers when under attack. Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, plus Benin, formed a multinational joint task force to cooperate against the group. Since Buhari’s election last March, the president has tried to revitalize the initiative, and the five countries have agreed to contribute to a 8,700-strong force to take on Boko Haram.

16,POLITICS,The U.S. Might Be Getting Closer To Expanding Its ISIS Fight,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-isis-libya_us_56be5310e4b08ffac1255c07,"Once Libyans can agree on a united government, they're expected to ask for international help to remove ISIS from their country.",2016-02-13,An oil storage tank set ablaze after ISIS tried to capture oil export facilities in Libya in January.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56be68bc1800002d0080be6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A deal to establish a central unified government in Libya may be reached by early next week, paving the way for the country to ask the U.S. and other international powers to act against the so-called Islamic State's presence there, according to a top official from the country hosting the Libyan peace talks.Mbarka Bouaida, Morocco's minister-delegate for foreign affairs, made the prediction in an exclusive interview this week with The Huffington Post.""We try as much as we can, as far as we can as Moroccans, to make a deal between them to find a solution,"" Bouaida said Wednesday. ""We're still optimistic on this point. We think we can find a good deal, and they can maybe by the end of this week or early next week, find a solution to fix their government.""The minister predicted that if the warring factions in Libya do achieve that kind of settlement, they will ask for help from Washington to tackle ISIS.""I don't think they can do it by themselves,"" Bouaida said. ""It will be very difficult. But let them come and ask for it. They know each other better than we do and it's a question of tribes and internal regions, internal fighting, but we need them to tell us exactly what they want us to do with them.""American officials have been indicating since late January that they are concerned about the Islamic State organization, also known as ISIS or Daesh, becoming stronger in war-torn Libya. Brett McGurk, the Obama administration's envoy to the global coalition against ISIS, told Congress this week that ISIS's affiliate in Libya is the most worrying affiliate of the group beyond its hub in Iraq and Syria. The radical militant group has governed Sirte, an important city on Libya's Mediterranean coast, since last year, and it may have up to 6,500 fighters in the country, U.S. officials told CNN early this month.ISIS's increasing power could spell trouble for thousands of Libyans, send even more refugees into Europe and threaten the strategically important oil reserves thus far maintained secure as the rest of Libya has descended into conflict.The Obama administration has already been slowly targeting ISIS in Libya. Last November, the Pentagon said an American military airstrike killed the group's former leader there. Recently, U.S. and British special operations teams have run more frequent missions into Libya to learn more about the group's operations, the New York Times revealed Feb. 5.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Politico on Tuesday that the U.S. is “on the verge of taking action” against ISIS in Libya.Bouaida said the chief reason there hasn't been broader action against the group in Libya yet is that international powers lack a clear parter to coordinate with there.""The matter of fighting against ISIL has become very urgent in Libya,"" the Moroccan minister told HuffPost, using the Obama administration's preferred term for the Islamic State. ""This is why it's important to finalize this agreement based on peace talks. And then the second next step will to be sit with the Libyan government, the international community and the Libyan government, to see how we could fight all together against ISIS.""Two rival governments have been clashing in Libya since 2014 -- creating confusion that allowed ISIS to thrive there and pick up support among extremists, some linked to al Qaeda, who have long had a presence in the vast North African state.The internationally recognized parliament is based in the town of Tobruk in the country's east, and is supported by armed forces calling themselves Operation Dignity. In the west, a rival assembly composed primarily of Islamists is based in the capitol of Tripoli, where Libya's main state institutions are still functioning, and is allied with a militia called Libya Dawn. Both sides oppose ISIS, which would not allow either to control the country.Yet they have been unable to agree on a unified government, in part because rival militias face pressure from their international backers -- the UAE and Egypt on the Dignity-Tobruk side, and Qatar and Turkey on the Dawn-Tripoli side.These outside powers are U.S. partners who swooped in to support proxies vying for control since a 2011 NATO intervention toppled the government of Libyan strongman Muammar Qaddafi.The Huffington Post revealed last year that Obama told the UAE and Qatar, the primary players, to end their proxy war. The president secured a commitment from them during a May summit in Washington to resolve their differences, giving a boost to United Nations-led Libya peace talks.But fears about interference persisted, peaking when it emerged in November that the outgoing UN envoy had accepted a lucrative job in the UAE.Still, the two sides signed a deal for the formation of a united government in the Moroccan town Skhirat in December.Bouaida noted that the UAE and Qatar had endorsed the agreement.But it has since appeared shaky. The UAE-linked parliament voted down the administration that mediators proposed in January over how it treated the country's security apparatus. Many of its members would like to see military matters handled by Gen. Khalifa Haftar, the controversial leader of the Dignity militia and a staunch opponent of any Islamists, including those in the rival government.Bouaida, the Moroccan minister, said that dispute is the current focus of the talks, and noted that another complaint the Tobruk government raised -- the planned government being too large -- had already been addressed.""Today, they are still [in Morocco] working on this issue and trying to find a solution,"" she added. ""We believe that they will find a solution since they all agree on the reduction on the number of members of government. There is one main issue where they are still stuck, in the security issue ... obviously, they don't have the same point of view on that and they cannot agree on one person to be in charge of the defense and security matters.""Hinting that the final resolution could not be accomplished in the current polarized environment in Libya, the minister added that the U.S. could ""try to convince all foreigners"" not to interfere in Libya. ""The ideal solution"" to the country's problems, she said, will have to be found by Libyans."

You might think they could, though, after reading multiple headlines in the British media this week celebrating Fernie, an educational assistance dog who helps out in the classroom at Winford Primary School in the city of Bristol, southwest England.The claim is based on the dog’s apparent ability to respond to commands written on flash cards, as demonstrated in this video:But the claim that Fernie is actually reading seems more than a little far-fetched. Andrea Kilkenny, professional dog trainer and owner of New Jersey pet training company Our Gang Pet Services, said the video provides good clues to what’s really going on. “It looks to me like the dog is being cued with subtle body movements,” she told The Huffington Post in an email. “He is not reading the words on the cards. The owner has created very subtle body cues to signal to the dog which behavior to perform. Note, for example, when he holds the ‘down’ cue card, the handler leans slightly forward -- this is the signal the dog is cueing off of. When he holds up the 'Roll Over' cue card up, he leans forward slightly and then leans/nods to his left and the dog rolls over in response.“Rosie Barclay, a clinical animal behaviorist of the Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors, gave a similar assessment to The Telegraph.Winford Primary school did not respond to a request for comment from HuffPost about the dog. But even though Fernie might not be perusing War and Peace anytime soon, Kilkenny was impressed with the pup, her trainer, and the way that the pooch's presence helps out kids in the classroom.“Nice training on the part of the owner, and he's found a way to pair with flash cards for the children's benefit,” she said.The chocolate lab is part of a national program called Dogs Helping Kids. Responding to the flash cards is only small part of his duties.“We find he has a very positive effect on children's learning,” Nik Gardner, headmaster and Fernie’s trainer, told the Telegraph. ""For example, after he sits with pupils to listen to them read - which the children love, because they don't feel 'judged' - they get to do some training with him and reward him with a treat.”Fernie is also more than happy to cuddle with kids who might get nervous or anxious during the day.What a good boy!Also on HuffPost:"

In Jellybean’s case, that means she flops over when she walks.But Jellybean, who’s somewhere between 15-20 weeks old, doesn’t let that get in the way of a good time.“She’s an incredibly happy animal,” Samantha Brody, development manager at Social Tees Animal Rescue -- the New York City nonprofit currently caring for Jellybean -- told The Huffington Post. “She wants to play constantly, chasing after toys, strings… She really wants nothing more than to be in your lap.”Brody, who noted that Social Tees has rescued several other cats with the condition, explained that many CH cats have normal lifespans and can live full, happy lives.“You might expect an animal with a condition like that to be somehow unhappy or grouchy or antisocial,” she said.But not Jellybean, who Brody said not only loves human affection, but also enjoys being around other cats and dogs.Right now, the little black cat is in the care of a foster home, but she’s looking for someone to adopt her permanently. But while Jellybean is well-adjusted and easy to get along with, her condition will require a couple of special measures.“Since she flops around a lot, [there should be] some kind of carpeting,” Brody said. The family should also essentially “baby proof” their home, covering up any sharp corners, she added.Ideally, Social Tees would like to see Jellybean go to a family who has some experience with CH cats, though that’s not totally necessary as long as the adopter is ready and willing to learn.Since Jellybean is so social, other big pluses would be a home where a person was home a good portion of the time, and a home with other -- cat-friendly -- animals.Brody said Social Tees would consider homes located out of New York City, but those applicants would have to agree to a home-check from a rescue group local to them, and be willing to come meet Jellybean in person at the premises.That said, if Jellybean isn’t the right cat for you, the group has many other great pets up for adoption, and your local shelter almost certainly does too.Anyone with serious interest in adopting Jellybean — or another Social Tees animal — should email contact@socialteesnyc.org for an application.Also on HuffPost:"

Now, they're using that medium to give the world a look at another issue with which the country struggles: the acceptance of its LGBT community. Yousef and Farhad tells the story of two young men struggling to gain acceptance from the people around them and to learn how to navigate life in a country that doesn't support their love. The WorldPost is publishing the comic, which is a collaboration with LGBT rights group OutRight Action International, in a four-part series this month.For Soltani and Bendib, Yousef and Farhad is more than just another graphic novel. They’ve taken what they learned with Zahra’s Paradise to try to connect with an online global audience -- but also to join a larger conversation about human interaction, freedom and what it means to love. ""Language is very crucial in how we see and relate to each other,"" Soltani told The WorldPost. ""And Iran has become a place where, in the name of orthodoxy, [people in power] generate a language of hatred and enmity where you’re either a heretic or an infidel or a spy or an apostate, an enemy against God.""To combat this, he said, you have to use language as well. Labeling people begins the process of dehumanizing them, said Soltani, who left Iran when he was young.And that’s where his writing comes in.""There’s certain key words, like 'terrorist' or 'gay' or 'faggot' or 'animal' or 'apostate,' 'heretic' -- all of these words, they are such hateful instruments, and they can cause such extraordinary damage, that I think the ultimate goal for me as a writer is to take the venom and the force and the power and authority out of these words,"" he said.""And it’s not just happening with gays,"" he explained. ""It’s happening with the Baha’i, it’s happening with secular Iranians, it’s happening with religious clerics -- it’s a question of power. I think as artists we can submerge it, we can challenge it. So that’s why we agreed to do this project.""Bendib’s inspirations are similar. The graphic novel, he said, allows him to show the controversies in Iran and embrace the challenges they present. ""This is the most unadulterated, directly unabashedly narrative form,"" he said.The positive responses to Zahra’s Paradise inspired Bendib to continue illustrating complex social topics.""Wherever we went, France or Brazil or Italy, or Turkey or wherever, we’d have people com[ing] up to us and thanking us: 'Thanks to you, I was able to understand what goes on there because I don’t really read books on this topic, I don’t like to read newspapers. Television doesn’t do it either,'"" he said. ""They felt that this particular medium was perfect. It was such a heavy, complicated theme,"" he continued. ""But having the help of the images really made the difference, especially for young people.""So Soltani and Bendib welcomed the task of telling a gay love story that takes place somewhere where openly acknowledging an LGBT identity can land someone in prison and where gender reassignment surgery is presented as a ""solution"" because some people erroneously believe being gay means you're ""trapped"" in the ""wrong"" body.The graphic novel examines the question of how people in Iran think of homosexuality compared to other ""criminal"" acts. In the beginning of Yousef and Farhad, for example, one character asks another why he is distressed about his son. She asks a series of questions to determine what the son could have done: Did he commit murder? Steal? The other man says no each time, indicating that his son did something worse.""I think it’s very important for the Iranian people to be able to claim … our right to define who we are and our right to put limits on others’ ability to infringe on our freedoms,"" Soltani said. ""And when they attack your identity or sexuality or morality, when you’re constantly put on the defensive, that’s wrong. I think [the Islamic republic] should be on the defensive, not the Iranian people.""He believes his work with Bendib is representative of a larger movement in the country.""It’s not just gays that are doing this,"" he said. ""Iranian women are doing it. Everyone in Iran is in one way or another trying to place limits on the state’s ability to control both the public and the private sphere.""""The obscenity is not that of the Iranian people,"" he said. ""The obscenity is the Islamic republic. What’s obscene is killing people’s kids and then burying them and denying people the right to have proper funerals. Talk about violating the basics of Islamic religious belief.""Highlighting conflict is partly why Bendib finds the project so important.  ""One of our major motivations was putting a human face on an entire culture, which tends to be defined by a lot of stereotypes and negative impressions,"" he said. ""So we’re trying to bring to life real people and showing how they’re flawed like everybody else. They’re certainly not perfect, but they’re certainly not any more evil, devious than you or me.""Soltani agrees, and said he hopes stories like Yousef and Farhad can help change that narrative. ""Many parents of gay kids have been so homophobic until they discover that their kid is gay. And then they’re stuck between what they learned and what their beliefs are on the one hand, and what their love is on the other,"" he said. ""And for us, I think it’s just coming back to this idea that love is what matters. Love and acceptance and tolerance.""Bendib, who is Algerian, said the Iranian revolution shows there is hope for the country. Soltani also said he is optimistic about the future of Iran. For him, the storytelling, activism and online campaigns boil down to one thing: love.""Iran [is] not a culture about hate and enmity,"" he said. ""It’s a culture about love and unity. It’s not a culture that’s about East nor West, it’s a culture that’s about both the East and the West. … Iran belongs to all of us, and in some ways, it’s what’s best in us.""Whether they're highlighting the atrocities that go on in a prison, the restrictions on women or the suppression of LGBT people, these two artists show they care about what it means when humans are forced to hide identity, to hide love. And they recognize that it doesn't have to be that way.""When you write, you’re trying to imagine,"" Soltani said. ""You’re fighting for that Iran that maybe we’ve lost. … The Iran of all the poets. The Iran of my childhood. I guess I’m trying to reclaim a little bit of that. It’s still here, even though it’s in exile. It’s in exile, but it still has a voice.""The WorldPost is publishing Yousef and Farhad over the next four weeks. Also on The WorldPost: "

""But having the help of the images really made the difference, especially for young people.""So Soltani and Bendib welcomed the task of telling a gay love story that takes place somewhere where openly acknowledging an LGBT identity can land someone in prison and where gender reassignment surgery is presented as a ""solution"" because some people erroneously believe being gay means you're ""trapped"" in the ""wrong"" body.The graphic novel examines the question of how people in Iran think of homosexuality compared to other ""criminal"" acts. In the beginning of Yousef and Farhad, for example, one character asks another why he is distressed about his son. She asks a series of questions to determine what the son could have done: Did he commit murder? Steal? The other man says no each time, indicating that his son did something worse.""I think it’s very important for the Iranian people to be able to claim … our right to define who we are and our right to put limits on others’ ability to infringe on our freedoms,"" Soltani said. ""And when they attack your identity or sexuality or morality, when you’re constantly put on the defensive, that’s wrong. I think [the Islamic republic] should be on the defensive, not the Iranian people.""He believes his work with Bendib is representative of a larger movement in the country.""It’s not just gays that are doing this,"" he said. ""Iranian women are doing it. Everyone in Iran is in one way or another trying to place limits on the state’s ability to control both the public and the private sphere.""""The obscenity is not that of the Iranian people,"" he said. ""The obscenity is the Islamic republic. What’s obscene is killing people’s kids and then burying them and denying people the right to have proper funerals. Talk about violating the basics of Islamic religious belief.""Highlighting conflict is partly why Bendib finds the project so important.  ""One of our major motivations was putting a human face on an entire culture, which tends to be defined by a lot of stereotypes and negative impressions,"" he said. ""So we’re trying to bring to life real people and showing how they’re flawed like everybody else. They’re certainly not perfect, but they’re certainly not any more evil, devious than you or me.""Soltani agrees, and said he hopes stories like Yousef and Farhad can help change that narrative. ""Many parents of gay kids have been so homophobic until they discover that their kid is gay. And then they’re stuck between what they learned and what their beliefs are on the one hand, and what their love is on the other,"" he said. ""And for us, I think it’s just coming back to this idea that love is what matters. Love and acceptance and tolerance.""Bendib, who is Algerian, said the Iranian revolution shows there is hope for the country. Soltani also said he is optimistic about the future of Iran. For him, the storytelling, activism and online campaigns boil down to one thing: love.""Iran [is] not a culture about hate and enmity,"" he said. ""It’s a culture about love and unity. It’s not a culture that’s about East nor West, it’s a culture that’s about both the East and the West. … Iran belongs to all of us, and in some ways, it’s what’s best in us.""Whether they're highlighting the atrocities that go on in a prison, the restrictions on women or the suppression of LGBT people, these two artists show they care about what it means when humans are forced to hide identity, to hide love. And they recognize that it doesn't have to be that way.""When you write, you’re trying to imagine,"" Soltani said. ""You’re fighting for that Iran that maybe we’ve lost. … The Iran of all the poets. The Iran of my childhood. I guess I’m trying to reclaim a little bit of that. It’s still here, even though it’s in exile. It’s in exile, but it still has a voice.""The WorldPost is publishing Yousef and Farhad over the next four weeks. Also on The WorldPost: "

In this edition, we speak with Robert Fatton Jr., a political scientist at the University of Virginia, about Haiti's efforts to rebuild in a time of political crisis.Haiti's controversial president, Michel Martelly, agreed to step down on Feb. 7 amid grisly protests demanding his resignation. The celebrity-musician-turned-president, also known as ""Sweet Micky,"" was elected in 2011 as the Caribbean nation reeled from a deadly earthquake. Despite his lack of political experience, Martelly vowed to rebuild the country. His legacy, however, is one of turmoil and instability. He faced accusations of corruption and bribery, and twice postponed votes to elect his successor.With Martelly's resignation, Haiti's fragile democracy has returned to a state of uncertainty. Members of the Haitian National Assembly will choose a provisional leader on Sunday, but a new president won't be elected until April 24. Prime Minister Evans Paul will maintain limited power until an interim government is established. The power vacuum comes at a time when Haiti is facing tremendous challenges. It remains the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with three-quarters of the population living on less than $2 per day. The catastrophic earthquake that devastated the nation in 2010 left hundreds of thousands of Haitians dead or injured and forced some 1.3 million to leave their homes.Efforts to restore the crippled country have been thwarted by new disasters. The world's largest cholera outbreak in recent history has claimed thousands of Haitian lives, while a three-year drought is starving millions more.The WorldPost spoke to Robert Fatton Jr., a political scientist at the University of Virginia who has studied Haitian politics for two decades, about Haiti's efforts to rebuild in a time of political crisis.The deal for President Michel Martelly to leave office has been credited with averting worse violence. Do you think it was an important move for Haiti? I don't think the deal has resolved all the issues. My personal feeling is that the deal managed to do two things. One is to compel Mr. Martelly to exit power, which is quite important given the configuration of the political system at this moment. The other thing is that the electoral council, which was a real problem, has also disappeared.So those two things have been done, but the problems aren't going to stop right now. The departure of Mr. Martelly does not resolve the Haitian crisis. There is serious doubt about the procedures that are currently being discussed about the nomination and ultimately election of a provisional president. The National Assembly doesn't agree with the procedures that were agreed upon with the agreement.So you have a series of serious problems. Who's going to be the next president? Who's going to be the next prime minister? All of that is supposed to be done on a consensus basis, but there is no consensus. The consensus has to be created, so we are back, to some extent, to the very situation that led to the crisis, minus the presence of President Martelly.I don't think the deal has resolved some of the key questions. Are we going to have a second round? What would be the substance of that second round? Are the results that were so contested going to be accepted? That's not clear at all.It may well be that the commission which is supposed to look into the results of the second round and the first election also, could come up and say, ""Well, these elections are so bad that they should be cancelled."" If that is the case, we don't know where we are going in Haiti, because you would need a completely new set of rules and new presidential candidates. It's a very fluid situation, and uncertainty is the only thing we know for sure. What are the risks for the country's fragile democracy in the 'power vacuum' that Martelly left behind?The situation is very much like it was before. I don't exactly know what will happen. There is a power vacuum, but President Martelly was president for five years, and we never had elections.This has been a crisis that has been growing for a long time. It is clear that since you do not have any real legitimate authority in the country, the crisis could escalate. There is no president, and the National Assembly itself is a problematic assembly because while it is criticizing the presidential elections, the Assembly is the product of those very elections that were supposedly so bad.You have a very delicate situation and the political system is in the process of being completely reconfigured. Old alliances may disappear [and] new alliances may reappear. The opposition was united to a large degree on one thing: the departure of Mr. Martelly, and the elimination as it were of the electoral council. That is done. Now the question is: do they have any degree of unity given the current situation? That's extremely difficult to tell at the moment.Haiti faces a severe food crisis. Are you concerned about the humanitarian impact of the current political issues?It can't help, obviously. There's a food security emergency, which tells you that the country has not really dealt with its agricultural problem at all. That's an issue that has been exacerbated by the current crisis. [On Thursday] there was a significant rain in the northeast of the country. It is flooded, and it's clear that the government can't do much about it because there is a paralysis at the top.The National Assembly has requested that [the] prime minister do something about it, but the prime minister is very worried that he could step out of the agreement and be perceived as being too involved in the day-to-day management of Haitian politics. The food crisis is going to be exacerbated, but it has a very long history.To a large degree, the food crisis is the product of certain policies that were implemented in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the complete lifting of tariffs, for instance, on the production of rice, which contributed to a real disaster. [Haiti] used to be more or less independent in terms of its food production, in particular, rice, which is so fundamental to the Haitian diet. Well, that is no longer the case. The new policies that have been implemented have really undermined food production. What are the main factors behind the country's struggles to establish a functioning democracy in the three decades since the dictatorship of Jean-Claude Duvalier?First there is the nature of the political system itself, that is the political class. Secondly, there is the significant resistance of the traditional economic elite in Haiti, who control to some extent the financial banking sector. They are totally reluctant to see any fundamental change in the distribution of power and the distribution of wealth.You have this bloc that is very much opposed to any fundamental transformation of the Haitian economy or Haitian political system. Whether you're on the left or on the right in the political class, there is that reality of taking power, and as we say in Haiti, of eating power, and growing fat on power, at the expense of the general population.Then you have the international community, which has been interfering in Haitian affairs for a very, very long time, without really generating any type of positive success. The economic plans that have been elaborated are plans, in my mind, that can only contribute to the exacerbation of the political crisis. We have an open economy. What that means is that local production is literally destroyed.What we do is basically export certain things, mangoes and coffee, and whatever investments we have in the country tend to be rooted in ultra-cheap labor areas. That was the model under Duvalier. It led to an acute crisis and I don't see why this model, which is the same, would lead to anything but an acute crisis.What lessons can Haiti learn form Martelly's time in office as the country prepares to elect a new leader?The election of Mr. Martelly was very controversial. There was a first round where Mr. Martelly didn't come in the second position, and then the U.S. and the Organization of American States essentially forced the issue and compelled the then-president [René] Préval to accept some sort of a deal whereby his handpicked candidate, Jude Célestin, should step down from his second position. The election in 2010 in the first round stopped literally after five hours. All the candidates except Jude Célestin declared that the elections were so fraudulent that they should be cancelled.And yet, the international community intervened and told Mirlande Manigat and Mr. Martelly that the results would probably be such that they would be number one and number two. So after saying that the elections should be cancelled, 24 hours afterwards, both of them said, ""Oh the elections were not that bad."" And then we know the rest of the story, so that election was really farcical. What we've had in the last few months is more or less of the same vein.If you're going to have elections, do have good elections, at least that are perceived as legitimate. This is not the case. The second thing is, clearly, on the one hand, the international community, which I think has really continuously interfered in the Haitian political process with very significantly negative consequences, wants to be in solidarity with the Haitian people. That's fine, but the perception in Haiti is that when it takes charge of the electoral process itself on who should be the president of Haiti, that leads to significant problems.The other problem is the Haitian political class. It's not just the international community. The Haitian political class is totally interested in its corporate interests, period. There is such a thing as the absolute desire on the part of that political class to keep power, and not to relinquish power. That cuts across the political spectrum. It's part of the right wing and the left wing. We have a problem about the very nature of politics in Haiti.Most politicians are people coming from the middle classes, and the middle classes have been in fact disappearing in Haiti because of the economic crisis. That means that if you want to acquire some amount of wealth, politics becomes a business. Once you get in a position of power, you are not going to want to relinquish that power because it's a source of wealth -- corrupt wealth -- but nonetheless, it allows you to improve not only yourself, but also your family and extended family to improve your financial lot. What are some of the most pressing challenges Haiti's new leader will have to address upon taking office?If the elections are perceived by the vast majority of Haitians as legitimate and fair, the first thing the leader has to do is try to consolidate whatever we have in terms of institutions. Whether it's a legislative branch or an executive branch or a judicial branch, they are really in agony. There's no other way of putting it.From an economic perspective, this is where the issue of foreign economic dependence comes in. If you really want to change the nature of the Haitian system, I think that you need to concentrate on agricultural production and on food production. This is clearly not the model that the international community wants to see in Haiti. There is a real constraint on whoever becomes president of Haiti to move in that direction.The other aspect is really, how do you manage the conflicts in Haiti? Haiti is extremely poor, and there is an absolute division between a very small elite, which is doing very well, and the vast majority of Haitians, who are doing extremely poorly. How do you in some ways build the bridge between those two sectors?That is probably beyond the capacity of any one individual. It would require compromise on the part of the business community -- compromises that have never really [been] contemplated -- and that would require assistance from the international community to push the business community in that direction, which is also a very difficult thing to see.Haiti is really facing a Catch-22 situation. I'm not quite sure how to extricate the country from its predicament, but whoever [becomes] president, it's clear that that person will have a really amazingly complicated task. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

You know a great leader when you're working for one, but even they can have a hard time articulating what it is that makes their leadership so effective.It was recently rumored that Starbucks' CEO Howard Schultz would run for president, but Schultz shut the idea down almost immediately. He wrote in an article:""Despite the encouragement of others, I have no intention of entering the presidential fray. I'm not done serving at Starbucks.""Schultz commitment to his company over the temptation of the limelight is interesting. What's admirable is his desire to be a leader who serves.Service isn't just something Schulz gives lip service to in the press; his mission is to create a company where people are treated with respect and dignity, and he backs this rhetoric up with his money and time. Starbucks will spend $250 million over the next 10 years to put benefit-eligible employees through college, and Schultz wakes up every day at 4:00 a.m. to send motivational e-mails to his employees (the email he wrote yesterday asking employees to show empathy for customers who have been affected by the plummeting stock market is an interesting, recent example of this).It's through a leader's actions--what he or she does and says on a daily basis--that the essence of great leadership becomes apparent.""Dream more than others think practical. Expect more than others think possible. Care more than others think wise."" - Howard Schultz Behavior can change, and leaders who work to improve their skills get results.In Schultz's case, he's been honing his leadership craft for three decades through, among other things, the direct coaching and mentoring of leadership expert Warren Bennis at USC.Not everyone can take on Warren Bennis as a mentor, of course, but when it comes down to it, improving your leadership skills is within your control. You just need to study what great leaders do and to incorporate these behaviors into your repertoire.There are six critical things that great leaders do that really stand out. Any of us can do the same.They're kind without being weakOne of the toughest things for leaders to master is kindness. Kindness shares credit and offers enthusiastic praise for others' work. It's a balancing act, between being genuinely kind and not looking weak. The key to finding that balance is to recognize that true kindness is inherently strong--it's direct and straightforward. Telling people the difficult truth they need to hear is much kinder than protecting them (or yourself) from a difficult conversation. This is weak.True kindness also doesn't come with expectations. Kindness is weak when you use it in a self-serving manner. Self-serving kindness is thin--people can see right through it when a kind leader has an agenda. Think of Schultz, who dedicated $250 million to employee education with no strings attached, and as soon as employees finish their degree, they are free to walk out the door. That's true kindness.They're strong without being harshStrength is an important quality in a leader. People will wait to see if a leader is strong before they decide to follow his or her lead or not. People need courage in their leaders. They need someone who can make difficult decisions and watch over the good of the group. They need a leader who will stay the course when things get tough. People are far more likely to show strength themselves when their leader does the same.A lot of leaders mistake domineering, controlling, and otherwise harsh behavior for strength. They think that taking control and pushing people around will somehow inspire a loyal following. Strength isn't something you can force on people; it's something you earn by demonstrating it time and again in the face of adversity. Only then will people trust that they should follow you.They're confident, without being cockyWe gravitate to confident leaders because confidence is contagious, and it helps us to believe that there are great things in store. The trick, as a leader, is to make certain your confidence doesn't slip into arrogance and cockiness. Confidence is about passion and belief in your ability to make things happen, but when your confidence loses touch with reality, you begin to think you can do things you can't and have done things you haven't. Suddenly it's all about you. This arrogance makes you lose credibility.Great, confident leaders are still humble. They don't allow their accomplishments and position of authority to make them feel that they're better than anyone else. As such, they don't hesitate to jump in and do the dirty work when needed, and they don't ask their followers to do anything they aren't willing to do themselves.They stay positive, but remain realisticAnother major challenge that leaders face is finding the balance between keeping things positive and still being realistic. Think of a sailboat with three people aboard: a pessimist, an optimist, and a great leader. Everything is going smoothly until the wind suddenly sours. The pessimist throws his hands up and complains about the wind; the optimist sits back, saying that things will improve; but the great leaders says, ""We can do this!"" and he adjusts the sails and keeps the ship moving forward. The right combination of positivity and realism is what keeps things moving forward.They're role models, not preachersGreat leaders inspire trust and admiration through their actions, not just their words. Many leaders say that integrity is important to them, but great leaders walk their talk by demonstrating integrity every day. Harping on people all day long about the behavior you want to see has a tiny fraction of the impact you achieve by demonstrating that behavior yourself.  They're willing to take a bullet for their peopleThe best leaders will do anything for their teams, and they have their people's backs no matter what. They don't try to shift blame, and they don't avoid shame when they fail. They're never afraid to say, ""The buck stops here,"" and they earn people's trust by backing them up. Great leaders also make it clear that they welcome challenges, criticism, and viewpoints other than their own. They know that an environment where people are afraid to speak up, offer insights, and ask good questions is destined for failure.Bringing It All TogetherGreat leadership is dynamic; it melds a variety of unique skills into an integrated whole. Incorporate the behaviors above into your repertoire, and you'll see immediate improvement in your leadership skills.What other behaviors define great leadership?

But I disagree.How do I know? I was in the car today with my 13 year-old son and his friend. And the whole time they were talking about politics. Not just about the candidates, but about the issues -- about immigration, energy policy, ISIS.And it made me think that whatever our opinions of the candidates -- whatever we think of Trump or Cruz or Sanders -- whatever we think is wrong about our political system, we should all at least feel good that there is very little apathy in this campaign, and that it's bringing even young adolescents into the political conversation. And their engagement isn't coming just in class when it's the assigned topic of conversation, but when they can choose to talk about anything they want. Instead of talking about video games and sports, they're talking about immigration and energy policy.  And that's very good news -- not just about the campaigns but about our country and about our future. It's a great countervailing truth to the conventional wisdom that everything about our country is wrong right now. Because 13-year-olds talking about politics and talking about issues is f*cking great."

I'm one of them. It took me months to be able to breathe normally after my divorce. My trust and self-confidence took years to return.As women, divorce changes us in fundamental ways. In the beginning, it amplifies our insecurities. Longer-term, it can be an opportunity for growth and happiness.At the end of the painful process, a new woman emerges.

28,FIFTY,How I Really Feel About Turning 75,"Joan Gage, ContributorA Rolling Crone",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turning-75_b_9168284.html,"I woke up yesterday morning feeling vaguely depressed, but until my husband Nick wished me 'happy birthday', I didn't realize this was the day I turn 75-years-old.

I think I was dreading this birthday partly because my mother died at 74. (Her birthday was Feb. 3, 1911, mine is Feb. 4, 1941.) My mother died of congestive heart failure and actually outlived her doctors' predictions by about a year.So I drank my morning coffee and tried to sort out the jumble of thoughts and emotions. This 75th birthday, so close to the beginning of a new year, was definitely for me a liminal experience, as daughter Eleni would call it. (""Limen"" means threshold in Latin.) Eleni studied anthropology in college and in her blog, ""The Liminal Stage"". she explains: ""Liminal stages are psychological thresholds, times of transition when we stand 'betwixt and between' one state and another. The biggies are birth, marriage, death -- cultures develop splashy rituals around these transitions to ease the anxiety they provoke.""You can guess which liminal stage I was contemplating. In fact, I've been talking so much about death in recent months that my kids and husband keep razzing me about it. I've sent them memos about what I want and don't want at my funeral. (No open coffin, in fact no body or casket. Funeral service for immediate family only. Some time later a party/open house/memorial service with no eulogies, only extemporaneous anecdotes with lots of food, wine and music. I've already worked out the entire mix of songs I want -- heavy on Led Zeppelin and Queen.) Before her death, my mother, the world's most organized person, had written down the hymns and scripture readings for her funeral, specified cremation, and purchased the mausoleum niche where her ashes, and my father's, would be stowed in brass boxes that resemble books. She chose a niche which had a view of the swans on the cemetery's pond. She had all their financial affairs in order, filed neatly in her desk when she died.My father, on the other hand, had dementia as well as Parkinson's disease until he died at 80, so he didn't even known when my mother died. His dementia first became evident at our parents' 50th wedding anniversary in 1982, when he was about 76. Needless to say, I've been watching myself for signs of Alzheimer's, and avidly doing Lumosity ""brain games"" every day. (Daughter Marina kindly signed me up, knowing my worry about memory loss.) I realize, as recent articles have pointed out, that Lumosity doesn't really help you stave off dementia. It just measures how you become better at the games with practice. But nevertheless, it gave me comfort that yesterday's workout results put me at 91.3 percent LPI -- whatever that is -- as compared with my age group, and 97.3 percent for ""problem solving"" (but only 81.9 percent for memory). I was happy that my numbers had gone up, but then I realized that, overnight, the age group I was being compared to had changed from ""age 70 to 74"" to ""over 75."" Less competition!For the past 50 years or so I've been making pretty much the same New Year's resolutions as everyone else: Lose 10 pounds, go to the gym (or Pilates) twice a week, publish a book with my own name on it, learn Spanish (so I can communicate better with my bilingual grandchildren). This year my New Year's resolutions changed. I'm no longer interested in improving my weight, career, or possessions (but still want to learn Spanish). All my resolutions can be collected under the theme: GET RID OF STUFF. I am a hoarder, as my family will attest. I even bought the best seller ""The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up"" by Marie Kondo, but after reading several chapters I had to stop, because it was making me feel so guilty. Now I'm going to target certain areas -- my studio, my computer desk, my make-up area, the library and especially my closets -- one at a time. Tons of papers have to go. All those books I'll never read again will be donated to the Grafton library for sale. All my office-appropriate clothes will go to ""Dress for Success"" so that other, younger women can find jobs. I've told the kids, whatever they want, take it now, (in hopes of avoiding, as among my mother's nine siblings, bitter schisms between two children who want the same antique bureau).As the day of my 75th birthday moved from morose reflections over coffee to astonishment at the sight of over 200 birthday wishes on the Internet, I alternated between tears (over the card my husband gave me) and laughter (for instance when daughter Eleni posted on Facebook: ""Did you know that on her 60th birthday I witnessed this woman sip from a hash milkshake in Amsterdam? Trust me, she was in it for the milkshake. Happy Birthday, Party Girl!)"" I was delighted to receive calls and gifts from son Chris and daughter Marina, both on the opposite side of the country, and chuckled at the books Marina sent: ""The Alzheimer' Prevention Program"", ""Keep Your Brain Alive"" and ""41 Uses For a Grandma"" among them.""At the end of the day, at dinner in the romantic restaurant Casa Tua in South Beach, FL, Nick and I told each other how lucky we are that we've made it through 45 years of marriage, that we have three great kids and two extraordinary grandchildren, and that when we get up in the morning, no parts of our bodies hurt. That's a rare blessing when your age group is ""over 75."" So by the time the waiter brought a birthday crème brulée with a candle in it, (as well as a ""chocolate meltdown"" -- both surprises ordered by daughter Eleni) -- I felt ready to cross the threshold into the next liminal stage, whatever it brings.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Orange County has long opposed needle exchanges, despite decades of evidence demonstrating that these programs save lives and prevent the spread of infectious disease.",2016-02-13,"People abusing drugs, with African american man and caucasian guy sharing the same syringe to inject heroin",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1e3cc200000e500ffc89c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last Thursday, the California Department of Public Health approved the first ever needle exchange in Orange County — a major victory for public health and safety. Orange County has long opposed needle exchanges, despite decades of evidence demonstrating that these programs save lives and prevent the spread of infectious disease. However, due to the hard work of a team of community members and medical students, the Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) will open on February 20.What are needle exchanges, and why are they important? Most simply, needle exchanges are public health programs where people who inject drugs can safely dispose of their used syringes and obtain clean injection supplies. In the United States, millions of people inject drugs every year. Many of them are denied access to the most basic social services, including housing and addiction treatment. Even more face violence, stigma, homelessness, and disease. In this setting, needle exchanges are one of the only places where injection drug users are reliably treated with kindness, dignity, and respect. Needle exchanges are known to reduce hepatitis C rates by up to 65% and HIV rates by up to 33%. Opponents argue that needle exchanges facilitate illegal drug use, but in fact they have been proven to decrease drug use and connect users to the services they often desperately need. By providing a safe place to dispose of syringes, needle exchanges protect communities by reducing the number of syringes found in public areas, such as parks or in the street. Not a single scientific study has demonstrated that needle exchange programs yield negative consequences.Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting needle exchanges, current regulations mean that establishing a program is incredibly difficult. 64% of California counties lack even one needle exchange, even though they are cheap, easy to administer, and require no technical staff. Supporters of OCNEP — the recently approved Orange County needle exchange — include academic faculty, law enforcement, physicians, businesses, the California and Orange County Medical Associations, public health experts, and some of the largest HIV prevention organizations in the United States. Yet implementation took 17 months of struggling against unjustified threats of arrest, multiple and contradictory demands that the program change locations, endless red tape even after demonstrating levels of community support unheard of for other public health programs, excessive fundraising requirements, and other major obstacles. This meant 17 months of new HIV cases; 17 months of unnecessary overdoses; 17 months of Orange County failing its most vulnerable citizens.Needle exchanges are simple. They are safe, proven to work, and cost almost nothing. By approving a needle exchange program for the first time in its history, the California Department of Public Health has taken a brave step forward. But that step isn't enough. Government officials and public health authorities must not just regulate, but actively facilitate, the development of new needle exchanges. They must streamline the approval process, which required thousands of hours of organizing and multiple rounds of applications to establish even a bare-bones program. Although unwritten, the de facto requirements impose near-impossible hurdles for the majority of people interested in starting a program. Instead of these barriers, public health departments should provide early and frequent assistance to community organizers who want to build needle exchanges in regions that currently lack them, thereby ensuring that their efforts build sustainable, successful programs. Promoting community leadership in this way would guarantee the health of everyone, not just those who live in well-funded areas with well-networked organizers.Everyone can contribute to this mission. If you want to support public health and drug policy reform efforts in your community, volunteer with your local needle exchange program. If you are in Orange County, join the team at OCNEP. The program is entirely volunteer run and democratically organized. If your county doesn't currently have a program, or enough programs to serve the population, consider starting one. If you need help, contact us — we would love to support your efforts. And if you are a healthcare professional, ensure that your patients are aware of local harm reduction services, including needle exchange programs.OCNEP's approval has implications that reach far beyond California, as it demonstrates that with dedicated activism, community health efforts can overcome misinformation, stigma, and fear — even in one of the most conservative places in the world. There is a grave need for the expansion of needle exchange services. Needle exchanges respect the dignity and worth of their clients, protect the health and safety of their communities, and do so without any known downsides. Successfully establishing a program in Orange County is something to celebrate, but it is only part of a much larger and longer effort to make harm reduction services available to anyone who needs them. Barriers to establishing needle exchanges must come down. More people must stand up for the rights of themselves and their loved ones by launching programs where none presently exist. In this mission, the path is lit ahead — we hope you join us in walking down it."

In a dramatic response to Europe's gravest refugee crisis since World War II, NATO ordered three warships to sail immediately Thursday to the Aegean Sea to help end the deadly smuggling of asylum-seekers across the waters from Turkey to Greece.

Waiting to cross another border. Waiting for a smuggler to call back to to say if there is room on the rubber dinghy, or worse, if they will have to sail it. Waiting to be rescued in the middle of the sea. Waiting to die ... of starvation.At train stations across Europe, they're waiting. On bridges, they're waiting. At borders, they are waiting. In forests, in the pouring rain, on the side of highways, they're waiting.Today, more than 40,000 Syrians are waiting at the Bab al-Salameh border crossing with Turkey after escaping a brutal onslaught by Assad's army shielded by Russian air strikes in Aleppo. The lucky ones sleep in mosques, most sleep outdoors, many without tents even as temperatures drop below zero at night. Already this week, a three-year-old child and an older man froze to death.And while they are waiting, they're praying for an end to the war that is dividing families; forcing millions to run for their lives; turning people into expendable pawns, all while revealing how deeply divided the world is.Turkey, which already hosts more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, more than any other country, and has pledged that it ""will not close the doors"" on refugees, has nonetheless closed the Salameh border gate citing security concerns and a belief that admitting more refugees is tantamount to authorizing Russia's goal of kicking the rebels out of Aleppo.On the security question, Turkey said that this week it intercepted people carrying explosives and that at least four suicide vests had been found on a group of four men, 10 women and 20 children on their way through Karkamis in the south-east border with Syria. The growing perception that ISIS is using the refugee crisis to plant sleeper cells and send them across the world, is compounding the crisis, paralyzing politicians, and emboldening extremists on all sides.Meanwhile, in Syria, Russia is widening the range of the towns it is targeting. This week alone, Russian warplanes hit around 1,000 targets across the country. After 5 years of fighting that has killed one quarter of a million Syrians, Bashar Al Assad is hoping to recapture Syria's largest city. More than 500 people have been killed in just over a week. Many by Russia's heavy airstrikes. Entire villages have been emptied in Aleppo. Aid agencies say they are struggling to meet the basic needs of tens of thousands fleeing Aleppo, where supply routes have been cut off.Almost 100,000 have been displaced by the new offensive and more than 500,000 could arrive from Aleppo province in coming days according to Turkey.""With every refugee that we accept in a way, we would be contributing to this ethnic cleansing aim,"" said Turkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu.Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called it a genocide and accused the international community of hypocrisy, by asking Turkey to let the refugees in, when most countries in the world are not.Meanwhile, Turkey is also threatening to send the 2.5 million Syrian refugees already in Turkey to Europe. The EU agreed to give Turkey 3 billion in financial aid for the refugees, but two-and-a-half months after the agreement, no funds have been transferred. The Associated Press reports that Turkey has already spent $10 billion on housing refugees, compared to the UN which has spent a mere $455 million.In this vicious war, political calculations trump people's humanity. More than half of Syria's population has been displaced. Almost 5 million refugees have already fled. This summer, everyone expected the flow of refugees to decrease, but as the war rages on, winter has not stemmed the flow of refugees -- with almost 55,000 people reaching Europe by sea since the start of 2016.The EU's policy on refugees is schizophrenic at best. France, Britain and their allies at the UN Security Council on Wednesday pushed Russia to end its bombing of Aleppo. This week the EU is asking Turkey to open its border with Syria. But just a few months ago when Turkey shot down a Russian jet that they claimed violated its airspace, the EU had asked Turkey to shut down the border.This week, Saudi Arabia, a major backer of so-called rebel groups, said it was considering sending ground troops to Syria. Turkey is blaming Russia for the high civilian casualties. Iran admits to sending military advisers to Syria, though it denies sending combat troops. Even as Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has been engaged in brutal battles on the ground, having besieged Madaya for months, and prevented anyone from leaving to get food.The U.S., which has accepted just over 2,500 refugees, has also played a debilitating role, both through its action, tepidly arming certain rebel groups and inaction. Years ago, President Obama called for the removal of Assad, without any strategy or plan of action and drew red lines around the use of chemical weapons, without enforcing them. Most recently the U.S. is coordinating with both Kurdish militias, as well as Iranian forces on the ground.Meanwhile,a majority of U.S. governors (as well as the leading Republican candidate Donald Trump) have vowed to ban Syrian refugees from entering their states, and advocated for banning Syrians from entering America all together. This week, Donald Trump said in a town hall meeting that he would proudly look Syrian children in the eyes and tell them they are not welcome in the United States.In September, President Obama proposed allowing an additional 10,000 Syrian refugees to come to the U.S. over the next year. But it is up to Congress to choose whether to fund the resettlements, and they've taken steps to slow down the process. Although the U.S. has contributed the largest amount of humanitarian aid to Syria since 2011, sending more than $4 billion dollars, simply throwing money or arms at Syria is only compounding the crisis. Canada's new Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was elected to office in November, said this week that his government will end its bombing missions in Syria by February 22. ""Call us old-fashioned, but we think that we ought to avoid doing precisely what our enemies want us to do,"" he said. ""They want us to elevate them, to give in to fear, to indulge in hatred, to eye one another with suspicion and to take leave of our faculties.""Whatever our enemies may want, Syrians are still left waiting, and dying."

Rustin in the Statler Hotel at a news briefing on the Civil Rights March on Washington, DC, USA, 27 August 1963. Photographer: Warren K Leffler. (Photo by Universal History Archive/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb931f93c000020010e131c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With the primary season now finally and officially underway, and with Senator Bernie Sanders' stunning victory in New Hampshire still registering on the political seismograph, I've been wondering what Bayard Rustin would make of it all. If you aren't familiar with that name you ought to be. Rustin, who died in 1987 at the age of 75, was a central figure in the Civil Rights Movement. He was the movement's in-house intellectual and one of its tactical geniuses. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave the speech we all remember in front of the Lincoln Memorial on that August day in 1963. Rustin was the guy who organized the event.Raised among Quakers in a town outside of Philadelphia, Rustin was a pacifist and champion of non-violence. As such, he refused to serve in the army during World War II and went to prison for it. He was an opponent of the Vietnam War well before that position became mainstream. But in the Civil Rights Movement Rustin largely stayed behind the scenes because in addition to his unwavering commitment to racial justice, he was unapologetically gay at a time when ""outing"" served as a kind of blackmail. Rustin didn't much care, but others in the movement did. White supremacists and black power advocates both denounced him as a ""pervert.""Rustin was also a socialist for much of his life, and so one can imagine a really fun, lively conversation between him and Sanders. And yet, I'm not sure that Rustin would be feeling the Bern right now.In 1965, Rustin looked back on a decade of civil rights triumphs - from Brown v. Board to the Civil Rights Act, and wrote a remarkable essay for Commentary magazine titled: ""From Protest to Politics."" It is still worth reading.As the title suggests, the argument of the essay is that Civil Rights protesters created pressure to help dismantle the legal barriers to equality. Now, Rustin went on, to achieve what he called ""the fact of equality"" required turning to politics directly. ""What began as a protest movement,"" Rustin wrote, ""is being challenged to translate itself into a political movement.""Doing so, Rustin knew full well, meant forming coalitions. And coalitions meant compromise. Nothing wrong with that, Rustin argued and he drew an important distinction: ""the difference between expediency and morality in politics is the difference between selling out a principle and making smaller concessions to win larger ones."" Ever the tactician, Rustin always had the long-view in mind, and he minced no words for those who lost sight of that: ""The leader who shrinks from this task reveals not his purity but his lack of political sense.""That observation, though written 50 years ago, might well have been aimed at the Sanders phenomenon. Bernie Sanders appeals because he is both a crusader and a politician (though the same could be said of Ted Cruz too). And he has positioned himself as the singular embodiment of a wide-ranging Democratic Socialist agenda. Le Left C'est Moi!But Sanders is decidedly not the product of a protest movement now evolving into a political movement of the sort Rustin was theorizing. Sanders may be surfing the collective frustration, disgust, and perhaps even hopes of many people weary of our current political arrangements. As Rustin would be quick to remind us, however, Sanders is not leading a political movement.The debate about Sanders inside progressive circles has largely revolved around whether, should he win the Democratic nomination, he could be electable. Yes! say his supporters wishfully as much as analytically; No! say his detractors, many of whom are still hung-over from George McGovern's electoral disaster in 1972.The question misses the larger point. That Sanders will not be able to create the programs that get him the biggest applause at his rallies - free college tuition, a single-payer health system - goes without saying. So Sanders must answer the questions Rustin put on the table in 1965: what small concessions is he prepared to make in order to achieve large goals? Is ideological purity more important to him than political sense? If he can't answer those questions, then his candidacy is nothing more than symbolic.Rustin would also remind us that genuine movements, of the sort that result in lasting change, take time and require a great deal of hard-work, sacrifice and patience. Before he organized the March on Washington in 1963, Rustin worked with A. Philip Randolph to organize a march on Washington in 1941, and 15 years before the Freedom Rides you've heard about, Rustin organized the Journey of Reconciliation to challenge segregation on interstate buses.In this sense, Sanders' supporters, and maybe even the Senator himself, have conflated protest with politics. They aren't the same thing, and confusing the two makes both less effective. So the question that Sanders' supporters must answer is: if Sanders loses, are they prepared to channel their energy and anger into a long-lasting political movement? Steven Conn is the W. E.

Jim Gilmore suspended his presidential campaign on Friday.""My campaign was intended to offer the gubernatorial experience, withthe track record of a true conservative, experienced in national security, to unite the party,” Gilmore said in a press release. “My goal was to focus on the importance of this election as a real turning point, and to emphasize the dangers of continuing on a road that will further undermine America's economy and weaken our national security.""In the release, Gilmore pledged to support the eventual Republican nominee.Gilmore launched his long-shot campaign in July.Gilmore last held elected office as governor of Virginia from 1998 to 2002. Even in a crowded Republican field that had 17 candidates at its peak, he stood out for his obscurity and failure to gain traction.  His overall support among GOP voters was never higher than 0.0 percent, according to the HuffPost Pollster average of polls. Gilmore was regularly excluded from primary debates for not meeting the requisite threshold of support.The policy rationale for Gilmore's candidacy was as vague as his name recognition with the public. He ran on a platform of reversing American decline, arguing in his launch video that ""America's economic and national security is increasingly at risk.""Like other Republican candidates, he called for a more muscular U.S. foreign policy. He touted his experience as a former Army intelligence officer and made a rare public campaign stop at a Washington rally against the Iran nuclear deal in September. Unlike some of his more prominent rivals, Gilmore made a point of defending birthright citizenship, attacking Donald Trump and other Republican candidates for abandoning it to punish undocumented immigrants.This was Gilmore's second presidential run. He ran briefly for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, dropping out in July 2007.Paige Lavender contributed reporting."

The comment did not go over well, with young feminist voters expressing disappointment that Albright had missed the mark, some implicating the Clinton campaign by extension. Many female voters felt that they were being shamed into supporting Clinton simply because of her gender. During last night's Democratic presidential debate moderated by PBS' Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff (the first all-female panel to moderate a debate), Woodruff asked Clinton to comment on on Albright's now-controversial remark in the context of the presidential election. ""Your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said there's a special place in hell for women who don't support other women,"" Woodruff said. ""Do you agree with what she said?""""Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years,"" Clinton said. ""But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. That's what I've always stood for.""She added said that when it comes to important issues such as equal pay and paid family leave ""we still have some barriers to knock down."" Watch Clinton's full response below. ""I have said many times, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman,"" Clinton told the crowd. ""I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.""Earlier in the debate, Woodruff asked Clinton to respond to the fact that 55 percent of female voters supported Sanders in the recent New Hampshire primaries. ""What are women missing about you?"" Woodruff asked.""I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me,"" Clinton told Woodruff. ""I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society."" While Clinton pointed out that she's always been a strong leader for women's rights, her goal is not to pressure a woman into voting for her simply because of her gender. ""I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known,"" Clinton said. ""But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. That's what I'm working towards.""

35,POLITICS,Here's How DeRay Mckesson Plans To Change Baltimore As Mayor,Tyler Tynes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deray-mayor-platform_us_56be17c2e4b0c3c550511011,"""Here is the beginning of my plan to usher us into an era where the city lives up to its potential, where we end politics as usual,"" Mckesson says.",2016-02-12,"Deray McKesson, a prominent civil rights activist and Baltimore mayoral candidate, released his platform Friday focusing on safety, education and policing.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56be18521a00009c01ab2928.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- After jumping into the Baltimore mayoral race and raising over $77,000 in nine days, prominent civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson released pieces of his mayoral platform on Friday.Equipped with web-slanted advertisements -- created by the Democratic firm that has worked with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio -- Mckesson's plan focuses on education, youth development, safety and community prosperity. He plans to release five additional pieces of the platform in the coming weeks.""There’s no soundbite that I can give you that’s going to make this more enticing,"" Mckesson told The Huffington Post prior to releasing the platform. ""You should judge it. I believe in the platform. I think it will be a comprehensive platform.""He added that he believed it would ""be able to stand up to the test of experts.""The 30-year-old Mckesson, a former school administrator, wants to reconfigure the role Baltimore's government plays in the city's schools.He wants to expand full-day, public pre-K in order to enroll every low-income 3- and 4-year-old in the city; create literacy-rich educational environments to support children's early cognitive development; set up full academic scholarships for low-income graduates of publics schools; and promote a ""radical transformation"" of Baltimore City Community College to improve graduation rates and create a stronger curriculum.The activist is also demanding the release of internal audits from city schools, and wants to fix the public school funding formula to fill a gap in school funding that has left more than a hundred school staffers without jobs and schools with 170 vacant staff positions.For his safety measures, Mckesson linked economics and education.""For our kids to go to school they must be alive and for adults to work they must not be in jail,"" he said in the platform, emphasizing the idea that community safety transcends policing.The mayoral candidate suggests community-first responders to de-escalate conflict and prevent retaliation. Mckesson, unsurprisingly, also wants to eliminate policing methods that have killed black men nationwide -- such as illegal chokeholds like the one that killed Eric Garner in New York and the ""rough ride"" that caused the death of Charm City's own Freddie Gray. Mckesson also suggests that the city police department and courts no longer accept police officers' excuse that they resorted to violence because they believed a suspect was ""reaching for their weapon."" He calls for replacing standard firearms with smart guns, redistributing part of the Baltimore police budget to communities most affected by crime, and creating a city commission to divert drug addicts to treatment instead of jail.The community prosperity portion of Mckesson's platform focuses on economics. His main points address increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, expanding youth employment by hiring directly from neighborhoods with high drop-out rates and unemployment, and establishing transitional work opportunities for ex-convicts and impoverished citizens.""Prosperity acceleration occurs when we commit to an economic development plan that partners with our city, its residents, and is invested in the long-term success of Baltimore,"" Mckesson's plan says.The cluttered Baltimore mayoral race includes 29 candidates. Thirteen of them are Democrats looking to claim incumbent Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's soon-to-be empty seat. Mckesson's plan comes nine days after entering the race at the last possible hour, and he's only the second candidate to release a mayoral plan.Former mayor Sheila Dixon is currently the front-runner, with a January poll showing her with 27 percent of the vote. State Sen. Catherine Pugh comes in second, with just over 18 percent of the vote, according to the same poll. Carl Stokes is the only remaining candidate that polls over 10 percent, with 14.3 percent of the vote. Nick J. Mosby, a city councilman and husband to Maryland Attorney General Marilyn Mosby, released a plan in January to improve Baltimore by ""connecting the dots.""The fact that Mckesson is only the second candidate to release a wide-ranging plan based on more than one specific issue has incensed the Baltimore native.""The reality is, people, I’ve ran for what? Five days or something? And people are expecting the world. And we plan to deliver it,"" Mckesson told The Huffington Post earlier this week. ""People have been running for a year and have offered no plans, right? Literally none. And that is wild to me."" Also on HuffPost:"
