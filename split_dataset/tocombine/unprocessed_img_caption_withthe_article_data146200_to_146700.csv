So I am thrilled and nervous to be assigned by Venice Magazine to photograph Karen Black, who definitely is in my ""handful.""I enter the theater in Hollywood where she is rehearsing for her play and introduce myself. Within about two seconds, all nervousness vanishes as she magically puts me completely at ease, as if we are old friends who've known each other all our lives (and beyond). I am right away ""dear."" She takes me into her dressing area to check wardrobe options for our work together. She has a cool, smallish vintage suitcase with different things in it. I tell her how I recently did a session with a former ""supermodel"" who had a similarly-sized suitcase just chock full of clothes, much more than would appear to fit in it, and how, when the session was done, the model got everything in the suitcase, then sat on it in order to close the latches. ""Here's how you do it, dear..."" And she proceeds to give me a lesson in the fine art of packing more clothes than seems possible into a small suitcase, a combination of layering and folding that achieves its goal successfully right in front of my eyes. Then we get to work. ""What do you have in mind, dear?"" I like to find spots of light and feeling around a location, and have made some mental notes already. We move around the theater, and in each spot, she intuits the essence and poses in perfect accord to evoke the feeling of the moment and space. I don't have to speak much. ""What about this?"" she asks. ""This is your time,"" I say, ""I'm here for you... keep going, you can do no wrong!"" This proves to be an understatement...In the ensuing years, I get her email updates and am inspired by her passion and dedication to her craft. If I ever want to help aspiring actors, female or male, I will urge them to study the life and work of Karen Black, including, for reasons obvious, lovely and enduring, the fine art of packing a suitcase.info@kindsightfoundation.org www.robertzuckerman.com"

Sandow focused on people who were married or living with a partner for her research.She found that around 11 percent of the couples she studied had split by 2000, and more commuter couples separated than those who worked close to home. Fourteen percent of couples in which one or both partners commuted at least 45 minutes called it quits, while only 10 percent of non-commuter couples broke up. However, not all commuter relationships were doomed; Sandow found that people who had a lengthy commute for more than five years were only one percent more likely to divorce than non-commuter couples. And breakups were less common for those who had already been commuting long distances before the relationship began.Other recent studies that have shed light on the type of people more likely divorce found that people whose weight falls between 101 and 200 pounds are more likely to split than heavier people, and stepfathers are more likely to leave their wives than men in traditional marriages.Click through the slideshow below for even more surprising divorce findings.Keep in touch!

The party had a Fifties-style high school theme complete with cheerleaders and marching bands. (AP Photo) BEST QUALITY AVAILABLE",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d6ec42000002d00fdf6ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Allie Churchill for YourTango.comWhat's better than a date night at the movies? Try a date night inspired by some of the hottest romantic blockbusters that swept us off our feet.From the giggly romcoms like ""Hitch"" (remember when Will Smith basically round-house kicked Eva Mendes in the head off her boat?) to sultry, forbidden love affairs like Johnny and Baby's in ""Dirty Dancing,"" we've re-watched some of our favorite flicks to bring you the steamiest ideas for your next date night.""Hitch"" No, we aren't talking about the second date when Alex has a near deathly reaction to seafood (if you remember, that date night didn't end so well). Instead, rewind to their first date in New York Harbor, zipping along the Hudson on jet skis. Those two knew how to beat the sweltering heat! Rent a pair of jet skis and head out on the water without a destination. Race each other and splash each other playfully. See where you end up, whether it's Ellis Island or a hidden sand bar (which is perfect for a covert makeout sesh).""The Blue Lagoon"" As we've said before, there's nothing hotter than vacation sex. But you don't need to be shipwrecked on a deserted island like tanned teenagers Emmeline and Richard for this one -- you can recreate a tropical paradise right at home. Transform your living room into a lover's oasis with some beach-scented candles, wave sounds and massage oils. You can feed each other oysters, take turns giving each other a rubdown and kick back with a few fruity cocktails, just as if you were taking in an oceanfront view.""Dirty Dancing"" Tear up the dance floor by taking a dance class together. Try something new, like salsa or swing. When you feel like you've perfected the moves, show off your new skills at a club. Nobody puts the two of you in the corner (not even Johnny and Baby).""Grease"" Honestly, what flick could be more about summer love than this throwback? Two high schoolers meet at a beach party -- Danny's a Greaser and Sandy's a good girl -- and fall head over heels for each other over the summer. Recreate the summer of 1959 by grabbing some grub at a retro-style diner. But maybe just skip the poodle skirt and the impulse to break out into a rendition of ""Summer Nights"" ... he might just think you're crazy.""Titanic"" Everyone who saw this '90s blockbuster swooned over Rose and Jack and their epic love that couldn't be stopped by a sinking ship. Probably even more swoon-worthy is that oh-so steamy drawing scene. Set up your apartment as an amateur artist's sketching room where you can draw each other (clothed or unclothed). And a little role-playing can only intensify the romance, right? Plus, it's an excuse to say, ""Draw me like one of your French girls, Jack.""""The Notebook"" It's probably Nicholas Sparks' biggest tear-jerking classic: local country boy Noah falls in love with young heiress Allie and the two teenagers become inseparable over one idyllic summer in the 1940s. At one point, they coast out on a canoe together -- a date that ends in the most epic onscreen kiss ever. Rent a canoe and paddle out on the water. And if you get caught in the rain? You can take it as a cosmic sign that you're pretty much meant to be together.""Before Sunrise"" It's that classic idea of two strangers who fall in love, only to be inevitably separated by long distances. Jesse, an American who's backpacking through Europe that summer meets a French girl named Céline on a train from Budapest. Both of them are bound for separate destinations: Jesse is catching a flight back to the United States and Céline is returning to her university in Paris. But they both have one night to spare, so they spend it roaming the city of Vienna together, wining and dining and getting to know one another. Pretend to be tourists in your own town or city. The point is to explore the unexplored: Dine at new restaurants, dance at new clubs, share a glass of wine at a new bar, walk unfamiliar streets without a destination. It sounds like such a simple date idea, but you'll have plenty of time to spend together, just like Jesse and Céline.More Stories From YourTango:The Science Behind Your Hot Summer Fling14 Wedding Planning Horror Stories25 Date Night Ideas That Aren't Cheesy10 Biggest Wedding Day Mistakes Brides MakeHow To Do Eye Makeup For 5 Kinds Of Summer DatesKeep in touch!

A divided Supreme Court said Tuesday that federal law doesn't require that a Native American child be taken away from her adoptive parents and given to her biological father. The justices' 5-4 decision came in a case about a federal law intended to keep Indian children from being taken from their homes and typically placed with non-Indian adoptive or foster parents. South Carolina courts said the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act favored the biological father of the girl, named Veronica. But the South Carolina couple who raised her for the first 27 months of her life appealed that decision.

Veronica herself is 3/256ths Cherokee.The girl lived for the first 27 months of her life with the Capobiancos, but the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that she would have to return to Brown, citing a law that Native American children should not be separated from their tribal heritage.She was returned to Oklahoma and is believed to be living with some of Brown's family.The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the South Carolina court decision in June, saying that Veronica had to return to the South Carolina couple. Brown refused and was arrested on Monday in Oklahoma for interfering with the girl's custody. He was released on bond and is scheduled to appear in court on Sept. 12.""As a mother, my heart goes out to Veronica, who has been placed in a terrible situation,"" Fallin said. ""I can also imagine the pain that both her adopted and biological parents are feeling.""The Oklahoma governor urged Brown and the adoptive parents to reach an agreement that best serves the child.""The legal system cannot deliver a happy ending in this case,"" Fallin said.

Here are five topics you might want to explore with your child.",2013-08-13,Mother hugging teenage son as he packs for college,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d6c841f00005000219c0c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the Princeton Review released its list of top party schools this week, parents of college-bound students began pumping up their lecture material on drug and alcohol use. While these safety conversations are critically important, there are also a few conversations most parents don't think to have until a problem emerges. Here are five topics you might want to explore with your child.1. CybersecurityAfter the pepper spray and ""don't walk alone"" discussions, consider chatting about computer and personal identity protection. College campuses and dorms are ripe for identity theft because students often let their guard down. Of course, there aren't any parents living in the next room issuing reminders, but that's a whole different blog post. Discuss computer safety strategies and the importance of document shredding. Yes, you'll get a few eye rolls, but if you've been a victim of identity theft, you'll agree that it's worth it.2. NeighborsHopefully, our kids head to campus with a backpack full of good manners, but it doesn't hurt to remind them that not everyone in their vicinity is an enthusiastic college student. Students who live in residential areas often need to be reminded that their lifestyles might clash with the family across the street. Being considerate, clean and a little quiet can go a long way in preserving the peace and the lease.3. BikesI have to admit that I didn't see this one coming. When I learned that my sons were biking around New York City, I had a panic attack. We'd covered muggings and subway safety, but I hadn't talked about helmets since the days of training wheels. Yes, they knew about bike safety, but I wanted another shot at getting them to opt out of the behavior or hammering home the critical importance of helmets in preventing head injuries.4. Academic ProblemsWe all want our kids to ace their courses, but sometimes it doesn't happen, and it's not always about studying more. Encourage your child to be academically proactive and to investigate study options and possible course transfer possibilities early in the semester. Keep the lines of curricular communication open so that you can guide your student toward a solution before the end of the grading period.5. EmergenciesWhen saying ""goodbye,"" no one wants to get all doomsday and dreary, but slipping in a serious chat can be a life saver down the road. Discuss with your child an evacuation plan should an emergency situation occur. Identify nearby contacts and transportation options. Examine hospital emergency room options and your medical insurance situation and make a note of options and preferences. And don't forget to include a flashlight, batteries and electronics charger in the back-to-school duffel bag."
