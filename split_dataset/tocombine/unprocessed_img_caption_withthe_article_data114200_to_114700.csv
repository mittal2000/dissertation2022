The topic of the border crisis has dominated the Drudge Report in recent weeks, and Rivera called Drudge out on Twitter and his radio show for allegedly using stories to scare readers about undocumented immigrations. His criticism continued on his radio show, where he told listeners, “I have to say that the level of discourse on these unaccompanied children from Central America has been appalling. It has been disgusting. It is the worst kind of jingoistic rhetoric ever. And Matt Drudge with this massive website is doing his best to stir up a civil war. I mean, shame on Matt Drudge.”He said the Drudge Report's headlines and links — including one that led to World Net Daily's piece ""COULD EBOLA SNEAK ACROSS U.S. BORDER?"" — demonstrated the kind of xenophobia that Irish, Chinese and Jewish immigrants faced when they came to the United States in the past. Rivera's remarks later made it to Drudge's website, which posted headlines quoting his commentary: (h/t CBS DC)"

Five of those senators received a contribution from Bingel shortly before or after those meetings, the Star reports, based on a review of documents filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. That includes a meeting with a legislative assistant for North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan in March 2013 to discuss the Alberta tar sands, which was followed by a $3,761 contribution. There was also a $1,074 contribution to Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) shortly before his staffers met with Bingel. A legislative assistant for Montana Sen. Max Baucus (D), now the ambassador to China, also met with Bingel shortly after receiving a $2,149 contribution. The Star doesn't name the other two senators who received contributions.The proposed pipeline would carry oil from Alberta's tar sands to refineries in Texas, and there has been a major push to usher support from U.S. politicians behind the pipeline. As the Star notes, there's no evidence to show that the funds came directly from the money the firm received from the Alberta government, nor is this arrangement illegal under U.S. lobbying laws:""As an appearance matter, you want to leave a little distance between a contribution and a meeting so it doesn't look like a quid pro quo,"" Kenneth Gross, a specialist on election law and a former lawyer for the U.S. Federal Election Commission, told the Star. ""But in order for it to be illegal, the government would have to prove an actual quid pro quo took place ... that some official action was taken by the congressmen for that contribution.""Even if it's perfectly legal, it is sure to raise a few eyebrows, however, given the highly contentious discussion around the Keystone XL pipeline in Washington."

Abel Maldonado, left, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, second from left, and moderator Dylan Ratigan. Elected officials from across the country have started a new group, called No Labels, aimed at reducing political partisanship. The first meeting of the group attracted 1,000 attendees Monday in New York. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d170240000510057717a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yahoo! News' Meredith Shiner's recent piece on the goofy little group No Labels -- currently leading all comers in the race to be my Summer 2014 Spirit Animal -- has clearly gotten under the organization's skin like it was Lyme Disease. It's not hard to see why, since Shiner spilled the contents of an internal document meant for attendees of the group's late-spring executive board meeting. The document identifies some of No Labels' top-dollar contributors, and finds its ""stop fighting start fixing"" membership hoping that a deeper and more intractable round of gridlock and infighting might raise its profile. Transforming our political culture's baser moments into money-making opportunities is pretty old-hat (search for the phrase ""fundraises off of"" sometime if you doubt this), but Shiner has caught No Labels with its collective pants down, leaving its unseemly hope for more of the division that they are purportedly so heartsick about just dangling in the wind.Given the opportunity, No Labels fails to substantively rebut any of Shiner's reporting. Instead, for her trouble, the organization brands her a cynic -- or more accurately, a victim of cynicism -- which is precisely the sort of thing that Harold Hill would say to someone who is suspicious of trombone-based solutions to everything. (Shiner is a guts-and-glory Chicago White Sox fan, so the ""cynicism"" charge is pretty laughable.)Nevertheless, it's kind of hard not to be cynical about No Labels as an institution. This is a group that routinely passes on taking a material stand on anything -- up to and including issues of great importance to its most prominent members and founders -- in favor of pushing for silly junk like ""bipartisan seating."" A December 2013 Boston Globe report on the organization found that it had been ""unable to advance, in any meaningful way, a single item from its relatively modest list of goals."" As near as I can tell, its last great idea was to have an occasional radio show. (If you've heard it, let me know.)Flash-forward to Shiner's report last week, and here's how the group is spending its money this year:So basically No Labels is hard at work doing press for No Labels, doing outreach for No Labels, doing branding for No Labels, running No Labels, paying No Labels' administrative costs, doing something called ""digital growth,"" and also something called ""Pop."" The outward-facing, change-making activity would be the sliver of spending labeled ""Congressional relations"" and another ideas festival that the world needs like it needs another inexplicable hole in Siberia.Going forward, the organization tells Shiner, it is ""more focused on the 2016 presidential race than the 2014 midterm elections."" Considering that this is a group that thinks everyone in Congress needs to work harder at being BFFs with each other, this is a pretty strange thing on which to be fixated.But Shiner's coup de grace is her description of the dust-up that occurred after No Labels anointed Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is currently challenging incumbent Sen. Mark Udall for his Senate seat, a No Labels ""Problem Solver."" This in turn put the Senate Democratic caucus in high dudgeon. (That any Senate Democrat even cared about this, by the way, is not a good look for them.)Per Shiner, No Labels responded to this contretemps by assuring everyone that its ""problem solver"" designation was completely meaningless:While a group spokesperson told a local Denver Fox affiliate that the ""seal"" is an ""implied endorsement,"" No Labels co-founder Mark McKinnon, a former George W. Bush and John McCain strategist, said that anyone -- even Udall -- would be eligible for such a seal were they join the group [sic].Some guy named Bill Galston goes on to explain that the only requirement to remain a ""Problem Solver"" is to attend some meetings. So it's kind of like Foursquare, in that if you go to your local bar often enough, you become ""mayor"" of your local bar. And that's No Labels in a nutshell: an army of ""problem solvers"" who haven't solved any problems, but you're the cynic.READ THE WHOLE THING: No Labels? No results? No problem. [Yahoo!

4,MEDIA,Gaza in Social Media Images Speaks Volumes,"Magda Abu-Fadil, ContributorDirector of Media Unlimited in Lebanon",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gaza-in-social-media-imag_b_5635270.html,,2014-07-30,2014-07-30-1PotentCarlosLatuffcartoondepictingIsraelislaughterofciviliansasworldstandsidlybycourtesyLatuff.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-30-1PotentCarlosLatuffcartoondepictingIsraelislaughterofciviliansasworldstandsidlybycourtesyLatuff-thumb.jpg,"The images from and about Gaza disseminated through social media are striking, searing, poignant and loaded with messages, proving, yet again, that a picture (or cartoon) is worth a thousand words. They range from neutral to graphic traditional media photos shot at the scene of events, alongside images from ""citizen journalists"" documenting Israel's onslaught on the densely populated strip, where most of the victims have been unarmed civilians, to cartoons and comic pictures making the point in more hard hitting or ironic terms. Potent Carlos Latuff cartoon depicting Israeli slaughter of civilians as  world stands idly by (courtesy Latuff)Brazilian cartoonist Carlos Latuff, who pulls no punches, drew Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu butchering Palestinians in a pool of blood with one hand and asking spectators to shut up with the other.The spectators are U.S. President Barack Obama holding back any help to the victims, as well as the world and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon standing idly by, while dormant Arab leaders snore away amidst the mayhem. That and other illustrations have gone viral since the latest outbreak of violence began, with Twitter acting as a speedy conduit through which to publish news and views. In a variation on the world's inaction theme, campaigners took to the Twittersphere with a fake photo showing Netanyahu, Obama and Ban in a take on the three monkeys who speak, see and hear nothing, and a caption that reads ""3 idiots."" Screen shot of ""speak, see, and hear nothing""Going a step further, Egypt's CBC TV channel tweeted that activists had launched a cartoon drive entitled ""Save the Innocence in Palestine."" It imagined what famous cartoon characters would endure if they lived under Israeli control and one picture in the tweet showed a brutal Netanyahu hammering away at a broken and bleeding Pinocchio. Screen shot of Netanyahu hammering at bleeding PinocchioThe most moving (and rattling) depictions making social media rounds have been photos from traditional and other news sources of dead or bleeding babies and children cut down by weapons fired from Israeli ground, sea and airborne forces. World Editors Forum and WAN-IFRA research fellow Julie Posetti asked whether social media were to blame for the publishing of increasingly graphic images in newspapers.According to Posetti: Social media platforms are the Wild West of publication. Journalists and traditional news publishers are no longer the primary information 'gatekeepers' of public discourse; neither are they able to impose their professional publication standards and ethics on social media users and bloggers. Instead, they are co-creators of content in the social media sphere.A divided picture tweeted this week with half a boy's face smiling and the other half pockmarked by shrapnel wounds carried a message marking a Fitr feast greeting that ended the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.""Eid saeed (huna al aalam) - Eid shaheed (huna Ghazza),"" the rhyming caption said. Translation: Happy feast (from the world), martyr's feast (from Gaza). Screen shot of Eid Saeed - Eid shaheed tweetWith competition in a 24/7 news cycle at fever pitch, images can easily trip up legacy media reporters and editors. According to Posetti, creators of user-generated content are sharing the public domain in debates about Gaza and other hotspots to grab various audiences' attention. Under these conditions, adding proper sourcing and context within ethical parameters becomes increasingly difficult, but not necessarily impossible.One such context is history, and comparing or contrasting events.Remi Brulin, a research fellow at New York University, tweeted that Israeli pronouncements to the besieged Gaza population were straight out of the French colonial playbook in Algeria in the 1950s. Screen shot of tweet on Gaza being equal to French  colonization of AlgeriaHe produced a message on a page from a book addressed to residents of an Algerian area in which the colonial power at the time warned people to either choose France's peace and protection or face ""crime"" (by not submitting) and inevitable subsequent punishment."

Everyone still wants to know, ""Well, how do you feel?"" I've lived in L.A. for more than 20 years now, but rarely does news happen in Cleveland without me hearing from lots of folks asking for my thoughts on what it means for my beloved hometown. In 2010, my cousin Joey and I spent hours on the phone after LeBron announced he'd be leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers to ""take his talents to South Beach."" Those were dark days. The whole city felt abandoned by one of its own -- who's also one of the greatest athletes to ever play the game of basketball. Worse than jilted, Cleveland had been tossed aside like any other city seen as past its prime. Being dumped was bad enough, but LeBron did it in front of millions the world over! ""Of course,"" I'd told Joey, ""this is America, and the man has a right to play wherever he wants to play."" But the loss was no less painful. Cleveland back then was already dealing with low self-esteem that -- prior to ""The Decision"" -- had been satirized in such viral videos as ""Hastily Made Tourism Video."" Tourists were beckoned to Cleveland to see ""both of our buildings"" while touting the fact that the city leads the nation in the number of drifters. A video proclaimed ""crippling depression"" as the main export, yet admitted, ""It could be worse -- at least we're not Detroit!"" All over the top, obviously, but one line about Cleveland having an economy based on LeBron James was mostly true. So, yeah, I understood Clevelanders who declared LeBron forever dead to them. Still, I have my own journey as a prodigal son who once had to leave Cleveland in order to grow up, only to later return so I could discover my real story -- chronicled in my memoir, FINDING FISH and dramatized in the film ANTWONE FISHER. If you're familiar with either, you'll recall that I started life as an orphan/Ward of the State, raised in foster care before being forced into becoming an emancipated minor. At 18, alone in the world, I also became homeless. I survived -- thanks to advice from Bill Ward, the last of a series of social workers assigned to my case over the years. Ward simply cautioned me not to feel sorry for myself. Homeless in Cleveland with winter coming, I didn't have that luxury, and thus made the decision to enlist in the U.S. Navy -- setting me on a course to change my life for the better. Fifteen years later, I lowered anchor in Los Angeles, attaining my first civilian job as a security guard at Sony Pictures. At that point I chose to return to Cleveland for a visit to find the family I'd never known. The city seemed frozen in time, as if everyone stayed the same and only I had changed. A shopkeeper in my old neighborhood recognized me, saying, ""Antwone, where you been?"" Like I was one of those people who go out on an errand and just decide not to come back. Or like it was only the other day. No big deal. But of course it was. At age 33, I solved the mystery of where I actually came from and also found the catalyst for my journey as a Hollywood screenwriter and author. Nine years later, I returned again to Cleveland to film the story of my life (as the screenwriter), along with our director, Denzel Washington, and the rest of the cast and crew. This time, my hometown welcomed me back with all the ceremony of a much-loved native son. Each day of filming brought out bigger and bigger crowds. My most prized memory? The day that a production assistant found me and pointed to the crowd, saying, ""A guy named Bill Ward over there wants you to know he's here."" When I spotted the social worker who'd given me great advice, he looked unchanged as he gave me a thumbs up and yelled out, ""Way to come home, Antwone. Way to come home."" The crowd roared in agreement. It hit me: my city had as much at stake as I did in my succeeding out there in the world.How do I feel about LeBron coming back to Cleveland. I feel great! When I read ""The Letter,"" I almost cried. During his absence, the city had to do some soul-searching and growth of its own -- which I observed during a recent visit. Driving by the historic Karamu House, I was astonished to see an enormous mural of Ruby Dee painted on the west wall of the Karamu House Theater. This was where Ruby Dee, who grew up in Cleveland too, trained and performed. Sadly, Ruby Dee passed away this past summer, but throughout her life she returned home often to train and inspire younger generations of actors.With a new air of reclaimed confidence, the city seemed to be flourishing. When I took Euclid Avenue east toward downtown, I witnessed streets alive with sound and activity. Along this route, I came upon the old Halle Brothers Luxury Department Store -- built in 1910, still with its white terra-cotta façade -- a repository of childhood memories. The building, now being readied for a new life, reminded me of a recent conversation with Halle Berry about her years growing up in Cleveland. When I mentioned how it irked me to hear someone call her 'Holly,' she smiled, grateful that I knew she was named for our hometown's iconic luxury department store, Halle's.Also on Euclid, I spotted a young interracial couple on a Vespa motor scooter breezing westbound. As a boy growing up in this city, a carefree young black and white couple riding an Italian motor scooter was a sight I would not have seen, given race relations of the times. My first thought was: ""Oh my ... really?"" Clearly, the city was moving into the future, readying for a big comeback. This was evident when I arrived at the city's theater district that's now revitalized with businesses, restaurants, shops and boutiques. The old buildings that I remember have been sandblasted, steamed clean and remodeled as apartments and condominiums for downtown living.The visit culminated with a last look at the spot where Terminal Tower is located.It's a building that has fascinated me more than any other back home and I saw it too gleaming with new vitality. Wow, I thought, my city, Cleveland, is alive again, proud of its great universities, renowned hospitals, museums and a world-famous symphony. Young people were present everywhere, a sight that inspired me to contemplate a full-time return to this city. With my wife and two daughters, life could be grand in a condominium downtown where I could take my morning paper and get coffee at a café nearby, as if I were in some old, French town.LeBron will only add to this revival. He won't define it. Yep, all is forgiven. We've all grown up. We've learned that why we go away and why we come back are more complicated than we'd like -- much as LeBron writes: ""Before anyone ever cared where I would play basketball, I was a kid from Northeast Ohio. It's where I walked. It's where I ran. It's where I cried. It's where I bled ... My relationship with Northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball. I didn't realize that four years ago. I do now."" I can only applaud his belief that he has a responsibility to lead and inspire kids growing up in the area to value their roots, or, as LeBron puts it: ""Like the hundreds of Akron third-graders I sponsor through my foundation, to realize that there's no better place to grow up. Maybe some of them will come home after college and start a family or open a business. That would make me smile. Our community, which has struggled so much, needs all the talent it can get.""The truth is Cleveland belongs to all of us who have ever had roots there. I know that every city has its issues, but this great American city has given the world so much from the Industrial Revolution to this brand new age and it's still ""the best location in the nation."""
6,POLITICS,Obama Expected To Sign New Executive Order On Federal Contract Workers,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-contract-executive-order_n_5635140.html,,2014-07-30,"President Barack Obama pauses to smile as he speaks at Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference, Friday, April 11, 2014, in New York. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d16f260000360083b962.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is expected to issue an executive order on Thursday seeking enhanced workplace conditions and rights for federal contract workers, three separate sources have told The Huffington Post. One of those sources told The Huffington Post that “progressive workers' rights groups are getting asked for workers who would be impacted by the executive order to be there [at the White House] tomorrow.”The exact details of the order remain unknown. The White House has not responded to repeated and numerous requests for comment. But sources outside the administration expect it to require contractors to disclose labor law violations. The order is also expected to encourage executive agencies to consider labor law violations when ordering federal contracts. A preview of the president's likely intentions may have been given on Tuesday in a post by the Obama-allied Center for American Progress. That post encouraged the president to sign an executive order that would “ensure that only companies that comply with federal workplace laws are able to receive federal contracts.”The issuing of an executive order by the president on Thursday would indicate that the administration feels unbowed by a lawsuit brought forth by congressional Republicans challenging the extent of the executive actions he has taken. Over the past year and a half there have been nine protests by low-wage federal contract workers over the conditions at their workplaces. In June 2013, workers at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center filed a complaint with the Labor Department alleging labor violations. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, meanwhile, released a report late last year documenting some of the poor conditions of workers for federal contractors. The report noted that 18 federal contractors ""were recipients of one of the largest 100 penalties issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor between 2007 and 2012.""The president has already signed one related executive order, setting a minimum wage of $10.10 per hour for workers under federal contracts. Workers have been encouraged by the order, but also have pushed the administration to take additional action that would, among other things, enhance their collective bargaining rights, protect them from wage theft and enhance workplace protections. In addition, the Congressional Progressive Caucus has urged the president to sign an executive order along these lines. In a letter sent last week, the caucus chairs called for a Good Jobs Executive Order that touched on three tenets: guaranteeing labor and employment law protections; adopting a “fair compensation preference” (in which contractors would be favored if they provided a living wage and full benefits package); and respecting workers’ rights to negotiate. “The President is leading by example, establishing the principle that if you are breaking the law, you don’t get to do business with the Federal government,"" said Joseph Geevarghese, deputy director of Change to Win, a sponsor of the Good Jobs Nation campaign of low wage federal contract workers. ""Just like the $10.10 executive order had a ripple effect across the economy, we hope that this bold step by the President sends a clear signal to the private sector that you need to do right by your workers.”Want more updates from Sam?

7,TASTE,"Corn Pancakes, The Early Arrival Of An Annual Celebration","Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-corn_1_b_5631372.html,We ate ours with maple syrup: its sweetness works marvelously well with the sweet-savory pancakes.,2014-07-30,"First cut off the kernels, then scrape the ""milk"" from the cobs",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e373b2100003300c5d4c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Every summer, Jackie and I have corn pancakes at least once, often several times. Usually we await the reddening of the local peppers -- that sweet, juicy, infinitesimally sharp flavor is part of the allure. But this year's first corn pancakes landed on our plates earlier than usual, simply because of my careless shopping. I'd bought three ears of corn that, when shucked, proved to be not quite moist or dewy fresh enough to eat right off the cob. And even though the peppers in the market bag were green, the onions were young and sweet. Pancakes would be a good option.So that's what we had for dinner. I started by cutting half a large onion into dice around the size of corn kernels and sweating it in butter with a little salt. When the onion was nearly cooked, I added a so-called frying pepper (the elongated, thin-walled pale green kind -- sweet, not hot), cut into similar sized dice, and continued to cook for just a minute to keep the peppers on the crunchy side. (If I'd had a small hot pepper I'd have added it too, minced fine.) I set this aside to cool.With a knife, I cut the kernels from three medium-sized ears of corn into a bowl, then used the same knife to scrape down the cobs, squeezing out the starchy liquid and pulp. This damp pulp I put into the bowl of a food processor along with half of the kernels. (I sometimes puree only a third of the kernels; which way I go is dictated by whim, the point being that the proportions are not crucial.) I pureed this with fresh tarragon (smaller amounts of thyme or sage would be good alternatives, and lots of parsley would be nice too), a half cup of milk and two eggs. I added a generous cup (say, 175 g) of flour. I started with 3/4 that quantity and gradually added more until a thick but easily spoonable batter formed. Like a breakfast-pancake batter, in fact. Note that there was no leavening such as baking powder or whipped egg whites: I didn't want a cakey pancake in this instance.I stirred this puree into the remaining whole corn kernels and added the onion-pepper mixture, then checked for seasoning both by tasting the raw batter and by cooking a teaspoonful of it in a little skillet. The batter now sat around for half an hour or so. This does in fact improve the mixture, but not enough for it to be really necessary: the wait was dictated by the timing of dinner.To cook the pancakes, I heated a thick-bottomed skillet (a griddle would be fine), greased it with just a smear of butter (or slick of neutral oil) and spooned in the batter by big cooking-spoonsful - these quantities made eight pancakes 3 or 3-1/2 inches (say 8 cm) across. I cooked them fairly slowly - the batter must cook through - turning once when the first side was nice and brown. If you need to work in batches (I did), you can keep Batch A warm in a 150-degree F (65 C) oven or you can let them start to get cool. Or, of course, you can go ahead and eat if you don't mind hopping up every 20 seconds to check on the progress of the second batch.We ate ours with maple syrup: its sweetness works marvelously well with the sweet-savory pancakes. Other options include gravy from last week's roast or stew (corn pancakes make a fine accompaniment to such dishes if you don't want to make a whole meal of them); a fresh tomato salsa; maybe even some sort of sweet-hot chutney or relish. Those not-red peppers had great flavor, by the way: Jackie smelled them from two rooms away as I was cutting them up. But that doesn't mean we aren't looking forward to another batch as soon as the farmers' market peppers turn red. Ten days? Two weeks? I'll post an update on Twitter if I think of it."

The head of a government agency for entertainment had been removed from his post following the incident overnight, the presidency added.Witnesses said the event was attended by up to 10,000 people, mostly children and youths, who came to see popular local rap groups 'Banlieuzart' and 'Instinct Killers'.In January, six youths were killed on another beach in Conakry when a bridge collapsed during New Year's celebrations. Conakry's beaches are small compared to other regional capitals like Dakar and Freetown and entrances and exits are often narrow.The stampede, which occurred during celebrations to mark the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan in mainly Muslim Guinea, comes at a time when health workers are stretched by an outbreak of Ebola.The deadly tropical virus was first detected in the poor, mineral-rich West African country in February and has since spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone, killing more than 670 people, according to the World Health Organization.

""He's got a mixed track record.""A lawyer and campaign veteran who became a Democrat nearly two years ago, Crist served as the Republican governor from 2007 to 2011 after beginning his political career as a state senator, where he was dubbed ""Chain Gang Charlie"" for proposing prisoner roadside work crews.""I believe in justice, and I think most Floridians do,"" Crist told Reuters when asked about the inflammatory nickname. He added, ""I also believe in forgiveness.""The moniker has resurfaced lately in racially charged radio ads and flyers, while some early polls show his support among black voters, who make up more than a quarter of Florida's Democrats, falling short of what is likely needed to wrestle the state from Republican hands after almost 16 years.Since switching parties, Crist has changed several political positions: he now supports gay marriage and gun control. He has made high-profile public appearances with party heavyweights such as President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton.Still, he has struggled to convince some voters, who view him as a political opportunist, that he has their interests at heart. Many black voters, in particular, were turned off in 2010 when Crist jumped into a U.S. Senate race as an independent, after a challenge from the right in a Republican primary, drawing support away from the black Democratic candidate.""Charlie Crist is a smooth operator, a used car salesman, but he doesn't mean the African American community any good,"" said Leslie Wimes, a black Democratic blogger who founded a women's business group in south Florida.A recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac University put his support among black voters at 72 percent against Scott, well below the more than 90 percent analysts believe he needs to win.At about the same time, a poll by SurveyUSA for a Tampa-area TV station showed he may be gaining ground. It put his support among black voters at 92 percent, an abrupt jump of 20 to 30 points from earlier surveys by the group, although pollsters warned it was too early in the race to draw conclusions.Crist said he will get the votes. His campaign, which appears to be making inroads by reaching out to black church leaders and canvassing neighborhoods, points to several policies he pushed through as a Republican that won praise from black leaders.In 2008, for instance, when voters were standing in long lines at the polls, Crist extended early voting hours. He also helped restore voting rights for many felons.Earlier this month, Crist was warmly greeted at a predominantly black church in Tampa during a candidate forum.In the audience was Iris Metcalf, a 51-year-old secretary who voted for Crist for governor when he ran as a Republican. ""Parties evolve and people evolve,"" said Metcalf, who still supports Crist.Crist's biggest hurdle in securing the key black turnout may be a series of provocative ads by Progressive Choice, a group based in Maryland that says it formed some months ago to advocate for liberal issues such as reproductive choice, equal rights and education.While the group has criticized Crist's positions as a Republican on a range of issues, its most vociferous attacks have centered on race.One of the ads, set against a pulsing hip hop beat, urges black voters to break the chains, a reference to his past support of chain gangs. Another ad blames him for a ""lost generation of African Americans.""As a federally registered, social welfare organization, Progressive Choice does not disclose donors. Crist strategists call it a shadow operation for conservatives, which the group denies.""The challenge in front of him is owning up,"" said Dwight Bullard, a Democratic state senator from a prominent black political family who is supporting Crist's underdog opponent in an August primary. ""To let those ads linger out there unanswered, I think, is really harming the turnout.""The challenge for Crist is to lure black voters to the polls by addressing issues they care about, such as school discipline and the justice system, political analysts said.""Democrats are not going to be voting for Rick Scott. The question is whether or not they will turn out to vote,"" Smith said.

11,RELIGION,SNAP Is 25 Years Old And More Vocal Against Priest Abuse Than Ever,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snap-25-priest-abuse_n_5631332.html,,2014-07-30,"Protesters gather outside the Cathedral Basilica in St. Louis Wednesday, June 11, 2014 to express concerns about the leadership of Archbishop Robert Carlson. The protest was organized by part by the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, a group that believes Carlson has failed to support victims of clergy abuse both during his time in Minnesota and in the five years he has been in St. Louis. (AP Photo/Jim Salter)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ecca3c000066000daf43.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) When victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests first organized into a small band of volunteer activists in the late 1980s, reports of clergy molesting children were still new and relatively few. Most were minimized as anomalies or dismissed altogether — much the way the victims were.But today, as the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, marks its 25th anniversary at a conference in Chicago (Aug. 1-3), its members can take satisfaction in seeing that its claims have been validated, and a few (though hardly all) of its recommendations have been implemented by the church hierarchy.And instead of facing constant verbal attacks and the occasional angry parishioner spitting on them at a protest, SNAP’s members today are far more likely to receive a handshake and a word of thanks, and maybe even a donation.SNAP’s advocacy on the Catholic scandal also helped push the reality of sexual abuse into the public consciousness to the point that victims can regularly win in courts and get a hearing in the media, and they are much more likely to come forward to tell their stories, whether they were abused by clergy or by athletic coaches or Boy Scout leaders.Yet that success is also presenting SNAP with a daunting new challenge as it looks to the future: how to respond to a flood of new inquiries from victims from other faiths and institutions, and how to push for changes beyond the familiar precincts of the Catholic Church.“We are continuing to grow, and more of the growth is coming overseas and in non-Catholic institutional abuse, mostly religious institutions but a surprising number of secular ones as well,” said David Clohessy, SNAP’s national director.The appeals for help from SNAP have increased so much — from students abused by teachers to victims of former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky — that SNAP has set up chapters specifically for victims from non-Catholic churches and for those who were abused in the Boy Scouts or on mission trips.“There’s no question that the response of Catholic victims has empowered victims in other denominations and other groups,” said the Rev. Thomas Doyle, a Dominican priest and canon lawyer who has been one of the most outspoken champions of the victims, and a vocal critic of the hierarchy.“They turn to SNAP because SNAP is internationally known,” he said. While advocacy groups for other communities — such as the Eastern Orthodox or Jehovah’s Witnesses or Baptists – have sprung up, “none of them are in SNAP’s league,” he said.Yet that success also brings new hurdles, such as figuring out the power dynamics and pressure points of religious and secular groups that are organized far differently from the Catholic Church.Indeed, even some of SNAP’s strongest supporters wonder whether the group needs to recalibrate an approach that they say is so uncompromising that it can be counterproductive.Clohessy, who was abused by a priest as a child and whose own brother was accused of abuse before leaving the priesthood, said outsiders find it hard to appreciate how much SNAP’s hard-line posture is driven by the experience of abuse, and the knowledge that abuse continues.“I’m sure we could be more effective, somehow,” said Clohessy, 58. But, he added, “we do an incredible disservice to kids when we repeatedly give church officials every possible benefit of the doubt.”For SNAP’s members, it is not strategy as much as money that remains the overriding concern.“It never feels (financially) stable enough by any stretch,” Clohessy said. “And it feels especially inadequate as we try to grow internationally. It’s always been a struggle, likely always will be a struggle.”In fact, SNAP has always had something of a roller-coaster existence.The group began life in the late 1980s, a couple of years after journalists — led by Jason Berry’s reporting on abusive clerics in Louisiana — began to pull back the veil of secrecy on the sexual abuse of children by Catholic clergy.As the reports came to light, Barbara Blaine, a lawyer and social worker who had been molested by a priest when she was growing up in Toledo, Ohio, started contacting as many other victims as she could find, posting ads and asking prosecutors and attorneys to put her in touch with other victims.SNAP soon developed a core membership of a few thousand people, mainly victims, who met in small support groups while also trying to push the issue onto the public agenda. It was a tough slog in the face of public indifference or outright hostility.Then in January 2002, The Boston Globe began its groundbreaking series of exposes on the widespread abuse of children by priests in the Boston archdiocese, and the cover-up by bishops. The story caught fire and led to similar revelations across the nation and to an unprecedented level of media coverage, prosecutions, lawsuits and billions in payouts by dioceses.“We went from an organization that couldn’t get its calls returned to one that couldn’t return its calls,” Clohessy said.SNAP’s membership took off, and now stands at more than 19,000, with 60 chapters around the U.S. and eight overseas. In mid-2002 Clohessy was hired as the group’s first paid staffer, and Blaine, the president, was the second; there is now another full-time staff person, as well as two part-time administrators and myriad volunteers.The problem is that SNAP’s annual revenue record looks like a bad fever chart.Starting in 2002, annual revenues spiked from next to nothing and then approached $1 million in 2006, much of it in the form of donations from victims who settled abuse lawsuits. But donations fluctuated widely after that, including a decade-low of about $350,000 in 2010 when SNAP was facing a series of costly legal challenges from Catholic bishops in Missouri.(Annual income now stands just over $700,000, with many small donations coming from lay Catholics, and larger sums from victims and plaintiff’s lawyers, Clohessy said.)Today SNAP is focused on trying to steady the donation stream so it can more effectively address the new demands from different venues.But not everyone is convinced that SNAP should be so quick to pivot away from its traditional Catholic focus.Berry, the muckraking journalist who will keynote SNAP’s conference this weekend, said the group is making a mistake by not taking taking up Pope Francis’ offer to engage the Vatican on serious structural reforms that could fulfill many of SNAP’s outstanding demands.“I think SNAP does itself a disservice by constantly criticizing (Francis) and saying nothing’s changed,” Berry said, noting that SNAP dismissed Francis’ meeting with abuse victims in June as “self-serving” and “public relations.”Berry said “there is a risk in becoming an ecumenical abuse survivors movement” because that can “dilute their focus” at a critical juncture.“The crossroads where they stand now has less to do with branching out in an ecumenical sense — laudable and important as that may be — than having a clearer sense of driving the change in the Catholic Church. That involves learning how to negotiate, and that’s not exactly part of their skill set.”"

They feel deeply. They bond deeply. They love deeply. When my stubborn, huge-hearted dog Spike was getting old and sick, I tended to him as if he was one of the family -- because he was. For weeks before he ended up dying on my bedroom floor from a seemingly endless seizure (in reality, it probably lasted less than a minute), I would carry him outside, cradling his 50-pound body, because he was too weak to walk. Sure, I strained my back a little. I would have practically broken my back for him -- #becausedogs, #becauselove.The Obama administration has just authorized the use of ""sonic cannons"" to explore for oil deposits off the U.S. Eastern Seaboard. The cannons create a kind of sonogram for oil companies by shooting sound waves 100 times louder than a jet engine toward the ocean floor. The sound waves also shatter the ear bones of dolphins and whales that depend on their hearing to feed. ""Once they can't hear, they are pretty much done for,"" said Kate Zimmerman a spokeswoman for the South Caroline Coastal Conservation League.The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management both granted approval for the sonic exploration and, at the same time, released a study determining that ""more than"" 138,000 sea creatures could be harmed.Probably, this will probably happen. Probably, ""more than"" 138,000 sea animals will be harmed. Fossil fuel lobbyists say that there are over four billion barrels of recoverable oil and over 37 trillion cubic feet of natural gas beneath those waters that could generate $195 billion of investments between 2017-2035.Actually, let's ratchet up ""probably"" to ""more than probably,"" because the hard-wired momentum of economic growth, especially within the fossil fuel industry will not be stopped, nor even slowed. More than probably the dolphins and the whales will suffer. And they will die.At this point in the article, you and I and almost everyone reading will automatically go into shut-down mode. We realize that -- as magnificent and loving as our cats and dogs clearly and irrefutably are -- whales and dolphins are, in a sense, something else again. They are, by many accounts, and with possible apologies to the primates, the most deeply intelligent and ""feeling-full"" of all our fellow life beings.And now we will kill thousands more of them. And we cannot remain emotionally open to this situation. We just can't because, numbed though we may be, somewhere inside we understand what we are perpetrating. It's too much to take in, and so... we shut down. We turn our thoughts and feelings away. And here's the strange thing: The fact that the numbers are so great makes it easier to turn away! If any one of us, possibly excluding the diagnostically sociopathic, could bond with any single one of those dolphins or whales to the degree that we bond with our dogs and cats and horses and parakeets, we would practically break our backs (perhaps we would break our backs!) to prevent unnecessary harm from befalling them. Just imagine -- your companion dolphin, who comes to the cove by your house for a daily visit, is swimming along, frolicking with his family, when, in mid-dive, a sonic canon boom turns his radar system to jelly. His world explodes. His family watches, helpless and puzzled as he stops eating, stops hunting... and then dies.But our world has become ""anonymous."" The systems are too big and too impersonal, too remote. Unnecessary suffering thrives in between the countless cracks of our grinding impersonal Matrix. (""Neo, where are you?!"") I use the phrase ""unnecessary suffering"" because some degree of pain and suffering is unavoidably woven into the natural fabric of existence on Earth. People and animals inevitably get sick and die. Every time we go for a walk, we crush living things in our wakes. Animals eat each other to survive. Most humans still chose to eat meat and some must do so due to medical needs. The first injunction in many spiritual paths is some variation of ""do no harm."" In practical terms, this can be translated to ""do as little harm as humanly possible and, when it is necessary to harm, act with humility, awareness and gratitude to what is being sacrificed on your behalf."" In this sense, love and stewardship of each other and of our fellow beings is placed on the highest pedestal. It is what we inexorably aspire to, though we fall short time and time again.And so, one would think and hope and fervently pray that this impending ""collateral"" slaughter of our deeply intelligent, deeply ""feeling-full"" fellow mammals has been green-lighted in the name of an overwhelming, do-or-die level of necessity. Anything less would indicate an almost irremediable level of disregard of what we purport to so preciously value.Well, of course, it is precisely the opposite. Here are the conclusions of the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research/World Bank study that determined that a business-as-usual track of fossil fuel use will take us to four degrees centigrade (4C) warming (7.2 Fahrenheit) as soon as the 2060s: The 4C scenarios are devastating; inundations of coastal cities, unprecedented heat waves, severe drought, food and water scarcity...That world would be so dramatically different from today's that it is hard to describe. A 4C world can and must be avoided.The word ""courage"" means to come bravely from the heart. The injunction to ""do no harm"" then is not for the faint of heart. At this point, to deny or ignore the findings of the world's scientists is not a courageous act. It is a fundamentally non-rational act that indicates that you are hiding from an unpleasant and, yes, scary situation. You may be hiding for any variety of ideological, psychological or, perhaps, ""bottom-line"" motives. To quail from an unpleasant situation is, of course, very human and -- excepting folks who are consciously profiting from their denial -- worthy of compassion. But let us please dispense with the pretense that the refusal to acknowledge the realities of our current situation is anything less than deeply destructive. We are doing the equivalent of taking my dog Spike and your dog Mylo and her cat Brighty and his horse Cheyenne and killing them in the name of expanding the production of substances that are in the process of killing our world. The United States prides itself on being ""the home of the brave."" Just because something is called ""brave,"" does not make it so. Bravery requires the fortitude to go beyond one's preconceived notions in the name of ""clear seeing,"" and then to act accordingly. To cause destruction and death in the name of activities that are, in themselves, clearly destructive, is very far from brave. Let's at least have the courage to do this: Let's tell it like it is.Here is a link to a petition against the new sonic cannon exploration: Act.oceana.org"

Barry Finegold at the Statehouse in Boston, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2014. The two Massachusetts senators will introduce new legislation in response to a recent ruling from the state's highest court that sentencing juveniles convicted of murder to life without parole is unconstitutional. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d06f200000070201d109.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let's say you support a candidate for public office and you want to make a financial contribution to his or her campaign. How much could you afford to contribute? $5, $10 or $25? Maybe even $50? Or maybe nothing at all? You're not alone. The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that, of the 310 million people in our country, just 0.1 percent of Americans are making political contributions of $200 or more. And, yet, the Massachusetts legislature is aiming to increase the amount of money individuals can give to candidates running for state and local office from $500 to $1000 per calendar year.And they are doing it under the disguise of transparency. Buried in a bill focused on improving disclosure of the sources of campaign expenditures is the provision to increase limits for campaign contributions. Why are our legislators doing this? ""Prices have gone up,"" says Massachusetts State Senator Barry Finegold, the co-chair of the Election Law Committee and a leading proponent of this increase in the contribution limits.Well, Senator Finegold, prices have also gone up for food, housing and healthcare, among other basic needs. $500 is still way beyond the means of the vast majority of people for making a political donation. Only the very wealthy can afford to give that kind of money to a candidate. And, now Massachusetts legislators want to double the influence that wealthy donors can exert over our political process.Are members of the donor class asking for this increase? Maybe not. As Peter Schweizer, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes and Line Their Own Pockets, argues: politicians ""play the shakedown game as well as anyone."" Those who are used to giving the maximum political donations of $500 to Massachusetts candidates can now expect those candidates to press for the new maximum amount, saying the prices have gone up.This increase in the contribution limits is an incumbent-protection measure. It strengthens the ability of those in power to build campaign war chests that scare away most challengers from waging competitive campaigns. Only the very wealthy or those connected to the very wealthy can dare to compete against such war chests. The rest of us must remain on the sidelines. If anything, we should be lowering the contribution limits, not raising them. Our current campaign finance system operates like a wealth primary where elite donors pre-select candidates who can compete and go on to win election, based on their access to wealth. Like the prior poll tax which required citizens to pay a fee in order to vote -- effectively disenfranchising the poor, this system makes wealth a determinant factor in our elections. It violates the constitutional promises of one person, one vote and of political equality for all. Increasing the amount of money the very rich can contribute to candidates will only exacerbate further this wealth primary barrier. And, our democracy will continue to suffer.Yes, we need stronger disclosure laws governing money in politics, just like we need public funding of campaigns and a constitutional amendment to allow for overall campaign spending limits to end the big money dominance of our elections. But, what we don't need is an increase in the contribution limits so that the wealthy can exert even more control or the incumbents can extort even more from the donor class. If Massachusetts legislators want to double the contribution limits in state politics, they should, in the light of day, create a stand-alone bill to do that and try to pass it. But, they should not bury it in a disclosure bill and call it reform."
