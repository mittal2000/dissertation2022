0,DIVORCE,Making The Most Of Your Consultation With A Divorce Lawyer,"Jacqueline Harounian, Esq., Contributor
Partner, The Law Firm of Wisselman, Harounian & Associates",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/making-the-most-of-your-c_us_5b9ce75be4b03a1dcc82d948,"Receiving a free consultation with an attorney can be extremely helpful, if you know how to make the most of the time.",2013-03-14,Mature female lawyer or notary with client in her office - handshake,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce75b2100005100c54f4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Receiving a free consultation with an attorney can be extremely helpful, if you know how to make the most of the time. A typical legal consultation takes about an hour, during which you share information with the attorney relevant to your legal issue. In return, taking into account the information you provided, the attorney will let you know your legal rights and options. It is important to prepare for a divorce consultation. First, you should prepare emotionally. Be prepared to discuss things that are very personal, which you may not be accustomed to discussing with others. This is especially true when you are having marital or familial difficulties. Know that it is okay to express anger, frustration, and pain, and that it is okay to cry. Acknowledging these emotions before you meet with an attorney will help the meeting go more easily for you. Next, be prepared to discuss what assets you and your spouse have. Types of assets may include bank accounts, retirement funds, businesses, cars, boats and homes. Also, be prepared to discuss debts -- mortgages, equity loans, bank loans, student loans, and of course, credit card debt. Having an upfront discussion of assets and debts in an initial consultation will allow the attorney to get a broad idea of your situation and spot any potential issues right away. Income is the next critical piece of information that you should be prepared to discuss. Not only is each party's income (or lack thereof) significant in determining how much child support and/or spousal maintenance a party will ultimately pay (or receive), but it also greatly affects a party's ability to pursue litigation. It's also vital to come in with an idea of what your goals are and your ideal outcome is. The more honest you are with your attorney and yourself at the start of your case, the more effective your attorney can be. Ask yourself questions such as, ""Do I really want custody of my child with my work schedule, when the other parent is more available?"" or ""How important is it for me to stay in our home?"" Ideally, these types of questions should be thought about before you meet with an attorney. Be sure to bring with you copies of any legal documents that you already have, such as a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement, divorce summons, an order of protection or domestic incident report. If you are already represented by an attorney and you are looking to change counsel, come prepared to discuss what has occurred in your case so far, and bring with you copies of court orders and agreements. It is natural to want to keep personal family information private, especially when it can feel embarrassing, but it is important to discuss these matters confidentially at a legal consultation. There may be questions such as, ""Has there been domestic violence?"" or ""Has either person had an affair?"" Being truthful with your answers in a consultation will help the attorney better understand your situation. If you're not sure whether information is relevant or not, share it anyway. Being truthful and upfront will help your lawyer to help you more effectively.Remember that all information disclosed to an attorney in a consultation is confidential, so there is no fear in being honest. If you are contemplating divorce, meeting with an attorney for the first time can be a daunting first step and it is perfectly okay at an initial consultation not to know what you have, or what you want. But, if you can, by being prepared, organized and communicative with the attorney, you will get the most out of the consultation. We offer a free initial consultation because we believe it is important for the client and attorney to get to know each other and determine your objectives and areas of priority before proceeding with the case and the client-attorney relationship."

From her modest but cozy home in the mountains of North Carolina, Ashley English is providing a model of party-giving and camaraderie for a generation more concerned about authenticity and human connection than about making a big splash. ""Did you see that Martha Stewart reissued her classic book Entertaining?"" English says. ""It's exquisite, page after page of parties that are beyond beautiful, but it's almost like standing behind a velvet rope at Versailles -- it's just all so over the top that you'd leaf through it, then put it back on the shelf and feel further away than ever from being able to pull off something special.""Parties don't have to be a huge deal. They can revolve around anything, English says: ""With a good, narrow theme, people get it right away."" Establish that, and suddenly you're hosting something special. An ""ice-cream social"" with creative guests isn't going to yield 15 cartons of store-bought vanilla. ""You need someone to bring crushed toffee, someone else to bring stewed peaches, someone else to make waffle cones,"" English says. ""Once you have one or two events, people get lit up for the next one -- they know how to play along.""But English is far more than just a party-giver. She's also an exemplar of modern self-reliant living, the ultimate low-key style goddess of a generation that's relearning how to do it themselves. She's published books on raising chickens, canning and preserving, making pies, keeping bees and establishing a home dairy. ""Making environmentally sensible lifestyle choices need not be daunting,"" she writes on her website. ""There are simple, daily gestures individuals can take to benefit themselves, their families, their communities, and the planet.""For many years, English says, these simple values got lost in a culture that valued glamour over neighborliness. But an economic collapse has a way of reigniting the value of thrift and self-reliance. ""For a while there, when domesticana had its resurgence in the form of coffee table books, I think we lost our way. Too many of us got intimidated. Homesteading is not an aesthetic or a showcase for bought taste. It's the essence of thrift come to life. All we have to do is relearn our grandparents' tricks and pass them around. We need to take it all back, turn it into a collective, and make it ours again.""All that's needed is a network of friends and neighbors and the ability to tap into the resources around you. Not everyone has to cook or can. You may know people who work with wood, or sew, or play music. Having some willing dishwashers on hand helps, too. In Ashley English's world, everyone contributes to the feast. ""All of us have something to evangelize, something that makes us proud to create or cook or make,"" she says. ""We've got so much to share. The food, really, is just a gathering point to make that happen. When we pull off an incredible night, we feel like we've accessed something that would have otherwise felt closed off to us. It's a triumph every time.""This video from Dark Rye was produced by Kelly Le Castre and edited by Andy Pickard."
2,DIVORCE,Hold The Wrath,"Wendy Plump, Contributor
Reporter and author of ""Vow: A Memoir of Marriage (And Other A...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hold-the-wrath_us_5b9cea94e4b03a1dcc82ee91,One of the things that surprises me most about infidelity is that anyone is shocked to the point of awe when it happens.,2013-03-14,Young beautiful amorous couple making love in bed on white background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cea942000002d00fdc383.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the things that surprises me most about infidelity is that anyone is shocked to the point of awe when it happens.I'm not talking about the wife or the husband, who may certainly be blindsided; they have every reason to assume the most abiding loyalties from the marriage. I'm talking about everyone else -- those standing on the outside looking in, full of judgements. Why are we so shocked that adultery occurs, and that marriage -- especially a long marriage -- can be haunted by a partner's attraction to someone else?People view the ""sin"" of infidelity with such fury that it brings about all sorts of ruin from outside the marriage, regardless of how the couple chooses to deal with it. It is viewed with such condemnation that the couple doesn't even get to choose their own course of action; the public does it for them -- people who don't have to live with the consequences. Is this necessary, or even right?There are about 121 million married and cohabitating Americans right now, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If I had to guess, I would wager that infidelity has, in one way or another, affected about 120 million of them -- even if it's just through a neighbor, or a friend, or a physics professor or an actor or a movie watched on a Saturday night. If this is true for even a fraction of married America, it seems like it would be smarter to punt the scorched-earth policy towards adultery and allow, instead, for a moment of pause. Adultery is so firmly attached to the ideas of sin and damnation that no one wants to go over there for a closer look, which is a missed opportunity. There is the larger issue of why people have affairs. It makes sense to grapple with that once in awhile, if only to flex our own marital perspectives. I have grappled with infidelity from both sides, as betrayer and as betrayed. So I know that the why deserves more scrutiny than it gets. Sadly, it is one of those issues like alcoholism or gambling or teenage pregnancy that -- wag your finger at it all you want -- happens nonetheless.Not everyone who commits adultery is a demon. Not everyone who remains true is a saint, or even necessarily a good spouse. Monogamy is a challenge for many adults. It was a huge one for me, and for my husband. There is much to be weighed during a commitment of decades. There are the promises, the circumstances surrounding them, the beauty of the union versus a natural inclination to others, the happiness of the marriage versus the happiness you suspect is available elsewhere.It is a rare spouse who never, for one moment, considers the tidal pull of another. That consideration is painful for both, even if nothing happens. But when it does happen, does it really need to be fatal? Having been through both ends of adultery, I think divorce is a lot worse than recovering from a spouse's affair. I do not think there should be more infidelity. I just think there should be less divorce because of it.This is not an argument for betrayal. It is just a solicitation, if that's the word, for more understanding. And some serious reflection about why we pile so many expectations onto the fragile back of marriage. When those expectations are dashed, we react by condemning the cheater and yanking their achievements -- no matter how justifiably earned -- out from under them. General David Petraeus provides just the most recent example of our collective wrath towards cheaters. His storied career was over within hours of the revelation. That is too pre-emptive for someone like me. But it really should be too pre-emptive for everyone else, too.I wonder if there isn't a better way of dealing with the lure of infidelity apart from the single refrain, ""Don't do it!"" Adultery happens anyway, often and everywhere.There are so many reasons given for it. Boredom. Sex. Loneliness. A longing for connection. Some of them are fair reasons. But in the case of long marriage, I wonder if infidelity isn't simply a matter of wanting to feel again the way you did when you first fell in love. Sometimes it is difficult to imagine you will never feel that level of passion again, or extend it to anyone else. That is a lot to give up forever. Monogamy has to be worth it. It isn't, always.We use the phrase ""teachable moment"" in reference to the lessons that arise for our children about bullying or fighting with siblings or sharing their toys. Infidelity is a big issue for married people along the same lines. The prevalence of it in our culture and in our lives could be considered a teachable moment for the adults in the room.As for the why of infidelity, that is for every coupled adult to puzzle through. Considering the millions of marriages and couples out there, that is a lot of potential whys. And about that many answers, too, all of them useful as cautionary tales to take up and read and learn from if ever we are shocked to the point of awe by our own circumstances.WATCH:"

4,DIVORCE,Divorce Research: Study Finds That Children Of Divorce Are More Likely To Smoke,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/divorce-research_us_5b9ceeb8e4b03a1dcc830c26,Lead author Esme Fuller-Thomson and her co-researchers acknowledged that the link between parental divorce and smoking could,2013-03-14,Couples Who Share Housework Are More Likely To Divorce,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a96fd22a000028007af6fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"According to a new University of Toronto study, children of divorce are more likely to start smoking than those who grow up with married parents.The study -- published online this month in the journal Public Health -- found that men whose parents divorced before their sons turned 18 had 48 percent higher odds of ever smoking 100 cigarettes or more in their lifetime than men whose parents stayed married. Women whose parents had split had 39 percent higher odds of taking up smoking. Lead author Esme Fuller-Thomson and her co-researchers acknowledged that the link between parental divorce and smoking could be attributed to other factors that might affect kids of divorce, such as lower levels of education and income as adults, mental disorders such as depression and anxiety and other traumatic childhood events such as abuse or parental addiction. ""However, even when we took all these factors into account, a strong and significant association between parental divorce and smoking remained,"" Fuller-Thomson said in a press release. Researchers did not pinpoint why children of divorce are more likely to take up smoking. But doctoral student and co-author of the study, Joanne Filippelli, speculated that these kids ""may use smoking as a coping mechanism to regulate emotions and stress. Some research suggests this calming effect may be particularly attractive to those who have suffered early adversities.”The study looked at a group of more than 19,000 men and women who were ages 18 and older. Of that group, 1,551 were male children of divorce and 2,382 were female children of divorce.
