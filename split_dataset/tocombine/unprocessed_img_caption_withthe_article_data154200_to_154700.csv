0,PARENTING,Why Merida Matters,"Lauren Boyle, Contributor
Enthusiast in general",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-merida-matters_us_5b9d2d24e4b03a1dcc85331c,"The original image of Merida was precious and clung to by moms who adored Merida for her adventures, her love of her family, and her resemblance to the young girls they know and love.",2013-05-21,"LAKE BUENA VISTA, FL - MAY 11: The brave and passionate Merida arrives at her royal celebration as Gabby Douglas and her mom Natalie Hawkins join in on the festivities during a royal celebration at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort in conjunction with Mother's Day festivities on May 11, 2013 in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. (Photo by Gerardo Mora/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2d242400005000537b19.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Who is Merida? She's the soft-hearted but strong-willed protagonist from the Disney/Pixar film Brave. With her penchant for archery and sword-fighting, I'd put money on her as the victor in any Disney Princess Battle Royale. (The only one that might give her trouble would be Mulan).This month, Disney announced that 16-year-old Merida would join the ranks of the Disney princesses. Suddenly, a drawing of Merida in more formal -- and markedly more sexual -- attire appeared. Her bow and arrow had gone missing, her unruly curls had been tamed, her eye makeup painted on and her waist tapered down. Even her facial expression, a smirk, seemed to say ""come hither"" in a way that 16-year-old monarchs should probably not be saying.A public condemnation from Brave director Amy Chapman and 220,000 signatures on a change.org petition later, it appeared as if Disney's would-be consumers and Merida fans had won. Disney released a statement that claimed the new drawing of Merida in her ""party dress"" had been merely a celebration of her coronation, and that her original likeness had not been erased from Disneyworld or the Disney Princess homepage.Disney also made it clear, however, that the more ""mature"" and sexualized image of Merida isn't going away. She still appears on Target's website and will be featured in some lines of merchandise.I suppose I shouldn't expect much from a company who made its fortune peddling the stories of Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty as ideal, wholesome, coming-of-age stories for young ladies. Snow White features a queen who will literally murder people to be considered the most beautiful, and Snow White requires the help of eight men to function on a daily basis. Cinderella and her Prince are no more than drunk college students at a party: She's losing her shoes, he can't remember her face, the whole thing's a mess. And Aurora from Sleeping Beauty essentially transmits the message that sexual contact with a sleeping girl who can't consent is the stuff of pure romance.But for Disney to dismiss this image of Merida as a breezy ""celebration"" is a dismissal of the influence of these images in the lives of young girls. As an educator, I witness the reality of the power of media images all too often at the high school where I work. Young ladies -- and young gentlemen -- internalize what they see, and they lack the media literacy skills to safely dissect it and to realize when Disney and other multi-billion dollar companies are feeding them nonsense. We surround these children -- yes, they are still children -- with images and songs revolving around sex and money, and then we condemn them for their premature sexual behavior and appearances. You try telling a young freshman girl not to wear the tightest jeans she can find and a blouse that doesn't show her bra, when her pink binder and, likely, her room, are plastered with photos of models wearing nothing but a string bikini and stilettos. She might not be able to hear you, when the music she listens to contains subject matter almost exclusively limited to strippers, sex and money.Few and far between are the age-appropriate images of adolescent girls: girls who dream, who read, who are not yet interested in the opposite sex, who may not have yet physically developed. The original image of Merida, then, was precious and clung to by moms who adored Merida for her adventures, her love of her family, and her resemblance to the young girls they know and love. Yet even the Princesses, a group of young women who are notoriously pure -- or, at least, so claims Disney -- are not safe from sexualization. Judging by the content of our media, we want young women who are content with eye makeup and not adventures, to wear the party dress, but not to brandish the bow and arrow. The issue extends much further than Merida and Disney, but Merida serves as an allegory of a larger movement in American media to sexualize the young adolescent girl. To me, for this reason, all the outcry over an animated character serves a deeper purpose: to at least hold multi-billion dollar corporations without consciences like Disney accountable to answer for their choices, if we cannot compel them to change."
1,WEDDINGS,Green Your Honeymoon,"Paula Conway, Contributor

Put your money where your heart is and get away with your new spouse to a romantic destination where the preserving the natural surroundings is the top priority.,2013-05-21,"Giraffe herd in silhouette against sunset (Giraffa camelopardalis), Botswana, South Africa",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2e532200003000d986bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Got a passion for the environment? Put your money where your heart is and get away with your new spouse to a romantic destination where the preserving the natural surroundings is the top priority. Fortunately we live in an age where a green honeymoon can bring you back to nature without sacrificing the creature comforts of a modern resort. These four properties prove there's something enduringly romantic about the great outdoors:Luxury Safari Located smack-dab in the middle of a wildebeest migration path on the Serengeti, the Singita Grumeti reserve is about as far from civilization as possible. Yet the creature comforts of home remain: Its most back-to-basics experience, Singita Explore, marries fine wine and canvas tents, buffet breakfasts and African safaris. This exclusive mobile camp treads lightly over 340,000 private acres, with the dual goals of putting you in touch with the wilderness and making minimal impact on the environment. The camp, consisting of six tents and two mess halls, is almost completely solar-powered (there's one electrical outlet in the mess tent) and designed for minimal energy consumption. Attendants bring water to the camp site, where they fill up two 3,000-liter water tanks used as a bucket system to deliver water to the tents. Water for the showers is heated using a volcano pressure boiler, fueled by recycled green energy. The rugged, natural aesthetic extends to the canvas walls lining each tent, which are filled with furnishings of steel, leather, rubber and natural fabrics. Singita's stellar service has earned numerous awards and worldwide recognition, apparent from the moment your pre-ordered dietary choices are imported to your plate. It's proof that camping doesn't have to mean ""roughing it.""Wind (And Star) PowerFor two weeks in January, Sundance Resort is teeming with moviegoers, actors and filmmakers. The rest of the year it's a quiet, back-country luxury hideout with sweeping views of the Wasatch Mountains. Year-round, the resort is buying up wind power at a rapid pace -- more than 2.7 million kilowatt-hours of wind-generated electricity each year, enough to offset 100 percent of its energy use. Sundance ditched Butch Cassidy to partner with Renewable Choice, whose renewable energy credits (RECs) are third-party certified by Green-e Energy. Ever since Robert Redford purchased the property in 1969, other various ""green"" practices have been enforced. Currently, we're fans of the organic soap, which is made on-site. The one-bedroom cottages are a warm respite from the winter cold, but you might want to splurge on one of Sundance's luxury mountain homes. These 2-, 3-, 4- or 7-bedroom cabins come with a full kitchen, deck, hot tub and game room, and a private butler, chef or nanny upon request.Patagonian ParadiseThe best ideas stand the test of time: The uniquely designed dome lodges at EcoCamp Patagonia are inspired by the Kaweskars, a group of nomadic Patagonian inhabitants who roamed the Torres del Paine region of Chile as early as the 15th century. Their circular huts were as easy to break down as to build up, and so are the semi-spherical structures currently dotting the Estancia Cerro Paine -- the only private property in Torres del Paine National Park. (The whole EcoCamp packed up and moved here in 2005.) The certified eco-friendly accommodations are as cozy as they are carbon-free. A wood-burning stove, hot shower and dining room with delicious food and wine blows away anything you experienced in summer camps as a kid. An ideal combination of adventure with a romantic getaway or honeymoon. Confidential tip: Plan ahead for a back-to-basics experience. Electricity is limited and only available to guests for charging camera batteries and laptops, not for using hairdryers. Solar energy is most efficient during the off-peak summer season.Go Green Down UnderThe marriage of a resort and the untouched outback sets the stage for every wedding at Australia's Capella Lodge. Located on World Heritage-listed Lord Howe Island two hours from Sydney, an idyllic setting is guaranteed because no more than 400 people are allowed on the island at a time. Revegetation of two acres of land surrounding the lodge are ongoing, in which endemic species are planted to prevent erosion. Naturalist guides on site provide expert interpretive experiences for guests, building awareness of the natural environment. Solar glazing captures sunlight and stores natural heat, and there's no air conditioning in the nine suites -- made possible (and comfortable) by a subtropical climate. If you want to feel ""at one"" with your significant other and nature, this is the place. Rare birds, plants, geology and marine life are everywhere. Seventy-five percent of the island is preserved through a permanent park, including a rainforest and a pristine beach that's perfect for exchanging vows."
2,PARENTING,Over-Parenting Can Do More Harm Than Not Enough,"Tim Elmore, Contributor

That's a no brainer. What we've failed to see for two decades is that over-parenting -- not under-parenting -- can do even more harm.,2013-05-21,Girl with blonde hair playing with her mother under cubbyhouse.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2d452200005700d98639.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Everyone agrees that it's a crime to neglect a child. That's a no brainer. What we've failed to see for two decades is that over-parenting -- not under-parenting -- can do even more harm. Psychologists have found that a kid without an attentive parent can be emotionally damaged -- but soon discover they must find a way to fend for themselves. Children from over-parented homes can just plain fail to develop at all.The Bully IssueDieter Wolke, Ph.D, Professor of Developmental Psychology at The University of Warwick Medical School in the UK, and lead author of this study, gives a practical example of how this plays out: ""Overprotection by parents can increase the risk a child will be bullied."" According to the study published last week in Child Abuse & Neglect, researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 70 studies on more than 200,000 children. ""Since parental support and supervision are important aspects to prevent bullying, the researchers were particularly surprised to find that over-protective parenting can have adverse effects on children. Parents who try too hard to buffer their children from harm, they assessed, can actually hurt them.""The goal of parenting, Dr. Wolke suggests, is to make children competent, self-regulating, and effective people. ""Children need to deal with various forms of stress in mild doses -- like an inoculation that helps the body to fight a real infection by having built antibodies. Similarly, children do need to experience some conflict to learn how to deal with larger problems, such as bullying.""Five Action StepsSo, what's the answer? Either extreme -- abandonment or abundance -- is wrong. So how do we nurture young people, but not over-do it? The parents and teachers I know who equip students to handle bullying and other difficulties on campus practice the following action steps:1. Teach your kids problem solving skills.Instead of conditioning our young people to ""depend on parents"" to fix what's wrong, why not cultivate a ""problem-solving bias"" in them, to understand and resolve their problems -- whether it's a low test score, a bully on the bus, or a deadline they can't meet. This builds a can-do attitude in them, a resilient spirit as they encounter challenges and it prepares them for life.2. Discuss the art of negotiation.Much of life is about negotiating conflict with others and resolving it with a win/win solution or a compromise. I've spent years talking to my son, Jonathan, about negotiating conflict with difficult peers when they disagreed or with teachers when an assignment seemed impossible. This deepens their logic, empathy and ability to communicate. It's a skill they will use the rest of their lives. 3. Build emotional intelligence in your kids.EQ, not IQ, is the greatest predictor of success for young people, both as students and later as graduates. Emotional intelligence enables a person to be self-aware; to manage their own emotions; to be socially aware (how are people connected or disconnected with each other) and to manage relationships. When we build healthy EQ in our kids, we prepare them to be more resilient. (Note: we're currently creating two new books called Habitudes and Emotional Intelligence). 4. Help them set and manage expectations.I believe that much of life is about setting and managing healthy, realistic expectations. Kids become unhealthy when they just can't seem to navigate what to expect (or feel entitled to) and the reality they face. For example, while we wish everyone was kind and empathetic, even grown adults can be... uh, well, immature. Prepare your kids for hardship; tell them life can be tough. It's normal. 5. Don't do it for them.Whatever you do, as your kids grow older, move from ""doing it for them"" to ""helping them learn to do it themselves."" Don't give them a fish; teach them to fish. By age 10, when they can't finish a project or meet a deadline, or make a practice, have them call their teacher or coach. Teach them to apologize for mistakes. If need be, go to the teacher with them, even hold their hand, but have them do the talking. It works."

About a week into the process I learned something: I really don't like drinking the carbonated substitute. That said, I did find several new uses for seltzer around the house. Here are some of my favorites.1. Counter Cleaner Seltzer's mild acidity makes it a great counter cleaner -- especially if you're concerned about using stronger chemical sprays. The beverage's acidity is just strong enough to help break down dirt and grime on your kitchen counters, stainless steel fixtures and even porcelain sinks.  Photo by Shutterstock  2. Hair Cleaner This trick is especially useful in the summer months, as the chlorine in pools and the saltwater from the beach do some damage on our hair. Rinsing your hair with seltzer (using either half a cup or a full cup depending on how long your hair is) after a day at the beach or pool will help remove any buildup on your follicles.  Photo by Shutterstock  3. Waffles/Pancakes Swap out the water for seltzer when you're making waffles and pancakes. The carbonation produces light and fluffy breakfast staples. This works especially well when you're using a waffle maker.  Photo by Shutterstock  4. Stain Remover Did you wind up spilling food on your clothes while at the office? Don't worry. Go to the vending machine and get some seltzer and pour directly onto the stain; the carbonation and mild acidity will help break down the blemish. After a gentle scrubbing, it will be as good as new!  Photo by Robert Hruzek/Flickr5. Newspaper Preserver Take Care Of Your Stuff shares a way to preserve newspaper using only seltzer water and milk of magnesia. This is a great trick for home archivists or genealogists.
