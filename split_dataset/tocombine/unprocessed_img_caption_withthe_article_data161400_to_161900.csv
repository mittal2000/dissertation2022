Physically ill. Like someone had knocked the air from my chest,"" Amy Cheney wrote on the website Mamamia. Cheney said she found the diet list alongside her daughter's Polly Pockets and friendship bracelets, but it is the girl's spelling that poignantly highlights just how young she is. Among the foods the girl was allowing herself to eat were:- ""appals"" -""keewee"" -""yoget""The exercises on the list included:-""pooshups""  -""16 star jumps 2 time a day"" -""rid my bike 3 time a day""In her post, Cheney noted her daughter said she had learned about dieting from a 7-year-old friend.Visit Mamamia to read Cheney's full post.Though a 7-year-old conceiving of her own diet might sound unusual, a 2009 study from the University of Florida found that of 121 girls aged 3 through 6, nearly half admitted they worry about being fat.A recent study from Texas A & M also suggests that Cheney's daughter's decision to take up a diet after hearing about it from a friend isn't altogether surprising. Researchers found that peer competition may contribute more significantly to adolescents adopting negative perceptions about their bodies than the media does. There are also rare cases of children showing signs of anorexia as early as kindergarten. ABC News recently recounted a story about a kindergartner who confessed to her mother that she was always hungry.""Mommy, I have a problem … I am hungry all the time and I can't eat,"" the girl reportedly told her mother, according to ABC News. ""A voice in my head is telling me not to eat.""Still, the cultural resistance to children worrying about their weight seems to remain strong. For example, after mom Dara-Lynn Weiss wrote a piece for Vogue about putting her 7-year-old on a diet, the backlash was fierce, to say the least.(h/t Buzzfeed)"

AFP PHOTO / GERARD JULIEN (Photo credit should read GERARD JULIEN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce5fc2100003000c54ed2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sari Kamin HRN StafferSo our friends over in Europe found out they've been eating their beef with a heavy dose of horse in it. ""No thanks,"" we here in the U.S. think, scarfing down our burgers with a side of freedom fries. Most Americans couldn't fathom eating horse and pity our friends across the pond who - surprise! - have been feasting on potpies filled with a new kind of secret. The Brits are unhappy as we are to discover the mystery in their meat has finally been solved and his name is Seabiscuit.Folks in Ireland and Britain are far more disturbed by the culinary taboo of eating horse than many of their neighbors (I'm looking at you, France!) who consume far more of those four-legged friends. Not to say that folks in France, Sweden, Poland and other affected countries aren't in a tizzy - they are, but not necessarily for the same reasons. Taboos are a funny thing, and when it comes to breaking them, certainly not all food cultures are alike. In the United States we eat predominantly beef, chicken, and pork. In Muslim countries, pork is verboten. In Hindu cultures, beef is shunned. In parts of Asia, dog is consumed and thought to be good for strength and sexual vitality. In most Western nations, dogs are our best friends. So chew on this: While it may certainly be tempting to respond with shock and disgust when others eat foods we consider strange, it is important to remember that long-held cultural traditions are extremely significant in the way that individual nations think about food. In the countries affected by the horse meat scandal, transparency is as much an issue as is taboo. In this instance, the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" is being violated. Beef costs more than horse, so by using horse meat as a filler or even a complete replacement is saving meat companies a lot of money. We're being served up a mare in a bovine's clothing, allowing the beef companies to save a ton of cash and the cost of 100% beef products.So, money is an issue. So are drugs. Horses are notoriously filled with steroids and other chemicals, especially those who had been used for racing before being shipped to the slaughterhouses. As my professor, the esteemed Dr. Marion Nestle said in class last week, ""horses are so full of drugs, they're worse that that biking guy."" It's funny because it's true. The most auspicious of the drugs being used is phenylbutazone, banned for any human use in the U.S. and used routinely to treat horses for pain relief. Among a very a long list of human side effects are bone marrow suppression, internal bleeding, and liver toxicity. Kidney pie, anyone?If you look at the American reaction to the horse meat outbreak, it becomes very clear that when we eat processed foods, we just can't quite know for sure what we're getting, but we should. Here in the United States, a country that recently saw California defeat the proposition to demand GMO labeling, we are aghast to see that Taco Bells in Britain have discovered horse meat in their Gordita Supremes®. That's a restaurant whose spokesperson was a Spanish-speaking Chihuahua for 16 years! Yo no quiero!Ikea's across Europe have been retracting their balls ever since equine DNA was found in their beef. The furniture mega-chain has filed suit against their Swedish meat supplier who purchased the meat from two separate slaughterhouses in Poland. This just goes to show that the supply chain of processed meat is more complex than assembling one of Ikea's dressers!  McDonalds has been gloating over the fact that none of its beef has tested positive for horse, but this revelation comes only one year after Jamie Oliver exposed their fondness for a certain treated meat product known as ""pink slime."" Before we get all smug about our American beef, I suggest we all get off our high horses (pun intended) and recognize the fact that we don't know when we are eating GMO foods (unless it is organic) or meat or dairy that comes from cows treated with growth hormones.So what is it about horsemeat that has Americans having such a cow? Well, I think it's a little bit of everything - the notion of eating such a beautiful animal that we consider domestic and friendly; the idea that we're being cheated by corporations; and also, when we get down to it, the fear. It makes us fear that it could happen to us. What's even scarier is that it probably is happening in the U.S., and we just haven't tested for it yet here. I think and I hope that we will learn a lesson by this event, and that is to demand to know what is in our food. The FDA needs more stringent labeling regulations. Europe is much less forgiving when it comes to GMOs and it just doesn't make sense that we have no policy on this matter at all. (To learn more about GMO labeling in the United States, check out the interview on Heritage Radio Network that executive director Erin Fairbanks did with Jim Gerritsen, President of the Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association.)The other lesson is that if you eat processed foods there is a good chance you won't have access to all of the ingredients.Here at Heritage Radio Network, we recommend eating as much home-cooked, organic, grass-fed, cage-free, local, and free-range food as possible. Of course it is not always realistic to maintain these standards, but if we do the best we can while demanding that the government give us the transparency we deserve, then we might not want to run to the border so much, because we'll be doing fine right where we are.Find out how to eat real, unprocessed foods and much more at heritageradionetwork.org"
4,WELLNESS,Pandemrix: FDA Weighs Approval Of Narcolepsy-Linked Flu Vaccine In US,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/narcolepsy-link-to-glaxo_us_5b9ce730e4b03a1dcc82d7af,"The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendation of its advisory panel, though it typically does. According to GSK, some",2013-03-07,"Syringes filled with the vaccine Pandemrix can be seen in the newly established 'vaccination street' in Wiesbaden, southewestern Germany on October 26, 2009. The vaccination programme against swine flu started on October 26, 2009 in Germany primarily for at-risk groups like employees of the health and security sector. In the following week pregnant women as well as chronically ill people will be immunised, said a spokesperson of the Thuringian Health Ministry. AFP PHOTO DDP / THOMAS LOHNES GERMANY OUT (Photo credit should read THOMAS LOHNES/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce7302200005700d96c2f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Toni ClarkeMarch 7 (Reuters) - Growing evidence of a link between GlaxoSmithKline Plc's pandemic flu vaccine and an increase in narcolepsy cases among children who received it in Europe, is giving pause to health regulators weighing approval of a similar vaccine in the United States.Data published recently in the British Medical Journal found that children in England who received GSK's Pandemrix vaccine during the 2009-10 H1N1 swine flu pandemic had a 14-fold heightened risk of developing narcolepsy, a chronic and potentially debilitating sleep disorder that can cause hallucinations, daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, a form of muscle weakness precipitated by strong emotion.Authors of the study - whose results echo those of similar studies in Sweden, Finland and Ireland - said the data had implications for the approval and use of future vaccines that, like Pandemrix, contain AS03, a new adjuvant, or booster, that turbo-charges the body's immune response to the vaccine.Scientists believe AS03 may be the culprit in the narcolepsy cases though they have yet to decipher the precise nature of the association.That uncertainty poses a challenge for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is considering an AS03-containing vaccine for use in the event of an H5N1 bird flu epidemic. Like Pandemrix, which has not been approved in the United States, it is made by GSK and is almost identical in structure.A 14-member panel of advisors to the FDA voted unanimously in November to recommend the vaccine to protect against bird flu. The panel considered early studies from Europe showing an increase in the number of narcolepsy cases but concluded that the potential benefit of the vaccine outweighed the risk. WORSE THAN THOUGHT?Since then, however, new data, including the study results from Britain, suggest the scale and strength of the narcolepsy link could be greater than first thought. At least one committee member would like the FDA to reconvene the panel.""I personally think the panel should be reconvened now that we have new data,"" said Dr. Ambrose Cheung, professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. ""This is an issue worth re-examining.""According to GSK, some 30 million doses of the vaccine were administered across Europe and 800 people, mostly children, developed narcolepsy. While acknowledging an association, the company says there is insufficient evidence to prove Pandemrix is the cause.A new meeting of the advisory committee would not necessarily lead panelists to change their vote. Bird flu kills nearly 60 percent of those it infects. As a result, the imperative to find a vaccine is high.""This is an evolving situation so there will continue to be more information to inform the decision making process,"" said advisory committee member Dr. Melinda Wharton, acting director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).""Given that, I think this is a situation where the risk/benefit assessment could still favor the use of the vaccine, particularly in adults, as we are looking at a disease with an extremely high mortality rate.""The CDC is sponsoring an international study on the links between adjuvanted flu vaccines and narcolepsy, which is expected to be completed in 2014. HIGHER MORTALITY RATEThe H5N1 bird flu virus was first isolated in a human in Hong Kong in 1997 and it began to spread throughout Southeast Asia in 2003.A 2011 report by the World Health Organization showed only 566 people have been infected with bird flu worldwide, against the millions infected with the 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus.However, bird flu has a significantly higher mortality rate; of those infected, 59 percent died, according to WHO. That compares with fewer than 1 percent of those infected with H1N1 who have lost their lives, which alters the equation for the FDA versus the European regulators who authorized Pandemrix for the H1N1 virus.""We gave a favorable vote to a vaccine that we hope will never be used and to protect the public against a disease that has a better than 50 percent mortality rate,"" said Dr. Robert Daum, chairman of the FDA's advisory committee and a professor of pediatrics, microbiology and molecular medicine at the University of Chicago. ""That is a very special situation.""Still, Daum said he welcomed the opportunity to discuss any new information if the FDA were to reconvene the panel.""I have had several discussions with FDA personnel about the issue of adjuvanted vaccines and there are many unanswered questions,"" he said. ""If they came to us and said we would like you to reconvene and consider the new data, I'd be in favor.""FDA officials declined to be interviewed.A spokeswoman, Rita Chappelle, said in a statement that the FDA ""will continue to monitor the situation, and consider regulatory options as needed.""The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendation of its advisory panel, though it typically does. NEW ADJUVANTSRegardless of whether the bird flu vaccine is approved for use in the United States, the narcolepsy issue has raised concerns within the broader scientific community about the future of novel adjuvants.""We are taking this very seriously,"" said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, director of the vaccine research program at Vanderbilt University, who did not sit on the bird flu vaccine panel though she has served on FDA advisory panels in the past. ""We would like to understand this.""Adjuvants have been used in vaccines for diseases such as diphtheria and tetanus for decades. A new, more powerful generation of adjuvants, including AS03, is being developed whose safety is relatively untested, which is why the Pandemrix experience could be pivotal.""The whole adjuvant story is an important one because there are going to be vaccines that we may be able to use to prevent diseases, if we are able to use adjuvants, that we could not prevent otherwise,"" Edwards said.Edwards said U.S. experts felt that traditional, non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines made by Sanofi SA and others offered enough protection against the virus. A study by the CDC showed traditional vaccines have not been associated with any spike in the number of people with narcolepsy.In the case of bird flu, however, regulators currently have no other choices as scientists have not developed a vaccine capable of protecting against bird flu.GSK's super-charged vaccine is the first to show it can confer protection and could potentially save countless lives in the event of a pandemic. European regulators have approved it under the brand name Pumarix.Assessing the relative risk versus benefit is a complex task and the calculation can change over time. Scientists are only just beginning to investigate the long-term effects of Pandemrix.Narcolepsy is widely considered to be an autoimmune disease, in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own organs. One question now being raised by scientists is whether Pandemrix may be associated over the long term with an increase in other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and lupus.Indeed, the FDA panel, which looked to the Pandemrix data for clues on the safety of the bird flu vaccine, noted a slightly elevated number of cases of irritable bowel syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, said Cheung. But the panel felt these events could easily have been due to chance.""These kind of events,"" Cheung said, ""can only be addressed after a longer period of time."""

6,FOOD & DRINK,Watered-Down Budweiser Tastes A Lot Like Normal Bud In Blind Tasting,Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/watered-down-budweiser_us_5b9ce6f9e4b03a1dcc82d412,"After claims that Budweiser has been ""watered down,"" we set up an experiment to see if drinkers can really tell the difference.",2013-03-07,"NEW YORK, NY - FEBRUARY 27: A can of Budweiser beer is displayed in a kiosk in Grand Central Terminal on February 27, 2013 in New York City. In a new class action lawsuit against Anheuser-Busch, beer enthusiasts have accused the company of watering down its Budweiser, Michelob and other beers. The suits, which were filed in Pennsylvania, California and other states, are seeking millions in damages for allegedly cheating customers out of the alcohol content stated on labels. Anheuser-Busch calls the suit groundless. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce6f92100003000c54f24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, a group of beer drinkers filed a class action lawsuit against Anheuser-Busch InBev, claiming that the brewing giant had ""watered down"" its blockbuster beers Budweiser and Michelob to save money. Anheuser-Busch responded by taking out full-page ads in 10 major newspapers disputing the claim. NPR backed the company up by testing the beers for alcohol content and finding they were just as strong as the packaging said they were.But that got us thinking: What did the plaintiffs really mean by ""watered down""? Alcohol content may be the central issue in court -- whether Anheuser-Busch labeling has misled customers about the beers' alcohol content and run afoul of truth-in-advertising laws. But for beer drinkers, taste seems just as important. To find out whether the average drinker would be able to tell if Anheuser-Busch were watering down its beer, we decided to conduct a little experiment. We mixed cans of Budweiser with amounts of seltzer ranging from zero to three ounces, to ""water down"" the beer without compromising carbonation, and then had 10 HuffPost staffers (including the author of this post) taste the beverages to see if they could determine which had been the most diluted.And the results? We pretty much couldn't tell when the Bud had been watered down. The tasters ranked the seven samples of beer from least watered-down to most, and they failed miserably. Only two of the 10 tasters correctly identified the beer with no seltzer in it -- which isn't much better than the group would have done if they'd been picking a beer at random. Two other tasters said they thought the most diluted beer, the one that was 20 percent seltzer, was the least diluted one. The average ranking assigned to each beer loosely correlated with its level of dilution: The tasters could broadly tell which beers tended to be more diluted. But when it came to putting the drinks in order, they didn't do very well. In other words, they thought that undiluted beer was more diluted than it was and that diluted beer was less diluted than it was. The average taster was off in his or her rankings of the beers by 1.7 spaces in either direction; you'd expect someone picking at random to be off by about 2.3 places, so the tasters didn't do much better. Of course, 10 people isn't exactly a statistically significant sample, so it's possible that HuffPost staffers are unusually bad at recognizing watered-down Bud. And our test has no bearing whatsoever on whether Anheuser-Busch is actually watering down its beer. But our test suggests that if the company were to start watering down its beer, we might not notice until we were 10 drinks in and still not drunk. No wonder sales of Bud and Michelob haven't dropped since news of the lawsuit hit."

Single parents often see that goal as unreachable when they factor in their parental responsibilities. Being a mommy myself, I understand the demands of parenthood. While I definitely advocate putting your children first and avoiding getting new flings involved in your kids' lives until you know they are the real deal, some single parents get the false impression that their dating lives are over until their kids turn 18. In my opinion, there are many reasons why having kids can actually improve your chances of finding love again. 1. You're a great listener. According to Thomas Haller and Chick Moorman of Uncommon-Parenting.com, ""the old adage 'Children should be seen and not heard' is not one that many parents today espouse. Most parents would agree that children need a voice at every stage of their development."" When we become accustomed to hearing our children's voices and understanding their point of view, we get the added benefit of also becoming stronger communicators outside the home. The best way to make a great impression on a date is to be a great listener, which means not only hearing your date, but also asking follow-up questions and responding to what they say. 2. You understand compromise. Ever tried to force a 2-year-old to get into their car seat? It probably ended up in a screaming fit or a game of tug-of-war. I have had to learn to be patient with my daughter and offer her compromises in return for taking actions that I need her to do, even if she doesn't want to do them. A solid relationship is built upon communication and compromise, so if you've mastered this skill with your child, you are well on your way to forming a healthy relationship.3. You don't have a lot of time to waste. Parents are busy. They can't say yes to every coffee date invitation that they get on Match.com (as I would usually recommend for my childless clients). This means that you make smart selections about who to go out with. Parents must choose who they spend their time with wisely, and this means that you will generally make better selections and connect with people that have the most relationship potential.4. You are comfortable in your body. Once you've birthed a child, you lose a lot of inhibitions about people seeing you naked. Dads also get more comfortable after tapping into their inner child on playdates. After you've had to wear face paint or a tutu at your child's behest, any trace of vanity that you once had tends to disappear. When you feel good in your own skin, others take notice and your attractiveness factor will soar.5. Shared custody gives you date nights. As much as you might miss your kids when your ex has them for the evening, the freedom of being able to do whatever you want, come home when you choose, and stay up past your usual bedtime is freeing. Knowing, in advance, that you have certain nights free can help you maximize your dating time. Plus, when you have your kids, you can leave your date wanting more and play a little hard-to-get. Your next date will be even sexier when absence has made your hearts grow fonder.If you need help getting your groove back, claim your free profile evaluation here and get on track before your kids graduate from college."

And let me tell you, cancer is a huge, HUGE topic in the media. Up until a week ago, I spent far too much of my energy avoiding it. Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. So many movies, books, TV shows, and news stories have plots or sub-plots related to cancer. Even hospital scenes were hard for me to watch or read about, after spending so much time in and out of one. It wasn't that I wanted to see something so painfully familiar to me. The real reason was that I didn't want to see something unfamiliar. I didn't want to get a wrong impression of how potentially easy or hard cancer was going to be for me by watching movies. Those stories, from what I'd seen before, were either super-heartbreaking or super-uplifting. There was no middle ground. And while I was hoping for an outcome very much like those uplifting ones, where the patients keep their hair and don't ever feel nauseous and still look movie-star gorgeous in a hospital gown, I knew that wasn't reality. So I just avoided all forms of cancer in the media for three months.It was hard. There were times where I'd start watching something and be surprised to discover (or remember, in the case of re-watching movies) that there was a sub-plot involving illness, or cancer specifically. I didn't even try to stomach it in most cases -- I'd just turn it off and find something else to watch. When that wasn't an option, I'd just automatically tear up and let myself cry over it, whether it was sad or not. The act of focusing on crying kept me from actually watching the cancer-related parts, and I was fine after half an hour or so. It happened all too often that I'd turn something off or skip over it entirely, claiming I ""couldn't handle it."" A week ago, I made the decision (after weeks of my friends nagging me to watch it) to sit through all of 50/50. For those who haven't seen it, the movie centers around 27-year-old radio writer Adam's life and how it's turned upside-down by a rare malignant tumor that's wrapped around his spine. He undergoes chemotherapy and surgery, deals with a difficult romantic relationship, and struggles with his family and friends throughout his months as a cancer patient. I was nervous to watch it at first, but I reminded myself that I was done with chemotherapy, and with surgery. All of that was behind me.In that hundred minutes of watching, I was transported back to my days in the hospital, in the doctor's office, on my parents' couch, and out with friends and family between treatments. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of a cancer patient is super realistic, and, oddly enough, charmingly humorous. It's quite a feat to make cancer funny, and Will Reiser, the screenwriter who based the story off his own fight with cancer, accomplished it beautifully. The scene before Adam goes into surgery had me absolutely bawling -- I know what it's like to be that terrified, to hug your mom while shaking with the fear that you'll never wake up to see her again. I know what it's like to wake up at 2 a.m. to hurl up the entire day's food intake. It was familiar, yet unfamiliar -- and I was okay with it.I'm not avoiding cancer in the media anymore. I've got a copy of John Green's The Fault in our Stars on my bookshelf waiting to finally be read, and I watched Grey's Anatomy just last week with no problem whatsoever. And now that I'm letting myself be exposed to cancer-related plots, I wonder if I really ever had a problem with it to start. Maybe it would have been therapeutic to watch the shows and movies and read the books, and to know that they exist because other people have suffered and survived before I did, and unfortunately many will suffer after me. Maybe I would have found solace in the stories of Laura Linney on The Big C and Monica Potter on Parenthood. But hey, it's never too late, right? I'm still a survivor -- I can still empathize and be grateful that I made it to the other side to enjoy those movies and books.So, does anyone have Season 2 of Breaking Bad on DVD for me to borrow?"
9,DIVORCE,Divorcing The Dress,"Lisa B. Samalonis, Contributor
Health writer, essayist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/divorcing-the-dress_us_5b9cdfeae4b03a1dcc829be7,"Deep down, I knew I shouldn't bring the wedding dress -- a symbol of my marital hopes -- into my new home and allow it to take up essential real estate in my closet.",2013-03-06,Young caucasian woman throwing a clothes from the wardrobe back.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdfea2500003500363e63.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I dumped the too-tight clothes, outdated computers, chunky cell phones and unused exercise equipment. I ditched unread books, old billing statements and a plethora of papers. The purging was pragmatic-- my new place would be a much smaller space than my pre-divorce home and storage units are too pricey. Did I really need every birthday card I ever received or every picture I had ever snapped during the 20 years of my now-dead relationship?Through the de-cluttering process, I grew more peaceful. With each trash load I dragged to the curb or drop I did at the donation center, my house and my possibilities expanded. Friends accepted gently used toys, books, and children's clothes. I returned an unfathomable amount unused (an unopened) products to stores, and weekly, I drove up to one of those metal bins in shopping centers and stuffed in another blessing.That thinking worked fine until I got to my wedding dress, which had been preserved in an acid-free box post-nuptials. I didn't want to keep it. I didn't think anyone would wear it again (I have sons). Yet, I continued to take it with me. The bulky box had moved from our post-wedding apartment, to our then-new four bedroom suburban colonial. After the divorce when I moved to my smaller town home, I lugged the box up the stairs and begrudgingly stashed it into a closet. Deep down, I knew I shouldn't bring the wedding dress -- a symbol of my marital hopes -- into my new home and allow it to take up essential real estate in my closet.""Sell it on ebay,"" said my savvy single friend. ""Turn heartbreak into cold hard cash.""Selling things on the internet is not my thing. I shook my head and described the day I stood before the tri-fold mirror in the store and first slipped on the iridescent sparkling sheath with its long-fitted sleeves.""It has sleeves?"" she said. ""No one wear wedding dresses with sleeves anymore. Haven't you looked in a wedding magazine lately?""Errr...no. I had been busy being married, having children, and then getting divorced. Bridal magazines did not get delivered to my mailbox. A quick call to a consignment shop told me she was right. Prim attendants politely told me that pre-2005 dresses would not sell unless they were vintage couture or had been worn by an A-list celebrity. So I thought I might give eBay at try after all. A search showed a few exquisite couture gowns (never worn!) for sale and then pages of hideous dresses, and many outdated ones like mine. Someone could buy and alter my gown but that possibility seemed less likely than a successful second marriage which studies (or at least internet lore) rank somewhere around a 60/40 split to demise.The big brown dumpster by my house started to look like a good option. I could see myself heaving that ivory box over the lip, shoving it in, and hearing the thump of the black lid. I also heard the voice of my younger self (or was it my mother?) tsking: ""Remember how much you paid for it plus alternations and the veil -- how wasteful.""The choices for removing the dress from my life seemed all too much and so I blocked it from my brain. A few months later as I switched over my spring clothes, the dress stared back at me. I had recently read in a magazine that charitable organizations collect wedding dresses, resell them, and donate the proceeds to breast cancer research. I could feel good about that, I thought. But when I checked the site, it said because of high inventory and low demand they would not take old dresses like mine.I chided myself for wasting time mulling over the fate of a dress from a day long gone. I had already moved past this, hadn't I? My new life -- although difficult at times -- flowed along and yet I still had that wedding dress in my closet.Then one morning over coffee something clicked: I would dash into the Goodwill donation center on the way to work, hand it over, and be done. It would be better than shoving it into the dumpster in a fit of rage (although that would feel good for maybe a minute) and it would be recycling, too. Approaching the center, I reminded myself I was releasing the dress for my future (and to have an empty floor in the closet.)When I pulled the rectangular box from the back seat, an older man walked to my car. ""Well, what do we have here?"" he said with a lopsided smile.""It's a wedding dress,"" I said, nudging it toward him.""My, my, we have someone here who could use it,"" he said as he looked back at the door of the center.I nodded, collected my tax receipt, and retreated to my car. As I drove away, I wondered if he said that to all the women who come to donate their old dreams. Then, I just decided to believe him, smiled, and drove to work.Lisa B.

It was from a mechanic, demanding payment for the work he had done on the baron's yacht.In 2012, the letter was found in a wall.The letter was found by a construction crew that works for Americans Alon and Betsy Kasha, whose real estate design company, A + B Kasha, has been renovating centuries-old Paris apartments for more than eight years. They have found hidden treasures in walls and ceilings, and underneath paint, wallpaper, and carpet. The finds are a piece of history, allowing a glimpse into the past and to the people who once lived in these Paris homes.Baron Arnould Thénard was a celebrated scientist, and the grandson of famous chemist, Louis Jacques Thénard, discoverer of hydrogen peroxide, namesake for Victor Hugo's Thenardier in Les Misérables and for a street in Paris, and whose name is inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.Knowing this background, I can understand the content of the letter:""I've already written several times to claim the balance due on the repairs I made ​​on your request, in March 1901, to your yacht ""STELLORA"" for which I have attached a duplicate. You are perfectly in a position to honor your commitments yet you refrain. I like to believe that you have forgotten and do not intend ill will. Therefore I am reminding you one last time of your debt and I hope you will be kind enough to spare me the trouble to inconvenience you.As a matter of fact, if this matter isn't satisfactorily resolved within eight days, I shall be forced to sue you.My honorable greetings, P. Giordan FilsBaron Thénard died at the age of 61, three years after the letter was written. There is no way of knowing if the bill was ever paid, but I have to wonder why it was hidden in the wall. Place Saint-Sulpice, ParisEach A + B Kasha apartment renovation begins with the demolition of existing plaster on walls and ceilings, in order to update wiring and plumbing, and often the removal of the walls themselves, to create a space that is more amenable to 21st century living. It is behind these walls and ceilings that surprises are found.During the demolition of this attic apartment on Boulevard Saint-Germain, a newspaper was found in the ceiling. Apartment before demolition Apartment during demolitionThe newspaper is dated May 8, 1945, also known as VE Day, or Victory in Europe Day. The headline is ""They Surrendered.""On this momentous day, World War II ended, with the surrender of the Nazi armed forces and the end of Hitler's Third Reich. You might think that the tenant was saving the newspaper for posterity...but, in fact, it was one of many newspapers being used for insulation in the ceiling!  View from Boulevard Saint-Germain apartmentTucked behind pipes, behind the wall of an apartment on rue Pré-Aux-Clercs, was an envelope marked, ""Important Documents."" What could it be?It turned out that this was one find that wasn't as exciting as they might have hoped. The envelope only contained an old contract from the electric company.Since then, the apartment has been exquisitely renovated, and the envelope was, well, thrown out. Before and after, interior of apartment on rue Pré-Aux-ClercsSometimes the surprises are architectural, like the Kasha's unexpected recent find under many coats of hideous yellow paint in this apartment on rue de Beaune.When their contractor went in to begin demolition of what was thought to be traditional plaster walls, he hesitated, and began to remove the centuries-old layers of paint. What he uncovered was the original, 19th century, perfectly preserved, oak paneling. The priceless find was instantly incorporated into the Kasha's design vision. I can't wait to see what it looks like when the paneling is restored to its original elegant state.Another hidden treasure found in the same apartment are the original ""parquet de Versailles"" floors that had been hidden under dirty green carpet. For the Kashas, these kind of finds are thrilling, and worth their weight in gold.These original timbered walls underneath a poorly-made plaster wall, found in an apartment on rue de Verneuil, were an architectural discovery that the Kashas ultimately included in the final design of the room.The ancient walls have been seamlessly blended with their updated interior, both preserving history and providing a distinctive design feature.It was in their own office, on the Left Bank of Paris, that Alon and Betsy Kasha made one of the most fascinating historical discoveries. The removal of the plaster walls revealed an unusual brick wall.The exceptionally large size of the bricks indicates that they could very likely be from the original wall that surrounded the clergy's field of the famous Saint-Germain-des-Prés church, the oldest church in Paris.It is to be expected that Paris apartments are rich with historical details: intricate ironwork, elaborately carved stone mantles, ornate cornices and rosettes and moldings, graceful arches and turrets but it is the unanticipated, initially unseen, treasures that tell the truly unique stories of the past.A + B Kasha 16 rue de l'Université Paris abkasha.com For more stories of design treasures, and a sourcebook of places to eat, stay, shop, and see around the world, see my blog.

But there are clear actions that all countries can take which will go a long way to reducing both the numbers diagnosed from cancer and deaths from the disease,"" said Harpal Kumar of the charity Cancer Research UK in a report published by the journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday.Kumar, who worked with Harold Varmus of the U.S. National Cancer Institute and others, said those actions included higher taxes on tobacco products, ensuring health workers set an example by not smoking, deglamourising the habit and protecting poor countries from increased marketing efforts by the industry.Some 12.7 million people are diagnosed with cancer every year worldwide and cancer now accounts for more than 15 percent of annual deaths globally.The World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said last year that the number of people with cancer is set to surge by more than 75 percent by 2030, with particularly sharp rises in poor countries as they adopt unhealthy ""Westernised"" lifestyles.Smoking is known to cause lung cancer - one of the most deadly forms of the disease - and also increases the of many other types including head and neck cancers, cancers of the bladder and kidneys, and breast, pancreas and colon cancer.Wednesday's report also said more needs to be done to ensure access and uptake of cancer-preventing immunisations - like the HPV vaccine against cervical cancer - is as high as it can be.It said the number of people getting these vaccines was low, including even in wealthy countries such as the United States where only a third of teenage girls are being vaccinated.GlaxoSmithKline and Merck make the only two licensed vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil, against the human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes almost all cervical cancers."

I used to be intimidated when I walked into a crowded restaurant and was told it would be a 40-minute wait. I usually assented, declined my companion's offer to get me a drink while we waited, and settled in to make idle chit-chat and play Angry Birds while checking the time on my phone every three minutes in the restaurant version of are-we-there-yet. I'd glance at the couples lingering over softly lit tables filled with beautiful dishes and wonder when it would be my turn. I wanted to be waited on. I wanted to linger. I wanted to have a capital-D Dining Experience.That began to change last summer when, in the middle of a remarkable heatwave, my husband and I slouched into The Purple Pig in Chicago on the fourth of July. We were sweating after the short walk from our hotel (you try not to sweat walking any distance at all when it's 107 out), the line was backed up way out the door, and our moods were rapidly approaching hangry. We were told the wait for a table would be, well, who knows how long, but it was longer than I was willing to wait. I glanced longingly at the couples lingering over the aforementioned softly lit tables littered with the remnants of an amazing small plates dinner. And then I heard, ""Would you like to sit at the bar? We serve the full menu.""The heavens opened up. Angels sang. The sun shone down upon us. We looked at each other, uncertain. We shrugged. And then we said yes. Sure, we're on a ""date night,"" but let's try this eating at the bar business. We strolled past a few dozen would-be diners waiting to hear their names called, and as I settled onto the barstool and took my first long sip of vinho verde (nothing better on a sweltering day, y'all), I cast a glance at them and thought, ""Haha, suckers!""At The Purple Pig, the kitchen is located right behind the bar, so we not only got to chat with the bartender and take advantage of her knowledge about the restaurant's wine list and menu, we got something of a show. As we ate, exclaiming over the fried pig's ear with crispy kale, the roasted bone marrow, and a handful of other oh-my-God-this-is-so-good dishes, the bartender heard us and jumped in, recommending her own favorites. She kept the drinks coming. We asked her to choose our dessert. Everything we tasted was amazing. And I realized that it wasn't a Dining Experience I was after, but an Eating Experience.Fast forward to late December. We're out for my birthday, smack dab in the middle of the holiday season, at The Roosevelt here in Richmond. With just 36 seats in the house, and only half available for reservations, it's a sought-after spot. When I called to make reservations, they were booked for the whole night. But, the hostess said, we could come in, see how long the wait was, and hang at the bar...or we could eat there. Going somewhere else wasn't an option. I'd been looking at the menu online almost daily, doing the foodie version of midday fantasizing. I was going to ring in my 30th birthday at The Roosevelt.So that's what we did, clinking cocktails (a Manhattan for him, a Seersucker-Maker's Mark, house-made sweet tea syrup, Angosturra bitters, and a charred lemon cube-for me) and then clinking forks as we dug into each other's dishes. Which brings me to another thing I love about eating at the bar: in addition to getting the benefit of the bartender's insider know-how, you get the casual intimacy of hanging out with a person you like rather than the formality of sitting across from each other. You can lean into the conversation, rest your head briefly on your companion's shoulder, jab at them when they tease you, and get a bite of their dish without having to reach across the table. It might not be romance-at least, it's not the white table cloth and candles kind-but it is closeness, and it is quite nice.Now, you might be wondering if I'd have felt the same if my dining partner had been someone other than my husband. So I'll tell you about the meal I had just last week at Traif, in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood. I went with a Riot coworker who is also a close friend. We chose the bar over a potentially long wait. We ordered cocktails and got into the spirit of small plates by selecting several to try. Unbeknownst to us, the bartender picked up on what we liked and sent us a few extra dishes to taste. We progressed from talking about how good the food was to not talking much at all. We didn't have to. The silent, wide-eyed, vigorous nodding, the pointing of our forks at the quickly emptying plates, and the deep sighs said everything. We were waited on. We lingered. It was lovely.When I did finally manage to speak, what came out was, ""I am deeply happy in my soul."" ""That's a good place to be,"" replied the bartender, who I didn't know was listening. And he was right. Because at the end of a long day, there's no better place to be than sitting beside a person who knows you so well that you don't have to talk while you share a good meal and who doesn't object when you stick your fork onto their plate because they knew from the beginning that you were going to.You can keep your Dining Experiences. I'll be the cat by the bar toasting to the good life."

None of us wants to see something like that happen again -- and because of that, our country has been talking a lot about guns and gun safety.A study just released in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) has something to add to the conversation. It finds that the states with the most firearm legislation have fewer deaths from guns than the states with the least firearm legislation.Using information about firearm legislation in different states collected by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, researchers from Boston Children's Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health divided the states into quartiles based on the amount and breadth of their firearm legislation. They then compared this with data on firearm deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What they found was striking:• States with the most firearm legislation had 42 percent fewer deaths from firearms than states with the least legislation • It wasn't just homicide that was less (by 40 percent) -- suicides using firearms were also lower, by 37 percent. • People didn't find other ways to kill others or themselves -- in the states with lower deaths from firearm, there weren't more homicides or suicides from other causes. • States with the most firearm laws had the lowest levels of household gun ownershipThe last point is an important one, because it gets at the chicken-or-egg problem of this study. As the authors point out, they can't tell whether having more laws is the cause of the fewer deaths. It could actually be the other way around: It may be that in states with more guns, it's harder to get gun laws passed because of the way people feel about guns in that state. And as other studies have shown, when there are more people who own guns, there are more deaths from guns.So it may be that more gun laws don't actually lead to fewer gun deaths. But what if they do? Or -- what if some particular laws do? In the study, the types of legislation most clearly associated with decreasing rates of death were laws involving universal background checks and those that required permits to purchase firearms. In 2010, 31, 672 people died from firearms. Of them, 380 were less than 15 years old --including 11 infants, and 71 toddlers and preschoolers. 6, 201 were between the ages of 15 and 24.That's a lot of lives cut short.""Our hope is this study will help inform the ongoing public debate related to firearms,"" said Eric Fleegler, MD, the lead author. That public debate has been contentious at times, and the debate about this study will likely be contentious too. But this isn't your average chicken-or-egg problem. Lives are at stake.All of us, however we might feel about guns, want to keep our family, friends and neighbors safe. So let's take this study and really look at it and learn anything we can from it. Let's work together to find the solutions that make sense -- and save lives."

Of course, when I’m on red carpets, I’m nervous, sweaty and weird.”Of course, Selena put on her high-fashion brave face for the subscriber cover, sporting a minimalist dress and bustier by Calvin Klein Collection. And for what it's worth, Selena, we don't think you ever look nervous and sweaty... maybe just a little, er, sparkly. Just stick to looking like your fresh, gorgeous self and we don't foresee any more problems!PHOTOS:See more of Selena's style!Want more?
