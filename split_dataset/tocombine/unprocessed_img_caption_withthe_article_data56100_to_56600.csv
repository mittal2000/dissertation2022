A Shetland sheepdog named Ollie, who lives in Portland, Oregon, became almost completely paralyzed following a camping trip with his humans. With what seemed like no chance of recovery, his family reluctantly decide to have him humanely euthanized at DoveLewis Emergency Animal Hospital.When preparing for the procedure, the emergency hospital's extern Neena Golden happened to find a tick on Ollie. Shortly after, a veterinarian diagnosed the dog with tick paralysis. Just hours after the tick was removed, Ollie started roaming around on his own and even needed a bathroom break. “Ollie is looking better and better every day,” Al Meteney, the pup's owner, said in a press release. The dog had become more and more lethargic after the camping trip. Soon, he even had trouble eating and walking. Though the family brought the dog to their regular veterinarian who ran several tests on the animal, the cause of Ollie's condition wasn't found.In fact, it just got worse and Ollie eventually couldn't eat or go to the bathroom on his own. “When his mobility was shot and he was paralyzed, it was just weird seeing him just laying there on the floor, knowing he had so much more life in him,” Falline Fate, Meteney's daughter, told KPTV. While Golden and veterinarian Dr. Adam Stone were preparing for the euthanasia procedure, Golden scratched the pup's ears to comfort him and found a thick lump of fur. Stone was then able to diagnose Ollie with the rare condition -- something the doctor hadn't encountered before. “I had never seen a tick paralysis case. It’s one of those things you learn about randomly in school -- it’s on one slide during one presentation,” he said.Since his ordeal, Ollie has been doing much better and has returned to his active, happy self. For that, Fate told KPTV she's grateful. “It was just pure grace that the people found something and decided to check it out further.”"
1,POLITICS,Paul LePage Keeps Citing A Heroin Overdose That Police And School Officials Say Never Happened,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-lepage-naloxone_us_57449c61e4b0aad87c8bac3a,The Maine governor claims a student repeatedly overdosed on heroin in one week. The high school says it's not true.,2016-05-24,"Maine Gov. Paul LePage has been repeating a story about a high school student who uses heroin, but the school says it isn't true.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57449c991a00002f00c297d9.jpeg?cache=B1Zf2o8q7R&ops=crop_0_125_3000_1813%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) has been on the defensive since he vetoed a bill last month that would have increased access to a lifesaving overdose medication. ""Naloxone does not truly save lives; it merely extends them until the next overdose,"" he argued. The legislature, however, overwhelmingly overrode his veto. In town hall events this month, LePage has continued to insist that naloxone, also known as Narcan, isn't a solution, repeatedly pointing to the case of a student at Deering High School as an example of why it's problematic. ""A junior at Deering High School had three Narcan shots in one week. And after the third one, he got up and went to class. He didn’t go to the hospital. He didn’t get checked out. He was so used to it. He just came out of it and went to class,"" LePage said in Lewiston on May 4. LePage again talked about Deering High School overdoses during a recent town hall in Damariscotta, according to the Bangor Daily News. And on a radio show Monday, he said he knew of at least two other students in eighth and 11th grades who overdosed. ""I know of one situation where a high school kid was airlifted to Maine Medical and he survived,"" the governor said. ""So they're in our schools. We can say all we want, that they're not in our schools and you can ask for all the apologies in the world, but let's keep our kids alive.""LePage's office did not return a request for more details on these students. But Deering High School has said flat-out that the governor's story is made-up. ""It's not true. It's absolutely not true,"" school principal Ira Waltz told the Maine Public Broadcasting Network in early May. ""We don't even possess the medication in the building. And I checked with the school nurse and the school-based health center, and we have no access to that medication. And so, if there was an overdose at Deering, we would have called 911. That would have been our intervention.""But on Monday, LePage continued to insist the Deering High School tale was real. ""It was not fabricated. This was an actual conversation,"" he said, noting that Portland Police Chief Michael Sauschuck was ""in the room"" when he heard the story. On Tuesday, Sauschuck also said LePage's story was false. He said the governor was referring to a conversation with Steve Black, the school resource officer at Deering, that took place last fall. Black did not talk about overdoses at the high school. “It did not involve Deering High School, it did not involve a school bathroom,” Sauschuck said, according to the Maine Public Broadcasting Network. ""It did involve Deering Oaks Park. But that was one example. And, to be quite frank, there are scenarios where people are being [revived] multiple times. But how all that came together, I have no idea."" Deering Oaks is a public park, not a school. Sauschuck reiterated that Black ""was not referencing any kind of overdose at Deering High School.""Nancy Dube, the school nursing consultant for the Maine Department of Education, said she has not heard of a serious drug overdose happening in a school in the state. The governor's veto of the naloxone bill essentially argued that addict lives are not worth saving because they will simply overdose again -- an assumption that is not true. The measure allows people to go to a pharmacy to access the medication. ""Creating a situation where an addict has a heroin needle in one hand and a shot of naloxone in the other produces a sense of normalcy and security around heroin use that serves only to perpetuate the cycle of addiction,"" he wrote in his veto message at the time. State Sen. Cathy Breen (D), a supporter of the legislation, called LePage's statement ""insensitive."" ""Gov. LePage is insinuating that Mainers suffering from addiction are beyond reach -- that they cannot be saved,"" she said in a statement. ""I disagree. Narcan can be the difference between an early grave and an intervention that can put an addict on the path to recovery. We know that Narcan saves lives. It is incumbent on us to make sure it is readily available."" ""I'm a pro-life person,"" added state Rep. Jeff Timberlake (R), who initially opposed the bill but eventually voted to override LePage's veto. ""How could I possibly take the chance for somebody to live away from them?"""

Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, said of a ""bubble burst"" that ""I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy"" property and ""make a lot of money.""Clinton's campaign and her surrogates have seized on the recording to argue that she would take better care of the U.S. economy. She is seeking to blunt the inroads that Trump has been making with voters in crucial states such as Florida and Ohio.Trump, in a statement released Tuesday afternoon, defended the comments as the mark of shrewd dealmaking, arguing that he would bring that sort of sharp business acumen with him to the White House.""Frankly, this is the kind of thinking our country needs, understanding how to get a good result out of a very bad and sad situation. Politicians have no idea how to do this – they don’t have a clue,"" he said.Trump has never held elected office and often touts his history as a businessman in response to accusations that he is unprepared to assume the presidency.Opinion polls in key states show Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, and Trump are in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Nationally, Trump has been rising in polls to pull roughly even with Clinton.Clinton surrogates from Ohio and Florida held a conference call with reporters about Trump's statements. Her campaign also hosted related events in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada, which will all be battlegrounds in November's general election.""How could Trump possibly champion the collapse of the housing market and our economy?"" U.S. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio said on the call.Clinton, meanwhile, is still fighting on two fronts as she seeks to wrap up her primary battle with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.Clinton and Sanders both campaigned on Tuesday in California, which is among six states holding Democratic nominating contests on June 7. California has more Democratic delegates than any other state, and Sanders has invested heavily there.Clinton needs to win California for a strong finish heading into her party's national convention in July and to dispel questions about whether she can unite the party after a drawn-out, increasingly bitter primary race.Clinton on Monday turned down an invitation by Fox News to debate Sanders in California despite having agreed previously to a May debate. Her campaign said Clinton's time would be better spent meeting directly with California voters.Sanders took Clinton to task, saying her refusal was an insult to California voters. In a television ad released by his campaign on Tuesday that will run ahead of California's primary, Sanders says the state is a ""long way to Washington"" but voters can ""send them a message they can't ignore.""Sanders on Tuesday also requested that the state of Kentucky review his loss there last week toClinton by fewer than 2,000 votes. Kentucky's secretary of state, Alison Grimes, said in a statement that they will recanvass the results at all 120 county boards of election.(Additional reporting by Alana Wise and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

Sanders had previously said, “We’ll see,” when asked whether he would fundraise on behalf of other candidates. But Sanders has begun to rebut that criticism, fundraising for three House candidates in April, and for another this past week. On Tuesday, Sanders went further, endorsing eight state legislative candidates “who embody the spirit of our political revolution.” “No president, not Bernie Sanders, not the greatest president you could possibly imagine, can take on the billionaire class alone,” Sanders wrote in a fundraising email to his supporters. “And that’s because change never happens from the top down, it always occurs from the bottom up.”The candidates Sanders named in his email are South Carolina state Reps. Justin Bamberg and Terry Alexander; Wisconsin state Rep. David Bowen; South Dakota House candidate Clara Hart; Illinois state Rep. Carol Ammons; California state Senate candidate Jane Kim; Colorado state Rep. Joe Salazar; and Vermont state Senate candidate Chris Pearson.Sanders noted that the next round of congressional redistricting in 2020 is approaching. Democrats would need to win back GOP-dominated state legislative chambers to have more of an influence on how districts are drawn, which is key to them taking back the U.S. House. “Bernie believes that the path toward bold change requires leaders to take back control of state capitols around the country and ensure fair redistricting in 2020,” Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, said in a statement. “The leaders we’re raising money for today are the members of Congress, senators and presidential candidates of tomorrow.”The House candidates Sanders had previously fundraised for, like Lucy Flores in Nevada, have seen a flood of donations to their campaigns after receiving Sanders' endorsement. Law professor Tim Canova, who is challenging Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida, received more than $250,000 from small-dollar donors after Sanders endorsed him in a fundraising email. Clinton currently leads Sanders by roughly 270 pledged delegates as the end of the primary season approaches. "

6,POLITICS,This Texas City Has Gone Without Safe Tap Water For Almost 2 Weeks,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/corpus-christi-water-boil-order_us_574490b7e4b0613b512b69bc,"A citywide water boil advisory in Corpus Christi is affecting people, schools and businesses alike.",2016-05-24,"A man walks through the water on Kostoryz Road on Monday, May 16, 2016, in Corpus Christi, Texas. Storms have contributed to ongoing issues with the city's water supply.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5744bc7b130000d605382a6b.jpeg?cache=F3WXWNDYRh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The nickname of Corpus Christi, Texas -- the eighth largest city in the state by population, and one of the 60 largest cities in the U.S. -- is the Sparkling City by the Sea.It's not a terribly apt nickname right now.That’s because the coastal city of about 300,000 is nearly two weeks into a widespread water boil advisory, its third in the past 10 months.The city issued the latest advisory on May 13 after low levels of chlorine disinfectant were detected in the city’s water system, making the water risky for residents to ingest. Similar advisories were issued in July and September 2015.Though no E. coli or other bacteria has been detected in the city’s water supply, the advisory won’t be lifted until Wednesday at the earliest, as the chlorine the city is using to treat the problem is taking longer than anticipated to spread, according to local news reports.As the treatment was completed by 2 p.m. local time on Tuesday, it will be at least another 18 hours before water samples may confirm disinfectant levels and authorities can call off the advisory, a city spokeswoman said.Much has happened since the boil advisory began. Corpus Christi city manager Ron Olson resigned from office on May 17 amid the scandal, and some residents are now urging Mayor Nelda Martinez to follow in his footsteps. A Facebook page calling for Martinez to be recalled has received more than 1,500 likes as of Tuesday evening.Residents, of course, are not happy. Emily Suggs, a 38-year-old writer and stay-at-home mom who lives on the city’s south side, says her family has been relying heavily on bottled water since the boil order began.It's a major inconvenience, she said. But she's more concerned with how the city’s lower-income residents, who may not be able to afford bottled water, are dealing with the order.“If you have never been under a boil advisory before, it's like having a part-time job, watching water boil,” Suggs told The Huffington Post in an email.The situation has also caught the attention of well-known environmental activist Erin Brockovich, whose colleague, the water quality expert Robert Bowcock, traveled to Corpus Christi on Monday to participate in a special city council meeting on the matter.Bowcock reportedly said this week that Corpus Christi is ""light years ahead"" of other cities in terms of water treatment, and that he was confident the city has the tools it needs to prevent similar issues in the future.Of course, issues of this sort aren't limited to Corpus Christi.As HuffPost noted this week in a national analysis of water boil notices, many U.S. cities are struggling to address deteriorating conditions in their water systems -- conditions that often result in water main breaks and boil advisories. The analysis found 142 advisories in 27 different states over the course of one month.Erik Olson, the Natural Resources Defense Council’s health and environment program director, described Corpus Christi’s issues as “indicative of a much broader problem.”“We think a lot of peoples’ health is being threatened by deteriorated, crumbling water infrastructure,” Olson told HuffPost. “It’s largely out of sight, out of mind, until people are told to boil their water and it seems to come out of nowhere. But it’s entirely predictable and is occurring in cities across the country.”Some residents, like Suggs, remain skeptical that the city’s treatment plan will get at the heart of the problem, which has also affected Corpus Christi restaurants and area schools. According to KRIS, the local NBC affiliate, the local school district is spending about $15,000 per school day on bottled water for its students.“There doesn't seem to be an answer as to why this has happened again,” Suggs said.Jordan Davison, a 19-year-old college student and movie theater manager, has lived in Corpus Christi his whole life. He’s somewhat optimistic the city will take the necessary steps to address the maintenance needs of its decaying water system. At the same time, though, he's not totally sure it will happen.“I don't believe the city is prioritizing what's best for its people,” Davison told HuffPost.The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which called for the advisory, provided the following statement to HuffPost on Tuesday:The City of Corpus Christi and the TCEQ are cooperatively addressing this issue and progress is being made. The city initiated a temporary chlorine conversion (from chloramine to free chlorine) at noon on Thursday, May 19, 2016. The purpose of the conversion is to improve the quality of water. The TCEQ will continue to work with the city and provide technical assistance, as needed. As of today, May 24, 2016, the city continues the conversion to free chlorine throughout the distribution system. Once the conversion is complete, additional monitoring will be conducted and results evaluated to determine compliance with free chlorine residual and bacteriological parameters.Mark Van Vleck, Corpus Christi's assistant city manager, and Dan Grimsbo, the city's interim director of utilities treatment, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.UPDATE: The TCEQ announced in a news release Wednesday afternoon that testing of Corpus Christi's water had met the criteria for the boil water advisory to be lifted. The city announced the end of the advisory, effective immediately, at a 5 p.m. news conference."

The U.S. company's shares jumped 9.5 percent to $111.17 in pre-market trading.""UPPER LIMIT""Global agrochemicals companies are racing to consolidate, partly in response to a drop in commodity prices that has hit farm incomes and also due to the growing convergence between seeds and pesticides markets.ChemChina is buying Switzerland's Syngenta for $43 billion after Syngenta rejected a bid from Monsanto, while Dow and DuPont are forging a $130 billion business.With German rival BASF also looking into a possible tie-up with Monsanto, Bayer has moved to avoid being left behind.Baumann rejected suggestions from some investors that Bayer should instead try to forge a joint venture with Monsanto, saying this would have tax disadvantages.Sources close to the matter have said BASF is unlikely to start a bidding war with Bayer. BASF declined to comment on Monday. But analysts say Bayer might still have to pay more to persuade Monsanto and its shareholders to sell up.That could be a problem, with some saying Bayer's proposal, at 15.8 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the year ended Feb. 29, is already a stretch for the German company.""The price that has now been disclosed is at the upper limit and it is just about economical. Should it rise further, which is to be assumed, the takeover will become increasingly unattractive,"" said Markus Manns, a fund manager at Union Investment, Bayer's 14th biggest investor.Shares in Bayer, which had already fallen 14 percent since rumors of a bid emerged last week, dropped as much as 3.6 percent on Monday to a new 2-1/2 year low of 86.3 euros.""VERY AMBITIOUS""Bayer said it would finance the bid with a combination of debt and equity, primarily a share sale to existing investors. Equity would account for about a quarter of the deal value.Equinet analyst Marietta Miemietz, who has a 'buy' rating on Bayer stock, said the extra debt appeared manageable but could limit Bayer's ability to invest in its healthcare business, which some analysts think needs a boost to its drugs pipeline.Baumann said Bayer would continue to develop its healthcare arm, which includes stroke prevention pill Xarelto and aspirin, the painkiller it invented more than a century ago.""We are not feeding Peter by starving Paul here,"" he said, adding no asset sales were planned to help pay for the deal.Bayer also forecast synergies from a deal with Monsanto would boost annual earnings by around $1.5 billion after three years, plus additional future benefits from integrated product offerings - a reference to its push to combine the development and sale of seeds and crop protection chemicals.Berenberg analysts, who have a 'buy' rating on Bayer shares, described the synergies estimate as ""very ambitious"".(Reporting by Maria Sheahan, Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss; Writing by Ludwig Burger and Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Mark Potter)"

10,POLITICS,Supreme Court Bars GOP Congressmen From Defending Racially Gerrymandered Map,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-congressional-redistricting-virginia_us_5743422ce4b045cc9a71a1c7,"Claims that their Virginia districts might be ""flooded"" with Democrats weren't convincing.",2016-05-23,"Reps. Randy Forbes, Rob Wittman and Dave Brat are going to have to run for re-election without the justices' help.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574346de1300000105382839.jpeg?cache=FTvd0gN9xP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a short opinion that hints at compromise, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to allow Republican lawmakers to defend a Virginia districting map that had earlier been ruled racially discriminatory.At issue was the state's 3rd Congressional District, which a lower court had determined was drawn unconstitutionally because it packed too many black voters into one district and thereby diluted black voting power overall. The 3rd District seat is held by Rep. Bobby Scott (D), currently the state's only African-American in Congress.Virginia, which is now led by a Democratic governor, never appealed the lower court ruling. But three Republican congressmen did, arguing that the now-overturned redistricting plan should be reinstated because the redrawn map would harm their re-election prospects.The new map was approved earlier this year by the same lower court that had found the original plan constituted an illegal racial gerrymander.In a unanimous ruling written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the Supreme Court said the three lawmakers -- Reps. Randy Forbes, Rob Wittman and Dave Brat -- had failed to establish ""standing"" to intervene in the dispute because they couldn't show they had suffered any injury.Forbes, who currently represents District 4, has chosen to switch over to District 2, which offers him a better chance of re-election. When the state redrew District 3, it shifted more black voters into District 4. Forbes had earlier claimed that change would turn District 4 into a ""safe 60% Democratic district” if the Supreme Court didn't intervene.But since Forbes isn't running in District 4 now, Breyer wrote that he couldn't ""see how any injury that Forbes might have suffered ‘is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.'""As for Wittman and Bratt, who represent Virginia's 1st and 7th congressional districts, the justices simply found no evidence that their legislative turf would be ""flooded with Democratic voters"" in a way that would lead to losses in November -- especially since the case centered on districts far removed from theirs.The practical result of Monday's ruling is that the new congressional map will remain in effect heading into the 2016 election.The minimalist ruling is also the third this term in an area, voting rights, where the Supreme Court has often clashed along ideological lines. The previous two were handed down in April, and all three have lacked major fireworks -- perhaps to avoid even splits or the appearance of partisanship in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia's death."

With so many plot twists and storylines, it can be hard to keep up. Even the cast thinks so. During a discussion at Vulture Fest in New York City on Saturday, the cast of the Golden Globe-winning show revealed that they, too, don't know what's going on most of the time. ""Its so crazy -- you're like, 'Oh, yeah, I know what's going to happen,' and then you get your script and you're like, 'What?! I never heard that,'"" said Carly Chaikin, who plays Darlene on the hit show. ""But [director Sam Esmail] has such an amazing vision of who we are, that when he would talk to me about it, it would just make me so excited.""Portia Doubleday, who plays the main character Elliot's childhood friend Angela, even admitted, ""Sometimes I have to Wikipedia our own show to figure out [what's going on].""""This season, there are a couple things where I'm like, 'Wait, when did that happen?' I actually had to research it and figure it out as opposed to [knowing] what episode was that in,"" she said.Chaikin added that she and her cast mates had arguments about scripts with Esmail, but they always eventually realized the director knew what he was doing. ""It's nice to be in the hands of somebody we absolutely trust,"" Christian Slater, who plays the eponymous Mr. Robot, said. ""He does get it and there is a reason for each and every thing we end up doing and saying. He's thought it all the way through.""In fact, they trust Esmail so much, Chaikin joked, ""If [he] started a cult, we probably would just follow. We'd be like, 'Well, if you think it's good, then, you're right.'"" ""Mr. Robot"" Season 2 premieres July 13 at 10 p.m. ET on USA. "

John Bel Edwards (D) is expected to sign a bill that will expand state hate crime statutes to include any attack on a police officer, EMT or firefighter. HB 953 has passed in both chambers of the state legislature, and if it's signed, Louisiana would be first state in the country with such a law. State Rep. Lance Harris (R) said he was inspired to pen the bill following the murder of Sheriff's Deputy Darren Goforth in Houston last August. “It looked like it was strictly done because someone didn’t like police officers, like a hate crime,” Harris told CNN on Friday.HB 953 is commonly known as “Blue Lives Matter,"" a phrase co-opted from the Black Lives Matter movement and that stands as a counterpoint to criticisms of police brutality. The Blue Lives Matter movement maintains that in fact, police officers are under attack and need extra protections. “I certainly do think there is a need for it,"" Harris said. ""If you’re going to have an extensive hate crime statute then we need to protect those that are out there protecting us on a daily basis.""""There is a concerted effort in some areas to terrorize and attack police and I think this will go forward and stop that,” Harris added, citing social media attacks on police officers. But rates of assault and deadly violence against police in the U.S. have actually declined. Only 41 police officers were intentionally killed while on duty in 2015 -- nearly a 20 percent decrease from 2014 -- making it one of the safest years for police officers on record, according to preliminary statistics from the FBI.Critics of the bill say hate crime legislation should stick to race, religion, ethnicity and other static attributes. “It’s really focused on immutable characteristics,” Allison Goodman, regional director for the Anti-Defamation League, told The Advocate of the current state statute. “Proving the bias intent for a hate crime for law enforcement or first responders is very different than proving it for someone who is Jewish or gay or black.” Others have asserted that it is actually citizens and not police who are under siege. Officers are heavily protected by the justice system: They typically do not face legal repercussions for using lethal force against civilians, and when someone kills an officer, they are usually swiftly prosecuted to the full extent of the law. In some states, such as Michigan and New York, killing a police officer is an automatic first-degree murder charge. The New Orleans chapter of Black Youth Project 100, a black activist organization, is asking that Edwards veto the bill. “By treating the police as specialized citizens held above criticism and the laws they are charged to enforce, we lose our ability to exercise our First Amendment right,” the organization wrote in a statement. “Including ‘police’ as a protected class in hate crime legislation would serve to provide more protection to an institution that is statistically proven to be racist in action, policy, and impact.”Edwards is expected to sign the bill this week, his press secretary Shauna Sanford told The Huffington Post.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post incorrectly referred to the ""Blue Lives Matter"" legislation as HB 923. It is HB 953."

Daniel Donovan (R-N.Y.) said Monday that the the failure of GOP leaders to even give Merrick Garland a hearing, never mind a vote, is the kind of thing that makes Americans cynical about politics.""I've never thought that was a good idea,"" Donovan told reporters at an an event in Staten Island, New York. ""I've always thought that the Republicans were wrong, that they should see who the nominee was -- actually, the president nominated Judge Garland -- and judge him on his abilities, his jurisprudence.""Donovan, a first-term member of Congress, said senators who don't think Garland is a good choice should just vote against him instead of denying him a hearing. Garland is currently the chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.""In the hearings, he’d be asked pointed questions, which I don’t think we have the advantage of now because we don’t have a hearing,"" said Donovan. ""We'd be able to judge the man better if he was able to respond to some of the questions people have.""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has more or less kept his caucus united in opposing confirmation hearings for Garland. They've made the unprecedented argument that Obama's time in the White House is nearly over, so the next president should get to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. The court has had an empty seat since Antonin Scalia died in February. That's had its own ramifications.But a few Republicans have pushed for Garland to get a vote, including Sen. Mark Kirk (Ill.), Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) and Senate hopeful David Jolly, who is currently a Florida congressman. Conservative Sen. Jerry Moran (Kansas) surprised a lot of people when he said he, too, thought Garland deserved a vote. But then someone pulled him into a room and threatened some stuff (or at least it seemed like it), and he changed his mind. The White House and congressional Democrats have spent months trying to shame Republicans into letting Garland's nomination move, using the hashtag #doyourjob on social media. McConnell hasn't budged, but public opinion has. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll from April found that a majority of Americans think Garland should get a confirmation vote this year."
