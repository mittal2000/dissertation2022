Former State Coordinator for U.S. Senator Russ Feingold",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-day-my-boss-came-out_us_5bafb375e4b0ad76926057d9,Sen. Russ Feingold's statement in Paddock Lake occurred the same year as a vote by the citizens of Wisconsin to change the state constitution to define marriage strictly as between a man and a woman. That November the change would easily be passed in Wisconsin to no one's surprise.,2013-03-30,"Gay pride flags flying at the US Supreme Court on March 27, 2013 in Washington, DC. The Supreme Court, for the first time, takes up the delicate and divisive issue of gay marriage when the nine justices consider the legality of a California ballot initiative that limits marriage to opposite-sex couples. Wednesday, the court will consider the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which limits the definition of marriage to opposite-sex couples.

It was the spring of 2006 and U.S. Senator Russ Feingold announced in Paddock Lake, WI his clear and unequivocal support for marriage equality. Paddock Lake is a small village in a rural part of Kenosha County in southeastern Wisconsin and not necessarily a hot bed for the pro-gay marriage movement. Senator Feingold, as part of his pledge to the citizens of Wisconsin, held a town hall meeting each year in all of Wisconsin's 72 counties. It was during his town hall meeting in Paddock Lake that he made his view on this issue known. It was also during this time that I had the privilege of serving as the State Coordinator for Senator Feingold's Wisconsin offices. I served in this role for him and the residents of Wisconsin for seven years.   His statement in Paddock Lake occurred the same year as a vote by the citizens of Wisconsin to change the state constitution to define marriage strictly as between a man and a woman. That November the change would easily be passed in Wisconsin to no one's surprise.   That spring in Paddock Lake, as the issue of writing discrimination into our constitution slowly started to gain attention and polling showed strong support for amending the Constitution, someone stood up in Wisconsin and said this was not right. That person was U.S. Senator Russ Feingold, who, in response to a question from a Wisconsinite, not only clearly stated his opposition to amending the state constitution but stated his support for allowing homosexual couples to marry. Senator Feingold, while knowing this was not an issue the U.S. Senate would consider any time soon, felt it was important for him to share his belief with the citizens of Wisconsin before they voted on this issue at the ballot box. Senator Feingold's willingness to speak out on this issue -- even when it was clear through polling that it was not a popular position -- was an amazingly courageous stand.  The issue of marriage equality has evolved over time and support for this important issue has grown strong, not only on the left but also for some on the right. In recent weeks and days we have seen a number of national political figures come out in support of this important issue. While I appreciate and greatly respect these individuals for these stands, they are merely demonstrating ""courage of circumstance."" While I will not call all of them political opportunists, it is convenient they have, in most cases, changed their beliefs because the polls have changed or they recognize the impact of discrimination on a family member or friend. That is why now it is important to not only thank and recognize those who have finally acknowledged the grave injustice that has been done but to thank those, like Senator Feingold, who had the backbone to take this stand when it was not popular. Over the years I was fortunate to witness a number of occasions where Senator Feingold took courageous stands like this and he took these stands because they were the right thing to do, regardless of the political consequences-good, bad or indifferent. I might also add, Senator Feingold did not do this in hiding or just for the benefit of the national media. He did it when meeting with the people of Wisconsin, something that happens far too infrequently today.   By the way if you were unaware Senator Feingold took this stand so long ago, maybe it is because Twitter would not exist until four months after he announced his support."

As Pink News and Carbonated.tv are both reporting, the capital city of the Netherlands will fly the rainbow flag when Putin arrives on April 8 in protest of Russia's proposed ""gay propaganda"" legislation. “The [Amsterdam] College wishes to express its concern with the rainbow flag and the seven districts will ask to do the same,” a spokesperson for the city’s council is quoted by Carbonated as saying. ”Amsterdam is committed to an open and tolerant city where everyone can be who he is. The flag stands for diversity and gay acceptance.”Putin's visit, which marks a year of cultural exchange between Russia and the Netherlands, will include visits to the Maritime Museum and the Hermitage Museum, according to Pink News. The Dutch reports coincide with news that Putin is now calling for a ban on foreign gay couples adopting Russian children, according to Gay Star News. Russian legislation which took effect in January already bans U.S. citizens from adopting children from Russia. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights have been a hot issue in Russia as of late. Shocking footage of a local LGBT rights activist being beaten by an alleged neo-Nazi made the blogosphere rounds earlier this week.The activist, identified by Gay Star News as Artem Kalinin, was speaking out against the ban of a planned Pride parade, which had been scheduled for March 31 in Syktyvkar, at the time of the attack.So-called ""homosexual propaganda"" legislation, which has already been enacted in St. Petersburg as well as a number of other Russian municipalities, is currently being pushed by the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church to be enforced nationwide. Such laws would would make it illegal nationwide to provide minors with information that is defined as ""propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality and transgenderism,"" according to the Associated Press, and bring a fine of up to $16,000.

The album was an attempt at a fresh sound, but critics felt the project's ""cool factor"" seemed a little forced. Her duet ""Let Us Move On"" with hip-hop fave Kendrick Lamar was taken as a glaring example of this fact. The Strokes' ""Comedown Machine"" presented a band that seems to have lost its chemistry and Lil' Wayne's ""I Am Not Human II"" received negative marks for being a little stagnant. The rapper didn't bring as much energy as with his last album. Rounding out this week's new music was One Republic's ""Native, which lost points for its lead singer's bland delivery. In movies, ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" was an overwhelming mix of explosions and shootouts that lacked a solid storyline, leaving most critics extremely confused. ""Welcome to the Punch"" wasted a strong cast on an unrealistic film that failed to allow viewers to connect with it's characters. It was praised for being well shot, but that is about it. Tyler Perry's ""Temptation"" was, well, just terrible and""The Host"" was a boring take on a story we've heard before -- aliens take over earth and humans must find someway to survive.

The two actors, perhaps the best of their generation, deliver deft performances as their fictive lives twine, one a carny, the other a cop, in this triptych about fathers and sons on the American landscape, making this the most thrilling two and a half hours of storytelling in the cinemas right now.If you are looking to mix your epic drama with realism, Schenectady is perfect: an upstate New York locale of tract houses, scruffy trailer compounds, blue-collar diners, and secretive woodsy places, where men can meet, (or not meet) for justice served on its own terms. A mysterious stranger with a special ""skill set"" on motorcycles, Luke (Gosling) wants to father the son he has with Romina (Mendes), and goes rogue. Avery Cross (Cooper) stops him dead. Trained in law, and with political ambition, he betrays corrupt officers led by Liotta, advised by his father who is a judge (an excellent Harris Yulin). In the third act, these events are visited upon their sons: AJ (full lipped, baby faced Emory Cohen who sounds a bit like Brando by way of Queens), and Jason (DeHaan) become friends sharing moody teen alienation and a taste for ""oxy."" In the end, you learn just what it takes to leave Schenectady.Katie Holmes, Patricia Clarkson, Oliver Platt with his son George made their way to the Bowery Hotel. Cianfrance's wife Shannon Plumb, fresh from her premiere of New Director's Towheads, joined in. Bradley Cooper took a break from shooting his next film in Boston with his Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell. Ryan Gosling's collaboration with Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn, Only God Forgives, is due in the fall. Eva Mendes will star in a comedy with Larry David.Dane DeHaan was with John Krokidas, director of Sundance hit Kill Your Darlings; DeHaan plays a character based on beat icon Lucien Carr. When asked whether his skin had been purposely pimpled, a sure sign of adolescent angst for The Place Beyond the Pines, the pale actor said, ""Just the opposite.

5,QUEER VOICES,Spotlight on Isis King: Her Journey Into Self-Identity,"Martin Berusch, Contributor

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images for OUT Magazine)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafb2fc2200003401db1796.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Current events on a global level are increasingly affecting our collective experience in how we view and position ourselves and others in the world. Whether we realize it or not, the exposure to new knowledge on a constant and increasingly frequent basis, along with increasing interaction between us all, is making us more receptive to accepting our incredible complexity and diversity. We are beings who have a lot more in common than one might think.When directing our attention to the transgender experience and focusing on the value that this segment of our community brings to bear, we will come to realize that, as a species, we are not so different from one another. In fact, it makes me believe that once we come closer to understanding one another, we will begin to truly respect each other's coexistence. If we turn our attention towards any number of countries and witness how the transgender community is increasingly becoming part of the mainstream, we will see how these changes are manifesting in very tangible ways. Looking outward, toward Argentina, where legislation is in place that allows people to identify with a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth (even without having gone through gender reassignment), or to Poland, where there are openly gay and trans parliament members decrying anti-LGBT sentiments in their country, or even to Cuba, where we see how nascent social acceptance has allowed a transgender woman to hold a community-level political position, the message is the same. The topic of transgender equality is an increasingly integral part of the general global conversation. In the interest of broadening the platform for this conversation in our own country, I seek to find that common denominator that makes us all more relatable to one another, to further open up the channels of communication in order to learn about, understand and accept each other, as much for our differences as for our similarities. I intend to look inward and experience my own humanness. As I do so, I have reached out and talked to someone whom I admire and who can share with us firsthand the experience of being transgender. Her name is Isis King, and she was the first-ever transgender contestant on America's Next Top Model.Martin Berusch: Isis, there are a lot of terms, definitions, preconceptions, prejudices and misunderstandings to cover when it comes what it means to be transgender in the United States. When thinking about transgender issues, many still seem confused between being transsexual -- if that's even still proper terminology -- and being transgender. What's the difference?Isis King: To me, being a transsexual doesn't equate to being transgender. A transsexual is someone who changes their body to be more of the opposite sex than the gender they were assigned at birth (born biologically). Transgender is more about how you feel inside, where you don't necessarily have to change your body's genitalia. I personally have never really identified with the word ""transsexual,"" just because of its negative connotation. Therefore, I still identify as transgender. Berusch: When did you first realize that you are transgender?King: I've known pretty much my whole life. As a 4-year-old child I realized that I was different.Berusch: When did you start showing outward manifestations of your true gender identity? King: During that same time. As a young child I liked playing with dolls, playing with girl things, or playing with girls in general. So I would say that at that point I was already starting to show who I really felt that I was. However, I learned early on to keep it hidden, because I would be ""corrected"" by family when they found me doing so.Berusch: You said that you had to keep it hidden when you were young. When you eventually told them, how did your family respond to your gender identity? Were they supportive?King: I think I didn't tell my mom until I was around 20 years old. So, you know, at first she was very hesitant about accepting it, but at that point I was already living in New York. I was focusing on my fashion career, or trying to, anyway, all while I was transitioning. I wanted to make sure that when I told my family, I was already able to support myself. The fact is that I was concerned with being rejected and losing my family's support. Therefore I waited until I could live on my own and do my own thing in a whole different state before I even mentioned how I really felt.Berusch: Does your background have any bearing on the decisions you have made: when you decided to talk about it, or when you decided to really show your outward manifestation of your gender?King: Definitely. I think it has everything to do with it. In the black community, especially where I grew up... I would say my school was probably 95-percent black. Growing up, I witnessed how some people were outcasts in my community. All I had to go by were the examples I saw growing up within that community. There was very little tolerance. Whatever didn't fit into the mold would be ""corrected,"" whether that meant getting beaten up, you know... There really was no good example. Berusch: Looking at gender identity vs. sexual orientation, when you were biologically a boy, a male, did you identify as or relate to being a gay male?King: When I was younger I lived my life as a gay male, but that's not who I was, although even though I knew who I was, I just didn't know how to fully express it -- that is until I was actually surrounded by others who were like me. I actually never came across any other transgender people until I moved to New York when I was 21. Berusch: Could you share some of your experiences growing up female in a male body? King: I do remember being a kid and seeing a documentary about someone that had a sex change and thinking to myself, ""Oh, wow, that's possible. That's me. I want that for myself."" As I got older, it was really frustrating because, after a while, some people started telling me that I needed to get a girlfriend. I felt like telling them, ""But I'm not a lesbian!"" Of course, I couldn't say that at the time, because everyone would have thought that I was crazy. It wasn't until I went to college that I got to explore and research transgender topics and could truly come to terms with myself. Berusch: And while you were growing up, was there anybody whom you could confide in and share your feelings?King: No, I didn't even want to set myself up for that. This is why I waited until after college, when I had the money to go move away and support myself, that I finally came forward and followed through on my transition. I ultimately felt that I was safest sharing this information with my family from a distance. My position was and is, ""I love you, but this is how it is, and I have to do what's going to make me happy, and I don't want your (potential) pain to affect my decision."" Eventually I did develop the courage I needed to tell my family, because I just knew I had no other alternative. I came to realize that I couldn't live my life for other people. Berusch: That being said, how do you see yourself fitting in today's world, given all the current social and political changes taking place? Let's say, hypothetically, that there was legislation in the United States that protected transgender people, and that self-identity became more accepted by the general population. Do you think you still would have gone through gender reassignment?King: Well, no matter how politics were to play out or how society would otherwise embrace transgender individuals, ultimately it would not have changed how I felt about my body. It simply wouldn't have affected the choice I made. Therefore, it would not have affected the outcome.  Berusch: Now, going back in time, I'd like to explore a bit of your personal journey toward womanhood. I was reading up on a documentary that NBC did in 2007 called Born in the Wrong Body, and you were featured in one of the segments. Could you talk a little bit about that experience?King: Yes. I was on the second segment of the series, which was called ""Born in the Wrong Body: On the Edge."" It was about girls that were in the ballroom scene, which I was a part of, for about a year. The documentary showed me going to visit my family: my mom, my aunt, my oldest brother. It had me designing and getting ready for a ball. It showed different aspects of me: me early on as a designer, way before I was modeling. [Laughs.] It just showed me during the time I started taking my first hormone shots. Berusch: You and I initially met a few years ago at an event for the Ali Forney Center, which is a shelter and intake center for homeless LGBT youth. Could you talk about your experiences at AFC? King: Sure. I moved to New York in late 2006, and I was renting out a room for six months. At the time I had a retail job, but I didn't work enough hours to cover the rent, so it got hard for me financially. When I ran out of money, I had to decide whether or not to move back home with my family, or if I was going to stick it out in New York City. I was living full-time as a woman but wasn't far enough into the transition to the point that somebody couldn't dissuade me from continuing with my transition. Because I wanted to avoid all that, I opted to move into the shelter, get their assistance and continue with my transition. Berusch: So the Ali Forney Center served as a support system for you? Did they also provide you with any kind of guidance as to how to move forward with the transition process you were undertaking? King: No, I wasn't their typical resident. I already had my mind made up and had a game plan with respect to moving forward with my transition. By the time I turned 21 years old, I had everything mapped out. Callen-Lorde Community Health Center guided me through most of my transition, while the Ali Forney Center served as a safe haven for me.Berusch: Got it. Now, moving forward to your first stint on America's Next Top Model in 2008. There's plenty of information about your experience, including behind-the-scenes moments. For example, ANTM showed you taking your hormone shots and the nausea that you experienced afterward. You gave us a little bit of insight into what it really means to go through this process.King: [Laughs.] More than just a little, Martin. It just so happens that these were just circumstances that I fell into; I didn't necessarily want to take hormones on national television, but in the end it [was worth it] because it educated [a lot of] people to some of the process.Berusch: You returned to ANTM in 2010, and Tyra Banks surprised you by introducing you to Marci Bowers, a fellow trans woman and a top gender reassignment surgeon, who offered to perform the gender reassignment. Is this correct?King: Yes, but I want to correct you and have you refer to it as genital reassignment surgery. Tyra introduced me to Dr. Bowers in 2008, and then I began the process of the genital surgery in 2009, while I was to appear again on Tyra's show.Berusch: It was an all-expenses-paid surgery?King: Yes. As I mentioned, during that time, I was working as a receptionist, saving my money. I'm proud that I was well on my way to saving enough to actually have my surgery on my own. But this opportunity did present itself through Tyra, and I accepted the helping hand.Berusch: What obstacles did you face, if any, when you decided to undergo the process of genital reassignment?King: I really didn't have any obstacles. Berusch: Could you speak of the process itself, from pre-screening to the psychological treatments that you might have undergone, to hormone therapy, to the actual operation?King: You know, it's funny. A lot of my experiences from that time are really a blur by now. I do recall the evaluations and obviously having the hormone therapy. I think at that point I just wanted to get it out of the way. I remember speaking in depth to counselors at Callen-Lourde, to my mom, to Tyra and others, the day before the operation. Then I remember going through the surgery, having my mom taking care of me and just going home after that. Berusch: How do you feel about your decision post-op? Any complications?King: Haven't had any complications. I am completely happy with this one most important decision I made in my life and have no regrets.Berusch: As you've gone through your transition, what changes have you witnessed in how you view life?King: It's not so much what has changed but what has remained constant. I knew for a long time what I wanted, and that was to present myself to the world in my true image. Everyone who I've interacted with, pre- and post-surgery, realized that I had been born in the wrong body. This has only reinforced that I am now in my own rightful body.Berusch: We now know that you now identify yourself as a heterosexual woman. Am I correct in saying that?King: Yes, correct. Well, I should also say that even though I am transgender, I've always identified as a heterosexual female, even before my surgery. That's just how I've always seen myself. Berusch: Are there any differences that you perceive in your day-to-day life?King: I can't say that I view anything in life any differently, because my mind hasn't changed. Mentally, my view of the world hasn't been altered.Berusch: How do you see others accepting you? Obviously you've become a role model and a celebrity in the LGBT community, and even beyond, into the mainstream audience. What kind of comments have people made to you about your journey?King: I've always received positive feedback from people. Many have approached me and told me how my actions have inspired them and have even prevented them from despair and from considering suicide. That, in fact, was the beginning for me to realize the power I had to make change. I became a motivational speaker and have become more outspoken about offering support to anyone willing to hear me out. Berusch: Any negative feedback?King: Any negative feedback has been minimal. I just don't give anyone the opportunity to make discriminatory remarks. That said, I always make the effort to always portray myself in a positive light and as a positive person. Berusch: No matter who we are, whether we are in the LGBT community, the mainstream or the rest of the world -- and when I say the rest of the world, I mean the Western world -- we are increasingly pressured into a youth- and beauty-oriented society. What are your thoughts on aging, and how do you think you will grapple with getting older and possibly losing your physical attributes?King: Good question! You know, my mom is my greatest role model. I always look to her and see how she herself is aging gracefully. The way I see it is that if I have half of her genes, then I should be OK. [Smiles.] Also, I think that I won't have a problem with getting older, because I am such a young spirit. Berusch: So, basically excluding the maintenance that you've committed to in order to optimize your feminine attributes, let's say, using hormone therapy, you won't be running to the doctor's office to get a facelift when that time comes. Am I correct in saying that?King: Yes. And I'd like to add that my hormone dosages are lower than before I had my genital reassignment. But to answer your plastic surgery question, to reverse aging? No, I don't think I see that happening. I actually like the person I now see in the mirror, flaws and all. [Giggles.] Berusch: But barring that, you are telling me you wouldn't be that 50-year-old rushing to get a touch-up?King: Well, hmm, I don't know. Who can say? All I know is that I don't dislike the person I see in there; I like who I see in the mirror, imperfections and all. You know, I don't have body dysmorphic disorder. I'm happy with who I am. Of course, that's not to say that I don't wish that I was curvier [laughs], but this is my body type. I could drink all the protein shakes and eat every meal in the world, but I'm skinny. These are things that I just have to accept, and I'm fine with that. So what do I do with that? I use it to my advantage and model. Berusch: Now, even though you say you don't suffer from it, you did mention body dysmorphic disorder, or body dysmorphia, which is when someone is preoccupied and excessively concerned with their body image. This is very different from body dysphoria, a clinical term (likely on its way to becoming outdated) that is pinned on transgender individuals to classify them as being depressed or otherwise emotionally distressed because of the incongruence between their body and their gender identity, and therefore deserving of treatment. The usage of ""body dysphoria,"" and potentially further confusing it with ""body dysmorphia,"" may conflate and perpetuate fundamental misunderstandings that exacerbate the prejudices faced by the transgender community.King: Exactly. Thank you for pointing that out. It's important that people understand this, so they don't say, ""I knew it, I knew it,"" referring to the issue being that the transgender individual is potentially acting out of a place of misguidance. I do want to say that dysmorphia is very prevalent among females, and perhaps and more so with transgender individuals, because they are kind of a ""blank slate"" due to their transitive state. Like biological women, some trans individuals might be looking for an ideal of their version of perfection, which is unrealistic. But then again, in our society, this is happening more and more, not only with women but with men as well. Berusch: Now, speaking specifically to the changes we are witnessing in the LGBT community, in your opinion, what are the biggest hurdles that both transgender women and men still face despite the progress we have seen so far? King: I think that the negative and deprecating tone in how the transgender community is referred to by others is a tremendous hurdle to overcome. Coverage of trans problems and issues by the media is also horrible. Transgender is the new segregated subculture. We are still at the bottom of the totem pole. I would like to see more positive and well-informed coverage on us. It's important to depict us in a positive light instead of portraying us as victims, so that more transgender people surface as role models, ones that we will be able to look up to and see that they are an important part of society with much to contribute.Berusch: What changes would you like to see in how media covers the transgender community? King: Well, using proper terminology, being sensitive to the difficulties that transgender people live through, to see that we're human. I'd like media to research with more accuracy what they're actually talking about. They have a huge audience who are greatly influenced by what is shared in the news, and this audience has a huge impact on us transgender men and women. There is a direct correlation between how the news depicts the trans community and how the mainstream public reacts and treats us. We are treated like we are nothing, like we don't matter. Just by confusing transvestites with transgender, for example, or calling a transgender woman a man, or vice versa, the media is perpetuating prejudices. This dynamic continues to fuel ignorance, fear and potential violence against us. Bullying, rape, murder and suicide is a huge problem in the transgender community that must be reversed immediately. Berusch: What advice do you have for those who are considering genital reassignment?King: I'd say wait. Be strategic; timing is key. Give yourself the time and space to make informed decisions. Also, I want to point out that transitioning requires all your mental energy; it becomes everything in your life. When transitioning, you don't want any distractions from that. You want to be able to keep your focus, not letting other people's opinions influence you or have outside forces in general to get in the way. Berusch: When is the right time? When is it too young to transition? King: Looking back at my experience and my life, if I could have, I would have wanted to transition earlier had I the financial means and emotional support. But on the other hand, there's also the question of children who go through phases. So I don't know what is too young for transitioning. That's beyond my scope of understanding and experience. But personally, I'm glad that, as of now, they don't give hormones to kids; instead, they are able to give them hormone blockers. Again, I feel that it's important for people to make that decision for themselves. I get giving blockers to slow down puberty, but in my opinion, I think people should wait until the children are older to make the actual transition. Berusch: In other words, it is a very individual experience, and we still don't have all the answers. King: Exactly.Berusch: So where do you see the transgender community in the future -- say, a year from now, or five, or 20 years from now?King: That's hard to tell. I'm just yearning for everyone to become more accepting, to have more unity and more normalcy in everyday life. Berusch: You mentioned before that you are a rather positive person, and that you get little negative feedback. However, I did want to bring up some peripheral criticism you got for wearing a T-shirt that said, ""Gay Is OK.""King: [Laughs.] Mmm-hmm...Berusch: I'd like some input from you about what that criticism meant to you. What was your ""takeaway"" from that experience?King: Well, for me it was great to be a part of that huge campaign. I was a little shocked that the only criticism I got actually came from inside the community. So, with that being said, I wasn't wearing the T-shirt as a transgender woman saying I was gay. I was wearing it to simply show that I'm an ally of the gay community. With it I was saying, ""Hey, I'm a top model, I'm a public figure, and I'm saying this is OK."" So, despite the few negative comments, it turned out to be an amazing campaign, and I'm happy for it. Berusch: Great! Now what's next for you? What can we expect from Isis King? King: I've been freelancing as a model for a number of years now, but I just signed with JB Models in New York, so, I'm very excited about that. Also, I recently designed a women's collection for fashion week, which was very well-received. I will be designing a follow-up collection this coming fall for Spring 2014, and I'm really excited about that too. Berusch: For those of us out in the blogosphere, where can we find out more about you?King: You can read up and learn more about me through kingisis.com.Berusch: How about other social media? King: I can be followed on both Twitter and Instagram; [my] usernames are MsIsisKing. On Facebook you can reach me at facebook.com/IsisKingFanpage.Berusch: Awesome. This has been great. Thanks again!King: My pleasure! Ciao!"
6,QUEER VOICES,Spotlight on Isis King: Her Journey Into Self-Identity,"Martin Berusch, Contributor
Writer and Editor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/isis-king_us_5bafb2fce4b0ad7692604edc,"I have reached out and talked to someone whom I admire and who can share with us firsthand the experience of being transgender. Her name is Isis King, and she was the first-ever transgender contestant on America's Next Top Model.",2013-03-30,2013-03-29-20130325IsisKing23rdAnnualGLAADMediaAwardsArrivalsJYqVVCTl9SWl.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-03-29-20130325IsisKing23rdAnnualGLAADMediaAwardsArrivalsJYqVVCTl9SWl.jpg,"Current events on a global level are increasingly affecting our collective experience in how we view and position ourselves and others in the world. Whether we realize it or not, the exposure to new knowledge on a constant and increasingly frequent basis, along with increasing interaction between us all, is making us more receptive to accepting our incredible complexity and diversity. We are beings who have a lot more in common than one might think.When directing our attention to the transgender experience and focusing on the value that this segment of our community brings to bear, we will come to realize that, as a species, we are not so different from one another. In fact, it makes me believe that once we come closer to understanding one another, we will begin to truly respect each other's coexistence. If we turn our attention towards any number of countries and witness how the transgender community is increasingly becoming part of the mainstream, we will see how these changes are manifesting in very tangible ways. Looking outward, toward Argentina, where legislation is in place that allows people to identify with a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth (even without having gone through gender reassignment), or to Poland, where there are openly gay and trans parliament members decrying anti-LGBT sentiments in their country, or even to Cuba, where we see how nascent social acceptance has allowed a transgender woman to hold a community-level political position, the message is the same. The topic of transgender equality is an increasingly integral part of the general global conversation. In the interest of broadening the platform for this conversation in our own country, I seek to find that common denominator that makes us all more relatable to one another, to further open up the channels of communication in order to learn about, understand and accept each other, as much for our differences as for our similarities. I intend to look inward and experience my own humanness. As I do so, I have reached out and talked to someone whom I admire and who can share with us firsthand the experience of being transgender. Her name is Isis King, and she was the first-ever transgender contestant on America's Next Top Model.Martin Berusch: Isis, there are a lot of terms, definitions, preconceptions, prejudices and misunderstandings to cover when it comes what it means to be transgender in the United States. When thinking about transgender issues, many still seem confused between being transsexual -- if that's even still proper terminology -- and being transgender. What's the difference?Isis King: To me, being a transsexual doesn't equate to being transgender. A transsexual is someone who changes their body to be more of the opposite sex than the gender they were assigned at birth (born biologically). Transgender is more about how you feel inside, where you don't necessarily have to change your body's genitalia. I personally have never really identified with the word ""transsexual,"" just because of its negative connotation. Therefore, I still identify as transgender. Berusch: When did you first realize that you are transgender?King: I've known pretty much my whole life. As a 4-year-old child I realized that I was different.Berusch: When did you start showing outward manifestations of your true gender identity? King: During that same time. As a young child I liked playing with dolls, playing with girl things, or playing with girls in general. So I would say that at that point I was already starting to show who I really felt that I was. However, I learned early on to keep it hidden, because I would be ""corrected"" by family when they found me doing so.Berusch: You said that you had to keep it hidden when you were young. When you eventually told them, how did your family respond to your gender identity? Were they supportive?King: I think I didn't tell my mom until I was around 20 years old. So, you know, at first she was very hesitant about accepting it, but at that point I was already living in New York. I was focusing on my fashion career, or trying to, anyway, all while I was transitioning. I wanted to make sure that when I told my family, I was already able to support myself. The fact is that I was concerned with being rejected and losing my family's support. Therefore I waited until I could live on my own and do my own thing in a whole different state before I even mentioned how I really felt.Berusch: Does your background have any bearing on the decisions you have made: when you decided to talk about it, or when you decided to really show your outward manifestation of your gender?King: Definitely. I think it has everything to do with it. In the black community, especially where I grew up... I would say my school was probably 95-percent black. Growing up, I witnessed how some people were outcasts in my community. All I had to go by were the examples I saw growing up within that community. There was very little tolerance. Whatever didn't fit into the mold would be ""corrected,"" whether that meant getting beaten up, you know... There really was no good example. Berusch: Looking at gender identity vs. sexual orientation, when you were biologically a boy, a male, did you identify as or relate to being a gay male?King: When I was younger I lived my life as a gay male, but that's not who I was, although even though I knew who I was, I just didn't know how to fully express it -- that is until I was actually surrounded by others who were like me. I actually never came across any other transgender people until I moved to New York when I was 21. Berusch: Could you share some of your experiences growing up female in a male body? King: I do remember being a kid and seeing a documentary about someone that had a sex change and thinking to myself, ""Oh, wow, that's possible. That's me. I want that for myself."" As I got older, it was really frustrating because, after a while, some people started telling me that I needed to get a girlfriend. I felt like telling them, ""But I'm not a lesbian!"" Of course, I couldn't say that at the time, because everyone would have thought that I was crazy. It wasn't until I went to college that I got to explore and research transgender topics and could truly come to terms with myself. Berusch: And while you were growing up, was there anybody whom you could confide in and share your feelings?King: No, I didn't even want to set myself up for that. This is why I waited until after college, when I had the money to go move away and support myself, that I finally came forward and followed through on my transition. I ultimately felt that I was safest sharing this information with my family from a distance. My position was and is, ""I love you, but this is how it is, and I have to do what's going to make me happy, and I don't want your (potential) pain to affect my decision."" Eventually I did develop the courage I needed to tell my family, because I just knew I had no other alternative. I came to realize that I couldn't live my life for other people. Berusch: That being said, how do you see yourself fitting in today's world, given all the current social and political changes taking place? Let's say, hypothetically, that there was legislation in the United States that protected transgender people, and that self-identity became more accepted by the general population. Do you think you still would have gone through gender reassignment?King: Well, no matter how politics were to play out or how society would otherwise embrace transgender individuals, ultimately it would not have changed how I felt about my body. It simply wouldn't have affected the choice I made. Therefore, it would not have affected the outcome.  Berusch: Now, going back in time, I'd like to explore a bit of your personal journey toward womanhood. I was reading up on a documentary that NBC did in 2007 called Born in the Wrong Body, and you were featured in one of the segments. Could you talk a little bit about that experience?King: Yes. I was on the second segment of the series, which was called ""Born in the Wrong Body: On the Edge."" It was about girls that were in the ballroom scene, which I was a part of, for about a year. The documentary showed me going to visit my family: my mom, my aunt, my oldest brother. It had me designing and getting ready for a ball. It showed different aspects of me: me early on as a designer, way before I was modeling. [Laughs.] It just showed me during the time I started taking my first hormone shots. Berusch: You and I initially met a few years ago at an event for the Ali Forney Center, which is a shelter and intake center for homeless LGBT youth. Could you talk about your experiences at AFC? King: Sure. I moved to New York in late 2006, and I was renting out a room for six months. At the time I had a retail job, but I didn't work enough hours to cover the rent, so it got hard for me financially. When I ran out of money, I had to decide whether or not to move back home with my family, or if I was going to stick it out in New York City. I was living full-time as a woman but wasn't far enough into the transition to the point that somebody couldn't dissuade me from continuing with my transition. Because I wanted to avoid all that, I opted to move into the shelter, get their assistance and continue with my transition. Berusch: So the Ali Forney Center served as a support system for you? Did they also provide you with any kind of guidance as to how to move forward with the transition process you were undertaking? King: No, I wasn't their typical resident. I already had my mind made up and had a game plan with respect to moving forward with my transition. By the time I turned 21 years old, I had everything mapped out. Callen-Lorde Community Health Center guided me through most of my transition, while the Ali Forney Center served as a safe haven for me.Berusch: Got it. Now, moving forward to your first stint on America's Next Top Model in 2008. There's plenty of information about your experience, including behind-the-scenes moments. For example, ANTM showed you taking your hormone shots and the nausea that you experienced afterward. You gave us a little bit of insight into what it really means to go through this process.King: [Laughs.] More than just a little, Martin. It just so happens that these were just circumstances that I fell into; I didn't necessarily want to take hormones on national television, but in the end it [was worth it] because it educated [a lot of] people to some of the process.Berusch: You returned to ANTM in 2010, and Tyra Banks surprised you by introducing you to Marci Bowers, a fellow trans woman and a top gender reassignment surgeon, who offered to perform the gender reassignment. Is this correct?King: Yes, but I want to correct you and have you refer to it as genital reassignment surgery. Tyra introduced me to Dr. Bowers in 2008, and then I began the process of the genital surgery in 2009, while I was to appear again on Tyra's show.Berusch: It was an all-expenses-paid surgery?King: Yes. As I mentioned, during that time, I was working as a receptionist, saving my money. I'm proud that I was well on my way to saving enough to actually have my surgery on my own. But this opportunity did present itself through Tyra, and I accepted the helping hand.Berusch: What obstacles did you face, if any, when you decided to undergo the process of genital reassignment?King: I really didn't have any obstacles. Berusch: Could you speak of the process itself, from pre-screening to the psychological treatments that you might have undergone, to hormone therapy, to the actual operation?King: You know, it's funny. A lot of my experiences from that time are really a blur by now. I do recall the evaluations and obviously having the hormone therapy. I think at that point I just wanted to get it out of the way. I remember speaking in depth to counselors at Callen-Lourde, to my mom, to Tyra and others, the day before the operation. Then I remember going through the surgery, having my mom taking care of me and just going home after that. Berusch: How do you feel about your decision post-op? Any complications?King: Haven't had any complications. I am completely happy with this one most important decision I made in my life and have no regrets.Berusch: As you've gone through your transition, what changes have you witnessed in how you view life?King: It's not so much what has changed but what has remained constant. I knew for a long time what I wanted, and that was to present myself to the world in my true image. Everyone who I've interacted with, pre- and post-surgery, realized that I had been born in the wrong body. This has only reinforced that I am now in my own rightful body.Berusch: We now know that you now identify yourself as a heterosexual woman. Am I correct in saying that?King: Yes, correct. Well, I should also say that even though I am transgender, I've always identified as a heterosexual female, even before my surgery. That's just how I've always seen myself. Berusch: Are there any differences that you perceive in your day-to-day life?King: I can't say that I view anything in life any differently, because my mind hasn't changed. Mentally, my view of the world hasn't been altered.Berusch: How do you see others accepting you? Obviously you've become a role model and a celebrity in the LGBT community, and even beyond, into the mainstream audience. What kind of comments have people made to you about your journey?King: I've always received positive feedback from people. Many have approached me and told me how my actions have inspired them and have even prevented them from despair and from considering suicide. That, in fact, was the beginning for me to realize the power I had to make change. I became a motivational speaker and have become more outspoken about offering support to anyone willing to hear me out. Berusch: Any negative feedback?King: Any negative feedback has been minimal. I just don't give anyone the opportunity to make discriminatory remarks. That said, I always make the effort to always portray myself in a positive light and as a positive person. Berusch: No matter who we are, whether we are in the LGBT community, the mainstream or the rest of the world -- and when I say the rest of the world, I mean the Western world -- we are increasingly pressured into a youth- and beauty-oriented society. What are your thoughts on aging, and how do you think you will grapple with getting older and possibly losing your physical attributes?King: Good question! You know, my mom is my greatest role model. I always look to her and see how she herself is aging gracefully. The way I see it is that if I have half of her genes, then I should be OK. [Smiles.] Also, I think that I won't have a problem with getting older, because I am such a young spirit. Berusch: So, basically excluding the maintenance that you've committed to in order to optimize your feminine attributes, let's say, using hormone therapy, you won't be running to the doctor's office to get a facelift when that time comes. Am I correct in saying that?King: Yes. And I'd like to add that my hormone dosages are lower than before I had my genital reassignment. But to answer your plastic surgery question, to reverse aging? No, I don't think I see that happening. I actually like the person I now see in the mirror, flaws and all. [Giggles.] Berusch: But barring that, you are telling me you wouldn't be that 50-year-old rushing to get a touch-up?King: Well, hmm, I don't know. Who can say? All I know is that I don't dislike the person I see in there; I like who I see in the mirror, imperfections and all. You know, I don't have body dysmorphic disorder. I'm happy with who I am. Of course, that's not to say that I don't wish that I was curvier [laughs], but this is my body type. I could drink all the protein shakes and eat every meal in the world, but I'm skinny. These are things that I just have to accept, and I'm fine with that. So what do I do with that? I use it to my advantage and model. Berusch: Now, even though you say you don't suffer from it, you did mention body dysmorphic disorder, or body dysmorphia, which is when someone is preoccupied and excessively concerned with their body image. This is very different from body dysphoria, a clinical term (likely on its way to becoming outdated) that is pinned on transgender individuals to classify them as being depressed or otherwise emotionally distressed because of the incongruence between their body and their gender identity, and therefore deserving of treatment. The usage of ""body dysphoria,"" and potentially further confusing it with ""body dysmorphia,"" may conflate and perpetuate fundamental misunderstandings that exacerbate the prejudices faced by the transgender community.King: Exactly. Thank you for pointing that out. It's important that people understand this, so they don't say, ""I knew it, I knew it,"" referring to the issue being that the transgender individual is potentially acting out of a place of misguidance. I do want to say that dysmorphia is very prevalent among females, and perhaps and more so with transgender individuals, because they are kind of a ""blank slate"" due to their transitive state.

7,QUEER VOICES,Meningitis Vaccine Recommendation: 'Is It Good for the Gays?' and Other Pressing Public Health Questions,"Michael Broder, Contributor
Poet and writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meningitis-vaccine-recommendation_us_5bafb33be4b0ad7692605522,"How, if at all, should we reconcile the dictates of public health policy with the social, cultural and political concerns and sensitivities of specific populations? Another way of putting this is to ask whether the DOH recommendations are ""good for the gays.""",2013-03-30,"Brooklyn Bridge, East River and Lower Manahttan at dusk",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafb33b250000360037ef9c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My recent blog post on the New York City Department of Health's expanded recommendations for meningitis vaccination sparked some lively discussions and raised some provocative questions, prompting me to write this follow-up.My primary objective in the previous post was simply to alert readers that the DOH had expanded its meningitis vaccine recommendations to include all HIV-positive men in New York City who have sex with men, and all men in NYC who regularly hook up with other men for sex at bars or parties or through websites or apps, regardless of their HIV status. This represented a change from the previous recommendation, which had applied only to specific Brooklyn neighborhoods (Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Bushwick, Clinton Hill, Crown Heights, Downtown Brooklyn, Dumbo, East New York, Prospect Heights and Williamsburg), not to all of New York City.My secondary objective was to encourage readers to spread the word not only through mainstream channels like Facebook and Twitter but by posting a link to the DOH alert on their own gay social media profiles, especially given that health officials were cited in a New York Times article as saying that outreach to at-risk populations through gay organizations was difficult because not all men who have sex with men identify as gay or bisexual. However, some readers objected that I did not include enough medical information about the disease itself, including how it is transmitted and what the signs and symptoms are. Others had concerns about the DOH ""targeting"" gay men with their vaccine recommendations in a way that seemed stigmatizing and marginalizing. I addressed as many of these issues as I could in the comments, but I thought some of these questions warranted a fuller discussion, so here we are.First, a quick rundown on some of the medical facts. Meningococcal disease, commonly referred to as meningitis, is a severe bacterial infection of the bloodstream. Common symptoms include high fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck and a rash. Symptoms may occur two to 10 days after exposure, but usually within five days. While it is not generally considered a sexually transmitted disease, the DOH believes that the current strain is circulating specifically among men who have sex with men and may be transmitted during intimate encounters, including sexual encounters.Moreover, the outbreak has now spread beyond New York City. In a March 25 press release the New York State Department of Health revealed that a 23rd case had occurred, affecting a man who lives elsewhere in the state but spent significant time in the city. In response to this latest case, the New York State Department of Health has expanded the recommendations previously issued by New York City to include men who have sex with men who live outside New York City but have traveled to New York City and hooked up for sex with men they met at bars or parties or on websites or apps since Sept. 1, 2012.In the remainder of this post, I want to discuss how the medical questions and the political issues are inextricably linked, inevitably intertwined and hopelessly entangled. The big question, I think, is this: How, if at all, should we reconcile the dictates of public health policy with the social, cultural and political concerns and sensitivities of specific populations? Another way of putting this is to ask whether the DOH recommendations are ""good for the gays."" But is that really a reasonable question to ask when New Yorkers are dying of meningitis at an unusual rate and this elevated mortality appears to be occurring specifically among men who have sex with men, whether they identify as gay or bisexual or not?The DOH vaccine recommendations are based strictly on the epidemiologic evidence, ideally free from considerations of political expedience. In other words, the DOH epidemiologists look at the data they have collected on the people who have contracted the infection, and they say, ""OK, what risk factors for this infection did these people have in common?"" According to the DOH, this outbreak is occurring in New York City almost exclusively among men who have sex with men. That's where the data point, so that's whom the recommendations target (now expanded to include men who live elsewhere in the state but spend significant time in the city and meet the other risk criteria). A number of readers expressed frustration with the part of the recommendation that singles out men who hook up for sex at bars and parties and on websites and apps. Some felt that the DOH was targeting gay men based on ""lifestyle issues"" that had no medical relevance. However, here again, it's not a matter of nefarious Gayle Rubin-style assumptions about ""good sex"" and ""bad sex."" Rather, it's a matter of epidemiologic data and risk factor analysis. I asked the DOH why it was relevant that these men are meeting other men at bars or parties or on websites or apps. According to the DOH, these methods of meeting partners have come up repeatedly during their case investigations, making the very fact of hooking up via these venues or channels relevant to the definition of risk, and helping the DOH to focus its vaccine efforts.OK, fine, but sometimes gay men bring their straight friends, including straight female friends, to bars and parties with them. Or men and women, regardless of sexual orientation, might be working at these bars as bartenders, barbacks, bouncers, dancers or what have you. Why don't the DOH vaccine recommendations include them? Again, the data provide the basis for the recommendations. According to the DOH, rates of meningitis among New York City residents other than men who have sex with men are not higher than expected according to statistical norms. Thus, at this time, the vaccine is not recommended for members of any population group other than men who have sex with men. If the pattern of infection changes, the vaccine recommendations will change too (as they now have been expanded to include men from other parts of New York State who spend time in New York city and meet the other risk criteria). Finally, some readers thought that the whole alert was alarmist. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control, about 1,000 people in the U.S. contracted bacterial meningitis each year between 2005 and 2010. What qualifies 22 cases in New York City in three years as an outbreak, even with seven deaths? Isn't this well within normal occurrence rates? Again, the data drive the policy response. Outbreaks are defined as an unusual number of cases in a population. According to the DOH, the number of meningitis cases currently occurring among men who have sex with men is elevated and sufficiently unusual to qualify as an outbreak.Moreover, this particular strain of meningitis appears to be particularly invasive and deadly. Based on DNA fingerprinting, the DOH knows that the current outbreak is a variation of a strain that has been in New York City at least since 2003. According to the DOH, about 10 percent of the population can carry this bacteria in their mouth or nose at any time. Because this strain of meningitis can exist in this carrier state, it is much more difficult to eradicate. The vaccine offers protection, but many of the people who are at risk do not know they are at risk or do not believe that the risk is significant enough to warrant getting vaccinated. The DOH is particularly worried about this strain of meningitis, because it can cause illness very quickly, and almost a third of those who have become sick have died. That's why the DOH is insisting on the importance of vaccination for all men who have sex with men in New York City, regardless of HIV status, as soon as possible. Meningitis is not generally considered a sexually transmitted disease, but the DOH believes that this particular strain is circulating specifically among men who have sex with men and may be transmitted during intimate encounters, including sexual encounters.Now, I know perfectly well that the personal is political. I know perfectly well that the medical-industrial complex has used its knowledge and power to marginalize, stigmatize, harm and oppress vulnerable groups. I know all about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, in which the U.S. Public Health Service deceptively withheld treatment from black men enrolled in a treatment study in Macon County, Ala., from 1932 to 1972, to study the effects of untreated syphilis. My own brother, Frederick Owen Broder, was a victim of the hepatitis B studies at the Willowbrook State School for Children with Mental Retardation in Staten Island, N.Y., in which developmentally disabled children and adults were infected with live hepatitis from 1956 to 1971 in order to develop a vaccine. And, of course, I myself am a survivor of the AIDS epidemic, having testing HIV-positive in 1990 and endured years of no access to health insurance and no effective treatments until ACT UP brought the pharmaceutical industry to its knees and to the bargaining table so that lifesaving therapy was available by 1996, when I was still healthy enough to benefit from it.Is there a political dimension to the DOH vaccine recommendations? Of course there is. First, there's a political dimension in the original, Aristotelian sense that ""humankind is by nature a political animal"" (Greek ""ho anthropos phusei politikon zoon""), meaning a being that lives in cities (Greek ""poleis"") and has an interest in city affairs (Greek ""ta politika""). Second, there's a political dimension in the Foucaultian sense that medicine is a form of both knowledge and power that may be used to regulate the bodies and lives of citizens (""biopower""). And, finally, there's a political dimension in the sense of identity politics, the ""personal is political"" sense that I alluded to earlier, derived from feminist thought in the 1960s, whence it trickled into gay liberationist thought in the 1970s and remains a tenet of postmodern critical race, class, sex and gender theories. All these senses overlap and intertwine. And all these senses provide a basis for a critique of public health policy measures that categorize citizens according to their race, class, gender, sexuality or any other aspect of their identity. But in the case of the current meningitis outbreak in New York City and the DOH response to it, I think some folks are eager to pick a fight where none is warranted. In its handling of this meningitis outbreak, the DOH, far from being suspect, appears to be exemplary, following the epidemiologic data, not the social, cultural or political winds, and couching its recommendations in terms of ""men who have sex with men,"" rather than using terms like ""gay"" or ""bisexual"" that might exclude men who are at risk but do not identify with either of those labels. Are critics of the DOH identifying legitimate issues of race, class, sex or gender discrimination, or are they simply eager for a fight with the public health establishment because they miss the good old, bad old days of die-ins and human ashes strewn on the White House lawn? Here and now in New York City, we have a health department that is aware of social and cultural realities around sexual identities and sexual practices. We should praise such a health department. Indeed, we should celebrate such a health department as a victory for decades of struggle around civil rights, women's rights, LGBT rights and disability rights, not rail at it in misplaced, knee-jerk anger."

GPS For The Soul can help you find your way back to balance. GPS Guides are our way of showing you what has relieved others' stress in the hopes that you will be able to identify solutions that work for you. We all have de-stressing ""secret weapons"" that we pull out in times of tension or anxiety, whether they be photos that relax us or make us smile, songs that bring us back to our heart, quotes or poems that create a feeling of harmony, or meditative exercises that help us find a sense of silence and calm. We encourage you to look at the GPS Guide below, visit our other GPS Guides here, and share with us your own personal tips for finding peace, balance and tranquility.In her GPS Guide below, Heidi Hanna shares the tools, techniques and inspirations that encourage her to recharge. 1. Schedule a few three to five-minute ""brain recharge"" breaks through out the day to shift your mind out of task mode and into feeling mode. This allows you to cross train your brain instead of constantly breaking down one area or neglecting others. Set a timer, close your eyes and simply pay attention to the physical sensations of your breath: Your chest and belly expanding and contracting as you just focus on the present moment.  2. Start your day by writing down a few things you feel grateful for. This is a simple way to put on a lens of optimism; as you go about your routine you'll be more likely to focus on the positive around you. Set a reminder to reflect on these gratitudes several times throughout the day to create a habit of noticing what's good in life.  3. Meditate first thing in the morning: This can help to set the stage for a quieter, more creative mind throughout the day. Spend 10 to 15 minutes concentrating on a unique ""focus phrase"" -- something specific to you that helps you feel positive and focused like, ""be here now,"" or ""clear and present."" Find some more focus phrases in the slideshow below.

9,DIVORCE,The Dogs And Cats Of Relationships: Are You Over-Reading The Signs?,"Andra Brosh and Allison Pescosolido, Contributor
Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-dogs-and-cats-of-rela_us_5b9cfaa0e4b03a1dcc8377fa,Fighting like cats and dogs can be one sign that a couple may be heading towards divorce.,2013-03-29,Upset man having problem sitting on the bed with his girlfriend,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfaa02000003000fdc9d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fighting like cats and dogs can be one sign that a couple may be heading towards divorce. Often, couples get caught in the trap of over analyzing, misinterpreting and building resentments because of simple errors in communication. These errors lead to conflict, resentments and oftentimes contentious divorce. Men and women often think differently, whether the cause is the brain or behavior. It is no wonder that within our conflicting patterns of communication the wires get crossed. When communication begins to break down, there is a simple solution: stop searching for hidden meaning.  Relationships are fraught with language, and frequent breakdowns in communication can cause major challenges. There are words we use to directly communicate, the non-verbal cues of facial expressions and body language and even the short-hand of shared experience that couples use when in private. Language, however, has its issues. In any mode of communication, there is a disparity between the intent of the message and perceived meaning of the message. This can cause problems, as we try to find meaning in words or actions that may essentially be meaningless. Within a relationship, this search for meaning can be dangerous. Misunderstanding and manufacturing intent for a perceived message lays the foundation for eventual divorce.   Think of a dog and a cat. Their language, in fact their brains, read meanings in completely different ways. When a dog wags its tail it is saying, ""I'm happy; let's play."" When a cat's tail flicks its tail it is saying, ""I'm hunting; I'm about to pounce."" You can see the language barrier clearly when observing pets interacting. When a dog approaches a cat, tail waving excitedly, the cat will shy away. The cat perceives the dog's actions as a threat. The same problem occurs in reverse. A dog will approach a cat with a waving tail thinking that the cat wants to play -- until it gets a swat in the face.  We're the same way when interpreting the meaning of language, whether it's words, expressions or tones. Like the dog and cat, we need to keep from over-analyzing meaning behind the actions and words of others. When your significant other comes home from work with an attitude, it probably isn't you they are angry with. Or when your partner forgets that dinner with the Jones's is tonight, that doesn't mean they weren't listening. They probably have other things on their mind and trust you to keep them on track.  If your spouse doesn't directly tell you something is wrong, don't assume that his or her actions are about you. One of the hardest things for people to do in relationships is to stop the cycle of interpreting meaning where there is no meaning. Here are three questions you can ask yourself before getting upset.  • Is this a one time occurrence or part of a pattern? If its one time, drop it. Don't waste your energy on a fluke. If its a pattern that upsets you, address it with kindness and provide possible solutions. Keep in mind that the solution may involve changing your behavior. For example, if your spouse is always upset coming home from work, give them a little space. Leaving them alone for an hour will give them time to adjust from a rough day or long commute. • Am I over-reading? Like the dog and cat, we put meaning to actions and words. If your spouse says, ""I'm tired; can I skip the party tonight?"" they are probably just tired. They are not avoiding you or skipping your friends or family. Let them rest and feel comfortable going out on your own.• Am I communicating clearly? Are you wagging your tail and not getting the response you want? This could be a sign that your partner doesn't understand the language you are using. Instead of attempting subtlety, be clear with your intentions and actions. Facial expressions and body language might not be read correctly. If you don't directly state your feelings, he won't know them.  A healthy relationship involves communication. But that communication needs to be clear and understandable. We also need to stop over analyzing our relationships. Don't interpret all of your spouses actions as a message to you. They aren't. Your spouse feels and sees the world through their own filters. If they want you to get a message, they will explicitly tell you. Relax into your relationship. That's one key to happiness."

Make sure you're prepared both physically and emotionally.Everywhere we look these days, it seems, women are chopping off their long locks. Supermodel Karlie Kloss perhaps did it most publically in the pages of Vogue, and in reality one day before her debut in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, where they added extensions to her fresh chop. Despite VS's initial hesitance (they've since embraced it in campaigns), the blunt, swingy above-the-shoulders cut is totally having a moment, although for some it may take months of contemplation to go for it. ""Our society puts far too much pressure on long hair being the only thing that is viewed as pretty or sexy, when long hair often lacks style and is actually boring if it does not have the proper shape,"" says Shin An, master dry cutter and owner of Santa Monica's Shin salon.She adds that some women make up their mind to go for a dramatic cut while sitting in the salon chair, while others mentally prepare for the change for three to six months. And while we all know the trauma of a terrible haircut, ""at the end, it's just hair and it grows back,"" says An. ""Remember, hair is the one thing we can actually change about our appearance.""For those contemplating a look-altering haircut, start by ""doing your research. When you see a woman on the street and you like her hairstyle, ask where she goes."" Trust in your stylist is key. Research them, read reviews and ask questions of existing clients -- ""always trust your gut."" An also advises booking a consultation with that person before the real appointment to make sure you're comfortable with their vision. Sharing pictures of what you like helps, too. Then, ""it's up to the professional to explain what is realistic about your expectations, because in the end it's about creating a version of that inspiration while customizing the look -- not just copying it.""Psychologically, it can be hard for someone with long hair, which can tend to act as a security blanket, to shed all of it at once. Don't be afraid of taking baby steps toward your ultimate length goal -- and always, An advises, take a before and after photo. Seeing the two side-by-side can be very eye-opening. ""There is something very liberating about a complete change,"" she adds. ""It can help you transition to something new in life. Keep in mind that with a new look can come a new attitude.""With the right stylist, anyone -- no matter the face shape or hair texture--can have short hair, from pixies to An's favorite, a modern and sexy-chic ""shattered bob"" that grazes the shoulder or chin. Also important: not leaving the salon without learning how to manage and style the new 'do. ""Right now there are celebrities with many different styles -- risks are being taken, and I love it,"" says An.

13,DIVORCE,Learning Curves: 14 Divorce Lessons Every Divorcee Should Know,"Amira Young, Contributor
Writer, La Divorcee Vita",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/learning-curves-15-divorc_us_5b9cf716e4b03a1dcc8352bf,"When I left my husband, nothing could prepare me for what I faced next: nasty rumors, money issues, a vengeful ex, romantic feelings for someone I did not expect and an overwhelming sense of grief.",2013-03-29,Young Woman Relaxing On A Park Bench On A Clear Summers Day,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf7163c00004c0009f6f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I left my husband, nothing could prepare me for what I faced next: nasty rumors, money issues, a vengeful ex, romantic feelings for someone I did not expect and an overwhelming sense of grief. Divorce was new and frightening, and something I didn't know how to deal with emotionally. I was off on an adventure, but one on tumultuous seas.But as with any great adventure, I picked up a lot of funny stories, tender moments, and -- of course -- lessons to move forward with. They are things I will take to heart as I establish myself again and, hopefully, move on to a better love. I have learned...1. Not to care what people think. People are going to talk, spread rumors and take sides. It's the nature of divorce. But if you're going to recover properly, you're going to have to tune it out. Do whatever is right for you, even if it's not the most popular thing.2. To put myself first. I'm a self-admitted people pleaser, but you can't do that while trying to heal, otherwise you won't recover properly. Do what you need to do and focus on you. And for those with children, if you're happy, you'll have an easier time keeping your kids happy, too.3. Mourning is key. We may not think of divorce as a death, but it is the death of a relationship. Even if it was dead for a long time, you should do a certain amount of mourning. Grief is natural, and you shouldn't pretend your marriage didn't mean anything. It did. Process accordingly.4. To love myself. In marriage, I forgot about me; after divorce, I had to learn who I was all over again. We need to be okay with who we are on our own. After all, as RuPaul says, ""If you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you going to love anyone else? Can I get an Amen?"" 5. To have sex again. It's scary to move on in the bedroom, but divorced sex is too much fun to pass up. I have learned plenty of new tricks and preferences to bring to a new relationship; they're things I would have never known if I stayed celibate post-split. Don't be afraid -- let loose and have fun! 6. To take control of my finances. One of the most dangerous things I did in marriage was give financial control to my ex. The result was he hid money -- a lot of money -- and overpowered me. I'm still recovering financially. You should always know where your money is and how your finances are doing.7. The best support after divorce comes from fellow divorcees. I am lucky to have several friends who are going through their divorces at the same time as me. We prove to each other that we're not crazy and keep each other in check. Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us sane. If you don't have divorced friends, try to find a support group. 8. Those that judge your actions during crisis aren't worth your time. I did things over the course of my split that many of my friends didn't like. When thrown into an emotional crisis, we rebel and reshape ourselves in ways that may not always be positive. Good friends stand by you. They shouldn't cast judgment. 9. Not to let anger dominate. My ex's behavior towards me during our split, like making out with his new girlfriend very publicly six weeks after I left (also known as the way people found out about the divorce) and stealing money from me, was downright deplorable. I was so mad that I didn't realize he was reacting out of anger and weakness. Anger gets in the way of your heart and mind. Don't let it take over.10. To figure out where the marriage went wrong. If you are not owning part of the blame, look harder - it takes two to tango. I certainly made mistakes, such as trying to please everyone else so much that I didn't think about myself, picking the wrong partner and not being as open emotionally as I should have been.11. To laugh. Whenever we start to laugh again is when we truly begin the healing process. Once you find your humor, there is nothing stopping you down the path of recovery. Find joy in everything, and things will get better.12. It's okay to cry. Healing is not a linear process. Sometimes you'll take five steps forward, and then need to take three steps back and possibly have a mini-meltdown. It's all right to feel what you're feeling. You aren't superman (or woman) and don't need to be perfect.13. Know when you're ready for love again. Two months after I left my ex, I realized that I had feelings for a close male friend who I suspected felt the same way. He was someone I would have seriously considered marrying, but I was too emotionally unstable and not ready yet to get involved with him. Although our friendship suffered as a result, it was the right decision at the time for me. We are the only ones who can say whether we're ready or not, so listen to your gut. 14. Love is still the most powerful thing in the universe. My friends think I'm crazy to believe this after divorce, but love is a beautiful thing. I'm not talking real love, built on respect, communication and trust. The best part is that love takes many forms, like in friends and family. Cherish the love that's in your life.As Shakespeare said (and my father, who quotes him regularly), ""This, above all, to thine own self be true. And it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man."""

Every year",2013-03-29,"NEW ORLEANS, LA - FEBRUARY 02: Lil Wayne performs at the GQ Super Bowl party sponsored by Lacoste and Mercedes-Benzat The Elms Mansion on February 2, 2013 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

""The thing is, man, the bad news is, I'm an epileptic, I'm prone to seizures,"" Lil Wayne, who is 30, told Power 106's DJ Felli Fel. ""This isn't my first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh seizure. I've had a bunch of seizures; y'all just never hear about them. This time it got real bad because I had three of 'em in a row, and on the third one, my heart rate went down to, like, 30 percent. Basically, I could've died. So, that's why it was so serious.""He also noted that the seizures were brought on by too much stress and not enough rest. According to the Epilepsy Foundation, Lil Wayne is one of nearly 3 million people in the U.S. with the condition. Every year, there are about 200,000 people diagnosed with epilepsy. The condition is most common in the very young and the elderly, and it's more common for men to develop it than women. More than half of the time, there is no known cause for the epilepsy, the Epilepsy Foundation reported. When the cause is known, it's often from brain injury, brain development problems or illness, according to the National Institutes of Health.Epilepsy occurs when wrong signals are sent out by neurons in the brain. Electrical signal surges in the brain are what lead to the hallmark symptom of epilepsy: seizures. But having a seizure doesn't automatically mean a person has epilepsy, the Mayo Clinic noted. A person must have at least two seizures that are unprovoked in order to be considered epileptic; blood tests and neurological tests are often used to diagnose the condition. Not all seizures are alike, but they often have characteristics such as confusion, involuntary jerking of arms and legs, and losing consciousness. And part, or all, of the brain can be involved -- when it's just part of the brain that is causing the seizure, it's called a focal seizure. When all of the brain is involved, it's called a generalized seizure. Most of the time, epilepsy is managed with medications. But sometimes, surgery is a possible treatment when the exact part of the brain responsible for the condition can be pinpointed (what is called the ""seizure focus""), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Just recently, ""Fashion Police"" host Kelly Osbourne was hospitalized after she had a seizure during a taping of her show. Despite reports, the 28-year-old's representative noted that she has not received an epilepsy diagnosis from doctors, and that ""she is under a doctor's care and they are continuing to run tests,"" according to People magazine.
