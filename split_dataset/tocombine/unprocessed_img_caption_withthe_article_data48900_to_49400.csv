They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied ManbijMilitary Council told Reuters.“The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations,” Darwish said, adding militant sleeper cells in the city were still a threat.The SDF, with heavy air support from a U.S.-led coalition, said last week they had taken almost complete control of Manbij, where a small number of IS fighters had been holed up.The SDF’s offensive, which began at the end of May, aims to remove Islamic State from areas it controls along the Turkish border.The Manbij operation in which U.S. special forces have played a significant role on the ground marks the most ambitious advance by a group allied to Washington in Syria since the United States launched its military campaign against Islamic State two years ago.Manbij’s loss to the militants is a big blow as it is of strategic importance, serving as a conduit for transit of foreign jihadists and provisions coming from the Turkish border.Earlier the alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters grouped in the SDF said Friday’s operation was “the last operation and the last assault.”Darwish said earlier roughly 100 Islamic State fighters were left in the city center using civilians as human shields, some of whom were killed trying to flee.Reuters pictures showed residents being released from an Islamic State-held neighborhood on Friday and being welcomed by SDF forces.Kurdish sources and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors Syria’s five-year-old conflict, later said around 500 cars had left Manbij carrying Islamic State members and civilians. They were heading northeast towards Jarablus, a town under Islamic State control on the Turkish border, the Observatory said.The convoy carried the final Islamic State members leaving the city, under an agreement between the fighting parties that would not be announced officially, Kurdish sources and the monitor said, marking the end of the operation.The SDF’s campaign quickly captured the countryside surrounding Manbij, but slowed once fighting entered the city. The SDF said it had been avoiding a large-scale assault inside Manbijout of concern for civilians.Dozens of civilians, including children and women from Manbij who had fled the city at the height of the aerial strikes, were killed in suspected U.S. coalition air strikes last month, residents and monitors said.U.S. officials have said once the Manbij operation is completed, it would create the conditions to move on the militant group’s de facto capital of Raqqa. U.S. officials anticipate a tough battle.(Additional reporting by John Davison; Editing by Robin Pomeroy and James Dalgleish)"

He was less than two weeks away from his 82nd birthday, according to Baker’s website.His body was discovered on Saturday morning by a nephew, who had been looking after him, said his agent, Johnny Mans.The 3-foot-8-inch actor secured his big break in the first installment of the space saga in 1977 after performing in circus and cabaret shows around England. Baker would go on to play the world’s most personable droid in the “Star Wars” sequels and prequels, as well as consulting on 2015’s “The Force Awakens.”Although he was unable to attend the film’s Los Angeles premiere due to his illness, he did make an appearance at its European premiere in a wheelchair, posing with Stormtroopers on the red carpet. Apart from the “Star Wars” franchise, Baker also appeared in a variety of popular films throughout the 1980s, including “Flash Gordon,” “Time Bandits” and “Labyrinth.” “Kenny was truly a great friend, one of the nicest guys you could ever wish to meet and a fabulous and talented performer,” said Mans. “My wife and family will miss him terribly, and I will never forget the laughs we shared over the years. He was a one-off. There will never be another Kenny Baker.”Baker’s niece, Abigail Shield, told The Guardian that his death was sad, but expected, as his illness had worsened significantly in recent years. “He had problems with his lungs and was often in a wheelchair,” she said. “He was very poorly for a long time. He was asked to go out to LA for the new ‘Star Wars’ premiere but he was told he was too ill to travel. Luckily he did manage to meet George Lucas again when he came to Manchester.”Shield also notes that, because of his stature, Baker’s family didn’t expect him to survive after puberty, let alone make a name for himself in Hollywood. “He had a very long and fulfilled life,” she continued. “He brought lots of happiness to people and we’ll be celebrating the fact that he was well loved throughout the world. We’re all very proud of what he achieved in his lifetime.”Baker’s collaborators on “Star Wars” and others simply touched by his legacy rushed to pay tribute to the fallen actor on social media and beyond with heartfelt remembrances. His co-star Mark Hamill praised his determination and optimism, while director George Lucas described him as the “heart and soul of R2-D2.””Kenny Baker was a real gentleman as well as an incredible trooper who always worked hard under difficult circumstances,” Lucas wrote in a statement posted by New York Times reporter Dave Itzkoff. “A talented vaudevillian who could always made everybody laugh, Kenny was the heart and soul of R2-D2 and will be missed by all his fans and everyone who knew him.”This article has been updated to include reactions from Baker’s collaborators."

Well, the covers may provide some vital clues.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ae1ba91700002600c72df5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember “The Baby-Sitters Club” series? Me too! Baby sitters! A club! A girl named Stacey! The very essence of ‘90s childhood.Okay, fine, I never read “The Baby-Sitters Club.” Somehow, in all my Scholastic Book Fair–attending, middle-grade library section-rummaging, Barnes and Noble gift card–using adolescence, it never occurred to me to crack one of those babies open. And now, when I see “Baby-Sitters Club” cover outfits ranked, or speculation on where the gals would be now, I feel like a real chump. Fortunately it’s way easy to fake having read the books. Look at those covers! A picture is worth a thousand words, and a “Baby-Sitters Club” cover design might be worth 10,000 words, so meaningful is every detail. (I assume.)This week, in celebration of the series’ 30th anniversary, I finally committed to catching up with all of my generational lady cohort. That’s right: I looked at every single cover of the original 35 books penned by Ann M. Martin herself, and guessed each plot. I now feel confident that I can hold my own with the biggest “BSC” superfan out there. Looking for a cheat sheet? Read on for the plot of every original “Baby-Sitters Club” book, based solely on their covers:Plot: Kristy has a ~super great~ idea to turn all of her friends’ chill group hangs into work instead. Everyone plays along because tbh, Kristy is the Blair Waldorf of this book cover (I think) and no one wants to piss off a chick with that level of headband game.Plot: To cope with the crushing emotional burden of acting as a mother figure to an apple-cheeked toddler who would definitely be the focus of a national news frenzy if she left the stroller in Blockbuster by accident, Claudia starts calling into a singles phone line called GhostLines. She develops a huge crush on the mysterious boy on the other end of the call — but she has a sneaking suspicion that he for real is a ghost! Uh oh. Hijinks ensue.Plot: Stacey seems like a nice golden-haired girl who doesn’t remotely require the flesh of prepubescent children to nourish her ravenous body and her wicked, wicked soul. But actually, she has been fattening up unsuspecting kids on bonbons and cinnamon rolls before devouring them to satisfy a cannibalistic hunger she alone can understand. It’s a very lonely life.Plot: Mary Anne wanders in from an American Girl book, specifically Molly Saves the Day. In “BSC” world, she has to win the Camp Gowonagin Color War without the benefit of her prescription glasses. She has to squint real hard to see anything, even objects right in front of her.Plot: Dawn thought she’d be baby-sitting, but instead she’s taking care of three young kids who present her with challenges like “having facial expressions” and “standing next to her.” Finally, realizing only inhuman monsters would do such things, she bravely slaughters them and restores the world’s equilibrium.Plot: Someone is getting married, maybe, but no one cares because the only reason anyone even wanted to have a wedding is so Kristy could wear a bridesmaid dress and a flower crown. Everyone wants to grow up to be just like Kristy, especially the bride.Plot: Claudia cusses out her sister Janine in front of a small boy, but it’s totally her sister’s fault because Janine was being so, like ugh, am I right? Plot: Stacey will do anything to get boys to notice her ― even kidnap small children she’s supposed to be baby-sitting to offer to the cutest boys as tribute. It totally works. Aww!Plot: There’s a ghost at Dawn’s house.Plot: Mary Anne is into a guy who ... dun dun DUNNN ... is somehow a baby sitter himself, a super-suspicious choice of male after-school jobs. She ignores the red flag because he’s got the fluffiest hair, but he turns out to be a total perv. I mean, just look at what he’s doing to that poor kid.Plot: There are girls with even sweeter headbands than Kristy, and they own the sidewalks every day when they take their noble hound and their fluffy cat (hmm) for a stroll. Kristy needs to walk her dog too. FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!Plot: There’s a new girl in town, and she doesn’t allow baby-sitting. Claudia defies this decree, but the new girl’s threat of painful arm twists are too much.Plot: Stacey is leaving forever, but also she’ll be back soon. Everyone is super bummed and smiling. This book is very, very short.Plot: Baby sitters have a private club, and for some reason a girl named Mallory wants in. They try to pull her hair out. Middle-schoolers are little sociopaths.Plot: A bunch of little girls have gathered for some innocent, if gender-normative, fun by dressing up in tiaras and pretending to be beauty queens. But an ominous figure lurks behind the curtain ... ready to strike. A little trivia: This book was later adapted into a movie called “Drop Dead Gorgeous”!Plot: Jessi is a secret agent, and she’s learning a secret language to secretly report back to other operatives about the very important little boy she’s baby-sitting. Why? IT’S A SECRET.Plot: Mary Anne is a mysterious curse on helpless people around her, who are mysteriously injured in her presence. Why? IT’S A MYSTERY. And maybe she’s not a very good baby sitter.Plot: Before the big museum field trip, Stacey has been telling everyone that her favorite dinosaur is the triceratops. When she finally arrives at what she thinks is the triceratops exhibit, the sign says that it’s a brontosaurus. YIKES. Stacey is humiliated in front of all her friends.Plot: Oops! Claudia breaks her own leg to make her friends LOL, but in the process she makes herself vulnerable to velociraptor attacks after a nearby “Jurassic Park”-style laboratory suffers a security breach.Plot: This instructional book helps young readers learn about “walking disasters” by quizzing them on which person in a series of tableaux is the “walking disaster.” Which one is the walking disaster on the cover scene? You’ll have to read the book to find out!Plot: Mallory has twins. Her life becomes a hellscape of vomit, soiled diapers, tantrums and regret.Plot: A day in the life of a pet sitter, who cares for pets such as dogs, fish, bunny rabbits, human toddlers, ferrets and cats while their owners are out of town.Plot: Being at the beach has changed Dawn. Sun-kissed skin so hot, she’ll melt your popsicle, especially after she becomes best friends with Snoop Dogg!!Plot: Kristy forgot about Mother’s Day and goes to a carnival instead. Plot: Mary Anne is close friends with Tigger from Winnie the Pooh. When he runs away, Mary Anne leads the search party until Tigger is found in a big city flophouse, high on cocaine. That’s just the kind of friend she is.Plot: Claudia is halfway to being an adult and no one has told her about death yet, nor has she managed to figure it out on her own. This is pretty embarrassing. Fortunately Claudia’s grandma, probably, is able to sit her down and say “goodbye forever” before she dies. Warning for sad emotions!Plot: Eek! Jessi’s perfectly nice game of badminton is ruined when a TV star comes to town and she’s distracted by swooning over his hot bod. Thanks to the resulting leadership void, her badminton team falls into utter disarray, and they lose the tournament. Having caught the eye of the TV star, Jessi realizes too late that he’s a total narcissist ― after she’s run away with him to Thailand. How’s she gonna get out of this mess?Plot: Stacey has returned home to die.Plot: Mallory and the other baby sitters show a total lack of respect for other people’s privacy: A cautionary tale.Plot: Someone is getting married, maybe, but no one cares because this is Mary Anne’s big day. Plot: This book was later adapted into a Disney animated film, “Cinderella.”Plot: Susan plays piano. What a dweeb.Plot: Claudia suffers a delusive break from reality in which she becomes convinced she is the biological descendent of a wealthy and powerful royal family. Her parents are forced to send her to an in-patient psychiatric center for intensive treatment. It’s very painful for everyone.Plot: Mary Anne knows a place where the grass is really greener. Warm, wet and wild, there must be something in the water ... and all the boys are trying to sneak a peek at her. Except for the two very young boys she is acting as a primary caretaker for. Mary Anne has a crazy and sexually liberated spring break, which IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF, but her employers do relieve her of her baby-sitting duties for making out with too many dudes while she’s supposed to be on amateur lifeguard duty.Plot: Stacey has been Nancy Drew this whole goddamn time.Hit Backspace for a regular dose of pop culture nostalgia."

Saudi Arabia and its allies have launched thousands of air strikes against the Houthis since they drove the internationally recognized government into exile in March 2015.“@MSF received today 21 injured & 10 deaths in Haydan #Saada. All were under 15 years old,”said the medical aid group, also known as Doctors Without Borders, on its official Twitter account.Mohammed Abdul-Salam, a senior official from the Houthi movement whose main support base is in Saada, blamed the attack on the mostly Gulf Arab military coalition that has been at war with the group for over a year.At least 6,400 people have been killed in the conflict, around half of them civilians.The armed Houthis and their allies in the General People’s Congress (GPC) party headed by powerful ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh control the capital Sanaa and have so far withstood the coalition campaign.President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his internationally recognized government view them as putschists after they took the capital by force in September 2014 and have warned them against seeking to legitimize their rule through parliament.In a statement carried on the state news agency Saba, Hadi called the parliament session illegal and warned that MPs attending it could be prosecuted as criminals.After U.N.-backed peace talks to end the war collapsed last week, the Houthis and the GPC set up a governing council to rule the country despite U.N. and government opposition.The assembly convened within earshot of bombings by Saudi-led warplanes on military bases several miles away"

He’s the most powerful man in sports. He runs a league that practically prints money and is beloved all over the world. He is also becoming the biggest joke out there.Now, it doesn’t take much to convince a Patriots’ fan of this. Just mention the term “Deflategate” to any New England fan and you will hear chapter and verse on how terrible the commissioner is. Like it or not, however, the players agreed to make him the final decision maker, which likely played into Tom Brady’s decision to accept his punishment.But when Goodell starts exerting his over-authority regarding smaller issues, he becomes a joke. And when it involves denying a team the right to honor the victims of a terrible tragedy, it’s embarrassing.For anyone that wasn’t aware, the Dallas Cowboys requested the opportunity to wear a decal on the back of their helmets honoring the officers tragically slain in the ambush in Dallas. Well that wasn’t an acceptable idea, thanks to Roger and the NFL’s draconian uniform rules. As reported by FOX Sports, the NFL denied the request. Goodell and company went further than that, as Pro Football Talk wrote, by extending the denial into the preseason.What an embarrassment. A game that is the most popular in America can’t find a way to honor American heroes. Pathetic.The president of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation said it best:“The NFL had an opportunity to be leaders and advocates for change in law enforcement,” Sgt. Demetrick Pennie, president of the foundation, told the website. “”These are our friends and our loved ones... it hurts to not have the NFL fully support us.”He should be hurt. He should also be offended. Let’s see, who are those guys that make arrests of unruly fans? Policemen! Who helps keep the stadiums safe in the wake of attacks and potential attacks? Policemen! Policemen are employed by the league to keep games safe, fans safe, and events under control. They are an essential part of the game day process. But Roger couldn’t make an exception to the uniform rules and allow five of them to be honored? It’s apparently OK to break the rules to break those same rules to honor fallen members of the NFL family though. Whether it be players, owners, or in the case of Mr. Kraft, family members of owners, those are all acceptable. But it’s not OK to honor cops?By the way, the sainted Goodell had nothing to say when the Rams ran out of the tunnel for a game giving the “Black Lives Matter” salute. OK, it’s all right to protest cops, but not honor them?Seriously?It’s completely acceptable to have rules. It’s not acceptable to be a hypocrite. Roger Goodell is a hypocrite, and the Dallas police are owed an apology. His actions are embarrassing."
9,QUEER VOICES,This Gay Man Is 8 Months Into A Year Without Sex So He Can Donate Blood,Kira Brekke,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jay-franzone-gay-abstaining-sex-donate-blood_us_57ab6a22e4b0db3be07cc8c0,"""I’m proud of my decision. I stand by it and I really look forward to giving blood.”",2016-08-13,"ORLANDO, FLORIDA - JUNE 12: People wait in line to donate blood at the OneBlood Donation Center for the victims of a terror attack on June 12, 2016 in Orlando, Florida. 50 people are reported dead and 53 were injured at a mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in what is now the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The suspected shooter, Omar Mateen, was shot and killed by police. (Photo by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ae05ed1800002100bca77d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Twenty-one year old Jay Franzone wants to donate blood. Yet as a gay man, he’s legally banned from doing so because of a policy he calls “crazy” and “archaic” that unfairly discriminates against queer men. So, in order to do so ― and to take a stand against the the policy ― he’s taken a vow of abstinence for an entire year. That one-year marker is because of a 2015 Federal Drug Administration policy that bans any man from donating blood for 12 months since the last time they had sex with another man (it also bans any woman who has had sex with a man who has had sexual relations with a man in the last year). Prior to that, a lifetime ban against these men had been implemented in the 1980s near the start of the AIDS epidemic.“The FDA’s definition of sexual contact is oral, anal or vaginal sex, so it’s so overly-inclusive based on what we know HIV to be transmitted through,” Franzone told HuffPost’s Noah Michelson. “And so most high school gay people, they can never donate blood and they can’t go to Six Flags and get the free ticket. And so it’s that stigma there but it’s also then you can’t give blood, you can’t save lives and it kind of hurts.”In January, shortly after the FDA changed its policy, Franzone embarked on his year of abstinence. It’s not something he wants to do by any means, but it’s what men who have sex with men are forced into if they want to donate blood. “For me, I have friends who are always like, ‘Oh I want to go to the Himalayas’ or ‘I want to go climb Mt. Everest,’” he said. “And I want to give blood.”At the time of his decision, Franzone wasn’t in a relationship but he started dating someone in March. The conversation about his decision to abstain from sex organically came up between the two of them while at a TED Talk about health care. Franzone’s boyfriend “was fully supportive and really encouraging.”“It was kind of like ‘Well then why are we going to have sex? You should keep doing this,’” Franzone said, recalling the conversation with his then-boyfriend. The two have since broken up, but removing sex from their relationship was a “powerful” experience, Franzone said. It enabled them to get to know each other in a different capacity. “It wasn’t us trying to run to each other’s rooms,” Franzone said. “It was us exploring the city and knowing each other and getting to know each other’s lives, which was really really cool and something that I think I can take away from this experience and hopefully bring to future relationships where I’m not staying abstinent for a year.”Public outrage and conversations over queer men’s ineligibility to donate blood were reignited in June after a massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida left 49 people dead and 53 people injured. There was a massive need for blood donations to help the wounded but so many within the LGBTQ community were banned from giving. “It’s like a terrible irony that our community’s hit and then we can’t give blood to help them,” Franzone said. Franzone, who will graduate from Lasell College in the fall with a political communications degree, is focused on ending the ban in a professional capacity as the director of communications for the National Gay Blood Drive. Members of Congress and lawmakers have also called on the FDA to change its policy to make it less discriminatory.Franzone said there needs to be more public awareness and outrage about the “archaic” policy and how current technology can test for HIV in just 10 days. “Once you’re infected, you can get a result in 10 days and that’s fully accurate with nucleic acid testing so we’re testing for the DNA of the virus,” he said. “Before in the ‘80s, it took months, 56 days, for an HIV test to come back. So looking at the science and also realizing this is about risk. This isn’t about sexual orientation.”Over his coming months of abstinence, dating isn’t out of the cards for Franzone, who went public about his decision after the Orlando shooting. “There’s so many other things you can do,” he said. But for now, Franzone is thinking big picture until the year is up. “I’m kind of putting it on my forehead and being very upfront with this because this isn’t something that I want to hide,” Franzone said. “I’m proud of my decision. I stand by it and I really look forward to giving blood.”Watch the full conversation with Jay Franzone below:"

Befriending what we haven’t chosen is also a practice.,2016-08-13,Abbot Steve posing in his robes with fire gear after the 2008 Basin Complex fire.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57af741a1700002301c73019.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I die, don’t say I battled cancer. Please say I befriended it.I don’t have cancer—yet—but the person I’ve shared my life with for the past 15 years does, as do many others I love. Breast cancer runs in my family. It’s probably just a matter of time until the suspicious finding on the mammogram turns out not to be benign. I’ve borrowed this idea of befriending from a man who died of an aggressive pancreatic cancer in 2013 and modeled how to meet his own death with a radical curiosity.I got to know Myogen Steve Stücky, former abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center, while writing a book about the wildfire that nearly burned down Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, a sister temple, in 2008. Abbot Steve, as he was affectionately called, led the decision by five resident priests to turn back during an evacuation. They saved Tassajara with no professional backup. Abbot Steve, who grew up laboring on a farm in Kansas, told me it was among the most intense work he’d ever done.During and after the fire, Abbot Steve talked about meeting it as another neighbor in the valley. He spoke of “getting to know the fire” and having a “relationship” with this element that is an essential part of the ecosystem. He thought of the fire as a friend that required strictness and boundary setting. He recognized the fires within—the flames of digestion and cognition, the heat of feelings.In the fall of 2013, five years after he’d helped save Tassajara, Abbot Steve got a terminal diagnosis. He treated the cancer, but when he saw that it had gained too much ground for him to survive, he accepted his situation and turned his attention to dying with as much awareness as he could muster. He danced with death, like he danced with fire, remaining open and fully engaged even as he suffered grave losses and felt intense pain.In an October 2013 blog post, not long after his diagnosis, he turned his shocking situation into an opportunity for reflection: “It is three weeks tomorrow that I started my new life. I am learning things every day.” Note: new life.In early November, Abbot Steve reminded his students, “This is a good time to examine the reality of impermanence in all of our lives. And to continue to express our love for each other.”Abbot Steve was the last person anyone expected to get sick and succumb to illness. Like my uncle Paul Reinhart, a distance runner who never smoked and died of metastatic lung cancer, certain vexing questions arose. Why me? Why this deadly cancer? Why this awful pain?Abbot Steve met these questions whole-heartedly.Around Thanksgiving, he wrote: “The ‘practice of gratitude’ for me begins simply with saying the word ‘gratitude’ and allowing whatever arises in thought to be regarded as loveable no matter who or what it may be. This...acknowledges that everything, absolutely everything is fully participating in the fact of my existence this moment.”He went on, “These days...I wake up and say ‘gratitude’ and the next thought is ‘pain in the belly’ or ‘cancer’ or it’s ‘not fair!’ To accept such thoughts with gratitude may be impossible and even contribute to further unwholesome states of mind. So, it is realistically healthier to enter this practice by creating a field of positive energy by first naming what you know from experience is nourishing for you.”Because I was telling a story in which the threat of death was real and present, I asked Abbot Steve about death often. People died during the course of my working with him—his mother, dear friends. Abbot Steve used those occasions to talk about grief as a teacher, as something that asks us to realize the truth of impermanence. We grieve because we love, because we hold close what cannot be held on to. Because as humans, we have attachments, first and foremost to our own lives.Gratitude is a practice. Befriending what we haven’t chosen is also a practice. And the two are intimately connected. I know that if myeloma were on the march—eating away at my husband’s bones and clogging his kidneys—or if I were facing a terminal diagnosis, to welcome my experience without resistance would be difficult.But as I write this, fire is burning towards Tassajara again. And even as I hope for Tassajara’s safety, I respect the fire. I acknowledge that it too is “fully participating” in its life.Of course, we try to keep a wildfire or cancer from destroying what we love, but whatever comes, I won’t use the word battle. It creates an unhelpful opposition, as if cancer or wildfire were separate from us rather than potential teachers or invitations to transformation. Making enemies just isn’t the response I want to choose. To become defensive is to harden, and when I harden, I miss so much. Things have a tendency to deflect off of me—essential things like love and the warmth and wonder of life.When that final fire came for him, Abbot Steve lived his dying as he’d lived his life—not pushing away what was difficult or unknown, expanding even as physically he wasted away. He died with a slight smile on his face.Thank you, Abbot Steve, for that beautiful example of—not surrender—but letting go."

The rent is high, there are pretty much always huge piles of trash bags everywhere and if you live here long enough, you’re probably going to get bedbugs.And now, a DNAInfo article published Friday has the whole city panicking about flying cockroaches.The article, titled “Roaches Love This Disgusting Heat So Much, It Makes Them Want To Fly,” has sparked a series of additional news stories and panicked social media posts about roaches launching themselves through the air.But a closer look reveals New Yorkers can probably calm down about flying cockroaches. A little.First of all, not all cockroaches are apt to go airborne.There are two main types of cockroaches that live in the New York area — German cockroaches and American cockroaches, according to New York City company Positive Pest Management. German cockroaches are more commonly found near dishwashers, stoves and sinks, while American cockroaches are more likely to be found in basements, in bathtubs and near drains.American cockroaches are the ones that may start flexing their little wings in the summer heat, insect experts told DNAInfo. In cooler temperatures, they tend to walk or run rather than fly.Louis Sorkin with the American Museum of Natural history told the outlet that more heat gives the critters “more use of their muscles” and “the more activity, the more flight.”And secondly, they aren’t “flying” so much as using their wings to glide between short distances, like from a higher place to a lower place. In other words, they aren’t “true fliers as you would define a bee or a dragonfly,” entomologist Hao Yu told DNAInfo.Not that we’re exactly psyched about “gliding” cockroaches, but it does seem slightly less unnerving.And finally, look on the bright side. Sure, cockroaches are gross-looking and spread disease, but in a lot of ways they’re pretty cool. They’re badass survivors and they actually play an important role in the ecosystem by helping vegetation decay.Are these the frenzied rationalizations of someone faced with the horrifying prospect of flying cockroaches? Yes."

In the video that TMZ first published Friday, Depp appears to be in a fit of rage over an unknown incident that occurred earlier in the day. He storms through the kitchen slamming cabinets, breaking objects and yelling expletives, all while interrogating Heard. “Nothing happened this morning, you know that?” she tells him. “I just woke up and you were so sweet and nice – we were not even fighting this morning. All I said was sorry.”He then approaches Heard, who reportedly filmed the video that sources in Depp’s camp reportedly claim is “heavily edited,” to pour himself a large glass of wine. “You want to see crazy? I’ll give you crazy,” he says. “Here’s me – all your crazy.”The feed is abruptly interrupted moments later when he apparently discovers that he is being filmed and appears to wrestle the phone away from Heard. The last sound we hear is the phone being slammed on the ground. Sources in Depp’s camp say that the footage was an attempt to legitimize Heard’s accusations that the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor abused her throughout their 15 months of marriage, according to TMZ.However, Heard denied Saturday that she was the one to release the video on Saturday, the gossip site later reported, after arriving in Los Angeles for the deposition. Watch the video below: We have reached out to Amber Heard’s and Johnny Depp’s representatives and will update the post accordingly. "

Author: Human Rights WatchThe 31 armed men who took over a police station in Armenia's capital of Yerevan on July 17 made two demands that got widespread news coverage.After the 20 men who were still in the station on July 31 surrendered, the group made another appeal to the public.This time it wasn't a demand. It was a entreaty that they embrace what they felt was another important political objective. That objective was for Armenia to stop being a Russian colony and become independent in fact as well as in name.One of the group's demands when it seized the police station was that the government release the man they considered their leader -- Jirair Sefilian, head of the Founding Parliament fringe political party. Authorities had arrested Sefilian in mid-June on a charge of plotting a coup.The other demand of the occupying group known as the Daredevils of Sassoun was that President Serzh Sargsyan resign.The government wore down the Daredevils during the siege, cutting off their water, food, electricity and cellphone service, and wounding several of them with sniper fire.Hardening authorities' determination not to compromise was the fact that two police officers died during the occupation. One was shot during the initial takeover and the second by sniper fire halfway through the siege.The Daredevils are now going through the justice process. They face long prison terms, but they are still defiant, maintaining that they are not common criminals but prisoners of war.A longtime political activist decided on the very day that the Daredevils surrendered to try to increase public awareness of their contention that Armenia needs to stop being a Russian vassal.Tigran Khzmalyan stood in front of a small group of Daredevils sympathizers outside Yerevan's Opera House to read an online post the Daredevils had made.""Today all the processes in our country are governed from outside,"" he quoted the Daredevils as saying. ""I am speaking about Russia.""""We want the people, and the international community, to realize that this is a national liberation movement against Russian colonialism,"" the Daredevils said.Although the Daredevils represent a political fringe group, many Armenians believe as the Daredevils do that their country needs to cast off its Russian shackles.Russia owns the country's electrical system and supplies it with most of its gas, making Armenia beholden to the Kremlin for its energy needs. The Russian electricity company's decision to raise electricity rates 17 percent last summer led to tens of thousands of people protesting nationwide.Many Armenians also resent Russian President Vladimir Putin bullying Sargsyan into dropping Armenia's plan to join the European Union and instead joining the Kremlin-led Eurasian Economic Community. Sargsyan's about-face in the fall of 2013 was greeted with demonstrations in Armenia, and additional street protests when Putin visited the country later that year and in 2014.Many Armenian intellectuals and young people in particular resented Putin's interference in Armenia's effort to shape a better economic future by looking toward Europe.There is also growing resentment about what many Armenians see as Russia's interference in the Nagorno-Karabakh situation.Putin has been personally trying to mediate a settlement of the longstanding dispute, which flared into open warfare in April of this year.The ethnic Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh fought a war with Azerbaijan over the enclave from 1988 until 1994. Both sides continue to claim that the area is theirs, with flare-ups in fighting punctuating their claims.Putin has said publicly that the two sides need to reach a compromise on the issue.Armenians, who of course back their ethnic brethren in Nagorno-Karabakh, are afraid that Putin will demand, as one term of compromise, that the enclave cede some of its land to Azerbaijan.Many of the Daredevils of Sassoun fought in the Nagorno-Karabakh War between 1998 and 1994, as did Sefilian, so they are dead-set against a settlement involving loss of land.Many Armenians also resent the fact that in recent years Russia has been selling arms to both Armenia and Azerbaijan.Russia has justified sales to both sides as an attempt at maintaining balance in the region.It has also said that if it weren't selling arms to the Azerbaijanis, somebody else would be. The gist of that cynical message: Why should we give up profits that we don't have to give up?No polls on Armenian public sentiment about Russia have been taken for at least two years, as far as I know.So there are no figures to confirm the anecdotal evidence I'm seeing that indicates more Armenians are becoming tired of being a Russian colony.Thousands of protesters turned out to support the Daredevils of Sassoun during the police-station siege, indicating that the group had succeeded in galvanizing opposition to the government that went way beyond the membership in the tiny Founding Parliament Party.Will their movement also stoke a broader effort for Armenia to get out from under Russia's thumb?I wouldn't bet against it.Armine Sahakyan is a human rights activist based in Armenia. A columnist with the Kyiv Post and a blogger with The Huffington Post, she writes on human rights and democracy in Russia and the former Soviet Union."

Most of the time, we provide our own rant at the end of the column, on a subject too big to be contained in talking points. This week, we provide a number of rants from Republicans about their very own party's presidential nominee. Yes, it's only August and the Republican Party is coming apart at the seams. Which, of course, makes for great summertime reading for all!Before we get to all the Republican-on-Republican violence, though, we've got to cast an eye over the week that was. If there's one thing that is unmistakably true about Donald Trump it is that he just can't help himself. You can read that literally -- nothing he seems to do ever improves his standing with the general electorate -- or as a metaphor for Trump's inability to stop saying silly and outrageous things in public. Either way, Trump certainly does pack a lot into a single campaign week, and can probably be expected to continue doing so right up to Election Day.This was (as were many other previous weeks in the campaign calendar) supposed to be the week when Donald Trump successfully ""pivoted"" and turned everything around. To say that didn't happen would be an understatement. Hillary Clinton had a mini-scandal break that even involved emails, and yet it was barely a story in the political world (the emails weren't all that damning, even to anti-Clinton types) -- because Trump was, once again, sucking up all the oxygen.Trump started the week off with a serious, read-from-a-TelePrompTer speech on the economy. This was the big pivot, folks! Everyone look -- Trump's being serious. Right up until he mispronounced the word ""cities,"" inexplicably replacing the ""c"" with a ""t."" So much for being serious.Later in the week, Trump claimed that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton got together a few years ago and said to each other: ""Hey, we've got some free time, why not start a jihadist group in Iran and Syria?"" No, really -- Trump claimed both Obama and Clinton were not only ""founders"" of the Islamic State, but apparently also that the Islamic State has somehow become a sports league who hands out ""most valuable player"" awards -- which would, of course, go to Obama and Clinton. Got all that? When gently asked to perhaps rephrase his statement a bit, Trump (of course) declined.Trump also proposed during the week that U.S. civilians accused of terrorism either be sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or be tried in military tribunals. This remark, while shockingly unconstitutional, kind of got lost in the whirlwind, though.Much more attention was paid to Trump using the ""Second Amendment people"" dog-whistle to a crowd, suggesting that perhaps guns would be the best answer if President Hillary Clinton ever started trying to appoint federal judges.Once again, any one of these statements would have been a career-ender for just about any political candidate imaginable, but then Donald Trump is beyond ""imaginable"" and always has been.Trump utterly blew his planned pivot to seriousness, pretty much all week long. He even blew a chance to rip into Clinton for having the Orlando shooter's father behind her at a rally -- while congressional-page-enthusiast Mark Foley was sitting right behind Trump. It's like we've all fallen into a bad Hollywood script that would never have been greenlighted for a movie, or something.While Trump continues to absolutely tank in the polls (including all of the swing states he would need to claim victory), the Republican National Committee is apparently getting a wee bit nervous. They're holding what is being described as a ""come to Jesus"" meeting with Trump campaign staffers today, so who knows what will happen next? Some prominent Republicans are already publicly calling for the R.N.C. to direct all its money away from Trump and instead towards desperately trying to hold onto some Senate and House seats, but we'll get to that in the talking points section.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's campaign has pulled all advertising out of Virginia and Colorado, because they consider those two swing states in the bag for Clinton. Instead, they're expanding operations in (are you sitting down?) Arizona and Georgia. No wonder some Republicans are already darkly muttering about the impending landslide that's going to bury Trump. Hillary Clinton even wrote an op-ed for a Utah paper, a formerly reddest-of-the-red state that could also flip for her.Team Clinton is almost gleeful in their triangulation plans, at this point. Hillary is reaching out to Republican voters everywhere, but in doing so she risks generating some backlash among progressives, who already mistrust her. But the confidence being exuded by the Clinton campaign is palpable, and today Hillary released her 2015 tax return while taunting Trump to do the same (with a new ""What's he trying to hide"" ad).All that, in one week. Whew! And it's only August... things will undoubtedly speed up even further in the coming months. But for now, let's move right along to the awards.Senator Bernie Sanders gets a Honorable Mention this week, for clearly denouncing the decision made this week by the Drug Enforcement Agency to keep marijuana on Schedule I, a definition that includes the phrase ""has no currently accepted medical use"" -- even though half of the United States have now legalized medicinal use. Sanders is also co-sponsor in the Senate of a bill that would throw the legal issue to the states once and for all. See my column from yesterday for more details about this backward-facing decision, but it's good to see a politician who isn't afraid to get on the right side of history in such fashion.But the Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week this week goes to none other than President Obama. What with everyone intensely watching all the polling surrounding the presidential race, Obama's job approval numbers haven't been in the news of late. They should be, however.This week, on the Real Clear Politics tracking page, Obama sits at 51.9 percent approval from the public, with only 44.2 percent disapproval. Those are better numbers than he's seen since the second month of his second term, three-and-a-half years ago. Obama not only has been rising all year long, but he also got a convention ""bump"" in the polls on top of it. This should cheer up Hillary Clinton, because presidential job approval polling is very predictive of who will win in November. If Obama keeps his numbers above 50 until then -- as now seems entirely possible -- then Clinton might just be a shoo-in.There's a simple explanation for this trend. It's not because of some big legislative victory Obama just won in Congress (Congress has barely done anything this year). It's not because of some dramatic foreign or domestic policy win, either. Obama is rising in the public's estimation because people are now being seriously confronted with the two candidates who might be our next president. In other words, the more the public pays attention to the 2016 campaign, the better they think of the job Barack Obama is doing.One of the most amusing moments at the Democratic National Convention was hearing, during President Obama's speech, several shouts of ""Four more years!"" (even though this is constitutionally impossible). It seems a whole lot of other people are going to miss Obama when he's gone, and his spike upwards in the polls to almost 52 percent approval wins President Obama this week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week.[Congratulate President Barack Obama via the White House contact page, to let him know you appreciate his efforts.]We almost didn't have anyone to give this week's Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award, but one really stupid gaffe caught our eye at the last moment.Congressman Patrick Murphy is running in the Democratic primary in Florida to be the Democrat to take on Marco Rubio. While criticizing Donald Trump (and his ""hatred and fear-mongering""), Murphy had the following to say, to Jorge Ramos:We are stronger as one, as a united country. That's what makes this country so beautiful and so unique. You know, you think of the Statue of Liberty, right? And all of us. I'm an immigrant. We're all basically immigrants here. And you think of that beacon of hope, of opportunity, and Trump is tearing that apart. And that is scary to me.Except that he's not actually an immigrant. From his own official biography page, he was ""born and raised in Florida, spending most of his childhood along the South Florida coast."" He's also already gotten into trouble about exaggerating his own history during his campaign -- which would tend to make you a lot more careful about what you say, you would think.Reasonable people can interpret this as a weak attempt at a sweeping statement. ""I'm an immigrant,"" Murphy says, in the same spirit that we were all Charlie Hebdo, in other words. ""Most Americans are,"" Murphy might have said, ""if you go back far enough in their family, immigrants."" Unfortunately he didn't say that. He said ""I'm an immigrant"" when he most decidedly is not one. In Florida, where a lot of people care about that particular distinction.This was a stumble, not an enormous fall. As we said, it almost doesn't even reach the level of the MDDOTW award, but for his political misstatement he was more disappointing than any other Democrat this week, so we decided to go ahead and give Murphy the award anyway.[Contact Representative Patrick Murphy on his House contact page, to let him know what you think of his actions.]Volume 403 (8/12/16)It is extraordinarily rare for prominent members of a political party to publicly denounce their chosen presidential nominee. It's so rare in normal elections that it becomes big news immediately. This election, however, it has become almost commonplace for Republicans to repudiate Donald Trump's candidacy. As a mark of how commonplace it is, we had not just one scathing indictment of Trump and his campaign this week, but three.The first is from Republican Senator Susan Collins, of Maine, who penned an op-ed piece in the Washington Post, explaining why she cannot bring herself to vote for or support her party's nominee. The second was from a group of 50 national security professionals stretching from the Nixon administration to the Cheney administration (whoops, we meant to say the ""Bush administration,"" obviously). Kidding aside, these are the serious foreign policy types on the right, and they not only stated they weren't going to vote for Trump, they predicted that if he wins he will be ""the most reckless President in American history."" And the third public evisceration of Trump came from 70 Republicans who called on the Republican National Committee to ""immediately halt all support for Donald Trump and invest its resources in a real and winnable campaign to save the Republican Senate and House.""So with that wealth of anti-Trump material coming from his own party, it seems almost redundant to come up with Democratic talking points this week. There is plenty of material available -- just in the past week alone -- that badmouths Trump worse than we could hope to do. So we're just going to provide excerpts from these three documents, with a bonus quote at the end, just for the heck of it.Senator Susan CollinsSenator Collins started her opinion piece off with a flat statement: ""I will not be voting for Donald Trump for president."" She explains how she struggled with this decision, but Donald Trump just made it harder and harder for her to explain away his own behavior.With the passage of time, I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize. But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing -- either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level -- that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president.Collins then lists her three incidents -- Trump mocking a reporter for his disability, Trump stating that a judge born in Indiana couldn't possibly be fair to him because of his ""Mexican heritage,"" and Trump's attacks on the Gold Star parents who appeared at the Democratic National Convention. Each time, says Collins, she ""waited in vain for Mr. Trump to retract his words."" Then she begins painting a larger picture.I am also deeply concerned that Mr. Trump's lack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so. It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies. Mr. Trump's tendency to lash out when challenged further escalates the possibility of disputes spinning dangerously out of control.Pretty harsh, but this was actually the kindest towards Trump of the three documents released this week. Which brings us to the next one, from the foreign policy experts.National security officials' letterThis extraordinary letter also starts off (after an introductory paragraph explaining who the group is) with a blanket statement: ""None of us will vote for Donald Trump."" Once again, these are all Republicans, not some partisan sniping by Democrats. This letter minces no words whatsoever.From a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. Indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous President and would put at risk our country's national security and well-being.The letter ends by first explaining all the qualities and temperament necessary for any president (willing to listen to advisors, acknowledge errors, be disciplined, etc.). Then it tears into how far Trump falls short:In our judgment, Mr. Trump has none of these critical qualities. He is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood. He does not encourage conflicting views. He lacks self-control and acts impetuously. He cannot tolerate personal criticism. He has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior. All of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be President and Commander-in-Chief, with command of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.C'mon, guys, tell us what you really think! Sorry, but at some point you just have to laugh at the language fellow Republicans are using against their own candidate. This letter lays out one targeted idea -- Trump being unfit to handle foreign policy -- while the next brings a very different focus.Begging the RNC to bail on TrumpThe third letter is entirely political in nature, since it was addressed to Reince Priebus and the Republican National Committee. It begs the R.N.C. to ditch Trump in no uncertain terms, from the second paragraph onwards.Given the catastrophic impact that Donald Trump's losing presidential campaign will have on down-ballot Senate and House races, we urge you to immediately suspend all discretionary RNC support for Trump and focus the entirety of the RNC's available resources on preserving the GOP's congressional majorities.They have already given up on winning the White House, obviously, and are now terrified that they are facing a disastrous landslide in November.We believe that Donald Trump's divisiveness, recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking unpopularity risk turning this election into a Democratic landslide, and only the immediate shift of all available RNC resources to vulnerable Senate and House races will prevent the GOP from drowning with a Trump-emblazoned anchor around its neck.""Evaporating by the day"" -- that has a nice ring to it, don't you think? The letter then lists all the reasons why Trump has already ""alienated millions of voters of all parties,"" most of which are specific but also including a few catchall items on the list, such as: ""Exposing his total ignorance of basic foreign policy matters,"" and: ""Deliberately and repeatedly lying about scores of issues, large and small."" They even slam Trump for not releasing his tax forms, then continue in the same vein.Those recent outrages have built on his campaign of anger and exclusion, during which he has mocked and offended millions of voters, including the disabled, women, Muslims, immigrants, and minorities. He also has shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies, including threats to ban an entire religion from entering the country, order the military to break the law by torturing prisoners, kill the families of suspected terrorists, track law-abiding Muslim citizens in databases, and use executive orders to implement other illegal and unconstitutional measures.Since it's a letter with a political focus, it then turns to the dismal polling they've been seeing:[C]urrent polling gives Trump barely a 15 percent chance of being elected president in November. That polling projects a potential 350 electoral vote blowout for Hillary Clinton, including a sweep of every battleground state from Florida to Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado, Virginia, and North Carolina. Trump's across-the-board collapse has put even Republican bastions like Georgia and Arizona in play.That's a pretty apocalyptic statement for the beginning of August! It's understandable when people get nervous a few weeks out from an election, but the general election has barely begun, and these Republicans are already worried about Hillary Clinton getting 350 electoral votes.The letter then itemizes Trump's refusal to support members of the Republican Party, which includes things like calling an ""incumbent Republican Senator a 'loser' to his Senate peers,"" and ""Repeating his false and outlandish claims that yet another Senator's father played some role in the Kennedy assassination."" This leads them to an extraordinary conclusion -- again, it is only early August.In summary, every dollar spent by the RNC on Donald Trump's campaign is a dollar of donor money wasted on the losing effort of a candidate who has actively undermined the GOP at every turn. Rather than throwing good money after bad, the RNC should shift its strategy and its resources to convince voters not to give Hillary Clinton the ""blank check"" of a Democrat-controlled Congress to advance her big government agenda.Rick Wilson minces no wordsAll of that was pretty scathing, we've got to admit. Republican-on-Republican violence is never pretty to watch, to put it mildly. But when reading an article in Salon which detailed how many extreme rightwing strategists and media types have denounced Trump, the following really stood out. We close today with the thoughts of Rick Wilson, ""GOP strategist.""I have opposed Trump from the first day of his wretched, crapulous campaign. I have opposed Trump when his clownish minions called my clients seeking to have me fired. I have opposed The Donald when his slavish of Trumpbart stooges ran story after story attacking me, and unleashed their fever-swamp yokels on my email, my phone and my family.Chris Weigant blogs at:Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

That Erdogan would travel outside of Turkey, less than two weeks after an attempted coup, speaks reams about his hold on power. That his first overseas trip would be to Russia speaks equally clearly about the message he wants to send to Europe and the United States.Two days later, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, a close political ally of Erdogan, invited Russia to ""fight against the terrorist group together, so that we can clear it out as soon as possible."" Considering the difficulties that Washington had in getting Turkish support for its military campaign against the Islamic State or the fact that, to date, the overwhelming majority of Turkish military strikes in Syria were directed against Kurdish forces, a de facto Russian ally, and not those of Islamic State, the statement by Turkey's Foreign Minister was extraordinary.This is a remarkable turnaround from the breakdown in Turkish-Russian relations that occurred when a Turkish F-16 fighter shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 jet on November 24, 2015. As late as February 12, 2016, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was warning that an intervention in Syria by Turkish ground forces could precipitate ""a Third World War."" Six months later, the two countries are ostensibly discussing a joint operation.Is this the beginning of a fundamental realignment in Turkish foreign policy or is Ankara just flirting with Moscow? It's a little bit of both, but for now, more of the later than the former.At the end of World War II, Turkey found itself confronting a powerful Soviet state. Soviet military forces dominated the Black Sea and were encamped along its borders in the Caucasus and the Balkans. The Danube basin, its traditional commercial link to Europe, was dominated, as far as Vienna, by the Soviet organized, Warsaw Pact alliance. To the south, Syria and Iraq quickly evolved into Soviet client states, complete with Soviet military advisors and the latest armaments. Virtually surrounded by the Soviet Union and its clients, Turkey had little choice but to align itself with the West. NATO and American bilateral security guarantees solved its security dilemma, while access to Europe's commercial and labor markets provided an outlet for its industry and surplus labor.All that changed with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989. No longer threatened by Soviet military power, although still dependent on access to Europe's economy, Turkey no longer felt the need to march obediently in lockstep with Washington. Syrian refugee camp on the Turkish border, 50 miles north of Aleppo In the meantime, a deeper, more fundamental change was occurring in Turkish society. Turkey's traditional, Western-oriented, secularized, military and commercial elites were steadily losing political power to the more socially conservative, traditionally Islamic voters of rural Anatolia. Those voters were sufficient to bring Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power in 2002, and to keep them there to this day.Looking to the future, Turkey's geopolitical realities auger against a long-term orientation toward Russia. The Kremlin's desire to dominate the Black Sea is not in Turkey's strategic interest. Neither, for that matter, is the Kremlin's desire to expand, along with its Iranian ally, Russia's influence in the Middle East. More importantly, Turkey's own desire to expand its influence among the Turkic peoples that inhabit the central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan poses a significant challenge to the Kremlin's desire to maintain its influence in that region and, more importantly, to exert a degree of control over the regions hydrocarbon wealth and especially the pipelines that move it to markets in Europe.Turkey's historical competition with Iran for influence in the Middle East will also be difficult to reconcile with a pro-Russian alignment. As is the fact that, at least officially, Turkey seems determined to replace the Assad government in Damascus, an Iranian client. Of late, Ankara has been softening, somewhat, its opposition to the Assad regime, but it has stopped well short of indicating that it could live with its continuation. Erdogan has already accused the European Union (EU) and the United States of supporting the attempted coup. Turkish media has widely asserted that the CIA organized it, a view shared by a majority of Turkish citizens. Turkey has also demanded the extradition of former AKP supporter Fethullah Gulen, who it claims helped mastermind the coup, from the United States. Ankara's flirtation with Moscow is a not so subtle message to the EU and to the U.S. that Turkey has options outside of its traditional pro-Western alignment, and that the lack of support from its traditional allies, will cause Turkey to look for friends elsewhere. Russian Sukhoi fighter-bomber on a mission over Syria For Russia, a Turkish rapprochement at a time when Ankara is estranged from many of its NATO allies allows Moscow to sow dissension within the military alliance at a time when many of its members are uncertain of the organization's long term purpose or continuing role. Moreover, Erdogan has been very clear with the EU that Turkish support for controlling the flood of refugees into Europe is tied to Turkish access to the common market and especially unhindered access for Turkish citizens to Europe's labor market. The prospect of large scale Turkish migration into the EU has become a very contentious issue, one which the Euro-Skeptic parties have been quick to seize on. It may also have been a factor in the surprising victory of Brexit supporters. Russia has been equally clear that its support for curbing the refugee flood into Europe is tied to the elimination, or at least, the reduction of the economic sanctions imposed on Russia following its seizure of the Crimea. Issues that create divisions with the EU ultimately work to the Kremlin's advantage as they make it harder to maintain a common front on the imposition of sanctions and make it more likely that one or more countries within the EU may unilaterally drop the sanctions altogether.The US does not need Turkey to conduct its war against the Islamic State, but access to the giant American air base at Incirlik is important both as a staging ground for coalition air operations and for supplying the various Syrian rebel groups. Moreover, Turkish support in securing the borders with Syria and controlling the flow of jihadists into the Islamic State as well as the smuggling out of oil and antiquities is also essential. Moscow has very cleverly played the situation in Syria and now Turkey as well to gather up diplomatic chips that it can bargain with to achieve its primary objectives in Europe: the elimination of the sanctions and stopping the eastward expansion of NATO. By allowing the Kremlin a broader diplomatic space in which to operate, the White House risks seeing its policy options being boxed in. In an all too familiar pattern, the initiative is clearly in the hands of Moscow's offense while Washington continues to play a belated defense. In the short-term, Ankara's rapprochement with Moscow may be nothing more than an opportunistic political calculus, but Turkish society is changing, and the balance of power is steadily slipping away from the country's traditional, pro-Western, secular elite. The Erdogan years, rather than being an aberration in Turkey's traditional orientation, may yet prove to be the beginning of an entirely new direction in Turkey's foreign policy."

21,BUSINESS,Why It Should Matter That Hillary Clinton Was A Breadwinner,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-breadwinner_us_57adf1ece4b069e7e504e440,She may be the first U.S. president to truly understand working mothers.,2016-08-12,Bill and Hillary Clinton with baby Chelsea in 1980.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57adf240170000ae02c72d2f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Of course, Hillary Clinton is not like you and me, but for a short time beginning in 1980, she felt the primal anxiety most working mothers in the United States experience. Bill Clinton had essentially just been fired, having lost his reelection bid for governor of Arkansas. Chelsea Clinton was only 9 months old. They had to leave the governor’s mansion and find a home. Hillary was the one who had to pay for it. She needed work. Bill had other things on this mind, according to a fascinating report earlier this week from Amy Chozick at The New York Times. “She worried about saving for Chelsea’s college, caring for her aging parents, and even possibly supporting herself should the marriage or their political dreams dissolve,” Chozick writes.The financial stress of that time period, Chozick says, is a driving factor behind some of Hillary Clinton’s more questionable financial decisions in the ensuing years ― the controversial investments and board seats. Even the Goldman Sachs speeches.Perhaps even more profoundly though, the experience may have informed how Clinton thinks about policy. Any woman who’s had to work and raise a family knows that the U.S. leaves us hanging. Soon enough we may have a president who understands that better than any man who’s come before her. As first lady, in the ‘90s, when the culture was still largely hostile to working women and mothers, Clinton didn’t get a real opportunity to put that empathy into action. Indeed, in offering support for her husband’s welfare reform law she may have done real damage to poor working women. Now she’s pushing for a raft of policies that, in theory, would help poor and middle-class working women a great deal ― including equal pay, a higher minimum wage, paid family leave and subsidized child care. She’d be following President Obama, who has done a great deal for working parents, as The Huffington Post’s Mollie Reilly points out. That’s partially because we’ve finally arrived at a time when dual-earner parenting is increasingly common ― and not controversial. Obama also has the insights of his wife, who raised two young girls while working as a lawyer.Back in the ‘80s, Hillary Clinton was in pretty rarefied company. Only a small percentage of women were head of household 36 years ago. The Trumpian way ruled the day for most middle-class white women ― the Republican presidential nominee has said many times that he makes the money, and his wife, whoever that’s been, is the one who does everything else.Today the Clintons’ situation is pretty common: Women were the primary or sole breadwinner in 40 percent of all households with children under 18 in the U.S., according to Pew data from 2013. A record high number.  How do you work full time and raise a child or children in a country that offers almost no support to families outside of 10 months of public school each year?We’re the only country in the developed world that does not mandate some kind of paid maternity leave. If your workplace doesn’t offer it, you just suck up the lost income during one of the most financially precarious times of your life. Or you go back to work too soon and leave your infant with...Well, your options for child care are not great. It’s expensive, of varying quality and sometimes difficult to even secure. Once you get the kid or kids into public school, you still scramble. The school day ends hours before the work day concludes, after all. And in a country that doesn’t require employers to offer paid sick leave, you’re also at the mercy of not only your health but that of your children. For many women, each sick day costs money.And even if you nail all those pieces, you’re still just hustling to run a household and a career. Clinton, like millions of mothers today, had to figure some shit out. “Hillary had a couple years of the taste of what it means to be a working mother, without any help, to have to take care of a small baby and care for your job,” James B. Blair, a close Clinton friend and lawyer, told the Times.Of course, what happened next for the Democratic presidential nominee is utterly alien to most of us. The Clintons had Ivy League degrees, deep powerful connections and unimaginable privilege. Hillary landed a six-figure job, convinced a former friend/colleague to help with child care and managed to buy a home. With help from Blair she turned a small investment in cattle futures into a sum large enough for a down payment. (That trade would come up for much criticism later.) Bill did land work at a law firm, but he was making half as much as his wife and was traveling a lot of the time, according to the NY Times. Soon enough, he was back at it as governor and blah blah blah, you know the rest. As president, Bill Clinton didn’t seem to get the issues facing working mothers at all. His infamous Welfare reform forced millions back to work ― many of these people were mothers ― without providing any kind of support. The measure is considered a disaster in most progressive corners. Hillary Clinton supported the legislation at the time and touted it for years. That’s troubling.Let’s hope she figures something better out this time around.This story has been updated with additional details."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57adbafb1700002c00d1e5c0.jpeg?cache=hUo55I60y3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Historical precedent suggests that the current polling has predictive power. Donald Trump doesn’t seem to be ginning up GOP enthusiasm. And both candidates’ popularity bounces are starting to fade. This is HuffPollster for Friday, August 12, 2016.CANDIDATES LEADING AT THIS POINT USUALLY WIN THE ELECTION - Andrew Prokop: “We are two weeks out from the final day of the Democratic convention. And according to historical research by political scientists Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien, this is usually the time that the convention fog finally lifts and the polls become more predictive. ‘Although the convention season is the time for multiple bounces in the polls, one party ends up with an advantage when the dust clears. And this gain is a net convention bump rather than a bounce,’ Erikson and Wlezien write in their book The Timeline of Presidential Elections. That is, once the volatility dies down, one candidate usually emerges from the convention chaos with a durable lead. And almost always, the political scientists find, that candidate goes on to win the election….Indeed, the authors looked at general election contests going back to 1952, and found that the candidate who was in the lead two weeks after the conventions ended went on to win the popular vote every single time….[C]onventions tend to have a consistent and profoundly important impact of the type that’s hardly ever observed at any other brief phase of the campaign, even those much-hyped fall debates.” [Vox] A SHIFT TO ‘LIKELY VOTER’ MODELS ISN’T HELPING DONALD TRUMP - Steven Shepard: “Another traditional Republican advantage may be going by the wayside this year: Donald Trump, falling perilously behind Hillary Clinton in the polls, isn’t getting the standard ‘likely voter’ bump that usually boosts GOP candidates in the closing weeks of the election….Trump — viewed unfavorably by nearly two-thirds of voters — isn’t motivating enough Republican or Republican-leaning voters the way previous GOP nominees have. Polls show Clinton supporters and Democratic voters are as enthusiastic about participating in the general election as Trump backers and Republicans — if not more so. That’s a big turnaround from four years ago, when despite President Barack Obama’s overall advantage among the electorate, Republicans and voters who said they supported former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney were the more enthusiastic and motivated group….Marist College pollster Lee Miringoff credits Clinton’s performance among more-certain voters to a growing education gap: Even among white voters, Clinton has more support among the college-educated, while Trump runs better with voters who didn’t attend college. And more-educated voters, historically, vote at higher rates than less-educated voters.” [Politico] AMERICANS SHARE TRUMP’S PESSIMISM ABOUT THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY - Aaron Blake: “Bloomberg in its new survey attempted to approximate Trump’s view of the state of affairs in the United States, and it did the same for Clinton. Here’s the Trump description (which didn’t name him but is apparent): ‘The U.S. is in a dark and dangerous place, with threats from overseas and within our borders.’ And here’s the Clinton description: ‘The U.S. is in a strong position for progress on the economy and national security.’ Given those two options, 56 percent of likely 2016 voters picked the Trump version, and 40 percent picked the Clinton version….Despite this, of course, Trump continues to struggle mightily in the polls. That’s in large part because he’s an extraordinarily flawed messenger.” [WashPost]TRUMP AND CLINTON’S FAVORABLE RATINGS RETURN TO PRE-CONVENTION LEVELS - Frank Newport: “Americans’ views of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are almost exactly the same now as they were in early July before their party’s convention. Trump’s favorable rating became slightly more positive in the Republican convention environment, rising to 37% and matching Clinton’s for the first and only time in Gallup’s tracking. Then, as the Democratic convention was wrapping up, Clinton’s favorable rating rose to 42%, and the gap between the two candidates’ ratings expanded to 10 percentage points. These shifts in the public’s views of the two candidates were short-lived, however, and their images have now returned to where they were. Clinton is once again enjoying a modestly more positive image than Trump. Any hopes that either campaign had of using the conventions to create a major, lasting shift in Americans’ images of the candidates did not materialize.” [Gallup] TRUMP SUPPORTERS’ EFFORTS TO IGNORE THE POLLS ARE GETTING INCREASINGLY CREATIVE - HuffPollster: “Donald Trump, at the moment, is unambiguously losing in the polls. HuffPost Pollster’s model has him running nearly 8 points behind Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Of the most recent 20 surveys of the race, not a single one shows him ahead. Trailing in the polls often prompts candidates to spout truisms about Election Day being ‘the only poll that matters.’ Trump’s Republican opponents certainly tried that tack during the GOP primaries, despite the fact that Trump had a commanding, unbroken lead throughout nearly all of the process. But the depth of Trump’s polling deficit seems to have driven some of his surrogates and backers to increasingly more imaginative lengths….Polls, of course, don’t always get it right. Individual surveys can be outliers or flukes, the polling industry is struggling through some dramatic changes, and there are plenty of systemic misses more recent than 1948 ― take this year’s Iowa Republican primary and Michigan Democratic primary, not to mention a number of international miscalls….But there’s no reason to believe that practically every national survey is getting the current state of the race dramatically wrong.” [HuffPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

She told U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch that “we do not believe that local law enforcement authorities will provide a fair and impartial review.”Castile, an elementary school cafeteria worker, was gunned down by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez in his car in St. Paul, Minnesota after being pulled over for a broken taillight.Castile informed Yanez that he had a gun in his car, which he had a permit to carry. Castile announced that he was reaching for his license when Yanez fired his gun three to five times, according to Castile’s girlfriend Lavish Reynolds. Reynolds recorded the aftermath in a gruesome Facebook Live stream. Hatchett said that Castile, who had previously been cited by police at least 31 times while driving, was profiled and that evidence confirms his car’s tail lights were in tact.“Officer Yanez’s excessive use of force and fatal shooting of Mr. Castile was unjustified and warrants criminal prosecution,” Hatchett wrote.The investigation is currently under Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. A federal investigation would examine whether Yanez violated Castile’s civil rights was intentionally or not.Last month during a press conference, Hatchett promised that she would pursue justice on the victim’s behalf. “This time, we have a man complying with a police officer’s directions,” she said. “This time, we’re telling you, ladies and gentleman, must be the last time.” "

The final featured image from the session depicts women breastfeeding their babies (including one tandem nursing her twins), as well as mothers bottle-feeding formula and pumped breast milk to their children. Fox, who has a 6-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter, said her own breastfeeding struggles inspired her to create this empowering photo. She told The Huffington Post that when her son Maverick was born, he was an impatient eater with a voracious appetite, but he would not latch. “I couldn’t produce fast enough for him,” she said.After consulting specialists, Fox saw no improvements, and the stressed-out mom found herself crying herself to sleep each night. Ultimately, with her husband’s full support, she decided the best thing for her family was to switch to formula. Fox faced criticism for her decision. “I had many people tell me things like, I didn’t try hard enough, or I must’ve been doing something wrong,” she recalled. “Or the worst was when people would tell me my child wouldn’t be as healthy as breastfed babies.”“I actually had so much mom guilt that when people would ask me if I was nursing I’d lie, and they would always respond ‘good, breastfed is best,’” she continued. “The worst part about all of this, was it was other moms telling me these things. The people whom I thought I could go to and ask questions and get advice, they were criticizing my choices.”When Fox gave birth to her daughter Georgia, the baby latched instantly and nursed for three months, until the mom’s supply was suddenly depleted. “We tried supplements of all kinds, and nothing worked,” she said. “Being a second time mom I was much less worried about what other people said because I had kept a little boy alive and healthy for two and a half years, so I knew that I knew what was best for my kids.”“I was very happy that I was able to bond with my daughter through nursing but was OK with the fact that formula was what we needed to do for her,” Fox added. The photographer was always hesitant to share her struggles with others, but when World Breastfeeding Week came around this year, she decided to channel her emotions into a creative project. She had always wanted to do a nursing session. “But I also thought us bottle fed mamas are always left out,” she said. “Isn’t how we feed our children beautiful too?”While Fox said she understands the importance of normalizing breastfeeding in today’s society, she also thinks parents need to be less judgmental of their peers’ choices when it comes to nourishing their babies. “My thought behind this session was to remind the world that fed is best,” she said.To bring the project to life, the photographer posted on her Facebook page that she was seeking moms to participate in a photo shoot with their babies. She gathered the interested volunteers in a private Facebook group and shared the details of her vision. Expecting only 10-15 moms to remain interested, Fox was pleasantly surprised that ultimately 38 women still wanted to participate.

When the photographer posted the final image on her Facebook page, she was touched by all the positive comments and messages of gratitude she received from fellow moms.

The EPA’s draft report, which was released in June 2015, found “specific instances” of groundwater contamination from fracked oil and natural gas wells or wastewater disposal sites, but the agency concluded that there are no “widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources.”Of course, everyone who has an opinion on fracking thought that report said what they wanted it to say: Fracking opponents pointed to the documented instances of contamination, while its boosters said that the lack of systemic effects shows the technology is generally safe.But the EPA’s Science Advisory Board, an independent body that exists to review the agency’s research programs and provide the administrator with advice, said in a letter to Administrator Gina McCarthy Thursday that it has concerns about the “clarity and adequacy of support” for several of the report’s major findings.The SAB is concerned that these major findings as presented within the Executive Summary are ambiguous and appear inconsistent with the observations, data, and levels of uncertainty presented and discussed in the body of the draft Assessment Report. Of particular concern in this regard is the high level conclusion statement on page ES-6 that “We did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States.” The SAB finds that the EPA did not support quantitatively its conclusion about lack of evidence for widespread, systemic impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, and did not clearly describe the system(s) of interest (e.g., groundwater, surface water), the scale of impacts (i.e., local or regional), nor the definitions of “systemic” and “widespread.” The letter notes that the public could interpret that particular line in many different ways, and in fact already has. It suggests that the EPA revise how the findings are described in the report’s executive summary, and more clearly link them to the actual evidence provided in the full report. The board also wants the agency to better describe the limitations on the data collection and uncertainties in the findings. And it recommends that the agency more clearly lay out the places where it did find evidence of local impacts on groundwater and any conclusions that can be reached about them.Of course, environmental groups say the advisory board’s report reaffirms what they’ve been saying all along ― “The EPA’s own analysis shows that dirty oil and gas fracking contaminates drinking water, confirming what millions of Americans already know,” as Lena Moffitt, director of the Sierra Club’s Dirty Fuels initiative, said in a statement. And energy groups say it’s no big deal ― the scientific advisory board agrees with them that it’s safe. "

The party’s Senate majority was always going to be tenuous this year, according to McConnell, with 24 Republican-held seats up for grabs, compared to just 10 Democratic-held seats.Losing the Senate would severely limit Republicans’ power “to impact judicial appointments,” McConnell cautioned. It was a clear warning that the Senate must remain a priority regardless of the outcome of the presidential race.McConnell did not explicitly blame the GOP presidential nominee for harming the party’s Senate candidates, but he did criticize Trump’s campaign tactics and said he hopes he “settles down and follows the script.”It’s clear neither Trump nor Hillary Clinton is “widely appealing to the American people,” he added. Trump is tanking in the polls after a miserable few weeks that have been riddled with offensive remarks and other blunders, including a chaotic Republican National Convention in July.The latest Trump-related controversy came this week, when the candidate insisted President Barack Obama was a “founder” of ISIS. On Friday, Trump claimed the statement had been sarcastic.Earlier in the week, the real estate mogul drew widespread condemnation for saying “Second Amendment people” could stop Clinton from appointing judges, a remark may interpreted as a veiled threat of violence.Many Republicans in contentious congressional races are openly distancing themselves from Trump. McConnell has criticized Trump’s most outrageous comments but ― like other top Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) ― continues to endorse him. However, The New York Times reported in February that McConnell had a contingency plan in place should Trump win the nomination ― and become a liability for Republicans down the ballot. In such a scenario, McConnell argued, the GOP could limit its losses by keeping the candidate at arm’s length.“We will drop him like a hot rock,” McConnell reportedly told Senate colleagues at the time.Of course, Republicans losing control of the Senate may be even more dire for the party partly because of a decision McConnell made earlier this year: He refused to consider Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.Garland is widely considered a centrist. If Clinton wins the general election and Republicans lose the Senate, the next nominee may be far more liberal."

Massive, globular forms of divine goddesses and strange beasts tower overhead, made from ceramic tiles, mirror and glass. Sprawling women with glittering blue hair and heart-shaped nipples gossip with a tree with coiling serpents for branches. There are 22 works in artist Niki de Saint Phalle’s ambitious sculpture garden, each representing a Major Arcana card in the tarot deck. Out of the 78 total cards in the Tarot, the Major cards represent the formative experiences of life ― those that rip the individual out of their banal, daily existence and thrust them into incidents of transformation, growth, and understanding.There’s the Empress, the embodiment of fertility and sensuality, who wears the universe as her jewelry. There’s the Hermit, who symbolizes one who escapes the social world to gain inner knowledge and wisdom. And there’s Death, the symbol for transformation, leaving an old self behind. The artist underwent a major transformation herself before embarking on the Tarot Garden. She was born to an aristocratic family in Paris, who relocated to the Upper East Side when she was a toddler. At 11, Saint Phalle was molested by her father. At 17, she was recruited to become a fashion model. At 18, she was married. Soon after, she was in a mental asylum, wanting a fresh start. Saint Phalle embarked on the Tarot project in the late 1970s, 20 years after her stay in a psychiatric hospital. Her husband committed her after she’d attacked his mistress and swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. Art healed her, and Saint Phalle wanted to spread the gift of creative healing to others. Determined to change the course of her life, Saint Phalle left her husband and children to make a career for herself as an artist.

Massive, globular forms of divine goddesses and strange beasts tower overhead, made from ceramic tiles, mirror and glass. Sprawling women with glittering blue hair and heart-shaped nipples gossip with a tree with coiling serpents for branches. There are 22 works in artist Niki de Saint Phalle’s ambitious sculpture garden, each representing a Major Arcana card in the tarot deck. Out of the 78 total cards in the Tarot, the Major cards represent the formative experiences of life ― those that rip the individual out of their banal, daily existence and thrust them into incidents of transformation, growth, and understanding.There’s the Empress, the embodiment of fertility and sensuality, who wears the universe as her jewelry. There’s the Hermit, who symbolizes one who escapes the social world to gain inner knowledge and wisdom. And there’s Death, the symbol for transformation, leaving an old self behind. The artist underwent a major transformation herself before embarking on the Tarot Garden. She was born to an aristocratic family in Paris, who relocated to the Upper East Side when she was a toddler. At 11, Saint Phalle was molested by her father. At 17, she was recruited to become a fashion model. At 18, she was married. Soon after, she was in a mental asylum, wanting a fresh start. Saint Phalle embarked on the Tarot project in the late 1970s, 20 years after her stay in a psychiatric hospital. Her husband committed her after she’d attacked his mistress and swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. Art healed her, and Saint Phalle wanted to spread the gift of creative healing to others. Determined to change the course of her life, Saint Phalle left her husband and children to make a career for herself as an artist. A member of an aristocratic family with her fair share of wealthy friends, Saint Phalle dreamed big.

31,POLITICS,Conservative Legal Scholars Prefer A Liberal Supreme Court To A President Trump,Michelle Fields,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-legal-scholars-prefer-a-liberal-supreme-court-to-a-president-trump_us_57ade55fe4b069e7e504d4d3,"“The court is important, to be sure -- but not nearly that important.""",2016-08-12,Conservative legal luminaries distancing themselves from Donald Trump could potentially undermine one of the few remaining threads tying him to the GOP establishment.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57adeaf6170000d002d1e65f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some Republicans have argued that conservatives skeptical of Donald Trump should vote for him anyway, if only to prevent Hillary Clinton from nominating liberals to the Supreme Court. But the right’s leading legal scholars reject that idea: the risks of a President Trump would outweigh his influence on the high court.“The only glimmer of hope in the Trump fiasco” is the list of 11 judges the candidate put forward as suitable Supreme Court nominees, said Richard Epstein, a Hoover Institution Fellow and professor at both New York University School of Law and the University of Chicago Law School. But that is based “on the questionable assumption that a man of his mercurial temperament and intellectual ignorance will keep to his word,” he said.Even if a President Trump did honor that promise, “influence on the courts take time, and foreign affairs and domestic crises come up immediately,” Epstein said. And that’s not a risk the highly respected conservative legal scholar thinks is worth taking. “He is wholly unfit to deal with either of these two areas. In all other matters he is deficient,” Epstein added.In May, Trump’s campaign released the list of judges he would consider nominating to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. It was an attempt to appease conservative critics (though he later said he reserved the right to nominate someone not on the list). The list included six federal appeals court judges that then-President George W. Bush appointed and five state supreme court judges Republican governors selected. Conservatives in the media and in Congress roundly praised Trump’s list. Yet many right-leaning legal scholars tell The Huffington Post that, as important as the Supreme Court may be, it does not override all other issues when considering his candidacy. “The Supreme Court—and judicial appointments more broadly—is probably the single best reason to vote for Trump,” said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute. “But even then, there’s a lot of uncertainty. How hard would Trump push to get a nominee confirmed? What would he do if his first choice were rejected? Would he make a ‘fabulous deal’ to trade judicial appointments for other priorities?”“Trump put out a genuinely excellent list of potential appointees, but how much can we trust that list?” Shapiro continued. “Even Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, who were committed to appointing principled originalists and textualists, made mistakes; how would a president who knows nothing about the Constitution and thinks that judges ‘sign bills’ fare?”These conservative legal luminaries distancing themselves from Trump has the potential to undermine one of the few remaining threads tying the candidate to the Republican establishment. For some senators, it may give an additional push to allow consideration of President Barack Obama’s nominee to the court, Merrick Garland, based on the belief that he would be better than any potential Clinton pick.Trump, however, remains confident that skeptical Republicans will inevitably vote for him out of concern for the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court.“Even if people don’t like me, they have to vote for me. They have no choice,” Trump said in July. “Even if you can’t stand Donald Trump, even if you think I’m the worst, you’re going to vote for me. You know why? Justices of the Supreme Court.”Some conservatives, like radio host Hugh Hewitt, agree with Trump. Hewitt, who himself teaches constitutional law, argued in July that voting for Trump is a no-brainer because, “It’s the Supreme Court, stupid.” He suggested that if conservatives have “any doubts at all,” they should “take a course in con law.” “If Hillary wins, the casebook you use to do so will simply be a history book, not a guide to how the Supreme Court should decide things based on precedent,” he wrote in his column for The Washington Examiner.Prominent theology professor Wayne Grudem, of the Phoenix Seminary in Arizona, made a similar point. He wrote that a Clinton presidency would lead to an America that would, “no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree.”But many of the country’s top right-leaning legal scholars ― the people who understand the importance of the Supreme Court more than anyone ― just don’t find that argument compelling. “The court is important, to be sure ― but not nearly that important,” said retired Temple University Law School Professor David Post, who now writes for the conservative website the Volokh Conspiracy. “With all due respect to my colleagues who might feel differently, this one strikes me as a no-brainer.” The next president might end up only filling a single seat on the court, Post said. “The idea that it makes sense to trade a single justice for all of Trump’s terrible baggage ― his bullying, his ignorance, his appalling tendency to shoot his mouth off without thinking, and all the rest of it ― strikes me as thoroughly preposterous,” he added.Ilya Somin, who teaches law at George Mason University and also blogs for the Volokh Conspiracy, argues that a Trump presidency might even be worse for the courts than a Clinton one.“Trump has a terrible record on constitutional issues,” he said. “He seeks to gut freedom of speech and constitutional property rights, and undermine constitutional constraints on executive power even more than Bush and Obama have.”“Moreover, over the long term, a Trump victory increases the likelihood that the GOP will become a big-government xenophobic party hostile to civil liberties and opposed to most constitutional constraints on government power ― much like the far-right nationalist parties of Western Europe, whose platforms are very similar to his,” he continued. “Such a party is likely to do far more to undermine the Constitution than even a Hillary Clinton victory.”Epstein believes that most of his fellow legal scholars aren’t buying the argument that conservatives must support Trump for fear of Clinton’s potential Supreme Court nominees.“I am beginning to think that my views are now mainstream among serious defenders of any version of the conservative or classical liberal traditions,” Epstein said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
32,ARTS & CULTURE,These Are The Scars Of People Who Have Narrowly Escaped Death,Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emily-goddard-photos-of-scars_us_57ac7d2ee4b0ba7ed23f34fd,"Emily Goddard's ""When Death Leaves His Mark"" celebrates body diversity and shatters stigma.",2016-08-12,"Gezz, left template retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, 7th January, 2016",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ae0de31700002c00d1e70e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Photographer Emily Goddard has always been interested in the raw beauty of scars. It started when she was a child, innocently captivated by a large spherical growth on her godmother’s late husband’s cheek. “I remember it being quite shocking,” she explained.As kids, we’re not always prepared to deal with the aspects of life we don’t yet understand. As adults, though, we’re expected to ask questions, to dive deeper into subjects we’ve overlooked or misconstrued. That’s what Goddard has done with “When Death Leaves His Mark,” a gripping photography series that captures the faces and bodies of people who’ve narrowly escaped death ― and who live with the scars to prove it.One of Goddard’s subjects, a private in a parachute regiment named Jamie, suffered severe injuries during an aircraft fire in 2007. He had been flying solo, tragically without a parachute, and knew his only chance of making it out of the plane meant slowly lowering himself down through the flaming craft and jumping out when he was 15 feet above ground ― at a speed of 30 knots. Jamie subsequently suffered burns to 63 percent of his body. Doctors estimated he had a five percent chance of survival, but after six months in a drug-induced coma and 55 operations, he was running marathons, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, and cycling across the U.S. He did all of this with scars across numerous parts of his body, including his head and face.In conversations with Goddard, Jamie opened up about feeling suicidal following his accident, a feeling Goddard says would not be apparent to anyone meeting him now. “All the people in this series have escaped death narrowly and while this is amazing, they did not escape totally unscathed,” Goddard told The Huffington Post. “They are all just incredibly brave and strong people.” Talking with and photographing such survivors, Goddard hopes to highlight the fact that near-death experiences come with dramatic scars that are both emotional and physical ― something her childhood self, perhaps, did not fully understand.She also wanted to dismantle the idea that imperfections are taboo. “I think it’s critical that we continue to confront the stigma surrounding so called physical flaws,” she added, “and question the widely accepted yet unachievable concepts of beauty until they become too absurd to accept as plausible.”Goddard found all of her subjects through word of mouth. She started with friends who quickly spread the word, eventually connecting with strangers who were interested in being part of a series tackling the stigma of scars. While some of her images focus on intimate portions of the body, from an unclothed back to an exposed navel, she says the individuals she worked with were “unbelievably open” to showing her their scars.“I think and hope that these people are really proud of these scars on their bodies as they are one of the most genuine marks of bravery and strength of body and spirit,” she explained. “I think they, too, like me, see their scars as nature’s artwork and are something that should never bring shame or embarrassment.”As for her viewers, Goddard wants those who come into contact with her series to think more deeply about other people’s experiences and how those experiences have shaped who they are today. “I want people to look beyond image and explore the souls of others to learn who they truly are,” she concluded. “Never take anything at face value, there is usually more there.”You can see more of Goddard’s work here.

What is he trying to hide?”Clinton’s campaign also released a web ad on Friday urging Trump to release his tax returns:Trump has repeatedly said he can’t release his tax returns because he is under “continuous” audit by the IRS. (There is no reason why a person being audited can’t release their tax returns to the public.)In May, Trump’s then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said there is “nothing to learn” from the returns.“There’s nothing to see from 2002, 2003, and 2004,” Lewandowski said. “What you guys are interested right now, is what his tax rate is. His tax rate is as low as possible, as many deductions as possible, to build his business so that he could provide jobs in his corporation.”While there is no law requiring candidates to release their tax returns, the public has had access to the returns of every major party presidential candidate since Richard Nixon ran for re-election in 1972, according to Fortune."

Clinton touted her proposals to invest $275 billion in infrastructure, expand Social Security benefits, and enable debt-free college.And in explaining why many of those “common-sense solutions” had not been passed already, Clinton described a rigged system in terms familiar to followers of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ― or for that matter, Trump.“Powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress,” Clinton said.Felicia Wong, president of the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, and Stan Greenberg, co-founder of the Democratic polling firm Democracy Corps, applauded Clinton’s remarks.“With this economic speech, Secretary Clinton has made this election a choice about whether our economy works for all, not just the few, and that allows progressive economics to win a mandate in November,” the progressive heavyweights wrote in a joint statement.Democracy Corps published research on behalf of the Roosevelt Institute during the Democratic National Convention showing that key constituencies were more responsive to a message that characterizes the economy and government as fundamentally broken, rather than just promising to build on existing progress.The two organizations’ work is part of a broader effort by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party to ensure that their agenda takes precedence ― both on the campaign trail and in a Clinton White House.  Clinton’s most significant remarks, however, were on international trade, an issue on which Trump has relentlessly attacked her as an unreliable guardian of American workers’ interests. It is also an especially salient topic in manufacturing-heavy Michigan, where Clinton lost a primary fight to Sanders, in no small part due to voter opposition to trade agreements.Clinton, who once praised the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, offered her firmest promise yet that she would not allow the accord to pass.“I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” Clinton said, drawing cheers. “I oppose it now. I’ll oppose it after the election. And I’ll oppose it as president.”The Obama administration argues that the 12-nation Pacific Rim trade accord will open doors to economic growth and raise human-rights standards.But labor unions, environmental groups, and many Democratic lawmakers claim it will result in massive manufacturing job losses, greater ecological destruction and higher drug prices.Anti-TPP activists said they fear Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress will make a deal with congressional Republican leaders to pass the accord during the lame-duck session of Congress after the election.Democracy for America, a digital progressive activism outfit that endorsed Sanders in the primary, launched a petition campaign with CREDO Action on Wednesday asking Clinton to urge the White House and Democratic congressional leaders not to pass the TPP. CREDO Action also bought digital ad space promoting a video ad with a similar message.Charles Chamberlain, Democracy for America’s executive director, praised Clinton’s remarks on Thursday, but also used them as an opportunity to ratchet up the pressure.“It’s now more important than ever that the country and President Obama hear specifically from Secretary Clinton that a vote on the job-killing TPP during a lame duck session of Congress must not happen,” Chamberlain said in a statement."

I want to be an inspiration, but I would like there to be a day when it is not ‘Simone the black swimmer.’”She said that she’s optimistic about how her win can impact these issues and help to diversify swimming. “It means a lot, especially, with what’s going on in the world today, some of the issues with police brutality,” Manuel said. “I think this win will kind of help bring hope and change to some of the issues going on in the world.” Manuel’s win has proved to be emotional for so many. Black people on social media highlighted how significant her feat was by referencing the racist history of segregation that has denied black people access to pools. And, of course, Twitter celebrated all of the black girl magic within Manuel that made her historic victory possible. Take a look at some Twitter users’ best reactions."

But by the end of the third event, the beam rotation, Biles held a commanding lead of more than 1.5 points. She sealed it with an impressive floor routine.Biles’ celebratory comments come on the heels of several high-profile sexist headlines to emerge in Brazil. An NBC commentator this week compared one of the three-time world champion’s uneven bars routines to that of a man’s.Other women’s accomplishments have been linked to their husbands and coaches, or celebrated because of their age or recent pregnancies.While Biles has already made Olympic history, there are still a lot of medals to be won. The gymnast is still favored to take home a few more golds in three individual events later this week. Viewers can expect to see absurd levels of difficulty and routines packed with skill-after-skill many of her peers won’t even attempt in competition.As her teammate Raisman said, “Simone’s just in her own league.

In a recent interview on NPR’s “Morning Edition,” Hill discussed the culture of sexual harassment in the U.S. and what kind of impact the allegations against Ailes could potentially have.“I think it makes clear that even though the men are more powerful, even women who are perceived to have some power have trouble coming forward,” Hill said, referring to TV commentator Gretchen Carlson who was the first woman to accuse Ailes of harassment.One factor that often makes it hard for women to come forward with their stories is a lack of protocol within companies to deal with issues such as these, Hill said. She told NPR: I also think that it makes people aware that how, in these situations where there is extreme hierarchy and you have an individual who is well-regarded on many levels, that it is very difficult for women to come forward because in many ways they don’t have anyone to report to who can actually do anything about it, who can change the behavior of this powerful person. I’m talking about companies where you do have this fairly iconic figure, and companies are prohibited from stepping outside the chain of command, even talk to people who are above them in rank.And what’s one thing Hill would do to change this culture of extreme hierarchy? Take back that $40 million Roger Ailes received from Fox News after he was let go from the company. “One thing I would have the Fox News network do is to take back the $40 million [severance package] that Roger Ailes reportedly has received,” she told NPR. “It seems to me that that sends a very bad signal, and in fact if the allegations are proven to be true, then certainly not only has he violated the law but I would also say that he has actually injured the company in a way that would keep him from being entitled to a severance pay.”Hill said it’s important to acknowledge the different obstacles women face when reporting their assailant. “We also need to look at how different women are evaluated [when they report harassment],” she said. “It may be women are evaluated differently because of their race or religion, status in the workplace. There are a whole lot of things that go into the mix.”Fortunately, women are still stepping up and telling their stories. “One thing that I am very sure of is if we look at 1991 and think about what happened, even though from the outside observer it seemed that in fact I’d lost, I was treated very badly, women continued to come forward and they came forward in record numbers,” Hill said. “And that I believe is a good sign.” Listen to the full NPR interview below.

42,BLACK VOICES,Simone Manuel's Olympic Win Is Huge Considering Swimming's Racist Past,Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/simone-manuels-olympic-win-is-huge-considering-swimmings-racist-past_us_57add79ae4b071840410de1d,Black people weren't always welcomed in pools.,2016-08-12,"Protesters demonstrating in the swimming pool of the Monson Motor Lodge in Saint Augustine, Florida, scream as motel manager James Brock dumps ""muriatic acid"" into the water.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ade3ac170000ae02c72cec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are levels to Simone Manuel’s epic Olympic win on Thursday. The 20-year-old has become the first black woman to win a gold medal in an individual swimming competition in the history of the Olympics. Tying for the gold medal with Canadian swimmer Penny Oleksiak, Manuel also set an Olympic record with a time of 52.70. What the Texas native has managed to accomplish during her time in Rio is most definitely historic ― but it’s also weighted with meaning that extends far beyond the Olympics.There is an infamous photo from 1964, of a motel manager named James Brock pouring acid into the swimming pool of his Saint Augustine, Florida, motel. Below him, black and white protestors attempting to integrate the segregated pool scream in shock and fear. The photo is a visceral reminder of the everyday realities of segregation in the United States. Black people weren’t even allowed the dignity of cooling off in a pool or at the beach without being segregated and denied access.According to The Guardian, during the 1920s and ‘30s thousands of luxurious public pools were opened all over America. All of them were segregated. When desegregation began in the ‘50s and ‘60s, government officials withdrew funding for desegregated pools. White pool-goers ultimately fled for the perceived comfort and “safety” of private, segregated pools and the rundown public pools left over for black people were gradually closed down. Today, there’s a stereotype that many people, including some black people, subscribe to: “Black people can’t swim.” Of course, that isn’t completely true. Many black people, throughout the diaspora, know how to swim. But what is true is that white people in America are two times more likely to know how to swim than black people. What is true is that black children are three times more likely to die in the water than white children. What is true is that many black people over the course of America’s history have been unable to learn to swim because they have had to contend with a lack of access to safe places to swim, the stigma of swimming being a so-called “white” sport, and generations of older black people passing on their fear of the water to younger generations. Is it any wonder, then, that in the professional sports world, so few black people (and especially black women) have made it to the Olympic level in swimming? After all, it was only 12 years ago, in 2004, that Martiza Correia McClendon became the first black woman on the U.S. swim team. “I’m proud to be the first, but I don’t want to be the last,” McClendon said at the time. What’s a little jarring about Manuel’s historic victory in Rio is the fact that some media outlets have seemed to downplay or ignore its overall significance. As many black Twitter users pointed out on Wednesday, Manuel’s first place position in the 100-meter freestyle semifinal was completely passed over by NBC, with very little acknowledgement (there was an obligatory tweet). The media was criticized for making light of Manuel’s win, focusing more on her opponents and Australian swimmer Cate Campbell. The athletic accomplishments of young black women like Simone Manuel, like Lia Neal and Ashleigh Johnson (the first black woman to compete in water polo at the Olympics) are vital, their presence in Olympic swimming competitions even more so. They serve as a palpable and important reminder of how far black people have come in the United States after something as simple and necessary as being able to swim was denied to us. Today, we’re not just swimming ― we’re slaying the game. "

Swimmers with ties to the state had won a total of 13 medals at the Olympics ― including 10 golds ― as of Friday morning, according to the Baltimore Sun. If multiple members of a winning relay team were from Maryland, the Sun counted that as multiple medals. Michael Phelps has accounted for four of the golds. Katie Ledecky has won three gold medals, plus a silver. Allison Schmitt, Cierra Runge, Jack Conger and Chase Kalisz also helped with the medal count.For a state that ranked 19th in population last year, Maryland’s total is pretty impressive.A certain Maryland bigwig seems to agree:H/T Time "
44,POLITICS,Donald Trump Drives Another Mormon From The GOP,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-mormon-republicans_us_57adfc14e4b069e7e504f281,Jim Bennett is the son of a former senator who apologized to Muslims about Trump's comments.,2016-08-12,Donald Trump is not doing so well with prominent Mormon Republicans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57adffc71700002c00d1e6ca.jpeg?cache=fURyzLoOWj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yet another Republican has left the party because of Donald Trump.Jim Bennett, the son of former Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah), said Friday that he recently switched his voter registration to independent because the GOP has changed for the worse under its presidential nominee.“The Republican Party that was near and dear to my heart for most of my adult life bears very little or no resemblance to the party of Trump,” Jim Bennett told MSNBC’s Kate Snow. “You know, people had called me a RINO, a Republican in name only, and I decided that I no longer wanted to be a Republican even in name as long as Donald Trump is heading the ticket.”Bennett, who is Mormon, was in the news earlier this year when he revealed that his father had spent time before his death apologizing to Muslims for Trump’s comments.Jim Bennett’s new comments speak to Trump’s struggle in winning over Mormon voters, a group that consistently votes Republican but has been hesitant to support Trump and includes some of his most prominent critics.Trump acknowledged Thursday that he has “a tremendous problem” winning over Utah voters. During remarks to a room full of evangelical Christian pastors, he called the state “a different place” before asking, somewhat awkwardly, “Is anybody here from Utah?” Nobody responded. “I didn’t think so,” he chuckled.Trump is currently ahead of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Utah, according to HuffPost Pollster averages of available surveys. She hasn’t given up on the state, however ― her husband, former President Bill Clinton, appeared at a fundraiser there on Thursday. Trump has clear vulnerabilities in Utah. He did poorly in its Republican caucuses ― Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) received about 69 percent of the vote, compared to Trump’s 14 percent. There’s speculation that newly announced candidate Evan McMullin, a Trump critic who is Mormon, could hurt the GOP nominee in the state by pulling votes from him. Mormons make up more than 60 percent of the state’s population, and prominent members of the religious have been highly critical of Trump. For example, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, is one of the leaders of the “Never Trump” effort. He has said he plans to write in his wife’s name rather than voting for either major party candidate. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who is also Mormon, did not rule out voting for Trump but blasted the candidate in June for attacking Cruz and for making religiously intolerant statements.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released a statement in December, after Trump said he wanted to block Muslims from entering the country, that did not refer to the candidate by name but reaffirmed the church’s commitment to religious freedom. “I think one of the reasons Donald Trump is having so much trouble in Utah is that Mormons culturally identify with a history of persecution, with a history of feeling like religious outsiders,” Bennett said Friday. “And seeing Trump label Muslims as outsiders I think is really reprehensible to people of my faith.”Bennett said he thinks Trump will still win Utah because “tribal loyalties to the Republican Party are very strong.” But he still thinks Clinton has a shot, which he called “astonishing.” He said he currently doesn’t plan to vote for Clinton, but that his sisters have urged him to. “This is not Clinton country,” he said. “So the fact ― a Democrat hasn’t won a statewide race in Utah for about 25 years. So the fact that any Democrat is competitive here is remarkable. but the fact that it’s Hillary Clinton demonstrates just how odious most Mormon voters find Donald Trump.”Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. "

If he was called to lead, then how would he react to the subjugation that he felt daily ― not only towards himself, but to others that looked like him around him. That was a fascinating story. It checked all the boxes.”After teaching himself to read, Turner went on to become a preacher, claiming he was chosen by God to deliver Bible scripture to other slaves throughout the state of Virginia. Turner’s teachings eventually resulted in a slave rebellion (also known as the Southampton Insurrection) which left approximately 60 slave owners dead.Parker, who grew up in a Christian church, went on to add that he hopes the film helps fellow Christian viewers “at a crossroads” by posing the question of “where is the line” drawn when it comes to justifying religion and oppression.“I feel like we see that a lot in 2016 ― more often now than I ever could’ve imagined. I ask myself: ‘If Christ was here, how would he react to the misuse and misrepresentation of his name and his actions,’” he said.“’How might we be more effective in holding ourselves as Christians accountable to his actual word?’ I, for one, believe that partisanship should have nothing to do with the actions of Christ. You’re either Christlike, or you’re not.”Parker also aims to set his film, which has been seven years in the making, apart from D.W. Griffith’s 1915 movie “The Birth of a Nation,” by making it resonate with the social issues that are prevalent today.“I honestly think this is a film that could start a conversation that can promote healing and systemic change in our country,” he said in a 2015 promotional video clip for the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. “There’s so many things that are happening right now in 2015 — 100 years after the original ‘Birth of a Nation’ film, here we are.”“Birth of a Nation” is scheduled to hit theaters Oct. 7.
