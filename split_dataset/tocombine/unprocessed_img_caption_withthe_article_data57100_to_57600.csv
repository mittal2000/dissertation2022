2,POLITICS,How The Fight Over North Carolina’s Bathroom Law Could End Up Hurting Domestic Violence Victims,Dana Liebelson and Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-bathroom-law-funding-domestic-violence_us_5733959fe4b0365741118c91,"By defending the law, the state is jeopardizing services that are crucial to vulnerable populations, including transgender people.",2016-05-12,The millions of dollars that North Carolina receives for vital programs is at stake as its governor defends his bathroom bill.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57339659160000ae0731e7e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- By suing the federal government to protect his state's law policing transgender individuals' bathroom choices, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) isn't just risking big business, his state's reputation and his political future. He's also risking millions of dollars in federal funds that pay for state programs aimed at addressing domestic violence and sexual assault -- programs that are particularly crucial to transgender individuals, who face high rates of violence.The Justice Department warned McCrory last week that the bathroom bill -- which bars transgender people from using public restrooms that don't correspond with the sex on their birth certificates -- violates multiple federal laws, including the Violence Against Women Act. That law, which was reauthorized in 2013, provides federal money for programs that combat sexual assault and domestic violence. VAWA explicitly bans fund recipients from discriminating on the basis of ""actual or perceived"" gender identity or sexual orientation.McCrory sued the Justice Department, arguing that the law does not discriminate against transgender people, and does not violate VAWA and other laws. The Justice Department disagreed, and countersued.Supporters of HB2 have argued the law protects women and children who use public facilities from male intruders. But by defending the law, the state is jeopardizing services that are crucial to vulnerable populations, including transgender people. Half of transgender individuals are sexually abused or assaulted at some point in their lives, according to 2005 reports cited by the Justice Department. ""The fact that the DOJ would even consider threatening federal funds for such services over a new and misguided interpretation of federal law is ludicrous,"" said Ricky Diaz, a spokesman for McCrory's re-election campaign. ""It also goes to show you that DOJ's action isn't about protecting people, it's about imposing its political agenda on the rest of America.""Diaz added, ""The governor took the responsible approach by suing the federal government to ensure that North Carolina continues to receive federal funding until the courts clarify the law.""In 2015, state and local entities in North Carolina received about $5 million in grants under VAWA, according to data analyzed by researchers at the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, a think tank dedicated to research on sexual orientation and gender identity law.That number includes over $420,000 that went to sexual assault services program funding at the North Carolina Department of Public Safety and almost $300,000 to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for reducing sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking on campus, said Christy Mallory, one of the authors of the report. ""Our DOJ funds could be in jeopardy,"" said Dana Mangum, executive director of the North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence, a nonprofit. She added that cutting funding would ""significantly reduce"" their ability to do domestic violence training.Aside from the law putting resources for sex abuse victims at risk, advocates for rape and domestic violence survivors oppose HB 2. More than 250 of such groups signed a statement last month saying that ""falsehoods"" about sex abuse perpetuated by conservative lawmakers were causing the needs of rape survivors to be ""obscured in order to push a political agenda that does nothing to serve and protect victims and potential victims.""By going up against the feds, McCrory is also risking up to $4.7 billion annually in federal education funding, according to the Williams Institute report. The process to remove these funds is not simple. The lawsuit alone could take years if the case is appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. And Debora Osgood, who spent 25 years with the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, noted the OCR never attempted to pull funds during her time there. If any part of the federal government actually moved forward on trying to strip the state of education funding, it would go through a “cumbersome process,” she said. There is much more money at stake from the Education Department than the Justice Department. However, experts believe it's unlikely that the Education Department funding will be stripped, since this action would essentially kill the state's public colleges because no student could get federal financial aid. Federal funding at the K-12 level also covers the salaries of about 7,700 employees, or 7.4 percent of all K-12 personnel in the Tar Heel State.Pulling all federal funding for schools is ""such a thermonuclear option,"" said Barmak Nassirian, a federal lobbyist for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. ""One would have to assume that things would be resolved way in advance of reaching that point."""
3,POLITICS,FBI Director Continues Blaming 'Viral Videos' For Murder Spike In Some Cities,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-director-ferguson-effect_us_57337226e4b05cf702257d9d,But James Comey admits he doesn't know for sure what is behind violent crime increases.,2016-05-12,"""It's hard for me to believe that there isn't something broad that's affecting"" the violent crime increase in some cities, FBI Director James Comey said Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5734b929130000f0043816b6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- FBI Director James Comey once again suggested this week that the ""viral video effect"" on police may be to blame for the rise in murders in some cities, tripling down on a theory that has put him in conflict with the Obama administration as well as criminal justice experts who don't see any evidence of a connection between murder spikes and scrutiny of police.Citing conversations with law enforcement leaders, Comey contended that ""marginal pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers,"" as well as ""changes in the way police may be acting and in the way communities may be acting in terms of how much information they share with police,"" could be having an effect on homicide spikes. The comments came at a press briefing with reporters at FBI headquarters on Wednesday, which took place shortly after Comey had been briefed on early homicide numbers in a number of cities in early 2016.But as pointed out by experts at the Brennan Center in March, there's simply no evidence of a national crime wave, let alone a signifiant spike in murders that could somehow be attributable to scrutiny of the conduct of police officers. While there was a 1.7 percent spike in the violent crime rate, there was a significant 4.2 percent drop in property crime in the first half of 2015.""While there were 471 more murders in large cities in 2015 than 2014, more than half (260) of that increase occurred in just three cities: Baltimore, Washington and Chicago. Until we have more information, then, warnings of a 'new nationwide crime wave' are premature by several years and more than a few percentage points,"" wrote Ames Grawert and James Cullen.At the briefing with reporters, Comey said he didn't know for sure what was driving a spike in homicides in some cities.""It could be it's simply a collection of individual factors in different cities,"" Comey said in response to a question from The Huffington Post. ""It's hard for me to believe that there isn't something broad that's affecting it, but maybe it could be. Maybe the reason that we're seeing a jump in homicide in different cities all over the county is driven by factors in those particular areas.""Many members of law enforcement leaders are also insulted by the suggestion that officers are standing down on the job simply because they fear being filmed with a cell phone camera. “He ought to stick to what he knows,” James O. Pasco Jr. of the National Fraternal Order of Police told The New York Times. ""He’s basically saying that police officers are afraid to do their jobs with absolutely no proof.”Comey said the preliminary 2016 numbers he's seen showed a ""significant number of cities have seen a significant jump in their homicide rate between this quarter and last year,"" when numbers were up over 2014. He acknowledged the threat of oversimplifying the cause of spikes in violent crime rates, which can be affected by a large number of factors (including, for instance, easier access to guns in certain parts of the country).""These are really hard questions. Academics wrestle with it and wrestle with it,"" Comey said. ""I think everybody ought to wrestle with it, because something is going on.""The Huffington Post asked Comey what the public policy solution would be to the ""viral video effect"" -- if it truly does have an effect on homicide numbers -- given that private citizens have the constitutional right to record police officers operating in public.""There's nothing wrong with scrutiny, Comey said. ""If that is a part of what's going on in some of these cities ... it's incumbent upon leaders in the police organizations and in the communities to agree we all want the same kind of policing.""Comey said that ""everybody"" wants the same kind of ""up-close, respectful, appropriate policing"" in their communities.""We want police officers to get out of their car at midnight or 2 a.m. and say 'Hey, you guys live around here?' and have a conversation with them, up close,"" Comey said. ""And so if there's something going on in the community where there's fewer and fewer of those conversations, leadership in the police needs to make sure that's what's expected, and leadership in the communities to say that's exactly what we want. We want you out of your cars talking to these people in an appropriate and respectful way.""Comey contended that what he has said has sometimes been mischaracterized.""I'm not against scrutiny of police, I think that's fabulous and has worked some important changes in the past two years, and I hope it continues to,"" the bureau's chief official said. ""What I'm worried about is, we all agree we want the same kind of policing and if it's not happening, we've got to talk about why."" Comey also said that it may take more than two years for the federal government to get an accurate count of how many people were killed by police officers each year, and said that was frustrating. "

5,GREEN,Obama Administration Cracking Down On Potent Planet-Warming Gas,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-methane-rules_us_5734b250e4b077d4d6f24df3,The new rules are yet another line of the administration's attack on climate change.,2016-05-12,Fracking has allowed the U.S. to release more natural gas in recent years but has led to increased methane emissions.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5734b344160000b60731e92c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency announced on Thursday final rules that will crack down on methane emissions from the booming natural gas industry.Methane is a greenhouse gas that has much greater planet-warming potential in the short term than carbon dioxide. It is also a primary component of natural gas, and its release during the oil and gas extraction and transportation process has emerged as a major concern as the U.S. has vastly increased its gas production. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking -- a process that uses a high-pressure blast of water, sand and chemicals to tap into gas contained in shale rock -- has allowed the U.S. to unlock a lot more gas in recent years.For new and modified oil and gas extraction sites, the EPA has set new standards for reducing emissions that the agency says will capture 510,000 short tons of methane in 2025 -- the equivalent of 11 million metric tons of CO2. The standards aim to prevent leaks from operations and facilities. The rules also crack down on the release of volatile organic compounds and other toxic air emissions.The EPA released a draft of these rules in August. The agency said it received more than 900,000 comments on that proposal.""Every leak fixed,"" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said in a call with reporters Thursday, means ""less pollution affecting the health of communities and the stability of the climate.""The EPA also said Thursday that it will begin to collect information on leaks from existing wells and infrastructure, with plans to regulate those sources as well. The EPA's data collection is supposed to begin in the fall, however, which means the Obama administration is not going to issue any rules for those sources before leaving office.The Obama administration has set a goal of reducing methane emissions from oil and gas up to 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025.Environmental groups largely praised the final rules, while arguing that regulations for existing infrastructure are crucial to meeting the overall reduction goals. ""Today’s action to limit emissions from newly created sources of this pollution is an important start. It cannot stop there,"" Antonia Herzog, deputy director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. ""The vast majority of the problem lies in the oil and gas infrastructure that already exists across the country. EPA must follow through on the President’s commitment to address these sources next, and soon.""But the oil and gas industry is pushing back on the new rules, calling them ""unreasonable"" in a statement from the American Petroleum Institute. ""It doesn’t make sense that the administration would add unreasonable and overly burdensome regulations when the industry is already leading the way in reducing emissions,"" API Vice President of Regulatory and Economic Policy Kyle Isakower said in a statement. ""Imposing a one-size-fits-all scheme on the industry could actually stifle innovation and discourage investments in new technologies that could serve to further reduce emissions.""The Republican leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee also balked, saying in a statement that the rules ""will add significant burdens and costs to an already highly regulated industry."""
6,POLITICS,Don't Let Donald Trump Explain Away His Muslim Ban As Merely A 'Suggestion',Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-muslim-ban-suggestion_us_57349898e4b08f96c18253f1,The presumptive GOP nominee is attempting to recast himself ahead of the general election.,2016-05-12,The presumptive GOP presidential nominee is attempting to sand off his hardest edges ahead of the November election.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5734d56b13000001053816fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As he shifts gears ahead of the general election, presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has been busy softening his stance on a number of issues -- including self-funding his campaign, taxing the wealthy, raising the federal minimum wage and cutting entitlement spending like Social Security and Medicare.But perhaps the biggest -- and most brazen -- attempt to make himself more palatable to the GOP establishment and general election voters alike is his recent comment spinning his controversial call to ban all Muslims from entering the United States as ""just a suggestion.""""We have a serious problem, and it's a temporary ban -- it hasn't been called for yet, nobody's done it, this is just a suggestion until we find out what's going on,"" Trump told Fox News Radio's Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday.That's decidedly not the way Trump and his campaign presented it earlier this year. Take, for example, a statement his campaign released in December in the aftermath of the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.""Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,"" the statement read.Trump has said the ban -- no matter how unworkable and misguided -- would be temporarily in place until ""we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat"" of Islamic terrorism. In other words: indefinitely.It is a serious policy proposal from the presumptive nominee of a major political party and ought to be treated as such. The ban is as much a suggestion as any of his other proposals, including his plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and his call to repeal Obamacare. The whole point of running for president is to suggest change in national policy (except perhaps Hillary Clinton, who is arguably running on a continuation of President Barack Obama's legacy).As further evidence of his seriousness, Trump said Wednesday that he may even tap former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to lead a commission tasked with studying his immigration plans such as barring Muslims and deporting undocumented immigrants.Moreover, Trump appears to have actually normalized his proposed ban among GOP primary voters. According to exit polls conducted by The Associated Press and Edison Research following March primary elections in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Missouri and Illinois, about two-thirds of GOP primary voters said they supported the ban -- a remarkable feat in just a few short months. The immense public support from Republican voters is further proof that campaign rhetoric isn't merely that; it has real-world consequences. It is especially important to hold Trump accountable with such attempts to obfuscate and move to the center as he courts establishment figures like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who on Thursday did not endorse the real estate mogul, but appeared to move closer to a candidate described by some in his party as a ""con man” and a ""pathological liar.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

""A Muslim mosque cannot be subjected to a different land-use approval process than a Christian church simply because local protesters oppose the mosque,"" the brief states. The Islamic Society of Basking Ridge, led by the town's former mayor, Mohammad Ali Chaudry, first presented the proposal for the mosque in early 2012. The group plans to build a nondescript mosque on a four-acre plot that Chaudry purchased in November 2011 in an area of town where zoning permits houses of worship. After four years of negotiations and 39 public hearings, the planning board officially denied the request in December. In March, the Islamic Society filed a lawsuit, accusing the planning board of breaking a law that protects houses of worship from being inordinately burdened by land use regulations.The society, backed by nearly 20 civil rights and religious groups, accuses the board of religious discrimination. The township's attorney denied the claim to local news media. Chaudry, a Pakistani immigrant who has lived with his family in Basking Ridge for nearly 40 years, said he was ""overwhelmed"" by the organizations' support.“I came to America almost 50 years ago with a firm belief in the values that America represents, including freedom of religion and equality before the law,” Chaudry said in a statement.Gurjot Kaur, senior staff attorney for Sikh Coalition, echoed Chaudry's sentiments.""Freedom of religion is the cornerstone of what we all value as Americans,"" Kaur told The Huffington Post. ""That freedom is being denied in New Jersey due to bigotry, fear and intolerance. The Sikh Coalition is proud to stand in solidarity with our Muslim neighbors in condemning that behavior in every form.""The Becket Fund’s amicus brief was joined by the National Association of Evangelicals, Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, American Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Sikh Coalition, and the International Center for Krishna Consciousness, among others."
8,POLITICS,Elizabeth Warren And Congressional Democrats Call Out Lack Of Diversity At The Federal Reserve,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-democrats-federal-reserve-diversity-letter_us_5734a6a9e4b08f96c1825db1,"Top central bank officials are disproportionately white, male and from the finance or business sectors.",2016-05-12,Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) led a group of Senate and House colleagues in calling for greater diversity at the Federal Reserve.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5734a763130000f004381685.jpeg?cache=VoMYy6oBeA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A majority of House Democrats and eleven Democratic senators sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday, urging the Fed to improve the diversity of its top officials and increase the representation of consumer and labor groups in its ranks.The letter, spearheaded by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the Senate and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) in the House, argues that a lack of diversity of all kinds at the Federal Reserve undermines the central bank's ability to represent the public. The Fed’s control over monetary policy, the letter notes, gives it far-reaching influence over the economy. When the central bank decides to raise interest rates, it increases borrowing costs, putting downward pressure on job creation in order to keep inflation in check.A Fed with fewer black and female decision-makers might be less attuned to the ways in which modest changes in the job market disproportionately affect African-Americans and women, both of whom suffer from employment discrimination. “When the voices of women, African-Americans, Latinos, and representatives of consumers and labor are excluded from key discussions, their interests are too often neglected,” the letter states.Boasting the signatures of 116 House Democrats, including all of the Democrats in the Congressional Black Caucus, the letter does not lack for evidence with which to critique the central bank. Eighty-three percent of the board members of the regional Federal Reserve banks are white, and almost three-quarters of them are men, according to a Center for Popular Democracy study cited in the letter.Just 11 percent of those board members represent consumer and community groups or labor organizations, the study states, while 39 percent come from the financial industry and 47 percent from other major business sectors.The congressional Democrats praised Yellen in the letter for prioritizing full employment since she has taken the helm in 2014. Yellen has presided over just one increase in the Fed’s benchmark rate in December, when the Fed raised it to a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent from the near-zero level, where it had been since the 2008 financial crisis.The letter also credits Yellen for promising to “consider” African-American candidates for open regional Fed president positions during her congressional testimony in February, and expressing ""concern"" that there has never been a black president of a regional Federal Reserve bank.But just days after Yellen’s testimony, the Democrats note, the Fed announced it had approved the re-appointment of 10 regional Fed presidents, all of whom are white and eight of whom are men.“Despite the importance of this decision, there appears to have been no public consultation, and limited transparency regarding the metrics and criteria used to evaluate the presidents’ performance, or in the decision to reappoint them,” the letter alleges.Warren and Conyers’ letter is part of a broader push by progressive members of Congress, along with national activist groups and like-minded economists, to make Federal Reserve monetary policy a key component of the progressive agenda. They argue that the outsize influence of inflation-wary financial professionals on the central bank, plus sustained pressure from ideological conservatives in Congress, mean it's time for liberals to be more vocal about their views.The Fed Up coalition, an alliance of progressive groups headed by the Center for Popular Democracy, has led these efforts, which include a reform plan released in April that would transform the Fed into a wholly public entity, among other changes. (The 12 regional Fed banks are currently owned by private financial institutions.)Fed Up said activists affiliated with its member groups made calls to members of Congress to encourage them to sign the letter.Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was among the lawmakers who did so. Sanders also praised Fed Up’s April reform plan and released detailed proposals of his own for the central bank in December.Fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign implied that Clinton agreed with the letter's key demands.“Secretary Clinton believes that the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole as well as that commonsense reforms -- like getting bankers off the boards of regional Federal Reserve banks -- are long overdue,” Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said in a statement. “Secretary Clinton will also defend the Fed's so-called dual mandate -- the legal requirement that it focus on full employment as well as inflation -- and will appoint Fed governors who share this commitment and who will carry out unwavering oversight of the financial industry.""The remarks appear to be the most explicit comments to date by either Clinton or her campaign on the Democratic presidential front-runner’s vision for the Fed and the types of Fed officials she would appoint as president.Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump’s presidential campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.Trump told CNBC last week that he would likely replace Yellen, who is the first female chair of the central bank, once her term ends in 2018. In the same interview, he said he supports low interest rates, a policy Yellen promoted that might be undone by a more conservative Fed chair.Trump's latest comments suggest a departure from claims he made in August, when he said the low rates were feeding a financial asset bubble.Read the full letter here."

The restaurant chain announced that food prices would rise in those locations to cover higher labor costs, and in turn, the average employee's $2-an-hour plus tip wage would rise to $12 an hour.The problem is, nobody believed them.Bob Merritt, the shack's new chief executive, told investors last week that both customers and employees weren't happy with the policy, according to The New York Times. Company research found that diners hated the price hikes, and 60 percent disliked the new tipping policy -- they were happy to throw a little extra cash toward their wait staff as an incentive for a better experience.""The system has to change at some point, but our customers and staff spoke very loudly,"" Merritt told the Times. ""And a lot of them voted with their feet.""Those 18 locations lost 8 to 10 percent of their customers, and former CEO Raymond Blanchette told CNNMoney that some employees quit over the policy.Now Joe's Crab Shack is rolling back its plan, decreasing prices at 14 locations but keeping the no-tip measure at four locations as a continued experiment.“We are going to try to figure out why it worked in some places and why not in others,” Merritt told Nation's Restaurant News. “The way we look at it is: We are really continuing the tests in place with where it works.”Other, smaller ventures have also tried to implement similar policies and failed. According to Grub Street, Fedora in New York City announced Monday it will bring back gratuities due to customer complaints."

A new report from consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that drones could replace $127 billion worth of labor and services over the next several decades. It's easy to see that number and conclude that drones are going to come and kick you to the curb.But the truth is a little more complicated. For one, drones don't save companies money just by reducing their labor costs. Drones also make business services, like delivering packages, more efficient, according to the PwC report. That means drones can cut down on costs without necessarily ousting tons of workers. And while some industries stand to lose lots of jobs to automation, others probably won't be as severely affected. Much of the agricultural sector is already mechanized, for instance, and drones used to inventory crops might just replace satellites currently used for the same purpose.""As with any emerging technology, some types of jobs currently done by people will be less required in the future, especially those that are highly repetitive or dangerous,"" Michal Mazur, one of the study's authors, told The Huffington Post. ""But at the same time, we see a need for a growing number of new professions,"" including drone designers and data analysts, he said.That doesn't mean drones won't replace any jobs, however. Some tasks -- like collecting data about infrastructure or quickly delivering medical supplies -- can be done more efficiently using drones, the report notes. Drones can also make it easier to capture aerial footage for films, survey land and plan mining projects. Overall, there's little question that automation is going to dramatically change the way people work over the next few decades.Nearly half of the activities people get paid to do could be automated right now using existing technology, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It's not just low-wage jobs that could vanish. While jobs that pay less than $20 an hour are most at risk of disappearing, even highly paid jobs involve activities that could be automated, the report found. But the McKinsey report stresses that automating certain tasks isn’t the same as replacing entire occupations. “Very few occupations will be automated in their entirety in the near or medium term,” the report states. “Rather, certain activities are more likely to be automated.”And even when robots take old jobs, they often create new ones, according to J.P Gownder, an analyst at the tech research firm Forrester. For instance, robots require people to repair and maintain them, jobs that often take significant skill and training.“While these technologies are both real and important, and some jobs will disappear because of them, the future of jobs overall isn’t nearly as gloomy as many prognosticators believe,” Gownder wrote in a 2015 report. “In reality, automation will spur the growth of many new jobs—including some entirely new job categories.”Automation is definitely going to shake things up. But there's little use worrying until we know exactly how. "

We can't say we're surprised, given his tendency to ignore anything and everything published about him.While speaking to journalists at a luncheon during the Cannes Film Festival, the ""Café Society"" director was asked about the article, which discusses the sexual abuse accusations against him brought on by his estranged daughter, Dylan Farrow. Dylan came forward with her story for the first time publicly in a 2014 op-ed in The New York Times. ""I never read anything about me,"" Allen told the press. ""Any of these interviews I do, anything. I said everything I had to say about that whole issue in the New York Times, I don’t know if you read it, some time ago. I have moved so far past that. You know, I never think about it. I work, and that’s the end of it for me. I said I was never gonna comment on it again because I could just go on endlessly.""When a Variety reporter asked if the director has any plans to read the article, he responded redundantly, saying, ""I never read anything."" ""I never read what you say about me, or the reviews of my films. I made the decision 35 years ago to never read a review of my movies, never read an interview, never read anything. Because you could easily become obsessed with yourself,"" he added. ""I’ve been very productive over the years by not thinking about myself, and not obsessing over myself.""The reporter then pointed out that Ronan's THR piece isn't a criticism of his films, telling the director, ""It's your son,"" to which he responded, ""I’ve said all I have to say about it.""Ronan's editorial calls out actors like Miley Cyrus and Louis C.K. for continuing to work with the 80-year-old director despite the controversy and allegations surrounding him. In the piece, he outlines the double standard the media has when it comes to covering stories of sexual abuse, especially when men of power are involved. He wrote:When The New York Times ultimately ran my sister's story in 2014, it gave her 936 words online, embedded in an article with careful caveats. Nicholas Kristof, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and advocate for victims of sexual abuse, put it on his blog.Ronan also encouraged journalists to start asking tougher questions when interviewing Allen (and anyone else involved in stories of sexual abuse), and judging by the group of reporters at this luncheon, it seems the call to action was taken to heart. The ""Annie Hall"" director was also asked about Laurent Lafitte's joke about him at the Cannes opening ceremony. Lafitte, the master of ceremonies, quipped, ""It’s very nice that you’ve been shooting so many movies in Europe, even if you are not being convicted for rape in the U.S."" The joke seemingly stunned the crowd, but Allen was apparently unbothered by it. ""I’m completely in favor of comedians making any jokes they want,"" Allen said at the luncheon. ""I am a nonjudgmental, non-censorship person on jokes. I’m a comic myself, and I feel they should be free to make whatever jokes they want.""""I’m never offended,"" he added. ""It would take a lot to offend me.""Allen's ""Café Society"" star Blake Lively, on the other hand, was offended by the joke. The actress told Variety on Thursday, ""I think any jokes about rape, homophobia or Hitler is not a joke,"" adding ""it was a hard thing [to] swallow in 30 seconds."" And while Allen claims not to have read his son's THR column, it seems his PR team did. The Hollywood Reporter's Tatiana Siegel tweeted on Thursday that she was banned from the ""Café Society"" luncheon, noting, ""This is what @RonanFarrow meant by Woody Allen's PR machine."" We may not have all the answers, and we may not get them, but what journalists can do is continue to ask questions."

""Not worth commenting on such an idiotic report,"" Jenner’s rep said. ""Of course it's not true.""The rep's rebuttal came after Ian Halperin, who is the author of Kardashian Dynasty: The Controversial Rise of America's Royal Family, claimed in an interview with The Wrap that a family friend told him that Jenner found living her authentic life was ""much harder than she anticipated.""Halperin predicted that Jenner would ""de-transition"" in the next few years, and then open up publicly about the difficulties in transitioning. ""It hasn't been easy for Caitlyn, it's been very hard,"" the friend said, according to Halperin. ""She's thrilled she has raised awareness about how transgender people have long been discriminated against but I think there's a chance she’ll de-transition in the next couple years. I don't think it would surprise anybody in her inner circle.""The friend also told Halperin that Jenner was allegedly ""still into women,"" and was just waiting ""to meet the right one,"" according to The Wrap. That claim, however, conflicts with statements Jenner herself made on the March 6 episode of ""I Am Cait.""""To be honest with you, I can't see myself dating women in the future,"" she said on the reality show. ""I've been there, done that. I've got three very strong ex-wives. I just don't see it.""Instead, she said she'd be interested in dating a man with time-honored values. ""If I was in a relationship with a guy, I would enjoy being treated like that -- opening doors for you, doing all what you think is the traditional stuff in a guy and a girl relationship,"" she said.

That's where Lee and her colleagues plan to offer their amendments.Lee's amendment would repeal the 2001 AUMF -- the never-expired, 9/11-era war authorization that the Obama administration is using as legal justification for bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) will push an amendment that would cut off all funding for military operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria unless Congress passes a new AUMF.It's not just Democrats demanding action. Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) plans to offer an amendment that would attach a bipartisan AUMF bill to the NDAA. And Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) says he plans to send a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) urging him to allow a floor vote on a new AUMF. ""I want to remind Mr. Ryan that he is denying members of Congress their constitutional duty, that we are sworn to uphold the Constitution, and one of those duties is to vote whether we send our young men and women to die or not,"" Jones said.Most members of Congress would prefer to ignore the AUMF issue altogether. War votes are tough, and President Barack Obama has already made the case that he doesn't need congressional sign-off to go after ISIS. He maintains the 2001 AUMF gives him that authority because ISIS is an offshoot of al Qaeda, which was the target of that AUMF.

The pair gets into all manner of hijinks, before, naturally, professing their passionate feelings for one another. Each line and action scene flows smoothly into the next, in that stream of perfectly timed events that makes audiences exclaim about the magic of movies.Of course, movies aren’t magic, but the products of lots of money and grueling work. To capture the grittier side of the industry -- or at least the scenes we don’t always see -- a photo exhibition titled “The Art of Behind the Scenes” aims to reveal those offhandedly magical moments not captured on camera.In one photo, Hepburn and her co-star in “How to Steal a Million,” Peter O’Toole, sit uncomfortably crammed in a broom cupboard, his leg twisted around her demure lap, in preparation for shooting a heist scene. In another scene, on the set of “Moby Dick,” filmed in 1954, a crew of shirtless men helm a lifeboat while two cameramen maneuver around the choppy waters, trying to capture the perfect shot, a feat that wouldn’t have been weathered if CGI had been around at the time. In yet another, actress Brigitte Bardot sits on the floor with legs splayed, cigarette hanging from her lips, playing what looks to be a game of Solitaire, in a perfect image of on-set ennui.These and other images of how movies are made were collected by Finch & Partner and Jaeger-LeCoultre in “The Art of Behind the Scenes,"" which will be on view at the Hôtel du Cap in Antibes, France, on May 13, 2016, coinciding with the annual Cannes Film Festival.

A satellite that monitors the ice malfunctioned, forcing the center to suspend the service.Researchers missed a lot during those dark weeks.Using information from a different satellite, the NSIDC provisionally updated its Arctic sea ice data on May 6 -- and the findings were alarming. According to the data, the Arctic sea ice melt season is running as much as one month earlier than average. Unless weather patterns change dramatically, that could mean a record year for summer melting of Arctic ice.The ice already appears to be disappearing at a pace far faster than in 2012, when Arctic ice extent hit a record low. Mark Serreze, the director of the NSIDC, told Mashable that there is evidence of fractures in the ice cover north of Greenland, which is “quite unusual” for this time of year.“To me, it suggests a thinner, weaker ice cover,” he said.In 2013, the U.S. Navy predicted an ice-free Arctic this summer. Now some reports show this prediction may indeed be realized. This spring, the European Space Agency's CryoSat 2 satellite revealed that ice cover across the Arctic Ocean was, on average, 15 percent thinner than it was at the same time last year.In March, the NSIDC announced that Arctic sea ice had reached a record minimum for winter maximum extent. If Arctic sea ice levels plummet below 2012 levels this summer, it will be the second historic low of the year.""I've never seen such a warm, crazy winter in the Arctic,"" Serreze said in a statement earlier this year.

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), one of the most vulnerable senators up for re-election this year, appealed to GOP leaders Wednesday to confirm two of his judicial nominees by skipping over those of other senators who have been waiting longer.Nobody really liked that.Toomey, who's been getting clobbered by Democrats for his role in blocking a vote on President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, urged Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to hold votes for Pennsylvania federal district court nominees Marilyn Horan and Susan Baxter. They are two of 11 judicial nominees ready to be confirmed, but the Senate is barely moving because of McConnell, who is loath to allow votes on any more Obama nominees.""How about we try a step in the right direction? How about we vote on these two judges?"" Toomey said on the Senate floor. ""They are the two who would fill the seats vacant the longest.""The problem with his request is that eight other district court nominees are in line ahead of his, and traditionally, the Senate confirms them in the order that they arrive from the Judiciary Committee. That means Toomey was asking to make all of those nominees -- including those from GOP states like Tennessee and Nebraska, and those that would fill judicial emergencies -- wait longer because, well, he's running for re-election and could use some good press back home.""I think this would be progress if we could simply agree to have a vote on these two nominees,"" Toomey said. ""Let's get off this all-or-nothing situation.""Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said he supported Toomey's effort, but only if he agreed to allow votes for the other nominees, too. One of them, of course, was a Whitehouse nominee. But McConnell objected to Whitehouse's request, so Whitehouse objected to Toomey's request. In other words, nothing came of any of it.The timing of Toomey's stand seemed a bit orchestrated. He's under tremendous pressure to look bipartisan and to distance himself from the GOP blockade against Obama's Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland. He's in a dead heat with his Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty, and a Wednesday poll showed that 58 percent of Pennsylvania voters want the Senate to give Garland a vote.McConnell signaled later that, whenever he does decide to give a judicial nominee a vote, he'll do it in order -- even at the expense of a vulnerable member like Toomey. The GOP leader's office announced Wednesday evening that he's ready to hold a vote on a judicial nominee: Maryland's Paula Xinis, who is first in line."

Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah), who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources, had anticipated that the third draft of the bill would be ready Wednesday. But it became clear early in the day that that wasn't going to happen.""We are making progress, but we are not there yet,"" said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Bishop's ranking member on the committee. ""The situation in Puerto Rico is dire, but a bill that doesn't solve the problem, or doesn't pass, won't help anyone.""The delay comes on the heels of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's recent trip to Puerto Rico -- an attempt on his part to put a spotlight on the debt crisis and its effects on the 3.5 million Americans living there. A spokesman for Bishop downplayed the latest holdup, and wouldn't say when the committee plans to introduce the text.""We are in a good place,"" said committee spokesman Parish Braden. ""We’re working through some technical stuff and minor refinements that will take us through today.""Finding a happy medium -- one that wins over conservatives in the Republican ranks, while keeping Democrats signed on -- has proven tricky for negotiators working on the bill. After failing to muster the support needed for a committee vote in April, Bishop abruptly pulled the legislation and returned to the drawing board.A second attempted markup is scheduled for next week. To keep it on the calendar, a bill would need to be introduced by Friday, a Democratic aide said.Despite the struggle to find a way forward, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sounded optimistic Wednesday when asked about the most recent hiccup.""We were disappointed that the bill we saw yesterday wasn't something that we could support, and so another few days of back and forth, I think, will produce something that we can take to the floor,"" Pelosi said. ""It absolutely must happen.""Puerto Rico missed a debt payment of roughly $400 million on May 1, and barring congressional action, it is expected to default on a $2 billion payment scheduled for July 1.

(Reuters) - The man accused of killing three people and wounding nine others in a shooting rampage last year at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado was declared incompetent to stand trial at a court hearing on his mental state on Wednesday.The ruling by El Paso County Judge Gilbert Martinez effectively means a suspension in criminal proceedings against the defendant, Robert Lewis Dear, 58, stemming from the first fatal attack on a U.S. abortion provider since 2009.The bearded, disheveled Dear, visibly angered at the ruling, called the judge ""prejudiced"" and a ""filthy animal"" as he was led out of the courtroom at the end of the 30-minute hearing.Dear, who has proclaimed himself guilty and a ""warrior for the babies"" in previous courtroom outbursts, will be transported back to a state mental hospital in Pueblo, Colorado, for ""restorative treatment,"" and his status will be reviewed again in 90 days, on Aug. 11, the judge ordered.Martinez cited the findings of two court-appointed state psychologists who evaluated Dear and concluded he was suffering from a psychotic delusional disorder that they said rendered him mentally unfit to stand trial.The judge said he was convinced that while Dear could comprehend the proceedings from a factual standpoint, his delusions and paranoia left him unable to meaningfully assist in his own defense.Martinez ordered Dear to undergo a psychiatric evaluation in December after the South Carolina native demanded he be permitted to fire his attorney and represent himself. Dear has insisted he is mentally competent.A police detective who interviewed Dear after his arrest and testified at a competency hearing last month recounted Dear saying after his arrest that he harbored a belief that he was being followed by federal agents before the shooting.Separately, defense lawyer Dan King mentioned in court on Tuesday that his client had smeared himself with his own excrement and drank his own urine from a toilet because he believed the jail was poisoning his drinking water.Dear has been held without bond since surrendering at the end of a bloody five-hour siege on Nov. 27 at the Planned Parenthood center in Colorado Springs. A U.S. Army veteran and a mother of two who happened to be in the waiting area were killed, along with a police officer.Dear has not formally entered a plea. Prosecutors have yet to say whether they would seek the death penalty.(Reporting by Keith Coffman; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Stephen Coates and James Dalgleish)"
