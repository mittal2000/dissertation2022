0,POLITICS,Oklahoma Bill Seeks To Protect Schools That Offer Bible Courses,Alexandra Svokos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hobby-lobby-bible-class_n_6464834.html,,2015-01-14,"File - This April 18, 2014 file photo shows a textbook by the Museum of the Bible which will be used for a new elective course starting in Fall 2014 at the suburban Oklahoma City Mustang School District high school in Mustang, Okla. According to emails obtained by the Associated Press, Hobby Lobby chief Steve Green has had a much larger role than previously suggested in the design and implementation the curriculum. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e3f824000051005776c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A proposed bill in the Oklahoma state Senate seeks to allow schools to offer ""an elective course in the objective study of religion or the Bible"" without fear of legal liability.Senate Bill 48 was introduced by state Sen. Kyle Loveless (R-Oklahoma City) after Mustang Public Schools had difficulty offering an elective course on the Bible.Loveless says his bill would mean schools could not be sued for offering courses about religion or the Bible.""The district and others across Okahoma have shown interest in having such a class, as an elective, and I am just wanting to keep them from feeling threatened of lawsuit or from not offering a class such as this,"" Loveless said in an email to The Huffington Post.Last April, the district's school board approved course curriculum that had been provided by the Museum of the Bible. The museum was founded by Steve Green, the president of Hobby Lobby, an arts and crafts retail store based in Oklahoma. According to Religion News, in November 2014 Mustang decided against offering the course after questions were raised by the Freedom from Religion Foundation and Americans United For Separation of Church and State, who both worked with the American Civil Liberties Union to oppose the course. ""This sounds like a dodge,"" Burton Caine, law professor at Temple University, said when asked about Loveless' bill. ""Distinctions make the field of religion in schools very foggy, but this one is foggier than any.""Caine added that it ""makes no difference"" in terms of First Amendment law whether the course was an elective or core class.Loveless told a local paper, ""It is not a forced class and this would not be a 'Sunday School' type course. We are not endorsing one religion over the other."" Asked by the paper whether he would support the bill if the language included study of the Quran, Loveless said, ""Oklahoma is a predominantly Christian state. There has been no movement to teach the Quran as an elective. I would be open to debate on the issue.""HuffPost has reached out to the school district for comment.The Supreme Court permits religion to be taught in schools provided it is ""presented objectively as a part of a secular program of education."" Green's involvement in the Museum of the Bible curriculum raised concerns that the course would not meet these standards.When Mustang Public Schools first approved the course, a report from The Associated Press pointed out questionable portions of the curriculum, such as telling students that sinners would ""suffer the consequences.""Stephen Prothero, a religion professor at Boston University, reviewed the curriculum at the time in a USA Today article. While Prothero conceded that ""you cannot make sense of Western art or American literature without basic biblical literacy,"" he said he had two major objections: first, that the textbook interpreted Bible stories through a Christian lens, and second, that the textbook insisted on the truth of the Bible.Hobby Lobby hopes to bring this class to thousands of schools around the country, HuffPost reported last April.Last summer, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, holding that corporations can opt out of providing contraception coverage to employees based on religious objections."

Viewed through the lens of culture, some of the winning content and commentary on the night tapped into a couple of key cultural themes we predict will gain traction in 2015. The first is a growing desire for what we're calling frank reality. This is a backlash against the micro-managed, overly-curated, glossy online selves that have become the norm. Instead, there's a groundswell of people seeking realness with all its flaws, in all its awkwardness and imperfection -- a quest for greater authenticity and genuineness, if you will. Importantly, this celebration of the real and the true is not to be confused with an attempt to hide behind the mundane (think normcore); rather, we're talking here about being true to yourself to a degree that's raw, gritty -- and fascinatingly personal.At the Golden Globes, Transparent was hailed as just that -- an intensely open and honest account of Mort's transgender journey to Maura. Director Jill Soloway celebrated her own father -- ""you told your truth"" -- expressing the passionate hope that the show ""will teach the audience about truth, authenticity and love."" Jeffrey Tambor, who won for best actor in a TV comedy, commented that ""this is big -- bigger than me"" and dedicated the award to the transgender community.The quest for and celebration of frank reality was apparent elsewhere. On the red carpet, Lena Dunham responded to questions about the reason for Girls' success by commenting on the show's role in recalibrating expectations around gender roles and femininity. Winner Gina Rodriguez, who apparently turned down a more stereotypical role to wait for the lead in Jane the Virgin, gave an emotionally resonant speech urging Latinas to be true to themselves, and praising ""a culture that wants to see themselves as heroes,"" while Julianne Moore (who won for Still Alice) confirmed we no longer live in a time when ""no one wants to see a movie about a middle-aged woman."" Patricia Arquette's warts-and-all performance in Boyhood was also honored; her acceptance acknowledged today's step-change that permits interest in the story of ""an underappreciated single mother.""The second cultural shift is related to the first -- an increasing impetus for speaking up. This not only means standing up for what you think is right, but also taking a risk in being provocative; having a point of view, being bold. Outspoken celebrities are increasingly leading vocal support for certain causes (think Lady Gaga, Emma Watson) -- and seeds of this cultural theme were apparent on Sunday night.Hip-hop artist Common led the charge with his moving acceptance of the award for best song -- from Selma -- pointing to the ongoing struggle of ""those fighting for justice right now,"" and referencing the tragic death of Michael Brown. The presence of Margaret Cho dressed as a supposed military official from North Korea was a recurring reminder of vocal celebrity protest against forced censorship of The Interview. And there were a few -- but nonetheless notable -- references to the need to defend freedom of expression in the wake of the tragedies in Paris; from HFPA president Theo Kingma's assertion that Hollywood is ""united against anyone who would repress free speech,"" through Helen Mirren's conspicuously-worn pen, to Jared Leto and George Clooney's ""Je suis Charlie.""We expect these cultural themes to gain traction through this year and predict we'll continue to see further examples of frank reality and speaking up. It will be interesting to see whether they gather enough momentum to become actual cultural shifts -- representing a real evolution in our collective values, signaling a change in how we make choices and evaluate the world around us. If so, the Golden Globes might just have a dual function as a crystal ball. With contribution from Helen Firth, SVP, Added Value"

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), have teamed up to express concern that U.S. drug policy conflicts with United Nations conventions banning legalization of the drug.The senators, in letters last week to Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of State John Kerry first reported by Tom Angell at Marijuana.com, write that the Obama administration's loosening of federal law enforcement to allow states to legalize marijuana violates U.N. drug controls. They say they're also troubled by recent State Department statements calling for ""flexible interpretation"" of U.N. drug conventions.“These approaches threaten to weaken U.S. standing as an international leader on drug control issues and may undermine the international treaties the United States and other countries have signed,” Grassley said in a statement. “The Administration should account for remarks and policies that send a message of tolerance for illegal drugs,” Grassley said.Recreational marijuana -- legalized by voters in Colorado, Washington state, Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C. (although Congress has made efforts to block D.C.'s measure) -- remains illegal under federal law.States that have legalized marijuana or softened penalties for its possession have relied on Justice Department guidance urging U.S. prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations that meet certain federal priorities.The pot laws also conflict with U.N. drug conventions, which call on participating nations to confine the production, distribution, possession and use of marijuana to scientific and medical purposes. In their letter to Kerry, Feinstein and Grassley, who co-chair the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, urge the State Department to adhere to U.N. conventions on illicit substances because that ""flexible interpretation"" may allow states ""to implement policies that legalize other, even more harmful drugs, without recourse.""Angell, chairman of marijuana reform group Marijuana Majority, singled out Grassley for advocating that ""the will of U.S. voters take a back seat"" to U.N. treaties. ""I thought these guys were supposed to be all about standing up for American rule of law in the face of international aggressors,"" Angell said of congressional Republicans.Grassley is ""not arguing that U.N. treaties trump U.S. law,"" said spokeswoman Jill Gerber. ""U.N. treaties and U.S. law are separate entities,"" she said. Feinstein's office declined further comment.Grassley and Feinstein say in their letter to Holder that the Justice Department's hands-off approach to states that have legalized marijuana has put the U.S. in a ""difficult"" position with U.N. drug controls. The senators say they're concerned no one at the DOJ ""has initiated a centralized effort to measure the overall effect of these laws"" by monitoring compliance with the eight federal priorities the department set for states that have legalized the drug.The senators asked Holder to lay out a plan to compile data on the impact of states' marijuana legalization no later than Feb. 15. Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said the department is reviewing the letter. The State Department didn't respond to a request for comment."

Moves Forward With Marijuana Legalization Measure,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dc-council-transmits-mari_n_6465964.html,,2015-01-14,"A man holds up a sign for Ballot Initiative #71, the legalization of marijuana, on November 4, 2014 in Washington, DC.

Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) submitted the District of Columbia's new marijuana legalization initiative to Congress Tuesday, ignoring an effort by congressional Republicans to block the measure.Alana Intrieri, legislative counsel to Mendelson, confirmed to The Huffington Post in an email Tuesday that Initiative 71 has been transmitted to Congress, beginning a mandatory 30-day congressional review process.In November, 70 percent of D.C. voters approved the initiative, which would legalize up to two ounces of cannabis for personal use and up to six marijuana plants for home cultivation while still banning sales.Though the city is mostly autonomous, the U.S. Constitution gives Congress final say over the District's laws. If Congress and President Barack Obama do not decide to block the measure, the new law could go into effect as early as March.However, a $1.1 trillion federal spending bill that was signed by Obama in December was flooded with hundreds of additional provisions known as ""riders."" One of these, introduced by Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) was an anti-pot measure forbidding D.C. from using any funding to enact an initiative relaxing penalties for drugs that are illegal under federal law.Now, following Mendelson's move, there is disagreement over what will happen next to the pot referendum.A spokesman for Harris told HuffPost in December that the 30-day review period is irrelevant, because Harris' rider says the city cannot ""enact"" its marijuana law.But supporters of the law argue that the initiative has already been enacted. Mendelson has said that if Initiative 71 makes it through the congressional review process, the District would not be required to spend any money on legalization, which would make Harris' rider irrelevant.“The District’s examination agrees with our analysis that the initiative was enacted when voters approved it and will take effect at the end of the 30-day congressional review period,"" the District's nonvoting representative in the House, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) said to HuffPost on Tuesday.Multiple congressional Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) agree with Mendelson and Norton's interpretation and say the law should be allowed to move forward.Congress has the length of the review period to overturn Initiative 71. However, if Congress does not interfere with the measure, it automatically becomes law.If the law ends up getting blocked by Congress, it wouldn't be the first time the legislative branch has interfered with local marijuana laws in the District of Columbia. In 1998, 69 percent of D.C. voters approved a medical marijuana ballot measure, but the implementation of the law was blocked by Congress for more than a decade.Dr. Malik Burnett, policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance and vice chairman of the D.C. Cannabis Campaign, said that Congress now has the opportunity to stand by the will of D.C.'s voters who chose to end what he calls ""the racially biased enforcement of marijuana laws.""""Let’s see if those members of Congress who are opposed to marijuana policy reform are willing to stand by the courage of their convictions and be forever recorded as being on the wrong side of history,"" Burnett said."

A race to the finish line. That's been Mircosoft's recent experience, at least. The company, once produced a Windows 386 commercial GeekBeat.TV host, John Pozadzides, criticized as having ""bad acting, bad rapping, and bad 80's hair."" But a new approach to content marketing proves it's come a long way in its video marketing. Microsoft's Dynamics product is a line of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management software applications. Not exactly the type of content you'd search for on YouTube. But the product line's creative marketing team has been able to get viewers to do just that. Microsoft's recent ""Flavor and Fuel"" campaign was designed to inspire and engage with business professionals who really don't expect Microsoft to do more than provide the latest business technology. Done by sharing captivating stories from a behind-the-scenes perspective. ""We wanted to create content that people would really care about that would, if they so desired, lead them to Microsoft and discover how Microsoft could help their business,"" explains Senior Microsoft Marketing Manager and Storyteller, Matthew Woodget. ""And if they didn't care, the content would be so good, they'd want to forward it on to someone who did."" The MS Dynamics team developed their recent content modeling to be customer-relevant, and human-relevant, without being overtly product or fan-driven. Creating content that has value in and of itself beyond the marketing is important as marketers are no longer only fighting for a prospect's attention, versus the competition. The battle is on all fronts. As humans our attention is pulled in many directions; friends on social, professional ideas on LinkedIn, personal past times on forums, Hulu and even our families seem to want us to ""pay attention"" to them. If people do not value your content they will quickly move onto something else, taking that investment of time elsewhere. If a customer is already deep into a relationship with you then they can and will extract value from information that is specific and detailed about your products or services. When you are growth hacking, looking to increase your subscribers or customer base then you don't yet have that relationship. And that is when you need to weave your content and objectives into content that has inherent value. The concept of the attention economy isn't new. In fact, my industry friend, former Microsoft manager, and now Vice-president of Marketing at Sprinklr, Jeremy Epstein wrote about it in 2008, asking, ""How do we effectively cut through all the noise to establish authentic dialogue and relationships and... make money?"" Seven years later, addressing it and respecting it within the craft of marketing, is still very much evolving. Every time there is a breakthrough content delivery approach or channel (think Pinterest, Snapchat) marketers need to explore how that can affect their ability to growth hack in their target markets.Because the video content is about real people and about interesting businesses, it reaches and resonates to more than just enterprise project managers and the like. Universal themes around people, processes, and technology pair nicely with stories about real people, and it works. (Documentary short film trailer for Flavor and Fuel: A Story of Modern Craftsmanship)And their accompanying full features: Lotus F1 Team micro-documentary, and New Belgium micro-documentary.   And in good content marketing practice, there is still a next step the audience can take, as is linked at the end of the film, where those who want to know more about the companies involved can continue the journey. There, they find out how they too can build the same partnership focused on creating amazing customer experiences. Woodget explains it as ""still marketing, it's just marketing that doesn't suck, delivered as real content with real value in and of itself."" And the results are telling. Not only has the documentary short version been featured at or won over fifteen film festivals to date, the campaign has some good old fashioned metrics, too. ""The content was picked up by F1 and brewing communities and ultimately resulted in over forty percent increase in traffic being driven to the target site, seven times more actions, and three times more digital engagement,"" Woodget recites. ""We're pretty excited by that."" After all, that's the sort of thing marketers love."

As I read the review, I battled conflicting emotions: happy, but disappointed that I'd miss this latest turn in Crow's refreshingly unpredictable and musically liberated career.",2015-01-14,"Sheryl Crow performs during the Rewind Tour at the Cruzan Amphitheater on September 13, 2014 in West Palm Beach, Florida. (Photo by Jeff Daly/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb49c0224000031005620a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week I stumbled upon Variety's positive review of Diner, a musical running for a limited time at Arlington's Signature Theater. The production, based on Barry Levinson's 1982 film, Diner, teamed Levinson up with Sheryl Crow. For the first time, Crow has scored a musical, and the result is a sold-out show for seven weeks. As I read the review, I battled conflicting emotions: happy for the play's positive reception and angry that I wasn't on the East Coast to see it -- disappointed that I'd miss this latest turn in Sheryl Crow's refreshingly unpredictable and musically liberated career. Sometime during the fall of 1993, I was driving home from middle school with my mom listening to WNEW, New York City's now-defunct legendary rock 'n' roll radio station. At the time, it played mostly classic rock standards, but on rare occasions a contemporary artist would slip through into rotation. These were still the days when DJs could handpick songs for their shifts and, if a new artist filtered into sets of Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones or Eric Clapton, listeners noticed. I was sitting in the front seat of the car and had already begun flipping through my math homework when I heard Scott Muni's gravely voice interrupt his daily 3 p.m. block of afternoon music. ""This is the first time we're playing this here on WNEW,"" he began. I could hear him fumbling with the plastic CD case and flipping through the liner notes to read from the track listing. ""She's Sheryl Crow, a singer from California, and this is her single, 'Leaving Las Vegas.'""The drums started, a simple beat amid handclaps. But when Sheryl Crow started to sing, the crackling rawness of her voice broke the song open and out poured a barely optimistic tale of a woman whose desperation to leave one life behind allowed for splinters of hope to start anew. It was a mesmerizing sound, a captivating tale -- and something that filled a critical void in contemporary music. By the early-1990s, I was conveniently flopping between two musical landscapes: grunge had exploded and permeated my school hallways, but having Baby Boomer parents, I also grew up on the musical greats of the 1960s and 1970s. When I heard ""Leaving Las Vegas"" for the first time, it was as if these two musical eras had collapsed into one. A month later, when I bought Tuesday Night Music Club at the local record store, I felt as though I had finally found my music. The album was a whirlwind to listen to -- a fluid trip through sounds and emotions that had the lyrical angst of the mid-1990s Gen X culture, but the music of a modern-day Big Pink. ""The Na Na Song"" spit out a force of cosmic-manic energy that somehow balanced ""I Shall Believe"" with enough poignancy to close the record with a pleading hymnal beyond just a gentle ballad. I'd listen for hours, painting pictures in my imagination of the characters in those songs. I promised myself that when I got older, I would travel through life to find my own set of characters -- to grasp the excitement and adventure that Tuesday Night Music Club awakened in me. For the next 20 years, Sheryl Crow's music played against the background of my life, becoming a steady companion through adolescence and into adulthood. There was the summer after high school graduation when my friends and I sang along to ""Everyday Is a Winding Road"" as we whipped our cars around deserted country roads into the early morning hours. Or the night of September 11, 2001 when I left a candlelight vigil and cried in my car listening to ""Riverwide"" in the parking lot, too upset to drive. Or those endless months of 14-hour workdays when I walked home from the subway on cold, snowy Brooklyn nights listening to ""There Goes the Neighborhood."" Or the day that I moved to Los Angeles and played ""Long Road Home"" while I carried boxes into a new apartment in a new city. Every album was like a new book with each song telling a unique story of a specific time and place -- sometimes through the linear reality of everyday life and others through an existential journey of amorphous self-realization.I thought about these memories as I learned more about Diner and read about the ""delicious harmonies... enhanced by insightful lyrics"" that Crow had written for the 1950's rock musical. I wondered how, in this post-MTV age where it is rare for musicians to maintain careers beyond a flash of massive popularity, Sheryl Crow has navigated decades-long relevance within a swiftly changing musical and cultural landscape. Sure, there's the versatility of her songwriting -- and years of touring and promotions. But, there is also a willingness to stray from any singular musical path that audiences have come to expect from Sheryl Crow. This freedom to take risks -- to release a contemporary country album on the heels of a Memphis R&B soul album, to duet with Pavarotti, Loretta Lynn and Kid Rock -- has led to one of the more winding musical paths of any singer-songwriter in the past 20 years. And somewhere along the way, audiences began to invest in the mystery of what twist may come next, because what is playing in a diner in Arlington today could become a new masterpiece tomorrow.Diner will be playing at the Signature Theater in Arlington, VA until January 25, 2015."

NFL players can't seem to quit when it is right, nor can athletes in any other sport.The classiest exit -- winning the critical game and going out with that as the last memory seems impossible for most athletes. Even those athletes with lifetime financial security, rewarding family lives, exciting second career possibilities can rarely do it. I have worked with some of the most talented athletes in pro sports for 40 years. They are bright and realistic on every other issue except retirement. Most pro athletes play until they are too injured to compete and there is no team that is willing to sign them. At the culmination of an exhausting season, fresh off the aches and pains and disappointments, many athletes contemplate retirement. But as spring training or training camp beckons many months later, they cannot bear to not play.This is a peer group that generally has played sports since youth. From little league and Pop Warner, these gifted athletes have become accustomed to the structure and rhythm of training and competing. Athletes love the structured time that athletics provides. Without it, they can become lost, if it is all they ever have known. This peer group loves competition and the adrenaline rush that comes from the play of the game. They become accustomed to defining their worth on the playing field. Long term health and second career are an abstraction.There is a magical quality to being part of a team, watching their teammates' backs and being supported in the same way. The camaraderie and joking that takes place in the locker room is a treasured aspect of their lives.When their skill and physical shape start to diminish, an element of denial kicks in. If the last season did not end on a positive note, they are like gamblers doubling down to win what they have lost. They are by nature optimistic, and believe in themselves, and know if they are just given another chance, things will work out.The hardest part of an agent's job is counseling players facing a retirement decision. The agent, along with loving family and friends, walk a tightrope. No prideful athlete wants to be forced into this decision. If the athlete perceives that those closest have somehow lost belief in his skills, it can make the process more difficult. It is best to try and gently reality base the athlete, while hoping he makes a decision that preserves his long term health and reputation."

With much of the U.S. facing another round of unusually cold temperatures (even for January) I'd like to share some of the ways that people are finding to help.One of the most basic things groups are doing to help the homeless is giving homelessness a face -- getting personal. Invisible People was started by Mark Horvath to let the homeless tell their own stories. Mark knows both sides of the problem. As a successful professional, he knows how upsetting it is to look at people who lack even the basic human needs when you pass them on the street. If we think there is nothing we can do, we ignore them and they become ""invisible."" But as someone who has also been homeless, Mark is taking his personal experiences and using them to combat the problem. ""The invisible guy didn't intend to become homeless. I didn't plan on living on the street. Everyone on the streets has their own story, some made bad decisions, others were victims, but none of them deserve what they have been left with, and it is a reflection of our own society that we just leave them there."" By letting people tell their own stories to the camera, Mark hopes to change the community perspective on who those people really are. Invisible People isn't the only group to take this approach. Rethink Homelessness recently published this powerful video, showing the changing face of the homeless. The 'chronic' homeless, those that come to mind with drug issues or mental illness are really only about 20% of those on the streets. Many people on the street nowadays are educated and sober, having faced a crisis in their lives that caused them to lose their homes. Some of them simply have jobs that don't quite cover the cost of living in their area.Veronika Scott's personal experience with one of those ""invisible people"" made her rethink her plans for a business. Her design class assignment was to create something that would really fill a need, so she designed a coat that also doubles as a sleeping bag for the Detroit homeless population. She took the coat around to a local shelter...and got screamed at. A homeless woman told her, "" We don't need coats ... we need jobs."" And Scott realized the truth in that statement. Scott's company The Empowerment Plan still makes the special coats, but she exclusively hires single parents to make them. Many are homeless or previously homeless; others needed an opportunity to escape other dire circumstances like prostitution. Scott says. ""Because I found the right people, they prove that this model can exist, and that it works, and that my idea isn't just a nice idea."" The Empowerment Plan website has many wonderful stories of those who work there and how they have turned their lives around. Somehow the personal touch seems to make all the difference. HandUp founded by Rose Broome and Zac Witte, combines personal stories with the power of crowdsourcing to help people change their lives. Their website features people who are looking for specific help that will enable them to make a sustainable change in their life, or help them over a rough patch so they don't become - or remain - homeless. HandUp works through partner organizations. ""These partners sign up their homeless and at-risk clients to become HandUp members, then help them redeem their HandUp donations for basic needs. They also connect HandUp members to other available resources such as food stamps, general assistance, and housing workshops."" Doniece Sandoval originally had an idea similar to HandUp, but since that organization was already doing such a good job, she moved on to another idea she wanted to make a reality. She founded LavaMae. Using a beautiful retrofitted bus, LavaMae is an initiative to provide showers and toilets to those living on the streets in San Francisco. The bus is mobile and travels to areas of the city where people are most in need. Is there anything more basic or more personal than access to sanitation? ""We're finding some of the people we service have jobs but they can't afford housing and cannot get into a shelter, so they're living in cars or on the streets,"" she said. ""In order to keep their jobs, they have to stay clean, so the gratitude we see from these people is just overwhelming and humbling."" They recently ran a very successful Indiegogo campaign to raise the money for a second bus and they are partnering with other organizations to expand further. What's amazing about helping is you never know what might come out of it. For five months, on his way to and from work, NY data engineer Patrick McConologue passed by homeless Leo Grand. One day Patrick offered Leo a choice, $100 cash, or programming lessons. Leo took the lessons, working on a laptop Patrick provided. After only a few weeks, Leo developed his own app, ""Trees for Cars."" It turns out Leo is an avid environmentalist. ""Trees for Cars is a mobile carpooling app that connects drivers and riders. Every car on the road contributes to pollution by emitting CO2. By using Trees for Cars to find rides in your area, you'll be helping the environment because more carpooling means fewer cars on the road."" The app is available for download and the money it raises will enable Leo Grand to get himself off the streets. Imagine what each of us could do if we looked more personally at homeless people..."

(AP Photo/Tom Gannam)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77756220000bb01dd1212.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"St. Louis Ram owner Stan Kroenke's plan to build a state-of-the-art football stadium in Inglewood near Hollywood Park is the most promising opportunity for the return of the NFL to Los Angeles in many years. His purchase of 60 acres proximate to Hollywood Park and a partnership with Stockbridge Capital group, who own the 238-acre former racetrack, offers promise for an integrated plan of football, retail, office, hotel and residential space. It could become a highly profitable entertainment zone just a few miles from the Los Angeles Airport.The Rams inserted a clause in their contract with the Edward Jones Dome Stadium in St. Louis, which allows them to leave or convert to a year-to-year lease if the stadium is not in the top tier of football stadia measured by certain metrics. The stadium does not meet those standards currently, and there is no support for an upgrade. Therefore, the Rams could move as soon as they have NFL approval. The NFL has asserted its ability to control who enters the Los Angeles market.Twenty years ago, prior to the move by the Rams from Anaheim to St. Louis, I heavily objected to their departure. I had grown up a Rams fan in the '50s and '60s and fell in love with the NFL watching games in the Los Angeles Coliseum. I felt that a team was not a conventionally private business -- it agreed to League restrictions, and asked a geographical area to support it in good times and bad, as if it was a civic institution. How could I explain to my son Jon the fact that the team he thought was there forever had left town?I became Co-Chm of ""Save the Rams"" with Disneyland President, Jack Lindquist, and a committee of over 100 local business people. We put together a plan for a sportstown proximate to Anaheim Stadium, a Disneyland of sports-themed rides using virtual reality. It would be a tourist destination site, with hotels and retail. It would offset the prohibitive cost of building a stadium with only 10 home dates. Instead of sitting like a white elephant with a few concerts and tractor pulls, it would be a thriving Monday-through-Sunday activity zone.We were able to persuade the NFL to veto the move at the 1994 League meetings, but Mrs. Frontiere and President John Shaw were determined to leave and got approval later.The Rams' move set a dangerous precedent. The Cardinals had moved to Phoenix. The Browns moved to Baltimore. Instead of putting new franchises in St. Louis and Baltimore, the League admitted Jacksonville and Carolina, and musical cities ensued. The Raiders left Los Angeles, and it has been an NFL wasteland for 20 years.Los Angeles has fumbled multiple opportunities to get a franchise. It could not deliver in 2000 when the League awarded it a franchise and Houston got it instead. Commissioner Tagliubue wanted a team at the Coliseum site and again the region didn't have the ability to move ahead. Then the AEG downtown site looked promising, but owner Phil Anschutz and the NFL have different agendas.Southern California has lacked political leadership to take charge. It is tax phobic, and abhors public funding. With the multiplicity of entertainment options, no massive demonstrations have occurred demanding a team. The area has never settled on one venue -- too many alternatives. The Kroenke plan will solve all that with a friendly Inglewood government.Los Angeles is the second largest market in the country. It has an enormous concentration of businesses to provide sponsorship and pay premium prices, especially the entertainment business. Fifteen million people live within a few hours of the Inglewood venue. Franchises here will shoot to the top of NFL valuations. I predict two teams will come, play in the Rose Bowl or another site until the new stadium is ready. I feel terrible for the disappointment to fans of the teams that come -- but St. Louis exhibited none of that concern when they stole the Rams.After 20 bleak years it is time to get excited. The Kroenke plan can work and bring the NFL back to Southern California. And yes, we are ready for some football!"

Voters in Oakland, California overwhelmingly approved a measure during a vote-by-mail special election for a special tax on sales of medicinal marijuana at the city's four cannabis dispenseries. The new tax rate of $18.00 per $1,000 in sales, up from $1.20 per $1,000, will generate an estimated $294,000 for the financially strapped city.

Mackenzie stood trial in July for growing medical marijuana to make an oil that he used as treatment of his tumors. He and his wife were convicted in Iowa district court for marijuana manufacturing and conspiracy. Their son, Cody, was convicted of drug possession. In a surprise ruling, the family was sentenced to probation, rather than prison. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R) signed a law last year legalizing the use of marijuana-derived CBD oil to treat epilepsy. The law focuses narrowly on ""intractable epilepsy"" and didn't apply to Mackenzie. After his conviction, Mackenzie began traveling to Oregon, where medical marijuana is legal, for treatment. Twenty-three states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes and at least 10 others have legalized medical use of CBD oil. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law.Mackenzie suffered from severe angiosarcoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer that produces large skin lesions. Photos documenting Mackenzie's legal case and his cancerous lesions have been posted to the ""Free Benton Mackenzie"" Facebook page. In July, during the trial, Loretta Mackenzie wrote on Facebook that her husband's condition had worsened and included a photo showing the large, discolored tumors on her husband's skin.Mackenzie's mother, Dottie Mackenzie, told The Quad-City Times that he was ""at peace"" with his disease and his conviction when he died.

12,BLACK VOICES,A Review of 'American Sniper',"Dwight Brown, ContributorFilm critic and travel writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-sniper_1_b_6446814.html,"His steely, icy demeanor gave Chris Kyle a steady aim, but didn't protect him from the fragile aftermath of war, particularly Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The film fluctuates between his achievements in battle and his ordeal back at home.",2015-01-14,2015-01-10-LukeGrimesandCoryHardrictasplayyoungG.I.sinthewardramaAmericanSniperSM.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-01-10-LukeGrimesandCoryHardrictasplayyoungG.I.sinthewardramaAmericanSniperSM-thumb.jpg,"This well-produced but flawed bio/war/drama follows the armed forces career and subsequent malaise of ex-Navy Seal Chris Kyle. He was a legendary sniper who did four tours of duty in Iraq. His steely, icy demeanor gave him a steady aim, but didn't protect him from the fragile aftermath of war, particularly Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The film fluctuates between his achievements in battle and his ordeal back at home.  (Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures)  Luke Grimes and Cory Hardrict play young G.I. s in the war drama American Sniper.Telling Kyle's story is the purview of filmmaker Clint Eastwood who directed Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima, and is well-acquainted with the war film genre. As was the case with those aforementioned films, Eastwood's style is never climactic. He prefers a moderate pace and a straightforward style that doesn't add anything new to the game. Helicopters buzz over Iraq. Soldiers on both sides of the battle are killed. But nothing stands out and everything appears routine, considering it's war. The proceedings lack the verve and staccato pacing that made Katherine Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty a jaw-dropping experience. His languishing, overly choreographed and pat approach makes the footage feel flat and undistinguished.After a grueling training, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) becomes a Navy Seal sniper. A sharp shooter as a kid, his skill peaks in Iraq where, he can protect platoons by accurately shooting a hostile target from as far away as a football field. Deadeye? The man kills 160 insurgents. When fellow soldiers praise him, Kyle is never less then humble. His subdued demeanor is the exact opposite of the anger and rage he incites from enemy forces who put a price on his head. No wonder they call him ""Legend."" Kyle's Navy Seals, who've teamed up with brave Marines, find something to focus on in the helter skelter war. It's the demonic Al Qaeda terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his maniacal partner The Butcher (Mido Hamada); the latter tortures victims and snitches with power drills. As Kyle and his crew hone in on the new enemies, a sharpshooter, whose talents rival Kyle's, scopes them out. Mustafa (Sammy Sheik), a Syrian sniper, has Kyle and his men in his crosshairs. First one to pull the trigger wins.The script by Jason Hall, based on the bestselling autobiography by the real Chris Kyle with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice, has plenty of slow, forward motion. When things get too tense, the plotline throws in a flashback for relief. Kyle meeting his soon-to-be-wife Taya (Sienna Miller) in a bar, trips back home on leave, the birth of two sons, phone calls from the front lines; these mini-scenes flesh out the imperfect human man behind the perfect aim -- to varied affect. You get a vague sense of the soul of this heroic soldier who tries to balance a dangerous existence with an infrequent family life. But it's hard to feel compassion for him. He's too strong a man. If the story followed a weaker person, perhaps a less successful marksman trying to prove himself with a save-the-day shot, he'd be a more compelling protagonist. As is, there's an emotional shield around Kyle that is impenetrable, even as he descends into a living hell: ""It's not the people you saved that you remember. It's the ones you couldn't save. Those are the faces and situations that stay with you forever."" Bradley Cooper's performances are not known for their range. He lacks the emotional wallop and elasticity of a Christian Bale. He's okay as the goof in the Hangover series. He stumbled across a golden opportunity with Silver Linings Playbook and turned that part, as en ex-mental patient with a bipolar disorder, into the role of a lifetime. However, he does nothing to get you under the skin of Chris Kyle. Nothing. He packed on weight for the role, but that girth isn't a substitute for an intuitive or gifted character interpretation. Sienna Miller, in only glimpses as the reluctant girlfriend turned into the concerned wife/mother, shows more depth and proves far more capable of cementing her dutiful and increasingly alarmed spouse persona. She is Kyle's only beacon out of his darkness. She is believable. Ben Reed as Wayne Kyle, the weaker younger brother, acts the part; never as strong, smart or good as his sibling. Sammy Sheik (Lone Survivor and TV's 24) as the stealth shooter Mustafa rarely speaks but powerfully commands the screen. Luke Grimes (Taken 2) and Cory Hardrict (Gran Torino) play young buck soldiers with a very credible G.I. swagger. Tom Stern's (Changeling) cinematography, Joel Cox (Unforgiven) and Gary Roach's editing, and the production design by Charisse Cardenas and James J. Murakami (Changeling) make the visuals impressionable. If the film has any air of realism, it's because of their contributions. Clint Eastwood composed ""Taya's Theme,"" the main theme music, which enhances the film in the right places. His taste in music is impeccable.There will be better films that explore PSTD. They'll be better if they focus on a sympathetic soldier and not a cold-blooded killer. They'll be better if a filmmaker with more vigor and innovation directs them. Also, if you see this film and walk out the theater feeling like you just watched 134 minutes of pro-war propaganda, it means the film failed as a character study because it spent too much time on the battlefield.

Two hundred or so of us sat in a circle around him listening intently as he talked about the importance of expressing grief and how few and far between the opportunities to do so, in a sacred space, are in today's world.   ""Our species has a lot to grieve about,"" he told our congregation of participants who were still glistening with sweat after the 18-minute dance of joy we had just completed. ""If we don't grieve, our creativity gets blocked. When we do grieve, it's like melting a big boulder in our hearts and the creativity is free to flow again.""This was my first Cosmic Mass, despite having served as Matthew's book publicist at New World Library for several years. I knew I needed to experience it for myself when the subject came up during this video interview I did with him in conjunction with the release of his recent book Meister Eckhart: A Mystic-Warrior for Our Times. Fox not only was a Catholic Priest in good standing for 25-years, he was also the most widely read theologian in North America at the time. However, he was expelled from the Dominican order in 1993 because of the forward thinking views he espoused on things like gay rights, the divine feminine, and nature based spirituality. At that time, he joined the Episcopalian Church and dedicated his life to reinventing the way we worship. ""They have us praying from the neck up . They have us reading books. Getting the text right. Getting the musical note right,"" says Fox. ""Eyes on a page are not really the way to open the heart up."" Fox believes it is essential that we incorporate the body into the practice of prayer and worship. The Cosmic Mass incorporates dancing and chanting, as well the grieving practice we were about to do.   Fox encouraged each of us to pick something specific to grieve during the ritual, whether from the world at large like global warming, police brutality, or violence in our schools, or from our individual lives like a challenging experience, unemployment, or the loss of a loved one. Before he described the posture of humility we were about to assume, Fox explained that anger or sadness could come up since both are stages of grief. He guided us to get down on our hands and knees with our forehead on the ground while paying attention to our gut, which is where grief lives in the body. He encouraged us to let out whatever sound came up as we did this, and told us to stay focused on our own sound first before gradually bringing the sounds of those around us into our awareness. I went for it completely. A deep guttural growl came from deep within my being as I got in touch with the frustration I'd been feeling around a situation in my personal life. As that frustration morphed into anger, I allowed myself to howl and scream. It was incredibly cathartic and before I knew it, tears were streaming down my cheeks, creating a small puddle on the floor in front of me.   Wails, whimpers, and screams filled the large hall for several minutes, until Matthew asked us to very gently sit up and to start toning together. Our voices united in the most soothing, healing sound of harmony. As it filled my entire being, I felt the the intensity of my emotion gradually subside. The experience cracked my heart wide open. So much so that I was holding back tears as the toning part of the mass ended. At that point, Fox and one of his co-leaders explained how we were to walk around the room with a hand on our heart offering the greeting, ""May peace be with you"" to those we encountered along the way. This offered a warm and supportive transition from the personal experience of the grieving ritual back out to the congregation at large.  The rest of service, which included communion, featured speakers, musical performances, and a final round of ecstatic dance was also quite revolutionary compared to any other other church service I've experienced. But it is the grieving ritual, by far, that most profoundly impacted me personally. So much so that I felt compelled to sit down to capture the experience in writing the very next day, which I find particularly interesting since Fox talks so much about how grieving inspires creativity. ""If we don't grieve our creativity gets blocked and nothing gets done,"" says Fox. ""We wallow in our pain. We can get hooked on victimhood, self-pity, and projection. We are not empowered to do something with our lives, passions, and energy. We can turn our creativity against ourselves in the form of self-pity, depression, and more. Unleashing pent-up grief unleashes creativity. Without it we are not fully present to life and its challenges; we lack authentic warrior energy.""What about you? What do you need to grieve? And what creative pathways might open up if you allowed yourself to go there? I encourage you to be gentle with yourself as you explore your answers to those questions and then find safe ways to express and release the anger and sadness that could very well be standing between you and your highest aspirations.
