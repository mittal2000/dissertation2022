Every year (the stores) are trying to do something bigger and better and it's cool to see.... It's the buzz of the city,"" said Brittany Wolf, 24, who helps branding for an accessories line, Theodora & Callum, in New York.In New York, the night was expected to attract tens of thousands to the approximately 900 stores, said George Fertitta, head of NYC & Company, the city's official marketing and tourism organization.In Paris, thousands converged on the city's the 8th district, blocking traffic for several hours on two boutique-studded avenues. The center of Milan was also packed with potential shoppers, many of them students, sipping from plastic glasses of free cocktails dispensed by nearby boutiques.In London, about 400 stores were participating, according to a spokesperson with Conde Nast, the giant high-end magazine publisher that owns Vogue. Sydney's night out had over 600 retailers participating, with some offering products only on sale that night, Vogue Australia said on its website.The extra publicity the night can bring to stores and designer brands is as important as getting customers out to the stores, Fertitta said.Bloomingdale's flagship department store in New York, featured members of the band Matchbox Twenty, hip-hop artist and designer Pharrell Williams, and actor Kellan Lutz from the ""Twilight Saga"" films.At Colette, a clothing and accessories boutique in Paris, celebrity stylist David Mallet applied hair extensions for shoppers while at Chloe, nearby, customers watched a cheerleader show with editor-in-chief of Vogue's French edition, Emmanuelle Alt.""(The stores) compete with each other ... in terms of who's going to be the most exciting, who's going to the most fun, who's going out be the most interesting,"" Fertitta said.""GETS PEOPLE IN THE DOOR""Organizers and designers say the event has been effective.""We always have good selling and (FNO) gets people in the door,"" said designer Rebecca Minkoff, best known for her line of handbags. She was part of New York luxury store Saks Fifth Avenue events for the night.Data from NYC & Company found that two thirds of stores who participated in 2011 and responded to their survey said store traffic increased as a result of the night.""What happens is there's a big bump in the stores the following week or 10 days after that,"" Fertitta said. ""People go and they see ... and then they go back to the stores and buy what they want the next day.""Given that retail sales have picked up over the summer, buoyed by an improving economy, stores could see an extra benefit this year.High-end retailers have fared well. Nordstrom Inc's same-store sales, a key industry gauge that tracks sales at stores open at least a year, rose more than 20 percent last month while Saks Inc and Neiman Marcus Group similarly reported strong quarterly results.In August, top U.S. retail chains such as Macy's Inc and T.J. Maxx owner TJX Cos Inc saw same-store sales rise 3.6. percent. 'LONG LINES, ALL THE SAME PARTY'Critics say that with the lines to get into stores and the full-price of items, the shopping event is underwhelming.""The lines are long and it's all the same party,"" said Ross Cameron, who was taking a subway to his home, just blocks from a main strip of New York designer stores holding events.Others like Deneene Wyatt, 26, of New York who planned to visit all her favorite stores after visiting Diane Von Furstenberg in downtown Manhattan, said she was there for the fashion not the prices.""If you like it, you're going to buy it anyway,"" she said."

Shop at a grocery or drug store that offers discounts when you buy a 6-pack. Typically you can save an additional 10 percent.Large Appliances. Check with manufacturers of large appliances.

I was 17, and my previous methods of money-making were getting wads of cash from babysitting and occasionally caring for a cousin’s decrepit cat who needed to be fed every four hours.So yes, I enthusiastically signed on to hawk for a popular deli by dressing as their mascot: a pink plush pig, a bit of a local celebrity around our town. I’d dance and wave a sign on the busiest street, beseeching those stuck in traffic to buy hams and casseroles in time for Easter. This seemed a perfectly reasonable way to amp up my integrity.“Now, we just ask that you don’t do anything stupid,” my manager said. “The last person we hired ran into the street and disrupted traffic.”“I got this,” I waved him off. Never one to cause trouble, an abiding rule-follower, I spread the word to my friends and told them to visit me at the specific street corner. Just look out for me, benignly gyrating and advertising sweet, succulent hams. “We couldn’t keep anything in stock! She sure brought in the customers,” upper management would collectively sigh when interviewing eager applicants trying to follow in my dirty hooved-steps. My skills as a porcine endorsement would be lauded forever and forever, repeated for years to come.Years later, if any portion of my work that weekend has been recounted, it has been by me only, in vaguely boozy conversations with strangers. If management mentioned the 48-hour period at all, it was surely in a cautionary addendum to an HR report, I have taken stock of a few lessons that originated in at the deli for my later and more legitimate entré into corporate life.1. Ask for help If the CamelBak you’re given for hydration runs dry, and the ice pack, meant to keep your rising body temperature cooler, strapped around your waist leaks, ask for your break. When taking your rest in the deli’s freezer, you’ll get locked in, but actually knock, forcefully, with more than one knuckle, instead of embarrassingly hoping someone comes around to let you out.2. Keep your head on and, at times, your mouth shut Standing on the corner listening to lite adult contemporary on my creaky Walkman held a thrill for only so long, (3:49 exactly: the length of Jewel’s “Intuition”), so I grew bored watching cars inch alongside the train track. My breaks weren’t frequent, and April heat in Tennessee that year was particularly punishing so I removed the snouted head often. On occasion, folks stalled at the red light started shouting “you can’t take your head off in front of the kids!” when I took one of my many breathers. A mother brought her shy daughter by, and I removed my head so I could talk freely with the kindergartener. It did not go well. Only then did I then reconsider.3. One job can lead to the next I wrote about this experience for my college applications, and although I did not attend my first-choice school, recounting my occupational failures allowed me to understand I could parlay my affinity for embellishing my own inadequacies into an actual editorial career. I didn’t really need the Myers-Briggs to help me divine my career path after all, just an anecdote about my getting locked in the freezer.4. Be smarter with your money Don’t immediately run out and blow your scant earnings on the DVD of Sweet Home Alabama, even if, at the time, you really relate to a snotty Reese Witherspoon hightailing it to Manhattan. Give it a minute. Be smarter. Take another lap around Target before bee-lining to the checkout. You’re better than this.
