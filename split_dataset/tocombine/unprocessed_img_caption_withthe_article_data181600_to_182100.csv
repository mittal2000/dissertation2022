The new data is further evidence that we're all just trying to save some money. In June, consumer spending remained flat, despite a boost in income. Americans put their extra cash into savings, raising the national savings rate to its highest level in a year. Eating at home is an easy way to cut back on costs. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the average American family spent $2,505 at restaurants in 2010. Americans typically spend about $1.7 billion every day at the nation's nearly one million restaurants, according to Consumer Reports.

3,MONEY,9 Things You Should Rent Instead Of Buy,"LearnVest, Contributor

Twelve people were killed and more than 50 wounded in the shooting attack early Friday at a packed movie theater during a showing of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Police have identified the suspected shooter as James Holmes, 24. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c159526000033007f59b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Renting a home? That we've heard of. Renting a casket? Not as much.Just last week, we told you about how the younger generation of Americans would rather rent a home than buy one. But it's becoming clear that the rental industry--which was once reserved for tuxedos, cars and movies--has become much more, covering everything from cameras to power toolsThis new trend has a ton of benefits--for one, renting an item you'll only use once or twice is much cheaper (and more sustainable) than actually buying it. Not only that, sites like Rentalic.com let you tap into nearby resources like neighbors and community members to borrow items. Saving money and staying local? Now that's a movement we can get behind.Dresses Let's face it--most of us don't have the cash to splurge on designer dresses, let alone shoes and accessories to go with them. That's why we love the new trend of renting dresses: Sites like Rent the Runway and Lending Luxury allow users to borrow dresses for 3-5 days for as little as 10% of the retail value (plus Rent the Runway will send two sizes). To snag a matching clutch or handbag, check out Bag Borrow or Steal.Power Tools Whether cleaning the carpet, fixing up the garden or just taking on a day of home improvement, power tools can often come in handy. But instead of splurging on one-time-use hardware, check out the rental options at your local Home Depot or Lowes. These stores offer everything from power washers to paint sprayers for daily or weekly rentals.Video Games Hooked on Wii Boxing? We understand. Unfortunately, video games can get pricey and replenishing your collection can be tough on budgets. To keep the variety at a lower cost, try renting games from sites like GameFly and GameMine. These resources are just like Netflix, with a flat monthly rate, quick and free shipping and large libraries of games to select.Textbooks There's no denying it: College is becoming increasingly more expensive. That's why we love the idea of renting textbooks--it's an easy way to save each semester. While there are a ton of book rental sites, we especially like Book Renter for its library of over 5 million books (plus free shipping!), and Chegg, which puts a priority on low prices. In some cases, you may even be allowed to highlight or take notes in book margins. Camera Lenses Ever wanted to capture a wedding or a graduation with a professional-grade camera, but didn't want to shell out thousands of dollars? Sites like LensRentals.com and BorrowLenses.com now allow users to rent lenses or camera bodies for much cheaper than the cost of the normal hardware. With added bonuses like overnight shipping and quality customer service, budding photographers will love these options.Parking Space If you regularly commute to a crowded city, finding parking can be a huge hassle--and parking garages are notoriously expensive. For an easier alternative, consider renting a parking space. Sites like ParkingSpacesforRent, and ParkAtMyHouse allow individuals to list their available parking spaces online. Then, users can search for a space based on location, type and time period, and rent directly with the owner.Casket The average American funeral can cost anywhere from $8,000 to $10,000, with the average casket ringing in at $2,000 (although nice models can reach up $10,000 or more). Recently, funeral homes have been giving families the opportunities to rent caskets for a much smaller price--over $1,000 less. Renting a casket is as simple as asking the funeral director about your options. You can read more about the trend here. Tech Hardware Buying new technology hardware can be a huge investment--but with new models coming out every year, it's so important for businesses to stay current. Sites like Rent Smart allow small business owners to borrow all kinds of tech hardware, from iPads to smartphones, for several years at a low weekly rate. Get ready to upgrade your home office--without breaking the bank.Everything Else If all else fails, watershed sites like Rentalic.com and SnapGoods.com allow anyone to post any item or service for rent. Whether you're looking for a beach chair or a gorilla costume, both sites let the user connect with individuals in their community. Users save money, with the added bonus of making the most of local resources.More From LearnVest 9 Creative Storage Solutions Under $20The 7 Rules of Interior DesignSign Up for Free Out of Debt Bootcamp!LearnVest is the leading personal finance site for women.

They're hard to turn down and easy to gulp down on a hot summer day, but if you've ever read the list of ingredients found on many boxes, you might think twice. We'd like to think that these delicious bars are made of nothing but chocolate, milk and maybe some sugar, but instead they include ingredients like cellulose gum, high fructose corn syrup, polysorbate 80 and carrageenan. Some brands, however, feature an ingredient list that's a little more on the pure side. We decided to bundle both ends of the spectrum together in a blind taste test. We tasted seven frozen fudge bars, judging on flavor and texture. We were happily surprised to find that the winners didn't include any ingredients that horrified us.Find out who the winners are in our slideshow below.As always, this taste test is in no way sponsored or influenced by the brands involved."

The Commerce Department says new-home sales fell 1.6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 313,000 homes. Sales have fallen nearly 7 percent since December.

When you're new to money management, these answers might not seem clear, but they become clear with time. But my favorite personal finance dilemmas are those to which there are no wrong answers, only good solutions.For example, an anonymous GRS reader recently wrote wondering what to do with a large chunk of money. Here's her story:This has been a good year. In fact, it's been a great one. I'm 48, self-employed and thanks to a variety of circumstances, I'm going to pull in four times my usual annual income. I've paid off my car and student loans, have no credit card debt, and my emergency fund  is fully stocked. I've refinanced my underwater house and, with insurance and taxes, my monthly housing cost is $750.Our anonymous friend is in a great position, and each of these choices is good. The questions is: Which choice is best? Unfortunately, there's no way to know.One problem we face when making any sort of investment is that we can't see the future. If we could, investing would be easy. Sure, we can look at the past and make some educated guesses about what's likely to happen. But these guesses -- even when made with the best information available -- are still nothing more than guesses. In the end, we have no way to be sure which investment will provide the best return on our money in the future.[Note: It's for this reason that diversification is so important. When you diversify your investments, you spread the risk. You opt not to put all your eggs in one basket. Sure, your investment returns won't be as great as if you'd have guessed right; however, they'll be significantly greater than if you guessed wrong.]I've actually been wrestling with a dilemma similar to the one faced by this anonymous reader.For the past six months, I've been renting an apartment. My lease goes through the end of January. But mortgage rates are very low right now. Home prices seemed to have stopped falling. In fact, I've heard tales that the real estate market in Portland has begun to sizzle again. (It's not uncommon to hear tales of houses selling after just a few days on the market.) It seems to me that now might be a great time to buy.On Monday, I had lunch with a GRS reader who rents the top floor of a home near me. She told me her landlord plans to put the place on the market. She says it's a lovely building and her landlord has put a lot of effort into making the place shine. I could afford to buy the place and could then rent out the top floor to offset part of the mortgage.But should I buy a home just because interest rates are low and prices are good? And should our anonymous friend by her dream home just because it's now within the realm of possibility? These are tough questions. And they're big questions. Buying a home is usually the biggest financial decision any of us make in our lives!I'm not sure what I'll do in my case. (I know I won't make any sort of serious moves until mid-October, after I've returned from my trip to Turkey.) But what about the reader who asked this question? What's her best option?If you were in this position -- your only debt was your mortgage, you had ample emergency savings, and you had an extra chunk of cash -- what would you do? Would you consider buying your dream property while renting out your existing home? Would you invest the money in some other way? Would you pay off your current mortgage and save even more before buying a new home? Is there any one right answer?This article originally appeared on  www.GetRichSlowly.org."
