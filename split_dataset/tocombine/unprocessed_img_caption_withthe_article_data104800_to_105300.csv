0,POLITICS,Don't Throw Billions at an Obsolete Nuclear Arsenal,"William Hartung, ContributorWriter and Foreign Policy Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dont-throw-billions-at-an_b_6164012.html,"Before we spend billions on various short-term fixes to the Pentagon's existing nuclear enterprise, let's rethink the hundreds of billions the department wants to spend on nuclear weapons we don't need at prices we can't afford.",2014-11-15,"ARLINGTON, VA - NOVEMBER 14: U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announces a series of reforms to the troubled nuclear force during a press briefing at the Pentagon November 14, 2014 in Arlington, Virginia. The measures are designed to shore up the US military's troubled nuclear force after a spate of incidents exposed management and morale problems. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dd3e210000d601c96780.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced the results of two reviews of current practices for maintaining the nation's nuclear arsenal. A hard look at the troubled nuclear enterprise was certainly needed in the light of the scandals it has experienced in the past several years, from widespread cheating on competency exams to mishandling of weapons. But unfortunately the review panel's recommendations miss the forest for the trees.Perhaps no element of the Pentagon's narrative about what's ailing its nuclear force is more emblematic of the department's misdiagnosis of the problem than the tale of the lonely wrench. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel reported that the nation's three Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) sites had been sharing a single wrench kit needed for specialized maintenance, Fedexing it back and forth as needed. The implication seemed to be that the nuclear enterprise was so starved for funds and attention that it couldn't even keep basic tools in stock.But other lessons can and should be drawn from this incident. Obviously, if having more than one wrench kit was truly essential to our national security, the Pentagon could easily have afforded it out of its multi-billion dollar budget for strategic forces, without a new infusion of funds. This was clearly an issue of mismanagement, not lack of funding.But another lesson may be drawn as well. ABC News learned that the wrench kit has barely been used in recent years:The wrench in question is officially known as a Heat Shield Counter-bore Tool and was originally used for the now-defunct Peacekeeper missile. But it was needed again when the Minuteman III's weapon system was upgraded, but it has seldom been used. The toolkit has been used less than five times since 2008.So, if the Pentagon needs a few more wrenches, by all means buy them. But don't try to use this story as part of a plea for billions in additional funding.There are no doubt issues related to training, morale and equipment that should be addressed as part of sustaining the nuclear arsenal. But the real question is what that arsenal is for. In a comment on this issue for a piece done by Mark Thompson for Time magazine, Kingston Reif of the Arms Control Association gave an excellent summary of what purpose our current arsenal serves and why it is much larger than it needs to be: Apart from deterring a nuclear attack, nuclear weapons play an increasingly limited role in U.S. national security policy, but our arsenal is still configured for a Cold War world that no longer exists. There are simply no plausible military missions for these weapons given their destructive power, the current security environment and the prowess of U.S. conventional forces.Put another way, we should use the attention that the two recent reviews have brought to the Pentagon's nuclear enterprise to think about restructuring the force to bring it into line with our actual security needs. Separate studies by analysts at the Air War College and the Naval War College have suggested that a few hundred deliverable warheads are sufficient to deter any nation from attacking the United States or its allies with nuclear weapons. And even the Pentagon has acknowledged that we could cut deployed warheads by one-third from the levels established in the New START treaty and still fulfill its vision of the nuclear mission. The best policy at a time of constrained resources is to hold off on building a new generation of nuclear delivery vehicles while we take a closer look at what is really needed. A report by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies has estimated that modernizing and sustaining the nuclear triad of bombers and land- and sea-based ballistic missiles will cost roughly $1 trillion between now and the mid-2030s. Just one new ballistic missile submarine is estimated to cost $5.5 billion, even before the inevitable cost overruns. Depending how they are configured and deployed, a new generation of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles could cost anywhere from $20 billion to $120 billion. And the Air Force wants 100 new nuclear capable bombers at $550 million a pop. All of these projects are at an early enough stage in their development that a much needed course correction would be relatively easy to accomplish, given the will and the wisdom to do so.  Even a modest restructuring of the force could save tens of billions of dollars. In a recent report entitled ""The Unaffordable Arsenal,"" the Arms Control Association proposes changes in nuclear modernization plans that would save $70 billion over the next decade. The proposals include delaying the development of a new bomber and a new ICBM; canceling the planned Air-Launched Cruise Missile; and reducing the buy of new ballistic missile submarines to eight from 12 while maintaining the capability to launch the same number of warheads. Further reductions in the size of U.S. nuclear forces would drive these savings numbers even higher.So before we spend billions on various short-term fixes to the Pentagon's existing nuclear enterprise, let's rethink the hundreds of billions the department wants to spend on nuclear weapons we don't need at prices we can't afford. Meanwhile, you'll be glad to know that Chuck Hagel has announced that the Pentagon will spring for some more wrenches.--William D. Hartung is the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy"

Delay has a direct impact on the future my children will have - and that's not acceptable to me."" -- Letha TawneyThis week, by reaching an agreement on emissions with China, President Obama opened a door to seriously addressing climate change. The agreement was seen by pundits as Obama's act of defiance in the face of the new GOP Congress, rather than the sensible and long overdue agreement that it was. But as political energy and coverage shifts to the Presidential race in 2016, voters can exercise pressure on likely candidates to own urgently addressing our climate, not putting it on the back burner as every campaign since 2008 has done. Hillary Clinton is reported to be embarking on a listening tour, gathering ideas for a 2016 run. Let's ask Hillary to lead on climate change- to own the issue and not just drop it in as a talking point when the audience is receptive or the time is right. And if you're a Republican who knows climate change is real: take a stand and encourage your favorite 2016 candidate to stop denying and own climate change. The direction of climate policy in the United States will largely be determined by our next president. And anyone who knows me knows that I'm hoping that person will be Hillary Clinton. The air of inevitability surrounding a Clinton presidential campaign seems tied to climate policy as well. According to The New York Times:The architect of Mr. Obama's climate change plan is none other than his senior counselor, John D. Podesta, who is likely to leave the White House next year to work as the chairman of Mrs. Clinton's campaign.We know Clinton understands the grave implications of not acting on climate change. We know she is one of the good ones (although she will need to clarify her position on fracking). And it seems as though -- if she does run -- her climate policy would fall closely in line with what Obama adviser John Podesta has outlined for the current administration. Clinton recently called climate change as ""the most consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of challenges we face as a nation and a world.""But I bet it won't be on her top three campaign talking points, and this is a shame. It's time for Hillary Clinton to speak up again on the issue of climate change and make her voice heard in support of strong measures to reduce emissions and slow global warming. And this isn't just the right thing to do morally or the smart thing to do practically. If Clinton runs in 2016, it will be an electorally savvy move. The New York Times points out a ""variety of polls show that a majority of American voters now believe that climate change is occurring, are worried about it, and support candidates who back policies to stop it."" A 2014 poll by the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, meanwhile, found that majorities of women, minorities and young people support candidates who strongly endorse climate action.In a recent poll conducted by Gallup, the group it termed ""Concerned Believers"" in climate change were more likely to be women than men (60% vs. 40%). According to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, 75% of women ""see global warming as a serious problem"". Hillary Clinton, should she run for president, will need women and young people. And though it's highly likely she would win those demographics handily regardless of whether or not she speaks out now on climate change, she can only bolster her standing with those groups by doing so. The Yale Project on Climate Change Communication found that though registered voters are 2.5 times more likely to vote for a candidate who strongly supports action to reduce global warming, registered voters are three times more likely in opposition to a candidate who ""strongly opposes action to reduce global warming"". And here's even better news: business leaders (or at least half of them) recognize how serious the issue is and are pushing forward to meet their own goals. Letha Tawney, mother and senior associate at the World Resources Institute, says, ""I'm pushing open doors to deploy more renewable energy faster and continuing to drive down its cost so that it can continue to expand on a purely business basis -- politics aside. It turns out businesses want renewable energy -- nearly 50 percent of the Fortune 500 have plans to buy renewable energy already.""We know if Hillary runs, women will be the cornerstone of her campaign. Well, climate change is a women's issue. It's a mother's issue. As Moms Clean Air Force head Dominique Browning writes, ""No politician wants to make a mother angry. And nothing makes us angrier than threats to the little (and big) ones we love so dearly.""The weather has gotten to strange and too dramatic to ignore. Just in the last year, we've watched California suffer through one of the worst droughts on record, with 60 precent of the state now dealing with ""exceptional drought"". Despite the cold temperatures much of North America experienced this past year, 2014 is likely to tie as the hottest year on record -- though the NOAA maintains that 2014 could end up being the hottest ever if current temperature patterns persist through the end of the year.Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, saw the impact of global warming for women collecting water in Bangladesh but also on soccer moms in drought ridden California. Now, she must listen to concerned voters and have the courage to highlight climate change as a top, top campaign issue. She understands how global warming is tied up with the fates of women and girls globally. It's time for Clinton to stand and speak the truth of global warming both at home and abroad. It is the smart and the right thing to do.

Despite the very real challenges facing the leaders who will gather, this generation of Arab Americans can approach the future with some confidence given the progress that has been made the last three decades. Thirty years ago, the obstacles confronting the community were quite different. Back then, Arab Americans, as an organized constituency, were excluded from the mainstream of American political life. Candidates rejected our endorsements and support; political parties ignored or excluded us; and, for many, simply being of Arab descent was seen as a liability in politics. Just a generation ago, young Arab Americans felt the need to hide their ethnicity to run for office or to secure an appointment to a federal post. In Washington, only a handful of Arab Americans worked in government or in organizations and think-tanks that focused on issues of concern to the community. As wrong as it would be to ignore the reality of the problems remain, it would be equally wrong to ignore how much has changed.   Today, there are hundreds of proud Arab Americans working in the federal government, in Congress, in human and civil rights groups, and in policy-formulating institutions in Washington. It is important to note that many of these public servants got their start as staff or interns working for Arab American organizations. In addition, there is now a network of Arab American elected officials that includes over 400 current and former Members of Congress and state and local officials from across the U.S. In the mid-1980s, there was no recognized ""Arab American vote"". Today, in places like Dearborn, MI, Paterson, NJ, Chicago, IL, and Northern VA, politicians know that Arab Americans are organized and vote. They, therefore, campaign to earn the community's support. And Arab Americans now sit in leadership positions in the political parties on the national, state and local levels. I recall back in 1985, the first challenge we faced at the newly formed Arab American Institute was the threat to our community in Dearborn. They had been denounced by the leading candidate for mayor as the city's ""Arab problem"". After a decade of voter registration efforts and solid grass roots organizing by community organizations, no one who cared for their political future dared to repeat such an insult. Today, four of Dearborn's City Council Members are Arab Americans, as is the Council's President, as well as the head of Dearborn's Democratic Party. Much the same could be seen in Paterson, NJ, where in 2012 an Arab American backed Congressman beat back challenges by two opponents (one of whom was a Congressman who had lost his district to reapportionment), both of whom had been supported by hard-line pro-Israel groups. Despite these real electoral gains, many will focus instead at the challenges we continue to face and with a jaundiced eye and make the case that no progress has been made. They are wrong. To be sure, the challenges have grown more daunting, but we are now stronger and better organized and more able to face them down. One of these critics once challenged me saying that I was guilty of saying ""the glass was half full, when it was really half empty"". I responded by telling him that neither was the case since I could recall a time when we didn't have a glass to fill. And now we do!We don't need to be reminded of the difficulties that have shaped the current landscape: the terror attacks of 9/11 and the backlash and threat to civil liberties that followed; the devastating impact of the invasion and occupation of Iraq; the collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the wars that have taken such a horrific toll; the unraveling of the ""Arab Spring"" and the nightmare conflict in Syria; and the spread of extremist currents and the danger they pose to the region.We have been confronted by all of these challenges and more. Instead of cowering, we faced them head on -- and along the way, we've won some little, but important, victories. For example, if we had not been organized and had the allies we had worked hard to develop, we would have been overwhelmed by the 9/11 backlash. Instead of being defeated, we were able to defend our community, educate millions about our history and culture, and win important precedent-setting cases against those who threatened our rights. We were able to secure protection for Syrian immigrants in the US and to expand refugee status for Iraqis fleeing conflict in their country. At critical junctures, we were able to shape the official response to Israel's brutal assault on Palestinians and Lebanese. We have also been able to challenge the disgraceful manner in which law-enforcement treated our community -- which has forced the Department of Justice to rethink their approach to how they deal with us. And just this year, together with allies, we were able to effectively block a Congressional measure that would have mandated that Israel be entered into the US's visa waiver program. In response to our appeals, the State Department made it clear that as long as Israel continued to discriminate against Arab Americans they would not qualify for visa waivers. So when a new generation of Arab American activists gather in Washington to lay the groundwork for their political work for the next two years, they will have the wind at the backs. The community will want to make sure that candidates who run for office in 2016 understand the realities of the Middle East today and that they are sensitive to the concerns that our community will bring into the national debate. They will do so with determination and confidence. Determination, because they know that the domestic and foreign policy issues for which they are advocating are important not only to Arab Americans, but to all Americans. And confident, because they have a proud record on which to build. Follow @AAIUSA for more."

The president is taking part in all the (G20) events.""Western nations have imposed successive rounds of sanctions on Moscow, accusing it of sending troops and tanks to back pro-Russian rebels fighting to break away from Ukraine. Russia denies the charges.The measures, aimed at sectors like oil and banking, as well as individuals close to Putin, are squeezing Russia's economy at a time when falling oil prices are straining the budget and the rouble has plunged on financial markets.Obama said the United States was at the forefront of ""opposing Russia's aggression against Ukraine, which is a threat to the world, as we saw in the appalling shoot-down of MH17"" -- a reference to the downing of a Malaysian airliner over rebel-held territory on July 17, with the loss of 298 lives.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the European Union was considering further financial sanctions against Russian individuals because of the crisis in Ukraine.""The present situation is not satisfying,"" she told reporters. ""At present the listing of further persons is on the agenda.""Putin's isolation was evident with his placing on the outer edge for the formal G20 leaders' photograph. While Obama and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping were met by Australia's governor general and attorney general when they arrived in Brisbane, Putin was greeted by the assistant defense minister.Despite being under intense pressure, Putin was all smiles, shaking hands with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The host had threatened to ""shirt front,"" or physically confront, Putin over the downing of MH17, in which 28 Australians died. ONLY TOPICA Kremlin spokesman said the Ukraine crisis was the only topic discussed at a one-on-one meeting between Putin and British Prime Minister David Cameron, but he added both expressed interest in ""ending confrontation"" and rebuilding relations. Putin also met French President Francois Hollande, and both agreed to protect their ties from the effects of sanctions, the spokesman said.The European Union demanded Moscow withdraw troops and weapons from Ukraine and put pressure on rebels there to accept a ceasefire, after the latest fighting wrecked a truce agreed in September.EU foreign ministers will meet on Monday to assess the situation in Ukraine and whether further steps including additional sanctions are needed against Russia, said European Council President Herman Van Rompuy. Obama plans to meet European leaders to discuss the matter on Sunday, he added.Outside the summit, Ukrainian Australians staged an anti-Putin protest, wearing headbands reading ""Putin, Killer.""Draped with the flags of the nations that lost citizens when flight MH17 was shot down, the demonstrators lay on a large Ukrainian flag, in what they said was a protest at the ""murderous acts"" Russia's president was responsible for.Russian state-controlled TV on Friday broadcast what it called ""sensational"" photographs supporting Moscow's version that the plan was downed by a Ukrainian fighter jet, but several commentators described the pictures as fakes.

We should be, according to Aidan White, the director of the Ethical Journalism Network (EJN), who expressed concern about the crisis of hate speech in the Arab region, fueled in great part by the media.""One of the difficulties is defining hate speech,"" he said at a three-day seminar entitled Building Trust and Tolerance in Beirut this week. ""Governments define it to serve their own interests."" Aidan White and a five-point test for hate (Abu-Fadil)Given the importance of countering such venom, the pervasiveness of corruption, as well as constant government interference, White asked why there wasn't a regional center to deal with hate speech in the media.He described EJN's five-point test on hate speech as the status of the speaker, the reach of the speech, the intention of the speaker, the content and form of speech, and, the economic, social and political climate in which it exists.The event, organized by EJN, the Beirut-based Maharat Foundation and the Norwegian Institute of Journalism grouped experts from across the Middle East and North Africa.""There's a great need to shed light on hate speech that leads to murder and other crimes,"" said Abdel Salam Sidahmed, the Middle East regional representative at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), adding that racism was on the rise on the Internet and in social media. The BBC's Arabic channel aired a documentary called ""An Qorb"" (Up Close) about satellite TV stations in the Middle East that spread hate speech.Sidahmed acknowledged an increase in recent years in stereotyping, sedition and racism and that there were no successful control mechanisms to halt hate speech, notably in the media. I Hate You: Hate Speech and Sectarianism in Arab Spring Media is a good example of what we face today. It's a 385-page book of well-documented case studies from across the region.

There are regular calls to end sedition and sectarianism in Lebanon, I noted, but said there were no serious efforts to hold the media, bloggers and activists accountable, without resorting to draconian measures like jail sentences and banning of outlets.Depending on who the paymaster is, Lebanon's media often add fuel to the fire by perpetuating or starting rumors.  Screen shot of Lebanese Foreign Minister's tweet, a throwback to civil war Reports of a threat by legislator Antoine Zahra from the Lebanese Forces (LF) party against Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil from the opposing Free Patriotic Movement caused a stir on Twitter last week.A citizen asked Bassil in a tweet what he thought of the threat. The minister replied he was afraid of losing a pack of bread in his car, in reference to Zahra, who, according to civil war stories, used to man an LF militia checkpoint and pinch bread from passersby at gunpoint. I pointed to the Arabic Online Media Ethics Guide I launched with colleague Rouba El Helou last May to help online journalists, bloggers and activists publish acceptable content. Arabic Online Media Ethics Guide (Abu-Fadil)I also referred to the Council of Europe's Hate Speech Watch, a collection of definitions linked to different aspects of hate speech. Screen shot of Hate Speech WatchThe seminar's participants agreed censorship was an unacceptable option but that media may revert to self-censorship to avoid getting in harm's way.Lara Zaloum, operations manager at LBCI TV in Lebanon, said her newsroom team had often cut live broadcasts, stating technical difficulties, so as not to subject reporters to danger or death threats from warring factions. Bahrain is a prime example of hate speech, notably against Shiites and any anti-government forces, said dissident Ali Dairy of Miraat Al Bahrain (Bahrain Mirror), a newspaper and website produced outside his Arab Gulf country. Bahrain Mirror and 2013 Harvest (Abu-Fadil)Bahrain's population is predominantly Shiite Muslim while the country's ruling family is of the minority Sunni sect. The cover of the paper's maiden issue in May 2012 screamed out ""Bahraini Press: Speaking Out or Death."" The organization also produced a compendium of 2013 human rights violations by authorities.Egypt's Mohamed Abdel Rahman, editor of www.e3lam.org, said ignorance, ethnocentrism and being unable to live with people was feeding hatred in his country, which, in turn, was reflected in the media. The revolution that toppled president Hosni Mubarak, successive governments, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the current regime that ousted Brotherhood president Mohamad Morsi have sprouted an avalanche of hate speech in Egyptian media.""We have sectarianism, political, social, and geographic hatreds,"" he said. ""It's normal for people to be aggressive, to want to fight, and (TV) talk shows are platforms for fights."" The seminar that included participants from Syria, Yemen, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Iraq, Algeria and Turkey ended with an eight-point statement to combat hate speech and promote actions to further ethics, good governance and self-regulation."

Not only do you get a lot more personal space on a cruise, but the technology found on cruise ships is getting more useful with each new ship.For example, even with over 4,000 passengers and their luggage to get onboard its new Quantum of the Seas, RCCL promises to get you from the sidewalk to the ship in 10 minutes or less. Good luck doing that at the airport. Here are a few of the technology innovations on RCCL's new Quantum of the Seas, the first of three ships in its class, and without a doubt the most technologically advanced ship afloat.  1. Sidewalk to Ship in Ten MinutesYou check in online. Instead of waiting in a long line to have your ID photo taken, fill out forms, and get your stateroom keys, you take a selfie, load it to the online check-in website, fill out your passport info, and then print out a boarding pass. You show the boarding pass at security, proceed to your stateroom where you'll find your keys. The goal is ""sidewalk to ship"" in ten minutes, and it really does work.  2. ""WOW"" Wristbands Replace Key CardsNot only will you find the usual key card to open your door, get on and off the ship, and pay for onboard purchases, but you'll also get a wristband (called a WOWband) that performs all the functions of a room key and more. Strap it on your wrist and you'll never have to fumble to find your key, or have it demagnetize if it comes in contact with your credit cards. It's waterproof so you can wear it while splashing around in the pools and hot tubs. Very clever.3. High(er)-speed internetThe Quantum uses a new type of satellite that tracks the ship's movement and hovers lower in the sky than other satellites used for Internet access, so it's faster and more reliable. Maybe not exactly what you might have at home, but comparable to a DSL line. There's also WiFi throughout the ship, with no dead spots.4. Tablet-equipped staffWherever you go, crew members have tablets to provide information or speed you through check-in for dinner reservations and other functions. When you show up for a meal, staff greet you, ask for your cabin number, and direct you to your table. So there's less waiting in line. In dining venues, waiters take your order on tablets and send them directly to the kitchen, speeding up service.5. Royal iQ app Compatible with iOS and Android devices, this app lets you plan, change, and share your schedule (spa appointments, dinner reservations, shore excursions, etc.) while on ship. And speaking of devices, all cabins now come with USB charging ports. In addition, there are 45 iQ stations around the ship that interact with your WOWband and provide information about your schedule and the ship. And you can call or text other app users onboard.  6. Radio frequency ID luggage trackingRFID luggage tags, in combination with the Royal iQ app, let you track the progress of your luggage from dockside to stateroom. No more guessing when your bags will arrive.7. RobotsAnd for a bit of whimsy, the ship has two robotic bartenders. Guests order drinks via a tablet and the robots get busy mixing cocktails. You have to see (and drink) it to believe it. And no tipping is expected."

In his 'Report prior to discussion' presented Tuesday morning to Synod Fathers and Fraternal delegates, the relator general Cardinal Peter Erdo, pointed to the 'privatization of love' as the greatest challenge to the family. (Photo by Franco Origlia/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f3043c000020010db0e5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Catholic Church at this moment in history is faced with a rising chorus of right-wing dissent. This movement poses a threat to Pope Francis's reforms, but the threat should not be overblown. The self-proclaimed leader of the resistance movement has become Cardinal Raymond Burke. To understand both the nature of the threat, and its limits, a closer look at Cardinal Burke is warranted.Born in 1948 in small-town Wisconsin, Burke is a man of obvious intelligence. Up to now, he has enjoyed a meteoric rise through the Church's hierarchy. He was made bishop of La Crosse, Wisconsin, in 1994, at the youthful age of forty-six and eight years later was promoted to Archbishop of St. Louis. And in 2008, he was named Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura, essentially the Chief Justice of the most important of the Vatican courts.Burke built his career on highly public confrontations. In 2004, he declared that he would not give Holy Communion to Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Four years later, he called on St. Louis University, a Jesuit college, to dismiss its basketball coach, Rick Majerus, for endorsing Hillary Clinton and announcing that he was ""personally pro-choice."" (The college refused to follow Burke's advice). And in 2009, he attacked Catholics who voted for Barack Obama. No Catholic, he said, who knew of the President's positions on the family or on same-sex marriage ""could have voted for him with a clear conscience.""And if in public Burke climbed the ladder of ecclesial success through increasingly hysterical attacks not just on politicians but on ordinary Catholics who did not share his political priorities, away from the limelight he was busy helping to construct a dense network of ""traditionalists.""The traditionalist movement is not widely known. It is centered around devotion to the pre-Vatican II Latin Mass and a restoration of the elaborate liturgical rituals of the Renaissance and Baroque periods. During his time in La Crosse, Burke's most direct contribution to this movement was to found a traditionalist men's religious order, the Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem.The Order is entirely pre-Vatican II. Now headquartered in West Virginia, the Canons celebrate the old pre-Vatican II Latin Mass and follow the pre-Vatican liturgical calendar. To take one small example: Even though the rest of the Catholic Church celebrates the Feast of Christ the King in mid-November, Cardinal Burke's Order prefers to do it in late October, the way it was done before 1965.Nor is this the only traditionalist movement Burke has supported. In St. Louis, according to one priest, he brought in ""hermits . . . or consecrated virgins"" who were ""just not psychologically equipped"" for the lives they vowed to lead, but who shared Burke's hostility and suspicions about the larger world.Almost from the beginning of Pope Francis's pontificate, Cardinal Burke has used his position as Prefect of the Signatura to issue ever more incendiary, if not openly insubordinate attacks on the Pope and the whole modern Church. In July, 2013, he argued for a return to the old Latin liturgy, while denouncing contemporary liturgy as ""strictly correlated with a lot of moral corruption."" In December, 2013, he attacked Pope Francis for advocating the wrong agenda: ""He thinks we're talking too much about abortion, too much about the integrity of marriage as between one man and one woman."" ""But we can never talk enough about that.""In that same interview, he attacked the Pope for a second reason, suggesting that it was constitutionally impossible for the Pope to reform the Roman Curia, a sixteenth-century bureaucratic invention: ""The service of the Roman Curia is part of the very nature of the Church, and so that has to be respected."" In March, 2014, he denounced the Pope for wishing to simply the annulment process. The Pope, he cautioned, was falling prey to ""false mercy.""This crescendo of insubordination peaked at the Synod on the Family this past October. Making himself the public ""face of the opposition to Pope Francis's reformist agenda,"" Cardinal Burke assailed the Pope's leadership as ""like a ship without a rudder.""  One is legitimately entitled to ask: Just how loyal is Cardinal Burke to the Church of the last fifty years?Pope Francis responded in the only way he could, by dismissing Burke from his position as Prefect. This was absolutely the correct decision, even though it was met with the predictable screams of discontent from right-wing websites like Rorate Caeli. On November 12, 2014, Rorate Caeli gave prominent place to an essay by the former Italian academic Roberto de Mattei.  Five years ago, de Mattei became the center of controversy in Italy when he helped to obtain governmental funding for the publication of a book that denounced the theory of evolution. It was a flawed project that even drew the condemnation of Pope Benedict's Vatican.This same de Mattei was now leading the charge for Cardinal Burke. The Pope, de Mattei alleged in histrionic language, has severed Burke's head like John the Baptist and served it on a platter to reform-minded cardinals. The implication is clear: Burke is the martyred prophet, the Pope is King Herod, and the reformers collectively are Salome. Nor is de Mattei alone. The right-wing American Catholic writer James Schall speculated just the other day about the best ways to deal with a heretical pope.The circle gathered around Burke is a fringe movement. They are dissidents in the truest sense of that word. Cardinal Burke blames the modern liturgy for ""moral corruption?"" Really. Such allegations are best treated as a kind of bad joke. He has waged an eighteenth-month long campaign of vilification directed at the sitting Pope. It is unthinkable that a Cardinal should attempt to sow such discord in the Church.In a misguided column in late October, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat warned Pope Francis against ""reassign[ing] potential critics in the hierarchy."" This was clearly a veiled reference to Burke's impending dismissal from the Signatura. Douthat's concern was that the Pope might thereby prompt a schism.A schism is not going to happen. Raymond Burke and his tiny band of followers are not about to march into that wilderness. What is happening, however, is that Pope Francis is not indulging the traditionalists in the way Pope Benedict once did. The Pope knows well how few the traditionalists are in numbers and how self-referential is their focus. There are not many Catholics who are moved to tears at the sight of Renaissance vestments; or who long for a return to liturgies in a foreign tongue; or who wish to repudiate fifty years of development since Vatican II. Not many Catholic women want to return to the days of wearing scarves or head coverings at Mass. I can appreciate nostalgia within limits, but the Burkean project is nostalgia for a golden age, a romanticized past that never was and that cannot be recreated now.Pope Francis, in contrast, wishes to have a Catholic Church that looks more like Jesus's earthly ministry. He wants the Church to reach out to the poor and the marginalized, a Church that shows love and solidarity with those whom society despises or discards. Pope Francis knows that Jesus did not retreat from the world behind a cloud of incense and lace, but engaged with it, in all its messiness.This is the trumpet sound that Catholics should follow. For in the end, Burke's way is a dead end, a retreat into a clericalized grandeur, Catholicism transformed into grand opera, perhaps, or a museum exhibit. It is, in the end, spectacle, not a living faith."

(AP Photo/Mel Evans)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f3052600002d0183723a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama came to Princeton University and met with a select group of students to discuss part of the University's informal motto, ""In the service of all nations."" The motto was coined by Woodrow Wilson, and is the aspirational tag line, if you will, for the University. We asked this most famous Buddhist monk to reflect on the meaning of service as a way to think candidly among ourselves. Service has become a regular part of high school and college life in the past decades. Almost every student commits to some: out of their own initiative, urged to do so, or required. The role of His Holiness was to draw attention to service beyond those already interested, and to allow for a sincere conversation about its meaning- something he seemed naturally to elicit. In preparation, students met in small groups to learn from each other and to prepare a question. They asked themselves what counted as service, why engage in it, and what did they learn along the way? Were there problems with the idea of service, from the place they came from?The questions, initiated by a panel of scholars, were provocative through their self-reflective and honest nature: recognizing Princeton's place of privilege, wondering about the relationship between service and scholarship, acknowledging our less than perfect past, and asking if we really walked the talk on our high aims. Might the Dalai Lama agree with the implicit self-critiques? He often cautions against the pursuit of prestige, for example. Yet this was not the direction he chose. Instead, he consistently reflected on the value of compassion. How to integrate service and scholarship? Compassion must be at the root. How to choose the kind of service to commit to? Develop compassion. Was a big salary against the rules of compassion? Not if you approached the results with compassion. By some accounts he did not always address what was asked, but the compass directing his answers was clear: your intentions matter, develop your heart, be honest with yourself, work very hard at these things, and let them direct your efforts. Such action, and this is indeed activity, must precede any external action of service for it to be genuine and sustainable. The real mover, he said, is love. When pushed on how such compassion is feasible even in the face of hatred and prejudice, he acknowledged that his moral strategy was decidedly hard work. From a Buddhist perspective it will take lifetimes to get it right. For all of his laughter and visible ease, the Dalai Lama is a serious man playing the long game. He has spent a lifetime studying texts on this very topic. He rises daily at 3:00 a.m. to meditate for three hours. His impossible goal, put forth through sacred vows, is to save all beings from suffering. But is it really possible, Prof. Eddie Glaude asked urgently. Professors were not born as professors, the Dalai Lama responded with a laugh. First they had to learn the alphabet, then to read and write. Now look at them!And how to convince the uninterested to engage in service? Some say it should be a requirement. The Dalai Lama suggested that motivating others was best done not through argument, law, or command, but through the trigger of one's affection for others. Affection, after all, can only be learned from one another. Affection is full in younger people, he surmised, but by the age of college, it can fade. It was like this that he implicitly challenged us, be it his implications that we haven't yet learned the alphabet when it comes to developing our hearts, or that if want to live differently we may sacrifice superficial things we hold dear. The Dalai Lama is a known master of upaya, skillful means, and while he can go toe to toe with world-class philosophers and neuroscientists, and has informed opinions on economic restructuring, his agenda was quietly calculated. As a scholar-monk he has often noted that American universities were adept at developing the mind, but not the heart. Even in service work, how often do we think seriously about developing our capacity for love? And unless we draw a correlation between academic excellence and kindheartedness, we can assume that the students, faculty, and staff at top tier schools are no more skilled at compassionate action than anyone else. The Dalai Lama talked about service in ways different from our leaders who highlight examples of exemplary action and quantifiable results. He drew attention instead to our intentions because he knows they need work. He was not satisfied with our engagement, and instead told us to redouble our efforts. Is there really a place for selfless work and internal development in the academy and our wider public? There must be if this aging monk, and the unprecedented positive response he receives wherever he goes, is any indication. For someone who has suffered the loss of his country yet remains serious about compassion, the Dalai Lama is downright likeable, happy, and goofy. He makes everyone around him smile. If care about service but dismiss this as unimportant, then we misunderstand the quiet enterprise of compassion, the humility it brings, its most serious challenge, and its value for all of us."

(If you are, rock on!) Sadly, I'm not. I wasn't blessed with the gift of heavy milk production. In fact, having heard so many successful nursing stories (Thank you, Gisele), I was frustrated when I couldn't produce overflowing bottles of ""liquid gold."" Instead of dreamily gazing at Baby #1, I was hunched over a whirring pump, screaming obscenities at my poorly-producing milkers. It didn't help that our daughter also had reflux and colic. I wasn't producing a lot of milk and she hated being horizontal. Awesome. Lesson #1: Do what's right for you.  With our first daughter my sanity was stretched thin. When I couldn't successfully nurse, I was depressed. I felt broken. I cursed motherhood. Was I the ONLY mom on the planet that couldn't participate in this sanctified tradition? Two weeks in I caved. (Actually my husband caved.) One evening I walked into the living room and he was feeding our baby a BOTTLE. OF. FORMULA. I gasped. I cried. I crumbled. What happened next surprised even me. I felt... RELIEF. Baby was devouring the bottle. She was happy. She was satiated. Kissing her forehead and watching in disbelief, I suddenly felt free. Free to nurture what would blossom into a beautiful bond. I thanked my husband for seeing what I couldn't see. Newly empowered, I felt the need to encourage other struggling moms to supplement. ""Why are you STILL nursing?"" I would question. ""Get on with your LIFE!"" I would cheer. Fast forward two years. With Baby #2 quickly approaching, friends cautiously asked my breastfeeding plans. Naturally I felt trepidation. Conjuring up images of a screaming baby, a poor latch and of course the pump that mocked me --""You arrre sooooore...You arrrre soooore"" -- clearly, I had baggage.Fortunately, Baby #2 wasn't colicky. When we laid her in her crib, she slept. When we put her down horizontally, she was fine. Talk about night and day! Even so, early on we learned that she had a milk allergy. To continue nursing, I would need to give up ALL foods containing dairy and soy. (That meant NO ice cream, no lattes, no milk chocolate!) After a couple weeks on the new diet, I almost gave up. She wasn't gaining as much weight as the pediatrician desired, I was spending too much time and effort (not to mention money) on the new diet and my support network urged me to stop. ""Why are you STILL nursing?"" They questioned. ""Get on with your LIFE!"" They chanted. So I considered quitting.  First birthdayBut I really REALLY wanted to nurse. I understood all the benefits for mom and baby. So I read. I listened to other moms' success stories. And I made the best decision ever. I contacted a lactation consultant -- Susan -- who ended up being a saint, at least in my eyes. Just a couple hours in Susan's office changed my outlook and confidence. Her consultation was equal parts art and science. She listened to our struggles, needs, and yes, baggage. She watched and corrected my technique. She weighed my daughter before and after nursing -- calculating just how much she drank. So I now knew that (1) I was making enough milk and (2) baby was consuming it. To someone stubborn (err... determined) it was exactly what I needed to hear. Susan also told me that I could call or text her 24 hours a day with any questions. Compare that to waiting hours to hear back from a pediatrician's office -- I was sold. I hugged Susan. I thanked her endlessly. And she kept her promise: over the next few months she answered every (and I mean every) inane question I had. Bless ""Saint"" Susan! Lesson #2: Find guidance.  If you want to try nursing, go for it! If you run into trouble, talk to other moms. Talk to the La Leche folks. Hire a lactation consultant. Sign up for a breastfeeding class.With my newly gained confidence and skills, I developed a very special relationship with Baby #2. We figured out nursing together. I learned her suckling patterns. She waited patiently for my letdown. With baby attached to me, I would lazily watch some trashy TV and devour my non-dairy ice cream (turns out almond is a great substitute). And I slowed down. I reflected. I finally understood what this whole nursing thing was all about. It IS beautiful. And yes, we do lose sleep, we do get sore, and it CAN be boring at times. But in the silence of my own thoughts I found peace. Through practice, we found our rhythm.  Lesson #3: Find your happy place. Happy mama equals happy baby. Keep a survival kit handy. In addition to the nursing pillow/glass of water/burp cloth, I kept my phone nearby. (Don't worry... I was fully in the moment. Promise.) I gazed so often at my baby I had a permanent crick in my neck. I loved seeing her eyelashes sprout overnight. I giggled when her little lips parted, indicating she was ""milk-drunk."" But wow, did I crave human contact, especially while on maternity leave. After the family had departed and visits slowed down, it became lonely -- especially in the wee hours of the night. My phone became a life support. I texted other moms to compare war stories. I made too many online purchases (you're welcome, Amazon). And I read hilarious articles like this one from Honest Toddler. Armed with the skills and confidence, I found nursing more natural (and fun) the second time around. Did I ever get to rockstar ""second freezer"" status? No. But I sure worked hard at it. Do I regret anything? No way. Each baby was different, each experience beautiful.   In the end, you just do what's right for you. From now on I vow to cheer on new moms with whatever their feeding decision is. Will you?"

Rick Perry answers questions during a news conference to discuss Texasâ Ebola prevention efforts, Friday, Oct. 17, 2014, in Austin, Texas. Perry has joined calls for an air travel ban from countries hit the hardest by Ebola. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dd1b240000510098f815.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A board of medical professionals appointed by Gov. Rick Perry said Wednesday that the state should provide health coverage to low-income Texans under the Affordable Care Act — a move the Republican-led Legislature has opposed. The 15-member Texas Institute of Health Care Quality and Efficiency recommended that the state’s health commissioner be authorized to negotiate a Texas-specific agreement with the federal government to expand health coverage to the poor, “using available federal funds.”“We’re trying to look at actions whereby more Texans can be covered,” said board chairman Steve Berkowitz, the president and founder 0f SMB Health Consulting. “We’re trying to take the politics out of it.”Under the Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s signature health law, the federal government has offered to foot more than 90 percent of the bill for states that expand their Medicaid programs to cover adults living in poverty. Perry and other Republican leaders have criticized the program, which could insure more than 1 million currently uncovered Texans, as inefficient.Lawmakers considered an alternative “Texas solution” to Medicaid expansion during the 2013 legislative session — an initiative that would have called on the state's health agency to seek a waiver from the federal government to draw down funds to cover the uninsured. That proposal failed. Ultimately the GOP-led Legislature approved a requirement that the Health and Human Services Commission receive legislative approval before expanding Medicaid eligibility — an effort to ensure that they held the keys to any possible agreement with the feds.Members of the Institute of Health Care Quality and Efficiency — which was established by lawmakers in the 2011 legislative session to identify evidence-based approaches to improving health care and cutting costs — said Wednesday that Texas’ rate of uninsured was “unacceptable,” and that state leaders should look for an alternative way to expand health coverage. The board's recommendations are not binding and any such decision is up to the Legislature. “We should be maximizing available federal funds through the Medicaid program to improve health care for all Texans,” said Joel Allison, a board member who is chief executive of the Baylor Scott & White Health System.

The National School Lunch Program is a federally assisted meal program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service operating in public, nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions. It provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to children each school day. USDA Photo by Bob Nichols.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5babe4b61f0000390122783a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Twenty-two years ago, just a few months after the L.A. riot, a radical nutritionist came to our staff meeting and preached about the effects of junk food on the students we were teaching. He said the chips and sodas went directly to their unformed brains and encouraged the bad decision-making that led them to gang membership, unprotected sex, drugs, violence, and the hopelessness that inspired them to drop out of school.We were a jaded bunch of teachers in that room so there was a lot of skepticism, but I've come to believe that there is at least some truth to what the dude was saying and have tried, whenever possible, to promote healthy eating to my students.Mostly I've done this by letting them bring their lunch to my room and eating my own relatively healthy bag lunch in front of them. Early on I discovered I needed extra food for students who didn't have enough to eat. I got them to like vegetables and appreciate fresh fruit. At times I've brought whole meals for kids to eat on a regular basis. As soon as you do that you realize that they will eat almost anything, however healthy, if it is made with care and comes from someone who gives a damn.Gangs still menace the streets of South Los Angeles. Violence, drug addiction, teenage pregnancy, and high levels of apathy still plague our students. Many more of them know about nutrition and healthy eating these days -- though most still eat chips and candy and drink soda all day (despite the fact that schools can no longer sell any of that) and consequently many of our students fade in the late morning and afternoon.In 2014 it isn't radical nutritionists calling on educators to promote healthy eating. The First Lady of the United States has revised the federal Title One dietary guidelines. Gone are the days of President Reagan's ketchup as a vegetable. And it is about time the feds try to do something to combat childhood obesity and promote healthy eating habits.Problem is, a lot of students aren't eating any of it. They say the federal food -- which at my school they call ""county"" -- is nasty, disgusting. They'll pick out what they consider edible and fill trash barrels with the rest.I thought perhaps this outright rejection of the newer, healthier lunches was a function of their age, that the high school students I teach are just too used to the junk food. But I've spoken to elementary teachers and they say the same. One teacher I met, who is from Alabama, told me she brings granola bars to work so the students won't be hungry after lunch.I don't think this is what Michelle Obama had in mind. Perhaps she didn't realize how this healthier food would actually be prepared or what it would ultimately taste like. Junk food is easily mass-produced. Food that is healthy, fresh, and flavorful is harder to make quickly and in large quantities.Perhaps even more significant is how we serve the food -- line students up, yell at them, herd them through and push trays into their chests. It is all too often the same manner in which we feed them the knowledge, skills, and understanding of their so-called education.Time to rethink how we feed our students -- food and otherwise -- before those trash barrels are overflowing with everything we've tried to give them."

(Photo by Giorgio Cosulich/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d9892b26000000325205a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the economic advantages that Poland has over its East-Central European neighbors is its relative decentralization. Hungary is completely dependent on Budapest just as Bulgaria leans heavily on Sofia and the Czech Republic on Prague. Poland has a number of major cities, including Krakow and Gdansk. Moreover, decentralization was a chief aim during the transition period. In March 1990, Poland passed the Local Self-Government Act to shift economic and political responsibilities to localities. As a World Bank study of the reforms points out, successful decentralization served not only to mobilize more people at a local level in the tasks of reconstruction but it also reduced the fiscal burden of the central government.Łowicz is a small city of around 26,000 people located about halfway between Warsaw and Lodz. It suffers from many of the economic problems that plague the rest of the country. Its population has dropped by more than 10 percent over the last two decades as young people in particular have left for Warsaw or for economic opportunity abroad. The area took a major economic hit during the economic upheavals of the 1990s. But a dairy cooperative survived and is now thriving. A second major firm, processing fruits and vegetables, also provides local jobs.""There was a third firm here in the Communist era called Syntex that produced socks, but it collapsed in 1995,"" the editor of the local newspaper, Wojciech Waligorski, told me in an interview in his office in August 2013. ""It was rebuilt with foreign capital, and it went bankrupt again in 2008 or so, I don't remember exactly. Instead of this one big factory, there are plenty of small sock-producing factories near Łowicz established by people who were working for this factory before. They have experience and money enough to establish their own enterprises. So there are at least 15 or 20 small producers near Łowicz and in Łowicz itself. So people can work there. A lot of them work also in very small private businesses. Some work in the public sector. A lot of them have their own trucks and work in international transport.""As Waligorski points out, jobs are still the number one concern of people in the area. And he doesn't think that the local government has done enough to attract capital to create jobs.""Kutno, a town 40 kilometers to the west of Łowicz, was hit much harder than Łowicz in this transition period,"" he explained. ""In Kutno there were a lot of industries of different kinds that went bankrupt, and the level of unemployment there was well above 20% in a certain period. But the local government there was able to buy land in large quantities at that time so that later they were able to offer investors big pieces of land. And now they are starting to get new investments. There are some factories from Italy, from Japan, and so on that have moved there. In Łowicz, the case is different. The town doesn't have a lot of land to offer. It's really a small town. The borders should be enlarged to have more possibilities to attract investments.""Still, he's happy with the political impact of local self-government. The citizens in Łowicz have a relatively high turnout in the elections, and local government has changed hands on several occasions.""Here in Łowicz itself, this self-government revolution in 1990 changed a lot,"" Waligorski concluded. ""This was a success overall in Poland. For me, a sign of whether democracy is healthy or ill is whether real change can happen. And in 1994, 1998, and 2006, we survived a real change. Completely different people took power here. That's proof of a healthy democracy. And it happens on the local political stage. It's not the case with national politics where Polish democracy is not as healthy as at the local level.""When we first met 23 years ago, Waligorski worked for a newspaper devoted to sobriety. He updated me on the state of alcoholism in Poland. We also talked about the impact of former Communist officials, the role of religion in Łowicz, and what people expect from a local newspaper.The InterviewWhat would you say are the major issues that people are interested in Łowicz? You told me that the size of your paper depends on the season and also on advertising. But I'm curious what articles have been most interesting to people, what has created controversy, and so on?  We are covering all kinds of stories concerning local life: local government, political quarrels in the local government, the local economy, social stories about interesting people living here, religious life, cultural life. We cover it all. Local sports. We have eight pages of sports, normally, so it's quite a lot. What people like most is finding something really interesting in our local life. Of course, crime is a hit on the first page. A man stabbed his wife in January. She was very known and he was very known because they had a hairdresser's salon. So of course people like things like this. That's obvious everywhere in the world. But I cannot precisely say what makes our newspaper interesting. I think the key is that we cover everything, but only local things. We really do not write anything about what's taking place in Warsaw or in Łódź or even in Skierniewice. The key to success is covering only local things.Once we conducted a survey, but the results of the survey haven't been confirmed. But we did confirm our suspicions that there are people who are looking in the newspaper for local sports, there are people who are looking for obituaries, there are people who are looking for local government affairs, there are people looking for stories about people living here, there are people looking for well-written big stories about the economy. So, really, there's no one topic that is the most interesting. Everything here in Łowicz is interesting for them.But the one constant for people living here is that they are really worried about joblessness. It's not joblessness as such because the level of unemployment here is about 10% or even less. As a matter of fact, it's lower because many people are working in the gray market. So it's not a tragedy here. But people have this belief that the town isn't developing as they would like it to be, that they are forced to look for work somewhere else - for example, in Warsaw. There are really a lot of people commuting to Warsaw to work. So, that's the constant concern for people here: how to find a good job.  Are there possibilities of new factories or new investment coming to Łowicz? Is that something that the local government is actively trying to bring to Łowicz?  Yes, they are trying, but I do not think they are successful in this area. For example, Kutno, a town 40 kilometers to the west of Łowicz, was hit much harder than Łowicz in this transition period. In Kutno there were a lot of industries of different kinds that went bankrupt, and the level of unemployment there was well above 20% in a certain period. But the local government there was able to buy land in large quantities at that time so that later they were able to offer investors big pieces of land. And now they are starting to get new investments. There are some factories from Italy, from Japan, and so on that have moved there. In Łowicz, the case is different. The town doesn't have a lot of land to offer. It's really a small town. The borders should be enlarged to have more possibilities to attract investments.Two weeks ago -- I wasn't here since I was in the mountains at the time -- but my journalists wrote an article about it. The Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to Łowicz just to open officially not a factory but a branch office - the headquarters are in Warsaw -- for exploration of shale gas. American capital is involved in this company. It's called United Oil Field Services, and they have established their center here. It's well organized with a lot of special equipment, with laboratories, electronic devices, and so on. But it's only a branch office, a base for working everywhere in Poland. It's something. Some people will get a job here. It's a success for local government to attract this company here. But as a whole, I would say Łowicz is not coping very well with economic problems.  How do you evaluate the competence of local officials?  It's not so bad. Many different parties have governed the city over the last 23 years. Some of the mayors and officials were okay. The scale and the kind of problems that we had to cope with were quite different at the beginning of the 1990s. It has changed a lot.Now since 2006, there's a mayor who has won two terms. He's quite popular. He's really listening to the will of the people and really trying to solve people's problems. I appreciate his kind of engagement. But in terms of attracting outside investment, he does not have good competence or had good achievements. It could have been much better. It has to be much better. He's popular and independent. During his first election in 2006, he was supported by both Law and Order Party (PiS) and Civic Platform (PO) voters. His citizen's committee has a majority on the town council. I think he's going to win a third term, though it's not certain. He won his first term in a landslide with 75% of the votes. The second time was not much worse because it was close to 70%. That means something. We can say it's a good transparent democracy in Poland now - at least on the local level. As journalists, we really haven't found anything to object to.  No corruption?To read the rest of the interview, click here."

Mujica, known to many Uruguayans simply by his nickname ""Pepe,"" promised to consider the offer.Months later, Mexico's Ambassador to Uruguay Felipe Enriquez Hernandez told Mujica the car would fetch the price of 10 four-wheel-drive trucks at auction.For now, it would seem Mujica's head is not for turning.""I don't know if one day the Beetle will go,"" Mujica said.
