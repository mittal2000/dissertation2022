""It's more complex being in a larger area where you're crossing over states and different jurisdictions, but everyone has been fantastic.""Despite earlier expectations for bitter cold and possible snow at the 48th Super Bowl, Sunday brought mild temperatures, with a forecast high of 48 degrees Fahrenheit (9 degrees Celsius), with lows expected to drop to just about freezing. The National Weather Service warned there was a chance of rain.Online ticket resellers showed seats starting at about $1,600 and rising above $2,000, up from opening prices of about $1,300 a week earlier. BOOST FOR NEW JERSEYWhile much of the focus has been on New York, where a 3/4-mile (1.2 km) stretch of taken over by a four-day street fair where fans could try to kick a field goal, get a player's autograph or ride a 60-foot-high (18-meter-high) toboggan slide, the game has also been a boost to New Jersey.The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos both stayed in Jersey City, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, and fans could be seen roaming near the hotels the teams had taken over, trying to catch a glimpse of the players.Troy Maragos, a 29-year-old pastor from Chicago, opted to spend a few nights in that city of 254,441 people ahead of the game.""I'm impressed by how clean everything is,"" Maragos said as he boarded a train. ""The subway system is great, it's been nice that it's so easy to get back and forth from New York.""Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said having both teams stay had been a boost for local businesses.""From an economic point of view, we won't have the full sense of it until sometime after the Super Bowl, but the restaurants are more full than usual, there are fans visiting here,"" Fulop said. ""It's going to be a benefit to New York, it's going to be a benefit to New Jersey, it's going to benefit the whole region.""READY FOR IT TO BE OVEREven as the estimated 400,000 people who are believed to have traveled into the region for the game and related events geared up for kickoff, some New Yorkers were looking forward to seeing the crowds thin out on Monday.At a United Parcel Service Inc store on Broadway that faced the Super Bowl Boulevard street fair, Mello Smith complained that the crowds slowed things down.""This is hard for the customers, too,"" Smith said. ""They are complaining. They want their deliveries or they want to drop off, and it's a hassle.""Likewise, Dustin Drankoski, a 27-year-old a photo editor, said the added crowds in an already congested area of Manhattan had made his commute to his office near Times Square even more difficult.""The real annoyance is all the tourists and the lines of people,"" Drankoski said. ""There are lines of people in the subway station waiting to go through the stalls and they don't know how to use their MetroCards, so you just have to wait,"" he said. ""The people who are really impacted are the drivers. There's no way to get around this area."" (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Nick Zieminski)"

Lee/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dcab925000035003698a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With its bodies nearly as big as its tackles, football might be the sport with the most obvious connection to food. But whereas the emphasis was once on eating to increase the size of an offensive lineman, balanced meals and performance-based nutrition have now risen to the forefront.We chatted recently with Susan M. Kleiner, Ph.D., RD, a nutrition consultant for the Seattle Seahawks and a former full-time nutritionists for the ""original"" Cleveland Browns, about what it takes to feed and fuel the NFL's top dogs. What was the attitude toward nutrition like in the early 1990s when you started working with NFL players? What was changing in pro sports was the beginning of drug testing, frankly. People were looking for alternatives. I was very involved in nutritional alternatives to drug use -- that was my doctoral research -- and it was a big part of what I was doing in the early days of the field of sports nutrition. I worked with the ""original"" Cleveland Browns in 1991, 1992, that time. After several years I moved to Seattle and did some work with individual Seahawks players, including Matt Hasselbeck.What types of questions or nutrition concerns did players have when you started? Back then, the big impetus was just to be big and weigh a lot. Bill Belichick [then with the Browns] was at the forefront of looking at body composition and trying to enhance lean body mass and muscle mass without having players be over-fat. At that time, there were tremendously gifted players who actually could move around at these very high weights. It was the beginning of a shift away from getting as many calories as we can possibly get in -- pounds and pounds of meat, whole milk, a dozen eggs -- but to eat healthy. We began to understand the risks of heart disease in these athletes, which was motivation to find healthier diets, healthier fats, getting in the whole grainsEating a loaf of white bread was not a good strategy. Eating a dozen raw eggs in a milkshake, not a good strategy. But that's what athletes were doing.We didn't have meal replacement drinks at that time, so I created what we called Kleiner's Muscle-Building Formula, which was instant breakfast powder with milk, peanut butter and banana. We were learning about utilizing carbohydrate and protein together and the power that had for promoting muscle protein synthesis and diminishing muscle protein breakdown. We started to understand inflammation in those early days and really increase fruits and vegetables. I understood at that time how important fish was, and I was probably the first to emphasis five fish meals a week in the NFL. There was a lot of experimentation, with the goal being, can we lower drug use and make people healthier?What does a typical daily meal plan look like for an NFL player? Of course it depends on the player and the position, and his size and natural metabolism. Some need far more calories than others. My overall experience has been that a quarterback needs a minimum of 4,000 calories a day and up to 6,000 calories a day, depending on where they are in their training, in the season, and how quickly they gain or lose weight.The typical day starts with as much breakfast as we can get in, consisting typically of some kind of hearty whole-grain cereal, eggs, maybe a whole-grain toast, flax seeds, whole fruit. On many teams they're getting lots of sautéed vegetables with omelets or eggs in the morning. Depending on the team and the time of the year, they may be fed by the team or on their own at home for breakfast, but most teams have good nutritionists now or sports dietitians pushing vegetables early in the morning to try and get those in. We don't see the old donuts and danishes that we used to see. There may be starches like yams and potatoes and dairy like yogurt, but there is quite a bit of lactose intolerance with the players. The early morning meal can be pretty big, since they're usually sitting in the morning watching films.Before they exercise they may need some kind of shake or pre-exercise snack of around 300 calories that combines protein and carbohydrate. It's not going to have a lot of fat because they're going to go out and play. During their workout, depending on their calorie needs, they might use sports drinks or sports drink mixed with water.For lunch there is often a range of roasted or broiled meats. There may be things like burritos. There will very often be vegetarian protein options, like beans. Athletes will usually be careful about what they can and can't manage because they know personally how they digest before going into their afternoon training. There's always a big salad bar, always a lot of vegetables, there's almost always a big fruit bar. There are lots of bread and wrap options for sandwiches. We're seeing fewer and fewer foods that are high in added sugars and saturated fats.The players are on their own for dinner, which is again pretty robust. We work on having them eat at least six times a day, if not more. Dinner will often have some kind of hearty protein and vegetable and grain. The heavy carbs at night may not be there. Ideally, I encourage getting in as much carbohydrate around training as possible so they're putting their food to work for them. At night, there isn't that heavy emphasis on carbs and then going to sleep, which is what used to happen. That's one trick to limit fat accumulation.Are these changes in the attitude toward nutrition rubbing off on the players, or just coming as directives from the coaching staff? It's a huge change over the years from when I started. When I began, it was the retired athletes who were worried about their nutrition. They weren't training in the same way anymore, but they weren't eating differently. They gained a lot of weight, and they were at tremendous risk for heart disease and stroke. Today, many of the young players take nutrition in college as part of their health and fitness education as they go through the athletic department. There are many players who come from schools who had sports nutritionists who worked with the team. They're coming in with an education. Most of them understand that it will make a difference in their performance and even more probably understand it's going to make a difference in the length of their playing life. And that translates to dollars for them.Today, so many of the elite players are all working with nutritionists. When a young player has a role model, they want to know what that guy is doing. Most are trying at least to change their diets. I think the owners are even starting to notice that the teams that focus on nutrition do better in the long run. When I worked with Coach Belichick, who has gone on to have quite a career, he had incredible attention to detail. His motto was that the difference between any player and a champion at the level of NFL play where people are already selected out for being the most gifted, the hardest working, the most well trained, the difference is going to be attention to detail. I never think of nutrition as a detail. At that level it's just a critical piece, a very important factor among many important factors. You can't not pay attention to anything, because the champions pay attention to everything.As told to Sarah Klein. This interview has been edited and condensed."
11,TRAVEL,Legal Weed Causing Sky-High Travel Demand To Denver,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/legal-weed-causing-skyhig_us_5b9dd056e4b03a1dcc8d2e51,"""The origins that had the biggest increases cluster are in the Midwest and the South -- places like Minneapolis, Indianapolis",2014-02-01,"Partygoers smoke marijuana, left, and cigarettes during a Prohibition-era themed New Year's Eve party celebrating the start of retail pot sales, at a bar in Denver, late Tuesday Dec. 31, 2013. Colorado is to begin marijuana retail sales on Jan. 1, a day some are calling ?Green Wednesday.' (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dd0563c000032000a4b0e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Denver, Colo. is a well-known tourist destination -- its close proximity to some of the most beautiful mountains in the world make the Mile High City an obvious winter vacation choice. But there's a new high that appears to have captured some tourists' interest in the city: the state's newly legalized recreational marijuana.A recent study from travel planning engine Hopper.com, suggests just that -- people from around the U.S. are searching for flights to Denver much more than they used to and the spike began just as the state's new retail marijuana laws went into effect on Jan. 1. The perceived demand in travel to Denver is represented by the number of search queries by travelers, not by actual ticket purchases. Hopper's data shows that flight search demand for Denver as a destination has been up at least 10 percent for each of the first three weeks of January, peaking at a 14 percent increase during the first week of the new year. Last year, during the same period, flight search demand to Denver tracked at or below the national average.""We can never say categorically about what's causing the surge in Denver interest among travelers,"" Hopper's chief data scientist, Patrick Surry told The Huffington Post. ""But what we can do is we can look at what the patterns are in the data and how those stack up against other theories."" Surry looked at two major factors in ruling out other popular reasons to seek Denver out as a destination since the legalization of marijuana: Broncos football games and skiing, both a draw to Denver in the early months of the year. But Surry said that in both of the Broncos' playoff opponents' cities -- Boston and San Diego -- neither showed above average demand for Denver flights and could be likely ruled out as a major factor.In order to rule out skiing as a major factor that could lead to more travel searches for Denver, Surry looked at similar destination airports in Albuquerque, N.M., Salt Lake City, Ut., and Jackson Hole, Wyo. for their trends. Like Denver, Albuquerque had similar demands to the Mile High City last year but the ski-centric Jackson Hole area had an increase in demand for winter, but starting earlier in November and December, not a sudden rush on January 1. The interest in flights to Denver appears to also correlate with stricter drug laws in other regions in the U.S.""The origins that had the biggest increases cluster are in the Midwest and the South -- places like Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Omaha, Kansas City, Nashville and then you have Houston and Tampa,"" Surry said. Places like Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas and Florida -- where Surry saw an increase in interest to travel to Denver -- do not have any laws legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational use. ""The largest increase was actually from Nashville,"" Surry said. ""It was 63 percent over what was going on nationwide -- and then Minneapolis was second largest."" Minnesota and Nebraska both have marijuana decriminalization laws on the books, but nothing close to the broad legalization that Colorado now enjoys. ""None of the states that already have medical use or recreational use seem to be in the top ten in flight searches to Denver,"" Surry said. On New Years Day, dispensaries in Colorado became the first in the U.S. to legally sell recreational marijuana to adults 21-and-over leading to sales of over $5 million in just the first week alone.""The news media made a big deal this year, there was a huge amount of coverage and from my perspective a lot of this is speculative demand of people saying 'Hey, that sounds interesting, what would it take for me to get there,'"" Surry added. ""So it makes sense that we'd see this increased interest in the possibility of flying there."""

It's not really like that,"" he said. ""I will have paid my ex-wife, I think it is $23 or $24 million. That's an awful lot of money. And when you have to pay it over a period of seven years, even if you sell a lot of properties -- like I had five and I now have one -- there's still a lot of simple, hard work to be done just to earn the rest of it."" Cleese divorced psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger in 2008 after 16 years of marriage. The couple's 2009 divorce settlement reportedly stipulated that Cleese pay Eichelberger, his third ex-wife, $13 million in cash and assets  and nearly $1 million a year until 2016.
