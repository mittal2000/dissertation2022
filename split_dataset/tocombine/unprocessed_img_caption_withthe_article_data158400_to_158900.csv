0,HOME & LIVING,How To Spring Clean Your Washer And Dryer,"Steve Ash, Contributor
Senior Repairman",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spring-clean-washer-dryer_us_5b9d0582e4b03a1dcc83cec7,Follow these spring cleaning tips to avoid major laundry room mishaps.,2013-04-08,Luxury laundry room with wood cabinets and tile floor.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d05822500003600364bcd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you plan on taking part in the annual ritual of spring cleaning, we've got some advice on how to clean two of your hardest working appliances: the washer and dryer. In addition to looking nice, clean appliances generally run more efficiently, helping to save money on your electric bill and prevent safety issues, like dryer fires. If it's been a while since you've shown yours some love, read on to learn tips on how to get them looking and running their best.WasherTop Loading Washers Detergent and fabric softener residue can build up in the dispensers, so remove them and wash them with warm soapy water. While you are cleaning the dispensers, fill the empty washing machine with hot water, add one cup of bleach, letting it sit for an hour before running a long cleaning cycle. After the cycle is finished, refill the appliance with hot water and this time add one to two cups of vinegar before running it through another cycle. Finally, run a hot water cycle one more time to thoroughly clean the washing machine. Because you've used bleach, it's best to have the first load of clothes be whites, in case there are traces of the product remaining in the washer. Front Loading Washers A common complaint among owners of front loading, high efficiency washers is that clothes and the washer tub can take on a musty, moldy odor. This can happen when dirt, grime and water get into the folds of the door's seal. If yours is a bit smelly, in addition to the cleaning tips mentioned above, thoroughly clean the door seal with a bleach solution (one part bleach to nine parts water). Use a toothbrush or other small cleaning tool to get in all of the nooks and crannies, where mold can grow. To prevent this from reoccurring, never leave wet clothes in the machine overnight, keep the washer door open when the machine is not in use and wipe down the seal with a mild cleanser on a weekly basis. DryerIn addition to cleaning out the lint trap after each load of laundry every three to four months, remove the lint trap and use the nozzle attachment of your vacuum to suck out any dirt that might have made its way into the body of the dryer. To prevent lint from getting into the dryer, when replacing the trap, make sure it fits snuggly and that there are no tears in the screen. Using a rag, wipe down the inside of the dryer drum with a mild detergent or vinegar. And if you have an automatic drying setting, give the moisture sensor electrodes a good cleaning. The moisture sensor detects when the clothes are dry, but buildup from lint or dryer sheets can affect the sensor, leaving you with overly dried clothes, or clothes that are still wet. While cleaning your dryer, it's a great time to tackle the dryer exhaust. The exhaust should be cleaned annually to avoid an excess build up of lint, which can become a fire hazard. To clean the exhaust, find and loosen the clamp, and remove the exhaust off the back of the dryer. Use your hands to remove the lint you can reach from the exhaust tubes, then take a clothes hanger to remove the clumps that you can't reach. Finally vacuum any lint remaining in the exhaust and in the back of the dryer, before reattaching the exhaust.Washer & DryerOnce you've cleaned the inside of both machines, take some time to spruce up the outside too. If your appliances have a painted finish, you can wipe them down with a multipurpose cleaner and tackle any tough stains and scuff marks with a magic eraser. If your washer and dryer have a stainless steel finish, get rid of the dirt and grime by using a gentle detergent and then use a glass cleaning spray to get rid of finger prints, making sure to dry the appliances really well to prevent streaks. Now that the washer and dryer are cared for, they can get back to their duty of helping you with your other spring cleaning projects! Click through our slideshow to see more helpful tips.

People reported that Funicello was in a coma, and had been on life support before she died. ""She's on her toes dancing in heaven. No more MS,"" her daughter, Gina Gilardi, told Extra, as reported by People magazine. ""My brothers and I were there, holding her sweet hands when she left us."" The Los Angeles Times reported that Funicello was originally diagnosed with MS in 1987. People reported that she first started experiencing symptoms of MS when she was filming ""Back to the Beach."" In 1992, Funicello finally announced her diagnosis to the public. Multiple sclerosis is a condition where the body's immune system attacks the myelin sheath, which protects nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord, according to the National Institutes of Health. More than 2.1 million people around the world have multiple sclerosis, and the condition can begin at virtually any age -- the National Multiple Sclerosis Society said that it's been seen from ages 2 to 75. However, it's usually diagnosed when a person is between ages 20 and 50. Multiple sclerosis won't necessarily make a person's life shorter, but it can affect the quality of life through its symptoms, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Symptoms are not the same from person to person; they can be mild in one person, and severe in another. But generally, they include fatigue, tremors, muscle stiffness, numbness or pain, depression, bladder issues, weakness, vision problems, memory problems and sensitivity to heat, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. There is no cure for multiple sclerosis, and the only treatments available are meant to slow the progression of the disease and to manage symptoms, the Mayo Clinic reported. Funicello's exact complications from multiple sclerosis were not reported, but common complications include epilepsy, depression, memory problems, paralysis, muscle spasms and bladder or bowel problems, according to the Mayo Clinic."

3,IMPACT,WWE Works to End Bullying at WrestleMania 29,"Alicia Jessop, Contributor

AFP PHOTO/ TIMOTHY A. CLARY (Photo credit should read TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1a9011f0000df00235ae9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Standing at 6'7"" and 375 lbs, it's hard to imagine that anyone would find it in them to bully WWE superstar Brodus Clay. As school-aged kids across the United States are learning, though, Clay fell victim to bullying during his childhood. ""I'm bi-racial and was a big kid who moved around a lot. I was poor growing up, so I didn't have Nike's and things like that. I got into a lot of fights and was easily provoked,"" Clay said. In third grade, Clay grew beyond bullying through the help of a teacher who reached out to the budding wrestling star. ""A teacher who I initially couldn't stand worked with me about expressing my feelings and taught me how to use skills in those situations. I was lucky that I had someone who took the time to teach me how to relax,"" Clay noted.These days, WWE has given Clay the chance to pay the lesson his third grade teacher taught him forward. Two years ago, WWE partnered with The Creative Coalition to launch the ""Be a STAR"" program, where ""STAR"" stands for ""show tolerance and respect."" Through the program, WWE provides a free anti-bullying curriculum to teachers nationwide. Additionally, WWE superstars and divas travel the country hosting numerous anti-bullying speaking events at schools throughout the year. Clay points out that hearing an anti-bullying message from the wrestlers they look up to is an important tool in getting kids to stop bullying one another. ""In most of the WWE stories I saw growing up, the villains would bully the good guy. Eventually, though, the good guy would win. WWE was important to me as a kid, because it was there every week with those messages. WWE always preached the message of standing up and being accountable.""WWE's ""Be a STAR"" program is just one of the many philanthropic efforts the professional wrestling promotion company engages in. Throughout his tenure as WWE CEO, Vince McMahon has made charitable giving and philanthropic projects cornerstones of the WWE business model. ""Giving back to the community has always been part of the company's DNA. Since we're in different cities 52 weeks out of the year, Vince wanted to give back. We see it not just about giving back, but about making our fans feel stronger about causes that matter to them,"" said WWE's chief marketing officer, Michelle Wilson. Over the years, WWE has invested over millions of dollars in charitable projects. Today, its charitable mission focuses upon four areas: diversity and inclusion; education; the military and providing hope, wishes and dreams. In choosing the areas to focus upon, the McMahon's weigh their interests equally with those of the millions of WWE fans. ""The McMahon's initially had an interest in education as a priority and making that part of their community outreach. However, Vince weighs in on anything our fans are interested in,"" Wilson said. Personal and fan motivation led McMahon and WWE to launch the ""Be a STAR"" program. According to Wilson, ""When we look at community outreach, we talk to our fans to see what issues are top of mind for them. Because 40 percent of our audience is women and 25 percent are kids under the age of 17, bullying came up as a global epidemic that parents and kids are struggling over what they can do to stop it."" Wilson then pitched the idea of using WWE as a intermediary to ending bullying. ""A light bulb went off for me and I realized that bullying is an issue we can get around. With WWE, we have a global entertainment platform we can get the message out with and athletes kids really look up to. If we develop the right kind of program with partners, I thought we could really make a difference in ending bullying. Taking the idea to McMahon, Wilson was pleased with the result. ""Vince has six grandchildren now. When I told him the statistics about bullying, he thought we had to do something about it,"" Wilson explained.As WWE hosts WrestleMania 29, its commitment is stronger than ever. While charitable events have been held every WrestleMania weekend since WrestleMania 1, the breadth of events has grown significantly. This year's events includes not only ""Be a STAR"" rallies, but also hospital visits, reading celebrations, special recognition of military professionals, a fundraiser for Hurricane Sandy relief, and the granting of wishes for twenty Make-A-Wish families. For WWE and its superstars, these events define their existence. ""I think it's a responsibility of any role model to give back,"" Clay said.Alicia Jessop is a Colorado-based attorney and the founder of the sports law website RulingSports.com.

""There is, however, a limit to how effectively monetary policy can continue to shoulder the lion's share of this effort.""Central banks still need to heed broken balance sheets that impede lending and plan for and guard against uncertainties arising from any policy change, the IMF chief said.Japan stunned investors on Thursday by unleashing the world's most intense burst of monetary stimulus, which will pump $1.4 trillion into its economy in under two years. It hopes the shock therapy will end two decades of stagnation.But the move is a huge gamble. It heavily exposes the BoJ to Japan's mountain of public debt and carries the potential for big losses if inflation spikes and investors lose faith in its viability.Japan's government debt, at twice the size of its $5 trillion economy, is proportionally the highest among developed nations.Lagarde said fiscal problems in developed nations such as Japan and the United States marred the global economic recovery and contrasted with emerging economies, where a broadening rebound is brightening the outlook. ENVIABLELagarde said the IMF expected Asian economies to grow by nearly 6 percent this year, ""an enviable performance by any measure"", as resilient domestic demand and accommodative policies power the region.She said the impressive growth rate is customary for Asia, which has accounted for two-thirds of global growth in the last five years since the financial crisis struck.Asia's buoyancy has rubbed off on the rest of the world.""A substantial portion of the global economy looks better today than it did last year,"" Lagarde said. ""And we are beginning to see momentum pick up in the United States.""In the euro zone, however, she said debt problems are weighing on growth and dragging out a recession.Lagarde said the main task for the currency zone right now is to push for a banking union, a plan that is meant to put an end to the euro zone's debt troubles by severing the link between sovereign borrowers and banks.Last month, however, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said European aid for troubled banks is a last resort, which raised doubts about the plan for a banking union.Dijsselbloem made the comments after a rescue programme was agreed for Cyprus that imposed steep losses on depositors, leading to suggestions that the Cypriot deal could serve as a precedent for future bank bailouts in the bloc.Lagarde said Cyprus was not a model for the rest but that the pecking order for investors to absorb losses including depositors must be respected.""When a financial institution goes under, a resolution process has to take place that will constantly be shouldered by taxpayers, either in the country or in the region or in the world,"" she said."

But if he's right, is it the technology itself, or the large corporations that install it?The claim that new technology destroys jobs is at least as old as the industrial revolution; it's always been met with the counterclaim that new technology creates jobs too. And after all, the growth of any modern economy depends on adopting ever more labor-saving technology. Is something different this time? If so, what? Here's what McAfee says:About 30 years ago, wage growth for the average American worker started to taper off. And for the past 15 years, it's actually been negative. About 12 years ago, job growth started to taper off as well. Of course, that took a huge dive during the great recession and has really not recovered at all.McAfee unwittingly drops a clue in this statement. What happened 30 years ago? The Reagan Revolution, that's what. In the name of creating a ""free market,"" the Revolution created exactly the opposite. By cutting taxes on the rich and on corporations while raising payroll taxes, the Revolution tipped the policy balance in favor of the one percent and against small business. By cutting regulation and anti-trust enforcement, the revolution set off a wave of mergers and takeovers unparalleled since the era of robber barons. Mergers that would have seemed unthinkable even a decade ago -- such as the new combination of U.S. Airways and American Airlines or Comcast and NBC (2009-11) -- happen without more than a peep from the Justice Department. And in the crisis of 2008, the government not only bailed out the culprit banks, but officiated at a series of shotgun marriages -- as between Wachovia and Wells Fargo; or Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Countrywide -- that left us with a handful of Even-Too-Bigger-to-Fail banks.But what's the Reagan revolution have to do with new labor-saving technology and employment? Quite simply, big corporations, especially big monopolistic corporations, tend to carry labor-saving technology too far. They automate too soon and too much. The reasons are pretty obvious once you think about it. First, the bigger an organization, the greater the management bottleneck, that is, the more difficult it becomes for top management to keep track of lower levels. There could be no better example than the story of how the risky trades of the ""London Whale"" blindsided Jamie Dimon and cost JP Morgan billions. So managers of big corporations understandably seek to replace fallible or potentially dishonest employees with machines. Second, big corporations, awash in cash, can easily afford to automate. Third, there's the ""gee whiz"" factor -- the temptation to automate even if it's not cost-effective, because the new technology is so cool and the CEO wants to appear to be ""with it.""As a consequence, large corporations hire far fewer employees per dollar of sales or assets than do small businesses -- the true ""job creators."" For example, according to 2007 Census data, comparing firms with under half a million in sales to those with over $100 million, the small firms averaged 15 employees per $100 million sales while the big ones averaged only three. The greater the share of the economy that large corporations control, the more their labor-saving propensities put the squeeze on workers.So yes, new technology is indeed destroying jobs. But in focusing on technology rather than the corporations that install it, scientists like McAfee ignore the elephant in the room: the growing concentration of wealth and corporate power."

Aereo is one of several startups created to deliver traditional media over the Internet without licensing agreements. Past efforts have typically been rejected by courts as copyright violations. In Aereos case, the judge accepted the companys legal reasoning, but with reluctance. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb363b12200005700dbe00f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Liana B. Baker and Ronald Grover(Reuters) - Two fledgling technologies could dramatically reshape the $60 billion-a-year television broadcast industry as they challenge the business model that has helped keep broadcasters on the lucrative end of the media spectrum.On April 1, a U.S. appeals court rejected a petition by the major broadcasters including Comcast's NBC, News Corp's FOX, Disney's ABC and CBS, to stop a service called Aereo, which offers a cut-rate TV subscription for consumers by capturing broadcast signals over thousands of antennas at one time.It was the second time in recent months that TV broadcasters failed to block a new technology that undercuts revenue they generate for their television shows.In November, a California court struck down Fox's request to ban Dish Network's ad-eliminating video recording device called the Hopper.The two services strike at the heart of the TV broadcast model, whose future will be up for debate at the National Association of Broadcasters show, which 90,000 people were expected to attend in Las Vegas this week.The most touted feature of the Hopper makes TV commercials disappear completely when watching recorded prime-time broadcast television, unlike prior DVRs and other devices that require the viewer to fast forward through ads.Aereo could cut the numbers of people who need or want a more expensive cable video subscription, which would eat into the $3 billion in so-called ""retransmission fees"" that research firm SNL Kagan says broadcasters get from cable and satellite systems, based on the number of their subscribers.The threat so far is limited. The number of people using Aereo - backed by media heavyweight Barry Diller, who launched the Fox network in 1986 - is miniscule compared to the number of pay TV customers in the United States. Dish's Hopper is a more mainstream device that Dish's 14 million subscribers have access to.But broadcasters fear the services will continue to expand, cutting into their viewing audience and advertising revenue.Even though courts have made preliminary decisions in favor of Dish and Aereo, both cases are still in the early stages and those decisions could ultimately be reversed.FORCING CHANGEA favorable outcome for Aereo and the Hopper in court would push TV operators to dramatically reshape themselves. It could even force them to trade in their broadcast towers and become cable channels alongside networks such as Bravo, AMC and ESPN, says Garth Ancier, who has been the top TV programmer at Fox, NBC and the WB networks.""They won't have a choice,"" Ancier said. ""When someone attacks your business, sometimes you do something radical.""Some of the top four major networks have been considering just such a move for months, and the emergence of the two technology threats could accelerate their decisions, according to Ancier.That would keep the broadcasters' signals away from Aereo and their ads free from the Hopper, which for now only zaps broadcast ads in recorded television.The downside? Broadcasters would have to turn their backs on the 11.1 million homes that Nielsen estimates still receives their TV signals from rabbit ears and rooftop antennas and do not have cable subscriptions.Spokesmen for Fox, CBS, NBC and ABC declined to comment on their plans. Last week, following the Aereo ruling, Fox said ""the court has ruled that it is OK to steal copyrighted material and retransmit it without compensation.""All the broadcasters also said they plan to keep fighting Aereo and said they were confident that the rights of content owners would be protected.NEW VIEWING HABITSBoth the Hopper and Aereo take advantage of changes in how TV viewers get their shows. Increasing numbers are ""binge watching,"" or tuning into libraries of recorded episodes on their DVRs or on the Internet. As many as 5 million homes now ""cut the cord"" and get their TV shows from sources such as streaming on the Internet or watching DVDs or game consoles, according to a March 11 Nielsen study.For now, the number of people using either the Hopper or Aereo is small but growing.The Hopper is the free DVR for new Dish customers and is the focus of Dish's current ad campaigns. Dish has 14 million customers, making it one of the biggest U.S. pay TV companies behind Comcast and DirecTV, the company says.Aereo has never revealed its subscriber numbers but it is expanding quickly. In February, Aereo said it was available to 19 million people, mostly in the New York area, and it embarked on an outdoor advertising campaign. It plans to expand to 22 other cities this year including major markets such as Chicago and Houston.Even before Aereo and the Hopper appeared, the percentage of viewers who watch TV from the traditional networks was crashing, down from 69 percent in 1993 to 42 percent today in February, according to Nielsen.A further jolt to the broadcasters' dwindling audience would empower advertisers, who last year spent $27 billion on broadcasting commercials, to negotiate tougher on price hikes and could take some of that money elsewhere.Just as troubling for the broadcasters, if ratings continue to decline, the TV networks will have smaller captive audience to whom they can promote their new programming slate, which would likely accelerate the downward cycle.""It's like the music business,"" said BTIG media analyst Rich Greenfield. ""They decline and decline and one day the bottom falls out.""The networks might fight back. CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves told an investor conference last fall that he may pull CBS off the Dish's system, depriving the service's subscribers of NFL football and ""CSI"" if the satellite operator continued to promote the Hopper's commercial skipping feature.On March 26, CBS said it acquired a 50 percent stake in the cable channel TVGN, formerly the TV Guide Network, adding a cable channel that would be safe from Aereo.TVGN and its fellow cable channels are so far safe from the Hopper. Dish's chairman Charlie Ergen said in February that Dish does not yet have the technology to zap commercials on cable and the company has not announced any intention to do so.Broadcasters still hope to cut off both services by persuading the courts that they violate copyright laws and breach contracts.For now, Aero and the Hopper will only get more popular as the cases wind their way through court, said intellectual property attorney Andrew Goldstein, a partner with the Chicago firm of Freeborn & Peters.""It will be hard to put that genie back in the bottle,"" Goldstein said.(Reporting By Liana B.

Ebert's review, which was posted on Mar. 27, was a fairly negative one, giving the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. Ebert did, however, find some greater meaning in the film, as he wrote: Soul Melanie (known as Wanderer) falls in love with Earth Melanie, even though in theory this isn't possible because the Wanderer has become Melanie. This intimate form of self-love leads to dialogue that will possibly be found humorous by some people. When Wanda is about to kiss the boy she loves, for example, the film uses voiceover to warn her: ""No, Melanie! Wrong! No! He's from another planet!""The Sun-Times has since published Ebert's review for ""To The Wonder,"" the last review he wrote before his death on Thursday. A drama starring Ben Affleck and Olga Kurylenko, ""To The Wonder"" tells the story of a rocky relationship between an American man and a European woman. Published on Saturday, The Sun-Times noted, ""The following is the last review written by Roger Ebert. Appropriately it’s a review of a film by a director Mr. Ebert held in great esteem: Terrence Malick.""Ebert, who died at the age of 70, awarded ""To The Wonder"" 3.5 stars, penning a generally favorable review: As the film opened, I wondered if I was missing something. As it continued, I realized many films could miss a great deal. Although he uses established stars, Malick employs them in the sense that the French director Robert Bresson intended when he called actors “models.” Ben Affleck here isn’t the star of “Argo” but a man, often silent, intoxicated by love and then by loss. Bardem, as a priest far from home, made me realize as never before the loneliness of the unmarried clergy. Wandering in his empty church in the middle of the day, he is a forlorn figure, crying out in prayer and need to commune with his Jesus.Later in the review, Ebert poetically questions the purpose of films:“Well,” I asked myself, “why not?” Why must a film explain everything? Why must every motivation be spelled out? Aren’t many films fundamentally the same film, with only the specifics changed? Aren’t many of them telling the same story? Seeking perfection, we see what our dreams and hopes might look like. We realize they come as a gift through no power of our own, and if we lose them, isn’t that almost worse than never having had them in the first place?

Gomez's ""Come & Get It"" leaked online Saturday afternoon even though it was supposed to debut on Seacrest's KIIS-FM show on Monday morning, according to the Los Angeles Times. Instead of getting disappointed, the starlet reached out to her fans and shared the news. ""So, my song got leaked today -- my first single -- and I'm actually kind of excited because you can finally hear it,"" she said in a video uploaded to YouTube. ""I hope you guys like it."" She told fans to head over to RyanSeacrest.com to hear the official version. And they did. In droves. The ""Selenators"" were so excited they crashed Seacrest's website. The Bollywood-infused track, produced by StarGate, is the first official single off the former Disney star's summer album for Hollywood Records. In the chorus, Gomez sings, ""This love will be the death of me, but I know I'll die happily/ I'll know I'll know I'll know/ Because you love me so."" It denotes a decidedly new direction in her music career with a much more sophisticated, sultry sound. Although some might think Gomez is singing about Bieber, producer Jason Evigan, who worked on Gomez's ""Rule the World"" track, insists she didn't delve much into her personal life while writing this album. ""She didn't really want to talk about the Justin [Bieber breakup] stuff too much in her music,"" he told MTV News. ""She didn't want to bash him. She never wanted to write songs about him. She wants to be empowering for these girls not to dwell on guys when guys break your heart. She's super uplifting, positive, amazing person who's, spiritually, she's really strong. And she's a really cool girl. I think she's gonna have a great year for her.""Gomez will perform ""Come & Get It"" live at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards on Sunday, April 14. "

The justices will hear arguments on March 26 on California's Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage and on March 27 on the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman. AFP PHOTO/Nicholas KAMM (Photo credit should read NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafb3c42400003100550e6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am a straight man, aged 35, happily married, with two wonderful daughters. Last week, as others wore red or changed their Facebook icon to support marriage equality, I realized that the Supreme Court arguments on same-sex marriage hit me harder than I thought was possible. I am one of those children, who, according to Justice Scalia, may or may not have been harmed by virtue of having been raised by a same-sex couple.As my emotions swirled last week, I told friends that I don't need to wear red or change my Facebook icon to show my support for marriage equality because I was raised by lesbians and thus I lived the issue. To be fair, my mother, if she had to describe herself in terms of her sexuality, would describe herself as bisexual.While I am the product of an opposite sex marriage, my parents divorced when I was two-years-old, and my mother has been in relationships with women since that time. Her first long-term girlfriend I referred to as my ""other mother"" and she lived with and helped raise me during my formative years. More importantly, I was raised in a radical feminist household, surrounded by books on sexuality (and every other topic) and goddess figures, listened to ""Free to Be You and Me,"" played with both action figures (G.I. Joe) and dolls (Barbie), and was always taught to be comfortable and proud of who I was. And yet... I knew not to say this one thing. Not even to my closest friends all the way through the end of high school. Not even in Park Slope, Brooklyn (!), which is laughable today.The one exception was when at the age of six or seven a kid on the playground confronted me with ""your mom is a lesbian"" and I responded defiantly ""so what?"" But somewhere along the way I learned shame, as every child does.In the 1980s and 1990s being a child of divorce (which I was) was okay because that was a well-known status. But to explain that your parent was now in a same-sex relationship was not something I was able to say out loud. And heterosexism led most to assume that my mom was straight. So I stayed silent. But, the idea that my mother's sexuality was an issue at all is silly because 1) who likes to think their parents even have a sexuality and 2) sexuality is only one aspect of a person and does not solely define them. My mother's demanding career as an author, psychologist and feminist -- a career that often made her unavailable to me -- was much more of a challenge for me to accept as a child.I can testify that all that matters to a child is love and support, respect, stability, and maybe a little independence, all of which I received and am grateful. Which brings me to Justice Scalia and the rest of the Justices to whom I say: I was raised by two women and I am fine, perhaps even better for it, as I had the unique advantage of learning how to be a man from women, and how to be a man who loves women in a world of so much woman hatred.The notion that two people of the same-sex raising a child might cause the child harm is preposterous. Certainly they could cause no more harm than that caused in the many abusive, neglectful or violent straight homes that children suffer. Would you abolish straight marriage based on the clear evidence of harm caused to children in those homes?I wonder how many more years of evidence are required? How much longer are we to endure baseless discrimination?Children are harmed because they sit waiting to be adopted but cannot be adopted by same-sex couples. Or, they are harmed because, like me, they are taught that their parents and families are somehow lesser because they are gay.The notion that same-sex marriage is too new, that more evidence is needed before we know if it is ""a good thing,"" is also offensive. Again, there is much evidence to support that there are ""bad things"" about some straight marriages (e.g. domestic violence, child neglect and abuse) but its overall value is not being questioned.Finally, as a lawyer, the constitutional law question for me is very simple. If a state provides a legal status and benefits emanating from that status but excludes certain people from attaining that status, equal protection requires at least a rational basis to do so. Here, there is only irrational fear, homophobia and outdated notions of marriage that do not suffice to support marriage discrimination. Of course, the attorney arguing in defense of Prop 8 could think of no other circumstances in which a state could discriminate against gay people, and rightly so. It is obviously unconstitutional. In closing, I hope the Supreme Court does justice, that all families are recognized as equal throughout this great country, that my mother's marriage is recognized by the federal government, and know that I have been wearing red in my heart for a long, long time."
