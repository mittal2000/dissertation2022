0,RELIGION,Vatican: Gay People Are 'Our Sons And Daughters',Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bishops-at-vatican-synod-raise-the-need-for-more-inclusionary-language-on-gay-people_us_561531a0e4b0cf9984d7c752,"""[Gay people] are our sons and daughters and brothers and sisters and neighbors and colleagues.""",2015-10-07,"A general view shows bishops, cardinals and Pope Francis (C) during the second morning session of the Synod on the Family at the Vatican on October 6, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561537891600002e00038439.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The world's top bishops and cardinals are meeting at the Vatican for the next three weeks to talk about the church's doctrine on the family. The conference, called a synod, comes at a time when contemporary culture, particularly in the West, seems to have drifted away from traditional church teachings on same-sex marriage and the treatment of LGBT Catholics. Many of the 270 clergymen assembled at the Vatican this week agreed that this gap existed and that the church needs to find a way to engage in dialogue with the world. ""We need to speak about what the church teaches but must also avoid a ghetto mentality,"" Archbishop Maria Celli, President of the Pontifical Council of Social Communication, said during a synod press briefing on Tuesday. The first iteration of the synod made headlines last October after organizers issued a draft summary that suggested bishops were willing to extend a welcome to gay and lesbian Catholics. The initial draft stated that gay people had ""gifts and qualities to offer the Christian community"" and that same-sex partnerships offered gay people ""precious"" support. The synod's participants later backtracked on this, taking thAT paragraph out of the final draft.But it seems that LGBT Catholics are still very much on the minds of the bishops as the church began its second synod this week. Rev. Thomas Rosica, one of the Holy See’s English press officers, said that several bishops raised the need for new language and a new approach to gay Catholics that was more “inclusionary.” ""We do not pity gay persons, but we recognize (them) for who they are. They are our sons and daughters and brothers and sisters and neighbors and colleagues,” Rosica said during a press conference on Tuesday, recalling the bishop’s speeches at the meeting, called a synod. The bishops will not be releasing a mid-conference report this year, choosing instead to wait until the synod is over to share their conclusions with the public. The church leaders will continue to meet over the next three weeks, to talk about issues ranging from divorced Catholics to the Pope Francis’ Holy Year of Mercy, which will begin this December.

4,POLITICS,Homeland Security Secretary Says Border Wall And Fearmongering Are 'Not The Answer' On Immigration,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeh-johnson-immigration-border-wall_us_561548b4e4b021e856d319a7,"Deportation numbers are down, but that doesn't mean immigration enforcement is lying down on the job, he says.",2015-10-07,Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says people in public office should be more responsible in how they discuss and make decisions on immigration.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56154ac21800002d00dc1680.jpeg?cache=6KHVQQf6k4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson wants politicians to tone down their rhetoric on immigration, particularly those who are calling for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and spreading fear about an influx of unauthorized immigrants. ""All of us in public office, those who aspire to public office and who command a microphone, owe the public calm, responsible dialogue and decision-making,"" Johnson said at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's annual conference on Wednesday, ""not overheated, oversimplistic rhetoric and proposals of superficial appeal.""He didn't name names -- and made similar pleas for a measured response well before the presidential campaign season began -- but his words clearly apply to most Republican candidates. Republicans have long accused President Barack Obama of being too weak on immigration, and the candidates vying for the party's nomination have advocated for a number of extreme policies, from stripping U.S.-born children of their citizenship to mass deportation to a border wall along the entire southwest border. Many of those proposals would be either unworkable or impossible to get through Congress. Birthright citizenship is protected by the Constitution, while most experts believe the number of undocumented immigrants -- more than 11 million -- is too high to make mass deportation a realistic prospect. A wall would be similarly a bad idea, given the diverse landscape along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to Johnson, whose department includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection. ""We must protect our borders, but building a wall across the entire southwest border is not the answer,"" he said, before being interrupted by applause.A better solution, he suggested, would be more technology for border security.Johnson said the number of deportations was expected to be down for fiscal year 2015, but did not confirm the figures reported Tuesday by the Associated Press. That report projected that deportations for the fiscal year would be at the lowest number since 2006, although deportations of those convicted of crimes were set to rise slightly. The reduced number, the secretary said, is largely because ICE officers are focusing on convicted criminals, gang members, recent border-crossers, threats to national security and others deemed a high priority. He noted that 84 percent of those deported between March and August of this year were in the top-priority category. ""The number of removals by ICE is down, but we are using those resources to invest in going after threats to public safety, and that takes more time,"" he said. ""It's not just simply rounding everybody up you can find to pump up your numbers.""Johnson added that deportation numbers have also declined because apprehensions along the southern border -- which are also an indicator of total border-crossings -- are down.The final reason is something that might soon change: fraught relationships with local police that ICE is working to mend. Johnson announced last year that ICE would end its controversial Secure Communities program after more than 300 jurisdictions declined to participate. At Wednesday's event, he referred to the poor cooperation, noting that local law enforcement declined 16,500 requests by ICE to hold individuals between January 2014 and June 2015. Johnson said the replacement for Secure Communities, the Priorities Enforcement Program, has ""received a good reception so far"" and that 13 of the 25 largest jurisdictions that declined full cooperation with ICE are now working with the agency again. Some Republicans have pressed Johnson to do more to go after the so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with ICE, particularly after an unauthorized immigrant who had been repeatedly deported was charged with murdering 32-year-old Kate Steinle in San Francisco in July. The Senate plans to vote later this month on an anti-sanctuary cities bill from Sen. David Vitter (R-La.). Asked after his speech whether he believes Congress should get involved, Johnson said he expects more jurisdictions to cooperate with ICE under the Priorities Enforcement Program, although ""it's still a work in progress."" The secretary has said previously that he believes it would be counterproductive to force jurisdictions to work with ICE, and that it's better to have them do so voluntarily. ""In my view, cooperation with law enforcement is the way to go,"" he said Wednesday. ""That's how we work with respect to almost every other thing we do in law enforcement."""

6,POLITICS,This GOP Governor's Comments About The Poor Are Incredibly Revealing,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brownback-kansas-medicaid-expansion_us_56152b33e4b021e856d2f119,"Sam Brownback bashes Medicaid for ""able-bodied adults"" and ""big city hospitals.""",2015-10-07,"The office of Gov. Sam Brownback (R-Kansas) issued a letter on Tuesday saying that expanding Medicaid would be ""morally reprehensible"" because it would help ""able bodied adults ... who choose not to work.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some Republicans want their party to stop bashing poor people as lazy and undeserving of public assistance. Sam Brownback, the conservative governor of Kansas, doesn’t appear to be one of them.Brownback and his allies are in the middle of a major fight over Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Historically, most states made Medicaid insurance available only to certain classes of people, such as children and pregnant women. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, states can now make the program available to all residents with incomes below or just above the poverty line -- with the federal government picking up most of the cost.But Medicaid eligibility doesn’t expand until state officials either pass new laws or take executive actions -- and in 20 states, conservatives opposed to “Obamacare” have successfully blocked that from happening. Kansas is one of them, with Brownback leading the charge.Plenty of people in Kansas are unhappy about this. The hospital industry has been begging lawmakers to take the federal dollars -- citing, among other things, the recently announced closing of a rural facility, Mercy Hospital of Independence, in the southeastern part of the state. In response, some Republican lawmakers conceded that maybe it was time for Kansas to join the program.Brownback is having none of it. And while conservatives who oppose the expansion sometimes rely exclusively on arguments about Medicaid’s efficacy -- or perceived lack thereof -- Brownback has been putting his rhetorical emphasis elsewhere. On Tuesday, the governor's deputy communications director, Melika Willoughby, distributed a letter laying out in detail the heart of Brownback’s argument -- namely, that expanding Medicaid would be “morally reprehensible” because it would help “able-bodied adults … who choose not to work"" and would send money to “big city hospitals.”Brownback isn’t the only Republican who talks about the poor this way. Late last month, Jeb Bush, the presidential candidate and former Florida governor, said he opposes the Affordable Care Act because he doesn’t want to be the kind of official who wins over low-income and minority voters by offering them “free stuff.” That statement, in turn, echoed comments from the 2012 election cycle -- when former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R), Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), and other leading Republicans had a lot to say about “makers and takers,” as well as “the 47 percent” of Americans who depend upon at least one government assistance program.But the Brownback administration's letter is particularly illustrative of such rhetoric. Below are some key sections of the text, along with annotations from The Huffington Post to provide some context that the letter leaves out. The full text of the letter appears at the end of this article.Today, as hospitals nationwide face the ramifications of Obamacare, Democrats are clamoring for an antidote to their self-inflicted wound. They think Medicaid Expansion is the solution. They are wrong. Problems facing rural hospitals are real, but Medicaid Expansion is nothing more than a perpetuation of the original offender—Obamacare. Contrary to what the letter claims, the ""wound"" to the Affordable Care Act -- and, by extension, the hospitals now struggling with lost revenue -- was not inflicted by Democrats. It was inflicted by the Supreme Court, and then by Republican officials like Brownback. The original idea of the law was that reimbursements from newly insured Medicaid beneficiaries would offset cuts to other federal programs. The new arrangement would be more efficient and would keep hospitals financially sound. But in 2012, the court gave states more leeway to opt out of the Medicaid expansion, and now, Republican officials like Brownback are using that leeway to turn down the money -- even though the other cuts are still taking place. Some hospitals have margins big enough to cover these losses. But some hospitals serving large numbers of uninsured patients do not have such resources. The same goes for some hospitals in rural areas. By the looks of things, Mercy Hospital of Independence -- the Kansas facility that is closing -- is one of these.Liberals know the political toxicity of Obamacare, so they’ve continued their call for government-run healthcare under the name of Medicaid Expansion.“Toxicity” is a strong word for a law that, according to the polls, has nearly as many supporters as opponents -- and which contains features that, with only a few exceptions, are wildly popular.As for the bit about “government-run” health care, advocates for single-payer health insurance would actually love more government control beyond Medicaid expansion. In fact, they were livid when lawmakers stripped the Affordable Care Act of the so-called public option for health care insurance, which would have offered an actual government-run plan to compete with private health insurance coverage options.Meanwhile, it's not just liberals calling to expand Medicaid. Plenty of conservatives are, too -- because, notwithstanding their general feelings about the Affordable Care Act, they realize that expanded programs can boost state economies and help needy residents get affordable health care. In Arkansas and Michigan, for example, conservative officials agreed to compromise measures that allowed federal money to start flowing.This masquerading component of Obamacare is riddled with fiscal solvency issues, but Governor Brownback’s primary objection is a moral one: Medicaid Expansion creates new entitlements for able-bodied adults without dependents, prioritizing those who choose not to work before intellectually, developmentally, and physically disabled, the frail and elderly, and those struggling with mental health issues. This isn’t just bad policy, this is morally reprehensible.Put aside the stuff about “able-bodied adults” for just a moment, and focus on that statement about protecting the mentally ill. It is baffling. As Harold Pollack, a professor of social work at the University of Chicago and leading expert on Medicaid, noted recently in the Washington Post, expanding the program would dramatically increase access to mental health treatments. And while it’s true that expanding Medicaid would require states to spend some of their own money as the federal investment tapers down from 100 percent to 90 percent over the course of several years, the investment is small -- particularly when you take into account that states with higher Medicaid enrollment can spend less on other programs that directly or indirectly subsidize care for the uninsured.The math would appear to work out pretty well for Kansas: A 2012 estimate by Urban Institute researchers and published by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation projected that, during the first 10 years of the Affordable Care Act’s implementation, states' extra spending would add up to less than 1 percent of total general fund expenditures. That’s not even taking into account the fact that the extra Medicaid money would also spur economic growth, boosting tax revenues.In short, there’s no reason to think expanding Medicaid would seriously threaten support for the disabled and other vulnerable groups. If anything, the opposite is true....this Obamacare ruse funnels money to big city hospitals, creates a new entitlement class, and fails to rightly prioritize service for disabled citizens. Governor Brownback will maintain his commitment to provide care to vulnerable Kansans before able-bodied adults.The letter’s most misleading claim, which appears several times, is also its most familiar one. It's the idea that people who would receive Medicaid are primarily “able-bodied adults” who “choose not to work.”A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of the population that would gain coverage from expanded Medicaid found that two-thirds of expected beneficiaries live in households where somebody works, and slightly more than half have jobs of their own. Typically, these are people working either in low-wage or part-time jobs, frequently for small businesses that don’t offer coverage. For people living in a household in which no one is employed, at least some and possibly most of them would very much like to have jobs, but they just can’t find them.Does Medicaid end up subsidizing some people who could find employment, but choose not to do so? Of course. All social welfare programs do. But, by and large, the expansion is going to help individuals and families where somebody is working -- and frequently, working very hard. It could be somebody waiting tables at a diner, or juggling custodial shifts at a shopping mall. The problem is that jobs like these provide neither insurance nor enough pay to cover insurance premiums.It remains to be seen how Brownback's rhetoric plays in Kansas. The state has never been particularly generous towards the poor. Its existing Medicaid program is among the stingiest in the country, and it's not like voters there were clamoring for a change before the prospect of expanded Medicaid arose. But regardless of the letter's political impact in Kansas, or even beyond, it's a reminder of the way many Republicans still feel about the poor.Jeffrey Young contributed reporting to this article.

Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) introduced the ""privileged resolution,"" which required the House to take up the matter within two legislative days, on Wednesday. It failed in a 240-183 procedural vote along party lines.The measure charged that the use of taxpayer resources for ""political purposes undermines the integrity of the proceedings of the House and brings discredit to the House,"" and that the Benghazi committee should therefore be dismantled and release within 30 days all unclassified interviews it conducted. Democrats have increasingly gone after the Benghazi committee after House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) -- who will likely be the next speaker of the House -- last week made the inadvertent admission that the committee has a political purpose.""Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee, [and] what are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened,"" he said.McCarthy has apologized repeatedly, and Republicans quickly criticized him and insisted he misspoke. The damage, however, was done: His comments gave Democrats the ammunition they needed to attack the committee, which has cost taxpayers more than $4.5 million. It has been in existence for 17 months and has no end in sight. On Wednesday, Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) filed an ethics complaint against Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and the committee, requesting the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate the extent to which Republicans ""illegally used appropriated funds for political or campaign-related purposes.""Gowdy's office did not return a request for comment on the complaint.Clinton also took advantage of McCarthy's comments, using them in her first national cable TV ad.Slaughter first introduced an amendment to dismantle the Benghazi committee on Tuesday night in a meeting of the Rules Committee, where she is the ranking member. She attempted to strip language from a GOP bill to create a new select committee on Planned Parenthood and replace it with text getting rid of the Benghazi panel. Her amendment failed on a party-line vote.Clinton is set to testify before the Benghazi committee on Oct. 22. The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) told The Washington Post that although the panel appeared to start in the right direction -- focused on getting to the bottom of the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya -- it has since gone after Clinton and her use of private email as secretary of state. ""We have veered so far from that,"" Cummings said, ""it's incredible."" ""Even before Rep. McCarthy’s comments laid bare the true intent of the committee, it’s been clear that Hillary Clinton has always been the focus,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), another member of the select committee, said Wednesday in a statement. ""This is a terrible abuse of taxpayer dollars. Enough is enough, it’s time to shut down the Benghazi Select Committee. If the Committee continues its abusive investigation, Democrats will have to consider how long our continued participation makes sense. We have no interest in lending legitimacy to a committee devoid of any.""This article has been updated to include the statement from Rep. Adam Schiff. "

10,POLITICS,Michigan Lawmakers To Introduce 21 Bills Targeting Kids in Adult Corrections,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michigan-bills-kids-prison_us_561414fbe4b022a4ce5fba8c,Some measures would ban placing youth in adult jails and prisons altogether.,2015-10-06,Michigan lawmakers are introducing a series of bills to reform the way the state treats youth in prison.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56142f351400002900bfc475.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Michigan lawmakers are expected to introduce 21 bills this week that address prison treatment and criminal justice practices for kids in the adult corrections system. Some measures would ban placing youth in adult jails and prisons altogether. The legislative push arrives several months after The Huffington Post published an investigation of the treatment of youth in adult prisons in the state. We found under-18-year-olds being restrained, held in isolation, forcibly extracted from their cells and shocked with stun guns.A number of inmates have sued Michigan, alleging that the state facilitated sexual violence by housing youth with adult inmates. The Michigan Department of Corrections has said it is confident the outcome of the case will be in favor of the state. ""Numerous studies have shown that a young person’s brain is not fully developed until their mid-20s,"" said Democratic state Rep. Harvey Santana, who represents Detroit, in a statement. ""We are throwing children in with hardened criminals and they are not getting the rehabilitation services they so desperately need.""As of 2013, there were about 6,000 youth in adult facilities in the United States. Children of color are more likely to be sentenced as adults: Of the 257 children prosecuted as adults in Chicago between 2010 and 2012, only one was white. There is growing national pressure to reform the criminal justice system, particularly for kids: A new Senate package would ban solitary confinement for juveniles in nearly all cases. Michigan is one of nine states that automatically charges 17-year-olds as adults. One bill state lawmakers are proposing would raise the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction to 18. A second would encourage judges to weigh other factors before waiving a youth out of the juvenile system, such as the kid's culpability and what other options are available.A Detroit teen who spoke to HuffPost, Jamie, was initially sentenced to two concurrent six-month sentences for fighting with a family friend. She served that time in an adult women's facility, where she earned misconduct tickets that led a judge to revise her sentence to up to five years. The tickets were for defying an order, yelling at an inmate and giving a guard an ""intimidating look."" Another bill would ensure that youth under 21 in segregation receive age-appropriate programming and exercise at least five days a week. In Michigan, 28 kids in adult facilities spent an average of 52 days each in punitive segregation between 2011 and 2013. Seventy-nine kids spent an average of 24 days each in some other form of isolation, such as protective custody, according to prison documents. Two bills introduced by Republican state Rep. Kurt Heise would prohibit placing kids in adult jails and prisons to ensure they're put in juvenile facilities where they can receive more age-appropriate treatment. ""The time has come for Michigan to join the rest of the country,"" Heise said in a statement.Proposed changes follow recommendations from a recent report by the Michigan Council on Crime and Delinquency.Chris Gautz, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections, said ""this is a large and complex bill package,"" and that once the bills are introduced, ""we will carefully review them and their possible impact on our operations.""  The video below, originally published in originally published in The Huffington Post Highline article ""Cruel And All-Too Usual,"" shows Jamie, the minor mentioned above, receiving rough treatment from Michigan correctional officers. It may be disturbing to some viewers. "

Jagadish Shukla, the organization's director and a professor of climate dynamics at George Mason University, took the lead on a letter from 20 professors and climate scientists to President Barack Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and White House science adviser John Holdren on Sept. 1, asking them to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, to investigate corporations and other organizations ""that have knowingly deceived the American people about the risks of climate change.""Smith said the letter ""raises serious concerns"" because the Institute of Global Environment and Society receives government funding, and the letter constitutes ""partisan political activity."" “IGES appears to be almost fully funded by taxpayer money while simultaneously participating in partisan political activity by requesting a RICO investigation of companies and organizations that disagree with the Obama administration on climate change,” Smith wrote in a letter to Shukla on Oct. 1. Smith told Shukla that he had until Oct. 8 to preserve all of the communications and research from IGES over the last six years, and to hand over a list of all current and former employees, interns and associates, paid or unpaid.But Shukla’s right to petition the government in this way is outlined in the First Amendment under “redress of grievances.” Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), the ranking Democrat on the science committee, has expressed concerns about the implications of Smith's letter. “I am puzzled as to the Chairman’s intent in writing it,” Johnson told ScienceInsider. “I would resist any attempt to stifle the constitutionally protected right of any citizen, including the nation’s scientists, to engage in free speech without interference.”Smith has an extensive record of climate denial, and a voting record that reflects a long-term relationship with the fossil fuel industry. He’s voted against ending subsidies to the oil industry for exploration, for example. Shukla and his co-signers, in their petition to the Obama administration, pointed out that recent investigations have revealed that some of the companies that helped pioneer the science showing how human activity causes climate change spent decades covering it up. Contrary to the public statements of those companies, their own scientists agreed with Obama and the vast majority of climate scientists.As InsideClimate recently reported, the Energy Department praised Exxon scientists in 1979 for their work studying the danger of rising carbon emissions to the planet as a “national and international service.” But because the spike they saw in carbon emissions was largely due to burning fossil fuels essential to their employer's business, Exxon spent decades funding efforts to deny that science, including an American Enterprise Institute fellow who has said that climate scientists are among the ""most distrusted occupations."" Shukla and his colleagues took issue with this is the kind of duplicitous information in their letter, likening it to efforts of the tobacco industry to publicly deny the health risks of smoking. “A RICO investigation (1999 to 2006) played an important role in stopping the tobacco industry from continuing to deceive the American people about the dangers of smoking,” they wrote. Paul Thacker, a former Senate investigator who is writing a book on congressional staffers, said that while Smith has a right to investigate pretty much anything he sees fit to as committee chairman, he faces a potential loss of credibility for going after scientists for constitutionally protected speech. “They have a right, protected under the Constitution and whistleblower laws, to petition our government,” Thacker said. “Attempts to stop such activity can result in criminal referrals to the Department of Justice. Whistleblowers often face retaliation and it's unfortunate when that comes from Congress, which needs whistleblowers to help them understand when potential corrupt activity is taking place.”Any decision on whether to bring anti-racketeering charges against energy companies rests with the Justice Department, which has not responded to the scientists’ letter.Also on HuffPost:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5613e9db1400005b00bfc39f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Irwin could easily have become a pig in a blanket. Instead the lucky guy is dressed up in a dapper purple sweater. It's keeping him warm at his new home: an animal sanctuary in rural Maryland. ""He will be able to live at the sanctuary for the rest of his life with the 48 other rescued pigs,"" Terry Cummings, co-founder of Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary, said.Irvwin was born in late August at an ""intentional community"" in Virginia, where the community members raise and slaughter animals for food.He was the runt. He had trouble walking, his mother rejected him, and so the folks who'd eventually be eating him were instead bottle feeding the little piggy.""Even though he was being nursed back to health and hand reared, even given a name -- they called him Carrot -- the plan was still to kill him for meat when he was about 6 months old,"" Cummings said.That changed when a visitor to the community saw the wee piglet and convinced folks to let her bring him to the sanctuary, in mid-September.He was a bit over 3 weeks old, and about 3 pounds, at the time his life completely changed. Instead of becoming one of the 100 million-odd pigs killed for meat every year in the U.S., he'd become an ambassador of cute, who ""spends his days running and playing in the sun, chasing chickens, rooting in the dirt and hanging out with his best friend Evie, the three-legged baby goat,"" Cummings said.Irwin's about 10 pounds now. He'll likely expand to be about 50 times that size.He's a special heritage breed of pig that produces an impressive, wooly coat -- if they get to live that long. So at some point, he will no longer need that purple sweater for practical reasons (if we're lucky, he might still wear one in a bigger size for adorableness purposes). There's a strangeness to Irwin's situation, of course -- that being small and weak turned out to be what saved him. Cummings says that it's an oddly normal kind of story at Poplar Spring.""Many of our sanctuary animals have come from similar circumstances. The only reason that their lives were spared was because they were too sick or weak to stay with the group,"" she said. ""It is somewhat ironic that the sickest animal would be the only survivor of the entire family that will be slaughtered.""Since he was saved -- since he is so winning -- Cummings hopes that Irwin's good days ahead will help demonstrate why others like him, strong or weak, should be given that same grace.""He should have a good long life of around 15 years, and he will be very loved and cared for here,"" she said. ""Irwin is so incredibly happy and healthy now. He enjoys his life to the fullest!"" Get in touch at arin.greenwood@huffingtonpost.com if you have an animal story to share! "
14,SPORTS,Congress Is Waking Up To The Unregulated World Of Draft Kings And FanDuel,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-harry-reid-daily-fantasy-sports-scandal_us_56141db2e4b022a4ce5fc344,"""There's absolutely scandalous conduct taking place,"" Sen. Harry Reid said.",2015-10-06,Online fantasy gaming could face Congressional scrutiny after recent gambling scandal.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and other lawmakers called for increased federal examination of daily fantasy sports Tuesday, just days after a new scandal engulfed the fast-growing industry. Over the weekend, an employee of DraftKings, one of the two largest daily fantasy web sites, admitted to releasing confidential information about the prevalence of NFL players in users’ fantasy lineups, a seemingly inadvertent data breach, which drew more attention when the same employee won $350,000 in a competition at FanDuel, DraftKings’ largest competitor. Employees of both companies were allowed to participate in contests on competitor sites until Tuesday, when both DraftKings and FanDuel changed their policies.DraftKings has maintained that there is no evidence that its employee used the information to gain an improper advantage in the FanDuel contest. But the information’s release raises concerns about employees’ access to such data and the protection of daily fantasy users, experts said, and Congressional scrutiny is likely coming to the industry. “We learned yesterday ... that there’s absolutely scandalous conduct taking place with those programs -- fantasy sports,” Reid said Tuesday in response to a question about whether Congress should examine their legality. “So the answer is yes, and I think it should also be a warning shot to everybody that online gaming is a real scary thing and we’d better look at all of it.”Reid, a former chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission, had previously likened daily fantasy to traditional gambling.Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), who in September requested that Congress hold hearings into the legality of the industry, also said that the data leak is a “prime example” of the need for further Congressional examination.“Daily fantasy sports is functioning in a Wild West void within the legal structure,” Pallone said in a statement on Tuesday. “With little legal oversight and deep investments into these sites by the same professional sports leagues that oppose traditional sports wagering, these issues are ripe for Congressional review.”House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) has not scheduled a hearing, though he indicated an openness to the idea after Pallone’s initial request. The latest scandal could make a hearing more likely.“Recent reports raise additional questions about the safety, fairness and integrity of these new platforms for fan engagement,” an Energy and Commerce aide said. “We have a responsibility to protect consumers and ensure that those participating are not being taken advantage of. Our staff is looking into these issues.”Pallone expects the committee to hold a hearing in the ""next month or two,"" he said in an MSNBC interview Tuesday afternoon. Other committees also may take a closer look at the industry. In a statement, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) called on the House Judiciary Committee to hold its own hearing ""to determine whether permitting a multi-billion dollar industry to police itself serves the best interests of the American people.""Pallone and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) also wrote a letter to Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez asking her to review the practices of DraftKings and FanDuel.""These reports raise serious questions about the integrity of these online fantasy sports web sites, and it raises the question of whether there are sufficient consumer and competition safeguards to protect the integrity of these online games,"" the letter said.The New York Times reported Tuesday evening, meanwhile, that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had opened an investigation into the business practices of DraftKings and FanDuel.DraftKings and FanDuel have traditionally kept the idea of outside regulation at arm’s length, particularly amid growing concerns from federal and state legislators, gaming commissions and attorneys general about the murky legal landscape around daily fantasy, which the industry says is protected by an exemption in a 2006 federal gambling law.The companies issued a joint statement Monday that said both have “strong policies in place to ensure that employees do not misuse any information,” and “employees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by internal fraud control teams.” Though the scandal doesn’t rise to the legal level of “insider trading,” it raises “real questions about consumer protections” and internal security controls at the company, according to Marc Edelman, a law professor and sports business expert at the City College of New York.That, along with the rapid growth of daily fantasy, may mean the industry needs the increased attention, said legalsportsreport.com editor Chris Grove, who was among the first to report the scandal. Even if the employee did not use the data improperly in this instance, the revelations indicate that daily fantasy is “an industry growing faster than its ability to self-police,” Grove said. The data leak “suggests that if we’re not seeing abuse now, we can expect that abuse will at least be attempted in the future,” Grove said. “The idea those inclined to fraud have left this world alone doesn’t pass the smell test.”There is no central body that monitors the industry the way gaming commissions regulate traditional gambling, but away from Congress organizations involved in sports gambling and integrity said the scandal made the case for governmental regulation of daily fantasy.It “has underlined the clear and urgent need for government intervention in what is currently an opaque and under-regulated industry,” Chris Eaton, the executive director of the International Centre for Sport Security, a nonprofit that combats betting fraud and match fixing, said in an emailed statement. “Self-regulation in the exploding market will not work.”“It is clear,” Eaton added, “that the U.S. government must act.”This article has been updated to include comment from Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and to note that the New York attorney general has opened an investigation."
