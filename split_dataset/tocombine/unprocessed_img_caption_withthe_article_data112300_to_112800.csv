0,POLITICS,Koch-Backed Ad Betrays Fundamental Misunderstanding Of Congress,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-merkley-koch-ad_n_5697818.html,,2014-08-21,"UNITED STATES - FEBRUARY 6: Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., speaks during a news conference to discuss the introduction of a resolution that would require congressional approval for any military mission in Afghanistan after 2014, on Thursday, Feb. 6, 2014. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d33e1f00004002257402.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Following post first appeared on FactCheck.org.An ad from a Koch-backed group labels Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley an ineffective leader because he “wrote only one bill that became law” in six years. This kind of claim is an attack ad staple, but it betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the ways of Congress.First-term senators, like Merkley, typically get their names on very few bills that stand a chance of becoming law, and even then, the bills usually are relatively minor.By the ad’s measuring stick, virtually every senator who came into office at the same time as Merkley has been a slacker. Two senators have had two sponsored bills each that became law. Merkley was one of four who had one. Four of the senators — including the only two Republicans who took office that year — have had none.The claim also ignores proposed bills that Merkley sponsored that didn’t pass as stand-alone legislation but were incorporated into larger bills. And it overlooks a number of amendments that Merkley proposed that ended up being part of bills that ultimately passed.Freedom Partners, a conservative group that has current and former Koch Industries officials on its board, has invested heavily in the Oregon Senate race, which pits the incumbent, Merkley, against the Republican challenger, pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby. The ad is part of a reported $3.6 million ad campaign from Freedom Partners in Oregon. The election is on Nov. 4. ’Just One’“We work hard,” the narrator in the Freedom Partners ad begins. “We deserve leaders who work just as hard for us. But Sen. Jeff Merkley? In six years, Merkley wrote only one bill that became law. Just one.”That one bill was the relatively obscure S. 1448. Introduced by Merkley in July 2009, it sought to authorize a handful of Oregon Indian tribes to obtain a 99-year lease for trust land. The bill was described by tribal attorney Brett Kenney as a noncontroversial proposal that didn’t appear to have any legislative detractors. It passed the House and Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President Obama in late 2010.American Enterprise Institute scholar Norman J. Ornstein warned, however, that measuring a first-term senator’s record based solely on a count of sponsored legislation that became law is fundamentally flawed.Most bills that pass are sponsored by committee chairs or the committee’s ranking member of the minority party, Ornstein explained, or sometimes subcommittee chairs. Those positions are largely based on seniority. Merkley currently chairs two subcommittees, the Senate Banking Committee’s Subcommittee on Economic Policy and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee’s Green Jobs and the New Economy Subcommittee. But he wasn’t appointed to either position until February 2013.Unless you are a committee chairman or the committee’s ranking member of the minority party (currently Republicans in the Senate), Ornstein told us, you are unlikely to have your name attached to a bill, unless it is a minor bill. The statistics back him up. Of the 37 Senate bills that have been signed into law in 2013 and 2014, 23 were sponsored by either a committee chair or ranking member of the committee. The rest were sponsored by subcommittee chairs or ranking members of subcommittees, or by the Senate majority or minority leaders.In the backup material Freedom Partners supplied to us for the ad, the group noted that when Merkley came into office, Democrats controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress, and had a supermajority in the Senate. They also noted that Oregon’s senior senator, Democrat Ron Wyden, authored and passed six bills during Merkley’s tenure. That’s true, but it only serves to reinforce Ornstein’s point. Wyden has been in the Senate since 1996 and has much more seniority than Merkley. Wyden currently chairs the Senate Committee on Finance.We looked at the legislative record of all 10 senators who, like Merkley, came into office in January 2009. Two of them, Democratic Sens. Tom Udall of New Mexico and Mark Warner of Virginia, have had two sponsored bills become law. Four, including Merkley, had one. And four others — including the only two Republicans to take office at that time — have had none.Since taking office, Merkley has sponsored 227 bills, amendments and resolutions. That ranks him fourth among the 10 senators who took office in January 2009, based on our analysis. Merkley ranks in the middle of the pack with regard to the number of pieces of sponsored legislation that got committee consideration, floor consideration or passed one chamber of government.But Ornstein warns that those types of quantitative measures can be misleading.“This is in no way an effective way to measure the effectiveness of a senator,” Ornstein said. Having only a small number of laws with your name on them “doesn’t mean you are not having an impact on legislation or the legislative process.”For example, he said, Sen. Al Franken’s name isn’t on the Affordable Care Act, but Franken introduced an important amendment on medical loss ratios, requiring insurers to spend 80 percent to 85 percent of premiums on medical care (rather than administrative costs). When former President Bill Clinton touted the Affordable Care Act in his speech at the Democratic Convention in 2012, he highlighted the fact that “individuals and businesses have already gotten more than a billion dollars in refunds from insurance companies because the new law requires 80 to 85 percent of your premium to go to your health care, not profits or promotion.”Franken, who came into office six months after Merkley in 2009, hasn’t written any stand-alone bills that have become law.Some bills don’t pass as stand-alone legislation, but later get folded into larger bills. For example, in July 2009 Merkley proposed the Small Business Jump Start Act of 2009, a bill that sought to increase a tax deduction for start-up businesses. As a stand-alone bill, it was referred to a committee and died. But Merkley later added it as an amendment to the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which was sponsored by former House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank and became law.Similarly, Merkley’s bill, the Bank On Our Communities Act of 2009 — which sought to create a $30 billion fund to provide capital to community banks for small-business loans — also stalled as stand-alone legislation. But it was folded into the Small Business Jobs Act as an amendment.Other examples include Merkley’s Crowdfund Act — a bill that sought to limit how much small investors could put into crowd-funding sites — which was added as an amendment to the JOBS Act in 2012, and Merkley’s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2013 — a bill that sought to provide loans for communities to repair their water systems — which was added to the Water Resources Development Act of 2013.Merkley’s campaign provided a number of other examples, but you get the idea.Merkley also authored the so-called Volcker rule, a key provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act — a bill that President Obama called “the toughest financial reform” since the Great Depression. Named after Paul Volcker, a former Fed chairman and Obama economic adviser who proposed it, the rule places restrictions on certain banks and financial firms on proprietary trading — that is, it limits the ability of financial institutions to invest their own money in stocks, bonds and other products for their own profit. Politico called Sens. Carl Levin and Merkley “the two top advocates of strengthening the ‘Volcker rule’ throughout the Wall Street reform debate.” And while the Volcker rule amendment didn’t pass, a compromise was forged in conference committee that Merkley and Levin called “a victory.” Merkley touted the controversial rule as one of his top achievements in Congress in an interview with the Huffington Post in January.Merkley was also part of a small group of Democratic senators who spearheaded important changes to the filibuster rule, to help expedite executive- and judicial-branch nominations.Ornstein said that if you talked to committee and subcommittee leaders, “they’d tell you that Merkley is a very effective lawmaker.” We at FactCheck.org take no position on that, of course, but we caution readers not to put much stock into a claim about the effectiveness of a first-term lawmaker based on the number of sponsored stand-alone bills that have become law.Obamacare and Higher PremiumsThe narrator in the Freedom Partners ad also attacks Merkley for his support of the Affordable Care Act, which it refers to as Obamacare.“He promised to fix Obamacare,” the narrator says, “but last year, our premium increases were the highest on the West Coast. This year, they’re going even higher.”On screen, the ad shows a graphic claiming rates have gone up 55 percent for people aged 27, 24 percent for people aged 40, and 31 percent for people aged 64. The ad cites a Forbes article about a study of insurance premiums by the conservative Manhattan Institute.Although the ad, without qualifiers, seems to suggest that rates have gone up by these amounts for all Oregonians, the Manhattan Institute study looked at the changes in insurance rates in the individual market after passage of the Affordable Care Act. The individual market is for those who buy insurance on their own as opposed to through an employer. About 267,000 Oregonians, 7 percent of the state’s population, purchased their own insurance in 2012, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.We have written previously about other qualifiers people ought to consider when weighing the Manhattan Institute analysis. For example, the analysis looked at the five least expensive plans before and after enactment of the ACA, but did not adjust for the fact that the ACA requires certain minimum benefits, which many individual market plans didn’t meet. By and large, the post-ACA plans are more robust (whether purchasers like or want that or not).The Manhattan Institute analysis also didn’t include premiums for catastrophic plans, which could offer a cheaper option to those 27-year-olds. Nor did it account for subsidies, which the Manhattan Institute estimates will be available to 45 percent of uninsured Oregonians, or 303,690 people.As for the claim that “this year” insurance premiums are “going even higher,” Freedom Partners points to an Associated Press story that reported that Moda, the insurance company with the largest share of the individual market in Oregon, will increase rates by 10.6 percent on average in 2015. That’s accurate, according to an Aug. 1 report from the state’s Department of Consumer and Business Services, but the report also noted that a number of other companies will be reducing rates in 2015.Although the rate changes vary by insurer, as well as age, location, number of family members and plan choice, Oregon’s Insurance Commissioner Laura Cali stated in a press release that “the approved rates are lower on average than in 2014, reflecting the effect of competition and Oregonians’ expanded access to health coverage.” We caution, however, that that’s not a weighted average, meaning the rates of smaller insurers were counted equally with those of larger insurers. A spokesman for the department said a weighted average was not calculated because people can select any plan they wish in the market exchange.A table showing sample rate changes in 2015 by company and plan can be viewed here."

Rosenberg also tweeted that ""Kabul's chief prosecutor, police general [and] four regular police"" escorted him through immigration, and that he had a ""police escort"" to the plane. The catalyst appeared to be his article about Afghan officials planning to form an interim government to break the country's election stalemate.

Nigeria's president announced a multi-billion-dollar plan Thursday to repair and privatize the oil-rich nation's decrepit national power grid that forces people to rely on private generators to provide electricity. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13bec2300003200d0b9e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nigeria is the greenest populous country in the world, but it is so entirely by accident. We fuel a population north of 170 million -- the seventh largest in the world -- on an available installed grid electricity generation capacity of fewer than 6GW. In the context of Barack Obama's initiative last week with his inaugural Africa Leaders Summit and the lofty promises of the ""Power Africa"" initiative it seems worth pointing out that the problems with the development of Nigerian power generation and distribution are basic economics, and internal failures of local policy. Not only does Nigeria lag massively behind the African average (shocking when you consider that Nigeria is Africa's largest economy by GDP) our grid capacity per capita rounds, on a one decimal point basis, to zero. In fact, the average Nigerian, who uses 136KWH per year, consumes just 3 percent of the power of the average South African, 5 percent of the average Chinese citizen and, under a quarter of the average Indian. We have an installed capacity that is a fraction of the per capita mean of the other ""BRICS"" and ""MINT"" countries that Nigeria loves to compare itself to.Let it not be too bold to say that Nigeria is bad at generating and distributing electricity.In Nigeria only one in four have access to the grid, and of those that do only a small minority have supplies of electricity for more than a few hours a day. ""Epileptic"" power outages are characteristic of a sector starved of investment: first as a state-owned monopoly and now, following privatization, from poorly conceived price controls and private regional distribution monopolies that have scared away necessary capital, impeded competition and discouraged new entrants to the market.The government projects an increase in available installed grid capacity to 10GW by the end of 2014 -- already woefully inadequate in the context of present demand -- but this will doubtless be a dismal over-estimation. This lack of electricity is constraining our economy and inhibiting growth. It seems that Nigeria will continue to do the world's climate a favor for at least a decade to come.In September 2013 President Goodluck Jonathan handed over control of 15 state-owned electricity companies to new private owners. It was hoped that the move would encourage essential investment, but in reality it has been a fiasco. The newly established Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading plc (NBET) is now the sole purchaser of power from the national grid. It would seem its only purpose is to obstruct development in the power sector. The NBET fixes the price at which power is sold and the internal rate of return (IRR) for power projects. As a result greenfield generation projects struggle to get off the ground as they battle through a regulatory nightmare, sometimes for many years, before construction can even begin.If we baked bread like we generate power then we'd starve.Think about it like this: at present a baker, confident that his bread will have to compete on price and quality, determines how and when he will set up a bakery based on his projection of supply, demand, his costs and his product's quality and differentiation. However if all the bread in the country was required to be bought by a government ministry through contracts negotiated before bakeries could even commence construction, and not through a flexible and responsive market exchange, it would not just have an effect on the sale of bread but on the rate at which bakeries were built. After all, when the ministry determines what it will pay for bread based on assumptions on how much profit each particular baker will make, the wages the baker proposes to pay his workers, as well as the projected cost of flour and butter, until accord can be reached on these costs not a single foundation will be dug. As a result the population continues to suffer from limited supply and choice.Further, in Nigeria there is a severe misunderstanding of the essential role that financiers play in development. No banks will let the developer of a power project draw down on the funds to start building until an iron-clad purchase arrangement is in place. Nor will a banker or financier give the gas producer a loan to develop gas fields or the downstream gas supplier capital to build additional pipelines in order to supply fuel to the prospective power plant until the banker is sure that the power plant is actually being built.This means that in Nigeria the majority of electricity is generated by expensive small private diesel and petrol generators, and if a household cannot afford a generator they go without. Ironically then fixing the price and profitability of power does not just create shortfalls in supply but, in aggregate, results in some of the most expensive electricity in the world; which most Nigerian's can scarcely afford.We ignore market forces at our peril. The only regulation in the power sector should be based on the interests of safety and protecting the environment. These are the only regulations we can afford."

Left-leaning groups argue they increase reliance on standardized testing and discourage creativity and flexibility in the classroom. Some conservative groups say they amount to a federal takeover of education.Although the standards were developed and implemented at the state level, the Obama administration encouraged their adoption through a competitive-grant program called Race to the Top, which gave money to cash-strapped states during the recent economic downturn.Several Republican-led states have dropped Common Core this year, including Indiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma.

The images from that tragedy are still haunting today.In Pearl's case, it wasn't until 2013 that a suspect was finally arrested in his murder.The Poynter Institute offers up some great advice for when it may be permissible for news outlets to publish graphic images:• What is my journalistic purpose? • What organizational policies and professional guidelines should I consider? • What are my ethical concerns? • Who is the audience -- and who are the stakeholders affected by my decision? What are my alternatives?There is no news value in showing Foley's death. He is dead. We know that. We already know ISIS is brutal and savage.YouTube is to be lauded for removing the video shortly after it was posted, as the International Business Times reported.

Both cases reveal the persistence of racial divisions and social inequality in the Unites States, the newspaper argues, and highlight the perception of many in America's black communities that they are disproportionally targeted by police.""The Michael Brown affair reminds us of the long road that remains ahead to abolish the racial barrier that still divides the U.S,"" Le Monde says.British newspaper The Guardian also connects the recent shooting to the Trayvon Martin case, saying that Michael Brown is one in a long list of victims of racial prejudice. ""Such things do not happen, by and large, to unarmed young white men,"" the newspaper writes. The Guardian’s editorial board also says that while race relations in the United States have radically improved since the Alabama bus boycott in the 1950s, millions of people are still left behind. ""For all the progress on civil rights, America’s racial wounds are still open,"" it concludes.Also in the U.K., The Independent says the protests in Ferguson were an ""explosion waiting to happen,"" pointing to a disproportionate number of arrests of young black men in the city and an underrepresentation of blacks in Ferguson’s police force. ""As Martin Luther King also observed, 'a riot is the language of the unheard,'"" the paper writes. Spanish newspaper El Pais argues that the crisis in Ferguson is far from unique. ""This situation, with variations, is repeated unequally across the geography of the USA,"" it says. The United States has shown that it can be the most powerful country in the world and one of the largest democracies with a multiracial society, based on immigration and a legal system that guarantees full equality of its citizens. But outbursts like Ferguson show that much remains to be done and that if problems are ignored they don’t disappear, but tend to increase, sometimes disproportionately.Left-leaning Mexican newspaper La Jornada addresses what it perceives as persistent racial discrimination in the United States and faults U.S. President Barack Obama for not acting on the issue early in his first term.""Although our neighboring country abolished segregationist laws that prevailed until after the middle of the 20th century, the U.S. remains structurally a racist society,"" the paper writes. ""This is reflected not only in the political and institutional underrepresentation of minorities, but also in labor, police and judicial practices.""La Jornada also slammed the attitude of Ferguson's authorities, pointing specifically to its security forces. ""Far from acting with transparency, prudence and sensitivity,"" it writes, ""local authorities have tried to cover up the alleged murder of Brown and have tolerated further police excesses in suppressing the protests.""The Chinese government's official news agency Xinhua used the crisis in Ferguson as an opportunity to chastise the United States for violating human rights domestically while accusing foreign governments of infringing on people's rights.""The Ferguson incident once again demonstrates that even if in a country that has for years tried to play the role of an international human rights judge and defender, there is still much room for improvement at home,"" says Xinhua writer Li Li."

I walk up 81st to Park because I know I have a better chance of getting a cab there. I'm in flip-flops, a skirt and a blouse. I call my mom like I always do in the morning. And as I'm walking by construction workers on 81st, I get catcalled.""Hey sexy.""""God damn, girl.""Some comments come in Spanish, and while I don't speak it I'm sure they're not ""you look like a smart woman"" or ""have a nice day.""""Who's that?"" my mother asks.""Some stupid construction guys.""As I continue ignoring them, trying to talk to my mom, I'm later met with ""stupid bitch.""Yeah, because not responding to an old man's cat call by turning around, dropping panties and making love to you right there on the street makes me a stupid bitch.Doree Lewak, who penned a piece for The New York Post entitled ""Hey, Ladies -- Catcalls Are Flattering! Deal With It"" seems to think women like myself -- educated women who don't need the flattery or commentary of random men on the street to feel beautiful, sexy or attractive -- are ""sanctimonious."" That women like myself who find cat calling embarrassing and awkward all went to Vassar apparently. No, women like myself just prefer the ability to walk up a block on a summer day in a sundress, showing skin not to attract attention but because it's hot out and we're about to stand on a crowded subway platform with four hundred other people, without feeling like a piece of meat. Without having other people around us turn around and look at us like we're doing something to garner loud, rude, obnoxious attention. I was also taught -- as were the men I choose to date -- how to speak to people respectfully. Catcalling isn't about flattery, and the men doing aren't trying to make you feel beautiful or special. They're doing it because of a sense of entitlement. Because to them, every woman is fair game regardless of what time of day it is or where you are or what the woman is doing. It's not because women want attention, it's because the men do. And when the whistles and comments garner nothing but a dirty look and a desperate effort to ignore, the man's ego -- that only moments previous told him despite his beer belly, his unshowered body or his lack of any idea of how to speak to a woman, he deserved that chick walking up the block simply because he existed and is a man -- gets a blow and suddenly the woman is a bitch, or a skank, or ugly. We're not ignoring you because we find you appalling, or your tactics vile and insulting. No, it's because we're all prude bitches who aren't grateful enough that a man as upstanding and awesome as you is showing interest in us! And there is nothing I love more than walking up the block to work and being loudly addressed as ""bitch"" while surrounded by professional men and women I will probably be interacting with throughout the day. Sorry Doree, the problem isn't sanctimonious or prude women. It's men who feel entitled to speak to a woman however way they feel regardless of how it makes the woman feel. It's older men who want to prove to their buddies that at 45, they can still talk to hot 20-year-olds. It's men who don't know how to strike up an actual conversation with a woman because they are not intelligent enough that they use the most basic of sexualized commentary to try to initiate contact. That's the problem. I've always wanted to see a pack of flamboyant gay men catcall the catcallers. Stand in front of a construction site and shout at those burly, straight masculine men.""Ohhh, nice pecs hunny.""""Damn boy, you look good in orange.""""Mmm, that hard hat makes me hard.""Let's see how quickly these men change their tunes. Let's see how quickly these men enjoy being ""complimented"" by someone they aren't interested in. Sexualized by someone they would never have sex with. Turned into a piece of visual meat for someone they don't want. Reduced down to nothing more than a sexual object and told so in public. Embarrassed in front of their coworkers for doing nothing but walking to their job.Maybe then they'll realize that this concept of ""every woman wants me to tell them how sexy they are"" will pass, and that all we really want to do is make it to work without our mothers asking us why that man just called us ""little mama."""

The judge also sentenced him to serve three years of supervised release with extra limitations on his travel during that time and to pay a $5,000 fine.Federal prosecutor Kim Dammers said she believes the sentence outlined in the plea agreement is appropriate given the seriousness of the offense and Davis' lengthy and violent criminal history, which includes convictions for battery and aggravated assault.U.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones told Davis he's heard from his nieces and nephews that the rapper is a talented musician with a potentially bright future and warned him not to squander that.""You're still a young man, and you can still do a lot if you follow and abide by the law,"" Jones said.Davis' lawyers asked the judge to consider recommending that he get credit for about 11 months served in the DeKalb County jail since his arrest in September. The judge said he would consider that but that he felt it was a matter for the Bureau of Prisons.The lawyers said Davis has struggled to with addiction to a mixture of cough syrup and soda known as lean and asked that the judge recommend that he be sent to a facility with a recovery program. Lawyer Drew Findling said Davis would prefer to serve his time on the West Coast to be away from distractions closer to home.""He understands he has some work ahead of him, and his goal is to bring a resolution to this case through this sentence and to get back to something that is very important to him and his fans and that is to perform,"" Findling said after the hearing.A man who said he was a friend of the rapper's called police early Sept. 14 to say Davis was walking down the street behaving violently, according to a police report. When police arrived, Davis smelled strongly of marijuana, cursed at them, called them names and threatened to shoot them, according to the report.Police arrested him on a disorderly conduct charge and found a clear baggie with what they believe was marijuana and a loaded handgun, the report says. An ambulance was called, and Davis was sedated and taken to Grady Memorial Hospital."

This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, August 20, 2014.FIRST SUFFOLK/USA TODAY MIDTERM POLL FINDS CLOSE RACE IN NORTH CAROLINA - Susan Page: ""North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan is all but tied with Republican challenger Thom Tillis in a midterm showdown likely to help determine control of the Senate, a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll finds. The Tar Heel State survey, which launches a series looking at key Senate and gubernatorial contests across the country this fall, shows an electorate that is feeling a bit better about the economy but decidedly negative toward politics. Voters are inclined to have an unfavorable view of each candidate and overwhelmingly disapprove of the legislative bodies in which they serve. Hagan leads Tillis, the speaker of the North Carolina General Assembly, by 45%-43%, an edge within the poll's margin of error of 4.4 percentage points. Libertarian candidate Sean Haugh could hold the balance: His supporters, 5% overall, disproportionately identify Tillis as their second choice."" [USA Today, Suffolk]Polling average shows candidates nearly tied - HuffPollster's model, including all publicly available polling, gives Hagan 42.3 percent and Tillis 41 percent, with Haugh taking 6.8 percent. [Chart]PROFOUND RACIAL GAP IN VIEWS OF POLICE - Frank Newport: ""Blacks in the U.S. have a significantly lower level of confidence in the police as an institution than do whites. Combined 2011-2014 data measuring Americans' confidence in the police shows that 59% of whites have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police, compared with 37% of blacks. The police are among the three highest-rated institutions out of 17 tested in terms of whites' confidence, behind only the military and small business. Among blacks, police drop to seventh on the list, behind not only the military and small business, but also the presidency, the church or organized religion, the medical system, and television news….This racial gap in confidence in the police has been evident in the data throughout the past decade and a half that Gallup has been measuring these trends on an annual basis. Notably, this substantial racial gap is much more muted in terms of confidence in the criminal justice system. Those confidence ratings are low in general, but there is no difference between the views of blacks and whites in terms of positive confidence in the criminal justice system. Blacks are, however, somewhat more likely to say they have very little or no confidence in the justice system than are whites."" [Gallup]SUPPORT FOR AIR STRIKES IN IRAQ - Aaron Blake: ""President Obama's decision to launch airstrikes in Iraq was a popular one -- especially among his biggest political adversaries, conservative Republicans. According to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, 63 percent of conservative Republicans and 61 percent of all Republicans support Obama's decision to launch the airstrikes. By comparison, 54 percent of Democrats and 49 percent of independents also sign off on the use of force. Americans overall support the action 54 to 39 percent. But just because Obama's big decision was a popular one doesn't mean he's suddenly won a bunch of new supporters. In fact, quite the contrary. His approval rating on his handling of Iraq remains at just 42 percent -- unchanged from two months ago when the situation in northern Iraq was deteriorating quickly."" [WashPost]Largely consistent with earlier polls - A Pew Research/USA Today poll released earlier in the week and a HuffPost/YouGov poll last week also found support for the air strikes, although the HuffPost survey also found an uptick in approval for Obama's handling of the situation in Iraq. [Pew, HuffPost]ARE VOTER SWINGS IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS A MYTH? - Andrew Gelman shares a new paper co-authored with David Rothschild, Sharad Goel and Doug Rivers: ""How can election polls swing so much given the increasingly polarized nature of American politics, where switching one’s support between candidates is a significant move? We investigate this question by conducting a novel panel survey of 83,283 people repeatedly polled over the last 45 days of the 2012 U.S. presidential election campaign. We find that reported swings in public opinion polls are generally not due to actual shifts in vote intention, but rather are the result of temporary periods of relatively low response rates by supporters of the reportedly slumping candidate. After correcting for this bias, we show there were nearly constant levels of support for the candidates during what appeared, based on traditional polling, to be the most volatile stretches of the campaign. Our results raise the possibility that decades of large, reported swings in public opinion — including the perennial “convention bounce” — are largely artifacts of sampling bias."" [Gelman]Implications for weighting by party - In a separate blog post, Gelman adds more: ""From a 'methods' point of view, the key step is to poststratify by party ID....Sometimes researchers want to play it safe by using traditional methods — most notoriously, in that recent note by Michael Link, president of the American Association of Public Opinion Research, arguing against non-probability sampling on the (unsupported) grounds that such methods have 'little grounding in theory.' But in the real world of statistics, there’s no such thing as a completely safe method. Adjusting for party ID might seem like a bold and risky move, but, based on the above research, it could well be riskier to not adjust."" [WashPost]'Not Quite' - Aaron Blake: ""The study is an interesting one, and it's quite feasible that interpreted swings in polling do have something to do with supporters of a slumping candidate simply not responding to pollsters. That's a fair point. To say the study suggests swing voters are a myth, though, goes too far.... A presidential campaign isn't a great gauge of swing-iness....While the unrepresentative sample is one thing, the opt-in nature of the survey is perhaps more likely to skew the results. After all, those motivated to respond to polls of their own volition, we would argue, are probably more politically engaged. And more politically engaged people tend to be firmer in their convictions and candidate choices."" [WashPost]Other Reactions: -Kevin Collins (D): ""This, more than any other reason, is why list-based sampling using voter files is SO much better than RDD samples...I don't think this result from @DavMicRot surprised many in the progressive analytics community"" [@kwcollins here and here]-Logan Dobson (R): ""But, of course, people dejected enough not to want to answer a pollsters question might also be dejected enough not to vote..."" [@LoganDobson]A TALE OF TWO COMMON CORE POLLS - Cory Turner: ""Two new polls this week attempt to quantify the public's feelings for the Common Core State Standards. The K-12 benchmarks in English and math were little known this time last year. But they've since become the subject of a high-profile political fight. Now a majority of the public opposes them. Or do they? Poll No. 1, out today, puts support for the Core at just 33 percent. But Poll No. 2, released yesterday, puts it at 53 percent. That's a big difference...PDK/Gallup asked it this way: 'Do you favor or oppose having the teachers in your community use the Common Core State Standards to guide what they teach?' The result: 60 percent of respondents said they oppose, which isn't all that surprising since the question hits on what we know, from the poll, is opponents' greatest fear: that the Core will somehow limit teachers. Here's how Education Next phrased that question: 'As you may know, in the last few years states have been deciding whether or not to use the Common Core, which are standards for reading and math that are the same across the states. In the states that have these standards, they will be used to hold public schools accountable for their performance. Do you support or oppose the use of the Common Core standards in your state?' See the differences? It's longer, for sure, with more context. 'States have been deciding whether or not to use the Common Core' sends a subtle but clear message: no federal takeover here. Also, take a second look at this line: 'In the states that have these standards, they will be used to hold public schools accountable for their performance.' That idea — accountability — polls really well with Americans."" [NPR, Gallup, Education Next]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday via email!

So, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday, Aug. 20, in Los Angeles by Oxman’s attorney, Sark Ohanian, Bieber sent his bodyguard, Dwayne Patterson, to grab Oxman’s camera, telling him to ""do whatever you have to do to get that [memory] card."" The Bieberguard then, according to the complaint, grabbed Oxman in a chokehold, picked him up and slammed him into the hood of a vehicle, roughing him and his photographic equipment up under Bieber’s watchful eye until another photographer took video of it on his cell phone.Patterson allegedly loosened his grip on Oxman when he let loose on the second photographer. “You think I’m that stupid to get caught by one of your little phone cameras?” the suit quotes Patterson as saying.While the lawsuit, which seeks damages for assault and battery, negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress, doesn’t claim Bieber physically attacked Oxman (he only “lame fights” people, as he did with Orlando Bloom), it alleges Bieber helped destroy Oxman’s equipment.Kauai resident Levi Lancaster watched as the photographer ran from the beach to the parking lot while Bieber's guards chased him. When Patterson reached Oxman, Lancaster said he ""put the man in a headlock and lifted him off the ground until he dropped his camera and keys. . . [Oxman] was really calling for help.""Bieber apparently yelled to his security guards, but Lancaster said it was to make sure that they had the man's camera. ""How can you go out to Shipwreck's and not expect people to take pictures?"" Lancaster told the local newspaper The Garden Island. Patterson was arrested on the scene for third-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal property damage, according to county spokesperson Sarah Blane. He was released after posting $3,000 bail."
