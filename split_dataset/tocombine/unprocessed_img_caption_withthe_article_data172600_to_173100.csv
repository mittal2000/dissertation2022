Especially for sleep. All too often, when there is time for sleep, we can't. Our minds are too busy to turn off. We are a tired country. Would it surprise you that 43 percent of Americans ages 13- 64 say they rarely or never get a good night's sleep on weeknights?Statistics from the National Sleep Foundation report: More than half (60 percent) say that they experience a sleep problem every night or almost every night (i.e., snoring, waking in the night, waking up too early, or feeling un-refreshed when they get up in the morning.)"" And 15 percent of adults between 19 and 64 and 7 percent of 13-18 year olds say that they sleep less than six hours on weeknights.When it comes to sleep, amount, depth, and quality matter. The National Sleep Foundation offers clear and compelling recommendations for good ""sleep hygiene.""  So why are we a nation struggling with sleep? Technology. Technology is great, until it isn't. In our always-on, always-connected lifestyles, we are overwired. Our capacity to work from anywhere at anytime of the day is having a ripple effect of negative consequences for our health, our happiness, our relationships and our sleep. It seems that the more connected we are and the more distractions we face and, the less effective we become. Being less effective means we have to work more hours to get caught up. And the longer we work, the less sleep we have. The less sleep we have, the less effective we are. It is a never-ending, depressing downward spiral. What are our options? Unplug. Turn it off. Just say no. Yes, this is easier said than done. Stepping back from our overwired lives requires discipline. The pressure comes from within us. We are biologically wired to connect. With every new email, we receive a new nugget of information. From this nugget, we can get a squirt of the ""feel-good"" neurochemical dopamine that may become addicting. The pressure also comes from around us. People demand that we drop what we are doing to solve their problems. Here are five recommendations to reverse the never-ending downward spiral and improve your sleep.For more by Camille Preston, Ph.D., PCC, click here.For more on sleep, click here."

But what happens when it's someone you're related to? This even more awkward, because you aren't sure of the standard behavior. You don't want to be seen as rude or even overzealous. It's a very awkward fine line that we often don't understand ourselves. Everyone has two sides of their families. Often people are more close to one side, while they could go a decade without seeing. And that's just fine. Life happens, and for whatever reason, rifts occur and people move on and separate from the herd. It's a natural progression.I've never been close with my father's side of the family. They were never around when I was a kid and even when they were, after a certain period of time the situation would become incredibly awkward. Every time I saw them, they would call me by the wrong name or even by my mother's name. Even in adulthood, the relationship is very one-sided and often feels over before it starts. It's even more bizarre when you run into more than one estranged relative and they introduce a new cousin, someone you're expected to embrace -- but just can't. How can you be expected to fall into place with a random person? I've met cousins that have lived in my town and only ever come across one that I felt a connection to. The rest I feel like I can't be bothered with because they haven't made the effort and they aren't as important to me. I've always been extraordinarily close with my mother's side. They know my past, they know everything and always have my back. Literally everything I am is because of them and all of the lessons I've been taught are from them. I know more about my maternal aunt Mame than I do about my paternal grandmother because she is more than willing to share our family's history, whereas my father's family history is very shaky and unknown. Although my father loves going down memory lane, it's usually his own personal memories and not ones of relatives past.With my mother's side of the family, the standard behavior is a hug, kiss, nose grab and of course the standard, ""When are you getting a job?"" It's familiar and it's a source of comfort. From the time we were kids, we were always taught that nothing comes before or after family. As long as we remain true and loyal to them, we'll always have a place to call home. The question that remains is what about the other relatives, who simply don't feel like home? Do we just simply ignore them, or do we take the initiative and make a solid attempt at a relationship that may blow up in our faces?Do you believe there is specific etiquette when it comes to family and behavior, or is it just like with any other person -- and it's best to take things as they come?"

But the disruption to normal life could well affect millions of others, experts say.From New York City to commuter towns to Atlantic Ocean seaside resorts, daily routines have been turned upside down by power outages, fuel shortages, blocked roads, closed schools and canceled trains and buses.Thousands of people are scrambling to find housing, and children missed as much as a week of school. Homeowners are relying on candles, flashlights and canned food as temperatures dip to wintry levels.Elderly people have been trapped in high-rise apartments with no lights or working elevators, and sick people living alone have been unable to refill prescriptions.In Fairfield, Connecticut, a waitress at a downtown cafe brought her elderly mother to work. ""She has no where to go and can't function alone in the dark,"" said the frazzled waitress.Such challenges are ""the grinding, daily wear and stress of a natural disaster,"" said George Bonanno, a clinical psychology professor who specializes in post-traumatic stress disorder at Teachers College at Columbia University in New York.Some people will develop anxiety, despair and relationship problems, he said, while others could over time see their immune systems compromised and get sick more easily.Psychological research shows the leading impact of natural disasters is post-traumatic stress syndrome, characterized by nightmares, flashbacks or a sense of detachment, along with depression and other anxiety disorders.Among those particularly at risk are people who feel they have little control over their lives or have a fatalistic world view, according to research.""You definitely worry about folks getting depressed, hopeless, feeling they don't have control,"" said David Yusko, assistant clinical director at the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania.Many people may experience sleep problems, panic attacks, rapid heartbeats and gastro-intestinal distress, he said.That sense of control is key, said Scott Feldman, a social worker who recounted helping a young displaced mother on New York's Staten Island, which was devastated by the storm.The woman, with one baby 18 months old and a second just seven weeks old, called the delivery at a shelter of some special baby formula a miracle, he said.Feldman reminded her that, rather than it being a miracle, she had advocated for her children, let neighbors know what she needed and was part of a community.""It gave her more of a sense of control over her life, and that's really important,"" Feldman said.

One, the Great Cholesterol Myth has been the foundation of the boneheaded dietary advice you and I have been saddled with for the past 30 years, ""official"" dietary advice that has directly contributed to the greatest epidemic of obesity, diabetes and heart disease in history. And two, belief in the Great Cholesterol Myth has caused us to take our eye off the ball when it comes to preventing heart disease. Belief in the Great Cholesterol Myth has caused us to neglect the real causes of heart disease while obsessively focused on an innocuous molecule that's essential for life and has only a minor role in heart disease.The Great Cholesterol Myth is actually a series of related myths. Here are eight of my favorites.  MYTH: High cholesterol is the cause of heart disease. FACT: Cholesterol is a fairly insignificant player in heart disease.MYTH: High cholesterol is a good predictor of heart attacks. FACT: High cholesterol is a lousy predictor of heart attacks. Half the people admitted to hospitals with heart disease have normal cholesterol, and plenty of people with elevated cholesterol have perfectly healthy hearts.  MYTH: Lowering cholesterol with statin drugs will prolong your life. FACT: There is no data showing statins have any impact on longevity.MYTH: Statin drugs are perfectly safe. FACT: Statin drugs have significant side effects, including loss of memory and libido, muscle pain and fatigue, and approximately 65 percent of doctors don't report those side effects, according to a 2007 study. MYTH: Statin drugs are appropriate for men, women, children and the elderly. FACT: The only group in which statins have been shown to have even a modest effect is in middle-aged men who've already had a heart attack. If you're not in that group, you've got no business on a statin drug. MYTH: Saturated fat is dangerous. FACT: Saturated fat is mostly neutral and may even have some health benefits. A recent peer-reviewed study has shown no association between saturated fat and heart disease. MYTH: The higher your cholesterol, the shorter your lifespan. FACT: In the Framingham Study, the people who actually lived the longest had the highest cholesterol.  MYTH: A high-carbohydrate diet protects you from heart disease. FACT: Diets that substitute carbohydrates for saturated fat may actually increase the risk for heart disease.

5,TRAVEL,How Expats And Travelers Could Help Obama,Andrew Burmon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/expat-overseas-voters-obama_us_5b9c7b50e4b03a1dcc7f1048,"But being surrounded by Obama's international fans doesn't necessarily turn Americans toward the Democratic Party or, for",2012-11-06,"BERLIN - FEBRUARY 05: Expatriate American citizen Susan Rambow, originally from Wilmington, DE and who has been living in Berlin, Germany for nine years, makes a donkey, symbol of the Democratic Party, kick after casting her ballot in Super Tuesday primaries at a polling station organized by Democrats Abroad February 5, 2008 in Berlin, Germany. Analysts are predicting a tight race between Democratic candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c7b502100003300c52466.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Though the swing state's worth of the American electorate that lives or are currently traveling overseas could conceivably change the outcome of today's presidential election, the group has been ignored by pollsters and analysts. In fact, this geographically diverse constituency is so overlooked that estimates of their numbers range from 3 million to 6.3 million -- or the populations of Iowa or Missouri, respectively -- and even pundits have been reticent to predict their voting behavior. That said, there are a number of reasons to believe that, if the election were to be decided by expatriates, President Barack Obama would have a lot to smile about.The expatriate and traveling community is, first and foremost, wildly diverse. Though it has historically been broken down into two parts, military and non-military, the non-military segment now includes -- to name just a few -- business people, NGO workers, students studying abroad, those married to foreign spouses, wanderers and missionaries. These people live in small African villages, Asian megalopolises, tense Middle Eastern cities and many other places around the world.These communities, according to Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat of the Overseas Vote Foundation, a nonpartisan group working to make voting from abroad easier, are influential in how overseas Americans make their voting decisions.""It would be wrong to suggest that Americans' votes are not influenced by their host countries,"" Dzieduszycka-Suinat said. ""Expats have experiences like using universal health care and feeling the effects of foreign policy that inform how they think. There aren't polls of expat voters but polls of other countries can be indicative.""Those polls have strongly favored Obama. The president would win by a 96 percent margin in France, an 82 percent margin in Germany and a 66 percent margin in the U.K., according to a recent Marshall Fund study. In fact, the only country that supported Mitt Romney in a recent poll of foreigners taken by MSN was China, a country the Republican presidential nominee has criticized time and again over the course of the campaign.Vicki Hansen, the Vice Chair of Democrats Abroad and an Iowa voter, puts the effect of cultural immersion in stark terms: ""Anyone living, working, serving or studying overseas understands that the US is much more respected now in 2012 than in 2008. Obama will win.""But being surrounded by Obama's international fans doesn't necessarily turn Americans toward the Democratic Party or, for that matter, prompt them to take part in elections at all. Despite what Dzieduszycka-Suinat describes as this administration's ""commitment to making voting from abroad easier"" for expats and troops, she expects only about one million voters to send in absentee ballots. She blames this on voters' lack of desire to go through the relatively simple process created by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, which she says is more intimidating to some than it should be, but still ""certainly easier than voting in Florida."" But despite Dzieduszycka-Suinat's assertion, some overseas Americans have already reported having difficulty voting.This lack of enthusiasm for voting among expats is mirrored by the dearth of donations from abroad. According to an analysis of FEC Filings undertaken by the Center for Responsive Politics, the two presidential candidates had only received some $1.1 million in donations from expats as of August. Obama took in 70 percent of that total, and Romney's donations came predominantly from the U.K. and Hong Kong, two international banking centers. If these numbers illustrate a Romney enthusiasm gap, that gap is also evident among overseas military personel, who gave far more to Obama's campaign than to Romney's. Those donations somewhat undercut the notion that military voters lean toward the Republican candidate.But leaping to the conclusion that the experience of life abroad somehow makes voters more liberal doesn't factor in a crucial fact: the traveling community is extremely self-selecting.The states that boast the highest percentage of passport holders are Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, California and Alaska, all of them solidly blue except the chilly, non-contiguous one. A map of America by passport holder percentage, it turns out, looks a great deal like the electoral map, with Texas and Arizona being major and somewhat obvious exceptions.The Atlantic's Richard Florida, in parsing passport data, found that it correlated with knowledge-based employment, education and income. Travelers are, in short, representative of a predictable slice of America, a fact that is obviously a double-edged sword for Obama during an election: If expats are the tiebreaker, he'll likely win, but if those expats were at home, he wouldn't need a tiebreaker.This cultural schism is also clearly evident in expat culture.""If you look at 'retail' politics -- phone banking, canvassing, voter registration drives, rallies, etc. -- I think you'll find that Democrats Abroad are much more enthusiastic and organized than our Republican friends,"" said Robert Carolina, a UK-based lawyer who works with Democrats Abroad, the official arm of the Democratic Party in the United Kingdom. ""Anecdotal evidence from our campaign activities suggests that President Obama enjoys a warm base of support among our fellow Americans here.""In foreign cities, it's not uncommon for Democratic clubs to be popular cultural centers for young expats and NGO workers eager to network and meet local other non-locals. Republican clubs can be harder to find.According to Cynthia Dillon, Republicans Abroad -- which, unlike its Democratic counterpart, is not an official part of the Republican Party -- is hoping that its economic message, coupled with anger over the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which requires foreign banks to report American account holders to the IRS, will change expats' minds about the president.""It is my opinion that partially because of FATCA and the dire economic situation in the US with repercussions everywhere... Americans abroad will have voted for the Romney-Ryan ticket that promises to help rebuild the economy at home,"" said Dillon, who joins Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus in suspecting that some of Obama's donations from abroad are coming from foreign nationals.Whether or not Republican expats become the mouse that roared -- as they did in 2000 when Al Gore would have taken Florida if not for 2,490 overseas ballots counted after Election Day -- remains unclear and depends on the swing states in play. In the unlikely event the election comes down to Florida, the state's registered voters in Israel could turn the election, but if the voting comes down states like Colorado, Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin and New Hampshire, Obama would likely have the edge.What is absolutely certain is that this overlooked group won't be so overlooked again if their votes sway the election. If that should happen, this could well be the last presidential race before American political ads begin running during the halftime of Real Madrid games."
6,MONEY,Mold Damage From Sandy Is Not Likely Covered By Insurance: Report,Caroline Fairchild,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mold-damage-sandy-insurance_us_5b9c7c5ae4b03a1dcc7f18b8,Whether or not mold damage is covered in your homeowners insurance depends on what caused the mold and what policy coverage,2012-11-06,"Water flows past debris from a destroyed home Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2012, in Mantoloking N.J. Hurricane Sandy caused the ocean to cut a channel through to the bay, shown flowing here, which effectively cut the borough in two. Most of the multimillion-dollar homes along this old-money stretch of the Jersey shore were seriously damaged by pounding surf, wild wind and, in some cases, fire from ruptured gas lines. Numerous homes were destroyed, and some were obliterated, leaving behind just empty sand or maybe a few broken pilings jutting up out of the surf. (AP Photo/Wayne Parry)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c7c5a240000500094b21e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amidst the power outages, gas shortages, mass transit shutdowns and school closures left behind in Superstorm Sandy's wake, there's one issue few people are talking about, and that's the cost that homeowners will incur from mold damage. Aside from the health risks associated with mold from flooding, mold removal is extremely costly and is not covered by most home insurance policies, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The average homeowner could be forced to shell out anywhere from $200 to $30,000 for mold removal. In a recent report on Sandy's destruction obtained by Business Insider, Citi strategist Jeffrey Berenbaum wrote, ""mold damage could likely be the largest risk to properties that remain flooded for weeks.""After a natural disaster like Sandy, homes, offices and most enclosed areas that were flooded are at risk of growing bacteria and mold, the New Rochelle Patch reports. If you had water in your house for at least 48 hours, you can expect to find mold growth, according to Newsday. A musty odor or water stains could indicate that your home is infected with mold, according to the Portchester Patch. Discoloration of the ceiling or walls and warping of the floor are also some of the tell-tale signs as well. Whether or not mold damage is covered in your homeowners insurance depends on what caused the mold and what policy coverage you have, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance. Some insurance companies have take extra measures to limit their exposure to mold claims with some policies going as far as to have mold exclusions, meaning they don’t cover any costs associated with mold damage or removal. Even if your insurance does cover damage from mold, there is usually a limit placed on mold-related expenses. For around $47 more a year, an additional $50,000 in mold coverage costs can be included in the typical homeowners insurance plan, Bill Wilson, of the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, estimates. To find out if mold is covered by your insurer, it is best to read through your policy.If you think your home has been infected with mold, the Monmouth County Information Office in New Jersey recommends you take an inventory of missing and damage goods, remove wet carpeting right away and clean all hard surfaces.  According to Trulia, the cost of mold removal depends on the amount of damaged materials and the length of time it will take to complete the job. The high cost of mold removal after natural disasters is something that Americans have had to deal with before. In 2006 after floods hit the U.S., the Federal Reserve had to take action against businesses who were unfairly increasing the price on services like mold removal. For New Jersey residents who are currently in the process of cleaning up their homes, the Department of Health is making public health experts available by phone to answer any questions about mold removal, the Collingswood Patch writes. The Department of Health also has a list on its website of approved environmental consultants who can assess the cost of mold removal and damage to your home. "

But wholesale opposition to genetic modification makes far less sense.",2012-11-06,"A picture taken on August 22, 2012 in Godewaersvelde, northern France shows a corn field. AFP PHOTO PHILIPPE HUGUEN (Photo credit should read PHILIPPE HUGUEN/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c7c502100003000c524ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's Election Day, 2012 -- and there is a clear and fundamental choice before us. Well, there is if you live in California -- because that's where you get to vote today for, or against, Proposition 37.Proposition 37 calls for mandatory labeling of genetically modified food. There is, inevitably, some devilry in the details of what gets labeled when, and how -- but fundamentally, were this proposition to become law, companies would be obligated to declare any willful or known incorporation of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in their products.There seems little basis for opposition to an initiative that is, ostensibly, just about transparency. Proposition 37 wouldn't ban anything -- it would just tell people what's what. But there is opposition, just as there is opposition to mandatory calorie counts on menu boards, or the honest disclosure of overall nutritional quality. The food industry is evidently concerned that knowledge truly is power, and will influence consumer choice.But the issue really runs deeper, I think. While Proposition 37 is just about labeling, the topic of genetically modified foods is buffeted by deep passions from the one side, and deep profits from the other. Images of scientists inserting eye-of-newt genes into escarole, or wool-of-bat genes into walnuts, stalk the nightmares of pure food proponents, and up to a point, rightly so. Even if the intentions of those tinkering with foods are good -- such as putting antifreeze genes from amphibians into oranges so they are not destroyed by an early frost -- the law of unintended consequences pertains. There is ample reason, in principle, to be wary of Frankenfoods.There may be reason in epidemiology as well. We are substantially uncertain about why rates of gluten intolerance and celiac disease are rising; genetic modification of food may be a factor. Some go so far as to declare modern wheat a ""poison,"" lest sugar get all that negative attention! Genetic modification may be a factor, as well, in everything from food allergies, to irritable bowel syndrome, to behavioral and cognitive disorders occurring with increasing frequency in our children.The food industry's richly funded assault on Proposition 37 is almost certainly about more than the inconvenience of mandatory disclosure, and probably about more than what such disclosure may do to consumer choice. Monsanto and other companies with skin in this game are no doubt concerned that Proposition 37 is the first salvo in an all-out barrage directed at GMOs. Certainly opponents of GMOs in our food supply would like more than labeling; they would like this putatively malevolent genie back in its bottle.I understand that yearning, but I can't entirely share it. Despite the fact that I have no particular love for Monsanto, and despite the fact that the companies supporting Proposition 37 are some of my favorites on the planet -- among them, the very companies that feed me and my family every day -- I feel we need a more balanced perspective on this topic.Genetic modification is not all bad. There, I've said it.Without it, we would not have broccoli or navel oranges. We would not have pink grapefruits. We would not have amaranth or quinoa. And for that that matter, we would not have our dogs, our tea roses, or -- arguably -- our children. Opposition to genetic modification comes easy in principle, but is a slippery, treacherous, obstacle-strewn slope in practice. If we consider sexual reproduction a form of genetic modification, and in literal terms it certainly is, then we have been in the practice since before our species was a species. Natural selection is a process of genetic modification.If we limit the definition to willful manipulation of gene combinations to produce specific, intentional effects -- we have still been at it since the very dawn of agriculture and the domestication of the wolf.Virtually none of the produce that now constitutes the most nutritious part of our diets existed before the dawn of agriculture only 12,000 or so years ago. Whole grains, which are a mainstay ingredient for some of the companies most adamantly opposed to GMOs, did not exist in their current form and were not part of the human diet prior to that same, recent revolution.To some extent, arguments against all genetic modification represent a longing for an elusive kind of food purity. But arguments for such purity tend to devolve under scrutiny. To paraphrase, one proponent's purity is another's contamination.Some purists argue that our grains should all be unrefined, and free of genetic modification. But another band of purists points out that our Stone Age ancestors did not eat grains at all. And, furthermore, the grains we consume today are all a product of genetic modification of the selective type. We didn't tinker with genomes in test tubes until recently -- but we did it in the dirt long before. If we adopt the most restrictive definition of genetic modification and say it refers only to combining genes from different breeds that would not normally mingle in nature, we have still been at it for millennia, in the form of horticultural grafting -- which is said to have begun around 2000 B.C. in China. Monsanto had no shareholders at the time.If the basic objection here is to bringing genes together in an ""artificial"" manner, then the same objection should apply to in vitro fertilization, and dog breeding. Our dogs are products of willful genetic modification. It wasn't done in test tubes -- it was done in the wombs of bitches. But it is genetic modification just the same. Frankly, I'm glad for it. Two of my best friends on the planet -- Zouzou, our Yorkie, and Bramble, our Sheltie -- are products of it. They don't much resemble wolves, and genetic modification is the reason.Perhaps the fundamental objection is to mingling genes from different species. But almost anything in a nursery that says ""hybrid,"" such as hybrid tea roses, indicates that different plants were mated to create a ""blended"" offspring with the desirable traits of both parents. We have this to thank for many of the wines we drink, the diverse colors of roses and tulips that grace our gardens, and so on.Our own bodies are a mix of genes from different species. Normal human physiology is a product of native DNA, and the DNA of innumerable foreign bacteria that populate our inner and outer surfaces. We can take the argument a step further than that, a step inside our own cells, where our mitochondria reside. Mitochondria are the energy generators of our bodies. They are a fixed, essential part of us -- but they have a distinct set of genes. They are, emphatically, the insertion of genes from one species into another. That is classically genetic modification. Admittedly, it is naturally occurring. But tempting though that tack may be, it quickly degenerates into the contention that nature is good, and science is bad. That, of course, is just silly.Science can go badly awry, of course, and certainly has. But it can do -- and has done -- enormous good. Nature can be bountiful and beneficent. But anyone paying attention must concede she can at times also be downright nasty.Smallpox virus is a product of nature; smallpox vaccine, a product of science. Ditto for rabies, and polio.Genetic modification is a product of both. Nature modified our genes to protect us from malaria, for instance. And, just as it can be with human-mediated genetic modification, the law of unintended consequences was invoked. We wound up with the misery of sickle cell anemia.There are other forces to consider here. Anyone opposed to GMOs should be donating routinely to Planned Parenthood, because we can't feed 10 billion of us, or 12, without crop yields buoyed by genetic modification. Population growth, unfettered, will give Monsanto several billion more reasons to make fortunes. So will climate change, as the planet becomes ever less hospitable to the crops we know and love. And, frankly, so will eating animal products -- since that is vastly less efficient use of the sun's energy than eating plants directly.Genetic modifications can increase yields, reduce use of chemical pesticides, lower costs, and/or foster tolerance of drought, heat, or frost. If the matter is on trial, both prosecution and defense arguments are warranted before a rational verdict can be reached. If I lived in California, I would vote for Proposition 37; it makes sense to be informed. But wholesale opposition to genetic modification makes far less sense. Good and bad can result from the machinations of both nature and science, and from the genetic modifications endowed by each. The right effort is directed not at carte blanche endorsement, or stem-to-stern renunciation, but at distinguishing the bad from the good.Our great big Homo sapien brains are themselves a product of genetic modification, albeit of a naturally occurring variety. We need them to get past passions and profiteering alike, to balance, and the innumerable practical advantages of genetically modified... perspective.-finDavid Katz, M.D., is taking questions from readers this week to answer in his next blog post.
