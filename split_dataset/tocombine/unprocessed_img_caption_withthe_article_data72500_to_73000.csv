Black Lives Matter demonstrators have set up an encampment at the precinct which is near the site of the Sunday shooting of Jamar Clark by a Minneapolis police officer. Clark has been taken off life support. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An unarmed black man shot Sunday night by Minneapolis police has died, and activists are calling for police to release videos of the incident that led to his death. Jamar Clark, 24, had been on life support since the shooting. After his family removed him from life support, he died Monday evening, the Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, a division of the Department of Public Safety, confirmed to The Huffington Post. Clark was shot Sunday night during an apparent struggle with police. The BCA said paramedics called police to report an individual interfering with an assault victim they were trying to aid; after an ""altercation"" with the individual, of of the officers fired at least one shot.But witness accounts differ drastically from the police version of events. ""That man was shot in cold blood when he had his hands behind his back,"" witness Keisha Steele told the Associated Press. Witness accounts saying Clark was handcuffed at the time of the shooting sparked anger in the community and calls for police to release video of the shooting. On Monday evening, protesters blocked Interstate 94 for about two and a half hours. At least 43 adults were arrested during the peaceful protest. BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said in a Tuesday press conference that authorities had several partial videos of the incident -- none of which came from police body cameras or patrol dashboard cameras -- but that they would not release any of it while the investigation was ongoing. ""We don't want to taint the interviews that may be ongoing with witnesses in this case,"" Evans said. ""And by having this video going public, we may potentially taint portions of the investigation."" The Hennepin County Coroner's Office released its autopsy report Tuesday, ruling that Clark died from a gunshot wound to the head, and called the manner of death a homicide under investigation by the BCA and the FBI.Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges has called for a federal investigation into Clark's shooting. The two responding officers have been placed on leave, per department protocol, according to the BCA. On Wednesday, the BCA identified the officers as seven-year police veterans Officer Mark Ringgenberg and Officer Dustin Schwarze.We need to know exactly what happened,"" Minneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau said in a press conference Tuesday. ""We need to know the truth. Everyone involved needs that and deserves that.""At least 1,000 people have been killed by law enforcement this year, according to the Guardian database that tracks police killings. "
1,POLITICS,Lawmakers Sneak Help For White-Collar Criminals Into Justice Reform Bill,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/corporate-crime-criminal-justice-reform_us_564cc371e4b031745cef33d4,"Finally, some good news for CEOs.",2015-11-18,Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) are backing a bill that would eliminate many corporate crimes based negligent or reckless behavior.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564cc4021600002d0026dad1.jpeg?cache=uUaZiEdqHp&ops=crop_254_0_1985_1277%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday injected a controversial effort to curb prosecutions of white-collar crime into a bipartisan push for criminal justice reform.The panel approved a slate of several bills that will likely be packaged together on the House floor. But while public debate over the issue has focused on reducing severe sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, the Judiciary Committee added a new component aimed at reducing criminal prosecutions of corporate officers. Influential conservatives including the Koch brothers and the Heritage Foundation have argued in favor of curbing corporate prosecutions. The corporate malfeasance piece would eliminate a host of current white-collar criminal offenses due to reckless, negligent or grossly negligent activity. Instead, prosecutors would have to prove that corporate officials knew criminal activity was taking place and knew it to be illegal. The bill was authored by Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), and its co-sponsors include Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the top-ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas).The Department of Justice, however, has sharply criticized the plan approved by the Judiciary Committee. DOJ spokesman Peter Carr told The Huffington Post the legislation ""would create confusion and needless litigation, and significantly weaken, often unintentionally, countless federal statutes,"" including ""those that play an important role in protecting the public welfare ... protecting consumers from unsafe food and medicine.""During the mark-up hearing, Conyers and Jackson-Lee acknowledged that the Center for American Progress, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the American Bar Association have all raised concerns about their bill, and promised to work to find a productive compromise. Conyers suggested the legislation would curb prosecutions for actions that damage the environment or jeopardize food safety.The bill cleared the committee by a voice vote without any amendments addressing complaints.Big corporations can diffuse responsibility for illegal activity across a complex organization, which can make it difficult for prosecutors to prove that executives knowingly and willfully violated the law -- even when it is obvious that the law was, in fact, broken. CEOs can also pressure lower-level employees to violate the law without explicitly telling them to do so -- by, say, demanding profits or other results that are impossible to reach without breaking the law. Under current law, prosecutors can bring cases on the grounds that such behavior by executives is criminally reckless or negligent, even if they cannot prove the CEO was actually aware that underlings were breaking the law to meet impossible metrics.Consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen assailed the white-collar crime bill when it was unveiled on Monday.""There is absolutely no reason for the otherwise laudable criminal justice reform bill to contain any measure to weaken already feeble standards for corporate criminal prosecution,"" Public Citizen President Robert Weissman said in a written statement.The Senate Judiciary Committee approved its own criminal justice legislation in October. The Senate package did not include the House maneuvering on white-collar crime, although Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) had pressed to include similar measures.Zach Carter is The Huffington Post's senior political economy reporter and a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast ""So That Happened.""

And in 2010, another fossilized tooth was found.Since the discoveries, the species has remained somewhat of a mystery. However, a new analysis of one of the molars, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is offering unprecedented insight into the strange species. The research shows that they may have interbred with Neanderthals, early Homo sapiens, and possibly even another group of ancient hominins that has yet to be identified.""Together with Neanderthals, their sister group in western Asia and Europe, they are the closest relatives of all people alive today,"" Svante Pääbo, geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and a co-author of the research, told The Huffington Post in an email. ""So they are one of our closest relatives, but not our ancestors.""Pääbo and his colleagues extracted DNA from the tooth, called Denisova 8, by using a sterile dentistry drill to take out a few milligrams of material from the fossil. They then sequenced the DNA found in the molar.The researchers were surprised to discover that Denisova 8 dates back as far 110,000 years, making it much older than the other molar and finger fossils, which are about 50,000 years old.""One of the three individuals we studied lived perhaps as much as 60,000 years earlier than the other two individuals,"" Pääbo said. ""This shows that the Denisovans were present in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia over a very long time, or at least that they were there periodically, over a long time.""Scientists also believe that the Denisovans may have traveled further south beyond southern Siberia, and evidence of this migration is seen today as pieces of DNA identical to Denisovan DNA can be found in modern-day New Guineans, Polynesians, Australian Aborigines, and other Asian populations, ""For example in Tibet where an adaption to live at high altitudes where there is little oxygen in the air has been shown to come from Denisovans,"" Pääbo said. The researchers also found in the DNA analysis some clues about who the Denisovans interbred with, including a lesser known branch of the human family tree not yet identified by scientists or from fossils, Science magazine reported.""If you would have told me five years ago I would be talking about [a] species we don’t have any fossils for, I would have thought you were crazy,"" Dr. Todd Disotell, a molecular anthropologist at New York University, who was not involved in the new research, told The New York Times.Scientists believe that Neanderthals and Denisovans diverged from modern humans on the human family tree 400,000 years ago, according to the Times, and as each species evolved there is growing evidence that they interacted.""Denisovans were quite diverse genetically, much more so than Neanderthals,"" Dr. Bence Viola, paleoanthropologist at the University of Toronto and a co-author of the research, told HuffPost. Such diversity suggests that there must have been many Denisovans over quite a long time.""The world at that time must have been far more complex than previously thought,"" Susanna Sawyer, geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and lead author of the research, told National Geographic. ""Who knows what other hominids lived and what effects they had on us?"" The researchers hope to find more Denisovan fossil specimens, which may help to unravel more details about our early relatives.""We hope that when we now publish the features of these teeth others will recognize similar teeth from other sites that may be from Denisovans,"" Pääbo said.Also on HuffPost:"

But it is routine business for bats, and now scientists have learned precisely how they do it.Researchers using high-speed cameras to observe bats in a special flight enclosure said on Monday these flying mammals exploit the extra mass of their wings, which are heavy for their body size compared to those of birds and insects, in order to perform the upside-down landing.They land that way in order to roost, as bats do, upside down on cave ceilings or under tree limbs.Brown University scientists observed two species: Seba's short-tailed bat and the lesser dog-faced fruit bat. They tracked their motions using three synchronized high-speed video cameras taking images at 1,000 frames per second, and studied weight distribution in the bats' body and wings.They found that by flapping both wings while folding one of them just a bit toward their body, a bat can shift its center of mass to perform a midair flip in order to alight on a ceiling.""Flying animals all maneuver constantly as they negotiate a three-dimensional environment,"" Brown biology and engineering professor Sharon Swartz said. ""Bats employ this specific maneuver every time they land, because for a bat, landing requires reorienting from head forward, back up, belly down, to head down, toes up.""When approaching their touchdown spot, bats are not flying very quickly, making it difficult to muster the type of aerodynamic forces generated by pushing against the air that could help position them for an upside-down landing. But their heavy wings enable them instead to generate inertial forces to reorient themselves in midair.""This is similar to the way in which divers twist and turn during a high dive,"" said Kenny Breuer, a Brown professor of engineering, ecology and evolutionary biology.Swartz said bats are generally under-appreciated as skilled aviators because they are primarily nocturnal. ""People have many opportunities to observe birds and insects flying, but the bat world is hidden in the night. The more we observe flight behavior in bats, the more we are impressed,"" Swartz said.The research was published in the journal PLOS Biology.Also on HuffPost:"

HOLLIS, N.H. -- There are many reasons why Jeb Bush has struggled as a presidential candidate. Among the most glaring is that the former Florida governor is an introvert and sometimes painfully self-aware policy wonk running in a Republican primary campaign that has rewarded the flashiest and most obstinate political newcomers in the race.But in our interview aboard his campaign bus earlier this month, we found the one-time GOP front-runner-turned-scrappy underdog to be approachable, conversational and sanguine about his chances in 2016. “I don’t fret,” Bush said. “I don’t wring my hands and go, ‘Oh, woe is me. This is so unfair.’ It’s like, let’s just get going, baby. I mean, I’m excited about this. And I believe going through tough times is a great way to show your mettle -- to show who you are. And I’m looking forward to making the comeback.” Bush opened up in a surprisingly personal manner on subjects ranging from the advice that his older brother gives him and his daughter’s struggles with drug addiction to his own deeply conflicted views on the death penalty and the meaning of life.And then there was Bush's not-to-be-missed anecdote about his off-camera conversation with Donald Trump -- which took place during a commercial break in a recent debate -- regarding the business mogul's concerns about the high cost of manufacturing his branded neckties in the United States.The terrorist attacks in Paris have sparked conjecture about whether the Republican electorate may finally end its extended dalliance with amateur hour and start looking toward candidates with the experience and stature more befitting a future world leader and commander in chief.Our day on the trail with Bush occurred before the Paris attacks, but one thing was abundantly clear even then: Bush has no plans to call it quits.“It’s dogged, dogged, dogged determination -- never giving up,” he said. “It’s doing the little things over and over again when no one’s watching. That’s how you win.”Watch the video above for the latest installment of the HuffPost series '16 And President.Story by Scott Conroy.

But too many times, the 'T' in LGBT has been an afterthought,"" LGBT Equality Caucus Co-Chair Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) said at a press conference at the Capitol Tuesday morning. Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.) will chair the new task force, the first launched by the LGBT Equality Caucus. It will be composed of seven Democratic members and one Republican -- Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), whose son is transgender.Honda is the self-described ""proud grandpa"" of Malisa, his 8-year-old transgender granddaughter whom he tweeted about in February.""The violence against the transgender community is a national crisis,"" Honda said. ""Far too often, they face harassment, discrimination or violence for simply being who they are. ... After 21 deaths of transgender individuals because of violence this year alone, Congress must take notice and act.""This year's killings of at least 21 transgender people -- primarily women of color -- were a focus of the press conference Tuesday. Legislators pointed to these deaths as examples of the urgent need for more awareness and measures that will advance equality. The number is the highest since advocates began tracking reported U.S. homicides of transgender individuals in 2006, according to the Human Rights Campaign.Several of the transgender speakers at the event had their own harrowing stories to tell about facing violence and discrimination over the years. Laya Monarez, now a staffer with HRC, transitioned in 2009. Facing discrimination, she left her job as an art teacher and assumed she would be able to find a new one. But no one would hire her, and she soon ran out of money.""I turned to the streets and relied on couches and the kindness of others to survive,"" she recounted Tuesday. ""There, I met violence head-on. Every night was a night that may have been my last. In my experience to survive, I have been raped, assaulted at gunpoint, stabbed multiple times, forced to jump from a moving car to escape my attacker.""""But it wasn't just on the streets that I faced violence. It was everywhere,"" she added. ""There have been times that I have been harassed simply because someone saw me and thought I was transgender. I was once even chased in the middle of the day by someone threatening to kill me with a broken glass bottle. To be clear, I'm the one who needs protection in the bathroom.""The task force's launch comes just weeks after a blow to the LGBT rights movement. Earlier this month, Houston voters overwhelmingly rejected a comprehensive nondiscrimination measure. Conservative opponents focused the fight on the protections for sexual orientation and gender identity, adopting the slogan ""No men in women's bathrooms"" and playing up fears that passage could lead to male sexual predators dressing up as women and entering women's restrooms. (Like Monarez said, transgender individuals are far more likely to face harassment in restrooms.)But none of the more than a dozen speakers mentioned the Houston loss Tuesday, except passingly as evidence of the work that needs to be done. LGBT Equality Caucus Executive Director Roddy Flynn told The Huffington Post that the launch of the task force had been in the works for months, before the Houston legislation's failure, although the outcome of that vote showed the need for such measures.At the congressional forum Tuesday afternoon, transgender rights activists -- some of whom are transgender and have experienced targeted violence themselves -- stressed that it was important to increase education around gender identity issues. ""Ignorance is not benign,"" said Catherine Hyde, who has a transgender daughter and is the director of Atlanta's chapter of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People. She recounted how a psychologist was concerned that her son, before he transitioned, was playing with tutus and Barbies. Hyde said the psychologist, ""who did not understand,"" encouraged them to ""allow only boy toys and clothing, supposedly helping."" ""Two years later, our 6-year-old was threatening with suicide,"" Hyde said. A member of the police force also spoke on how the law enforcement community can improve its treatment of transgender individuals and educate itself on the violence directed at the community.Major Irene Burks of the police force in Prince George’s County, Maryland, said such improvement would begin with law enforcement agencies acknowledging ""their role in injustices and discrimination."" Burks suggested law enforcement start nationally tracking violence against transgender individuals. Then, she said, strategies, training programs and policies could be informed and created to ""best meet the needs of the agency, as well as the transgender community."" In addition to the task force, Congress will hold a historic forum Tuesday afternoon on transgender issues. The event will feature nearly a dozen panelists talking about the impact and causes of violence against the community, as well as policies and solutions to address the problem.In July, a group of lawmakers introduced the Equality Act, which would update federal law to provide nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people. The White House recently endorsed it, but it hasn't moved anywhere in Congress. All panelists at the afternoon forum stressed that, ultimately, the passage of federal anti-discrimination legislation was an imperative remedy to the transgender community's suffering. ""Every day that goes by where trans people lack federal protections and the full rights and privileges of citizenship is a day where the state failed to recognize the humanity of trans people,"" said Joanna Cifredo, a transgender writer, advocate and organizer, who has personally survived gender-based violence.HRC and the Trans People of Color Coalition recently released a report shedding light on victims' stories and highlighting data on and solutions to the issue of violence against the transgender community.This article has been updated with comments from Catherine Hyde, Irene Burks and Joanna Cifredo.Also on HuffPost:"

Chris Christie (R), who has said he doesn't think the United States should take in refugees fleeing from war-torn Syria -- not even if they're ""orphans under the age of five."" ""Because Chris Christie is an elected official, his comment is an embarrassment to this country,"" de Blasio said Tuesday. ""If he were in any other profession, it would be dismissed out of hand for the callous, heartless and prejudiced statement that it is.""De Blasio affirmed that Syrian refugees are welcome in New York, the home of Ellis Island.""We should not close our borders to any group of people fleeing the atrocities and horrors of terrorism. To do so is to hand terrorists a victory over our democracy, strengthened over the years by Americans who died or risked their lives for it,"" he said. ""New York City is a proud immigrant city, and we will not turn our back on that history or the people being persecuted and fleeing war."" A spokesman for Christie, who is running for president, did not immediately return a request for comment.Nearly half of the nation's governors have called on the United States to stop admitting Syrian refugees in the wake of last week's terrorist attacks in Paris, with many of them promising to prevent refugees from entering their states -- even though they don't actually have the legal authority to do so. De Blasio also criticized GOP presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump, who on Monday suggested closing down mosques. Trump faulted de Blasio for shuttering a New York Police Department program last year that conducted surveillance on Muslim communities. ""First and foremost, we always will abide by the U.S. Constitution which prohibits discrimination against religions. We will adhere to the words of our Founding Fathers, not Donald Trump,"" de Blasio said. ""Mosques don't commit acts of terrorism. People do. NYPD will investigate the crime, not close down places of worship.""Cities United For Immigration Action, a coalition of nearly 100 mayors, municipalities and counties -- of which de Blasio is a member -- put out a statement Tuesday welcoming Syrian refugees and distancing itself from the governors. ""As municipal leaders, we seek always to protect our communities, while we honor the diversity and growth of our cities and counties,"" read the statement. ""The United States has a robust screening and background check system that ensures our safety and security is protected, as we welcome those in need of refuge onto our shores.""According to the State Department, only 2 percent of the Syrian refugees who have been admitted into the United States are ""military-aged"" men without families. Women and children make up two-thirds of the Syrian refugee population worldwide. Also on HuffPost: "

John Conyers (D-Mich.) asked Lynch at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday if she believed the discussion happening around the nation in the wake of high-profile police killings has made people less safe.""Our discussion about civil rights and the appropriate use of force and all police tactics can only serve to make all of us -- community members and police officers -- safer,"" Lynch said.

Lynch's comments follow FBI Director James Comey's remarks last month that social media was worsening the divide between law enforcement and citizens and that viral videos had sent a ""chill wind"" through law enforcement that could result in an uptick in crime.Comey said he'd talked to officers in one major city who felt ""under siege"" and didn't ""feel much like getting out of their cars.""

In 2014, the conservative nonprofit reported to the Federal Election Commission that it spent $26 million on express electoral efforts to defeat congressional Democrats.Aside from its own direct spending on elections, Crossroads GPS directed $13.6 million to other groups aiding Republican campaigns in 2014. None of the original donors aiding these Republican campaigns through Crossroads GPS are required to be disclosed.This included entirely funding the nonprofit group Carolina Rising with a $4.8 million donation. As reported by the Center for Responsive Politics, Carolina Rising spent all of its money promoting Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) in his successful campaign to unseat Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan.Carolina Rising was not the only group involved in the North Carolina Senate race funded by Crossroads GPS. The American Future Fund received $2 million from Crossroads GPS and spent $420,000 on advertisements touting North Carolina Libertarian Party candidate Sean Haugh’s support for legalizing marijuana and his anti-war stance. The ads were designed to appeal to young voters that Republicans wanted to steer away from voting for Hagan.Haugh was not pleased with the intervention, although his enmity was slightly misplaced. “While I appreciate the support, I now have a whole new reason to despise Koch brothers & their dark money,” he tweeted after the ads went up. American Future Fund had previously taken money from the political network operated by the billionaire Koch brothers.Another $390,000 from Crossroads GPS went to the nonprofit group Kentucky Opportunity Coalition. This group spent all its money to support and promote Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in his successful 2014 re-election campaign against both his tea party-backed primary opponent, Matt Bevin (now governor-elect of Kentucky), and his general election opposition from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes. It is not at all surprising that Crossroads GPS would fund Kentucky Opportunity Coalition. They are both run by Steven Law, a former aide to McConnell, and connections between the two groups were apparent while the campaign was underway.Crossroads GPS also sent $5.2 million to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobby and a major political force in the Republican Party. Other contributions included $900,000 to National Right to Life; $125,000 to the National Rifle Association; $50,000 to Ethics & Public Policy Center; $50,000 to The John Hay Initiative; and $40,000 to Center for Individual Freedom.While Crossroads GPS is not required to disclose its donors, it did reveal the number and size of each contribution it received. The nonprofit group raised $69 million from 68 listed donations. Eighty percent of those funds came from just 11 donations each of $1 million or more. The largest two donations to the group were $20.6 million and $14.5 million."

It spent $28.5 million on its own activities and paid $13.3 million in salaries for its well-compensated managers.Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, which is registered as a 501(c)(6) trade association, serves mainly as a fundraising portal to distribute money from its 200-plus donors to conservative political groups. As a nonprofit, it's not required to -- and doesn't -- disclose its donors.Its ostensible mission, according to the tax form, is to ""advance its members' common business interests by advancing the principles of free markets and a free society."" But Freedom Partners' money is spread well beyond business advocacy.Three-quarters of the money Freedom Partners distributed last year went to other groups in the Koch network. Americans for Prosperity, the largest and most active political nonprofit founded by the Kochs, received the most: $22 million. Generation Opportunity, a nonprofit focused on the millennial vote, received $14.2 million. Concerned Veterans for America, a veterans group launched by the Kochs, got $12.7 million. Freedom Partners also sent $9.7 million to the Center for Shared Services Trust, $5.7 million to the Evangchr4 Trust -- which aims to disseminate and apply Biblical principles -- and $2.4 million to the American Energy Alliance.Outside the Koch constellation of nonprofits, Freedom Partners gave $4.9 million to the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action -- another seemingly unusual choice for a nonprofit dedicated to advancing business interests. It also sent more than $1 million to Citizenlink, the political nonprofit arm of the anti-gay marriage and anti-abortion evangelical group Focus on the Family, and $225,000 to the Susan B. Anthony Group, another anti-abortion organization. In the past, the EvangChr4 Trust has sent along all of its money to Citizenlink as well. Last December, David Koch said that he personally is in favor of same-sex marriage and abortion rights, but added that he's ""really focused intensely on economic and fiscal issues.""During last year's primary season, Freedom Partners contributed to groups on both sides of the Republican Party's internal battles. It gave $2 million to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which tended to support GOP incumbents against primary challengers, and $1 million to the Club for Growth, which funded a number of those challengers. Heritage Action for America, another group advocating for the challengers, received $150,000.The tax filing resolves one question left over from those primary fights: The Kochs were indeed behind Trees of Liberty, a nonprofit that intervened in the Iowa Republican primary against businessman Mark Jacobs. The $400,000 that Trees of Liberty received from Freedom Partners was part of an effort by the Koch network to help now-Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) secure the party's nomination, as previously reported by Politico.Colorado nonprofits that helped defeat then-Sen. Mark Udall (D) in 2014 were also the beneficiaries of Koch funds. Freedom Partners gave $95,000 to IACE Action and $50,000 to the Colorado Women's Alliance. Both groups worked to counter the Udall campaign's attacks on his opponent, now-Sen. Cory Gardner (R), for his opposition to abortion rights. Udall said during the campaign that Gardner would threaten women's access to birth control, something that Gardner denied. IACE Action ran radio ads criticizing Udall for his birth control comments, and the Colorado Women's Alliance launched a public relations initiative on the issue. Other beneficiaries of Freedom Partners' funds included American Commitment ($400,000), the Dr. Joseph Warren Institute ($309,400), Americans for Tax Reform ($100,000), the Illinois Chamber of Commerce ($100,000), the Main Street Growth Project ($100,000) and the Ohio Freedom Project ($50,000).As noted, none of the original donors to Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce were named. The Kochs' complicated web of nonprofit groups is designed to funnel money into elections while limiting disclosure of donors.Many of the groups in the network are registered as 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofits with the Internal Revenue Service. By law, they must spend the majority of their time and funds on their stated social welfare purpose, but they commonly argue that means 49 percent of their resources can go to explicitly electoral activities. These groups often spend even more targeting candidates through so-called issue ads that stop short of calling for the individual's election or defeat, but manage to paint a politically resonant picture nonetheless. Groups like Americans for Prosperity and Concerned Veterans for America spent millions in the lead-up to the 2014 election on issue ads attacking the most vulnerable Democratic senators.Non-disclosed spending by political nonprofits, commonly known as ""dark money,"" has surged since the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision opened the door to unlimited election spending by corporations, unions and wealthy individuals."
