Coach & Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/love-and-relationships_us_5b9da6bde4b03a1dcc8ad08d,"All those open letters telling you how to talk to women better? Maybe we could take some time learning how to listen to your quiet, how to learn from being with you instead of throwing words at every problem.",2013-11-08,2013-11-08-Vitruvian_Man_by_Leonardo_Da_Vinci_small.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-11-08-Vitruvian_Man_by_Leonardo_Da_Vinci_small-thumb.png,"I could write this as an open letter, but there are already enough of those telling you what you should do differently. I used to read some of these ""open letters to men"" and ""open letters to women"" trying to bridge the gaps between how we see things, but ultimately, most of them amount to kicking around old stereotypes and blame. Let's write each other some closed letters instead. Write down what we really feel, seal it up and send it. This one, though, is a love letter -- a thank-you note. I have learned so much from you, from those of you I have loved, those of you I do love, those of you I will love.I've learned that being a man can't be summed up in a bulleted Internet list any more than being a woman can.I've learned that being a man is different, and not just because you have more body hair and a penis. I've learned that it's hard for you, in ways I'll never totally understand.I've learned that the world thinks you are both a villain and a hero, and that there's no in between for you (even if inside you feel like something different altogether).I've learned that ""tough guy"" is something you're taught early, that you aren't always given another option, even though it hurts when your heart gets broken and tear ducts are part of being human, not just female.I've learned that half the world thinks you're a potential rapist and the other half thinks you're an idiot -- but I know the truth.I've learned that violence isn't relegated to the Y chromosome. Hatred is part of our legacy as humans, and you want to change it as much as I do. I don't look at you across a dark parking lot and wonder if you'll rape me. I look at you and see a man, a human, a person. I see you, and not the actions of people who think that strength is derived from damaging others, who twist up sex and power together and use it as a weapon to keep from feeling.And no matter how many sitcoms they make full of bumbling idiots, I celebrate Einstein, I celebrate the many men whose minds have blown mine wide open. Because I've learned that being a man means fighting those stereotypes and rising above them. I've learned that there are as many ways for you to be brilliant as there are drops in the ocean, and listening to you talk about your ideas fascinates me.I've also learned that silence is powerful. I've learned that working side by side in the quiet can ground me, heal me, in ways that hours of therapy can't. All those open letters telling you how to talk to women better? Maybe we could take some time learning how to listen to your quiet, how to learn from being with you instead of throwing words at every problem.I've learned that you are great at fixing things. That it makes you happy. That what makes you feel joy is to fix someone else's problem. And for all the trouble it's caused, you trying to help us when what we wanted was to vent, I'm sorry. Because to find your joy in helping someone else is one of the most beautiful things I can think of. I want to learn to let you help me.I've learned that your strength isn't measured in pounds lifted or punches thrown, but of the times you restrain yourself and temper that force with precision. Strength is when instead of throwing your weight around, you hold back. You don't need to have the last word. (That's what being a bigger man is anyway.)I've learned that 10 minutes of quietly making love sometimes cuts through more bullshit than two hours of talking.I've learned that you feel awkward inside your body, too, but no one lets you talk about it. (It's okay. We all do. We're all 14 years old on the inside, and trying to learn how to dance.)And I can love you even if something silly makes you cry, even if you don't think you're strong enough, even if you feel like a failure. (I wonder can you love me even if sometimes I'm too aggressive, if sometimes I'm too opinionated, if sometimes I'm too much?)And I have learned from you that even this does not define you. That you and I are limitless. We can't fit on this page. We aren't done writing yet. And I can't wait to see what I will learn from you next.Because of all of this, and so much more, thank you. You are already a good man.Adapted from its appearance on The Good Men Project.For more by Kate Bartolotta, click here.For more on love and relationships, click here."

The boarded-up home was on a street with numerous other vacant homes and overgrown yards.

It appears on the cover of Eminem's 2000 release ""The Marshall Mathers LP,"" and makes a comeback on the cover of ""The Marshall Mathers LP 2,"" released this week. The vacant house has been up for auction through the Michigan Land Bank for months with an apparent minimum bid of $1. But just Monday, MLive reported a Tennessee woman was in the process of bidding on the home, though her offer had not yet been accepted by the Michigan Land Bank. The news site describes 28-year-old Shelly Hazlett as an ""avid Eminem fan"" who wanted to turn it into a museum dedicated to the rapper. Before falling into disrepair, the home belonged to Eminem's mother for several years, according to records obtained by the Detroit Free Press. In her book My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem, Deborah Mathers spoke fondly of the house at 19946 Dresden St.""Marshall loved it so much that he had a model of it made to take on tour with him,"" she wrote. ""Even though we'd moved a lot, he always said the house on Dresden was his childhood home.""You can see Eminem walking on a dark street past the boarded-up house at the end of his video for ""Survival,"" starting at minute 4:06.

Each year, Common Sense Media calls out the TV characters and personalities who have the most and least to offer kids and families. You'll see some familiar faces on the ""worst"" list (the Kardashians, for the third year in a row) and a few newbies, who may or may not stand the test of TV time.Even with all the new devices competing for kids' attention, regular old TV still dominates kids' screen time. That means all the characters they watch or otherwise absorb through popular culture make a big impact on kids' still-forming identities. But even the worst role models can help you start important discussions with kids about what is and isn't appropriate behavior. These talks can also help your kid become more media-savvy. Discuss the reasons why these folks get so much attention. Who makes the decisions to popularize these characters and their TV shows?1. Walter White (Bryan Cranston), Breaking BadWorst offense: Offering a confusing message of moralityMany of us here at Common Sense Media really love Walter White's character and the Breaking Bad series overall. But the more we've seen babies dressed in Walter White Halloween costumes, the more we realize what a huge impact this character has made in pop culture. So even if kids aren't actually watching the show, they're absorbing the message that when an everyday person meets tough times, drugs, murder, and sacrificing one's family is a viable, or even admirable, solution.2. Drunk History creators (Will Ferrell and Derek Waters) Worst offense: Making drunkenness look appealingNo question these folks are funny. As adults, we find the juxtaposition of history lessons and inebriated comedians quite entertaining. But for teens who watch, the message is that drinking enough alcohol to slur your words, stumble around, or throw up is hilarious.3. Abby Lee Miller, Dance Moms and Abby's Ultimate Dance CompetitionWorst offense: Encouraging unhealthy competitionBoth of Abby Lee Miller's shows purposely pit moms against moms and young dancers against one another. Not only does she use shame as a motivator for her young charges, she screams and insults their parents, too. Thanks to Miller's influence, the moms also bicker with one another and openly criticize both their own kids and others'.4. Kardashian clan, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, et al. Worst offense: Putting appearance and attention above substance and accomplishmentAlthough the family sometimes exhibits a charming loyalty among themselves, as an entity they represent some of the worst things about our culture. Kim's insistence on being in full hair and makeup while giving birth is just one example of how this family values appearance over substance. Add to that drug abuse, relationship drama, sexing up the still-underage girls in the family, and a general vapidity exhibited on the show and in the larger pop culture arena, and this family is one we really don't want to keep up with.5. Ryan Lochte, What Would Ryan Lochte Do?Worst offense: Valuing empty fame over true achievementHere is someone whose physical achievements are so great that he has the potential to be an incredible role model to kids. He could teach them about perseverance, stamina, sacrifice. But instead he chooses to seek fame in Hollywood, demonstrating to kids that being on TV, even if it puts you in an embarrassing light, is the ultimate goal. Ick. (Thankfully, his show was quickly canceled.)6. Big Ang, Miami Monkey and Mob WivesWorst offense: Wallowing in shallownessThere's something undeniably charming about Big Ang, which is probably why producers offered her a spin-off after the ridiculous Mob Wives. But there's just so much wrong with her behavior: drinking and smoking to excess, modeling an exaggerated representation of the female body (her chest and lips defy nature!), and creating a work environment that thrives off catty competition and sexed-up bodies.7. Cat (Ariana Grande), Sam & CatWorst offense: Reinforcing ""airhead"" stereotypeActress and pop singer Ariana Grande is not without talent, but her character on this spin-off of two mega-popular Nickelodeon shows (iCarly and Victorious) is the epitome of a ""dumb girl."" She speaks with an affected whispery voice, regularly misunderstands common vocabulary, and seems generally self-absorbed and, frankly, annoying. Young girls and boys who are just figuring out their identities might pick up some really confusing messages about what's funny and appealing thanks to Cat.8. Seth MacFarlane, the Oscars, Family Guy, etc.Worst offense: Humor that consistently crosses the lineAs host of the Oscars, MacFarlane stepped out from behind his offensive Family Guy characters and showed his true stripes. From a song objectifying all of Hollywood's actresses (""We Saw Your Boobs"") to jokes about Adele's weight, the comedian stood in front of an international audience and made us wonder how someone with such a warped and unkind view of humanity could be so successful.9. Eli (Seth Green), Warner (Giovanni Ribisi), Dads; and Frank (Tony Shalhoub), We Are MenWorst offense: Racism and sexism mixed togetherThese three characters from two new fall TV series represent the dark underbelly of mainstream comedy (it should be noted that Seth MacFarlane is responsible for Dads). In the Dads pilot, both Eli and Warner go along with a plot to dress up their Asian female colleague as a sexed-up schoolgirl to appeal to their Chinese clients. Ugh. And in the thankfully canceled We Are Men, the character of Frank had an unabashed preference for dating Asian women several decades younger than he was. Double ugh.10. Brickleberry characters, BrickleberryWorst offense: Offending for the sake of offendingComedy at its best teaches us something about ourselves, from South Park's skewering of political correctness to Parks and Recreation poking fun at the bureaucracy that surrounds us. But Brickleberry -- stuffed with exaggerated stereotypes (a horny lesbian, a lazy African-American, and a sexed-up blonde, among others) who offend without any greater purpose -- is just sad. Edgy comedy that's smart can be justified, but this... there's just nothing here of value for families.Related articles from Common Sense Media  10 Best TV Role Models 10 Worst TV Role Models of 2012 Q&A: Which celebrities are good role models for girls?About Common Sense Media Common Sense Media is dedicated to improving the lives of kids and families by providing the trustworthy information, education, and independent voice they need to thrive in a world of media and technology.

He has not taken responsibility for the fabric or the way they are made, but rather decided to say that, ""Frankly, some women's bodies just actually don't work [for the yoga pants]."" He also said, ""It's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, and how much they use it.""Now, these are yoga pants. Yoga pants are supposed to be the most comfortable and durable pants out there. So I told my wife about this story and told her I was going to try on a pair of Lululemon yoga pants to put it to the test. My wife looked at me and kind of smiled. She told me I would not fit into a pair of Lululemon yoga pants.I told her that was crazy! I wear men's medium shirts and pants. I lost over 200 pounds. Heck, I ran 10 miles today. I could fit into a pair of those pants no problem.So I looked at the largest size, which was a 12. I was thinking I would be more like an eight or a 10. I mean, Jessica Simpson was a size eight and people called her plus-size. Plus-size models are usually between eight and 18 for women. So I went to Target to try on a pair of size eight yoga pants. I held it up to me and did not even try. Then I went to try on the size 12. It would not even go up my whole leg.Not that I would ever wear women's yoga pants, but I was bummed. How is it that I wear size medium men's everything and I cannot even fit into a pair of yoga pants? Then I started to wonder what size I actually am in women's clothes.I now knew I was a ""plus-size"" woman. So I needed to go to a ""plus-size"" store. I went to a store called The Avenue Plus. I walked in, and they were not busy. I am glad they were not busy. I went right up to an associate and asked her a simple question:""What size do you think I am?""I did not have a chance to tell her I was a writer or I was trying to write about the Lululemon yoga pants. She quickly said:""Size 20.""TWENTY! I got mad and told her she was crazy. There is no way in the world that I was a size 20! I wore all medium clothes. I ran 10 miles and I lost over 200 pounds.She told me I had large hips and big legs. She said that with my shoulders there was no way I could fit into anything but a size 20. She held up a few dresses to me to prove that she was right.She was right.I thanked her and walked out. While I was in the car I thought about how unfair women's sizes are to men's sizes. I do not wear anything that is considered a large. No one makes comments about my size anymore. I have not ripped or gone through a pair of pants in years.Yet if I was a woman I would have to shop at ""plus-size"" stores. I would be too large to be a true ""plus-size"" model. I would be looked upon as the problem for obesity instead of the solution that some see me as.And that bothered me.There is a double standard for men and women. Chip Wilson is way wrong about his pants. They are made wrong; it has nothing to do with the thighs or the hips.Take it from me. I am a plus-size woman who has never ripped a pair of pants.This post originally appeared on The Anti-Jared.___________________ Also on The Huffington Post:"

Waking up late, snuggling for a while in bed, we enjoyed a slow and relaxing morning. When we decided to head out of the house, I started to rush him to put on his shoes. He gave me an exasperated look and said, ""Do we really have to rush with the shoes today? I like to take my time; the shoes go on better that way."" Exhale... ""Of course we don't have to rush today. Let's be slow."" Even as the words escaped my lips, I knew I didn't REALLY mean it. I don't know how to go slow, and so, as he struggled with the laces, I struggled to not jump in and just-get-them-tied-already!Shoes finally on, many changes of jacket-no, sweater-no, shirt-no, jacket- no, yellow fleece later, we were sorted. And so we set off for our adventure. At first, I walked at my normal (rushed) pace, until Edem protested with foot stomps and yellow fleeced arms crossed over his chest: ""I. Won't. Rush. Today!"" Clearly, I needed to adjust.Moving in our adjusted, and at first uncomfortable for me pace, slowly, we explored our new neighborhood, walking down streets we have never before visited, admiring Halloween decorations and fall foliage displays. Edem took notice of the beautiful door on one house, and I commented on the amazing porch on another. Hand in hand, we skipped, and sometimes hopped, our way around our new community. Without a clear destination in mind, we relished our roles as foreigners in a new land. ""Next year,"" I said, ""this will all be so familiar, we won't appreciate it anymore."" ""Don't be ridiculous!"" Edem exclaimed, the new word tumbling clumsily out of his mouth. ""THIS,"" his arms opened wide as he spun in his blue rain boots, ""will alllllwaaaayyyyssss be AWESOME!"" And so we slowly skipped on, looking for more awesomeness that will always be there to be appreciated. Edem became my photo director.""Picture this!"" he would exclaim, directing the lens of my camera to a new thing worthy of being captured. An orange flower, a rose, a purple weed, spiderwebs strewn from a gate. The ancient car whose top was peeling off, and the red bicycle leaning against a gate.We stopped into a precious café, where Edem promptly ordered two star cookies. ""To go,"" I replied. ""Here,"" Edem countered. And so we sat. While he licked the red and blue sugar grains off each cookie, I took in the fine details of this exquisite little dining spot, read through the menu twice and snapped a few pictures as the chef turned the dining room into his cooking spot. Cookies savored and finally gone, I stood to leave. ""Not YET! I need a pen."" ""A pen?"" A PEN? What now, I thought. ""I need a PEN! We cannot leave until I do this."" Sigh. Groan. A Pen. ""But we are missing the sun! We need to get to the park!""""Mom, I need a pen."" Digging around in my deep bag, I found a purple pen. I wasn't permitted to look as he wrote, taking careful time with each letter, sounding a few sounds out as he wrote new words. What seemed like ages later, Edem was finished. ""There you go, Mom! Something special for our slow adventure day! A love note for you!"" My heart swelled and simultaneously shattered. My son, the one whom I am always ushering from place to place, is not one to be rushed. When allowed to move through this world in his pace, given time to think and explore, he flourishes, and teaches me to see the beauty that surrounds us. Slowly, we meandered to the park. Sometimes skipping, sometimes hopping; sometimes taking a new road that we knew wasn't the most direct path. ""This is nice, Mom. I'm proud of you; you are learning to enjoy our adventure.""Yet again, I have learned a lesson from my son. My teacher. My slow and deliberate enjoyer of life."

I thought I had really ""seen it all,"" so to speak. For the past five years, I have had the privilege of being a vagipreneur, a person in the business of female sexual health. I have spoken about female body parts, sexuality, satisfaction, intimate topics everywhere -- on TV, on the news, in print, online, at conferences, at universities, dinner parties -- you name it. And I thought I could handle it.Of course, I have often expressed my dismay at the double standards that govern the communication and discussion around male and female sexuality. For instance, no one yet has sufficiently answered why four-hour erections are appropriate fare on TV ads during any time of the day, while bathtub-free ads talking about female sexual satisfaction are considered taboo. And I have ranted about the over-sexualized depictions of women (and girls) in movies and ads for everything from sneakers to drain cleaners. I have struggled to understand why Warner Brothers' TMZ told me that a professional discussion about female satisfaction was inappropriate during the early evening time slot, but stories about humans having sex with animals and a special ""TMZ Apocalypse Sex Party"" were fine. But the other day in my inbox, I had an e-mail with the title, ""Life is Short -- Have an Affair."" And I have to admit, it threw me for a loop. The content of the e-mail was even more disturbing. It read: The number one rule if you are considering having an affair is never to do so with a single woman. Instead, date a married woman who has just as much reason to keep your affair a secret as you do. At Ashley Madison you will literally meet MILLIONS of married women who are stuck in sexless marriages and are searching for someone to have a discreet affair with.Listen, I am not in charge of anybody else's marriage. The only marriage I need to concentrate on is my own -- 23 years and counting. I know couples make all kinds of choices and compromises to make their marriages and relationships work. But really... having an affair with another married person? Is that the best option available to unhappy couples? And let's say I even believed that cheating spouses are taking precautions to avoid sexually-transmitted diseases (even though the data say otherwise). The website goes even further: Ashley Madison is the most successful website for finding an affair and cheating partners. Have an affair today on Ashley Madison. Thousands of cheating wives and cheating husbands signup everyday looking for an affair.I don't know what the 22,150,000 members of Ashley Madison referred to on the site are thinking. Let's say they don't ever get caught and nobody gets a disease. What message are they sending to their children, nieces, nephews, whomever. One thing I know for sure, I will be able to tell my children with a straight face that marriage requires commitment, acceptance, an ability to forgive, common interests -- a sense of humor does not hurt either. It is sometimes spectacular, sometimes hard, sometimes confusing, sometimes a whole lot of things. At no point, however, will I mention Ashley Madison was a key tool for our successful marriage. But really, how can 22,150,000 all be wrong? Maybe I am the one who doesn't get it. Maybe this is the new world of relationships, marriage, connections and I am just out of touch. Well if this is the new normal, I think I will stay in Kansas with Toto, my husband and children."

A new study from the Justice Policy Center's Urban Institute found that 17 percent of youths had been cyberbullied in the past year. Taking lawmakers, schools and parents to task for this rampant problem, HuffPost blogger Steve Siebold writes: ""They need to stop denying the problem and closing their doors, and start acting like leaders. Parents need to be more involved with their children, and stop bullying in its tracks. If not, parents need to be held accountable, too.""Some legal minds also want to punish parents whose children become involved in cyberbullying. Last month, Florida-based legal advocacy group Justice Outreach proposed a bill called ""Bullying, Cyberbully, and Harassment -- Parental Responsibility,"" which would legally define both bullying and cyberbullying and would hold parents of bullies and bullying victims accountable if they fail to supervise their children.While the legal culpability in bullying cases is still up for debate, there are many resources to help parents recognize warning signs that their child might be engaging in bullying behavior. Stopbullying.gov notes that children may be bullying others if they ""are increasingly aggressive,"" ""blame others for their problems"" and ""are competitive and worry about their reputation or popularity."" So what's a concerned parent to do? The National Crime Prevention Council outlines a whole range of steps for parents who think their children might be bullying. The council cautions against treating the behavior like a passing phase and recommends contacting teachers or school counselors."
8,FOOD & DRINK,Is It Ever OK to Call Yourself a Mixologist?,"Tom Macy, Contributor

Long treated as dead spaces that hotel guests raced through on the way to the elevator, lobbies are being transformed into places to work, surf the Web or meet friends for a drink. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da53b2000004e00fe0b4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before I begin let me just say now: To those bartenders who think calling yourself a mixologist is an excuse for serving drinks with a frown at a snail's pace, you are morons and are giving the rest of us a bad name. This article isn't even acknowledging your kind.Now that that's out of the way, we can proceed.When spoken out loud, I've noticed the word ""Mixologist"" always seems to be accompanied by air quotations -- as if the person they're talking to will mistakenly assume they're using it earnestly. Along with Miley Cyrus and Toddlers and Tiaras, society has agreed to give this smug invention of hipster culture the collective eye roll. Despite the fact that the word mixologist was coined in the 1850's, back when being a Barman was a highly regarded profession sometimes requiring years of apprenticeship.Admittedly it's a difficult word, suggesting that the craft of mixing cocktails; a purely (and delightfully) frivolous skill, should stand alongside other ""ologist"" suffixed occupations -- paleontologist, neurologist, mixologist. So perhaps it is deserving of all the ridicule. E.g. the episode of Girls where Lena Dunham and Mike Birbiglia mocked us for wearing ""tiny vests."" (Guilty as charged, though it's just a regular sized vest.)A lot of people address this as a questions of labels. Indeed, the mixologist vs bartender piece has been tackled by the Internet ad nauseum. You're just a Google search away from countless articles featuring that very title. But the articles never feature much of a debate, just a list of quotes from various cocktail professionals (myself among them) who, when posed the question of which they prefer, universally dismiss mixologist as pretentious and assure that we are just ""regular old bartenders."" Which is true. By definition a bartender is someone who makes and serves drinks, and a mixologist is someone who creates them. So in most cases if you're a mixologist, you're also a bartender.But that answer skirts over the heart of the issue, which isn't one of definitions. If your work involves creating cocktails but not making them, by definition, you're a mixologist. It would be incorrect to refer to yourself as a bartender. So what then?I was faced with this conundrum recently when I started to branch out from behind the bar and do things like consulting on cocktail menus, writing articles (such as the one you're reading now), and cocktail videos (forgive the shameless plug). When I looked into getting business cards I was suddenly faced with the question of how to state my title. I was stumped. Anything but ""mixologist,"" I thought. Cocktail expert? No way, that's worse. Cocktail consultant? Too narrow. Then I wondered whether it was ever ok to call yourself a mixologist. Even when it's true. As I thought about it, I started to get jealous of other fellow members of the food and beverage industry. Like chefs, after they've stepped out from behind the line, written a few cookbooks, gotten a reality show and designed their own line of cook wear, they're still chefs. Not to mention that the term Celebrity Chef is somehow perfectly acceptable as well. Or certified wine professionals, who undergo exhaustive testing to earn esteemed titles like Master Sommelier and Master of Wine (less than 300 in the world) and wear them with pride and honor. Then I thought how ridiculous it is that I'm ashamed of my job title and how nice it would be if I could just call myself a mixologist -- unofficial as it may be but still the official word in the English language for my profession -- without feeling embarrassed or judged.One perk would be I wouldn't have to play a bizarre game of real life Taboo every time my job comes up in conversation. It's impossible to tell someone flat out: ""I'm a mixologist"" without sounding pretentious as all hell. Go ahead, try saying it out loud. So I have to explain what I do without using the word mixologist, until they eventually understand and say, ""Oh, you're a mixologist.""I think the main issue lies in the perception that we chose this word and that we choose whether or not to use it. Intentionally or not, we are judged by that decision, which is on some level is understandable -- anyone can say they are a mixologist. There's no certification or degree program like there is in wine (yet, just wait 10 years). So if anyone can use it, it's effectively meaningless as a definition, leaving just our efforts as the sole means of expressing what it is we do. So I will continue to tread lightly until a less offensive word emerges or mixologist gains universal acceptance, which is fine by me. I'm happy to let my work speak for itself. Honestly, I just want to know what to put on my business cards."
