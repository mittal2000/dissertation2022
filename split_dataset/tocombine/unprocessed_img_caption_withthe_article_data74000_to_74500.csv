John Boehner (R-Ohio), literally planting yard signs for an up-and-coming Republican 25 years ago.Back then, Ryan was exactly the sort of young believer who many envisioned could become the leader he grew to be, winning a congressional seat from Wisconsin and achieving the top Republican spot on the House Budget Committee, where he crafted such brutally draconian spending plans that Democrats made the ""Ryan Budget"" an epithet in almost every campaign ad.One spot showed Ryan shoving a grandma off a cliff.But those years also made Ryan a hero to the right, the rare policy wonk who was willing to challenge GOP complacency on the budget, and even take credit for Social Security and Medicare reform ideas that Democrats felt sure would doom him.But they didn't. Republicans won in 2010 and Ryan became an icon.One veteran Republican, willing to speak candidly about the new House speaker in exchange for anonymity, admitted that he and other established politicians wouldn't go near the early Ryan budget, but now wish they had. Ryan's fiscal blueprint is ""the holy grail,"" the congressman said.That probably explains why the earnest 45-year-old from Janesville, Wisconsin, won over conservative members of the House Republican conference for the speaker job after they rebelled at California's Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the current majority leader.What it doesn't explain is why Republicans and Democrats see in Ryan someone who actually has a chance, slim as it may be, to repair the divides in Congress.Most politicians talk up the virtues and struggles of the middle class. One thing that's a little different about Ryan is his penchant for talking about poverty, a habit he inherited from Jack Kemp, a former congressman from upstate New York and housing secretary under President George H.W. Bush, whom Ryan has called a mentor. That's why, after Ryan's failed vice presidential bid in 2012 -- a campaign that sank in part because of class issues and Mitt Romney's infamous disparagement of the poor -- Ryan's path to the gavel went through a soup line. During the campaign, the Ryan family ostentatiously donned gleaming aprons and washed dishes during a short photo-op at an Ohio soup kitchen, a stunt that seemed to backfire when the charity operator said some of the pots and pans weren't even dirty. The next year, Ryan embarked on what many called a ""poverty tour,"" spending at least a dozen weekends immersing himself in the dirty sink of bad neighborhoods, observing as religious nonprofits in various cities hand-washed the souls of poor people who wanted to better themselves. Bob Woodson, director of a Washington-based nonprofit that advises other charities across the country on how to help the poor, served as Ryan's guide during his yearlong quest for ways to alleviate poverty without throwing more money at it. ""After Paul Ryan lost the presidential race, he went on this journey to deepen his understanding about poverty-fighting,"" Woodson told HuffPost this week. ""And he asked me to take him on these journeys without any press.""Ryan and Woodson favor an approach to poverty that is oddly resonant with late 19th century panics over roving tramps and indiscriminate soup. The underlying concern is that too much assistance impoverishes the soul. Still, Ryan's effort to become a poverty expert led him to some common ground with President Barack Obama. Early in 2014, the president unveiled his ""My Brother's Keeper"" initiative to help young African-American men. The president lamented the ""bad choices"" he had made as a youngster, linking them to the problems confronting African-American youths today. Ryan sent the president a letter offering to help. Obama called Ryan to thank him personally. (Ryan's office and the White House declined to share details about the correspondence.)Ryan remains focused on economic strategies that Democrats say aid the rich. His Ways and Means Committee has passed numerous tax-cut bills that would add hundreds of billions to the deficit.But he also seems to have acquired enough perspective on how the other half lives to at least include them in his vision.Indeed, Ryan's speech to Congress on Thursday had several clear warnings to the tea party that he would not just heed their dictates and the ever-more insistent demands that ricochet through the conservative echo chamber.""We are the body closest to the people,"" Ryan said. He added: ""We don’t echo the people. We represent the people.""""They look at Washington, and all they see is chaos,"" he said, although he explicitly avoided blaming the GOP base that many more moderate Republicans fault. ""Only a fully functioning House can truly represent the people.""Democrats have responded positively, and so far are taking Ryan at his word.Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is expected to take over as the top Democrat in the Senate in 2017, praised Ryan for being “straightforward,” “honorable” and “willing to compromise.” “I think that’s the really positive things about him -- who he is as a person,” Schumer said. “When I look at his budget, I say ‘yikes’ -- you know privatizing Medicare, Social Security, decimating the whole federal government. That’s sort of almost apart from the Paul Ryan you know and you talk to.”Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said it wasn't his intention to ""embarrass"" Ryan with Republicans, clarifying comments he made earlier in the week about how great it is to work with Ryan.""The fact is, you know, people around here ... you can become sometimes kind of calloused about things around here,"" Reid said. ""I don't know of anyone else who could have been elected speaker than him. Now I don't know what the future holds. I think he's in for a rocky road but at least as a result of his stepping forward and agreeing to take this job he didn't want, we were able to get this budget thing done.""It’s that collaborative nature, and unique background, that has a majority of House Republicans eager for the change in leadership.“He’s not the normal political position type -- he’s a thought leader, and an institutionalist,” the veteran GOP member said. “First of all, Paul will be more visionary.”Boehner, the member said, was “instinctively leery” of broad goals, instead focusing on practical legislation he knew he could shepherd across the finish line.“Ryan’s style is very opposite -- it’s exactly to do that, here’s the big vision, here’s where we want to go,” the congressman said. Ryan also signals a generational change that will help Republicans dramatically.Ryan takes over as speaker in a strong position, in part due to the national profile he has cultivated since 2012. But that strength also is due to Boehner’s final two-year budget deal with the White House that lifts the debt ceiling until March 2017 -- leaving little leverage for the conservative wing to use against him. “I don’t think there’s another time in American history that I can think of when somebody becomes speaker that millions of people, literally, already have voted for and is known in a way most legislative people are never known. It’s one of the reasons why he’s able to at least initially deal with the Freedom Caucus,” said the GOP congressman, referring to the conservative faction within House Republican ranks. Ryan convinced much of the House Freedom Caucus to rally behind him by pushing a to-do list for his first few months in office that included shaking up the process the House has fallen into in recent years. Ryan told the hard-line caucus that he would make changes to the House Steering Committee, which assigns House committee membership, by Thanksgiving. He also has promoted broader House process changes, and has expressed willingness to return to regular order, with legislation originating in the committees that have jurisdiction, and then onto the floor. In a private meeting with House Republicans this week, Ryan alluded to conservative members' sudden and sporadic plots against Boehner, telling the Republican conference, “‘Look, I’m prepared to take arrows to my chest, but not in my back.'""He’s ""the right guy to check some of this Freedom Caucus tactical idiocy,” the member added. While the mood on Capitol Hill for Ryan’s swearing in appeared jovial and harmonious, with a number of Freedom Caucus members joining to give him a strong majority vote, those same conservatives will keep a watchful eye on their new leader.“Whatever the next big issue is, I think it’s very important for Paul, that he show some marginal improvement.” said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), a member of the Freedom Caucus. “That whatever comes next, we can look at it as a conference and say this is better than it would have been had Boehner still been here.”Despite remaining “cautiously optimistic” about Ryan’s ascension, Mulvaney said conservatives are expecting to see “a dramatic change” in the way House Republicans operate. “We learned that Paul was much more empathetic to our frustrations with the way this place works than we ever realized he would be, and that was very encouraging to us,” Mulvaney said. “He learned, I think, that our frustrations were justified. It wasn’t division for the sake of division -- it was a logical response to mistreatment by the prior leadership.”Slightly discouraged by the budget deal Boehner wrapped up on his way out, Mulvaney wondered what conservatives could use as a litmus tests for Ryan. He had at least one in mind. When the House works on a larger bill to fund the nation’s highways, roads and bridges over the next month, Mulvaney said his caucus will be looking to see if the process is better, if the House gets involved early, and if Ryan allows the Senate to dictate what the House does. Ryan will have to pass a long-term extension of the Highway Trust Fund by Nov. 20, and push through an omnibus spending bill in December. And if the House Freedom Caucus isn’t testing him enough, outside tea party groups like FreedomWorks will. “Paul Ryan’s record has blemishes, the most recent of which was his vote in favor of the Obama-Boehner budget,” said FreedomWorks CEO Adam Brandon. “But the race for speaker wasn’t about personalities; it was about process. Ryan knows what he needs to do gain the trust of House conservatives to avoid Boehner’s fate.”Conservative Heritage Action, too, ripped into the budget deal that Ryan supported this week, and challenged the new speaker to embrace a “bold conservative policy agenda.”At the end of the day, Ryan will be expected to heal the turmoil among House Republicans, and enter into a leadership that includes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) -- with whom he has worked very little.Also on HuffPost:"

2,POLITICS,Racism Is Rampant In Jury Selection. The Supreme Court Can't Fix It.,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-death-penalty-racism_us_563603d9e4b063179912af3a,"The Constitution prohibits excluding jurors on the basis of race, but there isn't much the justices can do to remedy that.",2015-11-01,"Eddie Hood was a potential juror in the murder trial of Timothy T. Foster, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of an elderly white woman in 1987.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Timothy Foster has spent almost 30 years on Georgia's death row. On Monday, his lawyer will appear before the Supreme Court to fight for his life.That's because Foster v. Chatman, a high-profile case about racism in jury selection, is really not a case about racism in jury selection. It's a case about racism in the application of the death penalty.Consider what Stephen Lanier, the prosecutor who tried Foster in 1987, told the all-white jury who heard the case. During the penalty phase of the trial, he said a death sentence was appropriate for Foster to send a message ""to other people out there in the projects."" Foster lived in government housing, and about 90 percent of his neighbors were black.Or ponder a psychiatrist's testimony on Foster's behalf, who found he ""was in the borderline range for intellectual disability"" -- with an IQ range between 58 and 80 his entire life. The jury rejected it and voted for death anyway.Or the very length of time Foster has spent on death row, or the reality he is only one of the 56 percent of those awaiting execution who are people of color, according to a recent NAACP Legal Defense Fund report.There's a lot of things inherently suspect with the Foster case -- and the capital system in general -- and yet the Supreme Court on Monday will only be confronting the very limited issue of whether prosecutors improperly excluded on the basis of race all blacks who were perfectly capable of sitting in Foster's trial. This is a real problem that's still very much alive today.Foster v. Chatman has been styled that way because that's how advocates chip away at the death penalty these days -- by showing how it's unconstitutionally stacked against some defendants and not others.So far, the justices have heard or will hear a number of cases that attack the procedures states use in doling out death sentences, but none challenging the capital system itself. That case hasn't yet arrived, even though there's an open invitation to bring one to the table.The Foster case presumably drew the court's attention because blatant examples of racial discrimination -- especially if a person's life is on the line -- tend to draw more scrutiny than subtler forms of bias in the administration of justice. This one is the blatant kind. In 2006, Foster's lawyers got lucky when -- through an open-records request -- they got hold of the notes prosecutors made during jury selection in the case. To their surprise, they discovered that all the names of the potential jurors who were black were highlighted and marked with the letter B.At the top of each juror list, a key indicated that green highlight meant the potential juror was black. Separate juror questionnaires had the word ""black"" circled. No black jurors sat in Foster's trial.His lawyer before the Supreme Court, Stephen Bright, said in a brief filed with the court that this ""evidence clearly establishes purposeful discrimination by the prosecution"" -- particularly troubling if indeed the goal was to get the all-white jury to issue a death sentence and thus teach people ""in the projects"" a lesson.If the justices side with Foster and rule that his trial violated the Constitution's promise of equal protection, then he'll likely get a new one and potentially skirt death that way. But can the Supreme Court do more and fix the law in order to keep this from happening ever again? In court papers filed ahead of Monday's hearing, a group of former prosecutors urged the court to rule for Foster because ""race discrimination persists in jury selection,"" and insisted that the court's prior ruling in Batson v. Kentucky remains ""an important safeguard against"" abuses in the jury system.That case, decided one year before Foster was convicted, established that the Constitution prohibits lawyers from using so-called ""peremptory strikes"" to shut out potential jurors on account of their race -- the rationale being that no citizen can be denied an opportunity to serve on a jury.The thing with peremptory strikes is that lawyers can use them to challenge potential jurors for almost any conceivable reason -- except a discriminatory reason, like race or gender. Since every lawyer wants to win a case, the only thing they have to do if the other side accuses them of discriminating against a juror is provide a ""race-neutral"" justification. And coming up with those justifications, it turns out, isn't really hard. Over the years, both prosecutors and defense lawyers have gotten really good at excluding jurors by coming up with non-racial reasons on the fly: That juror looked funny. That lady in the back didn't seem really invested in the case. The gentleman with the glasses is too old.In the Foster case, the prosecutor offered a litany of reasons to explain away his singling out of black members of the jury pool: The person's age. Their occupation. Church affiliation. Someone's appearance as ""hostile."" Whether they agreed with the death penalty. All of those, if believed by a judge, are perfectly permissible -- even if in the prosecutor's heart of hearts they're no more than bullshit.But the other side is also prone to bullshit. Just like prosecutors have an interest in securing convictions by drawing a jury panel that's sympathetic to their case, defense lawyers too want jurors who will view their client favorably. And they may very well seek to exclude a white woman for the sheer reason that she's white, or fight to keep a black person on the panel because the accused is also black. Isn't that unconstitutional, too?Though it's possible the Supreme Court will grasp the egregiousness of the Foster case and rule in his favor, it is far from clear if the justices will use his circumstances to fashion a practicable rule that would soften the edges of the problem nationwide.Much like the death penalty, the use of race in jury selection seems like something the court can only chip away at -- not fully eradicate."
3,THE WORLDPOST,Turkey To Return To Single-Party Rule After Sweeping Election Victory,"Ercan Gurses and Orhan Coskun, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turkey-to-return-to-single-party-rule-after-sweeping-election-victory_us_5636590fe4b0c66bae5cc17c,"""This is a success exceeding our expectations,"" a party official said, acknowledging the scale of the victory was a surprise.",2015-11-01,"Turkey returned the AKP to majority government on Sunday, in a big boost to President Erdogan.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Turkey looked set to return to single-party rule after the Islamist-rooted AK Party swept to victory in a general election on Sunday, a major boost for embattled President Tayyip Erdogan but an outcome likely to sharpen deep social divisions.Prime Minister and AKP leader Ahmet Davutoglu tweeted simply: ""Elhamdulillah"" (Thanks be to god)Security forces fired tear gas at stone-throwing protesters in the mainly Kurdish southeastern city of Diyarbakir as results filtered in, with support for the pro-Kurdish opposition falling perilously near the 10 percent threshold to enter parliament.In June, the AKP lost the overall majority it had enjoyed since 2002. Erdogan had presented Sunday's polls as a chance to restore stability at a time of tension over Kurdish insurrection and after two bombings, attributed to Islamic State, while critics fear a drift to authoritarianism under the president.With 95 percent of votes counted, the AKP was on 49.5 percent, according to state-run broadcaster TRT, higher than many party officials had expected. The main opposition CHP was at 25.2 percent and a senior official said any hopes of a coalition now looked all but impossible.Senior AKP officials told Reuters they expected to be able to form a single-party government again, with one of them forecasting a final share of around 45-46 percent of the vote.""This is a success exceeding our expectations,"" one of the officials said, acknowledging the scale of the victory was a surprise.Since June's poll, a ceasefire with Kurdish militants has collapsed, the war in neighboring Syria has worsened and Turkey - a NATO member state - has been buffeted by two Islamic State-linked suicide bomb attacks that killed more than 130 people.Investors and Western allies hoped the vote would help restore stability and confidence in an $800 billion economy, allowing Ankara to play a more effective role in stemming a flood of refugees from neighboring wars via Turkey into Europe and helping in the battle against Islamic State militants.But in strengthening Erdogan, whose crackdowns on media freedoms and tightening grip on the judiciary have alarmed European leaders, the outcome is likely to mean relations with the West will remain strained.Erdogan and the AKP have been a fierce critics, for example, of U.S. support for Kurdish militia fighters battling Islamic State (IS) in neighboring Syria.""This (result) makes more difficult a strategy of using the Kurds against IS because AKP appeals to anti-Kurd sentiments,"" said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and sometime policy advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama.TRT's partial results said the nationalist MHP opposition stood at 12 percent.The HDP, which scaled back its election campaign after its supporters were targeted in the Ankara suicide bomb attack that killed more than 100 people on Oct. 10, was on 10.3 percent.""SIMPLY A DISASTER""This time, there were few of the flags, posters and campaign buses that thronged the streets in the build-up to June's vote.""It is obvious in today's election how beneficial stability is for our nation and today our citizens will make their choice based on this,"" Erdogan told reporters after voting in his home district of Camlica on the Asian side of Istanbul.The election was prompted by the AKP's inability to find a junior coalition partner after the June outcome. Erdogan's critics said it represented a gamble by the combative leader to win back enough support so the party can eventually change the constitution and give him greater presidential powers.It is a gamble that appears to have paid off.""Turkey lost considerable ground in economy, politics and terror during this period, and gains were lost. Voters appeared to want to bring back stability once again,"" a third AKP official said.Some Western allies, foreign investors and Turks had seen an AKP coalition with the CHP as the best hope of easing sharp divisions in the EU-candidate nation, hoping it might keep Erdogan's authoritarian instincts in check.A senior official from the CHP, which had been preparing itself for potential coalition talks, said the result was ""simply a disaster"".POLARIZATIONThe results could aggravate deep splits in Turkey - between pious conservatives who champion Erdogan as a hero of the working class, and Western-facing secularists suspicious of his authoritarianism and Islamist ideals.Voters were sharply divided in their views on a return to single-party rule or the prospect of a coalition.""The little welfare, better living conditions, bigger house and fancier appliances we have, we all owe it to AK Party and Erdogan,"" said Nurcan Gunduz, 24, at the airport in Ankara.""Look at the state of the country after the June 7 election results and we didn't even have a coalition government. I can't imagine how worse it would be if we did have it.""But Yasar, a 62-year-old retired laborer now working as a shoeshine man outside a mosque in the conservative Istanbul district of Uskudar, said he switched his vote to the main opposition CHP in hopes of a coalition.""I've given up on the AKP.

Erdogan had presented Sunday's polls as a chance to restore stability at a time of tension over Kurdish insurrection and after two bombings, attributed to Islamic State, while critics fear a drift to authoritarianism under the president.With 95 percent of votes counted, the AKP was on 49.5 percent, according to state-run broadcaster TRT, higher than many party officials had expected. The main opposition CHP was at 25.2 percent and a senior official said any hopes of a coalition now looked all but impossible.Senior AKP officials told Reuters they expected to be able to form a single-party government again, with one of them forecasting a final share of around 45-46 percent of the vote.""This is a success exceeding our expectations,"" one of the officials said, acknowledging the scale of the victory was a surprise.Since June's poll, a ceasefire with Kurdish militants has collapsed, the war in neighboring Syria has worsened and Turkey - a NATO member state - has been buffeted by two Islamic State-linked suicide bomb attacks that killed more than 130 people.Investors and Western allies hoped the vote would help restore stability and confidence in an $800 billion economy, allowing Ankara to play a more effective role in stemming a flood of refugees from neighboring wars via Turkey into Europe and helping in the battle against Islamic State militants.But in strengthening Erdogan, whose crackdowns on media freedoms and tightening grip on the judiciary have alarmed European leaders, the outcome is likely to mean relations with the West will remain strained.Erdogan and the AKP have been a fierce critics, for example, of U.S. support for Kurdish militia fighters battling Islamic State (IS) in neighboring Syria.""This (result) makes more difficult a strategy of using the Kurds against IS because AKP appeals to anti-Kurd sentiments,"" said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and sometime policy advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama.TRT's partial results said the nationalist MHP opposition stood at 12 percent.The HDP, which scaled back its election campaign after its supporters were targeted in the Ankara suicide bomb attack that killed more than 100 people on Oct. 10, was on 10.3 percent.""SIMPLY A DISASTER""This time, there were few of the flags, posters and campaign buses that thronged the streets in the build-up to June's vote.""It is obvious in today's election how beneficial stability is for our nation and today our citizens will make their choice based on this,"" Erdogan told reporters after voting in his home district of Camlica on the Asian side of Istanbul.The election was prompted by the AKP's inability to find a junior coalition partner after the June outcome. Erdogan's critics said it represented a gamble by the combative leader to win back enough support so the party can eventually change the constitution and give him greater presidential powers.It is a gamble that appears to have paid off.""Turkey lost considerable ground in economy, politics and terror during this period, and gains were lost. Voters appeared to want to bring back stability once again,"" a third AKP official said.Some Western allies, foreign investors and Turks had seen an AKP coalition with the CHP as the best hope of easing sharp divisions in the EU-candidate nation, hoping it might keep Erdogan's authoritarian instincts in check.A senior official from the CHP, which had been preparing itself for potential coalition talks, said the result was ""simply a disaster"".POLARIZATIONThe results could aggravate deep splits in Turkey - between pious conservatives who champion Erdogan as a hero of the working class, and Western-facing secularists suspicious of his authoritarianism and Islamist ideals.Voters were sharply divided in their views on a return to single-party rule or the prospect of a coalition.""The little welfare, better living conditions, bigger house and fancier appliances we have, we all owe it to AK Party and Erdogan,"" said Nurcan Gunduz, 24, at the airport in Ankara.""Look at the state of the country after the June 7 election results and we didn't even have a coalition government. I can't imagine how worse it would be if we did have it.""But Yasar, a 62-year-old retired laborer now working as a shoeshine man outside a mosque in the conservative Istanbul district of Uskudar, said he switched his vote to the main opposition CHP in hopes of a coalition.""I've given up on the AKP.

The vote was Turkey's second of 2015, after a previous election in June unexpectedly booted the AKP from its long-held parliamentary majority.In the months that followed June's result, the country entered a period of political tension and violence. The government launched an air strike campaign against Kurdish PKK militants after years of cease-fire, and a suspected Islamic State bombing killed 97 people in the worst terror attack in Turkey's history.The vote on Sunday took place amid tight security and was largely peaceful, save for protests in the southern Kurdish area of Diyarbakir, where dozens of demonstrators angry at the result clashed with police. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his AK Party have been longtime antagonists to pro-Kurdish groups.The Islamist AKP's return to dominance is a boon to Erdogan, who was sidelined after the June vote and called the snap elections after his party failed to form a coalition government. Opponents of Erdogan have criticized his increasingly authoritarian tendencies and media crackdowns, with journalists telling Reuters before the election that they feared what a boost to Erdogan's power could mean for media freedom. The WorldPost presents a selection of photos from across Turkey on the day of the election, showing both the celebrations and tribulations caused by the vote.Also on HuffPost:"

Now, Clinton said in his speech, it's up to the Israeli people to secure that peace.“Rabin’s legacy in one way is clear and untouchable,” Clinton said, The Times of Israel reported. “He risked his life to create and defend Israel. He spent his life serving Israel to advance your values and your interests. And he gave his life so that you could live in peace.”“What does it all amount to? Now that is up to you,"" Clinton said, later adding: ""All of you now must decide when you leave here tonight ... how to finish the last chapter of his story.”Rabin, Clinton said, did not want to see Israel ""come to a democratic crossroads where it has to decide whether it is a Jewish state or a democratic state.”In a prerecorded video aired at the rally, President Barack Obama made similar calls for peace.""Peace is necessary because it is the only way to ensure true lasting security for Israelis and Palestinians,"" Obama said.

9,RELIGION,All Souls' Day 2015: Dates And Origins Of The Day To Pray For The Dead,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/all-souls-day-2015-dates-facts-and-traditions_us_56340865e4b0c66bae5ca0b5,This Catholic holy day remembers those who have passed.,2015-11-01,"Jan 1 - Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God (Catholic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c216ae1d00002f00143e4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Once the Halloween candy has been counted and the costumes stored away, many religious people around the world enter into a time of remembrance for the dead. In the Christian calendar, this tradition is upheld on All Souls’ Day, which falls yearly on Nov. 2. It follows All Saints’ Day, which is observed on Nov. 1. While All Saints' Day is a day that Catholics remember those who have already entered heaven, All Souls' Day is a day to pray for all loved ones who have died. In particular, Catholics remember the souls of those who are caught in purgatory, undergoing a process of purification before entering heaven.The Catholic Church teaches that ""all who die in God’s grace, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven.""The purification that happens in purgatory is entirely different from the punishment that takes place in hell. According to the church's catechism -- a document containing essential church teachings -- purgatory is like a ""cleansing"" or ""purifying"" fire for people who are already assured of God's grace. Catholics believe that souls in purgatory can be helped along the path towards heaven by the prayers of those who are still living. All Souls' Day is not a holy day of obligation, so Catholics aren't expected to attend church. However, if it falls on a Sunday, Catholics mark the day by attending a special Mass. Catholics also visit the graves of their loved ones, where they light candles, leave flowers and sprinkle holy water.One of the most famous prayers for those in purgatory is the prayer of St. Gertrude the Great, a 13th century German Benedictine nun. According to tradition, God revealed to the nun that the following prayer would release 1,000 souls from purgatory every time it is said:Eternal Father, I offer Thee the Most Precious Blood of Thy Divine Son, Jesus, in union with the Masses said throughout the world today, for all the Holy Souls in Purgatory, for sinners everywhere, for sinners in the universal church, those in my own home and within my family. Amen.Although All Souls' Day is primarily a Catholic holy day, it is also observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican church and a few other Protestant denominations. In Latin American countries and communities, All Souls' Day celebrations are often tied to Día de Muertos (also Día de los Muertos), or ""the Day of the Dead,"" which falls on Nov. 1 and 2. Celebrations are elaborate and joyful, with observers participating in costume parades and visits to cemeteries. Some families create altars inside their homes to remember their departed relatives. All Souls' falls during a time of year when many religions are thinking about death. It is a period when ancient agricultural societies were preparing for the change of the seasons from summer to winter. Pagans believe this is a time when there's a thinning of the veil between the land of the living and the dead. Witches, Wiccans and other pagans observe Samhain during this time to celebrate the autumn harvest and the coming of winter. All Souls' also falls during the Islamic holy month of Muharram, when Shia Muslims prayerfully mourn the death of Hussain ibn Ali, the Prophet Muhammad's grandson.Also On HuffPost:"

A 2013 Gallup poll found that U.S. adults get an average of 6.8 hours of sleep a night -- more than an hour less per night than we got in the 1940s. And fully 40 percent of Americans are getting six hours of sleep or less every night. That's much less sleep than what experts recommend for most adults.Check our chart to see How Much Sleep You Need. Lack of sleep may not just be making you cranky and unable to concentrate. It could be one of the reasons why you're struggling to take off that extra five (or 10, or 20) pounds. Research suggests that there is a relationship between lack of sleep and weight gain -- and also, potentially, between lack of sleep and Type 2 diabetes. In one study, for example, men who had one night of significantly reduced sleep (four hours) felt hungrier, and consumed about 22 percent more calories, than men who got the optimal eight. Another found that sleep-deprived people strongly prefer high-calorie foods, like chocolate, potato chips and gooey desserts -- with brain scans showing that a night of little sleep leads to reduced activity in the areas of the brain that regulate decision-making, and intense activity in the brain's pleasure centers.  And larger studies have shown that both adults and children who are ""short sleepers"" have a greater risk of obesity.So what's going on here? It may have to do with the relationship between two hormones, ghrelin and leptin, which have been dubbed the ""hunger hormones."" Put simply, leptin puts the brakes on your food intake, signaling your brain to stop eating, while ghrelin, on the other hand, kick-starts the appetite. And sleep -- or the lack of it -- appears to affect the levels of leptin and ghrelin in the body. Even a single night of sleep deprivation appears to increase the levels of appetite-stimulating ghrelin, with the double whammy of lowering leptin levels. Now, let's be clear -- the science here is very intriguing, but it's still preliminary. Observational data and small studies do strongly suggest a correlation between lack of sleep and weight gain, and the ghrelin-leptin theory is a persuasive explanation for why that might be. But right now, we don't have any ""gold standard"" studies -- that is, randomized, double-blinded, and controlled studies -- to confirm this less weighty evidence. Honestly, it would be very hard to design such studies. And the relationship between sleep and metabolism is complex. While generally speaking, research does strongly point to a correlation between lack of sleep and weight gain, that may not be true for everyone. Sleep affects people differently.Still, getting a good night's sleep is good for your health anyway. Unlike fad or crash diets, appetite suppressant pills, and other less healthy ways of trying to take off a few pounds, striving for a good 7-9 hours of sleep a night can only benefit you, rather than harm you. Research suggests that people with disrupted sleep are two to three times more likely to have Type 2 diabetes, and a small recent study might help explain why. Researchers at the University of Chicago studied a group of 19 healthy men through two scenarios: in one, they got an average of 7.8 hours asleep for four consecutive nights, and in the other, they slept for an average of 4.3 hours for four consecutive nights.The results? The sleep-restricted group immediately had a spike in the overnight levels of fatty acids in the blood, as well as an increase in insulin resistance -- a hallmark of pre-diabetes -- that lasted for nearly five hours. Blood glucose levels didn't change, but the ability of insulin to do its job -- to regulate blood glucose levels -- dropped by about 23 percent after short sleep.Here again, we're talking about evidence that is observational, rather than from randomized, controlled studies. But as these pieces of evidence keep adding up, they are forming a consistent pattern that tells us that there's something about not getting enough sleep regularly that is bad for our health in many ways.Now, there are some reasons for sleep deprivation that are out of your control, like waking up with a new baby or a sick 5-year-old, or a work schedule that disrupts your nights. Or maybe you have insomnia for no apparent reason -- something to check out with your doctor. But let's be honest: Many of us are staying up too late when we don't really need to.

16,BUSINESS,The Great Remix: Why Mergers Are Booming,"Ben Gomes-Casseres, ContributorAuthor, 'REMIX STRATEGY'; Professor, Brandeis University Inter...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-great-remix-why-merge_b_8445144.html,"Another day, another merger. Telephone companies, drug companies, drugstores, airlines, hospitals, retail stores and beer. Why?",2015-11-01,2015-11-01-1446393213-5217304-pokerhandrankings.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-11-01-1446393213-5217304-pokerhandrankings-thumb.jpg,"Another day, another merger. Telephone companies, drug companies, drugstores, airlines, hospitals, retail stores, and beer. According to preliminary data from Thomson Reuters, $3.19 trillion in deals were announced so far in 2015. Mergers are booming in the United States, and globally too. Why?With the Great Recession (mostly) behind us, it is now time for the Great Remix. This merger mania is a remixing of the cards of business.At any point in the game of business, every company holds certain cards. Some of these cards are aces, like the patent on a blockbuster drug or the copyright on an essential piece of software. Most of the cards are less lofty assets -- factories, distribution outlets, brand names and teams of people with know-how.The most important game rule is this: With the exception of those aces, what each card is worth to a player depends on the other cards that player holds. In poker, if you hold the five, six, seven and eight of spades, getting that nine of spades gives you a straight flush -- not bad for a set of mundane cards!So it is with multibillion dollar mergers. Office Depot's assets are worth a modest amount to its investors -- but to Staples they are worth much more. Why? Because Staples believes that by ""remixing"" these Office Depot assets with its own, it can lower costs, gain market share and get cash to invest in its online business. Their proposed merger is now being reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission to see whether it will help or hurt consumers.Most mergers today are not about growth for the sake of growth. They are not about holding more cards in your hand but about assembling a more valuable collection of cards. The claim is usually that the combination will be more profitable than the separate businesses. The shorthand for this idea is 1+1=3. That's one of laws that dictate success in any business combination.In today's fast-paced, interconnected business environment, this remixing of assets has become fundamental to competitive advantage. When done for the right reasons, these combinations bring in new ideas, provide access to new capabilities and markets and let companies leverage what they do best. That is why mergers are hot today.And it's not only mergers that are used to achieve these goals. An alliance between Apple and IBM. A joint venture of Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline. A partnership of Oxfam and Marks & Spencer. A consortium of General Electric and internet-of-things players Verizon, Intel and Cisco. Joint development by NASA and SpaceX. All these deals involve collaboration between firms, but they are short of A full merger. They all aim to create value by the 1+1=3 formula. It's just the organizational tools that differ.Business combinations such as these have long been recognized as a key factor in competition and innovation. The first to see this relationship was Joseph Schumpeter, the great political economist of the early 20th century. He described how the normal routine of a business could be upended by new combinations of the elements of the business. Entrepreneurs, he argued, are the ones who made these new combinations -- combinations of existing and new manufacturing processes, of markets and new sources of supply, of new products and technologies and even of new corporate structures and strategies. These new combinations were at the heart of his theory of innovation.Schumpeter's observations still describe what is now happening all around us -- but today, it is not only start-up entrepreneurs who are coming up with the new combinations. Executives in established companies are now driving this innovation process too. The last decade has seen a proliferation of strategies of this sort -- strategies that combine assets and resources from inside and outside of a company. The details of these combinations vary: they may be temporary or permanent, be governed by a loose or an iron-clad contract, be exclusive or not and so on. But, fundamentally, they all seek to create value by combining resources and know-how from separate firms.Because these strategies can rapidly transform a business, mergers and partnerships often spread like wildfire. Whenever key players in an industry begin to use business combinations for one reason or another, their rivals often are not far behind. This pattern happened in airlines, computers, pharmaceuticals, banking, media, communications and other industries.Why? It's not just management fashion -- there is method to the madness.The simplest explanation of these waves of business combinations is that firms are reacting to fundamental changes in their business environment. For example, the passage of the Affordable Care Act has created new incentives for hospital mergers, as well as consolidation in other medical products and services. In the Internet of Things, new technologies drive alliances in mobile computing and help vendors connect their devices so that we can track our energy usage or our health in real time.Another reason for what seems like copy-cat behavior is in fact just that: Firms often follow each other's strategic moves. Doing so might lower a firm's chances of moving ahead or -- more importantly -- falling behind its rivals. So when one telecom company tied up with another, others often followed suit. Sometimes, firms don't wait to copy others, because being first may well be the key to success. By tying up good partners early, these firms also hope to block rivals from joining the dance.Why should you care about these deals? Of course, you want to know where to shop for ink cartridges, and you want the new mega hospitals and airlines to serve you better, cheaper and faster. Whether the new combined enterprises can do so depends on whether they can make that 1+1=3 actually come true.That ultimate outcome depends on another funny math formula: 1+1=1. This is the second law of success. By this I mean that the combined entity, partnership or alliance really needs to be managed as if it were one. It might need to present one face to the customer and have a well-coordinated operation behind the scenes. In other words, it must pay careful attention to playing its full hand of cards.Some will fail at this game -- almost half of mergers and partnerships don't reach their goals. However, those that succeed can transform our world. Think of Disney's entry into computer animation. Before Disney worked with Pixar on ""Toy Story,"" it had failed to understand how to make this new technology work. The companies worked together as partners for years before Disney acquired Pixar for $7.4 billion. In the process, Disney/Pixar produced a string of blockbuster movies that delight viewers worldwide. Similar stories lie behind other successful combinations, from new medicines to the smartphone technologies that keep us connected today.So when a new merger is announced, its impact on our world is not yet in the cards. That outcome lies in how the new owners remix their cards and play their new hand."

The DeKalb County grand jury said the district attorney shouldn't indict DeKalb Officer Joseph Pitts for the December killing of Kevin Davis, 44, who had called 911 seeking help because his girlfriend had been stabbed. Davis remained on the line with the emergency operator when he heard gunshots at his home. Pitts had killed his dog, claiming later that the animal was a threat. Not knowing the source of the gunfire, Davis grabbed his own gun and went to investigate, his girlfriend said. In an ensuing confrontation, Pitts shot Davis.Davis' family has said the officer didn't give him ample warning before firing. Davis' girlfriend said she thinks Davis had armed himself because of the attack on her.District Attorney Robert James may accept or ignore the grand jury's recommendation. In a statement, he said he hadn't decided how he would proceed in Davis's case. In the second cace, the grand jury called for renewed investigation into the March fatal shooting by a white officer of Anthony Hill, 27, a nude, black man who police said was acting erratically. Officer Robert Olsen saw Hill in a parking lot and said he shot when Hill charged at him. Hill was unarmed. Hill's family members said they believe a bipolar spell took control of Hill, an Air Force veteran. Grand jurors said ""inconsistencies and contradictions"" in witness testimony prevented them from making a recommendation to the district attorney on whether to pursue charges against Olsen. The jury urged a follow-up interview with the first officer on the scene and a thorough interview with another officer to clarify the accuracy of previous statements. The district attorney said he'd consider the suggestions. "

""That raises a question, because I'm wondering, why it isn't Hillary for African Americans?"" Avery Jackson, one of the students, told The Huffington Post. ""Because that's the issue. She continues to exploit the spaces that black people value.""""She doesn't really express the centering and prioritizing of black issues, which are at the root American issues,"" he continued. ""I think we see that with the campaign -- that she sees the issues of black people outside of the American agenda.""Clinton was at the university to unveil her criminal justice reform plan. She has been heavily criticized during the campaign for her past support for tough-on-crime initiatives that facilitated mass incarceration.Though Clinton acknowledges her missteps on this issue, Jackson said Clinton isn't offering any concrete ways to fix the problem or reverse the damage that has been done.""She talks about prison reform and changing lives moving forward, but I honestly think there's a conversation that needs to be centered around the lives that her and her husband have ruined,"" he said, referring to the effects of strict criminal justice policies implemented by the Bill Clinton administration.""At this point, rhetoric is not enough. We need to see action,"" he added.The protests at Friday's rally appeared to be organized in part by historically black colleges in the Atlanta University Center Consortium, which represents Spelman College, Morehouse College, Clark Atlanta University and the Interdenominational Theological Center. A Twitter account affiliated with the movement, which calls itself the AUC Shut It Down coalition, posted a statement Friday afternoon saying, ""We charge the administration, law enforcement, and collective student bodies of the Atlanta University Center (AUC) for the multiple offenses committed against black and brown lives.""Activist Shiranthi Goonathilaka told HuffPost she had expected to see an actual policy platform today instead of more rhetoric.""Even though we interrupted her, she still didn't lay out what that plan was. She just kept on saying little sound bites of how she understands the problem and [how] we need to fix them,"" she said. Goonathilaka added that African Americans aren't responsible for coming up with solutions for criminal justice reform, even though activists would be involved in the conversation.""Hillary Clinton is running for president of the United States. She has to come up with ways to claim what she wants to happen to really happen,"" she said.Jackson said the reason Clinton is being targeted is because she ""continues to come into our spaces and continues to press this PR agenda to gain black votes. At some point we have to ... step up and realize that PR is not enough to save us.""He also criticized the other Democratic front-runners for marginalizing black people. ""Black people are Americans.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Saturday called the CNBC moderators of Wednesday's Republican debate “left-wing operatives” who are trying to sabotage the party’s chances of taking the White House next year.“What you have is a bunch of left-wing operatives whose object is that whoever the Republican nominee is, they want him as battered and bruised as possible so the Democrat wins in November,” Cruz said at the Iowa GOP’s Growth and Opportunity Forum on Saturday. The Texas senator and presidential candidate suggested that moderators who have voted Republican should host future debates.“If you’re not making the decisions yourself, if you’re not a conservative, if you haven’t known many conservatives, the questions you ask are not the questions that actually conservative voters care about,” he explained.“How about instead of a bunch of attack journalists, we actually have real conservatives,” he added as the crowd cheered. “Could you imagine a debate moderated by Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin?”Following his speech, he told reporters he was disappointed that CNBC did not pose questions on crucial economic issues, adding that the moderators never even mentioned the Affordable Care Act. He put the blame partly on media ratings.“I recognize media companies like to sell commercials and making a big food fight and getting everyone to insult each other is a lot of fun and will sell commercials,” he said. “I think primary voters want help making decisions and comparing the records, comparing the visions, comparing the policies of different candidates.”Cruz’s comments come after the Republican National Committee pulled out of a future debate with CNBC's parent network NBC amid criticism of this week’s debate.According to a new Bloomberg/Des Moines Register poll, Cruz is picking up steam in Iowa, placing third behind Ben Carson and Donald Trump. After a widely praised debate performance in Colorado, voters gave the senator a lot of attention, many pledging to caucus for him.“I feel like he could win the Iowa caucus,” said Benjamin Dorin, a 25-year-old supporter from Pleasant Hill. “It’s not necessarily because he is well known but he is the brightest and the smartest of all of them politically. I’m confident that the rest of America will catch on.”Less than 24 hours after the CNBC debate, the Cruz campaign announced it raised $1.1 million. Cruz' website actually crashed during the debate because the web traffic was so high, he said.“That is a very real manifestation of the energy, of the excitement and enthusiasm,” he said.Republican strategist and former party chair Matt Strawn said Cruz’s campaign is in a good spot at this point in the cycle.""The sky’s the limit for Cruz in Iowa if he can successfully consolidate Iowa’s evangelical tea party and liberty-oriented voting block,"" he explained. ""Is he there yet? No. Is he well-positioned three months out? Yes.""Describing his strategy in Iowa, Cruz spoke to the value of time and patience.""In every election cycle there are candidates that shoot to the top and fall down just as quickly,” he said. “Our strategy has always been to build on a foundation of rock and not on sand. To play the long game built on fundamentals and deep support from the grassroots.”Also on HuffPost: "

Rubio added: ""Resources alone are not enough ... but we're grateful to have his help, obviously.""Rubio, Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and several other Republican candidates had eagerly sought Singer's support, the Times said.In the letter, Singer described Rubio as the only candidate who can ""navigate this complex primary process, and still be in a position to defeat"" Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the November 2016 general election.Singer gave more money to Republican candidates and causes last year than any donor in the country, the Times said, citing the Center for Responsive Politics.He is courted by Republicans both for his willingness to give and for his network of fellow conservative donors, the newspaper reported.The Times did not say how much Singer intended to donate to Rubio, who is coming off a strong debate performance on Wednesday night in Colorado.Rubio is third behind businessman Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson in a Real Clear Politics average of national opinion polls for the Republican race.Bush, who is in fifth place in the polling and recently downsized his campaign staff, gave what is widely viewed as a lackluster performance in the debate."

While Maher has expressed clearly negative feelings about Trump in the past, he did reveal one thing he appreciates about the candidate.""Trump [was] the only guy who was honest,"" Maher said to his panelists. ""He said, 'I don't forgive.' I love Trump for that. He's like, I don't forgive. You fuck with me, I'm Vito Corleone, I will follow you back to Italy. I will find you in your old age and I will stick a knife in your stomach.'""Back in September, Maher called out Trump's ignorant comments about undocumented workers by channeling him in a segment jokingly telling Americans to rally against Australians ""taking"" our jobs. ""Australia is not sending us its best people,"" he said. ""They’re bringing drugs -- yes, enough for everybody, but still -- they’re rapists -- OK, not rapists, but they do a lot of fucking -- and I assume some are good people.""Sigh. It's not too surprising that Maher had trouble finding something about Trump to like.CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that ""Real Time"" airs on Saturday.Also on HuffPost: "
