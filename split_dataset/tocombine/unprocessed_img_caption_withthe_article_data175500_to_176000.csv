(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb23705240000510055788b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Frighteningly during last week's debate with President Obama Mitt Romney, directing his comments at the moderator Jim Lehrer pontificated:I'm sorry Jim I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS (public broadcasting) . I'M GOING TO STOP OTHER THINGS (my emphasis)...I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow from money from China to pay for it.Inevitably and frighteningly the NEA will be on Romney's list to ""STOP OTHER THINGS"". I say inevitably because Romney has already declared himself on this issue. In an op-ed piece penned by Romney for USA Today (""How Ill Tackle Spending, Debt"" 11.03.11) he categorically stated:The Federal Government should stop doing things we don't need and can't afford. For example:...An aside. The budget of the NEA is $169 million, very small potatoes in terms of government largess. Gratingly, it is less than the $242 million (eight times the investment -- and but one example) Mr. Romney's Bain Capital earned in its takeover of the medical company Dade International, a company that was ultimately forced into bankruptcy (please see ""After a Romney Deal, Profits and Then Layoffs"" New York Times, 11.12.11)   The suppression of the NEA, the NEH and PBS would be a cultural and spiritual disaster for the nation. The arts and our respect and nurturing of the arts is key to our lives as Americans. The arts help define our lives and are essential to a dimension of America that has always been great in spirit, our willingness to go beyond the rote and routine, to define new dimensions in ourselves giving us new vistas of entrepreneurship and the confidence to accept risk because we have been tutored in creativity and its wonders.  Please understand I do not say this idly. During Ronald Reagan's presidency I served on the National Council of the Arts as one of President Reagan's appointees. Governor Romney may call himself a Republican, but he is not a Republican of the iconic stature of President Reagan. President Reagan fully understood the importance of the arts to the formation of the nation's character. He understood that the National Endowment for the Arts and the NEH were our government's badge of honor in support of the arts and that his administration would be judged in meaningful dimension by his support for the arts through its support of the NEA and the NEH. From the outset of his presidency, he was personally engaged in supporting the NEA and appointed a close associate, Frank Hodsoll, its Chairman, who performed brilliantly and had open access to the White House.  In simply economic terms it is amazing that a financial engineer of Romney's experience at Bain fails to understand the leverage the arts have had on entire communities, and how they further the economic well being of the nation. One need only consider the beneficial gentrification of entire neighborhoods once close to the abyss, and entire towns and cities whose character has been transformed by the cluster of artists who have gathered to take up residence to form communities of skilled artisans. Of the millions of museum visitors and the hundreds of thousands of Americans in gainful employment in managing and operating these treasured institutions. The wonderful sprawl of art galleries, concert halls, public theaters, and so on. How diminished our lives would be without them.  No, Mr. Romney, we are not borrowing money from China to pay for this part of our lives though we would happily learn from them and from other cultures as they do from ours. The arts are not an American enterprise to be outsourced to China, or India, or wherever, as so many viable companies have been by the financial engineers. The arts are part of our heritage and their sustenance and support is an inherent responsibility to those elected to the bar of the nation's governance."

If a team’s no huddle doesn’t click, it gives the ball",2012-10-07,"DENVER, CO - SEPTEMBER 23: Quarterback Peyton Manning #18 of the Denver Broncos runs the offense against the Houston Texans at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on September 23, 2012 in Denver, Colorado. The Texans defeated the Broncos 31-25. (Photo by Doug Pensinger/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6b6c81f0000df0024da75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dan Pompei, National Football Post  If this season’s most interesting trend continues, ten years from now we may be talking about huddles the way we talk about single-bar facemasks. That’s because the use of the no huddle is skyrocketing this year.After four weeks of play, 14.6 percent of all snaps have been in no huddle this year, according to STATS. Last year, only 9.3 percent of snaps were from no huddle. In 2008, the percentage was 7.1.And this isn’t just offenses trying to play catchup as the clock winds down. Outside of the last three minutes of the half, offenses have taken 13.9 percent of their snaps from no huddle.“It’s a trend,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh told me. “A lot of people are doing it.”Rat race offense, I call it.The team that has used it more than any other, surprise, surprise, is the Dolphins. With rookie Ryan Tannehill operating almost the same offense he ran at Texas A&M, the Dolphins have gone no huddle an astounding 61.8 percent of the time.Next are the Ravens (54.2 percent), Broncos (45.6 percent), Patriots (32.8 percent), Packers (29.3 percent), Eagles (23.8 percent), Lions (20 percent), Chiefs 19.8 percent), Steelers (18.7 percent) and Falcons (18.5 percent).What is behind this strong trend? The no huddle is the perfect antidote for complex defenses because it limits what defenses can do, both in terms of personnel substitutions and exotic looks.“It makes defenses a little uncomfortable and creates a faster pace for them to operate under,” Harbaugh said. “The calls come faster. It’s harder for them to match personnel sometimes. It happens a lot faster.”One coach not quoted here told me he might use only 15 percent of his usual defensive game plan against a good no huddle offense. It can force a defense to play almost a base package.“Normally when you are facing a no huddle offense as a defensive coach, it can shrink the volume you can have in your game plan,” Falcons coach Mike Smith said.What’s more it wears out defenders, especially pass rushers. Defensive players lose 10 to 15 seconds of recovery time per play against a no huddle offense.The flip side of the no huddle is it can wear out its own defense. If a team’s no huddle doesn’t click, it gives the ball back to the opponent before the defense gets a chance to regroup and recover. That’s why some defensive coaches are known to lobby against the no huddle.Harbaugh looks at it this way. “If our defense gets them off in three and we get first downs on offense, it’s not going to be a problem and that’s the same huddle or no huddle,” he said. “If you can’t get off the field, it’s going to be a problem on defense, and if you can’t get first downs on offense it’s going to be a problem regardless.”There’s more to the latest no huddle craze though. NFL never has been about scoring more than it is today. And the no huddle is a great way to score more. NFL teams are more concerned about their offenses than their defenses. The no huddle gives offenses chances for more plays, and chances for more plays are chances for more points.Not every team can operate a no huddle efficiently though. Former Bengals coach Sam Wyche, who really began the no huddle trend, once told me the key to it is you need a very smart quarterback who can be a field general and not lose composure. The league is getting more and more players who fit that description.That’s why it makes sense that young passers who are coming into their own like Baltimore’s Joe Flacco and Atlanta’s Matt Ryan are leading the no huddle revolution. Quarterbacks who have a complete command of their offense are in better position to take advantage of the freedom at the line the no huddle offers.“Matt has a very good comfort level with it,” Smith said. “You allow the quarterback to put you in a play based on what the defense presents, and Matt is good at that.”Andrew Luck’s Colts have run the no huddle only 4.5 percent of the time, but you know a lot more no huddle is in their future. The Colts have averaged 15 yards per play from no huddle, compared to 7.3 yards per play when they have huddled.Other teams that have fared much better with the no huddle than without it are Tony Romo’s Cowboys (9.8 yards to 7.1), Peyton Manning’s Broncos (7.9 yards to 6.2) and Aaron Rodgers’ Packers (7.2 yards to 5.7).Those quarterbacks and others like them are convincing coaches all around the league that they should join the rat race.Things I Didn’t Used To Know*Trent Richardson looks like he’s going to be more than a fine running back for the Browns. He also looks like he’s going to be a fine leader. A couple of weeks ago, he asked linebacker and respected vet D’Qwell Jackson if he could say a few words to the team. Jackson obliged and Richardson called out some of the veterans for accepting losing. That might not have gone over so well coming from most rookies, but it went over well from Richardson because he has walked the walk. Other players couldn’t help but notice the times when Richardson has had to be pulled out of the weight room because trainers worry he might be working too hard. They also admire how Richardson often gains yards on his own, even when his blockers fail him.*Matt Hasselbeck couldn’t save the Titans last week, but that doesn’t mean he won’t give them a shot in the arm in the absence of Jake Locker. The word from the locker room is the Titans still believe the 37-year old Hasselbeck can help them win games for a short stretch. Locker had outplayed Hasselbeck in camp and clearly is the better option over a long season, but the belief in Tennessee is Hasselbeck can get the Titans through a stretch of time.My Sunday Best: No-Huddle QuarterbacksTwo of the greatest no huddle quarterbacks in history will face off in Foxboro Sunday. They have shown us all how it’s done. Jim Kelly and Boomer Esiason should be watching from a skybox at Gillette Stadium. They were great ones for running the no huddle. Here are my best no huddle quarterbacks in the league today.1. Tom Brady—He is in a groove with the no huddle like no other quarterback because he has been doing it for so long and in the same system and with many of the same players. His aptitude for finding the weakness in a defense may be unmatched.2. Peyton Manning—In his prime he took the no huddle to another level. He still is outstanding at it, but is getting used to new surroundings. He is the all-time master of presnap adjustments. Manning rarely loses those chess games.3. Aaron Rodgers—He enjoys being the aggressor, and he uses the whole field and all of his options in the no huddle as well as anyone. The Packers are using more no huddle this year.4. Matt Ryan—He has been operating the no huddle since his second NFL game, but he really has come into his own lately as a premier operator of the no huddle.5. Joe Flacco—The Ravens QB has a complete command of the offense at this stage of his career and has been outstanding in the no huddle so far. Given his physical tools, in time he could be as good as any no huddle quarterback.6. Ben Roethlisberger—The Steelers don’t use the no huddle as much as some team, but Roethlisberger runs it well as a change of pace.7. Carson Palmer. He did quite a bit of no huddle back in his Bengals days, and he remains highly proficient at it in Oakland.8. Matthew Stafford—The Lions offense has been out of sync this year, but Stafford is a dangerous no huddle passer who can put a defense on its heels.One Man Yelp: Men of SundayMost of the time when pro athletes talk about their faith, the media ignores them. Curtis Eichelberger decided to swim against the stream when he wrote an enlightening book about Christians in the NFL called Men of Sunday: How Faith Guides The Players, Coaches & Wives Of The NFL.He delves into the experiences of Ray Lewis, Mike Singletary, Les Frazier, Trent Dilfer, LaDainian Tomlinson, Andy Reid, Mark Brunell, Matt Hasselbeck and many others. He covers the gamut from pre-game prayers to post-game on-field prayers, from team bible studies to temptations from groupies. The book discusses the unique challenges NFL players face regarding to their faith, but it also presents those challenges in terms we all can relate to.It’s an interesting read that covers a lot of ground fans rarely are exposed to. This isn’t about players thinking they can defeat opponents because God is on their side. But it is about players obtaining a perspective through their faith that can help them weather storms.Singletary talks about wrestling with the concept of being a Christian and playing a violent game, and how frightened he was the time he thought one of his vicious hits might have had an unspeakable consequence for running back Sylvester Stamps. Said Singletary, “I thought to myself, ‘What am I doing?’ Something is wrong with this.’”When Reid took over the Eagles in 1999, he was told he had a team full of soft “Bible Bangers.” He recoiled at the notion. “I firmly believe if Christ came back today and decided He wanted to play this game, He’d be our middle linebacker,” Reid said. “He’d be the toughest guy on the field. So I don’t’ buy that ‘Bible Banger’ image.”Men of Sunday is a quick, easy read that is well worth the time.Hot Reads*It’s been heartening to see people from all corners of the NFL expressing concern and encouragement to Chuck Pagano. But it hasn’t been surprising. He’s that kind of man.*If this is the case, Chris Johnson, the Titans have their pay structure all messed up.*It’s a long way from Missouri Western State to the NFL. But Greg “The Leg” Zuerlein has a way of making a long way seem not so far.*As my guy Pat Yasinskas suggests,it’s time for Cam Newton to get off the roller coaster.*If you want to get inside the head of one of the NFL’s greatest pass rushers, check this out from Chip Scoggins.*I highly recommend these quarterback rankings from the guru Ron Jaworski.*Gary Shelton, as usual, provides excellent perspective here on Greg Schiano’s start in Tampa.*Tim Tebow might want to keep that arm loose. Brady Quinn too. And Matt Flynn as well.*And when Mike Tannenbaum says there is no pressure from above to play Tebow, that tells me you might not be listening when he says his prayers.Dan Pompei covers pro football for the Chicago Tribune at chicagotribune.com.

Thanks to days of commuting and nights with Agatha Christie, Billy Wilder and Ayn Rand, there is no doubt that I love trains. More comfortable than a car and far more elegant than an airplane, trains have always been my preferred method of travel, and perhaps one of the reasons I love living in Europe.When in college, I spent my weekends in Fascist-era stations waiting for inter-city and regional trains as I counted the kilometers of my Ferrovia dello Stato kilometric pass, aka Eurail-cheap. And as I grew up, I grew into Trenitalia's Frecciarossa and particular fondness for the AltaVelocità (high speed). Later I found that bringing babies across borders is much less stressful in trains of any model. To be honest, even though I have acted like a Trenitalia poster child for years, I was one of the first to step up to the yellow line when Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori (NTV) launched Italo this past spring. Founded by a quartet of Italy's best in business, privately-owned Italo has been hyped as the rival to state-run Trenitalia. Coming from the other side of the tracks, Italo may have been conceived as ""the people's train,"" but with two of its founders being ""Made-in-Italy"" magnates -- Ferrari Chairman Luca Montezemolo and Tod's Diego della Valle -- Italo is upping the elegance ante in inter-regional commuting. Think Milan Fashion Week with magnet synchronous motors.From my first journey, it is obvious that Italo is the full package, a sleek, needled-nosed racer with great personality and sexy interior design. On board and at the station, Italo's crew is young, friendly and multilingual. Props definitely to Montezemolo and crew as Italo has created over 1,000 positions.Turin-based furniture manufacturer Poltrona Frau outfitted the Smart, Prima and Club cars with leather recliners, and in the case of Club (first class), a leather-walled private cabin. (Poltrona Frau's other clients include Bugatti, Ferrari and Maserati.) Though sadly Italo has left dining cars by the wayside, NTV recruited Eataly, Italy's super fab Made-in-Italy supermarket, to cater in-seat lunch boxes.Touch-screen TVs, private valets, sitting rooms, a conversation and cell-phone free Relax car and a Cinema car make up a single train. Prices are competitive with Trenitalia, but Italo's customer service -- such as the literal up-to-the-last-minute changes and easy to reach/understand phone operators -- is far better. I made four changes -- three last minute in-station and one over the phone -- without incurring a fee or frustration.Will Italo push Trenitalia off the tracks? I don't think so. Right now, Italo runs just a wee bit faster, looks better and is easier. However, its menu of cities only includes Turin, Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples and Bologna. Eventually they'll add Salerno, Padova and Venice.Although Italo stops in some seemingly less busy stations such as Rome's Tiburtina and Milan's Porta Garibaldi, the stations are not in the center of either city, making an impatient traveler like myself even more so. But thanks must be given to NTV for to bringing back rail sophistication, not only to its trains but to Trenitalia as well, which has begun an overhaul of both rail and customer service. All aboard!"

Those words confirmed for me the stigma of being illegitimate. I know, because I am a secret love child.I was raised in an upper middle class family in upstate New York. As the middle child of three, I always knew something was ""off"" in my family. Intuitively, I felt I was the problem -- that things would be better between my parents if I wasn't there. My father did not treat me with the love he had for my brother and sister. Sometimes, the awareness that I didn't fit in made me feel like I was in the wrong house with the wrong family. Life at home became unbearable because I felt I wasn't wanted. Having remarkable survival instincts and a strong work ethic, I moved out on my own at a very young age and became self-supporting. Neither of my parents balked at my decision in my teens, which further validated my inclinations. I put myself through college and fell into a lucrative career. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was an outcast, despite continually seeking out a sense of belonging. By this point, I was well into using food and alcohol to fill the void I was born with.I found myself in a 12-step recovery program at the age of 23. Finally, I'd found my place amongst strangers who understood me, and I belonged. However, the recovery process stresses that self-centeredness was the nature of our dilemma. Again, I must be the problem. There had to be a solution.At 25 I entered into a marriage that was doomed from the start. I was choosing from a wounded place and just didn't know it. By 31, I found myself alone with two babies under the age of two. It was just before my thirty-second birthday when who I was came to me. Literally, it came to me.During a massage, while in a dream-like state, I heard a conversation between my parents. I immediately phoned my father from Boca Raton, where I was living. He had found his own 12-step recovery for alcoholism by this time, and we had begun to mend our relationship. I told him about this ""dream."" I asked him if he had ever wondered whether or not I was his child, at which point he became very emotional. He shared that he had carried secret doubts for over three decades. He agreed to DNA testing, and I flew back to my hometown within days. Three weeks later the results confirmed that I was not his. Rather, I was the product of a four-year affair between my mother and his boss, who was also his good friend. During my mom's pregnancy with me, he had confronted her because he didn't feel the same connection that he had during their first pregnancy with my sister. Mom told him he must be crazy, and he carried guilt for not believing her. The DNA results were an ""ah-ha"" moment-for both of us. The truth set us free. Now I could start to trust my instincts. There was a lot of work ahead to heal these wounds, but my parents -- who had divorced by this time -- were committed to healing our relationships.A short time later, the father of my children left the area and stayed away. Seemingly, I had created a parallel situation for my own two children, who now had no father figure. I couldn't help but wonder if being alone was my destiny.I contacted my biological father, and he refused to admit that he was my parent. My own father, who was now ""Dad-not,"" stepped into my life and the lives of my children as a grandparent extraordinaire -- and in this way, made his living amends to me for not being a parent during my childhood, when I was the scapegoat and misfit and didn't know why.My Dad-not passed in 2010 after becoming my best friend and a remarkable role model to my son and daughter. Meanwhile, I had to forgive my mother for keeping my origin a secret. After intense therapy, I realized that in 1961 (the year I was born) she was in a lose-lose situation as a Catholic. Leaving her marriage to be with her lover was taboo; keeping the fact I was a love child a secret was practically a societal requirement.Miraculously, and with a great deal of introspective work in recovery, I became the parent I never had. The greatest blessings in my life are my 21-year-old son, Brit, and 22-year-old daughter, Jane. They are the fuel that drives my unstoppable commitment to break the dysfunctional family dynamics in which I was raised. My book, >Ellen Who? Story of a Secret Love Child, tells the in-depth story of my experience being a secret love child. With my instincts in conflict with the facts, I was inherently wired not to trust myself. After all that has occurred, my definition of success is what a person decides to become in spite of their life circumstances. I am no longer an overeater, and haven't consumed alcohol in twenty-seven years.  Everyone has secrets, but being the secret is much different. A love child is the walking evidence and reminder of our parent's adultery. Being born as a result of an affair affects one's entire identity and origin, with effects that are beyond explanation. In many situations, fear prevents people from facing their wrongs and taking full responsibility. Additionally, the biological parent may have so much shame that they unknowingly transfer that onto the love child. I suspect this is why the subject of love children is not talked about too much; my hope is that the discussion will begin now."

Right now in the U.S., primary-school students are tightening their backpack straps. They'll learn colors and numbers, history, the building blocks of science. They'll learn how to read and write. This is also a month when our world leaders will gather in New York for the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly, where the subject of school will be on the agenda.Thanks in part to a renewed focus on primary education, set forth with the second United Nations Millennium Development Goal (MDG), school has now become a reality for millions of new students around the world, with significant improvements in global enrollment and completion rates over the past decade.As a result, the horizons of those bound for school are now dramatically brightened. Whether or not we can see it just yet, statistics show that the opportunities these children will have as adults are now more promising than they were prior to becoming students.Yet despite these vast improvements, critical challenges persist. The number of children who remain out of school is diminishing too slowly to meet MDG 2 by 2015. According to a United Nations report, as of 2010, about 69 million school-age children were not in school. Almost half of them were in Sub-Saharan Africa.However, the efforts made by many countries in sub-Saharan Africa to improve the percentage of children in school, coupled with rapid population growth, have resulted in more students than ever before, which has led to a whole host of infrastructure problems brought on by a surge in enrollment. The types of problems we now face include teacher shortages and a lack of suitable classrooms and educational materials. In fact, estimates suggest we would need double the number of teachers in sub-Saharan Africa today to meet the 2015 goals.While getting children enrolled is an important aim, keeping young people in school is equally important. The United Nations reports that dropout rates in sub-Saharan Africa remain staggeringly high, with more than 30 percent of students dropping out before graduating primary school.So we must still wrestle with the issues before us. Fixing this problem is twofold, and it's an undertaking that the Oando Foundation takes very seriously. In Nigeria, where we work, we are squarely focused on getting African children into primary school and making sure that what awaits them is rewarding, competitive, and productive. Above all, we need to ensure that they stay.The cornerstone of the Oando Foundation's education initiative is our Adopt-a-School Program, which works hand in hand with the Nigerian government on the development of adopted government-owned primary schools. We are renovating facilities, building teacher capacity, securing learning aids, providing training in information and communications technology (ICT), and supporting libraries. The aim is to adopt at least 100 primary schools across West Africa by 2015.Today, our challenge is much greater than simply enrolling young people into classrooms. It is determining the most efficient distribution of resources to keep them in school and ensure that they receive a quality education. We are hopeful that the international community will join us in marshaling resources not only to bring children to the classroom but also to ensure that they complete their education and have a positive experience while doing it.The imperative for primary-school education is not esoteric. The World Bank and many others widely acknowledge it is the driving force behind reducing poverty, diminishing child mortality, promoting gender parity, and sustaining economic growth. Simply, the future of our global community depends on it.In 2035 these children will be adults, and it will be time for them to live and serve as mature members of society. The decisions we make today will inform the reasonable expectations we can have for them.What can we hope for the 69 million children who will not attend school this month? What can we rightly expect of them in years to come?"

Kurt Mix, of Katy, Texas was arrested on charges of intentionally destroying evidence. He faces two counts of obstruction of justice.

(FACTBOX at )In a bipartisan letter - a rare sight ahead of the Nov. 6 presidential elections - eight senators told Obama they are worried the Justice Department is considering allowing the bulk of fines to be assessed under the Oil Pollution Act for damages assessed to the coastline, with a minority of fines assessed for damages under the Clean Water Act.Fines arising from Clean Water Act violations could reach $21 billion, if BP is found to be grossly negligent of causing the April 20, 2010, explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 rig workers and unleashed 4.9 million barrels of oil that soiled the shorelines of four Gulf Coast states. BP has adamantly denied any accusations of gross negligence, and declined to comment on the senators' letter.Without the bill, federal Clean Water Act fines would have gone straight to the U.S. Treasury. Anywhere from $4 billion to $16.8 billion could flow into states' coffers under the bill's terms.The Mobile (Alabama) Press-Register first reported the proposed deal earlier this week, citing unnamed officials who had been briefed by the Justice Department.The potential settlement could be attractive to BP, because fines under the Oil Pollution Act are treated more favorably by the U.S. tax code than are Clean Water Act fines, congressional sources said.""Not only would the federal government have final say as to what qualified as environmental damage but BP, who is responsible for this, would also get a tax deduction that could write off millions,"" Representative Jo Bonner, an Alabama Republican, told Reuters. ""The audacity of giving BP a tax write-off.""A Justice Department spokesman had no comment on either negotiations nor the criticisms from elected officials.Senators told Obama the trade-off would mean less money allocated through a formula lawmakers negotiated in the RESTORE Act, legislation which puts decisions on how the money is spent in the hands of states and local governments.""Circumventing the will of Congress by short changing the RESTORE Act is wholly unacceptable to us. We urge you to reject such an approach,"" said the letter, signed late on Friday by Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, and Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, who co-authored the legislation.Shelby is concerned that Alabama's two coastal counties could lose out on planned recovery projects if the settlement was skewed toward Oil Pollution Act damage assessments, aides told Reuters.""We urge you to negotiate a robust settlement that does not achieve a higher amount under one of these statutes at the expense of the other,"" said the letter, also signed by Florida senators Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat.Republicans Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and John Cornyn of Texas also signed the letter.Louisiana, which bore the brunt of environmental damage from the spill, expects to be compensated for damages regardless of the legal means, said Garret Graves, senior environmental advisor to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.""Every statistic that's out there in regard to the impact of the spill clearly points to a disproportionate impact on the state of Louisiana, and Louisiana's focus will be ensuring that we fulfill our legal obligation to address all of these impacts to the Gulf,"" Graves said.

There was an interesting article posted on Bloomberg this week by Peter Robison. This article discussed a problem within our economy that Farr, Miller and Washington have been highlighting for several years now. The problem is the growing income disparity between the rich and the ""not rich."" The unmistakable reality is that the middle class has not benefited much from the economic growth we have seen, not only since the Great Recession, but also for the past two or three decades. More and more of the aggregate wealth and income in the country is accruing to the relatively well-to-do. This long-term trend had been masked by the rapid expansion of credit up until the credit crisis. In other words, many moderate-income people were still able to buy most of the things they wanted to buy until recently. These folks were unable to cover their expenditures through income growth, so they chose to take on more debt to support their expenditures. The credit crisis we experienced a few years ago reflects this trend: Middle-class Americans were simply on an unsustainable path with regard to taking on debt to support unaffordable lifestyles. Putting all political bickering aside, the continued disparity in wealth and income is not a healthy thing for the long-term growth of the economy. The economy can only grow at its potential if there is a large pool of consumers that is both willing and able to spend money to drive that economic growth. The increased spending we had seen up until the financial crisis was largely driven by the expansion of credit rather than widespread growth in income. And the growth in incomes and spending we've seen since the financial crisis has been driven by those at the top. The Bloomberg article said, ""The earnings gap between rich and poor Americans was the widest in more than four decades in 2011, Census data show, surpassing income inequality previously reported in Uganda and Kazakhstan."" The article goes on to say:In 2010, the top 1 percent of U.S. families captured as much as 93 percent of the nation's income growth, according to a March paper by Emmanuel Saez, a University of California at Berkeley economist who studied Internal Revenue Service Data.""Not surprisingly, this issue is taking center stage in this year's presidential election. Republicans argue that a stronger private sector is the answer to the problem of inequality. They argue that government spending and taxes should be cut so that private industry can create more jobs, effectively lifting up the middle class in a process known during the Reagan administration as ""trickle-down economics."" Democrats, for their part, advocate a more direct redistribution of wealth through heavier taxes on the rich and more direct government support to those of lesser means. While tempted, our objective is not to pick sides in this debate. Rather, we simply want to make the point that the trends leading up to the financial crisis continue today. The only difference now is that many of those needing or wanting credit are unable to get loans. This means that these people cannot spend as freely as they used to, and the onus of economic growth has been placed solely on the relatively few at the top of the wealth and income spectrum. And while the rich certainly have significant means to drive aggregate spending, they cannot do it alone. Again from the Bloomberg article: Although U.S. consumer spending climbed to its highest level in four years in August, according to Gallup surveys, it still lags 2008 levels by more than 20 percent. Most of the spending came from higher-income households.The erosion of the middle class in America continues to be one of our greatest challenges. While a lack of middle-class income growth can create headwinds for any economy in the short term, the longer-term risks of political instability and civil unrest can become much greater. The unfortunate reality is that the federal government has made promises to too many people that far exceed its ability to meet make good on these promises. Bringing the country's fiscal house in order, and thereby returning the American dream to the middle class, will undoubtedly require some combination of spending cuts and tax increases for those most able to afford them. We have no doubt that we can meet these challenges, but it will require some pain and sacrifice by all."
