""I think it's really nice that we can do this together.""

For dinner, the Driskill Grill creates a quiet space behind the busy, noisy Driskill Bar, one of the city's most popular gathering spots.The Grill has the look of an early 20th century gentlemen's club, with dark wood, oil paintings and sconces on the walls. In that elegant setting, the very modern menu draws inspiration from the dynamic world of contemporary farm-to-table dining with a Southwestern touch.A tasting is a good way to experience the extensive menu. Executive chef Jonathan Gelman's plates arrive at the table with a painterly touch.Deep red brush strokes of caramelized beet juice decorate an appetizer plate with tastings of beef tartare, ahi poke, and a Prince Edward Island oyster on the half shell.On the dessert plate, delicately painted tendrils and flowers extend from the Chocolate-Raspberry Gateau with fresh raspberries as if the dessert were resting on a Pre-Raphaelite painting. The Chocolate Carmel Crunch Bar is topped not only with a shiny, candied hazelnut but a delicate square of gold leaf.Using heat to frame his flavors, scallops and seared hamachi are rolled in chili dust. Chef Gelman ups the volume on his half-shell oysters by using spicy local chives in a modified mignonette, making the briny Prince Edward Sound oysters sparkle and shine.The familiar ahi tuna burger is playfully transformed into a slider, the tender, perfectly cooked patty topped with slices of fresh strawberry.In the entree part of the tasting, a richly flavored Madera sauce compliments tender lamb chops. To contrast the textures and flavors, the lamb chops are coated with toasted breadcrumbs. The overall effect is deeply satisfying, light and refreshing.THE DRISKILL GRILL: 604 Brazos Street, Austin, Texas 78701 | (512) 391-7162Franklin Barbecue, one of the most popular barbecue joints in Austin, until recently, sold all of its food from a trailer. Kyra Coots, a fan, reminisced about those days. ""The old place had uncovered benches and in the winter when it rained you got wet. People didn't care. They'd wait two hours miserable, but when they were eating their barbecue, they knew it was worth it.""Franklin Barbecue came in from the cold when it moved into 900 East 11th, a small space on the east side of I-35, near an entrance to the University of Texas. Now the old trailer sits forlornly in the back next to the smoke trailer.""At Franklin,"" Coots added, ""You're definitely here for the meat. It's not a sides place.""The brisket, pork rib, and pulled pork are hand cut, seasoned and smoked by handyman, co-owner, and chef, Aaron Franklin. Only the sausage is made by an outside provider, the Texas Sausage Company.Stacy Franklin, Aaron's wife and co-owner, explains the genesis of the business, ""Aaron was really into barbecue, fooling around with it for years. But he didn't really get it until we opened.""This is seat-of-the-pants, learn-as-you-go cooking.Aaron keeps it simple with a dry rub of kosher salt and coarse black pepper that goes on before the meats are smoked from 9:00 am until 7:00 am the next day. What comes out of the smoker in the morning is what's served in the restaurant that day.The handwritten sign in the window explains how it works, ""Hours: 7 days a week, 11:00am-till the meat runs out!"" Which means, people in the know start lining up an hour before opening time.Ordering at Franklin retains part of the trailer experience, albeit inside a nicely appointed interior. Standing in line, customers inch their way to a glass barrier behind which Aaron wields a sharp knife, carving-to-order whatever meat you want and laying the hot, fragrant barbecue onto a square of waxed paper.The meat is weighed and handed to the cashier where you pay your bill. Adding two slices of white bread, any of the housemade sides and sauces -- if you want any -- and you're on your way to one of the dozen Formica tables inside or the handful of wooden picnic tables and benches outside on the covered patio.Locals recommend passing up the lean for the fatty brisket. A thick slab shows why the brisket is so popular. Juicy, tender and flaky, the brisket has a lot of good, meat flavor with salty-peppery heat. The pork ribs are good too, but when Aaron asks you what you want, ask for the fat, middle ribs. The small ribs on the end can be dried out.The pulled pork is moist and tender and benefits from a good dousing of the Port Vinegar sauce.FRANKLIN BARBECUE: 900 E. 11th, Austin, TX 78702At La Condesa, elegance comes with a basket of crisp taco chips and guacamole topped with green apples and fresh crab.In a setting that could be mistaken for an art gallery, light fixtures descend like apparitions from the high ceiling.With a bar and patio on the upper level and an expansive dining room and deck on the street level, the restaurant is airy and spacious. La Condesa fills up quickly when the kitchen opens for dinner at 5:00pm so reservations are essential.Cocktails and appetizers are a great way to go.Ceviche gets a light touch. On the night we visited, we had the Pacific amberjack. Slices of the delicate white fish were surrounded by an orange-lime sauce, the heat supplied by chipotle peppers and ginger. Delicious.Executive chef Rene Ortiz creates complex sauces using citrus and peppers that bring out the best in familiar Mexican dishes.At dinner, taquitos come with half a dozen fillings, including rotisserie chicken, shrimp, cheese and chorizo, beef, pork, vegetarian and, the very popular, Tecateño with Tecate flavored, battered fried white fish.The Tecate batter is tempera-light and crunchy. The accompanying slaw is made with charred corn, chipotle peppers, tomatillos, and salsa arbol. Perfect as an appetizer to enjoy with beer, wine and cocktails.Speaking of cocktails, the specialty cocktails are exotic. The Alma Blanca is a good example of an unusual mix of ingredients: ""habanero-infused siembra azul blanco, domaine de canton ginger liqueur, agave nectar, pineapple juice, fresh corn, hoja de hierba santa, hibiscus-rose infused salt rim."" A mouthful of improbable ingredients (corn?), but the mouth-wateringly delicious cocktail is layered with sweet-heat.LA CONDESA: 400A West 2nd Street Austin, TX 78701 | (512) 499-0300- By David Lattwww.oneforthetable.com"

It's for a piece of the Valastro clan's sense of connectedness and rapport. I feel like I'm there, in the bakery or in one of their home kitchens, their warmth around me, cajoling me to have one more helping.",2013-03-11,"This undated photo provided by DKC Public Relations shows ""Cake Boss"" star Buddy Valastro. Valastro says he's long wanted to give fans of his popular TLC reality show an opportunity to taste the cakes viewers watch him bake and decorate at his Hoboken, N.J., bakery. So Valastro gave his recipes to a company that supplies his bakery with goods like sugar and flour to come up with a cake line for bakeries and grocery stores across America. That line rolls out this summer. (AP Photo/DKC Public Relations)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce93b26000036007faa9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My kids and I watch ""The Cake Boss"" every weekend, playing episode after episode on Netflix as if taking just one more cookie from the Italian cookie platter at a party.There's the butter cookie sandwich with raspberry jam, half-dipped in dark chocolate glaze and then in colored sprinkles. The pretzel-shaped chocolate sandwich cookie. The cloud-fluffy pignole-studded cookie. The green and red leaf-shaped chocolate sandwich cookies, the three-tiered Italian wedding cookies. They are the special treat cookies of my childhood, and I doubt I'd have any more restraint than I did as a kid if they were nearby.My kids love watching the show because they get to see giant, amazing, novelty cakes conceptualized and assembled. When my 8-year-old son watches Mauro or Buddy ""dirty ice"" a cake, or slather on chocolate mousse filling between slabs of pound cake, his face takes on an expression of happy, covetous wonder.My 11-year-old daughter enjoys it for the delicious-looking epic cakes as well, but I can tell that she's also digging the design and architecture aspects of the cake-creating. And then the cast of characters is pretty rich.I have my own reasons. The industrial elements of the bakery don't really grab me. I much prefer the idea of a sweet little one- or two-person operation, a kind of Holly Hobbie kindly grandma butter cream bakery, instead of watching the fellas sling 20-pound tubs of factory fondant around. (In my foodie memoir Licking the Spoon: A Memoir of Food, Family, and Identity, there's a chapter called ""The Cake Bible,"" an homage to Rose Levy Beranbaum, about my fraught foray into wedding cake baking.)When I watch ""The Cake Boss,"" I'm much more hungry for the doses of big Italian family. I didn't have one, growing up, but I was surrounded by them -- on the block, at the store, in the restaurant, at school concerts, at church. They were boisterous and interconnected and quick to raise their voices in joy or in displeasure.The biggest hunger I feel when I watch ""The Cake Boss"" is not for a piece of cake. It's for a piece of the Valastro clan's sense of connectedness and rapport. I feel like I'm there, in the bakery or in one of their home kitchens, their warmth around me, hugging, laughing, teasing, cajoling me to have one more helping. It's not like I want to be one of Buddy's sisters -- I don't. When they get going, their voices sound like cats in an alley. In his family, there's a lot of little bits of dysfunction, everyone playing their roles the way they always have-and always will? Nothing wrong with that, necessarily, but it doesn't give the individuals a lot of room to change, grow, get beyond the familial Hydra formation.I come from a very diffuse family, and that's a blessing, because along with the dysfunction, there's a lot of latitude to take plenty of protective distance. My sister and I are very close, and for that I am grateful. As my kids snuggle on either side of me and laugh, or hold our breaths in unison as Buddy and Mauro lift a big, elaborate cake and have to load it into the truck, we are connected, just as we are every day in dozens of ways.We aren't an Italian family living in New Jersey. I'm not having any more kids, so we won't be replicating the gang of siblings with their spouses, kids and in-laws at any point. If I had to go to weekly Sunday family dinners with tables laden with lasagna, ziti, the works (on top of mega access to bakery cookies), it would trash my figure. And... I'm guessing the Valastros probably wouldn't take a gay sister in stride. If I were a Valastro, I'd have to do a lot more debating, explaining and resisting. As reality TV shows go, this one is transfixing because of how far it is from our own reality. But the closeness of our own little family pod is the main course that sustains us. The show's dose of the mercurial, lovable Buddy and his family is perfectly titrated. It completes me, without cramping my style."

Without it, you can have more talent and tenacity than anyone but it won't matter. It takes courage to connect with people, to tell them your dreams and show them your skills. It takes courage to keep going, to suffer all the inevitable setbacks, rejections and disappointments and not give up. Talent, self-belief and tenacity matter not a jot without it. Courage underpins everything.I used to think that successful people aren't scared. I believed they achieved greatness because they were far braver than I. I imagined they had special reserves of fire that I would never have. For I couldn't imagine speaking to audiences without passing out, or giving interviews without garbling my words. And I knew that being a successful author would certainly involve such things. So I watched them enviously, wondering how they were so blessed with courage and why wasn't I? Then I met a few and found out I was wrong. These people weren't without fear, they simply didn't let it stop them, which, of course, is very the definition of courage: to be scared and not let it stop you.
