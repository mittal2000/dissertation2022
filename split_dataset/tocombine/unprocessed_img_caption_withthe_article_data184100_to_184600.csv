""There were people who were genuinely upset that what they thought was perfect was no longer,"" Seal said of his seven-year marriage to Klum. ""I'm in an excellent place right now.

First manufactured in 1906, the 40/50hp Silver Ghost model is known as ""The Corgi,"" named after a line of toys modelled after the car, according to the Daily Mail. The opulent Double Pullman limousine was first purchased in 1912 by John M. Stephens for about 1,200 euros according to Bonhams. While the luxury car was intended for personal use, many of the models were converted into ambulances during World War One, the Telegraph reported.The car, which is capable of running at 60 miles per hour gets 15 miles to the gallon. Its headlights, carriage lights, rear lights and inflatable tires are still intact.The car was sold following the death of its American owner John O'Quinn. A Bonhams representative described the auction as ""pure theater"" as two revelers bid in over 125,000 euro increments before the hammer dropped at 5.8 million euros, well above the 2.5 million euro expected sale price, according to the Telegraph. This won't be the last big-ticket item up for bid at Bonhams. The auction house will auction off a classic Mercedes Benz in September, which is expected to fetch over $2 million.Check out some photos of the Rolls Royce:"

And when I was finally allowed to play with cousins, I was shielded by sunblock, thin layers and my father's cowboy hat. So you can imagine how shock I was to recently hear Mom say, ""Dana, I think I got a sunburn."" I immediately went into parent-mode and began to scold her about skipping out on sun protection, even (and especially) as a black woman. While the damage had already been done, she and others can certainly appreciate this post-sun solution. In the video above, BellaSugar reporter Kirbie Johnson takes us through six simple steps to mask a facial sunburn. Starting with a clean face, rub with ice to reduce redness and swelling. Then go the natural route with aloe vera, as its anti-inflammatory properties helps expedite the healing process. Still red in the face and got a party to attend? Apply a green-tinted primer and yellow-based foundation, as these shades neutralize the hot hue. And you should also avoid blush as it will only magnify the problem. Have you ever been sunburned?
