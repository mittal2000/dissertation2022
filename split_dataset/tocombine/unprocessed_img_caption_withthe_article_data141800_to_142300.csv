The reality TV star was spotted dining with none other than Andre Leon Talley today, hanging out at L'Avenue in Paris. Kim and Andre, Vogue's contributing editor, are both in town for Paris Fashion Week -- in fact, Kim sat pretty in the Givenchy front row just yesterday. But we never anticipated these two to actually cross paths, much less dine together like pals. As Vogue's outspoken representative and Anna Wintour's right-hand man, Andre has not cozied up to the likes of Kim Kardashian. In fact, after the Met Gala 2012, he told an audience, ""I don't think any celebrity can take away from fashion. Not even Kim Kardashian could take away from fashion..."" But it looks like slowly but surely, Kim has won over even the toughest critics at Vogue. After her conspicuous absence at the 2012 Met Gala, she earned herself an invite in 2013. Now she's dining with Andre Leon Talley during Paris Fashion Week. What's next, a front row seat next to Anna and a Vogue cover?At this rate, nothing could surprise us.

Plus, these essentials won't take up much space and can be purchased at a low cost.",2013-09-30,"Plasterboard tools set with metal studs, screws, tape measure, rasp, screwgun and punch lock crimper",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d8f262400005100951ff1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a renter, it's important to equip yourself with tools to maintain a home. While you may not take on major home improvements, a basic toolkit goes a long way to help you accomplish minor repairs or small projects around your home. Basic tools come in handy for the entire lifecycle of your rental, from the day you move in and set up your new space, to the moment your last box is packed and ready for move out. Plus, these essentials won't take up much space and can be purchased at a low cost.Tape MeasureThis small, low cost tool is critical in setting up your home upon move in. Use it to measure spaces in your home, make sure your furniture fits through doorways and hallways, plan the layout of your space and hang art. A 25-foot tape measure will suit most rentals and is available at local hardware and convenience stores.Extensions Cords & Power StripsThe number of power outlets in a home is usually not the deciding factor when it comes to signing a lease and is not something that's easily altered. Fortunately, power strips and extension cords offer renters an easy fix and come at a low cost so you don't have to worry about accommodating extra lamps or electronics.Lightweight HammerThere's no need to keep a professional grade hammer around when a small lightweight hammer will suffice for any minor home improvements or interior design projects, like building furniture and hanging photos.Assorted Nails, Hooks & ScrewsMinor home repair projects can arise unexpectedly, so it's a good idea to keep an assortment of nails, screws, hooks and other accessories in your home. Most hardware stores sell these assorted items in compact packages so you won't have to worry about keeping them organized.All-in-One ScrewdriverThis handy device saves you from buying multiple screwdrivers and can assist with various projects around your home whenever they should arise.FlashlightWhile your phone might make for a good flashlight replacement when navigating your home at night, in the case of real emergency a proper flashlight is a must. It's a good idea to keep multiple flashlights in your home for easy access at all times if you're ever caught off guard. Even in non emergency situations, a flashlight provides a more powerful and reliable source of light and well worth investing in. You can find flashlights at low price points in battery-powered, manually-powered or solar-powered varieties.Level AppYour phone may not be the most powerful or reliable flashlight, but it does make for an effective alternative to a physical level. You can download a free level application in the App Store or Google Play for an easy way to measure wall hangings without taking up additional space in your home.Krazy GlueThe ultimate tool for renters, this magic compound can hold pretty much anything together, including frames, table legs, carpet, even dishes!Patching SpackleThis lightweight putty is perfect for quick repairs to walls. You can find patching repair kits for less than $10 and since you use only a small amount for each repair, one kit will last throughout the lifecycle of your rental."

But the famous sis clearly has weddings on the mind. In her latest column for the Telegraph, on the subject of flower markets, Pippa teases, ""Maybe I'll be a DIY bride?""Dropping the ""b"" word is a bold move for Pippa, who has been dating her boyfriend, Nico Jackson, for around eight months. Things between Middleton and Jackson, a 35-year-old stockbroker, appear to be more serious compared to Pippa's previous dalliances, and chatter amid the British tabloids is that a Pippa wedding is coming sooner rather than later. And when it does, it appears Pippa might be doing the flowers herself. The 30-year-old party planner writes in the Telegraph that she loves perusing the outdoor flower market for gorgeous blooms, interacting with ""the always friendly and generally flirtatious traders."" (Of course.) Self-deprecatingly, she also lists her flower woes: ""Why do my orchids keep dying and how can I prolong the life of the (sadly, infrequent) bouquets that land on my doorstep?""Sounds like Nico better up his flower game.
