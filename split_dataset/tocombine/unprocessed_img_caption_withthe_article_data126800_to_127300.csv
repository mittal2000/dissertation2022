Matt Mead participates in a special session on jobs in America during the National Governor's Association Winter Meeting in Washington, Sunday, Feb. 23, 2014. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb151aa2200005700db44ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wyoming took an unprecedented step this week when the governor approved a budget that would prevent the state from reviewing or funding a new set of science standards that treat climate change as fact. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are a new set of education initiatives that have been adopted in 10 states and, like the Common Core State Standards, are designed to make sure students across the country are being held to the same benchmarks. They were developed with input from 26 states; Wyoming does not number among them.Although the adoption of the NGSS has been controversial in other parts of the country, Wyoming is the first and only state to take legislative action to prevent the its Board of Education from reviewing the Science Standards, according to a press release from education advocacy group Climate Parents. Rep. Matt Teeters (R-Lingle) first proposed a budget amendment that stops the state from considering the NGSS, according to Wyoming outlet the Casper Star-Tribune. Gov. Matt Mead (R) approved this amendment in his budget Wednesday. In Kansas and Kentucky, both of which would eventually adopt the NGSS, the measure previously drew opposition from right-wing groups that opposed its teachings of climate change and evolution as fact. “Outsiders are telling public school families that we must follow the rich man’s elitist religion of evolution, that we no longer have what the Kentucky Constitution says is the right to worship almighty God,” Baptist minister and NGSS opponent Matt Singleton said at a Kentucky hearing in July. “Instead, this fascist method teaches that our children are the property of the state.”Last year, a committee of Wyoming educators recommended that the state adopt the Science Standards, according to the Casper Star-Tribune.But Gov. Mead has in the past expressed his doubts about climate change, and these beliefs may have contributed to his decision to approve the anti-NGSS amendment. According to ThinkProgress, Mead has previously said he is ""unconvinced climate change is man-made.”Groups that promote education on climate change condemned the approval of the anti-NGSS amendment. “The main reason they’re opposing NGSS is because of climate change. It’s the only issue they raised,” Lisa Hoyos, president of Climate Parents told The Huffington Post over the phone. “These are like bread-and-butter science standards. It's about engineering, it's about geology, core content our kids need to be getting.”In November 2013, when the Wyoming Board of Education started hearings to consider the NGSS, parents complained about the measure's treatment of evolution and climate change.The standards “seek to infuse students with a particular political view regarding climate change, sustainability, renewable energy and other environmental matters,” said Judy H., according to the organization COPE Inc., which says it promotes objectivity in education. She also said the board should “not adopt this Plan which appears to promote an atheistic worldview rather than objective science education.”"

Now it appears she let us in on who that may be: Avicii.The 55-year-old singer posted an Instagram photo on Friday that said she's hitting the studio with the Swedish DJ/producer, whose hit ""Wake Me Up"" recently peaked at No. 4 on the Hot 100. Of course, it's possible they're working on a different project -- perhaps something for Avicii -- but the producer seems like a fitting choice for a Material Girl collaboration, given that she made a surprise appearance during his set at the 2012 Ultra Music Festival.Madonna captioned the photo: ""Doing some house work after 4 hours of sleep which is why i cant spell! On my way to the studio to work with Avicii! #clean""Avicii previously remixed ""Girl Gone Wild"" from Madonna's 2012 album ""MDNA."" Working with him means Madonna's next outing is likely to continue the electronic and dance-heavy stylings she employed on her most recent projects. There's no release date scheduled for what will be her 13th studio album. Madonna needs another ""Ray of Light"" moment to convince the naysays who claim ""MDNA"" was a failure. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard chart, earning lukewarm reviews, but then fell precipitously and neglected to produce a second Top 10 hit following ""Give Me All Your Luvin.'""Watch Madonna tease her guest collaborator in the Canadian Press video below."

Because Natasha Richardson wanted to get married.Neeson told the U.K.'s Hull Daily Mail that the late actress, to whom he was married for 15 years before her untimely death in 2009, told him he could either take the role as Bond or they could get hitched. It must have been true love, because Neeson chose the latter. “It was about 18 or 19 years ago and my wife-to-be said, ‘If you play James Bond we’re not getting married!’ And I had to take that on board, because I did want to marry her,"" he said.That time frame would have put him in consideration for 1995's ""GoldenEye,"" the first of four Bond installments that instead starred Pierce Brosnan. Neeson didn't explain exactly why Richardson wasn't okay with them getting married and Neeson playing Bond (men can lean in, too, you know?), but at least it didn't require him to be away from his family for the multiple arcs that Bond actors often devote to the franchise. And we know it didn't harm his career -- he'd just come off an Oscar nomination for ""Schindler's List,"" and he's since become a box office star with roles in ""Star Wars,"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and the sleeper hit ""Taken.""Other actors considered for Bond have included Josh Brolin, Mel Gibson, Sam Neill and Sean Bean.[via Hull Daily Mail]"

Unfortunately, that is just not enough space to contain the rivalry between Duke and North Carolina. The longstanding college hoops feud goes back decades and passionate the fans on either side have managed to score a few points of their own over the years. Not content just cheering loudly and proudly at Cameron Indoor and the Dean Dome, fans have taken to exchanging pranks up and down Tobacco Road. As these collegiate capers show, nothing is too sacred when it comes to this rivalry, whether it's Michael Jordan's jersey or hymnals in a chapel. Here are five memorable stunts pulled off by fans on either side of one of the most heated hardwood rivalries in the country. The UNC fight song won't likely be heard in the Duke University Chapel any time soon but the lyrics were surreptitiously placed there during the 2013 season.  The head of Duke's mascot was placed on a pole above a UNC campus store. A reminder that the rivals were meeting again in 2013 and also that ""Game Of Thrones"" was quite popular.  With the 2014 season in full swing, Blue Devils spray painted ""DUKE"" across the pillars of a building at the University of North Carolina.  Days before No. 1 Duke and No. 2 UNC faced off on Feb. 6, 1998, a couple of daredevil Duke fans snuck into the Dean Dome and managed to steal Michael Jordan's retired jersey from the rafters.The Tobacco Road rivalry has produced plenty of professional basketball players but also a few who could have been professional pranksters."

(Photo by Doug Pensinger/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dcde926000035008003f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Welcome to our ""Like An Olympian"" series. During the 2014 Sochi Olympics, HuffPost Healthy Living will take a look at lifestyle and fitness lessons from competitors, coaches and former Olympians alike. We recently had the opportunity to speak with Paralympic adaptive snowboarder Amy Purdy, who has partnered with Proctor and Gamble's Thank You, Mom campaign leading up to her first Games -- and the first to include para-snowboarding.On falling in love with snowboarding: I started when I was 15. I skied before that, so in a way I guess I had a love for the snow and being in nature, but I didn't ever love skiing that much. Once I started snowboarding I really fell in love with it. All of my closest friends snowboarded. There was something so freeing about going out with your friends, being in nature, having fun but also challenging yourself. It's a very individual sport. It's different than going out and playing basketball. We snowboard with our friends but also have personal goals, and I found an independence and confidence in that. I knew it would be a part of my life forever.At the age of 19, Purdy contracted bacterial meningitis, resulting in the loss of her spleen, her kidneys, hearing in her left ear and both of her legs below the knee. In the hospital, she was told she had less than a 2 percent chance of living.On getting back on the board: When I lost my legs, [I didn't say] ""Am I going to snowboard again?"" My question was, ""How am I going to snowboard again?"" I was so passionate about it that I believed if I could find the right legs, meet other people who had done it, there would be a way to do it again. Even up until this point of going to the Paralympics, I'm still constantly tweaking my legs and gear to get them to be where I need them to be. Right now, there aren't any feet that are made for snowboarding. There are a lot of feet made for walking, so we're essentially customizing off-the-shelf prosthetic components to try to get them to move the way we need them to for snowboarding.That's why I say snowboarding saved my life. It kept me looking forward, versus even having time to look back and say, ""Why did this happen?""On training: Now, I'm on snow. But from June through December, I was primarily dry-land training, which consisted of a lot of road cycling for endurance and quad muscles. I have a personal trainer who is also a CrossFit coach. We train one-on-one with a mix of CrossFit and strength training. I love the row machine. I do pull-ups, ring pull-ups, pushups, planks. Now that I'm in competition season, I'm maintaining with bodyweight workouts like pushups, planks and balance ball stuff.Being a double leg amputee I burn up to 60 percent more calories than the average person. [Editor's note: The Amputee Coalition estimates that it is ""40 to 100 percent more metabolically demanding to walk with transtibial (below-knee) amputation(s)"".] We're using different muscles and compensating. I have to eat a lot, and to be honest, it's really difficult. I eat and eat and eat: as many snacks as I possibly can, I drink protein shakes. I have a big breakfast and a big dinner at night -- or two! I love vegetables, and I kind of naturally gravitate toward healthier foods, but at this point in the game, it's just about keeping calories on.On race-day breakfast: I try not to change it up too much on race day. I'm a big oatmeal fan. For my every-morning breakfast, I will do oatmeal with cinnamon, goat's milk or even butter, with apples and raisins, and then I'll maybe do some eggs, say two poached eggs with that.On overcoming obstacles: We all have challenges. You can let them be obstacles or roadblocks or you can use them. We've all seen that every challenge we've gone through, we've learned something from. It's not getting hung up on the challenges but figuring out how to get ahead. I wouldn't be where I am if I didn't take my situation and run with it. I have two prosthetic legs, this is my life, what am I going to do with it? And it's put me on this amazing journey. I can look back and be completely grateful and say I would never want to change anything. My hopes would be that other people recognize that we all have challenges. From the outside looking in it might look easy, but people relate to vulnerability and to seeing someone who has had challenges and has overcome.On looking ahead to Sochi: I really am taking it one day at a time. It's more [about] dealing with what's right in front of you and trying to be in the moment. Sochi's the big picture, but right now we're doing the little details to make sure the big picture goes as we hoped.Check out Purdy's ""Thank You, Mom"" video below:As told to Sarah Klein. This interview has been edited and condensed."

Most people start planning their run training soon after the new year, but given the absurdly-cold temperatures, incessant snow, and painful wind chill, it's been nearly impossible to keep momentum. Instead of stressing about your lack of running, why not take advantage of some of the industry's coolest indoor cardio workouts that will promise to release those endorphins?Indoor Cycling -- Gyms and boutique studios have been working hard to diversify the popular ""sitting on a bike."" A 45-minute spin class could burn on average of 350 calories but as much as 500-600 calories depending on how hard you work. Bonus: Many of these spin classes are have moved away from a traditional endurance ride by including an arm strength component. Studios such as Swerve in NYC have even added a competitive element by introducing teams.  Photography by Lisa RussmanRowing -- A 45- to 50-minute rowing class can burn upwards of 700 calories, which is twice as much as spinning. Since rowing requires proper form, every stroke requires you to work your entire body -- pretty much every single muscle group. Gyms such as Equinox have introduced group fitness classes involving the row machine and boutique studios such as City Row and Throwback Fitness in NYC, RowZone in Philadelphia, and RowFit Chicago are growing in popularity. Jump Rope -- Jump Roping for as little as 10 minutes has the potential to burn about 100+ calories. The jump rope is an easy ""no excuses"" home or travel workout option, happens to cost less than $10 and is super fun when you add different tricks. If you want a little more than just a basic jump rope, check out Cross Rope. It is a cool interchangeable weighted jump rope system that is appropriate for all levels. Aquatic -- Training for a triathlon? At least the swim part can be done indoors! Swimming laps for approximately 30 minutes burns between 250-350 calories (depends on the intensity), provides a total body workout, and is easy on the joints. Pools are available at most YMCAs and recreation centers.   In reality, cardio can be achieved by using the simplest of equipment such as an elliptical, stepper or a stationary bike. However, these options add a lot more FUN to the traditional workout routine."

They do grow up fast though, and before you know it, they are turning 6 (give or take a few years), and suddenly they need to express themselves and show their independent style. As a mom of three girls I saw this emerging, especially with my middle one, at the very lovable age of 3. We see it in how they act and how the dress, even how they wear their hair. They want to be cool and on trend and they love having opportunities to express themselves and their feelings. They must be unique and different. This goes for their clothes, their accessories, their devices -- just about everything. A group of girls will all have the same ""coolest"" backpack or smartphone, but each one will be unique in how they accessorize. They like to stand out... just as long as they look like their friends!All kidding aside, helping these kids accessorize will be a big trend this year, as was evidenced at American International Toy Fair. I saw many toys and kits in so many categories that will allow kids to be creative and express themselves. Kids will customize their ponies and dollhouses, their cars and their board games. They will create things to wear and to share, and most of this will be done without technology (though not entirely -- there are a few cool tech items that dial up the creativity as well.)Hasbro has a full lineup of products that give kids the opportunity to customize, including their board games. This fall, kids will be able to personalize their own Monopoly game in minutes. By adding photos of themselves, their friends and family, and their favorite things to the property spaces, game tokens, and chance and community chest cards, they can truly make this ""their"" game.A favorite of mine is Hasbro's DOHVINCI, which is a new kind of modeling compound that includes a Styler tool with which kids create their own 3D designs on almost anything. Kits will be available so kids can make frames or keepsake boxes, but they can also use the Doh on items you find around the house. Mattel will offer a way for kids to customize their own Hot Wheels. Taking new cars -- or ones they already own -- they will be able to spray paint and design their cars with this whole new set, which will be available this fall. And while it may sound messy, it's not, and Hot Wheels fans will go wild.   For the fashionistas, Bandai introduces Locksies -- a new way to create beautiful fashions for dolls. Kids will design clothes and fashions using material and an innovative system of attaching the material to dolls, their pets, and even doll houses.  Crayola will give kids a way to create their own fashion looks and customize cars by first sketching it, and then using an app to bring it to life. With My Virtual Design Pro, fashion models will sport the outfits kids create and show them off on the runway, while cars will be ready to race once the design process is done.  A balanced toy box leaves plenty of room for creativity, and this year kids -- and parents -- will have plenty of choices. These new products will keep kids busy, open up the creative thinking process, and help them discover more about who they are and what they like. And while there are both messy and mess-free options, all will give kids the ability to show off their masterpieces when they are done."
