Most of what she told me is long forgotten. But then she offered to answer my most pressing question. ""Will I ever have children?"" I asked, because my husband and I had been trying for years and I was sad and frustrated and really believed that it would never happen.The Tarot expert turned over a couple of cards and remarked, ""I see two boys sitting on your lap.""Four years later, my two sons, born twenty months apart, were sitting on my lap. Sure, it's entirely coincidental, because who really believes in such things? But still... There's something about New Hope, and about the mojo of Central Bucks County in general, that lends itself to magical, powerful, creative thinking. George Washington felt it. Henry Mercer felt it. James Michener felt it.Come for a few days, and you may just feel it, too.Six Great Attractions in Central Bucks CountyHenry Mercer, born in Doylestown in 1856, was an artist, archeologist, writer and lawyer. He loved medieval castles, extensive cave systems, Irish fiddle music, and the arts and crafts movement and apparently hated the way fires consumed homes and buildings of the time. So, before the advent of cement mixers, Mercer combined all of his loves and fears and built three free-form concrete structures you can still see today.Fonthill. As Mercer's primary residence, he adorned the stark grey walls with ""Storytelling"" Moravian Tiles: colorful 3-D relief, sculptural clay creations that depict biblical tales, discovery of the New World and motifs of nature and ordinary life set right into the concrete. A man of the world, he collected tiles from all ages and foreign lands, including Deft from the Netherlands, Damascus tiles in Arabic installed upside-down, Chinese roof tiles, Persian tiles and four Babylonian cuneiforms - Temple receipts for sheep and goats- from 2100 BCE that Mercer purchased for $79. Take the one-hour trek on labyrinthine pathways through the home to see Hobbit-like guest rooms, Mercer's art-studio/sun flooded library, and some of the 32 curving staircases. Moravian Tile Works. Tour Fonthill then see how those great Arts and Crafts tiles were made by hand. Afterwards, buy a few - or more if you plan to decorate your home a la Mercer. Mercer Museum. Opened in 1916, this was the third concrete structure built by Henry Mercer strictly to house his collection of 40,000 pre-industrial artifacts. Thousands of tools, representing sixty crafts and trades, either hang from six floors of walkways or are crammed into display cases: boats, plows, stove plates, antique buckets, wagons, musical instruments, and a 9-ft high hangman's gallows on the 7th floor, used to execute a murderer in 1914. James Michener Art Museum. The man who wrote Hawaii, The Source, Alaska and others had roots in Bucks County, though dirt poor ones and despite that, collected art even as a child. When the Bucks County Prison closed in 1984, and a movement was afoot to repurpose it as a world-class art museum, Michener was pressed to lend his name as fundraising draw. Now considered ""The Art & Soul of Bucks County,"" the Michener Museum features the largest collection of Pennsylvania impressionists, thanks to a donation of 68 paintings from Gerry and Margaurite Lenfest in 1999. In addition to paintings, the Michener showcases some of the most unusual modern and Japanese furniture in open, floodlit galleries. One exhibit is devoted to the ""Father of American Craft"" movement, American-Japanese furniture designer, George Nakashima whose beautiful organic grained wood pieces are absolutely captivating. Washington Crossing Historic Park. ""These are the times that try men's souls,"" wrote Thomas Paine, about the defeats and scarcities that George Washington and his Continental Army had experienced by the winter of 1776. Over 11,000 men had dwindled to 4,000 by the time Washington and his troops retreated to the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River. But something spurred them on to action, and on Christmas Day 1776, Washington and 2,400 soldiers crossed the river, marched to Trenton, NJ and won the first of many victories. Remember that famous rendering of Washington Crossing the Delaware? Painted in 1840, it was never meant to be an actual snapshot of what happened on that fateful Christmas Day in 1776, but a symbol. Washington would not have been brandishing an American flag, which was commissioned six months later by the Continental Congress. Take the one-hour tour that begins in the newly expanded Visitor's Center then heads outside along the riverbank to learn about this and other particulars of that fateful night. Peddler's Village, Lahaska In 1962, local farmer Earl Jamison, inspired by Disneyland and Carmel in California, converted a set of chicken coops into the Cock and Bull Pub and since then, his Village has spread to 42 acres, with 70 shops and restaurants and one inn, the Golden Plough (now undergoing renovations). Earl did much of the landscaping and brickwork and though he passed away in 2002, Peddler's Village is still family owned and operated. Annual Festivals like Apple in November, Strawberry in May bring in locals and guests by the thousands.

5,FOOD & DRINK,Whole Foods Is About To Start Brewing Its Own Beer,Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whole-foods-beer_us_5b9df113e4b03a1dcc8f2cee,"A first for the company and, perhaps, for the American supermarket industry.",2014-03-27,"In this photo taken Sunday, Feb. 6, 2011, customers gather outside of a Little Rock, Ark., Whole Foods store. Whole Foods Market Inc. releases quarterly financial earnings Wednesday, Feb. 9, after the market close.(AP Photo/Danny Johnston)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df1133c000066000a57a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"North America's 360-some Whole Foods Markets already sell beer made by more than 500 different breweries. But one location set to open on Houston's Post Oak Boulevard this summer plans to pour beer under a label never before sold at Whole Foods, or anywhere else: its own. Last week, the Austin-based supermarket chain started soliciting applications for a brewmaster to head a brewery at the new location -- a first for the company and, perhaps, for the American supermarket industry. Though several other grocery chains sell their own beer, they usually subcontract the actual brewing of the liquid to outside companies.In a phone call with The Huffington Post, Nichole Becerra, who oversees the beer programs for all the Whole Foods in the Southwest, described the brewery as an outgrowth of Whole Foods' experimentation with building bars at locations around the country. ""As we developed our beer program and made it better, putting beer bars in our stores and offering growlers in our stores, it just seemed like a natural evolution for us,"" she said. For now, details on the brewery remain fuzzy. Becerra's team is currently inviting employees around the region to send in suggestions for the label's name; she says the name will ultimately be ""something really fun"" rather than the ""365"" brand that Whole Foods currently uses for most in-house products. Becerra said that she wants to hire someone with experience brewing beer on a fairly large scale, rather than a home-brew hobbyist. But she said that they have not yet decided on the store's exact brewing capacity, nor on how much of the beer, if any, they will distribute outside the Post Oak location. The beer's style is also up in the air. ""What we brew will depend on who we hire,"" Becerra said. ""The regional team isn't going to dictate what they make. We really want to make it up to the expert and up to someone who might offer us a really great recipe.""Kate Neu, a marketing coordinator at Whole Foods Corporate, said that while Whole Foods currently has no plans to open further breweries, there's precedent for a local experiment like this one to expand across the country if it's successful. ""That's what started to happen with in-store bars,"" Neu said. ""In a few regions, the stores started playing with it, and it became a widespread practice that's working really well. So that's definitely a hope the same thing could happen with breweries.""Whole Foods' move into brewing comes at a heady time for the American craft beer industry, with sales growing rapidly for over a decade. American spending on craft beer grew 20 percent in 2013 alone.But sales of private-label beer at the few other supermarket chains that sell it have not fared as well, dropping 13 percent in 2013. And Julia Herz, craft beer director at the Beer Association, an industry trade group, attributed this disparity to consumers' desire for authenticity in branding.""Some beer lovers might want more than just a well-priced beer style,"" she said. ""They want the whole story behind the brewery who actually makes those brands, because ultimately beer is about brands.""Still, Beccera is confident that Whole Foods' focus on a premium product and in-store brewing will differentiate its beer from the beverages its competitors have been having trouble selling.""I think it's going to be way better than any kind of private label in-house beer that you're going to find on the shelf,"" she said.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

Every day TMZ and similar entertainment news outlets report on the latest failed Hollywood relationship. Given the pressures associated with being in the spotlight, being an old, married Hollywood couple is a coveted status for those entertainers fortunate enough to stay together through films, television shows, albums and undesired paparazzi attention. Hollywood power couple Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's recent announcement of their split has sent shock waves across the digital world. More shocking than the dissolution of their 11-year marriage, however, is the terminology Paltrow used to describe the breakup. According to Paltrow's announcement, she and Martin are going the process of consciously uncoupling. While many individuals are mocking Gwyneth Paltrow's sophisticated terminology to describe her separation and calling for the introduction of a new Facebook relationship status, her characterization of the dissolution of her relationship and the breakup process is accurate. Moreover, uncoupling is a recognized sociological phenomenon. Diane Vaughan's Uncoupling brought widespread recognition to the concept of uncoupling and understanding breaking up as a process. According to Vaughan, uncoupling is the process in which individual members of a couple, usually one initially, begin to recognize that the relationship is no longer fulfilling their needs. Upon recognizing their dissatisfaction, the individual will begin the process of redefining the relationship and negotiating an individual identity separate from their coupled identity. Although potentially internal, the redefinition and negotiation processes possess a conscious element. Ultimately, the other partner will learn of their partner's dissatisfaction and too must engage in the conscious process of defining a new individual identity upon separation. In other words, couples must consciously uncouple.Unlike many couples, however, Paltrow and Martin must undergo the painful process of uncoupling in front of a very critical media. Given that breakups are as nuanced as the term consciously uncoupling indicates, Paltrow's ability to describe her separation in a less popularly recognized manner is courageous and insightful. Ideally, the media can cut Gwyneth some slack for her insights and respect her and Martin during their transition from couple to individuals."
7,DIVORCE,Should You Stay or Should You Go? Experts Weigh in on what's Better for Children When it Comes to Divorce,"Kids in the House, Contributor

The poised, loving way they chose to break the news only made the split sadder -- there seemed to be no acrimony, only a mutual decision for ""conscious uncoupling.""What Paltrow and Martin are going through resonates with millions of American parents, who are contemplating divorce: Is it better to stay or go? Throughout our Kids in the House interviews with the nation's best psychologists and relationship experts, we've gathered that there's no easy answer. Some argue that it's better to stick it out. Others strongly caution against staying in an unhappy union simply for the sake of your children. The Conflict Factor""A lot of parents ask me if they are in an unhappy marriage, whether or not they should stay together for the kids; whether it would be more beneficial for the kids,"" says Christine Carter, PhD, a sociologist and happiness expert at UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center and the author of Raising Happiness: 10 Simple Steps for More Joyful Kids and Happier Parents. ""The key question is really about conflict. What research shows is that conflict between two parents is what can be really damaging to kids. What's important is not whether or not you stay together, but the quality of your relationship. The particular measure of quality that is important here is how high conflict your relationship is. If you are in a really high conflict relationship, it would be better for the kids, in many cases, for you to dissolve that relationship."" In other words, if getting divorced is going to make it easier for you to get along with your spouse, your kids will be better off than if you stay married. But what exactly constitutes a ""high conflict marriage""? It's hard to say, because it's somewhat objective; a basic rule of thumb is if ""there is ongoing verbal abuse, physical abuse, swearing, screaming -- children are harmed in those situations and are much better off when the parents divorce,"" explains Joshua Coleman, PhD, author of The Marriage Makeover: Finding Happiness in Imperfect Harmony. ""When parents divorce from a high conflict marriage and go on to have happy lives, the kids do much better (than if they stay together).""Does Cheating = Divorce?What if your marriage isn't a highly volatile one, but your spouse has been unfaithful? Infidelity may seem like a deal-breaker to some, but as Tammy Nelson, PhD, author of The New Monogamy; Redefining Your Relationship After Infidelity explains, the the answer is hardly ever black or white: ""If you find out your partners cheating, and you have little kids at home, you may have a lot of well-meaning friends who are saying you should get out. (But) you're saying, how will I do that? How will I survive? How will I separate my family from their parent? What if I still love my partner?"" Nelson recommends seeking therapy and trying to ""bring the power struggle into the open,"" which can help set a better tone for the rest of the marriage if you choose to try to save your marriage after an affair. Mars/Venus author John Gray even suggests that an affair can be a catalyst for a stronger, happier marriage in the long run. ""There's this idea that if my partner has an affair, we have to get a divorce (instead of asking) can we find forgiveness? Can we find what the problem was that led our partner to that? And that's the whole key to everyone growing up. In truth, you can't know what real love is until your heart is broken. Real love is based on not expecting someone to be perfect, but realizing that all humans make mistakes, and part of love is learning to forgive, accept and grow.""Still, says Nelson, there are times when an affair might herald the end of a marriage. ""The other thing to think about -- and this is the flip side of the coin -- is that you don't want to make your kids responsible for your marriage. So if you really feel like this is not going to work, but we should stay together for the kids, you're putting your kids in a really perilous position. The first thing to do is confront it, talk about it, and get some professional help."" The Happiness Myth""People don't stay married for the sake of their children in the way that they used to and in part that's because parents today believe that if the parents are unhappy, then the kids are unhappy,"" says Coleman. What many of us forget, though, is that sometimes splitting up will result in a decrease in happiness, due to the effect divorce has on the other facets of our lives. Not all parents stay married for the sake of the children, but for the sake of themselves, because they can't stand the thought of being separated from their children... and in that situation, I think it's a completely reasonable thing to do. If getting a divorce means that you can only see your kid half the time, you really have to carefully think through that, because it may mean you're going to be a lot unhappier in divorce than you are being married to someone you're really not happy with.But Michelle Mahendra, an herbalist and divorced mom of one, says that fears about her child's future were what drove her to divorce.  My daughter was picking up on some unhappiness between the two of us and I didn't want to continue that path. I felt that in my own experience with my parents. My parents stayed together for far too long and they should have separated much earlier. And it led to a lot of issues that I ended up having with men that took me a very long time to resolve. And I wanted her to see that she could live by my example, that she would see that I was strong enough to walk away from a marriage that wasn't making me happy any more and that she could do the same thing. That she wouldn't stick around with someone and be unhappy for a long period of time, because she felt like she had to be.In the end, whether couples decide to stay together or split up depends on a variety of personal factors. ""If you've exhausted your possibilities of working it out, then it is worth it to your partner and to your kids to try to get into a happier situation, which will probably not happen immediately,"" explains Laura Wasser, a divorce attorney and author of It Doesn't Have to be That Way: How to Divorce Without Destroying Your Family or Bankrupting Yourself.  ""It will get worse before it gets better. But then it will be worth that turnaround in the relationship and within the family, emotional stability and adaptiveness of your kids.""
