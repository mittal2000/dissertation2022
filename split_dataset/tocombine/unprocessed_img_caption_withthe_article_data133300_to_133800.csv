Having family nearby is the best thing ever. There are so many delicious treats in Italy -- rich gelato, mouth-watering",2013-12-28,"This Nov. 9, 2013, photo shows the view looking east from the Academy Bridge in Venice, one of several free sights in the city. On a sunny day, when the Grand Canal is a sparkling ribbon of aquamarine embossed with boats ancient and modern, Venice can steal your heart. (AP Photo/Michelle Locke)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db8be2100003300c5a317.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you've spent time in Italy you know that life in Italy and life in America are very different. While both cultures have their pros and cons, we think Americans can learn a lot from the way Italians live. Traditionally, Italians have an easy-going and positive outlook on how to go about daily life. Italians live ""la vita bella"" (the beautiful life). But the beautiful life doesn't mean the luxurious life -- it means a relaxed, family-centric lifestyle.Check out seven lessons Americans can learn from Italians below.   1. Eat slowly, locally and with others. There's really no such thing as Italian fast food. Sure, you'll find a McDonald's here and there, but in Italy the concept of eating transcends ""fast and cheap."" Italy is all about ""slow food."" Dinners are unhurried and eaten around a table (not a TV or computer screen) with one's family. In Italy, food is natural, authentic and sourced locally. 2. Drink a little bit, but not too much. Italians love their vino. But they don't overdo it. Here in America, there's a culture of binge-drinking. In Italy, a bottle of wine is shared among friends or around the dinner table. Stumbling around drunk in Italy is not viewed favorably. Italians like to drink, but they know how to keep it classy. 3. You should indulge a little every now and then... perché no??There are so many delicious treats in Italy -- rich gelato, mouth-watering pastries, decadent chocolates. Much like the philosophy on drinking, Italian culture has a ""perché no?"" take on treats. ""Perché no?"" translates to ""why not?"" The idea is to treat yourself by having a little bit of something tasty (because, why not?) but not having so much that you're gorging yourself. Take Italian gelato shops for example... the normal size of a ""coppa"" (cup) would look tiny compared to the average size of a cup of ice cream in America.   4. Stop hurrying, start relaxing. Life is less hurried in Italy. People don't rush around with to-go cups of coffee, but rather sip their espresso at the ""bar"" (aka coffee shop). Meals tend to linger, whether they be at restaurants or at home. Pedestrians tend to meander. There's significantly less emphasis put on being on time -- rather, the emphasis falls on how that time is spent. Many Italians take a siesta of sorts -- a break during the day, from 1 p.m. - 3 p.m., to eat lunch and relax. 5. Having family nearby is the best thing ever. Families in Italy tend to stay in the same area, rather than moving around. Grandparents often care for grandchildren, siblings remain close and extended families are huge and welcoming. While it's more common in the U.S. to go away for college and settle down somewhere other than where you grew up, it tends to be the opposite in Italy. Having family nearby is deeply valued in Italy. Having nonna (grandma), aunts, uncles and cousins drop by for dinner during the week or having a weekly extended family meal every Sunday is common and brings everyone together.   6. Gather and spend time outdoors. Part of the great communal feel of Italy comes from the fact that people tend to congregate outdoors. Friends will meet up at a piazza and hang out there, rather than in a home. Piazzas are vibrant, outdoor hubs where tons of people gather, children play and tourists roam, creating a lively atmosphere. Similarly, many Italians do most of their shopping at a mercato, outdoor markets where vendors sell everything from food and wine to clothing and leather goods. In America, we have malls -- which are great. But there's nothing like wandering a mercato, sampling the fare and interacting with other locals. 7. Maintain a ""bella figura.""Bella figura literally translates to ""beautiful figure"" -- but it's more idiomatic than that. The idea of maintaining a bella figura is more like the idea of maintaining a good public image. Italians don't get drunk in public, eat while they walk or wear pajamas to the dinner table because it would have a negative impact on their image. Bella figura is more than just looking good, it's a way of life that emphasizes aesthetics and good behavior.  "

The U.S. Supreme Court opened the floodgates with its June ruling that overturned a 1996 ban on gay marriage, and the change has been swift. Judges in Utah, New Mexico and Ohio have all ruled in favor of gay marriage in the past week.

Of those, at least 74 percent, or 905 licenses, were issued to gay and lesbian couples.Marriage licenses in Utah cost between $30 and $50, depending on the county.With an average marriage license costing $40, counties in Utah made a grand total of more than $49,000 in the three-and-a-half days most county clerk’s offices were open this week.About three-quarters of that money came from gay and lesbian couples seeking marriage licenses in the immediate aftermath of U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby’s ruling that overturned a statewide ban on same-sex marriages.Salt Lake County shattered a previously held record of 85 marriages in a given day, by handing out 353 on Monday (Dec. 23) — the first full day of issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.On the other hand, Piute, a small county of about 1,500 people in the center of the state, was of several counties with no takers. Had any Piute couples requested a license, they would have been denied anyway.County Clerk Valeen Brown is on vacation until Monday (Dec. 30), officials said. So, Piute officials suspended all marriage license activity until Brown returns.Utah County — which made national news this week when Shelly Eyre and her partner Cheryl Haws declared that they would sue its clerk for denying gay and lesbian couples — was doling out certificates Thursday to all.“Moving forward, we probably won’t keep track of how many same-sex couples versus opposite-sex couples we issue licenses to,” said Bryan Thompson, the county’s clerk and auditor. “I don’t see any reason to differentiate between them.”(Marissa Lang writes for The Salt Lake Tribune.)"

Second, the failure had to occur in 2013 and require significant response from the company. Third, the product’s failure had to end up inflicting sizable damage to the company’s bottom line, its reputation, or both.Some of the products on our list, like the Samsung Galaxy smartwatch, a combination of a communication device and a fashion statement, may have simply been ahead of their time. Others, like the see-through Lululemon yoga pants, were an embarrassment that top management unfortunately made worse. And then there were epic flops, like the HealthCare.gov Internet portal, which will probably end up as a case study in business, political science and sociology textbooks for years to come.A fair number of the flops came from the IT sector — not very surprising when you consider how rapidly technologies are evolving and how fickle consumers can be about the latest smartphone or tablet. But there were also tone-deaf exercises in creativity, like “The Lone Ranger,” which set new standards for cinematic fiascos.These are the worst product flops of 2013, according to 24/7 Wall St.: "

The big get for 2013 was reaching 90 million unique visitors a month, according to the company, on par with the likes of eBay. This season, even Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates joined its Secret Santa gift exchange.Now, the self-dubbed ""Front Page of the Internet"" is going for a milestone it has been trying to reach since its founding in 2005: profitability.After years of fitful experiments with paid subscriptions and display advertising, Reddit, with just 28 employees, has begun pouring resources into building an electronic bazaar.Company executives say they increasingly believe such a venue is the answer to their long search for reliable revenue, complicated in part by their fans' mistrust of advertising.If Reddit Gifts, as the burgeoning bazaar is known, brings sustainable profitability, it would mark a turning point for an outfit that has exerted an outsized and sometimes controversial influence on Internet culture yet languished financially.Reddit estimates over 250,000 items have been purchased over the holiday, mostly as part of the 50 or so mostly geek-oriented Secret Santa gift exchanges - where zombie- or fantasy-themed presents, say, change hands - that users have created.Although Reddit won't disclose details about how much money it has made from Reddit Gifts or its overall financial performance, it takes a 15 to 20 percent cut of every purchase.Usually priced between $10 and $25, the goods reflect Reddit's young and geeky user base, from collages of cats in steampunk apparel to coffee mugs branded by Imgur.com, a repository of funny Web pictures, to an entire category dedicated to bacon-related products. More than 250 merchants supply gifts curated and ""up-voted"" by the community, much as articles and links are elevated on the Reddit site itself.'JUST GROW THINGS'The gift exchange made headlines this month after Gates signed up and surprised a Reddit user by sending her a travel book and a stuffed cow, symbol of the charity he donated to in her name.The company, which is hoping to position itself as a bona fide shopping destination year-round, estimates that only 14 percent of its marketplace revenue comes from the Christmas-season gift exchange programs.Yet those sales alone could put Reddit firmly in the black, said Dan McComas, the head of Reddit Gifts. He added that the company may choose to reinvest funds in e-commerce customer service and infrastructure.Chief Executive Yishan Wong, a former Facebook executive, said Reddit was ""kind of"" breaking even and denied that pressure was mounting on his team to turn a profit.In 2011, Reddit was spun out as an independently operated subsidiary by corporate parent Conde Nast, an old-line magazine empire best known for publishing Vanity Fair, Vogue and The New Yorker. Industry observers surmised at the time that the move was a step toward eventually selling off a stake to outside investors.""Our backers are saying, 'Don't worry about making money, just keep money and grow things,'"" Wong said in an interview. ""But I would like Reddit to be self-sustaining because I think that's a healthy way for a business to run. It means that what you're doing provides real value, and Reddit Gifts is so promising because it can do that.""Wong said he saw potential in Gifts earlier this year and began staffing up the effort to eight people.Although Wong is giddy about Gifts' impact on its finances, what scale the business could reach remains unclear. Wong said he did not envision Reddit posing a threat to folksy arts and crafts e-tailers like Etsy; Reddit could carve out a space with a geekier sensibility.""I don't believe in going after someone else's market, but going after a new market of our own could be huge by itself,"" Wong said.THE NICHE FACTORFacebook struggled for years to develop a marketplace because its users aren't in a shopping mindset when they log on.The same could be said for Reddit, known for its forums on politics or technology rather than for deals or flash sales, said Krista Garcia, an analyst at eMarketer, a consulting firm. A media company that enters the e-commerce business may also be caught off guard by the complexities of logistics or customer service, she added.""Reddit and commerce is an odd pairing, but there is more potential there versus Facebook because it's more niche,"" Garcia said. ""I could see them tapping into a much more passionate audience. They need to bring the right products and merchandise that's unusual or unique.""Reddit's place at the vanguard of Internet culture - where jokes and memes gain traction alongside political debates or discussions of breaking news - is also far from assured in a fickle Web arena. Rivals like Digg.com have rapidly declined.The site's hands-off attitude toward content has drawn criticism, particularly about some loosely moderated forums where, for example, pictures of women being beaten are freely disseminated.Reddit's reputation also suffered after forum members mistakenly identified a missing Brown University student as a suspect in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. The rumor, which was recirculated by mainstream journalists, blazed across Twitter before authorities said they were seeking Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.'FAMILY FRIENDLY'Conde Nast acquired Reddit for a reported $20 million in 2006 but largely left it running independently for five years, as its viewership ballooned fivefold.ComScore estimates it drew 21.7 million unique desktop visitors in November, up from 8.7 million a year ago. Reddit's own estimate is more than four times that.The company struggled for years to find a suitable business model because its community identified with an antiestablishment ethos and distrusted heavy advertising, Wong said.Reddit Gifts was born in 2009 as an independent project created by McComas, a software developer and longtime Reddit user. He was brought on in 2011, and with Wong's blessing has been hiring staff to work out of an $800-a-month apartment in Salt Lake City.Unlike Reddit's sometimes laissez-faire approach to moderating its forums, Reddit Gifts will be curated to be ""family friendly"" as it grows, said McComas, who envisioned limiting the number of merchants to give them more individual exposure.Brian Linss, a former Yahoo technician who lives near Portland, said he has supported himself making TV- and film-inspired artwork since he began selling on Reddit six months ago.While he was able to make $1,500 to $2,000 during a ""great"" month on Etsy, Linss said he now makes four times as much in a good month, where his posters about the hit cable series ""Breaking Bad"" move swiftly.""Reddit is trying to assemble those merchants, and I think there's a huge gap in the market for it,"" Linss said. ""People that didn't have access to that geek culture before now have an easy portal to things that they're not going to find at their local retailer.""(Editing by Edwin Chan, Martin Howell and Prudence Crowther)"

Reversals of this nature are somewhat rare in the marketing world and I for one usually recommend that a brand stick to its position on issues. But I guess A&E was using the show's hiatus as time to sort out its game plan. The Christmas Day marathon of the show should have clued us in to what that game plan might be.  Now I am not going to comment on whether this is right or wrong, because every one is entitled to their views and entitled to express them. I choose to do that privately. But I do want to comment on how it appears that A&E is giving the show what I would call a ""brand pass,"" something others before them have not had the luxury.Take a look at Justine Sacco who just recently sent what's been called a ""careless"" and ""thoughtless"" tweet that cost her a job and potentially a career. Paula Deen and her Brand have not recovered, nor have people like Michael Richards whose Wikipedia profile now cites his errs right along side his accomplishments. So why is Duck Dynasty getting a ""brand pass"" this time around? This is a family that knows its brand, that's for sure. So is it Phil's apology? Well others have done that too, quite ceremoniously. Is it a profit motive, as many have suggested? Not sure, because that has certainly been a factor in other cases as well. The petitions? I can't imagine it's that; we've seen ""movements"" just as big cause no effect.Perhaps it's the network's announced discussions with advocacy groups and the agreed PSAs that will launch across their lineup. OK, I could buy that from a marketing point of view. Cooperation has long solved a lot of problems so I am all for that. It's a form of public rehab that might help if done sincerely and correctly, and could build the brands even further.Let's hope this game plan does help erase some of the ill effect that such comments have so surely caused those who continue to suffer from discrimination and self-hatred from just being who they are. At the end of the day, we choose to tune in or not, which is the ultimate power we all possess. I just hope that in this case, the network and the show use their paid and sponsored platform to do some good, reversing some of the bad."

Allison Kaye, GM of Scooter Braun Projects, released the following statement after Bieber's Christmas Eve tweets:Justin is a hard working 19 year old who would prefer that his recent fundraising work in the Philippines and the considerable amount raised for the cause be the media’s focus more than the recent reporting on him retiring.

The 46-year-old actress sat down with Amy Kaufman from the Los Angeles Times to talk about her transition into motherhood and how it reflects on her career. ""I think people like to say that I'm super picky because of how much I l-oo-ve my kids. But as an actor, I sort of pride myself on the fact that I've always been picky,"" Roberts explained to the paper. Roberts has been married to cinematographer Daniel Moder for 11 years, and the couple have three children together. At this point in her life, those kids have become her top priority. ""We try to protect our kids. We just want to have our family life and not have that intruded upon,"" Roberts told USA Today in a separate interview.Speaking to the Times, Roberts also explained how age plays a part in her decision making. ""For one, I'm 46 years old, so falling out of chairs isn't as funny. I could break a hip,"" Roberts said. ""Certain scenarios that worked 10 years ago aren't as appealing, as applicable, as believable, as original -- all those things."" These factors have directed Roberts away from many of the big romantic comedies she became famous for, and have allowed her to focus on the roles that inspire her most, like ""August: Osage County."" The new film finds Roberts in unfamiliar territory, playing a depressed mother on the cusp of a divorce.""Julia, when we first started talking about it, that was our question,"" director John Wells told HuffPost Entertainment when asked about the decision to cast Roberts in such an against-type role. ""This is an embittered, angry woman in her mid-40s, and it's going to be a lot of time spent not being a very nice person. Julia has a screen persona that she has not exclusively done, but done often, where people sort of expect her to be a certain way. None of that was going to be what we're doing. She said, 'Yeah, that's exactly why I want to do it.'""The actress credits her career's development and success to finding fame in a time when she was allowed to be herself. ""Nobody expected me to be anybody but myself, really,"" she recalled. For more of Roberts' interview, and her hopes for niece, Emma Roberts, read the full story at the Los Angeles Times website."

It might seem an impossible dream come true, but one that is clearly hand-in-glove with la forza del Destino. It all started with a few timely e-mails from Jeffrey which dovetailed with another strategic announcement -- Glenn Dicterow, Concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic since 1980, would be retiring at the end of the 2013-14 season. ""I thought that if I didn't ask him then,"" said Jeffrey, ""I never would.""Regarding his retirement, Glenn told me he was already nostalgic about it. ""So often, I'll go out and play a very well known work and realize it's for the last time. For instance, in Vail, Colorado, when we were in residence there this past summer, I played my last Scheherazade. A few weeks ago, I played my last Thus Spake Zarathustra by Richard Strauss. Being on stage, being enveloped by that sound -- I don't think that's going to happen again. It's been almost forty years, counting my L.A. Philharmonic days. It's going to be bittersweet. I won't get that feeling again, to sit among that many great musicians and have a huge Mahler symphony sound. I will miss that part of it."" GLENN DICTEROW. Photo, courtesy of the artistShortly after sparking the violinist's attention, Jeffrey contacted Robert DeMaine, Principal Cellist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic since 2012. The three musicians agreed to meet October 28th, in Manhattan, at Steinway Hall on 57th Street. They would do a single read-through of the Brahms C Major Trio. ""The piece is so incredible,"" said Glenn. ""It's why people gravitate toward piano trios. The sound is so complete.""""I'm going into a part of my life,"" said Jeffrey, where I really want to embrace the old world style of playing that is really more me in a way. I'm not saying I won't do new things. But in regard to chamber music, I wanted to 'go home'. Timing is everything, of course. It was a very beautiful sound that came into that room at Steinway Hall -- and I'm speaking more from the standpoint of the strings. A pianist is going to support and weave around the texture. But the string players must have a magic within themselves. I think those two have that magic -- that kind of instinctive intersection of sound where they breathe together, almost like one instrument, encompassing the range of the violin and cello. That's what makes it work and why they hit it off so well. They spoke the same language. That's first base for any kind of chamber group.""I went to New York thinking nothing was going to come of this,"" said Robert DeMaine.I've admired Glenn Dicterow my whole life. I grew up as this kid in Oklahoma City watching PBS broadcasts and seeing Glenn Dicterow on television every time the New York Philharmonic was on. I really do look up to him immensely. And Jeffrey, too. In my opinion, both Jeffrey and Glenn are two of the greatest living performers on their instruments. I've had a lot of great collaborative music-making. When we met at Steinway -- in one of those hallowed rooms, where all of these great instrumentalists have played -- none of us were warmed-up. It was first thing in the morning. I had just taken a redeye from L.A. and was not in my top form. But the atmosphere in the room was right. I just knew it. It belonged that way.As I spoke to each of the musicians, the term ""old school"" kept popping up. With Jeffrey being in the middle at 52 and at least a decade's difference younger than Glenn, and Robert just turning 44 -- each of them had a different hit on old school.""When I heard Jeffrey for the first time,"" said Glenn, I thanked God that I have YouTube. I saw the video of him doing the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2 and thought 'this is the old school way of playing' -- something that speaks to me. I am Old School! I'm very much inspired by the great artists of the 1900s, from Heifetz and Horowitz onwards. That's where I get most of my musical inspirations. Even though Jeffrey is younger than I am, it is very much the same. I heard Robert DeMaine when he was on tour with the L.A. Philharmonic and played at Avery Fisher Hall. Dudamel was conducting. On the first half, they played a more contemporary piece that had a lot of cello solos. I heard that sound and I was very drawn to it. Two months ago, the three of us are sitting at Steinway Hall. Everything clicked -- we all understood each other -- three like minds in sort-of old school philosophy. Everything just gelled. Then we said, 'Let's get a name!' and Jeffrey came up with it. He is a go-getter, as you know. JEFFREY BIEGEL. Photo, courtesy of the artistFor Jeffrey Biegel, old school is about returning to the time when the music was composed. In an increasingly fast-paced world, where technology is pushing everything to warp speed, both artist and consumer want everything quick and easy. When Glen Dicterow plays, you know he has had many years of playing under great conductors such as Zubin Mehta, Kurt Masur. It makes a difference, I hear it in his sound. A lot of the music we see most frequently, even pre-1950 / pre-television -- is already old school because the world is slower. Communication was slower then, the pace was slower. I'm sure the big cities were hustling and bustling, but the speed of communication was slower. People took time to get results. People living in a faster world expect results to come faster. In the musical sense, when you take more time, you end up delving deeper into the music. You don't just learn it quickly for a concert and go flying-out the next morning. Old School is not just the repertoire, it's the speed in which we learned, the time that people took to do things. For myself, it's in the way I was trained. The reason why I get the sound I want is because I was exposed to it by people like Adele Marcus. I was lucky that way.For young cellist Robert DeMaine, I framed the question with a slightly different twist. How does he respond when young students ask him about training, especially with all the connotations of old school in mind?""Old school is evocative of a generation that is no longer with us,"" said Robert. The Grim Reaper was busy this past year. With the passing of cellist János Starker, it's almost like the death of an era right there. I would recommend to young students to not be so obsessed with the superstar cellists who are around today. There is an instant gratification and availability with these things through YouTube. It's staggering! I'm convinced that if YouTube had existed when I was a kid, I would be a much better cellist than I am today. The danger in that, is that kids often think you learn just by watching videos instead of having a great teacher. In this area, there's no such thing as being a successful autodidact. You have to apprentice. You have to work with a master. You have to earn your wings from Day One. You have to practice scales and arpeggios and go to tons of concerts and approach everything with humility. ROBERT DeMAINE. Photo, courtesy of the artistWhen people ask me how I built my career -- 'How did you get to where you are?' -- without going into too much detail, I'll say that I never expected to be a Principal Cellist in a major orchestra. But that's how it ended up. What I realized is that opportunity comes in many forms and it doesn't just knock on the front door. It knocks on the back door, it comes from the basement. You have to see that opportunity when it presents itself, even if it seems trivial. There's no prescribed formula for it, you need to make your own story. That's where the magic is. Everybody has their own little mountain to climb -- or their own little dig, whatever. In my own little corner of the world, I can take care of my mountain. I don't believe in living my life out of a text book. I don't prescribe to the rules all the time. Eventually, we have to come up with our own way of doing things. I idolized the great French cellist, Pierre Fournier. His sound spoke to me from a very early age.Now it's on to professional management, bookings, social media, recordings and fans like me swarming backstage. ""There are a lot of different variables at play,"" said Robert. If a series wants a certain theme in the program or if they want a certain menu like a Classical trio, a Romantic trio, something 20th Century -- it doesn't matter what nationality -- they will give us that. Some presenters are more apt to give us free reign. I think most often they would probably defer to the group. As far as the decision-making within the group, I feel it will probably be absolutely mutual. In a way, it's a little bit more up to the pianist because there are so many more notes. That's not to say the piano is a more difficult instrument -- you know? -- all they do is press buttons! I'm sure that Jeffrey has got it all mapped out. When you're a musician of his caliber, you are juggling -- not oranges, but chainsaws. Jeffrey's got, like, ten chainsaws in the air. No matter how many of them are ready to come down, he's always thinking outside the box. He visualizes these projects and I'm sure this is one of dozens that he's got on his plate. I so admire that - this creating out of nothing.Click here to stay in touch."

That's first base for any kind of chamber group.""I went to New York thinking nothing was going to come of this,"" said Robert DeMaine.I've admired Glenn Dicterow my whole life. I grew up as this kid in Oklahoma City watching PBS broadcasts and seeing Glenn Dicterow on television every time the New York Philharmonic was on. I really do look up to him immensely. And Jeffrey, too. In my opinion, both Jeffrey and Glenn are two of the greatest living performers on their instruments. I've had a lot of great collaborative music-making. When we met at Steinway -- in one of those hallowed rooms, where all of these great instrumentalists have played -- none of us were warmed-up. It was first thing in the morning. I had just taken a redeye from L.A. and was not in my top form. But the atmosphere in the room was right. I just knew it. It belonged that way.As I spoke to each of the musicians, the term ""old school"" kept popping up. With Jeffrey being in the middle at 52 and at least a decade's difference younger than Glenn, and Robert just turning 44 -- each of them had a different hit on old school.""When I heard Jeffrey for the first time,"" said Glenn, I thanked God that I have YouTube. I saw the video of him doing the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2 and thought 'this is the old school way of playing' -- something that speaks to me. I am Old School! I'm very much inspired by the great artists of the 1900s, from Heifetz and Horowitz onwards. That's where I get most of my musical inspirations. Even though Jeffrey is younger than I am, it is very much the same. I heard Robert DeMaine when he was on tour with the L.A. Philharmonic and played at Avery Fisher Hall. Dudamel was conducting. On the first half, they played a more contemporary piece that had a lot of cello solos. I heard that sound and I was very drawn to it. Two months ago, the three of us are sitting at Steinway Hall. Everything clicked -- we all understood each other -- three like minds in sort-of old school philosophy. Everything just gelled. Then we said, 'Let's get a name!' and Jeffrey came up with it. He is a go-getter, as you know. JEFFREY BIEGEL. Photo, courtesy of the artistFor Jeffrey Biegel, old school is about returning to the time when the music was composed. In an increasingly fast-paced world, where technology is pushing everything to warp speed, both artist and consumer want everything quick and easy. When Glen Dicterow plays, you know he has had many years of playing under great conductors such as Zubin Mehta, Kurt Masur. It makes a difference, I hear it in his sound. A lot of the music we see most frequently, even pre-1950 / pre-television -- is already old school because the world is slower. Communication was slower then, the pace was slower. I'm sure the big cities were hustling and bustling, but the speed of communication was slower. People took time to get results. People living in a faster world expect results to come faster. In the musical sense, when you take more time, you end up delving deeper into the music. You don't just learn it quickly for a concert and go flying-out the next morning. Old School is not just the repertoire, it's the speed in which we learned, the time that people took to do things. For myself, it's in the way I was trained. The reason why I get the sound I want is because I was exposed to it by people like Adele Marcus. I was lucky that way.For young cellist Robert DeMaine, I framed the question with a slightly different twist. How does he respond when young students ask him about training, especially with all the connotations of old school in mind?""Old school is evocative of a generation that is no longer with us,"" said Robert. The Grim Reaper was busy this past year. With the passing of cellist János Starker, it's almost like the death of an era right there. I would recommend to young students to not be so obsessed with the superstar cellists who are around today. There is an instant gratification and availability with these things through YouTube. It's staggering! I'm convinced that if YouTube had existed when I was a kid, I would be a much better cellist than I am today. The danger in that, is that kids often think you learn just by watching videos instead of having a great teacher. In this area, there's no such thing as being a successful autodidact. You have to apprentice. You have to work with a master. You have to earn your wings from Day One. You have to practice scales and arpeggios and go to tons of concerts and approach everything with humility. ROBERT DeMAINE. Photo, courtesy of the artistWhen people ask me how I built my career -- 'How did you get to where you are?' -- without going into too much detail, I'll say that I never expected to be a Principal Cellist in a major orchestra. But that's how it ended up. What I realized is that opportunity comes in many forms and it doesn't just knock on the front door. It knocks on the back door, it comes from the basement. You have to see that opportunity when it presents itself, even if it seems trivial. There's no prescribed formula for it, you need to make your own story. That's where the magic is. Everybody has their own little mountain to climb -- or their own little dig, whatever. In my own little corner of the world, I can take care of my mountain. I don't believe in living my life out of a text book. I don't prescribe to the rules all the time. Eventually, we have to come up with our own way of doing things. I idolized the great French cellist, Pierre Fournier. His sound spoke to me from a very early age.Now it's on to professional management, bookings, social media, recordings and fans like me swarming backstage. ""There are a lot of different variables at play,"" said Robert. If a series wants a certain theme in the program or if they want a certain menu like a Classical trio, a Romantic trio, something 20th Century -- it doesn't matter what nationality -- they will give us that. Some presenters are more apt to give us free reign. I think most often they would probably defer to the group. As far as the decision-making within the group, I feel it will probably be absolutely mutual. In a way, it's a little bit more up to the pianist because there are so many more notes. That's not to say the piano is a more difficult instrument -- you know? -- all they do is press buttons! I'm sure that Jeffrey has got it all mapped out. When you're a musician of his caliber, you are juggling -- not oranges, but chainsaws. Jeffrey's got, like, ten chainsaws in the air. No matter how many of them are ready to come down, he's always thinking outside the box. He visualizes these projects and I'm sure this is one of dozens that he's got on his plate. I so admire that - this creating out of nothing.Click here to stay in touch."

It might seem an impossible dream come true, but one that is clearly hand-in-glove with la forza del Destino. It all started with a few timely e-mails from Jeffrey which dovetailed with another strategic announcement -- Glenn Dicterow, Concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic since 1980, would be retiring at the end of the 2013-14 season. ""I thought that if I didn't ask him then,"" said Jeffrey, ""I never would.""Regarding his retirement, Glenn told me he was already nostalgic about it. ""So often, I'll go out and play a very well known work and realize it's for the last time. For instance, in Vail, Colorado, when we were in residence there this past summer, I played my last Scheherazade. A few weeks ago, I played my last Thus Spake Zarathustra by Richard Strauss. Being on stage, being enveloped by that sound -- I don't think that's going to happen again. It's been almost forty years, counting my L.A. Philharmonic days. It's going to be bittersweet. I won't get that feeling again, to sit among that many great musicians and have a huge Mahler symphony sound. I will miss that part of it."" GLENN DICTEROW. Photo, courtesy of the artistShortly after sparking the violinist's attention, Jeffrey contacted Robert DeMaine, Principal Cellist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic since 2012. The three musicians agreed to meet October 28th, in Manhattan, at Steinway Hall on 57th Street. They would do a single read-through of the Brahms C Major Trio. ""The piece is so incredible,"" said Glenn. ""It's why people gravitate toward piano trios. The sound is so complete.""""I'm going into a part of my life,"" said Jeffrey, where I really want to embrace the old world style of playing that is really more me in a way. I'm not saying I won't do new things. But in regard to chamber music, I wanted to 'go home'. Timing is everything, of course. It was a very beautiful sound that came into that room at Steinway Hall -- and I'm speaking more from the standpoint of the strings. A pianist is going to support and weave around the texture. But the string players must have a magic within themselves. I think those two have that magic -- that kind of instinctive intersection of sound where they breathe together, almost like one instrument, encompassing the range of the violin and cello. That's what makes it work and why they hit it off so well. They spoke the same language.
