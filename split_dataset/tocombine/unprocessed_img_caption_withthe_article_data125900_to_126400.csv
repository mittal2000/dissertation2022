""That settlement includes (a) the issuance of an apology by GoldieBlox, which will be posted on GoldieBlox's website, and (b) a payment by GoldieBlox, based on a percentage of its revenues, to one or more charities selected by Beastie Boys that support science, technology, engineering and mathematics education for girls."" The apology has not yet been posted on GoldieBlox’s website but is expected to appear later this afternoon, The Verge reports.Based out of Oakland, California, GoldieBlox creates construction and building toys for girls to fight the stereotype that such engineer play is just for boys. The company’s explosive YouTube video last year featuring three girls, their Rube Goldberg machine and a parody of the Beastie Boys’ 1987 hit “Girls” excited parents and advocates for Girls in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) programs but upset the band, whose late member Adam Yauch had stipulated in his will that none of the band’s music ever be used in advertisements. GoldieBlox replaced the song out of respect for Yauch’s dying wish but filed a lawsuit in November seeking a declaration that the song used was a fair-use parody since they altered the arguably misogynistic lyrics to reflect the company’s opposing message. The Beastie Boys filed a counterclaim lawsuit the following month alleging copyright and trademark infringement, false advertising, false endorsement and unfair competition.When the lawsuits were first filed, legal experts speculated that GoldieBlox wouldn’t have a leg to stand on in the case if the Beastie Boys original lyrics “Girls, to do the dishes / Girls, to clean up my room” were actually satire with the same message as the company’s parody. “My impression of the original song has always been that it's so over-the-top, that it seems to be a commentary unto itself on that macho party lifestyle of most hip-hop bands at the time,” Boston attorney Steven M. Ayr told Vulture. “I think (GoldieBlox’s) argument fails if the song, at the heart of it, isn't really as sexist as it would be if you took it literally. And the Beastie Boys specifically state in their response that this was a ‘sarcastic anthem,’ which would go to undermining the claim of parody.” "

Bon Appetit",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/9-rules-for-naked-dining_us_5b9def52e4b03a1dcc8f0d49,"Once upon a time, etiquette was important.",2014-03-18,2014-03-18-C389douard_Manet__Le_DC3A9jeuner_sur_lherbe620x620.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-03-18-C389douard_Manet__Le_DC3A9jeuner_sur_lherbe620x620-thumb.jpeg,"by Ruth Wertzberger CarlsonOnce upon a time, etiquette was important: One needed to know which fork to use, which glass to sip from. Those days, my friends, are over. Now, questions of etiquette mainly revolve around how many Instagrams each guest is allowed to take during dinner.But there remains one corner of the world where table etiquette remains a vexing and important issue: at nude resorts. And it's a problem for a growing number of people.""We're seeing a rise in 'nakations,' especially among people in their thirties,'"" says Sue Nerud, spokesperson for the American Association for Nude Recreation. Exact statistics are hard to come by, however, since many nudists prefer to remain anonymous. (In fact, several nudists in this article spoke only on the condition their names not be used.) And while Nerud said recent studies show that nakations are great stress relievers, there remain those pesky etiquette issues -- which we are about to solve for you!1. Towel On: ""Naked butts at the table are a big no-no,"" says travel writer and photographer David Lansing, who likes to take off his press hat (and everything else) at nudist resorts around the world. For reasons of basic health and safety, everyone brings a towel to sit on. More proof that, as fans of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy know all too well, a towel is ""the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker"" -- or hungry nudist -- ""can have.""2. Just Because We're All Naked Doesn't Mean We're All Friends: ""You should wait to be invited to a table,"" says Lansing. ""This isn't like going on a cruise; even though there may be eight or 10 people at a large table, they usually all know each other, and there will be a very uncomfortable pause in the conversation if you just sit down at a table uninvited. That said, nudists are some of the friendliest people I've met and invariably you'll be asked to join one group or another for lunch or dinner. But do wait to be asked.""3. Listen to Your Mother -- Use a Napkin! ""As a matter of etiquette,"" says advice columnist April Masini, ""covering your private parts with a napkin while at a nudist event is good manners the same way not chewing with your mouth open is. We all know it's there; we all know what's happening; we don't need to see everything at dinner. Just because you take your clothes off doesn't mean you should strip yourself of manners.""SEE MORE:22 Recipes Everyone Should Know How to Cook4. Some Don't Like It Hot: ""Most nudists resorts will hold traditional barbecues, and first-timers need to be careful around the 'weenie roast,'"" says Tom Mulhall, who owns the Terra Cotta Inn in Palm Springs, California, and blogs about nudism on The Huffington Post. Nor is the grill the only danger -- the dinner table, too, can be hazardous. ""Don't allow your waiter to serve you a bowl of hot soup. He can spill into your lap,"" notes photography instructor Eugene Louie, who visits clothing-optional resorts for self-reflection. 4. Listen to Your Mother, Part 2: ""Sit up straight,"" says Masini. ""Good posture at the dinner table is always a way to show good breeding and good manners, but when you're nude, slouching and elbows akimbo are not only more noticeable -- they create a silhouette that is less attractive than if you have clothes on. Sit up straight!""5. No One Will Pardon Your Reach: ""Don't reach -- even if you think it's not a reach,"" says Masini. ""Nude or naturist dining requires a greater margin of coordination and control. Without a bra, and with a well-endowed chest, reaching -- even a little -- may result in your breasts in the marinara sauce.""6. There Is Such a Thing as Too Casual. ""Casual dining doesn't mean you can put your ankle across your knee, or your feet up on the coffee table -- even if it's an outdoor barbecue with paper plates,"" says Masini. ""Reconsider the view others will have while eating."" Of course, if you keep a napkin in your lap, this won't be an issue.SEE MORE: 23 Spring Recipes For Warmer Weather7. Eyes Up Here, Buddy! ""I'd say the most important table etiquette for nudists is no staring,"" says Lansing. ""It's not unusual for nudists to just wrap a gauzy sarong around them as they go straight from the pool (or beach) to the table, so you want to try really hard to maintain eye contact."" Instead of discussing people's bodies, it's safer to talk about the food.8. Food Porn, OK. Real Porn, No Way! Go ahead and Instagram your dinner if the resort allows it, says Nerud, but don't shoot other guests unless they sign a photo release form.9. Chill Out: If you're nervous about dining in the buff, don't be. The resort owners I spoke to all said concerns about being naked usually go away after 15 minutes. Nude dining seems naturally relaxing: You don't have to think about what to wear (or dry-cleaning bills), and you never have to loosen your belt if you overeat. Although, actually, I can't think of a better motivation to lose weight than the fact that everyone can see your gut (and everything else).See more from Bon Appetit:25 Ways to Use Sriracha 10 Snacks You Thought Were Healthy But Aren't 10 Restaurants from Books and Movies That Became RealYou'll Never Guess What These Grammy Outfits Remind Us Of"

He built the customized desk to see how the movement would effect his productivity, workflow and overall health. He works up to eight hours a day, walking up to 12 miles each day. He says he feels better and his energy level remains steady throughout the day.

Researchers from the University of Texas at Arlington, the Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota found that treadmill workstation users burned 74 more calories a day, on average, than they did before using the devices. And even though their work performance did take a hit immediately after transitioning from a typical cubicle desk to the treadmill desk, the employees' overall performance over the course of a year improved based on self ratings and supervisor ratings. ""Our study suggests that it is important to examine nonlinear effects over a relatively long period of time. Had we ignored nonlinearity or considered only discrete changes over arbitrary periods, we would have not estimated correctly the effects of treadmill workstations on physical activity and work performance,"" the researchers wrote in the PLOS ONE study. ""Training in the use of treadmills for different tasks may shorten the adjustment and learning period, thus enhancing the positive effect of treadmill workstations.""The study included about 200 employees who worked at a nonprofit financial services company, all of whom had sedentary jobs that involved a lot of time spent in front of a computer. Some of the employees had their cubicles and offices installed with treadmill desks; they were permitted to use the treadmill desks, walking at speeds up to 2 miles per hour, as often as they wanted to (meaning they could choose to stand, sit or walk on the desks). They also wore accelerometers to track their energy expenditure. ""Walking on the treadmill didn't come at the expense of being a productive worker,"" study researcher Darla Hamann, assistant professor in the School of Urban and Public Affairs at UT Arlington, said in a statement. ""Walking seemed to augment productivity."" Do you use a treadmill desk at your office? Would you try one? Check out this account of a workday spent using one.  "

We want this glorious little European country from ""The Princess Diaries"" to be a real place and clearly the Internet does too. It's pretty rad and if it were real, we'd be doing a hard sell on why you should visit.Here's where to find Genovia on a map.  Cute little country tucked right in between Spain and France.** That means it's relatively easy to get to and could be a quick addition to any European backpacking adventure. Monuments, palaces and castles, oh my! They, apparently (thanks internet!), have a vast number of castles and palaces to visit. There are historical sites to see and government buildings to tour. Genovia is rich in history, after all.Oh and THIS is the White House of Genovia.  Maybe more like the Buckingham Palace of Genovia, but you get the picture. (Fun fact: This is actually Longford Castle in Wiltshire, England. So technically you can go see the White House of Genovia if you really want to.) Who's in charge?

With pears being the official national fruit and officially delicious, you'll find them in almost every meal and even the floral arrangements. Cities on cities on cities.  Genovia is chock full o' cities to see. Danberry is the second largest city, offering many parks to stroll in. King Herbert's Island is off the coast of Genovia and arguably the biggest tourist attraction with its fancy hotels and sandy beaches.They have a superb national anthem. So while we know Genovia is not actually a real destination, if it were, we'd absolutely be adding it to our European bucket list. **Special note: We are talking about the movie version of Genovia, not the book.

In addition, optimistic thinkers zero in on what they can control, influence or leverage.",2014-03-17,2014-03-12-Small7ThingsResilientCouplesDoDifferently.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-03-12-Small7ThingsResilientCouplesDoDifferently-thumb.jpg,"My husband and I recently celebrated our 10-year anniversary, and it has caused me to reflect on the twelve years that we have known each other. As a teacher of resilience, defined as the ability to bounce back and grow and thrive during challenge, change and stress, I wanted to examine the traits that helped couples remain resilient. I looked at those relationships that worked, didn't work, and the research to compile these seven hallmarks of resilience in relationships: 1. CARE rather than confront during tough conversations.  Resilient couples know how to communicate assertively -- that is, in a clear, confident and controlled manner. While that's easier said than done, particularly with tough conversations, here's a model to help:C -- Communicate the facts.  A -- Address your concerns in an objective way R -- Reach out and ask the other person for his/her perspective E -- Evaluate outcomesMost importantly, do your homework before you even have the conversation. Ask yourself whether you have an accurate understanding of the problem. I'm always embarrassed when I have a conversation with someone only to realize I never really fully understood the issue. (1)2. Find your ""I want"" power.  Relationships can take a little (and some days, a lot of) self-discipline. Stanford health psychologist, Dr. Kelly McGonigal, coined the phrase ""I want"" power, and it's an important component of self-control. (2) ""I want"" power is the ability to find your motivation when it really matters -- that important long-term goal that you want to focus your time and energy on. What are you working toward as a couple? Whatever it is, you need to be able to tap into this ""I want"" power when your willpower reserves are running low.3. Connect during daily transition points.  I don't know about you, but my mornings tend to be busy getting ready for the day, and then when I get home from work, I'm exhausted and focused on starting dinner and other tasks. Resilient couples acknowledge each other at distinct transition points during the day: waking up, leaving for the day, coming back together at the end of the day and going to sleep. The acknowledgement can be as simple as a kiss, hug, smile or touch. 4. Help each other relive good news. Human beings are hard-wired to notice and remember negative news and events. That's why you stand at the ready when your partner says, ""Hey, I have a problem!"" But what do you do when your partner says, ""I've got great news?"" How you respond to the good news is as important for the health of your relationship as how you respond to bad news according to psychologist, Dr. Shelly Gable. Killing the conversation by offering a short acknowledgement (""Hey, that's great"") or hijacking the conversation by making it about you (""I'm training for that marathon, too!"") are quick ways to weaken a relationship. 5. Reframe your thinking during tough times. When a relationship hits a rough patch, it can be easy to think pessimistically. Thinking optimistically isn't about rainbows and unicorns, rather, it's about being realistic. Optimistic thinkers are able to identify solutions that haven't yet been tried (instead of trying the same thing over and over again that isn't working). In addition, optimistic thinkers zero in on what they can control, influence or leverage. One question I always ask myself during tough times is, ""Will I still be dealing with this problem in the next month or year?"" Odds are, the answer is no, and that gives me a little perspective.6. Have hope. When my ex-fiancé and I broke up years ago, three months before our wedding date, I was devastated. It was one of the times in my life where I felt truly lost and without hope. Whether you're dealing with a sick child, contemplating a divorce or break-up, or wondering how you're going to pay the bills, resilient couples have hope. The three elements of hope include having goals (identifying pathways); feeling empowered to shape your daily life (remember to zero in on where you have control, influence and leverage); and identifying multiple avenues toward making your goals happen. Hope has been shown to be a strong predictor of satisfaction, even being called a symptom of happiness. (3)7. Practice empathy. The ability to understand another person's experiences and emotions is a powerful relationship tool. In addition to promoting forgiveness, empathy is also a hallmark of resilience. Empathetic people tend to be less selfish, having a genuine interest in the well-being of others. (4) One of my favorite quotes is, ""One of the hardest parts of life is deciding whether to walk away or try harder."" There are many reasons to both stay in, and leave, a relationship. Choosing to stay requires resilience, and hopefully one of these seven strategies makes a difference in your relationship.Image via American Express TumblrReferences: (1) I developed the CARE acronym with my colleague, Lorrie Peniston.
