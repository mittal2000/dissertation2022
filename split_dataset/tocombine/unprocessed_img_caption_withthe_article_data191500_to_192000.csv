Every year on April 15, millions of Americans fret and file on National Income Tax Day, and hope, with fingers crossed, that after the numbers are crunched and the paperwork is in, a nice refund is headed their way. And because Uncle Sam doesn't wait for anyone, even brides in the midst of  planning are forced to take a break from calling their wedding planners to chat with their financial planner. This got us thinking... what are brides (in the middle of forking out money on what is for many is the most expensive day of their lives -- their wedding day) doing with their tax refund? Are they splurging on something for themselves, spending it on something practical, or taking it straight to the bank to save for a rainy day? We talked to thousands of brides across America, and here's what we found out about how they are using their tax refund and what it says about them. If you are a bride, leave a comment and let us know what you are doing with your tax refund! "

Unless you have plans for a very special evening, we recommend wearing something underneath the topper, but we digress. A trench coat is a must-have item in a woman's wardrobe, we feel. It's light enough for windy, rainy days and chic enough to throw over everything -- I love nothing more than dropping my kids off at school in a trench with my pajamas underneath. In this weather, I wear it with a light sweater and a scarf, and come fall, I'll add a few additional layers. The classic shape and cinched waist make for a beautiful silhouette; add oversized sunglasses and you're channeling Jackie O. Here, our favorite trench coats, and the celebrities that look effortlessly stylish in them.Meanwhile, would you wear a trench coat as a dress like Victoria Beckham?Want more?
