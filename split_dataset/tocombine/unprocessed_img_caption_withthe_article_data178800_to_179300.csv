Petroleum Pump System Operators, Refinery Operators And Gaugers",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d1981f0000390123ad0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"From 24/7 Wall St.: Between 2010 and 2020, the United States is expected to add nearly 20 million new jobs. That represents a 14.3 percent increase in labor. A good part of that change has to do with population growth, as well as the growth of several sectors. Certain medical and personal care jobs will grow by 50 percent or more as the baby boomer population ages and their needs increase. Other occupations, however, will decline considerably.Read: America’s 10 Disappearing JobsChanges in population and technology also will lead to certain jobs shrinking dramatically or even becoming obsolete — if they are not already. Using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) information on thousands of separate occupations, 24/7 Wall St. identified 10 job categories that will shrink by at least 14 percent, and in some cases by much more than that. These are America’s 10 disappearing jobs.No single occupation category is projected to lose more jobs than postal service workers. The evolution and increasing use of digital communication has taken a toll on delivered mail. As a result, the government has implemented planned cuts to the number of postal employees. As of 2010, there were approximately 524,000 USPS positions in the country. By 2020, the BLS expects that number will decline by nearly 140,000, or 28 percent.There will be more severe declines within certain postal occupations. Postal Service mail sorters, processors and processing machine operators increasingly are being replaced by more efficient mail sorting machines, and their numbers are projected to decline by more than 50 percent by 2020.A review of the remaining categories is a who’s who of job sectors that are increasingly becoming obsolete. Two of the 10 positions are in the declining print business. Three are in the textile repair or manufacturing industry, which continues to move jobs overseas.24/7 Wall St. looked at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Matrix on the projected growth or decline of more than 800 different occupations between 2010 and 2020. To avoid insignificant percentage changes, we excluded all jobs that had less than 10,000 positions as of 2010. We ranked all remaining positions by the projected decline of jobs by 2020 as a percentage of 2010 employment. For positions that were too similar, or fell into the same category, we included the broadest category. For example, postal service workers is a job category that includes several categories, many of which are expected to decline a great deal. In this case, we discussed postal service workers as a whole, mentioning occupations within the category that will lose the most jobs.These are America’s disappearing jobs, according to 24/7 Wall St.:"

But, as Israel increasingly weighs the option of a military strike, Western leaders wary of another Middle East conflict may have to pay closer attention to the claims.

But StanChart's about-face within days, from vigorously defending past deals with Iranian clients to handing over $340 million - 5 percent of its pretax profit - was illustrative of an industry-wide shift in mindset.""The acceleration in a sense is coming from (the banks') side defensively,"" said Michael Malloy, a professor at the University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law in California.""The notion being that it would be better to get out in front of this and confront the difficulty and come clean rather than wait for the authorities to ferret you out,"" said Malloy, who previously worked for the U.S. Treasury.Clearly, it is not something all boards will shout about; when another British bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, made mention of talks with regulators on U.S. sanctions regulations in its quarterly report last month, it took another two weeks before many investors became aware of the issue via the media.But, after Standard Chartered and June's record $619-million fine paid by Dutch bank ING, the list of European banks going public with warnings about possible U.S. payouts includes Germany's Commerzbank and HVB, a unit of Italy's Unicredit, as well as HSBC in Britain.And Chinese banks have become embroiled in the process too, with the New York Times reporting on Wednesday that prosecutors said they had found evidence in their investigations that they, too, may have flouted U.S. sanctions against Iran.By contrast, U.S. regulators long gave little opportunity to domestic banks to deal with Iran at all, leaving American bankers now little troubled by inquiries into past transactions. FINED SO FARIt has taken time to reach this point; since Britain's Lloyds TSB Bank Plc became the first to settle, forfeiting $350 million in January 2009 for masking the origin of payments to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran, Libya and Sudan between 2002 and 2007, others to pay penalties have included Credit Suisse, in December 2009, Barclays, in August 2010, and ABN Amro - now part of RBS.Yet, as disclosures by the regulator in the Standard Chartered case made clear, bank executives were discussing among themselves the risk of personal criminal liability as long ago as 2006, as they sought to maintain profitable business despite confusion over exactly what was permitted under U.S. sanctions rules which had last been substantially altered in 1997.Political heat over Iran's nuclear programme grew as Tehran defied U.N. resolutions in 2006 and denied Western accusations it was seeking atomic weaponry, but only in late 2008 did the U.S. Treasury ban a key element of non-U.S. banks' business with Iranians, known as ""U-turn"" transactions, by which they passed dollars for Iranian clients anonymously through the U.S. system.Since 2009, the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ), the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Manhattan District Attorney's office have clamped down on banks dealing with countries blacklisted by Washington.The sharp tightening of U.S. sanctions late last year, while not strictly relevant to past conduct, and the heightening of political drama over threats by Washington's ally Israel to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities also seems to have limited bankers' appetite for defending in public their dealings with Tehran, however strong many believe their legal cases would be.""It is a very intense area of focus,"" said Michael Zolandz, an attorney with law firm SNR Denton in Washington.""We're certainly sensing from large international banks ... that the pressure on them to disclose transactional information, to start sharing account data and monitor payments ... is definitely increasing."" ""PRICE OF DOING BUSINESS""The rules for U-turn transactions in particular have long been ambiguous at the least, legal experts say:""Even after recent settlements there remained a need to clarify how the sanctions regime would be interpreted and enforced, which underlines how much uncertainty there is,"" said Susannah Cogman, at London law firm Herbert Smith.But despite that lack of clarity over their previous business dealings with Iran, few Western banks now seem ready to put up much of a fight against the United States government.""To an extent this is the price of doing business in - and with - the U.S.,"" said Cogman, an expert on regulatory disputes.Showing an early willingness to cooperate could also help the banks limit the damage and avoid criminal charges.""There is also the very real possibility of criminal sanctions,"" said Malloy at the University of the Pacific. ""A showing of good faith and attempt to cooperate once you've been made aware of the problem would protect you in most cases.""Deutsche Bank in 2007 stopped taking on new business with counterparties in Iran, and, in a mark of the sensitivity to the risk to employees of U.S. legal action, a regulatory filing from March this year shows it did not involve any American citizen in either a managerial or operational role in Iranian transactions.Commerzbank warned last month it faced a financial hit to settle the U.S. probes into violations of sanctions on Iran and other countries, which could exceed provisions.Also last month, Italy's UniCredit said it was reviewing its German unit HVB to check ""historic compliance"", adding that the New York County District Attorney's Office, the DOJ and the OFAC were leading an investigation.French banks BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole are conducting inquiries into U.S. dollar payments to check whether they are in breach of U.S. sanctions, they said late in August.And Intesa Sanpaolo is still subject to an assessment by the OFAC, which could lead to administrative sanctions, half-year financial statements show. It has no further information on the timing or the size of any possible fine."

(AP Photo/Mel C. Evans)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6afc8240000510056d70a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Peter Bodo, Tennis.com  NEW YORK -- For all practical purposes the match was over, although you could almost have made that observation at any stage of Novak Djokovic’s 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 third-round win over Julien Benneteau.  Still, that seventh game of the final set, which Benneteau served while he still theoretically had a chance to get back into the match, was instructive as well as somewhat representative of Djokovic at his best -- and Benneteau at his most vulnerable.  On the first point, Benneteau was getting the better of Djokovic in an exchange up at the net, but he just wasn’t quick enough to control the lob he tried to hit deep to the backcourt with Nole’s nose hanging over the net. The ball went well wide, 0-15.  Djokovic then stepped in and powdered Benneteau’s next serve with a mighty backhand, driving the ball cross-court for a service return winner. 0-30.  Next, Benneteau hit an excellent, penetrating, wide second serve, the kind that can almost be too good—because when the target is an exceptional returner like Djokovic, there’s always the chance that he’ll take a quick cut and drive a bullet into the open court, down the line to a righty’s backhand corner. Sure enough, Djokovic got his racquet way out in front, and in the blink of an eye he had the down-the-line winner to Benneteau’s backhand side. 0-40.  At triple break point, a virtual match point, Benneteau managed to initiate a rally. Djokovic leaned into his down-the-line backhand to pull Benneteau way off the court, then went back the other way, to the backhand corner. Benneteau was hard pressed to reach the ball, but just didn’t have the explosive step or the speed, and he hit a late, feeble slice into the net to end the game.  The game not only showcased Djokovic at his most deadly, direction-changing, aggressive best, it also demonstrated why a guy like Benneteau has so little real chance against the second-seeded player and defending U.S. Open champion. Benneteau has a big serve, and when he plants his feet he can get some pace as well as action on the ball, but the 30 year-old world No. 35 is just too slow, too heavy of foot, and too unwilling to attack to cause Djokovic much anxiety.  The cushion Djokovic created for himself in each set undoubtedly helped him swing freely. Nole was up a break and pulling away at 4-2 in the first set. He broke Benneteau to start the second. He won Benneteau’s serve to go up 3-2 in the third, and added the unnecessary insurance break two games later.  The stats confirm the theory that you couldn’t invent an opponent who matches up so badly with Djokovic. Benneteau had a feeble 15 winners (a testament to Djokovic’s foot speed and anticipation) while Djokovic hit 41 (a tribute to Djokovic’s sledgehammer groundstrokes, for sure, but also a comment on Benneteau’s lack of speed and defensive abilities). As well, Djokovic kept his unforced errors down to 12, while Benneteau hit nearly twice as many (22).  The most damaging stat, though, was Benneteau’s inability to arrive at even one break point, never mind convert it into a break. And it isn’t like Djokovic had a banner day at the service notch. He put just 59 percent of his first serves into play, but Benneteau put just 65 percent of his service returns into play.  So that’s the anatomy of a non-upset. There’s no use beating this dead horse, but it’s interesting to note that Djokovic’s next opponent will be either No. 18 seed Stanislas Wawrinka (a player similar to Benneteau, but somewhat better), or No. 14 seed Alexandr Dolgopolov. The latter is fleet and fearless, and likely to raise more interesting questions than would Wawrinka. "

The inscription on the statue called ""the sick child"" reads: In Remembrance of the Dead and Living of the Contergan disaster. The drug is a powerful sedative and was sold under the brand name Contergan in Germany. The German manufacturer of a notorious drug that caused thousands of babies to be born with shortened arms and legs, or no limbs at all, issued its first ever apology Friday - 50 years after pulling the drug off the market. Gruenenthal Group's chief executive said the company wanted to apologize to mothers who took the drug during the 1950s and 1960s and to their children who suffered congenital birth defects as a result. ""We ask for forgiveness that for nearly 50 years we didn't find a way of reaching out to you from human being to human being,"" said Harald Stock. ""We ask that you regard our long silence as a sign of the shock that your fate caused in us.""

About 10,000 babies were born around the world with defects caused by the drug, mostly malformed limbs or missing arms or legs.""Having tried to remind them of their criminal behaviour across a negotiating table on several occasions, I didn't think this company would ever make things right,"" said British thalidomide victim Geoff Adams-Spink.""This is an important first step. The next is to compensate everyone damaged by their so-called 'totally harmless' drug,"" said Adams-Spink, who heads the European Dysmelia Reference Information Centre, a support group for those with limb malformations attributable to thalidomide and other causes.Gruenenthal, which says it had paid roughly 500 million euros to victims by 2010, unveiled a commemorative statue on Friday. At the ceremony, its chief executive, Harald Stock, said the company was sorry for what had happened to the victims.""In the name of Gruenenthal ... I want to take this opportunity to express our deep regret over the consequences of Contergan and our deep sympathy for the victims, their mothers and families,"" Stock said at the ceremony in the western German city of Stolberg, where the company is based. ""SILENT SHOCK""""We also ask for forgiveness for not reaching out to you from human to human for almost 50 years ... We ask that you see our long speechlessness as a sign of the silent shock that your fate has caused us.""Several thousand victims of thalidomide, sold in Germany under the brand name Contergan and elsewhere as Distaval, are still alive.Gruenenthal was not reachable for comment and it was not clear whether the 500 million euros in payments had been to victims in Germany only or also abroad, where other firms marketed the drug.German thalidomide victims get a monthly pension of up to 1,116 euros from a trust to which Gruenenthal contributes.An Australian woman whose daughter won a multi-million dollar settlement in July against Diageo Plc, the legal successor to thalidomide's Australian distributor, said the apology was an insult.""It's the sort of apology you give when you're not really sorry,"" Wendy Rowe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Lynette Rowe, now 50, was born without arms or legs after her mother took thalidomide for a month while pregnant. Her lawyers said Gruenenthal did not contribute to the settlement.Referring to Stock's statement of 'silent shock', Wendy Rowe said: ""Our family couldn't have gone into silent shock. We had to get up and face each day and every day and cope with the incredible damage that Gruenenthal drug did to Lyn and our family."" ""PATHETIC""The Rowe family's legal firm, Slater & Gordon, called the drug manufacturer's apology ""pathetic"": ""It is too little, too late and riddled with further deceit.""Rowe's settlement followed a A$50 million payment Diageo agreed to make in 2010 to 45 thalidomide victims in Australia and New Zealand, who sought help to cope with the mounting costs of care as they were living longer than expected.The cases have been closely watched in the United States, where a complaint has been filed against GlaxoSmithKline , Sanofi-Aventis, Avantor Performance Materials and Gruenenthal, with several plaintiffs claiming their birth defects resulted from their mothers' use of thalidomide.The thalidomide scandal triggered a worldwide overhaul of drug-testing regimes and boosted the reputation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which refused to approve the drug.Gruenenthal said it had acted to the best of its knowledge.""In developing Contergan, Gruenenthal acted according to the scientific knowledge back then and fulfilled all industrial standards for the testing of new medication,"" Stock said.Many German thalidomide victims stayed away from the unveiling of Gruenenthal's statue, which portrays a child with shortened arms, calling it a public relations stunt.""The fact that Gruenenthal, a billion-euro company, is paying 5,000 euros (for the statue) is a slap in the face of every victim,"" said the federal association of Contergan victims.""This PR measure is supposed to signal to the public that the company still has Contergan on its agenda, without any serious effort to address the concerns of the people who have been permanently damaged.""Harold Evans, Reuters editor at large who led a campaign for compensation of thalidomide victims as editor of Britain's Sunday Times from the late 1960s, said justice delayed was justice denied.""Fifty years of injustice is not to be assuaged by the most heartfelt apology, unaccompanied as it is by any compensation for the pain and suffering thousands of survivors endure every day,"" he said."

And that has meant that I have had to learn (and indulge) their individual shopping and storage styles, or what I lovingly refer to as their ""clothes crazies."" My 20-year-old son, for example, hates new clothes, both shopping for them and wearing them, so has whittled his wardrobe down to fives: 5 shirts, 5 t-shirts, 5 pairs of pants, 5 sweaters... you get it. You would think that this means a never-ending cycle of washing his clothes and stowing them away, but he is pretty oblivious to whether or not they are clean, and also doesn't believe in putting clothes away. Ever. He uses the Two Basket Method: one for clean and the other for dirty. Things move easily between the baskets, so I am never quite sure which is which. And he has added an ingenious spin: the bean bag chair, where clothes live when they are not quite dirty enough to wash, but not clean enough to wear. My daughter, on the other hand, shops a lot, and never throws anything away. She has sweaters from her childhood, some of which strangely still fit her grown-up frame. She stores her clothes as if she was stocking a store, à la Benetton, in blocks of colors. Her closet is a rainbow from black to white, with every shade in between. She once confessed that she has kept certain items that she never plans to wear again, just because they fit nicely in the color wheel. She has one walk-in closet, two dressers, one closet for coats and another for accessories. All full. And she doesn't even live here anymore. Putting her clothes away can be very stressful. I often mistake dresses for shirts, and where does a black and white checkered blouse with pink and blue flowers belong? With the pinks? Blues? Blacks or whites? She does not have a miscellaneous category to make it easier for an amateur.My husband Bob is also an avid shopper as he has several different personas, all of whom must be garbed. His multiple clothing personalities are not compatible and live separately. His work clothes: suits, ties and white shirts, hang in his office closet. His everyday fun clothes are in our bedroom. His fat clothes live in my office closet -- they rarely come out and it is better for all of us if they remain unseen and undiscussed. Rock and roll Bob's t-shirt collection, dating back to the '70s, lives in the attic where they can make noise, smoke and not bother the other clothes. Sport clothes (golf and soccer shirts which are only worn for important matches, because it really helps his team to win) are in the downstairs hall closet. Shoes are scattered throughout the house. Various costumes collected from heaven knows where: a Hugh Hefner smoking jacket, boxing robe, bowler hat, doorman jacket, and traffic policeman raincoat.In the interest of fairness, I will admit to my own minor clothes crazy: I hate to throw things away. My closet contains several pairs of jeans that are at least 20 years old, a pair of sneakers my son outgrew 10 years ago, a jacket I remember buying when I was 14 and trying to be cool, and a box of socks that have not seen their partners in years. I also have several outfits for ""gardening"" (I don't garden), pointy high heels that I bought in another life and eleven sweaters that even I admit are too ugly to wear in public. The nice thing about clothes crazies is that they are private, at least until you blog about them. And, as a family, we can get dressed for Halloween in under a minute.   Want more?

An easy toss? Anything beyond repair. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b6e063c00004c00096415.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Somehow, by default, I became the queen of laundry for my family. And that has meant that I have had to learn (and indulge) their individual shopping and storage styles, or what I lovingly refer to as their ""clothes crazies."" My 20-year-old son, for example, hates new clothes, both shopping for them and wearing them, so has whittled his wardrobe down to fives: 5 shirts, 5 t-shirts, 5 pairs of pants, 5 sweaters... you get it. You would think that this means a never-ending cycle of washing his clothes and stowing them away, but he is pretty oblivious to whether or not they are clean, and also doesn't believe in putting clothes away. Ever. He uses the Two Basket Method: one for clean and the other for dirty. Things move easily between the baskets, so I am never quite sure which is which. And he has added an ingenious spin: the bean bag chair, where clothes live when they are not quite dirty enough to wash, but not clean enough to wear. My daughter, on the other hand, shops a lot, and never throws anything away. She has sweaters from her childhood, some of which strangely still fit her grown-up frame. She stores her clothes as if she was stocking a store, à la Benetton, in blocks of colors. Her closet is a rainbow from black to white, with every shade in between. She once confessed that she has kept certain items that she never plans to wear again, just because they fit nicely in the color wheel. She has one walk-in closet, two dressers, one closet for coats and another for accessories. All full. And she doesn't even live here anymore. Putting her clothes away can be very stressful. I often mistake dresses for shirts, and where does a black and white checkered blouse with pink and blue flowers belong? With the pinks? Blues? Blacks or whites? She does not have a miscellaneous category to make it easier for an amateur.My husband Bob is also an avid shopper as he has several different personas, all of whom must be garbed. His multiple clothing personalities are not compatible and live separately. His work clothes: suits, ties and white shirts, hang in his office closet. His everyday fun clothes are in our bedroom. His fat clothes live in my office closet -- they rarely come out and it is better for all of us if they remain unseen and undiscussed. Rock and roll Bob's t-shirt collection, dating back to the '70s, lives in the attic where they can make noise, smoke and not bother the other clothes. Sport clothes (golf and soccer shirts which are only worn for important matches, because it really helps his team to win) are in the downstairs hall closet. Shoes are scattered throughout the house. Various costumes collected from heaven knows where: a Hugh Hefner smoking jacket, boxing robe, bowler hat, doorman jacket, and traffic policeman raincoat.In the interest of fairness, I will admit to my own minor clothes crazy: I hate to throw things away. My closet contains several pairs of jeans that are at least 20 years old, a pair of sneakers my son outgrew 10 years ago, a jacket I remember buying when I was 14 and trying to be cool, and a box of socks that have not seen their partners in years. I also have several outfits for ""gardening"" (I don't garden), pointy high heels that I bought in another life and eleven sweaters that even I admit are too ugly to wear in public. The nice thing about clothes crazies is that they are private, at least until you blog about them. And, as a family, we can get dressed for Halloween in under a minute.   Want more?

A suite is a hotel's first-class seat, often the most desired room and the epitome of hospitality done right. Be it palatial or cozy, high-design or low-key, it offers a place to eat, sleep, dress, entertain, observe or just plain lounge. The overall effect can be irresistible.Many hotels have taken their suite offerings to (literally) new heights. London's Corinthia Hotel, for instance, houses the 5,000-square-foot Royal Penthouse, which contains its own spa-treatment pod and a striking spiral staircase (among other luxe touches) and is the largest two-bedroom hotel residence in that city. The chic Arts Suite at the design-driven Hotel Arts Barcelona offers guests special extras, such as helicopter transport to lunch at one of Spain's Michelin-starred restaurants, or electric Smart cars to drive around town.While size is often a major selling point, it isn't the only measure of success. Taking cues from the outside environment can turn an already spectacular setting into something extraordinary. The Girijaala Suite at Amangiri in Canyon Point, Utah, takes full advantage of its superb desert locale, incorporating natural elements into its design and maximizing views of the Entrada Sandstone mesas. And in Marrakech, the Atlas Deluxe Suite at Selman is perched on 15 acres of parkland and offers unprecedented views of the Atlas Mountains, as well as the hotel's 16 Arabian horses.Award-winning actress Vivien Leigh once said, ""I need something truly beautiful to look at in hotel rooms."" These suites have beautiful views of all kinds covered, but they also create an experience that conforms to every need, making for a truly unforgettable stay.-- Ingrid Skjong See More on Departures: -10 Stunning Hotel Penthouses -Top Fashion Designer Hotels and Suites -Stunning Hotel Dining Room Views"
11,COMEDY,I Don't Give a Rat's Ass About the Republican National Convention,"Floyd Elliot, Contributor
But I digress...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/i-dont-give-a-rats-ass_us_5bad0663e4b04234e855eb5b,"Short of some kind of Hunger Games for presidential candidates, it's hard to imagine how to make the kind of coronation that the Republican convention represents, interesting.",2012-09-01,"Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, accompanied by his vice presidential running mate Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., speaks during a campaign stop, Friday, Aug. 31, 2012, in Lakeland, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad06631f0000df0022818b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I largely avoided watching the Republican National Convention. I'm much more than just okay with getting the highlights from online news: Ann Romney announcing her love for her husband and almost making us believe they're not both all clockwork inside, Chris Christie announcing his non-gay New Jersey Republican love for Bruce Springsteen and eating crates of Krispy Kreme doughnuts at a sitting, Mitt Romney announcing his love of corporations and firing people. Here's a little fact that the few journalists who still have jobs seem to find incomprehensible: ordinary people -- and I consider myself ordinary, despite my evil second head -- you wouldn't believe how my parallel parking has improved since that thing popped up -- simply don't care about the endless bloviation and marketing that goes on at these overblown spectacles. Even Hurricane Isaac, recognizing what a complete bore the RNC would be, swerved off toward New Orleans, where both people and dangerous weather masses go to party.Short of some kind of Hunger Games for presidential candidates, which would also save the American people vast amounts of money on primaries and make ""running for office"" both more literal and more amusing, it's hard to imagine how to make the kind of coronation that the Republican convention represents interesting. Sure, Ron Paul supporters ""revolted,"" as some media outlets put it, but not, sadly, because their party's platform made not one single lick of sense; no, their revolt concerned some kind of arcane delegate-related rule and had nothing to do with legalizing pot, so we at home rapidly lost interest. (Please explain what this revolt was about at great length in the comments. Because that will make it interesting.) Even the by-now requisite displays of Republican racism -- chanting ""USA! USA!"" when a Puerto Rican delegate stood up to speak, throwing nuts at an African-American camerawoman and calling her an animal -- haven't risen to the level of things that Romney has said in public. (Yes, sir, it is surprising that no one has asked a rich white dude about his birth certificate.) Come on, Republicans! Burn a witch on that platform! You know you want to...I'm sorry, but I can't even get all that excited about the irony of the ""We Built This!"" theme of the convention, meant as a rebuke to President Obama's half a gaffe, but actually proving the point he was trying to make, since 62% of the money to build the Tampa Bay Times Forum stadium came from the government. Oh, sure, that would be a lot of fun if Republicans had any shame left, never mind sensitivity to irony, but after doubling down on ""the voices in my head told me"" ideas like ""legitimate rape,"" non-man-made/nonexistent climate change and Obama cutting $700 billion from Medicare, never mind our center-right Bush-tax-cut-preserving President being a socialist, it's hard to imagine what could cause a Republican any shame at all. Conservative anti-gay activists being outed? Yawn. BTDT. What else you got? Racist appeals to whites? Right back at you with: ""Stop playing the race card!"" (Does the race card beat an ace? I forget.) ""We win, liberals! Because we will say literally anything! Poor people cause flatulence! Fertilized ova like soft rock! Wind power kills puppies! Ahahahahahaha!""So, I wonder if the incredible tedium of this convention isn't purposeful. Are the Republicans hoping that we won't be watching as they put on their light shows and drop their balloons and pretend to be excited that an all-grown-up Richie Rich is their nominee? As Mittward pretends to be a conservative, rather than just a guy who'll say or do anything to get elected, do the Republicans hope that sensible people continue to pay no attention? I suspect they fear that if we do watch -- and fat chance in my case, because I have 10 hours of the last season of Damages cued up to go on the Tivo -- we'll recognize their nominee for what he is, a coiffed Ken doll in an Armani suit, loaded up with stock phrases that appeal to the worst instincts of the worst people in this country."
12,QUEER VOICES,"'Anti-Bullying Policy Yardstick' From Focus On The Family May Contain Problematic, Anti-LGBT Language",Meredith Bennett-Smith,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-bullying-policy-yardstick-released-by-focus-on-family-controversial_us_5bafa9ece4b0ad76925fa979,"The Yardstick also admonishes educators from trying to address the motivation behind the bullying, as ""such an approach opens",2012-09-01,"This image shows the top half of the front page of The Sioux City Journal's Sunday, April 22, 2012, edition, featuring a full-page piece to an anti-bullying editorial after a gay teen committed suicide. The Sioux City Journal's front-page opinion piece calls on the community to be pro-active in stopping bullying and urges members to learn more about the problem by seeing the acclaimed new film, ""Bully,"" which documents the harassment of Sioux City middle school student. Relatives have said 14-year-old Kenneth Weishuhn Jr. suffered intense harassment, including threatening cellphone calls and nasty comments posted online, after coming out to family and friends about a month ago. He died April 15 from what the local sheriff's office described only as a ""self-inflicted injury.""

The document aims to help parents and teachers evaluate their anti-bullying policies and make sure the rights of all are protected. However, analysis by ThinkProgress concludes the Yardstick may feature ""an elaborate scheme to ensure religious bullying is protected in schools while students most likely to be targeted for harassment are made more vulnerable,"" namely, LGBT students.For its part, the legal team at the ADF has not hidden its belief that schools are often influenced into adopting policies that promote a gay-friendly agenda. These activist groups ""dupe schools into adopting policies that protect students based on their 'sexual orientation' or 'gender identity,' which can unconstitutionally silence students who want to express their biblically-based views on sexuality,"" ADF Legal Counsel Jeremy Tedesco told The Christian Post.Organized into the top 10 ""most common components of anti-bullying policies,"" the paper goes through the ""bad"" and ""good"" ways to address the various issues.In a section headlined, ""First Amendment Protection,"" the Yardstick warns that policies must include an exemption for ""religious, political, philosophical, or other protected student speech."" This is potentially problematic for LGBT-related bullying instances however, as anti-gay speech is often justified by religious beliefs. Focus on the Family has fought for similar religious exemption clauses in recent anti-bullying legislation, including the first draft of a Michigan bill (its clause was later removed after protests) and Tennessee's so-called ""license to bully"" law. The Yardstick also admonishes educators from trying to address the motivation behind the bullying, as ""such an approach opens the door to improper and unlawful attempts to 're-educate' students.""This may contradict an April survey conducted by the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) that concluded schools ""with an LGBT-inclusive curriculum is related to a less-hostile school experience for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) youth as well as increased feelings of belonging.""Schools should never require teachers to report bullying, the Yardstick continues, lest they ""over-report."" Policies should ignore anonymous complaints and instances of cyberbullying, and private schools should always be made exempt, the document continues. The Yardstick also devotes space to an issue that has long been a Focus on the Family rallying cry: the influence of the homosexual agenda. Visitors to group TrueTolerance.org's site are greeted by the question, ""Concerned about homosexual advocacy in your child’s school?"" The Colorado-based organization is known for fighting to keep LGBT-friendly language out of the classroom, as in the instance of an California school board that adopted an anti-bullying program which specifically mentioned gays and lesbians, ABC News reports.In keeping with this theme, the policy Yardstick warns parents and teachers that extending protections to certain ""favored students"" allows for ""the advancement of the political agenda of homosexual activist groups."" By the same token, policies that ""require instruction on bullying are problematic"" and often include ""materials promoting homosexual behavior.""Of course, it ultimately may be less an issue of political agenda and more a response to factual analysis. According to GLSEN,nine out of every 10 LGBT students have been harassed by their peers at school.  h/t ThinkProgress"

The Humane Treatment for Farm Workers Act (AB 2676) says that agricultural employers must treat farm workers at least as well as animals or face the same criminal penalties.,2012-09-01,"This photo from July 31, 2012 shows dried corn plants in Yutan, Neb. The latest U.S. Drought Monitor survey shows an increase in extreme drought conditions in four Plains states but a slight decrease in the overall area of the lower 48 states experiencing some form of drought. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb11fe92600003500817439.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2012 has been the hottest year on record -- ever. Millions of Americans suffered through the sweltering heat this summer, many in triple-digit temperatures in the Northeast and Southwest and California's central valley. California farmworkers are literally dying from the heat. And their deaths are entirely preventable. Four hundred thousand California farmworkers toil in extreme heat, producing 90 percent of the labor the multi-billion-dollar agriculture industry that helps feed the nation our tomatoes, strawberries, grapes, lettuce and much more. They often lack water and access to shade throughout the long day in the fields.Since 2005, at least 16 farm workers have died due to heat illness.In 2008, for example, there was Maria Isabel Jimenez, a 17-year-old girl who was pruning a vineyard for Merced Farm Labor, near Stockton. She worked in the fields for nine hours straight without any water and no shade. After working under such brutal conditions, she collapsed. After delayed medical treatment, she was taken to a hospital several hours later and had a body temperature of 108.4 degrees. Within two days, Maria had died.Her case highlights everything that is wrong. The farm labor contractor involved had been caught before not providing water and didn't even call 911. The lopsided criminal justice system convicted the contractor with manslaughter but then sentenced him to ""community service.""A bill is now on California governor Jerry Brown's desk that will end these brutal practices and save lives. The Humane Treatment for Farm Workers Act (AB 2676) says that agricultural employers must treat farm workers at least as well as animals or face the same criminal penalties. (California law makes it punishable as a misdemeanor or felony for every person who fails to provide any animal with proper food, drink, shelter or protection from the weather.)AB 2676 requires that farmworker must be given ""continuous, ready access"" to shade and enough ""suitably cool"" water for each employee to drink one quart per hour throughout their eight- to 10-hour work shift. Employers would be guilty of a misdemeanor subject to a six-month jail term and a fine of up to $10,000, increasing to one year in jail and a $25,000 fine if the worker victim suffers injury.The agriculture industry, predictably, is opposed to the new law. As always they claim that it's a ""job killer"" that would ""put farmers out of business."" They claimed that it would actually hurt farmworkers, since employers would send them home rather than risk fines. It's hard to believe that farmers would risk their crops when they could simply provide shade and water -- the humane and profitable thing to do. California grower complaints and predictions of economic disaster about common sense laws that protect farmworkers is nothing new.They've been ""crying wolf"" for years.Forty years ago, California's farmworkers were forced to stoop eight to 12 hours per day with short-handled hoes tending to lettuce and other crops. After only a few years in the fields, most workers suffered from chronic and debilitating back injuries.In 1972, the nonprofit California Rural Legal Assistance petitioned the Industrial Safety Board of the state Division of Industrial Safety (since replaced by the Cal-OSHA standards board) to prohibit the use of el cortito, as the short hoe was known in the fields. The California Rural Legal Assistance argued that farmworkers should be allowed to use a long-handled hoe to reduce back injuries.The growers predicted economic disaster. Lettuce growers were among the loudest opponents. Hector de la Vega, a lettuce grower from Calexico, testified in 1973 to the Industrial Safety Board that California would ""absolutely do away with the industry if the short-handled hoe was outlawed."" Another lettuce grower, Tom Merrill of Salinas, testified to the board in 1975 that the ban would result in reduced production, which would lead to a ""total loss of food crops of monumental proportions."" Attorneys for Salinas-based Bud Antle Inc., the largest lettuce grower in the world at the time, argued that banning the short-handled hoe would be disastrous, leading to fewer crops and higher prices.In 1975, the safety board rejected a ban on el cortito, but California Rural Legal Assistance appealed the decision. The state Supreme Court subsequently ruled against the agribusiness lobby. Soon after Jerry Brown become governor (the first time), the state Division of Industrial Safety banned the short-handled hoe.The growers' dire predictions proved wrong.Today, California's $30 billion agriculture industry is the world's fifth-largest supplier of food and agricultural commodities. Lettuce production and revenue have steadily increased since 1975, when the hoe was banned. As of 2010, more than three-quarters of all U.S.-grown lettuce is produced in California. And the number of agricultural workers in California has steadily increased since the ban.Even growers admitted they were wrong. Robert Antle, president of Bud Antle, told the San Francisco Chronicle in April 1975, ""We fought this thing and worried about it and now it turns out not to be a problem.""The governor, who created the groundbreaking Agriculture Labor Relations Board in 1975 during his first stint as governor, has a long history of protecting farmworkers. He should sign AB 7626 that will advance the ALRA's mission to ""guarantee justice for all agricultural workers"" and save lives."

The storm's center was on track to cross Arkansas on Friday and southern Missouri on Friday night, spreading rain as it goes. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb11fbc260000cf0081742f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Isaac battered the Gulf Coast, the Republicans -- vehement deniers of global warming --shared their big stage with a hurricane. While the party faithful boasted about how they will take over the White House and change everything in Washington, D.C., nobody was talking about what scientists tell us is inevitable: climate change. More monster storms, rising seas, sinking lands, shrinking arctic ice, environmental refugees, drought, water and food shortages, and other natural disasters are predicted. You'd think this future forecast would have at least deserved one speech, especially as the nearby Gulf Coast again suffers from a devastating storm. More than the economy, more than who is president, more than who is at war with whom, the effects of global warming will be a major ""decider"" of our future. Even the military takes climate change seriously as a real threat to our national and global security. And yet, climate change plans or even acknowledgement of its impact were nowhere on the agenda at this convention. Science seems to have little place in convention platforms. Nor do the 13-15,000 reporters covering this hoopla ever seem to make any real connection to the indisputable evidence of climate change as Hurricane Isaac's ravages tick away at the bottom of the CNN screen and they broadcasted the convention.This is an eerie disconnect. What's even stranger is that as the lights go out in New Orleans and Republican bright lights, such as Anne Romney and Governor Chris Christie took the stage, the hurricane images at the bottom of the CNN screen suddenly disappear. Like magic. As an entire Gulf Coast loses power, Republicans claim their presumptive power. The symbolism of this visual suggests: When humans speak, the hurricane disappears. And yet, at the end of Romney and Christie's speeches there's that pesky hurricane image again with its angry, swirling red eye. It pops back up on the bottom of the CNN screen with another disastrous headline.And now, a levee breaks near New Orleans echoing Katrina, and thousands struggle to weather this dangerous storm -- while the Republican Party plays on with its scripted story.What more evidence do we need that the Republicans are living in the past than the fact that no speaker has dared face the disturbing weather predictions for our global future? Instead, they're focused on ""legitimate rape"" delusions, forbidding women contraceptives, ""drill, baby, drill"" energy plans, keeping tax cuts for the wealthy, gutting Medicare, and denying diversity.  The only time Republicans talk about the massive shifts in our climate is when its Religious Right speaks about the tribulations of End Times. The Religious Right reference a book written when there was no such thing as global warming and humans barely left a footprint on the Earth. Michele Bachmann, repenting of an earlier speech last year linking Hurricane Irene and an East Coast earthquake to politicians not heeding God's warnings now simply calls this storm, a ""spiritual hurricane."" Code words to true believers without the political damage control.This tendency to talk about God and natural disasters, more than any scientific reckoning with our watery planet, made me wonder about the Mormon interpretation of hurricanes. This would-be president would be governing with that Mormon faith firmly in his heart. His world view and his decisions will be grounded in that bedrock. The Bible has its whirlwinds when God speaks to the chosen. What does the Book of Mormon say about these big winds? According to Hurricanes in the Book of Mormon, published by the ancient America Foundation (AAF), Mormon scholars claim that their good book ""may contain the first known historic references to hurricanes in America."" It explains ""In past times, some destructive storms were considered to be judgments of God when people needed to repent."" Might Republicans, so near the eye of this terrible storm, repent a little and take a practical and clear-eyed look outside the thundering applause in their own convention hall to face our environmental future? Not as politicians, but as people who also want to safeguard their next generations?To only address climate calamities based on religious interpretations instead of scientific data, is to doom us to being woefully unprepared to survive as a species. It's like reading a man-made story while the real hurricane huffs and puss and blows our house down. How about balancing all the religious rhetoric about End Times with the current issue of the National Geographic, ""What's Up with the Weather?"" How about opening the window in that convention hall and looking outside? How about addressing Hurricane Isaac's ominous updates at the bottom of the screen during speeches? Talk about ""spin."" A spinning hurricane should be the ultimate conversation and convention changer. The RNC is one of the world's largest gatherings. This was a chance for Republicans to face toward the future and not the past. To reckon with the 7,000 people in Louisiana's storm shelters; those whose homes are floating away; those who expect all our politicians to care about our collective survival. Watching the RNC offered so many unintended ironies: Condoleezza Rice talking happily about being one of the first women being granted membership in the traditionally male and at one-time whites-only Augusta Golf club; while the ticker of the Hurricane news underneath reports:"" 7,000 in Louisiana without power."" It's enough to force us to ask philosophical questions like: What is real power? Who can really gimme shelter?We do not stop a storm by ignoring it. Nature's power is bigger than politics, more persuasive than all our powers of denial. It's the main event and it can blow down the Big Tent.Brenda Peterson is the author of 17 books, including the recent memoir I Want To Be Left Behind: Finding Rapture Here on Earth, named by The Christian Science Monitor among ""Top Ten Best Non-Fiction Books of the Year.

Instead, the SEC alleged, they encouraged their colleagues to use the incomplete offering documents to help sell the CDs.In a statement, Green's lawyers, John Kincade and George Freeman, said that Green had no knowledge of the fraud.""We look forward to the opportunity to clear Mr. Green's name, and we are confident we will succeed,"" they said.Lawyers for Bogar and Young did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.Allen Stanford was sentenced in June to 110 years in prison for bilking investors with fraudulent CDs by Stanford International Bank, his bank in Antigua.Separately, on Friday the SEC settled allegations of securities fraud against Jay Comeaux, who managed the brokerage's Houston branch office, according to a filing that instituted administrative proceedings against him.Comeaux, who settled the case without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, faces a bar from the industry, and may face penalties that have not yet been determined, the SEC saidComeaux was responsible for supervising the brokerage's financial consultants, and received commissions of at least $1.3 million on the sales of fraudulent CDs, the SEC said.According to the SEC, Comeaux knew that the bank wouldn't disclose details of its investment holdings, but still used marketing material that told investors that the bank maintained a ""well-diversified portfolio of highly marketable securities.""A lawyer for Comeaux did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Riley of Little Rock, Ark., became unemployed for the first time in two decades, he ventured into the Great Online. ""Once I found out I was going to be laid off in April of last year, I realized how much job-hunting had changed in 20 years,"" Riley said. ""The big advantage now is that in order to give people the opportunity to see my work ... I'm able now to put all that stuff online.""Riley, a 54-year-old marketing expert, created accounts on LinkedIn and YouTube, where he uploaded commercial spots he's created for educational institutions, grocery stores and political candidates.""I had an interview yesterday and the interviewer had already taken a look at my portfolio, based on the links I'd put up,"" Riley said. ""So that was a big improvement over what it was like 20 years ago. [Back then] I either had to open up a big notebook or ask, 'Have you got a VCR?'""Riley's doing what job counselors (and even the government) tell unemployed people to do: Get online. It's a phenomenon LinkedIn cofounder Allen Blue said will revolutionize the economy and empower jobseekers. ""The world of employment, the world of how the economy functions, is undergoing radical change right now because of big data,"" Blue said in an interview at The Huffington Post's ""What Is Working"" jobs expo in Tampa, Fla. (More than two dozen companies and nonprofits have partnered with HuffPost to search for ways to reduce unemployment. LinkedIn is pitching in with an online forum and data on job openings.) ""Within a few years there’s going to be tremendous perception of what’s actually happening at all levels of the economy and we’ll actually be able to see it clearly, really, for the first time in history,"" Blue said. ""The great thing about it is that that power’s actually going to be in the hands of the individual job seeker."" The power is also in the hands of businesses, Blue said. ""Every single employer out there is like, 'Thank god for LinkedIn and Facebook. I know so much about the people I'm hiring.'""More than 5 million Americans have been unemployed at least six months, and studies have shown even a short period of joblessness makes job seekers less attractive to potential employers. HuffPost asked Blue if all that knowledge about job candidates can be a disadvantage for those with gaps on their resumes.  ""I'm told it can,"" he said, ""but the ability for me to find information about them –- see what they’re interested in, see what they care about, see who they hang out with, see what kinds of things they’re learning, skills they've acquired ... We’re putting a huge effort right now into collecting skill information.""""That's on your LinkedIn profile. You’re now out there in front of lots of people who could discover you through that path. Every new piece of information you stick on that profile is a new path to finding you."" While he's joined LinkedIn and is connected as much as possible via social media, Mark Riley is also planning self-promotion of a more old-fashioned variety. He's drafted several versions of a ""Hire me!"" advertisement to put on billboards around town, as soon as he can find a way to pay for it. The ads show Riley's smiling face and direct people to his LinkedIn page.""My father was the general manager of Donrey Outdoor in Little Rock for many years,"" Riley said in an email. ""Billboards put food on the table and put me through college, so I believe in them as an effective advertising medium."""
