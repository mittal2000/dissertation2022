0,BUSINESS,What Murphy Showed Me on Memorial Day that Every Producer Should Know,"Michael Goldberg, ContributorAuthor, speaker, sales consultant, boxer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-murphy-showed-me-on-_b_7502974.html,"Like with anything, there's good and bad. Not all firms do a great job at inspiring and setting their producers up for success. Does yours?",2015-06-04,2015-06-03-1433344870-2565034-howtoachievegoalsnavyseals.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-03-1433344870-2565034-howtoachievegoalsnavyseals-thumb.jpg,"On Memorial Day, I did a workout called ""The Murph"" at my Crossfit gym (or ""box"" as it's called in the world of Crossfit). It's a killer workout that commemorates Lieutenant Michael Murphy, a Navy SEAL who died in Afghanistan in 2005. Murphy was awarded the Medal of Honor and the Purple Heart. Quite a story.Crossfit gyms worldwide honor Michael Murphy every year on Memorial Day by doing his favorite workout which consists of running a mile, doing 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats, and then running another mile (20-pound weight vest optional). This is the second year in a row that I completed the workout.Before the event, a former Navy officer and member of my gym did a talk about Michael Murphy to honor his heroics and explain the significance of the pain we were about to endure -- which of course doesn't compare to the sacrifice Murphy and so many others have made. There were quite a few people donning ""The Murph"" tee shirts as we all geared up for the start of the event. Participants ranged from elite athletes to those just looking to get in better shape. What I found inspiring (other than the obvious) was how the trainers (elite athletes themselves) made non-athletes that were participating feel. ""Do the best you can. The fact that you're here and a part of the event is appreciated and says plenty. We're here to cheer you on. Just do the best you can and remember why you're doing it.""Apache Crossfit (they all have different names) could not have done a better job at honoring those we lost while making me feel proud to be, not just a part of the event but, a part of Apache. I can tell you first hand that not all Crossfit gyms do a good job at making everyone feel included and important. It's similar at so many financial firms that I visit across the country. Like with anything, there's good and bad. Not all firms do a great job at inspiring and setting their producers up for success. Does yours? As a sales producer (financial advisor, broker, agent, rep, planner, other), take advantage of mentors, training, and other resources that are available to you. If they're not available to you, find your Apache firm that will set you up for success. But before you do, look in the mirror. If your sales managers are successful, are you listening to them? Are you making your calls? Setting up sales appointments? Networking? Getting involved in associations? Fundraisers? Your community? Do enough people know what you do? Are you setting yourself up for success?"

This is one patient's story. When baby squirrels fall out of their nests, they often land on their heads. Bloody noses are common injuries, as are broken teeth.But this little baby had an additional and very serious injury-- his left femur (the big bone in his upper leg) was broken into two completely separate pieces!The break may have happened in the fall from the tree, or perhaps the leg was broken when the squirrel was dropped by a crow.Dropped by a crow? Yes! When this baby's rescuer heard the sound of high-pitched screaming, she immediately ran outside to see what was going on. A crow had seen this baby and his sibling on the ground after their nest fell from its tree, and had taken advantage of easy prey. Luckily for the squirrel, the appearance of the homeowner startled the crow, which dropped the squirrel before he had been carried too far away. After everything he'd been through, this baby needed help, and fortunately his rescuer knew about WildCare.Upon intake at the Wildlife Hospital, the severity of this squirrel's injury was immediately obvious, even before radiographs were taken. The leg dangled behind him as he scooted across the exam table, and even with the naked eye Medical Staff could see the broken bone. Of course they immediately put the squirrel on pain medication, but despite his injury he was alert and interested in exploring his new surroundings, dragging his injured leg behind him as he moved about. Even his appetite was good! Once introduced to the substitute squirrel formula we feed our orphaned babies, he took to nursing with gusto. Baby animals heal incredibly quickly, and wild babies can recover from many of the most catastrophic-seeming injuries. In addition, WildCare Medical Staff can heal many injuries involving broken bones using wrapping and immobilization. But this break was different. It would be impossible to immobilize with conventional materials, and without surgical intervention, there was no way the leg would heal sufficiently to allow the squirrel the mobility, dexterity and strength he would require to be successful in the wild. Fortunately, WildCare met veterinary orthopedic specialist Dr. Jim Farese when his daughter attended summer nature camp, and he has volunteered his surgical skills for special cases such as this one. Dr. Farese generously volunteered to come to WildCare's Wildlife Hospital and perform a pinning surgery on this tiniest of patients.Dr. Farese set up his surgical suite in WildCare's cramped Medical Room (if you're wondering why WildCare is so excited about building our new facility, just imagine surgery in a room smaller than the average kitchen!) Dr. Farese likes to listen to music during surgeries, so, to the strains of Fleetwood Mac and other classic rock from his MP3 player, he prepared to operate. The surgery went well (you can watch it in the video below... please note: this is actual surgery footage) with WildCare Director of Animal Care, Melanie Piazza assisting and periodically checking the patient's heart and respiration. Once the incision was complete and the bone was revealed, Dr. Farese noted that the two pieces had already started to fuse together, but due to the severity of the displacement of the ends of the bone, he could see the beginning of a malunion (incorrect/abnormal fusing of bone). Fortunately surgery was happening before the malunion progressed further.Watching the surgeon manipulate, drill and pin a femur much smaller than his little finger gave WildCare staff and volunteers huge appreciation for Dr. Farese's skills. Two pins were inserted into the leg to completely stabilize the bone, and then the surgery site was sutured and the skin glued. Dr. Farese acknowledged that, although he had performed surgeries on kittens before, this was probably his smallest orthopedic patient.With surgery over, the rest was up to this little squirrel. To our great relief and satisfaction, he healed beautifully! It was only a few days post-surgery before he began using the injured leg, and Medical Staff watched with excitement as he gained full use of his ankles, feet and toes. A month later, and this squirrel has graduated to a large outdoor cage where he'll build strength and speed in preparation for release. In the second video below, you can see our little patient, now a gangly juvenile, deftly maneuvering up and down the wire walls of the cage and climbing adeptly with all four feet! Thanks to Dr. Farese and the team of WildCare volunteers that helped raise this orphaned squirrel, he has a second chance at life.WildCare is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization supported almost entirely by private donations and individual memberships.

Growing up as I did in a folk music community, she was a constant influence. Dulcimers, autoharps, banjos, guitars and voices rang with songs like ""The L&N Don't Stop Here Anymore"", ""Black Waters"", and ""My Dear Companion"" -- not to mention older ballads and play party songs -- Loving Hannah, The Cuckoo and Jubilee. Best of all was Jean's own singing -- gentle, unassuming and beautiful, with that clear, high voice that took you right to the hollers of Perry County, Kentucky. Jean Ritchie and George PickowI was in my thirties before I got to know Jean personally -- she and her husband George Pickow hosted a folk music picnic at their home in Manhasset, N.Y. We all sat down and sang together, and you've never heard the Long Island suburbs as quiet as it got in that yard when Jean sat down with her dulcimer and started playing ""Pretty Saro"". That was the day I learned about Jean's graciousness, generosity and humor. This is a woman whose music had given voice to the beauties and tragedies of Appalachian life and culture, who had influenced millions, who had played the Royal Albert Hall and Carnegie Hall, whose singing had helped shape American music, who could rock a baby to sleep in one breath and dress down the strip miners in the next -- and here she was, opening her home to all of us without a second thought. In typical form, she found a kind word for everyone who sang that day.We made music from afternoon to evening, and as shade began to spread over the yard, Jean sat in her garden and sang:My Lord, He said unto me, ""Do you like My garden so fair? You may live in this garden if you keep the grasses green And I'll return in the cool of the day.""I'd heard the song dozens of times, but I don't know that I'd ever really listened before. In that moment, its full impact hit me -- the beauty and imagery of Jean's words, echoing the biblical story of the Garden of Eden, but also Jean's very contemporary message of responsibility and covenant with earth, the divine and one another.You may live in this garden if you keep the waters clean. You may live in this garden if you will feed My lambs. You may live in this garden if you keep the people free.I got to know Jean and her family after that picnic, and she donated a song to an album I co-produced honoring her friend Utah Phillips. When she received her copy she wrote me a note expressing the hope that someday, someone might do something like that for her. A few months later, Jean suffered a stroke, and I began to wonder whether it might be time to make that CD. After George died Jean, now retired, mentioned to our friend Mick Lane that she worried her old music friends might forget her, and we knew the time had come. John McCutcheon, Kathy Mattea, Jon Pickow, Jean Ritchie, Mick Lane, Dan Schatz, Susie Glaze and Steve Rankin sing ""The Peace Round""  May 23, 2015, Berea, Kentucky (Photo by Don Cardwell. Used by permission.)By the time Mick, Charlie Pilzer and I started gathering artists to record Dear Jean: Artists Celebrate Jean Ritchie, Jean had returned to Kentucky, where she lived quietly and comfortably for the rest of her life. Recording her songs, every artist gave back to Jean some of the love and support she gave to all of us for so many years. It was as if, recognizing that Jean now walked in the cool of her own day, the music community she helped to create had come back to her garden to return some of the love, beauty and wisdom she put into the world. Jean died this past week, surrounded by family who sang by her bedside. Her last performance came at a concert in Kentucky just one year ago, when Susie Glaze, John McCutcheon and Kathy Mattea came to sing for Jean one more time at the Union Church in Berea. At the end of the evening, Jean, who had spent the entire evening singing along from her front row seat, turned around in her wheelchair and directed us all in The Peace Round. Then, with Jean's family gathered around her, the room stilled and then echoed with the beauty of the Ritchie family goodnight song, Twilight A-Stealing. Thinking on it now, it was a fitting close to a life of love and music.  The Ritchie Family with Dear Jean performers in Berea, Kentucky May 23, 2015 (Photo by The Jean Ritchie CD Project Trust.

Life deserves to be celebrated, and Jean Ritchie taught generations to celebrate life. The CD Dear Jean - Artists Celebrate Jean Ritchie supports the End Mountaintop Removal Campaign of Appalachian Voices. Jean's family have also requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be sent to Appalachian Voices."

Like tasting wine, proper coffee tasting is a detailed and specific process, starting with breaking the foam and inhaling the aroma of each. Then tasting, making sure your palette is neutralized (usually via aqua con gas). Super and fun and tasty! The plantation roasts their own coffee, picking (one by one by hand, seriously) just the best of the A-grade beans making a real great coffee. The Colombia beans are quite mild and sweet, not needing sugar or milk.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6747e2400005100984815.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Noz accelerates cars in the same way that energy drinks amp up our bodies. Our obsession with high octane energy has turned us into jittery cartoon characters, accelerating like the Road Runner with nowhere to go. We don't stroll; we spring. We don't rest; we crash.Yesterday, I saw a guy jump out of his car at a convenience store. He sprung out like a jack-in-the-box finally released. While his buddy pumped gas, he ran inside as if he were being chased by a bear. I kept an eye on him and moved toward the door for a quick escape. He went straight for the drink area and grabbed six energy drinks.He sprinted to the front counter before he realized there was a line. He tapped his foot and breathed heavily.Suddenly, he screamed something incoherent at his friend even though the doors were closed, sounding a lot like the Wookie in Star Wars. He put down his energy drinks and charged out the door.He returned and we all let him pay for his energy drinks, because God knows he needed them.He threw two bills on the counter and yelled, ""AND ADD $25.00 IN GAS!!"" as if he were Bob Goldthwait's grandson.Amped up people are everywhere. I observed the mannerisms of real junkies years ago in a tough community in California. I see similar mannerisms inside of Starbucks. People stroll in casually, but you can sense their need for speed. When someone takes too long to order their drink, customers behind them begin to twitch. They tap their feet and stare at the coffee cups for sale, trying to remain calm. And that's just my behavior.I rarely go in our Starbucks without observing at least three people in line. And, yes, my husband and I go every day. I'm a junkie, too.It amazes me that parents are dragging in their children and buying them caffeinated drinks. Why would you voluntarily get your kids all hyped up and hooked on six-dollar beverages? When my kids were little I supplied drugs like Benadryl, which was inexpensive and sleep-inducing.Once it is our turn in line, we smile. We joke around with the cashier, because she's got the goods. We stand and wait 10 minutes for a plastic cup filled with liquid, and yell out, ""THANK YOU!"" like the guy in the convenience store when it's delivered.We do a little dance, because we've been jonesing for a Mocha Frappuccino, and it's now in our grasp. I would love to video us junkies walking into a coffee shop, all slumped over and fussy, then juxtapose it to our walk after receiving our drug of choice. Suddenly, we are strutting like John Travolta in the first scene of Staying Alive.We are smiling. We have the syringe and it's got a straw.I watched the old ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" the other night and noticed the size of their coffee cups. Rob and Laura drank from shallow, delicate china cups that allowed about five ounces of coffee. The days of minimal black coffee are over. Now we add chocolate, caramel, whip cream, sprinkles and more caramel.We walk out with something that resembles what we used to get at Friendly's ice cream called ""the trough."" Once you finished, you got a button that said, ""I Made a Pig of Myself at Friendly's.""Perhaps Starbucks should start handing out those buttons. It worked for Friendly's. Might I say that as I write this, I spy an empty Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino cup to my left, a diet Mountain Dew bottle to my right, and a Starbucks Doubleshot energy drink on the desk behind me. I am one of them.The only difference is that I'm 54, and this amount of legal speed only gets me to a normal range of energy. Without it, I would be at home in bed, losing my job.But no excuses. I'm the person in line at Starbucks freaking out as the woman in front of me asks for a description of every food item offered before deciding on a plain bagel. I'm also the one who groans loud enough to embarrass my husband when the cashier tries to cross-sell something.Do the employees not know how dangerous it is to hold up a line filled with junkies? Obviously, hard drugs pose a bigger problem, but for fewer people. We now have thousands of very jittery, nervous people on our roads and in our schools and in our houses.Let's reconsider our caffeine addiction. Perhaps we take it a little more seriously.I say we do a 10-year study so that I can slowly wean myself from my Mocha Frappuccino Light. Otherwise, this could become a situation that is less ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" and more Dick Van Dyke starring in ""The Morning After."" Because I'm in love with my noz."

8,CRIME,How One California City Pays Its Most Violent Offenders To Stay Out Of Trouble,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richmond-california-anti-violence_n_7504554.html,,2015-06-04,"RICHMOND, CA - NOVEMBER 02: Students walk by Richmond, California police car that is parked in front of Richmond High School November 2, 2009 in Richmond, California. Faith leaders held a prayer vigil at Richmond High School to show support for a fifteen year-old student who was gang raped by several men while attending a homecoming dance. Six arrests have been made in the case. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c52c240000310095e961.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Baltimore, already in the national spotlight over the police killing of Freddie Gray, endured its deadliest month in almost 40 years, the search for solutions to the problem of persistent, violent crime turned again to a California city that was once among America's most dangerous.The Atlantic’s CityLab and The Washington Post this week reported on the city of Richmond's unusual approach to crime reduction.The initiative, part of the city's Office of Neighborhood Safety, identifies young male residents, aged 13 to 25, who are most at risk of killing or being killed. The San Francisco Bay Area city then pays them a monthly stipend, ranging from $300 to $1,000, over the course of 18 months in exchange for sticking with an individualized “life map” of positive behavior -- such as GED programs, anger management therapy and job training. The better they do, the more they are paid.Participants are also connected with community mentors, who are credible in part because many have their own violent pasts. The mentors keep in close contact with the young men throughout the program. But importantly, as Mother Jones noted in a 2014 story, the mentors do not share information about participants with law enforcement. Though the program has the police department's blessing, it operates independently.While partially funded by the city of 100,000-plus residents, the program is also not wholly dependent on the taxpayers. Private donors have stepped in to help pay for those financial incentives.The results of Richmond's initiative, which started almost eight years ago, have been encouraging. The Washington Post reports that of the 68 participants since 2010, 54 have not been charged with another gun-related crime -- and only four have died. Some of the participants have gone on to attend a four-year college. Additionally, the city’s murder rate has declined 77 percent in recent years, from 47 deaths in 2007 to 11 deaths last year.“It’s amazing,” DeVone Boggan, the program’s creator and director, told the Post, “and it has to do with focusing on those driving violence and recognizing that they have a great deal of power in terms of gun violence in our city and whether it goes up or down.”Other factors, of course, are at play in Richmond. As Al Jazeera noted, unemployment has declined and gentrification increased in cities across California, contributing to reductions in violent crime.Additionally, the Richmond police force has been credited with embracing community policing and reducing its use of deadly force since Chris Magnus became chief in 2006, as Yes! Magazine reported. A photo of Magnus holding a #BlackLivesMatter sign at a December protest went viral and made him a nationally recognized advocate for community policing.Could other cities copy Richmond's approach? One key difficulty lies in maintaining local support (a problem for Richmond, too). Funding may be abruptly cut when violence briefly reignites in a troubled neighborhood or when the political administration changes, which means that programs may not have time enough to succeed, CityLab reports. Chicago’s Cure Violence initiative, which also uses community mentoring and was featured in the 2011 documentary “The Interrupters,"" has seen its funding slashed this year.The Richmond program’s first formal evaluation is being conducted by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, a nonprofit social research group. Its results are set to be released later this month."
9,IMPACT,Study: Giving Homeless People Homes Is Cost-Efficient Even In Pricey Silicon Valley,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/housing-homeless-silicon-valley_n_7504564.html,,2015-06-04,"SAN FRANCISCO - SEPTEMBER 16: A homeless man holds a cup as he begs panhandles for spare change on September 16, 2010 in San Francisco, California. The U.S. poverty rate increased to a 14.3 percent in 2009, the highest level since 1994. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1daea1f0000df00236883.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even in a city with soaring rents, giving out free housing to homeless people is more cost efficient than leaving them on the streets.The median rent in San Francisco recently hit a whopping $4,225 a month. Still, despite the hike, a new study found that doling out apartments to homeless people in need can save the city a sizeable amount of money.The Economic Roundtable report analyzed six years of data of a homeless housing initiative in Santa Clara, taking into account each of the group’s varying financial needs. It found that members of one of the participating groups each cost the city an estimated $62,473. After those homeless people were given housing, that figure dropped to $19,767, a 68 percent decline annually. Some of those reductions related to a drop in emergency room visits, justice system encounters and drug and alcohol treatment. The study’s results are yet another boon for advocates who support the housing first model. That approach, first heralded by Greece-born psychologist Sam Tsemberis, supports first giving homeless people a roof over their head and then addressing their medical and employment needs. “People thought this was crazy,” Tsemberis told The Washington Post of how people reacted to his idea in the ‘90s. “They said, ‘You mean even when someone relapses and sells all the furniture you gave them … [to pay for] drugs, you don’t kick them out?’ And I said, ‘No, we do not.'” Starting in 2011, the Housing 1000 Permanent Supportive Housing –- in connection with the local government and nonprofit groups -- took in 496 homeless individuals in need. Altogether, 75 percent of participants remained in the housing program.Clients were provided with housing subsidy vouchers through the Housing Authority, but were required to contribute about 30 percent of their income to the monthly payments. They were also expected to do the basics: be decent neighbors and not damage their apartments. Nonprofit service providers offered housing placement and support services. That involved a comprehensive health, mental health and substance treatment program and building trusting and ongoing relationships with clients. The study concluded that retention rates could be further improved by strengthening post-housing support services.As the Obama administration gears up to end chronic homelessness by 2017, such studies continue to prove that housing first could be the key to effectively achieving that goal.A nonprofit out of Charlotte, for example, which provides permanent housing and other services to homeless people, has saved the city $2.4 million in medical costs alone since 2012, according to a recent report. Through its housing first program, Utah has reduced its chronic homeless population by 91 percent over the course of a decade, according to Deseret News. ""No other state is even close,"" Gordon Walker, director of the state Division of Community and Housing, told Deseret News. ""We've had no additional resources than [any other state] has had to do this, but by focusing, having a plan and having great collaboration with our partners, we've been able to see successes.""

It's a wonderful city. One of its highlights is a beautiful royal castle, built in the 16th century by an Italian architect. The castle had just one problem. It had no interior hallways. To go from room to room, you had to go outside onto a covered walkway overlooking a courtyard. This is a perfectly good idea in warm Italy, but in Poland it can get to 30 below in the winter!In evidence-based reform in education, we have a related problem. As proven programs become more important in policy and practice, many educators ask whether programs proven in one place (say, warm Florida) will work in another (say, cold Minnesota). In fact, many critics of evidence-based reform base their criticism on the idea that every school and every context is different, so it is impossible to have programs that can apply across all schools.Obviously, the best answer to this problem is to test promising programs in many places, until we can say either that they work across a broad range of circumstances or that there are key context-based limiting variables. While the evidence may not yet (or ever) be definitive, it is worthwhile to use common sense about what factors might limit generalizability and which are unlikely to do so. For example, for indoor activities such as teaching, hot and cold climates probably do not matter. Rural versus urban locations might matter a great deal for parent involvement programs or attendance programs or after school programs, where families' physical proximity to the school and transportation issues are likely to be important. English learners certainly need accommodations to their needs that other children may not. Other ethnic-group or social class differences may impact the applicability of particular programs in particular settings. But especially for classroom instructional approaches, it will most often be the case that kids are kids, schools are schools, and effective is effective. Programs that are effective with one broad set of schools and students are likely to be effective in other similar settings. Programs that work in urban Title I schools mainly teaching native English-speaking students in several locations are likely to be effective in similar settings nationally, and so on. Yet many educators, even those who believe in evidence, are willing to adopt proven programs, but then immediately want to change them, often in major ways. This is usually a very bad idea. The research field is full of examples of programs that consistently work when implemented as intended, but fail miserably when key elements are altered or completely left out. Unless there are major, clear reasons why changes must be made, it is best to implement programs as they were when they achieved their positive outcomes. Over time, as schools become familiar with a program, school leaders and teachers might discuss revisions with the program developer and implement sensible changes in line with the model's theory of action and evidence base.Faithful replication is important for obvious reasons, namely sticking as close as possible to the factors that made the original program effective. However, there is a less obvious reason that replications should be as true as possible to the original, at least in the first year or early years of implementation. The reason is because when educators complain about a new program ""taking away their creativity,"" they are often in fact looking for ways to keep doing what they have always done. And if educators do what they have always done, they will get what they have always gotten, as Einstein noted. Innovation within proven programs can be a good thing, when schools have fully embraced and thoroughly understand a given program and now can see where it can be improved or adapted to their circumstances. However, innovation too early in replication is likely to turn the best of innovations into mush.It is perfectly fair for school districts, schools and/or teachers to examine the evidence supporting a new approach to judge just how robust that evidence is: has the program proved itself across a reasonable range of school environments not radically unlike their own? But if the answer to that question is yes, then fidelity of implementation should be the guiding principle of adopting the new program.Kraków's castle should have had interior halls to adapt to the cold Polish winters. However, if everyone's untested ideas about palace design were thrown into the mix from the outset, the palace might never have stood up in the first place!"

In a now viral video, NBA star Stephen Curry holds his toddler daughter Riley on his lap during a press interview. His daughter then proceeds to steal the show. Throughout the video, she interrupts her dad, puts her face to the microphone, and walks slowly out of a curtain. All while her dad sits patiently.Some people are outraged, calling for new NBA policy to keep little kids out of the pressroom, while others see this as a glimpse of a real, loving dad, who happens to be one of the biggest basketball stars on the planet.You know what I thought about as I watched the video? I wish more people did this.We often get stuck like fish swimming in the waters of our lives. We do things to make ourselves look good, to be someone everyone thinks we should be, even at the cost of compromising who we really are. We don't know these things are holding us back, because we've let it become normal.But a rare few, like Stephen, change things. Here are six things you should start doing today, while you still can.1. Start Connecting  I have three little children at home and each one is special to me. But here's how it sometimes has gone when I've headed home from work...I get in the car: ""This is awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing my kids.""Halfway home: ""But I've really got to finish up that one project.""Almost home: ""Not sure how much time I'll have for them.""Opening door: ""Hey, daddy's home!""Before they go to bed: ""Let's read your favorite book together...""Me going to bed at night: ""That. Was. Awesome. I wish I could spend all my time with them.""They say that life is all about relationships. But our distracted brains don't agree. They want more texting, more email, and more ways to impress the boss. There's plenty of stuff out there to get in the way of life.Who matters most to you? What's holding you back from connecting with them? Remember why they're so important and let them be your motivation and part of accomplishing and celebrating your goals, and life will be more meaningful.2. Start Being Bold  Ever heard the saying, ""The bold will rule the future?"" Seriously, it's true. Sticking with what you believe means everything. Don't be too scared to start things nobody's ever done before because it appears impossible.Starting that new exercise approach is going to take more than average interest. And every day you put it off is another day you lose respect for yourself. By waiting to pursue your goals, especially those that make you healthier and happier, you become less of who you can be. Will that person in the mirror be any stronger if you don't do what it takes? Be bold.3. Start Sleeping More  When people brag to me about how little sleep they get and how much they can do without it, it makes me want to slam my head into a wall. You need to get plenty of sleep. There are very few exceptions to this, and most of us need seven or eight hours of renewing, health-restoring sleep.You are not so busy you can avoid sleep. That boss isn't forcing you to work midnight hours. And it's not worth waiting months or years to get carted off in an ambulance to discover the benefits of sleep you've been missing.4. Start Saying No  My friend Steve Toronto reminded me recently that anytime we're not willing to say no, we're saying yes to other things. So when you say yes to that night out, you're saying no to When you say no to less vital things, you gain power. That goes for saying no to everything from stupid TV shows to extra work that nobody even cares you're doing.5. Start Serving More  I talked to a friend recently who was looking for career advice. He told me he needed help getting into the right company doing what he enjoys. I asked him, ""Do they know how you'll best serve their needs?""Service is powerful, and always precedes success.6. Start Listening  Talk less, and give people the attention they crave. Be like Stephen Curry who's showing the world he listens to his adorable daughter, but also wants the world to know he listens to her. Start today making your life everything it can be, and the rewards will be there.  What above do you feel you could do more of? Would love to hear your thoughts.

I'm trying not to be a wreck and hope that lots of what I taught him these past 18 years will stick. I'm also hoping that lots of what he taught me will continue to resonate in his absence. For me, there is nothing more humbling and rewarding than learning from my kids. Whether they're regurgitating my own advice (which I tend to conveniently ignore) or imparting a fresh viewpoint, I pay attention and often end up apologizing. Is it their innocent perspective or natural growing pains that makes them wise? Maybe it's the lack of filter... Here are four life lessons I've learned (and am still working on) from my teenage son:1. It's easier and healthier to be positive than negative. When my son turned 12, I was fixated on teaching him to stick up for himself. One afternoon while coaching him on clever comebacks to combat lunch table politics and teasing, he let me know he's not interested in my unsolicited advice. ""I'd rather not spend so much negative energy trying to be someone I'm not. I'll be happier just walking away."" I was floored. Who walks away? And how did he know about positive and negative energy? He explained that at the end of the day he didn't feel any better by engaging negatively and that he'd rather focus on friends who made him happy. Okay then. Maybe it was a question of my own maturity, but since, I've tried to incorporate his philosophy into my adult life. Did I mention I'm still a work in progress?2. Be patient and give the benefit of the doubt. Recently my son came home and casually announced that due to a cheating scandal, the entire class could potentially receive a zero on their college level math exam. Recognizing that this was no time for coherence and rationale, I panicked and blurted, ""those cheaters are dishonest, unethical trouble-makers who just ruined it for the rest of you! I'm calling the school!"" My attempt to commiserate and frankly vent my unchecked frustration was met with his level-headed response: ""You're not calling anyone and you don't know that they're bad people. They made a bad choice. There's a difference. Let's just wait until the investigation is complete."" Why was he so cool, calm and collected?!In the end, it all worked out.Note to self: Next time control your urge to overprotect, micromanage and generalize before losing your sh*t. At least try.3. Take the high road.I'm just going to admit that this mantra is a tough one and took me about 40 years to start implementing. Luckily my son caught on at a younger age. After he learned how to stick up for himself with the best of them, he decided that sometimes not engaging is actually a show of restraint and virtue. He consciously decided that most times it's not worth it, and that holding back and picking your battles is more empowering than spouting off at the mouth. I've reached the same conclusion. It just took me a little longer.4. Turn your phone off.""Can you put your phone down and look at me?"" When your kids say this, you know you've got a problem. My partial excuse is that I'm checking work-related emails, but we all know that's crap. To hear your kid say, ""I know you're busy, but I'm trying to talk to you,"" is a wakeup call. Got it. Shamed into submission and hoping to never repeat that mistake again (probably repeated this mistake several times before this article went to print).There is nothing more humbling and rewarding than taking advice from your kids. Can I make myself feel better by taking credit for my son's intuitive words of wisdom? Maybe not. But I can be smart enough to pay attention. He's making good sense, so perhaps I'm not screwing up 100 percent of the time. Have your kids taught you valuable life lessons?"

After preparing chicken breasts on the stove (dry as toast), I compensated by adding a dipping sauce to mask it. My 15-year-old arrived at the table (starving) and began wolfing down his meal. A minute later, he stood up, turned pale, and began gasping for air. He was choking.Matthew managed to bring up some of the meat, but the rest remained lodged in the lower part of his throat. He could breathe and speak, but was frightened and uncomfortable. The 911 paramedics didn't take any action since he was able to breath and on-site treatment could make the situation more urgent. So Matt was transported to the local hospital ER.Now that my children are teens, our visits to the ER are less frequent. I had forgotten how crowded and busy these places are and that you (and your child) may be ear-to-ear with strangers who are ill, or in pain. It's a confusing place as an outsider and as a mother you sometimes feel anxious about waiting to see a doctor.From watching medical programs on TV, you might assume most ER patients arrive at the hospital in critical condition. In the real world, most ER cases are not life-threatening. I wanted to learn more about how the ER works ""from the inside."" I spoke with Dr. Jeremy Dayner, chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine and a board-certified emergency medicine physician at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold, New Jersey.""If you are ill or injured after regular office hours, call your primary doctor first. Most physicians have after-hours call services for emergencies. Since primary doctors knows your history, they can sometimes diagnose and treat your situation over the phone,"" says Dr. Dayner. ""If the condition is not life-threatening, also consider going to an urgent care center. They are usually open nights and weekends and these doctors specialize in emergency diagnoses and care."" Dr. Dayner adds that these centers can also usually treat you faster than an ER. If you need to go a hospital Emergency Department, Dr. Dayner offers these recommendations to help get the best care with the least amount of anxiety:Understand the goal of the Emergency Department Only about 12 percent of patients who come through the ER are admitted into the hospital. The goal of the ER team is to stabilize patients until they can see their regular doctor--cardiologist, pediatrician, OB/GYN or family physician. We don't establish long-term relationships with patients. If hospitalization is required, we will transfer your care to the attending physician who specializes in your medical condition. Bring one person with you but leave children with family or friends Bring only one advocate who can help answer questions, give updates to family, and assist as needed. Since most ERs are overcrowded, having multiple family members present compromises the privacy of all patients. The ER is no place to bring children; there is no one to care for them while you are being treated. If your condition is serious, don't drive yourself to the ER It's understandable that you'd want to get right to the hospital, but a distraught driver is not a safe driver. If there is any question about you or your family member's condition, call an ambulance. Paramedics can begin many types of emergency treatment even before you get to the hospital.We help the sickest patients first You will be triaged based upon the severity of your condition and you can't shortcut the line in the ER. Critically ill patients are treated first. We need to know all the medications you are taking Your health history is the most important tool the ER physician has to help make the safest and most accurate diagnosis. Our persistence in getting an accurate list of your medications, even if you just need a finger sutured, is to make sure we don't give you a drug that will negatively interact with what you are already taking. Federal regulations mandate documenting every patient's prescription and non-prescription medication. Carry a credit card-sized list of medications, including vitamins, and any medical problems you have.Be honest about your lifestyle If you smoke, use drugs or drink heavily, we need to know in order to devise a safe and effective treatment plan. We are here to stabilize your medical situation, not judge you. If you are in any kind of dangerous or abusive situation, tell us. We have the resources to help.This is not the place for ongoing treatment of your chronic medical condition Unless your chronic condition has a life-threatening complication, the ER is not the place to seek care. We don't know your full medical history or the treatment protocol your regular doctor has in place. As a result, we are not able to adjust prescription medications or prescribe new medications, unless it is to treat a condition unrelated to your chronic disease.Read the printed follow-up report our nurses give you  Healthcare is confusing. Patients are often not aware of the specific condition for which they were treated. Once you're home, sit down and read the report we prepared for you. It will state specifically what you need to do next to continue your recovery: prescriptions to fill, medical clearances for returning to work or school, and follow-up visits with a treatment provider. Contact the Medical Records Department for a copy of lab tests and a treatment record  Your ER visit and treatment protocol is important information to give to your regular physician. Most hospitals do not automatically forward this information without your consent or request.When you need to call 911 If you have any of these life-threatening symptoms, call an ambulance:• Chest pain or other signs of a heart attack • Stroke symptoms • Difficulty breathing • Severe bleeding • Head trauma or seizures • Drug or alcohol overdose • Severe pain  • Loss of consciousness • Sudden loss of vision or blurred vision • Compound bone fractures that break through the skinCalling 911 will provide professional medical assistance in the fastest way possible. These specially-trained paramedics will stabilize you and help keep your condition from worsening during transport to the hospital. They will also alert the Emergency Department to your medical emergency so that a team is ready to help you the minute you arrive at the hospital.""If you are faced with a visit to the ER, understand providing first-rate care is going to take time due to the ever-increasing volume of patients we are treating,"" Dayner explains. ""But emergency medicine professionals are also specially trained to diagnose and treat a wide spectrum of healthcare issues quickly and effectively. You're going to be in good hands."""

I recognize this, and I'm glad we have police. I feel much safer knowing that they are there.However, as we have seen in the many protests across the country in response to police shootings of unarmed black men, women, and boys, many people of color do not feel safe around police. They do not feel protected, they feel afraid, harassed, mistreated, in danger.The rally cry has become ""Black Lives Matter"" and in response, some have felt compelled to reply ""All Lives Matter."" The issue, however, is not that anyone is proposing that other people's lives do not matter. Of course everyone's lives matter -- including the lives of police officers. The Black Lives Matter slogan draws attention to the fact that, in our country, people of color -- and in particular black males -- are systematically treated as if their lives did not matter.As Christians we should recognize the language of black lives matter. After all, Jesus did not say ""blessed is everyone,"" but ""blessed are the poor"" (Luke 6:20). He did not say ""as you do it unto everyone, you do it unto me,"" but ""as you do it unto the least"" (Matthew 25:40). Jesus did not say ""love everyone,"" but ""love your enemies"" (Matthew 5:44). Continually Jesus drew our attention not to loving people ""in general"" but to specifically caring for those we would tend to discount or condemn. Black lives matter is exactly the kind of thing Jesus would say. Why did Jesus have this emphasis, and why should we? Because then as now, there are people who were marginalized, condemned, and shut out of the system, and the hallmark of Jesus' mission and ministry is all about drawing our attention to them. It has to do with empathy for the ""other,"" for the one we would normally regard the ""least.""This is not an issue peripheral to the gospel, or a matter of a few isolated proof texts. It is at the very heart of Jesus' ministry and mission. That's why it's so important that those of us who are part of the privileged class learn to listen to and to believe those in our society who are typically denied a voice when they tell us about their experiences of mistreatment. We need to hear when they tell us ""I can't breathe,"" both metaphorically and, all too often, literally.Noting that the cause of death in crucifixion is asphyxiation, Serene Jones, President of Union Theological Seminary, drives this point home for us poignantly when she states,  ""I can't breathe"" could very well have been uttered by Jesus on the cross--Jesus Christ, an oppressed minority under the most powerful government on the planet who was legally put to death by the state. But at least Jesus had a trial.That puts a new light on Christ's words, ""As you do it unto the least of these, my brothers, you do it unto me."" The way we treat people of color in our country is how we treat Jesus, who was himself a person of color. Looking at how Jesus told us to care for the poor, the least, and indeed how he told us to ""love our enemies,"" I am quite certain that he would also emphatically declare black lives matter. If we purport to be Christ's followers, just as we can say ""blessed are the poor"" even if we are not poor, we should likewise be able to say ""black lives matter"" even if we are not black. They matter, according the Jesus, because these are the very ones who are treated as the ""least"" in our country. They are the ones who are systematically criminalized, otherized, and marginalized. If we care about what Jesus cared about, then we need to care about this."

The Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea confirmed two deaths from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) on June 2, 2015. It reported six new cases of MERS, raising the number of confirmed local patients to 25. The first case was confirmed on May 20.

North Korea called for border checks.Seoul city officials said late on Thursday that they were asking 1,565 people who attended a May 30 meeting for a redevelopment project to undergo voluntary quarantine after learning that a doctor initially diagnosed with MERS on June 1 had attended the event in the wealthy Gangnam district.""We are taking actions ... to prevent spread of the disease. But I don't think citizens should be excessively fearful,"" Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon told a news conference just before midnight.About 1,600 people have been quarantined in South Korea, most at home but some in medical institutions.South Korean President Park Geun-hye has demanded everything be done to halt the outbreak, which began two weeks ago, brought into the country by a South Korean man returning from a business trip to the Middle East.MERS first appeared in 2012 in the Middle East, where most of the 442 fatalities have been.Among the five other new South Korean cases reported on Thursday were two health workers who treated infected patients.""We are in a war,"" said an official at a health centre in Gangnam, where panic spread when medical workers in protection suits were spotted near a hotel.The official said a Middle Eastern guest at the hotel fell ill and was later quarantined in hospital.MERS is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as that which caused SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which emerged in 2002-2003 and killed around 800 people worldwide.MERS has a much higher death rate, of 38 percent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), but also spreads far less swiftly than SARS from person to person, making it less of a threat for now.NERVOUS NEIGHBOURSNorth Korea had asked the South to provide heat-detecting cameras to monitor temperatures of South Korean workers travelling to the inter-Korean Kaesong Industrial Complex, a South Korean government official said.South Korea lent North Korea three cameras to use at the complex during a recent scare over Ebola.The WHO has not recommended travel curbs, but about 7,000 people from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan had cancelled trips to South Korea as of June 2, the Korea Tourism Organisation said.Japan said it was looking into possible quarantine measures for people arriving from South Korea.China last week reported its first case, that of a South Korean man who tested positive after breaking a voluntary house quarantine and travelling to Hong Kong and on to mainland China.Authorities have been criticised for being slow to respond to the initial spread of MERS.It took several days for the 68-year-old man returning from the Middle East to be diagnosed, during which time he infected people at health facilities where he sought treatment.All of South Korea's cases have been traced to the man who visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the countries with the most MERS cases.The man whose death was confirmed on Thursday was the sixth person in the South Korean outbreak to get the virus through tertiary infection, meaning he caught it from a patient infected by the original carrier. All the other cases have been traced directly to the ""index"" patient.As many as 1,164 schools in South Korea had closed or cancelled classes by Thursday, the Ministry of Education said.While there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission, the virus could change and spread rapidly.South Korea's new cases bring the total globally to about 1,180, based on WHO data, with at least 442 related deaths.

Cops had faced recent criticism for incidents that included pepper-spraying a handcuffed woman and shooting a suspect to death.The town's police duties will be taken over by officers from neighboring Vinita Park. Chief Tim Swope said during a press conference on Tuesday that he plans to hire as many as 10 additional officers for his force of 21, and former Wellston officers are welcome to apply. Swope said Vinita Park officers earn $20 dollars an hour and receive benefits. That's significantly better than those who worked for Wellston, where officers had to buy their own guns, ammunition and uniforms. Wellston, which covers just 596 acres, is home to about 2,000 people, 95 percent of them African-American. The impoverished town is blighted with vacant buildings and plagued by violent crime. Wellston’s website says the town was founded in 1909, then dissolved due to “government difficulties” and reestablished in 1949.In recent years, Wellston has made headlines for municipal embarrassments. In 2013, an officer was caught on video pepper-spraying a woman while she was handcuffed. Last year, the FBI raided city hall, seizing financial records. In March, a police shooting led to a suspect’s death. On Monday, a city councilwoman was arrested on unspecified charges. It's unclear whether Wellston, like many small cities in St. Louis County, used its police force to bedevil residents with fines and fees. The U.S. Justice Department report examining conditions surrounding the August police shooting of teenager Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson found some municipalities in the county used police and local courts as cash machines to fund city government.Both Wellston and Vinita Park failed to comply with an advocacy group's open records request for police department and municipal court finance details. Newly elected Ferguson City Council member Wesley Bell was hired by Wellston to deliver the data, according to the group Better Together. St. Louis Public Radio reported that Bell also helped negotiate Vinita Park's deal to take over Wellston's policing. Bell could not be reached for comment."

Nestle, the world's largest food and beverage company by revenue, announced this week that it will remove artificial flavors and 10 percent of the sodium from about 250 of its packaged foods sold in America, including Hot Pockets and DiGiornio frozen pizzas, by the end of 2015. The move also affects products under the Tombstone, California Pizza Kitchen, Jack's and Lean Pockets brands -- all among the best-selling brands of frozen pizza in the country. Nestle will also start printing healthy eating advice on the packaging of these products that will ""help educate consumers on choosing appropriate portion sizes and the importance of eating vegetables and fruits as part of a balanced plate,"" read a company press release. The announcement comes on the heels of several similar commitments by other major food companies, including Kraft, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, to cut back on artificial ingredients in an effort to make their products more wholesome. It also builds on several previous initiatives at Nestle's American division to remove salt and artificial flavorings and dyes from popular snacks such as Butterfingers candy bars and Stouffer's frozen dinners. Concern over artificial ingredients has grown in recent years. The Pew Charitable Trusts, for example, released a study in August 2013 that argued the Food and Drug Administration's screening process for new food additives is marred by influence from industry agents. And the FDA itself issued a report in 2011 that concluded that artificial food dyes may exacerbate symptoms of behavioral disorders in children. The discourse around additives has also attracted the input of decidedly less expert voices, such as Vana Hari, the so-called ""Food Babe,"" who has aggressively criticized ingredients as injurious to human health on her blog. Though her opinions have not aligned with science, her popularity reflects, and spurs on, the public desire for more information and fewer ingredients. Most of the concern around flavorings, in particular, has focused on the role they play in making foods irresistible to the human palate, thereby encouraging overeating. Yet it's important to note that removing artificial flavorings, as Nestle has committed to do, doesn't mean removing flavorings altogether. Instead, companies often replace them with so-called ""natural flavorings,"" which are derived from animal, plant or microbiological sources rather than crafted in factories in New Jersey. And health experts have often noted that there's little reason to believe that natural flavors are significantly different from artificial in their health effects. Because the human nose is extremely sensitive to subtle differences between types of odor molecules, an artificial flavor must be chemically identical to its natural counterpart in order to register accurately. On the other hand, the epidemiological evidence on sodium consumption is quite clear: It's bad, and we do too much of it. So in that area, at least, Nestle deserves the good PR this announcement will garner.   Follow Us On Pinterest |  Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter"

That day, April 14, 2012, I began a journey to find a reason, happiness again, and a purpose for my heartbreak-changed life. That day, my second son Leo Blue was born still. I had a month off of work to heal and to be with my first son, Kingston, which was very important to my healing. During that time I realized how precious life is and how quickly it can change. I needed a break from all that was happening to sit back and think. My second son, Leo Blue, gave me that time. That was my first indication that even in his death -- even in the sadness that overcame me -- something else was going on. I truly believe there are no coincidences in life. Only genuine experiences. Knowing that saved me on what was the saddest day of my life. I knew in an instant that even though Leo died, he would fill me with much purpose. What I did not realize were the ways he would show me he was still with me. In August 2012, I set up a session with a photographer to come to our farm and take photos of our family. I went to the store and got fourteen balloons in the colors of the rainbow to have in our photos. I got a call at five o'clock from the photographer saying she could not come; lightning had struck the house next to her parents' home and she could not get down her street with all of the cars blocking the road. I was sad because we had been waiting for this session and I was already anxious about how the first photo of our family without one of our family members would be. I had gotten all made up and it was not going to happen. The photographer explained she would be back in town in a few months and promised us we would get first pick on another session. We rescheduled for November 10. I was eight weeks pregnant. I shared with our photographer, Emily, when she pulled up to the house that I wanted to capture ""announcement"" photos of our new baby expected in July of 2013. I found a blue oven on our farm. I painted a sign. I wanted to use them in these photos to announce we were expecting. Emily started shooting and abruptly stopped. She said, ""You don't know what you are having do you?"" I said, ""No, I'm not far enough along. We should find out sometime in January."" ""Well,"" she said, ''when you find out you will have to let me know. Look at this photo, I have never seen a pink light like this in a photo."" She showed me the back of her camera... and this is what she found.A few months later we found out we were expecting a sweet baby girl. What a gift. I know Leo was showing us in that photo three months before that he was with us and showing us what a gift we would be getting in our little girl. The photo gives me chills to this day. Even though I was overjoyed to be pregnant again, days were still hard. I still missed Leo. The day he died, I insisted my husband drive me to school, where I was finishing my Bachelors of Science in nursing, to turn in one of my assignments. I still do not know how I was in a state to remember to turn in an assignment. My family and friends thought I should take a break from school but the promise to my family to further my education was something I could not give up on. I felt staying in school and pursing my dream would honor the baby that I carried.   One winter night, I was driving home from classes and I was having an exceptionally hard time. I was crying and missing my baby, pregnant with his sister, and the night was dark. The streetlights off of our exit kept shining on the back of my car after an eleven-mile expressway drive. I kept glancing in my rear view mirror and at the first gas station I hopped out. Could it be? I snapped this photo. Angel wings. From Leo.I felt like this was the push from Leo telling me that I was on the right path. That he was with me, leading me on my way to what was my destiny.A baby girl meant a revision of our house. We spent so many days after doctor appointments in a home goods store trying to find perfect paint, perfect lighting, everything had to be just right. Our baby girl's room would be built into our bedroom and that meant drywall, new floors, and lots and lots of construction. I was having a rough morning getting ready for work in May 2013, just two months before our little girl would be here. The days were especially intense because I just wanted to hold my little girl in my arms, safe and sound, alive and well. As I got out of bed and walked down the tiny hallway from our bedroom past our expecting baby's room, I saw this on the ground. It stopped me in my tracks and filled my heart up with so much hope. Drywall mud on the carpet we were tearing up. I told my husband to hurry. When I looked at him I said ""I think she is going to be okay. I think Leo is telling us she is okay.""When our daughter came on July 10, 2013, all of our family took a guess on her weight. I guessed her weight at 8 pounds 2 ounces. Everyone took a guess. There was never a time more intense than going to the hospital to have our daughter. We were so close to the dream of holding our third baby. When she was born I could not speak and I could not believe she was here to hold. She was ours. I could not stop touching her and looking at her. Lola Franklin and I had our time to bond and the nurse placed her on the scale. ""How big is she,"" I asked. ""Eight pounds, two ounces,"" shouted over the nurse. I looked at my husband and just smiled. Then tears. We were meant for one another. In that moment I felt my second son telling me, ""Here she is Momma. Just as you wished and not one ounce more or less. Take her."" You see, I believe that the gift of mothering a child that is no longer wrapped in your arms is that they show us a greater purpose and that if you give yourself time to open your broken heart and tear-soaked eyes you will see that your baby never left you. It makes my life more meaningful and special and because of that I realize with each year that passes that this baby, my second son, is just as much a part of our lives as Kingston and Lola. The days my arms long to hug him I make it a point to find the sign he shows me. Some days the sign is small. Other days it stops me in my tracks and takes my breath away. Last year after winding down from an event on my husband's birthday, I took Kingston and Lola to their favorite train park, determined to get a photo of them together. Family birthdays are always a little tricky for me as I long for baby Leo a little more. I posted this photo that night on Facebook telling all my friends that while their daddy got to spend some time doing farm work at home, I took the kids out for a mommy-and-me fun day. It wasn't until I posted the photo of my kiddos that I saw my baby Leo. Right there, smack dab in the middle, looking like little angel wings, surely telling us that he is always with them and will always be a part of their lives. To anyone who has lost a child, you may have felt you lost everything the day your baby died. What I want to tell you is that you did not lose a thing. I believe these signs are here for all of us to see. We just have to be able to see it. And when we do see it, to know our loved ones are comforting us. The path to healing is in knowing that you held an angel and that they will always be with you. Knowing that my baby is always with me has given me my new life, a new birthday, and in knowing that, I have been set free. Set free from shame, or guilt, fear, or disappointment. And brought to a place of comfort, purpose, and a life that holds new meaning for my family and me. I hope today you find comfort in knowing that just because your baby died it does not mean that your relationship stops there. I know I'm only three years into my relationship with Leo and I do not have all the answers. But I promise you that if you venture out in search of your baby, he or she will show you they are never truly that far away. You arms are still yearning to hold them but your heart knows right where your baby will always be. And I hope in that you start to realize you did not lose one single thing and see the beautiful life that you gained. _______________________Stacey Gripshover is a registered nurse who lives on her family's farm in Verona, Kentucky.

Moms can use the app each day, while the app logs their kick-counting history. Moms can then see what is normal for their baby and will know if their baby's movement pattern is changing. Count the Kicks urges expectant moms to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they see significant changes in their baby's movement patterns. The app comes with a helpful daily reminder that expectant moms can set to their convenience.

But two decades of stalling on the relocation could soon end if the 2016 GOP candidates have their way.Every six months, Obama sends the same memo to the secretary of state, stating the need to delay the move in order to “protect the national security interests of the United States.” The biannual letter is necessary because a law passed by Congress in 1995 requires the American embassy to be moved to the disputed city of Jerusalem by May 31, 1999. The bill also declared that the U.S. government supported the recognition of Jerusalem as an undivided city and the capital of Israel. Congress threatened to withhold half of the State Department’s funding for “acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad” if the Jerusalem-based embassy did not open by 1999. Despite widespread bipartisan support -- the bill passed 93-5 in the Senate and 374-37 in the House -- the new embassy never opened and the State Department’s funding continued to flow. Since the passage of the legislation, Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and, now, Obama have taken advantage of a national security waiver provision in the bill, which allows the president to suspend the embassy move for six months. While several countries, including the U.S., have consulates in Jerusalem, most foreign embassies are located in Tel Aviv, which the international community treats as the de facto capital of Israel. The status of Jerusalem remains one of the key obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. Israel claimed Jerusalem as its capital in 1950 and annexed the eastern part of the city during the 1967 Six-Day War -- but the Palestinians view Jerusalem as the rightful capital of their future state. Successive administrations have resisted the embassy relocation because the U.S. government does not recognize Israel’s annexation of East Jerusalem. At the same time, however, the U.S. has been reluctant to describe Jerusalem as “occupied territory,” since that would make it subject to the same international sanctions as the settlements in the West Bank. U.S. administrations have historically supported the idea of placing Jerusalem under international jurisdiction as part of a peace agreement.Now, however, candidates for the Republican nomination in 2016 are promising to finally move the embassy, as they compete to outdo one another in demonstrations of support for Israel. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are both running for president in 2016, are co-sponsoring a new version of the 1995 legislation. However, the new and improved law would remove the national security waiver that has allowed the past three presidents to delay moving the embassy from Tel Aviv. During a fundraising event in Tennessee on Saturday, soon-to-be candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told reporters he supported moving the embassy to Jerusalem “not just as a symbol, but a show of solidarity.” While considering a 2012 GOP campaign, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee vowed that, ""If I were president of the United States, I would move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem."" Huckabee, who entered the presidential fray for 2016 last month, reiterated his support for Israel at an Israel Day celebration in New York on Monday. Regardless of the outcome of the 2016 election, however, the U.S. embassy is likely to remain in Tel Aviv. Since 1995, the Republican presidential platform has included a promise to move the embassy to Jerusalem. Yet Bush continued to sign waivers to avoid making the move during his eight years as president. In 1992, Clinton campaigned on relocating the embassy. Once in office, however, he failed to follow through on that promise, which was part of the impetus for Congress to pass the 1995 law.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated incorrectly that Mike Huckabee ran for president in 2012. He just considered a run in 2012."

The percentage of Republicans who describe themselves as socially and economically moderate or liberal has jumped 5 points in the last two years, reaching 24 percent. Where do the rest of the Republicans fall on the scale? Twenty percent describe themselves as socially moderate or liberal and economically conservative. This group has remained relatively unchanged in the last six years. The fourth category, those that describe themselves as socially conservative but economically moderate or liberal, represents the smallest portion, making up just 10 percent of the party. These findings indicate that Republicans are part of an overall national trend: a record number of Americans now describe themselves as socially liberal. In fact, Americans are shifting left on a number of social issues. Same-sex marriage has reached a record level of support, as has marijuana legalization. Americans are also becoming increasingly less religious, according to a Pew Research study released in May.Gallup notes that although the shift is significant, it is not unprecedented. But it may present a unique challenge to 2016 GOP candidates, as they now face a conservative base that is less than 50 percent of the party. Gallup surveyed 1,024 adults between May 6-10 via live interviews on landlines and cell phones. "

Early voting was due to begin Monday ahead of May 11 statewide county elections. The Democratic and Republican parties are vying for the Latino vote nationwide following President Obama's landslide victory among Hispanic voters in the 2012 election. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fdf02500008e013a5f1e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Latino voters care deeply about green issues, and could be a crucial voting bloc in support of environmentally-friendly legislation, according to a new report. The report, published jointly by Latino Decisions, a political opinion research group, and the nonprofit Hispanic Access Foundation, found that more than two-thirds of Latinos believed air and water pollution were ""very"" or ""extremely important"" issues. The Latino voting bloc was instrumental in passing conservation tax propositions in Colorado, New Mexico and California -- where Latinos make up 11, 35 and 25 percent of voters, respectively. Latino voters were also essential in passing Florida’s Amendment 1, which dedicated funds to conserving natural resources and recreation lands in the state. Latinos make up 19 percent of voters in that state.Released on Wednesday, the report comes after a poll from The New York Times, Stanford University and Resources for the Future found that more than half of Hispanic voters considered global warming “extremely or very important to them personally.” Nearly two-thirds of them responded that the federal government should act on climate. But although 70 percent of Hispanics polled in 2014 said they believed it was very or extremely important for the federal government to “take measures to reduce carbon pollution that is causing global warming or climate change,” another Latino Decisions poll conducted last year found that just 1 percent put environmental concern among the most important issues facing their community.The Hispanic voting population -- widely perceived to be a crucial bloc in the 2016 elections -- remains focused on immigration reform. The next most important issue on their mind is the economy. In 2014, Hispanics/Latinos represented 8 percent of voters nationwide, slightly down from 10 percent in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center. Latino Decisions analyzed several different 2014 polls of Latino voters for Wednesday's study, including a Latino Decisions Election Eve Poll, a HECHO/Latino Decisions survey of the Colorado and New Mexico Hispanic electorate, two NCLRAF/Latino Decisions surveys of Colorado and Florida and a national survey from the Natural Resources Defense Council.

27,POLITICS,Democrats Go After Jimmy John's And Amazon,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/non-compete-bill_n_7506156.html,,2015-06-03,"WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 4: Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) speaks at a news conference to discuss the Affordable Care Act case being heard at the Supreme Court, March 4, 2015 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Today the Supreme Court was scheduled to hear oral arguments in the case of King v. Burwell that could determine the fate of health care subsidies for as many as eight million people. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fdf02600002d0183c610.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Chiding companies such as Jimmy John's and Amazon.com, Senate Democrats introduced a bill Wednesday that would forbid employers from requiring low-wage workers to sign noncompete agreements, a practice they said locks workers into their jobs and depresses wages.The bill, called the Mobility and Opportunity for Vulnerable Employees Act, or MOVE Act, would bar noncompete agreements for workers earning less $15 per hour, and would require companies to inform job-seekers ahead of time if they will be asked to sign one. The legislation was introduced by Sens. Chris Murphy (Conn.) and Al Franken (Minn.), who were joined by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) as co-sponsors.Murphy said Wednesday that the purpose of the bill was to assure a free labor market, so that workers on the lower end of the income scale can freely move to jobs that pay better.""If workers can’t go to a competitor for a promised higher wage, then the market fluidity -- the labor fluidity that creates upward pressure on wages -- disappears,"" Murphy said at a press conference. ""If workers are locked into jobs because of noncompete clauses, then there is no reason for companies to raise their wages.""The Huffington Post reported last year that many low-wage employees at Jimmy John's sandwich shops had been asked to sign noncompete clauses, agreeing not to work at competing sandwich shops for two years after their employment ended. (It was left to franchisees whether to execute the agreement, and use of the clause varied from location to location.) Congressional Democrats, in response, asked the Labor Department and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the use of such contracts.In March, The Verge reported that Amazon.com had been asking low-wage temporary warehouse workers to sign similar agreements, potentially barring them from working at competitors for 18 months after their Amazon stints. Amazon said it would stop asking workers to sign the agreements after The Verge report.Noncompete agreements are common for high-ranking executives or workers who may hold proprietary information, such as software engineers. The contracts give companies peace of mind in knowing a worker with sensitive information can't jump ship and take it to a competitor. But as The New York Times reported last year, the use of noncompetes has spread to low-wage jobs, such as camp counselor, where it's not clear what sort of secrets the worker could hold.As HuffPost reported in November, even a doggy day care chain, Camp Bow Wow, has required dog-sitters to sign noncompete agreements as a condition of employment.Critics of the agreements say they disrupt a free labor market and prevent workers from taking their skills to the highest bidder, thereby reducing worker bargaining power. And even though a noncompete would be difficult to enforce on a low-wage worker -- under most state laws, such agreements must be reasonable in scope -- critics say they may still present a barrier to workers who can't afford to fight them in court.The bill introduced by Murphy and Franken would bar noncompete agreements for low-wage workers by amending the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Great Depression-era law that established a minimum wage and overtime pay. The senators said Wednesday that if it does not move as a stand-alone bill, they would look to attach it to other legislation as an amendment.""I would really like to hear the argument against this,"" Franken said. ""I don’t think this is really that hard a lift.""The bill's introduction drew praise from the National Employment Law Project, a left-leaning nonprofit that advocates for low-wage workers. At a press conference, Judy Conti, federal advocacy coordinator for the group, said she hopes the legislation will encourage low-wage employers to abandon the practice of using noncompetes.""And we hope state legislators take note and work on similar measure across country,"" Conti said of the bill."
