0,WELLNESS,It's Not Always a Good Thing When Your Cups Runneth Over,"Gregg McBride, Contributor
Author, screenwriter and blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/portion-control_us_5b9c5013e4b03a1dcc7db920,"I realized that keeping my portions and food choices in mind was something I was going to have to stay committed to for the rest of my life -- assuming I wanted to keep fitting into my newly aquired ""regular size"" clothes.",2012-10-18,2012-09-19-greggmcbridemeasuringcupsjuststopeatingsomuch.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-09-19-greggmcbridemeasuringcupsjuststopeatingsomuch.JPG,"I remember when I tipped the scales at over 450 pounds and began dieting the sane way (eating less, moving more, getting plenty of sleep and drinking enough water). The success was immediate, and I lost most of my excess weight (over 250 pounds of it) in just about a year's time. Still, it was a tough journey -- during which there were many moments when I looked forward to the diet being ""over"" so that I could go back to what I thought was the ""normal way of eating.""Little did I realize that what I thought was a normal way of eating (gobbling down whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted) was actually anything but normal -- and certainly not the way to attain and maintain everlasting health. This, alas, has meant that the ""diet mentality"" is one that I've had to keep at the forefront of my mind every day of my life (even after reaching my goal weight of around 175 pounds).I discovered this sobering fact after I reached my goal weight and started ""allowing"" myself to eat the way I used to eat (before the diet). Needless to say, I did some yo-yo-ing. Up the scale a few pounds. Down the scale a few pounds. Up the scale several pounds (into the high double digits)... And so on. Before long, I realized that keeping my portions and food choices in mind was something I was going to have to stay committed to for the rest of my life -- assuming I wanted to keep fitting into my newly aquired ""regular size"" clothes (not to mention keep my newly aquired healthy blood pressure, cholestrol counts, etc.).Even today, there are times that my cup (as in my measuring cup) runneth over. And in the case of food intake, that's not necessarily a good thing. Perhaps it's when pouring a ""mountainous cup"" of cereal for myself in the morning. Or when choosing a large size of frozen yogurt (instead of a medium one) on a Saturday afternoon. Or even when slicing too much avocado onto my lunch salad or (heaven forbid!) when steaming too many green beans to serve with my evening meal.""Stop the presses!"" you might be thinking to yourself. ""Can there really be such a thing as too many steamed green beans?"" Well, in my experience... absolutely. In fact, there can be too much of anything -- whether it's green beans, avocado or ice cream. I find that once I teeter into the ""too much food"" territory (even if semi-innocently through green beans serving as a ""gateway drug"" of sorts), this habit soon has the potential to overtake all of my food portion measurements and/or choices. And eventually this leads to my jeans being a little less fun to pull on -- much less fasten. And don't get me started on buckling the belt.Luckily for me, slightly tighter clothes offer the signal that something's off in my daily routine. And even as I blog about and share my ideas for weight loss success, every now and then I must shout out, ""Physician, heal thyself."" (Technically it's blogger, heal thyself -- but physician sounds so much more lofty, don't you think?)So, yes. Recently I've had to pull out my set of measuring cups and reincorporate them into daily use. It turns out that even after a decade of losing the excess weight and keeping it off, I can't always be trusted when pouring my multigrain breakfast cereal. As much as I'd like to think that I can ""eyeball"" a desired portion, it's not always true. Especially right after my morning workout when my stomach is growling loudly. When first using measuring cups after a period of not using them, I'm usually surprised at how ""small"" a cup of cereal (or a healthy portion of steamed green beans) is. Then again, I'm also surprised (happily so) by what it's like to eat a healthy portion and feel satiated without feeling overly full after a meal. This is all a good reminder that sometimes it's necessary to reaquaint ourselves with what kinds of portions we should be eating to achieve lasting health (not to mention which kinds of foods).So as much as I sometimes think to myself, ""I shouldn't have to measure my portions anymore,"" my jeans remind me that I do. And this consciousness is necessary for every other aspect of my healthy eating (and living) efforts as well. Think of it as a reboot if you will... a reminder that sometimes we must recalibrate to recommit (and perhaps even re-achieve) the success that we've worked so hard for -- and that we want to maintain for the rest of our lives.For more by Gregg McBride, click here.For more on weight loss, click here."

Well, in my new novel, William Edwards and the Wizardly Glasses, William Edwards has friends who use their magical powers to protect him, and he learns to walk away from the people or situations that make him feel excluded. What's it like for a real kid who has food allergies? I sat down with Kenton Duty, who co-starred on Disney's Shake It Up, for a Skype interview. He spoke with me about his experiences with food allergies and bullying and his advocacy work. Kenton Duty stars as Gunther on Disney Channel's Shake It Up. (DISNEY CHANNEL/BOB D'AMICO. Photo used with permission. While its easy to think that popularity, especially the kind that a Hollywood star has, would protect you against being teased and bullied, that hasn't been the case for Kenton Duty. Despite being a Disney star and having more than 200,000 followers on Twitter, Kenton Duty, who is allergic to chocolate and wheat, said, ""I get bullied all of the time,"" from playful pestering to ""full on peer-pressure, 'Eat this!'""The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) recently reported  that 79 percent of children with food allergies surveyed reported that they had been bullied because of their food allergy, and 57 percent of the children said that the bully harassed them or touched them with the food to which they are allergic. (The study, ""Bullying Among Pediatric Patients With Food Allergies,"" was published in the journal Pediatrics.)Kenton Duty has a mature understanding of his situation. He avoids eating foods to which he is allergic and carries epinephrine auto injectors, which contain life-saving medicine to self-administer if he ever goes into anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction. He takes these protective measures despite never having had anaphylaxis, knowing that his next allergic reaction could be that severe. ""This is something that I have to live with, and this is what I need to do,"" he asserted. Of course, Kenton Duty does not advise just letting go of incidents where you are teased or bullied with your food allergen. He advises kids to report these incidents to the adult in charge, whether it's a teacher, vice principal, principal, guidance counselor (most -- 80 percent -- of bullying incidences occur at school), or manager, if at work and, to your parents. He also said kids should tell their friends. ""If you have good friends, they will have your back,"" he said.Still, some teens don't carry their life-saving epinephrine auto injectors with them at all times. To that behavior, Kenton Duty had this to say: ""I think it's sort of a dumb way to live your life.""  ""You've got to take charge,"" he said. In addition to carry an epinephrine auto injector, Kenton Duty urges teens like him who have food allergies to wear medical alert jewelry. He pointed out that the jewelry can ""speak"" for them if they are choking during anaphylaxis so that people will know what's wrong and what emergency action to take. ""[T]hat bracelet can save your life,"" he said. And for those teens who do take control of their lives, Kenton Duty said that having food allergies can be a silver lining versus a cloud hanging over them. He said that he eats healthier and laughed about saving money on dates. He also said it's helped him to be with other teens who have food allergies, joking that none of them think it's strange to be allergic to chocolate. In fact, he's even kept in touch with some of the teens he met at a FAAN Teen Summit that he attended. (So, if you want to hang out with Kenton Duty and learn more about food allergies, he'll be back again at FAAN's teen summit this year in Washington, D.C.)In addition to speaking out about food allergies, Kenton Duty has used his celebrity status to promote the Starlight Foundation, Make-A-Wish Foundation, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Los Angeles to increase awareness and engage his fans in supporting these nonprofits to help raise funds through social networking, even if it's just retweeting a tweet, he said. Kenton Duty's work with all of these nonprofits is solely as a volunteer.As for dating, Kenton Duty tells his date if she wants to kiss him, that she won't be able to eat what he's allergic to.

3,PARENTING,The Condition That Kept Me From Breastfeeding,"Babble.com, Contributor
Real parents sharing real moments that help you think, help yo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breast-hypoplasia-breastfeeding-trouble_us_5b9c56bae4b03a1dcc7de663,"The truth is, all those people I consulted should have been able to take one look at my chest and know that breastfeeding might be difficult, if not impossible, for me.",2012-10-18,Bright mother feeding her adorable son in the kitchen at home,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c56ba2200003000d9324b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Written by Lisa Selin Davis for Babble.comIn eighth grade, my best friend Jenny Platt brought me to her doctor. ""Let's just ask her,"" she said reassuringly, her arm slung over my shoulders -- she had discussed womanly matters with this doctor before, and found her easy to talk to. So we took the bus over to a medical complex sandwiched in between the University of Massachusetts and some strip malls, into a bland, beige office where I took off my shirt and bra. ""What's the matter with them?"" I asked.The doctor, too, was reassuring. ""Nothing,"" she said. ""They're just ... long.""My boobs seemed to lack bounce and elasticity. Indeed (and, it turns out, ironically), they looked more like the breasts of someone who had breastfed a couple of kids rather than those of an already fully developed 13-year-old girl. They were C-cups -- that weren't really cup-shaped at all.""I see all shapes and sizes of breasts,"" the doctor continued. ""And these are perfectly normal."" Not normal like Jenny's perfect, perky breasts, of course, but not ugly, either. Just, you know, somehow missing the flesh in the middle that would, and should, create a nice line of cleavage. But normal. So she said. Related: 10 things every woman should do before having kidsFlash-forward 25 years, after many sexual adventures where my bra was left firmly on, and a lifetime of shamed over breasts that just didn't look like those in the 1970s Playboys that Jenny and I once discovered under a bush behind her house. All these years later, one of the things that excited me most about becoming a mother was the chance to breastfeed. I believed it would repair my relationship with my breasts, make me feel normal the way that doctor had pronounced me to be.""How come my breasts aren't getting any bigger?"" I asked a pediatrician friend, when I was six, then seven, then eight months pregnant.""Sometimes that doesn't happen until you have the baby and the milk comes in,"" she said, just as reassuringly as Jenny and the doctor from 8th grade had. I accepted this news the way I had the doctor's pronouncement of normal: with the sinking suspicion that they were wrong.At nine months and one day, after 35 hours of labor and a natural childbirth, my beautiful baby girl was placed on my breast and began suckling immediately. But three, four, then five days later, my breasts weren't responsive. ""How come I don't have any milk yet?"" I asked the midwives.They were less reassuring.A week after Enna arrived, I still had not one drop of milk. They assigned me a regiment of near-constant pumping, herbs, and imported Canadian drugs not intended for lactation failure (there is no such drug, of course) but that had a side effect of milk-making (a class of drugs known as galactogogues). Nothing worked. I shelled out several hundred dollars to lactation consultants who told me to just ""try harder"" -- pump more, nurse more, even feed formula through a tube attached to my breast that would simulate nursing. They told me my daughter was not talented at latching. They told me we were both doing it wrong.I kept at it, pressured by the midwives and lactation consultants not to use formula or a bottle. Enna lost 12, then 14 percent of her body weight. I sat sobbing in the bathroom, not just because I wouldn't be able to keep my child alive with my own body, but because I was terrified of what I'd heard about formula-fed babies: they'd have lower IQs and a tendency to be obese. And, yeah, I was crying because my breasts weren't normal after all.Enna's pediatrician put her hand on my forearm and said, gently but firmly: ""Get some formula. Now.""The truth is, all those people I consulted should have been able to take one look at my chest and know that breastfeeding might be difficult, if not impossible, for me; I have a medical condition called breast hypoplasia.You've never heard of it, right? Neither had my midwives, my OB, my pediatrician, my PCP, or my third cousin, a reproductive endocrinologist. Nor had any of the lactation consultants who saw me. Heck, even my computer is telling me that hypoplasia isn't a real word. I actually heard about it from a health journalist friend, who had randomly come across a post about it on Facebook. ""Are you sort of missing the flesh in the middle of your breasts?"" she asked me.I looked down at my chest. Yes, actually, that's exactly how I'd describe it.""Then I might know what happened to you.""I immediately scoured the Internet for information on breast hypoplasia. If your breasts are widely spaced (as in no cleavage, no matter how big they are), asymmetrical, contain stretch marks, are tubular in shape (""long,"" as per the doc) and/or don't grow during pregnancy, then, yep, you might have breast hypoplasia. A woman with this condition might not have the right parts to produce milk; they're either missing or severely underdeveloped.There is, according to my lactation consultant sources, one study that cross-references breast appearance with ability to breastfeed, and the results are startling: women with a space between their breasts of 1.5 inches or more produced, on average, 50 percent less milk than women with normal breast spacing. ""Sixty-one percent of the women followed were unable to produce a full milk supply within the first month,"" the study reports. Most of those women, like me, experienced no growth in breast size during pregnancy.What makes it difficult to diagnose is that some women with breast hypoplasia can breastfeed just fine -- 39 percent of the women in the study above had a perfectly good milk supply. And other women with ""perfect"" Playboy breasts might have a similar condition called IGT, or Insufficient Glandular Tissue, giving them the inability to produce a lot of milk.As many as one in 1,000 mothers may experience lactation failure, but there's no way to tell how many of them have breast hypoplasia or IGT, in part because they're not official diagnoses. There's no accompanying code that your insurance company can use for reimbursements. Hypoplasia is a ""condition"" only in the plastic surgery field, in which it's called ""tubular breast deformity,"" which sounds even worse. Women with hypoplastic breasts and a lot of pocket change may get implants or breast augmentation, and if they have trouble breastfeeding later it may be blamed on the surgery, when in fact it's the physical makeup of the breast, pre-saline or -silicone, that caused the problem.Reading about the condition, and perusing pictures of it, I felt I got off easy. My breasts looked pretty darn good compared to some of the women I saw (there's a reason the doctor pronounced me normal). The diagnosis confirmed my worst fears about myself -- I was officially deformed -- but it alleviated the top layer of guilt over not being able to breastfeed my kid.I surrendered the vision of myself as a breastfeeding mother, and began to formula-feed. Once Enna was gaining weight and healthy, the panic diffused. But those subterranean seeds of shame kept sprouting. I was angry at those lactation consultants for taking my money and not realizing that in my case, breastfeeding probably wasn't going to happen. The diagnosis hasn't been legitimized by the medical community, or society in general -- according to Dr. Amy Evans, a fellow of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, only 75 doctors in the world have a breastfeeding sub-specialty, and even some of those are skeptical about hypoplasia. Feeding my baby a bottle still made me feel like a criminal. After all, breast is best.The reactions of my fellow moms didn't help. I stopped into the childcare room at my local food co-op to feed the baby, and the chatter in the room -- a discussion of weaning adventures -- came to a halt. They stared as Enna gulped back her formula-filled bottle.I tried to get donations from an online milk-sharing group, but I was deemed unqualified, since I hadn't had a mastectomy or survived cancer. ""If you are a mother with low milk supply who thinks that you have 'tried' everything, please let us try to help you some more,"" they implored.I took Enna to a baby-wearing group, where another woman, baby attached to her breast, sidled up to me and whispered, ""I give my baby formula, too -- just not in public."" It was the first secret club I'd belonged to -- not the Masons, or Skull and Bones, but a class of formula-feeding mothers so ashamed that they pretended to breastfeed.Pregnant friends said pityingly, ""I heard what happened to you,"" as if I had been the victim of an assault. And then they'd add, ""I hope it doesn't happen to me.""None of these moms were looking at my daughter as they said this, of course. Because if they did look at her, with her cherubic face, her caramel-colored finger curls, her golden smile -- she was one cute formula-fed baby -- they wouldn't have pitied me or feared replicating my situation. Yeah, my kid drank formula, full of things I would have preferred not to give her: cow's milk powder and corn syrup, to name two. She drank from a bottle, after ""nursing"" on my breasts for a few minutes at each feeding so that we'd get all the emotional benefits of breastfeeding, if not the physical ones. And she thrived.Slowly, something changed in me. I began to be almost proud, defiant, about the presence of the bottle in my life. Breast is best, sure, but many of my breastfeeding friends had to give their children iron supplements or vitamin D drops to make up for what breast milk lacked. I didn't need to pump in the middle of night or hide in a darkened room to do so at work. I held up my kid as a poster child for bottle-feeding.Related: Extreme breastfeeding! 20 photos of moms nursing in amazing places""This is your worst fear,"" I'd say. ""This is what you're dreading if you can't make breastfeeding work."" Friends would consult me about what types of bottles to buy, what brands of formula; I tried to be a fountain of knowledge, instead of a cautionary tale.Because it's information that mothers should have. For most women, breastfeeding is really hard. It hurts. It can take weeks for mother and baby to get the hang of it. And a generation of well-meaning women, determined to reclaim the act as a lost art after the formula-push of the mid-20th century, can make it worse with their pressure and judgment.These days, I've decided not to push bottle or breast, not to contribute to the complex cloud of emotions women feel about feeding their babies one way or another. But there is one thing I'm committed to: telling the world about breast hypoplasia, getting women to come out of the closet about it. It happened to me, and while I can't report that my relationship to my breasts is repaired -- and no, I'm not going to show you them -- my relationship to my child is fully fortified. My baby is not just fine: she's wonderful.MORE ON BABBLE 28 things you should NEVER say to a pregnant woman 10 ""unsafe"" things I did while pregnant...and still had a healthy baby 25 powerful photos of women giving birth 25 ways husbands embarrass their wives in the delivery room"
4,WELLNESS,Genetically-Modified Organisms or GMOs: What Are You Really Eating?,"Caroline J. Cederquist, M.D., Contributor
Board-certified bariatric physician",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prop-37-california_us_5b9c6a75e4b03a1dcc7e787d,"There is an interesting aspect of the argument over labeling GM products that is centered upon our individual right to guide our own lives and make our own choices.

There is no place for ""Big Ag"" at my dinner table.",2012-10-18,"A picture taken on August 22, 2012 in Godewaersvelde, northern France shows a corn field.

I have been appalled in the past weeks as I have watched what I will call ""Big Ag"" crank up their political machine and throw millions of dollars into attack ads and propaganda against California's Proposition 37. The proposed law, which would require mandatory labeling of genetically-engineered food, has come under increasing fire as of late. In the past weeks alone, a coalition of the biggest stakeholders in the agricultural industry has raised more than $34.6 million dollars to defeat the proposition. The question that all Americans, not just Californians, must ask is: ""Why?""Who Wants to Know About GMO?You might be shocked to learn that a national CBS News poll around that 87 percent of Americans favor labeling GM ingredients in their food. You might also be intrigued to learn that no less than 61 nations have some form of GM food labeling requirements on the books. The entire EU has required such labeling since 1997.This begs the question: What could be so terrible about telling the American people whether the product they are about to purchase contains genetically-modified organisms? How on earth, as the Anti-Prop 37 folks claim, could the simple act of labeling these GM products result in higher food costs? There is a simple answer to this question: People may stop buying products made with GMOs.""But wait! How can you support a measure that would raise food prices?"" they say. Again, the answer is relatively simple. The scare tactics being employed by the Anti-Prop 37 crowd assume that California would be going it alone in the effort to label GM foods. While the context of Prop 37 includes only California, 20 more state legislatures across the nation have taken up the issue and currently have pending GM labeling legislation. While the opponents of this movement would like you to think it's just the crazy Californians that are ""up to it again,"" this is simply not the case. While Prop 37 is a California issue, labeling the GMOs present in our food supply is not. This is an issue that deserves national attention. It's time to take this movement out of California, and all other states, for that matter, and take decisive action at the federal level. What Are GMOs Anyway?As a medical doctor, I'd like to take a moment to provide you with some background on GMOs and why they really do matter. To do this, let me first properly define exactly what genetically-modified organisms actually are. At least one of the most common GMOs -- corn, soybeans, rice, and tomatoes -- are found in nearly every food that most of us eat these days.Many people with whom I have ""the GMO conversation"" are unfortunately completely unaware of the methods used to modify formerly naturally-occurring organisms into something entirely different and hardly natural. The World Health Organization defines GMOs as ""organisms in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in such a way that does not occur naturally."" Excerpts from the American Association of Environmental Medicine's website provide a startling glimpse into the creation of today's Frankenstein GM crops: ""This technology is also referred to as 'genetic engineering,' 'biotechnology,' or 'recombinant DNA technology' and consists of randomly inserting genetic fragments of DNA from one organism to another, usually from a different species. For example, an artificial combination of genes that includes a gene to produce the pesticide Cry1Ab protein (commonly known as Bt toxin), originally found in Bacillus thuringiensis, is inserted in to the DNA of corn randomly."" I am not sure about you, but I am not at all comfortable with the notion of bacterial DNA being inserted into my food without my knowledge or consent -- not as a medical professional or a mother.Are They Safe?An often-dismissed argument in the battle over labeling GM products is the simple, yet extremely consequential, question of whether or not these modified ""Frankenfoods"" are safe for human consumption. The powerful agricultural lobby will tell you that these foods are safe because of their ""substantial equivalence"" to the original, natural, version. But just how equivalent are they? A recent peer-reviewed study published in the respected Food and Chemical Toxicology Journal titled ""Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize"" studied the effects of a particular GM seed and the pesticide it has been engineered to withstand when introduced into the food supply of laboratory rats. The findings, though controversial, should be enough to require mandatory labeling of GM products until further long-term studies can be conducted.Essentially, the scientists in charge of the study found that the rats whose diet consisted of the GM corn and its companion pesticide suffered much higher rates of tumors and early death than those in the control group who received a normal rat diet. To be fair, the study has come under scrutiny for its methodology. However, the findings are extremely troubling. With even the tiniest shred of evidence that animals whose diets consist of GMOs have a higher rate of cancer and premature death rates higher than that of their regularly-fed peers, action must be taken. Lack of Long-Term Human StudyAfter reading the paragraph above, you might dismiss some of the findings discussed due to the backlash the study has received from the scientific community. While the strictest measures of scientific methodology and precision may write this study off as flawed, I see the underlying value that it holds, flawed or otherwise. This is not the only animal study to show similar high rates of cancer and early death linked to GM feed. In truth, it is just one of quite a few.What detractors from this study and the labeling of GMOs fail to grasp is that these studies show an increased risk of harmful complications from consuming genetically-modified food. Yes, the complications are in animals, and as everyone knows, these animals are not humans. This fact, however, is not enough to write them off as inconsequential. In fact, their findings point to yet another flaw in the ""trust us"" mentality that ""Big Ag"" expects the American consumer to willingly follow: the lack of credible, non-biased studies showing the effects of the consumption of GM products on a person's health over time. These ""Frankenfoods"" have only become a major part of our food supply in the past decade. That's 16 years that Americans have been unknowingly consuming foods that may be detrimental to their overall health and well-being. While ""Big Ag"" asks the mothers of America to simply ""trust us, everything will be okay,"" this answer is not okay with me. You see, as a board-certified bariatric physician and expert in metabolism, I understand the details of how foods interact with the body. As a mother of four, I also understand that my example will shape the future that I leave for my children.The Responsible Path ForwardFinally, there is an interesting aspect of the argument over labeling GM products that is centered upon our individual right to guide our own lives and make our own choices. When it comes to the most basic of human needs, the food that we eat should be our choice, and ours alone. Simply put, there is no place for ""Big Ag"" at my dinner table.At present, I know of no laws that allow a company to mandate what people must eat. Yet, in not labeling GM products, manufacturers using GM ingredients are essentially doing just that. Without the knowledge that a particular item contains GM ingredients, a consumer cannot reasonably be expected to be able to differentiate on their own. Further, since I've seen data showing that 88 percent of all corn grown in the United States is genetically modified, the choices of non-GMO are becoming increasingly restricted. It should be noted, again, that corn is found in nearly every processed food found at your local grocery store.In sum, I would like to pose the following question: How does obscuring the truth from consumers promote the right to choose what we put in our bodies or our ability to control the food that we consume? As is often the case in the argument over GM labeling, it does no such thing. In fact, the deliberate attempt to hide crucial information pertaining to the integrity and wholesomeness of our food supply is something that should provoke outrage from medical professionals and mothers nationwide.Do you truly believe that the controversy over labeling GMOs is about your best interests as a consumer, or the bottom line of the companies most invested in the business of tampering with your food?For more by Caroline J.

Her pleated pants were subtle enough to not scream ""I love Lexis-Nexis!"" and the slight volume complemented her tiny waist. The best part? Pleated pants are flattering on most body types. The trick is in choosing high-waisted styles that show off your trim mid-section (that's for you hourglass and pear-shaped gals), and making sure that look for small pleats to add just a little volume around your waist (which is nicely balanced by the cropped hems to show off fancy footwear). Ruler-shaped ladies, enjoy the curves that the pleats add to your lean frame, and consider going for wide-legged styles that play nicely with proportions. Here, 11 pairs of pleated pants that are definitely not destined for a cubicle near you -- and they're all under $100. Want more?

About two-thirds of those were homicides, with suicides and accidental deaths accounting for the rest.Guns were responsible for almost 85 percent of all teen homicides that year, the researchers added. They were also the most common method of teen suicide. SUICIDE LINKThe high death rate in suicide attempts using guns - compared to pills or sharp objects - makes at-home access to firearms especially dangerous for impulsive teens, according to the pediatrician group.""For 98 percent of families every year, whether you have a gun or not is irrelevant. Most of the time nothing happens, the way that most of the time when you ride around without a seat belt, nothing bad happens,"" said David Hemenway, head of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in Boston. He was not involved in drafting the policy statement.The AAP committee also called for restoration of a controversial U.S. ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004. President Barack Obama suggested at a presidential debate earlier this week that he would renew a ban on assault weapons - a position not backed by his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.Assault weapons include military-style guns designed to fire rapidly and from close range, such as semiautomatic AK-47s.The AAP cited the cost of gun-related assaults and homicides at over $17 billion a year, due to lost productivity and medical bills. But Hemenway said the true financial burden is much higher.""When guns are used for homicide it can destroy not only someone's life and their ability to work and so forth ... but it can destroy communities,"" he said. For example, businesses do not want to move into communities that have had a few shootings, and families that can afford to will move out.He said the consensus among injury researchers has been that the best thing to do for a child's safety is to keep guns out of the house. But each family has to make that decision on its own.""If you decide to have a gun, and it's an individual choice, what you really want to do is store it safely,"" Hemenway said."

But recently, there seems to be more attention being paid to one item that is being stockpiled: incandescent lightbulbs.That’s right, since the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act was passed which will phase-out certain wattages, people are buying boxes and boxes of 40 to 100-watt bulbs in preparation for the day when they will no longer be available. Take Detroit resident Karen DeCoster, who over the past month has become famous for hoarding lightbulbs and being the main crusader against the Act. She recently told Gizmodo that it is a government attack on civilization. ""It's a condemnation of our standard of living, and an attack on human comfort, with the ban of one of civilization's stellar inventions,” she said. DeCoster currently owns 400 to 500 bulbs between 60 and 100-watts. And she’s not alone.Michael Jubinsky of Maine also believes the phase-out is about politics. According to the Press Herald, Jubinsky owns about 50 packages of lightbulbs. But it’s not just a political issue for these hoarders. Back in 2011 the New York Times interviewed designers and decorators who were acquiring large amounts of incadescents because they prefer the coloring to compact fluorescent lights. By 2014 the 100, 75, 60 and 40-watt bulbs will no longer be produced in America but consumers will have the options to buy halogen incandescent bulbs, which use less energy. The real surprising aspect of this is how quickly people feel the need to buy products in mass when they fear it will no longer be available, even though the new bulbs are better for the environment. It has us wondering what household item will become the next hoarding craze?Have something to say? Check out HuffPost Home on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram. "

Fungal spores can enter the lungs of these patients and make their way into the blood stream, and eventually into the central nervous system.In the case described by the team at Johns Hopkins, the injection was the woman's first, and she had no medical history of having a compromised immune system, nor was she taking any long-term medications.Doctors found nothing and sent her home, but the woman returned the next day with more severe symptoms and was admitted to the hospital, where doctors tried a series of antibiotics and other drugs as the woman continued to decline.Tests for a host of infections, including herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus which causes chicken pox and shingles, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and West Nile virus, were all negative, as were tests for cryptococcal fungi, a known cause of fungal meningitis.The woman died 10 days after being admitted to hospital, the same day the team found evidence of Exserohilum in her spinal fluid. An autopsy showed massive tissue death in the brain stem, inflammation in the blood vessels and evidence of a stroke.Based on the case, the researchers urged doctors to be aware of the signs and symptoms of fungal meningitis and to seek rapid diagnosis and treatment to prevent ""serious complications and deaths"".The CDC advises patients who feel ill and are concerned they were injected with one of the recalled products to contact their physician.Symptoms of fungal meningitis include new or worsening headache, fever, sensitivity to light, stiff neck, weakness or numbness in any part of your body, slurred speech, increased pain, redness or swelling at the injection site.

It's not surprising though. Most people -- including many in the medical field -- have never heard of this type of cancer. IBC is a rare form of the disease, accounting for only 1-5 percent of all breast cancer cases. But this 1 percent cancer quickly became much more than that for me and my family.The first time I came across this particularly nasty type of breast cancer was when I did a quick Google search of my symptoms, which included a swollen, red breast and pitted skin. I thought I had a summer rash, or, in a worst-case scenario, mastitis (a breast infection), potentially caused by a blocked milk duct. Though I had stopped nursing a while back, my youngest daughter was 16 months old at the time, so it felt like a likely possibility. But what I found when I conducted that memorable search online was Inflammatory Breast Cancer. It is a rare and aggressive form of the disease and is unique in that it presents itself with symptoms such as redness, swelling and tenderness in the breast and pitting of the skin. The cancer grows in sheets and often there is no lump. No lump?! Worse yet, mammograms often can not detect this scary disease -- though at age 34 and with little family history of cancer, I hadn't yet had a mammogram anyway. IBC is diagnosed by its clinical presentation, ultrasounds, MRIs and biopsies. By nature, Inflammatory Breast Cancer is diagnosed at a late stage, either Stage III or IV, as the cancer has already invaded the skin. There is no early detection for IBC. And the prognosis, survival and recurrence rates for this type of cancer are much worse than typical breast cancer. The five-year survival rate for IBC is somewhere between 25-50 percent. I knew immediately that this rare form of cancer was what I had, and prayed that I was wrong. But I wasn't. After a whirlwind week of testing, I was diagnosed with Stage IV IBC in September 2011. The cancer had metastasized to one spot on my spine and to two lymph nodes. I was devastated and in shock. A Stage IV diagnosis is pretty much the worst you can get. I was ""fortunate"" that the cancer hadn't spread far and was relatively contained, making me what I refer to as ""barely stage IV"" and what doctors call oligometastatic. My oncologist recommended we move forward with an aggressive treatment plan with a ""curative intent."" There was no need to convince me. With two little girls (aged 4 and 1 at the time), a loving husband, family and friends and so much to live for, I was all in and ready to throw everything at this monster that we could. A cure at Stage IV is rare, at best. But, I figured with my odds being what they were already, I might have a shot... and perhaps I should head to Vegas as well.I started chemotherapy a week after I was diagnosed, less than two weeks after I first heard about IBC. I soon had surgery to implant a Port-A-Cath in my chest, a device used to easily access a vein. My first set of chemo drugs was harsh, and I got infusions every other week for eight weeks. I shaved my head. I lost my hair. I moved on to a different set of drugs with a weekly regiment for 12 weeks. And in January, I was thrilled to have a scan show the mass in my breast was almost completely gone and my nodes and spinal tumor no longer lit up the screen. The chemo/prayers/support/positivity combo seemed to be working! So, I went with my family on a spur-of-the-moment trip to Disney World to soak up some magic before my surgery. I stopped chemo in preparation for my upcoming mastectomy, but a routine cardiac echo found a 2-centimeter clot in my heart caused by my port tube. Surgery was delayed and we watched the clot to see what it would do. There were other complications, bumps in the road, but I remained on chemo every three out of four weeks through September while we kept an eye on the clot, so I had a full year on chemo. During that time, I continued working as I had all year. I took vacations with my family and friends, started growing back my hair, had a great summer and felt almost normal for a while. The clot remained stable and it was finally safe to move forward with my single mastectomy. My surgery was on Sept. 19. I am recovering well, and the great news is that my pathology report showed no residual cancer!I am now gearing up to move onto the next stage in my treatment: daily radiation for about seven weeks. They will zap my spine for 10 sessions and my chest wall for 33. Even though I appear cancer-free, we are not taking any chances. The radiation should mop up any lingering cells the chemo or surgery failed to get. Because radiation comes after surgery with an IBC diagnosis, reconstruction surgery is not recommended for another year or so. And through radiation and beyond, I will continue my targeted therapy of Herceptin infusions, a relatively-new antibody that my oncologist believes saved my life. I will take it indefinitely, or until it stops working for me. Or until there's a cure for cancer.I am part of an online group of others with IBC. And through this group I have received so much support and understanding that really only others with the same diagnosis can provide. But the dark side, the painful side, of belonging to this close-knit group of strangers is hearing when treatment has failed someone or the cancer has progressed or that there is nothing left for the doctors to try. This cancer is ruthless and doesn't discriminate. Young mothers, grandmothers, wives and friends have been taken far too soon from this beast of a cancer. My response to treatment so far has been truly amazing, but it's not the norm, and it's not guaranteed to stick. Recurrence rates for IBC are high, particularly within the first two years of diagnosis. My IBC sisters with progressing disease -- riddling their brains, their lungs, their livers -- were often in my situation only a short while ago.The pinking of October has brought much awareness to breast cancer, but this rare form is still largely unknown and is often believed to be under-reported due to its late diagnosis. So many will never hear of this disease until it impacts their lives. Be vigilant about changes in your or your partner's body. Be your own advocate when you know that something isn't right. And please help spread awareness by telling someone you know about IBC -- it could save a life. Because this 1 percent cancer is so much more to people like me.

When kids begin to nag, especially in public, it's easy to give in. Why? Many times, it's because appeasing our kids instantaneously quiets the problem. The reality is, giving in to those situations is like plugging a hole in the Hoover Dam with your finger.Many families use the excuse that it's just not worth the guaranteed fight when it comes to giving into the ""nag factor,"" as I call it. In my experiences working with families, I discovered that the root of why parents won't say ""no"" can go much deeper.One family having a tough time with their nagging children had actually gone into major debt just to appease their kids. I couldn't believe it. Surely telling their children ""no"" couldn't have been as painful as a having a conversation with their creditors. We talked through the issues and eventually got to the center of the problem: They told me that they would consider themselves bad parents if they didn't say yes to the kids. ""Good parents work hard so that their kids don't have to go without anything,"" they said.I was stunned. I explained that being good parents means that your children are provided with love, shelter, food, clothing, education and values. It also means teaching your kids financial responsibility. These ideas might not always be popular with the younger ones so you need to be tactful. Telling your children, ""I'm teaching you to be financially responsible!"" won't get through, so it's no surprise they'd rather have the coveted toy. But parents, you need to stay strong and you'll be a much better parent in the long run.As you hold your ground, beware of the ""fairness doctrine"" counterattack: ""Mommmm, it's not fair, it's just not fair."" This is the standard first reaction from the kids. Cliché as it may be, life isn't fair, and I promise you'll do your children a disservice if you prolong the time they aren't aware of this.Children will nag; it's in their nature. We parents feel bad not giving in, and that's in our nature. It's all OK. I'm sure we all wanted our parents to give into our requests when we were younger, but take comfort in the fact that, difficult as it may be, you have the foresight of your children in mind; they don't. You're not alone in wanting to be good parents in your eyes and your children's at the same time.  Nag me once, shame on you. Nag me twice, shame on me.Here are three tips to help you avoid the nagging:1. Create and stick to a shopping list. Let your kids participate in the shopping experience. Start by creating a list with your kids. While you're still at home, remind them you will only buy the items you put on the list. Then assign each child an item that he or she will be responsible for remembering to get at the store. Make it clear that you won't add any other items to the cart when you are at the store.2. Allow your kids to buy one item with their own money. As part of my allowance system, I teach that a set portion of each week's allowance should be put aside specifically for instant gratification spending, which I call ""quick cash."" When my son Rhett would nag me for an impulse purchase that I thought was okay for him to have, I would ask him if he could afford it because he has to pay for it himself out of his quick cash. I would also remind him that he doesn't get any more quick cash until his next ""pay day."" Upon hearing that, he sometimes said, ""I have to pay for that myself? Never mind, I guess I don't want it that much."" I have some great stories about putting the power of the decision in our kids' hands and will write more in the coming weeks about how to get kids to understand and use quick cash in any household.As parents and grandparents, it is our job to remind our kids to take their quick cash with them when we go out. It's as easy as putting the money in a plastic bag and finding some room in your purse or your child's backpack.3. Just say no. ""No"" is a perfectly acceptable word. Painful, I know, but effective. We have to say ""no,"" and we have to mean it. Be brave enough to be able to endure an embarrassing scene. Also, consistency is key. If your children know that no really means no, they won't be as tempted to nag as they will know their efforts will be in vain.  Do you have a horror story about your kids nagging you? How about a funny one? Please share it with us below."

Does your spouse have a relationship with someone that makes you feel uncomfortable? He or she may flatly deny any inappropriate interactions.

You try to tell yourself that sex, touching or kissing isn't part of what they do together, but your instincts say something else.More often than not, you feel anxious, depressed and angry. You feel incredibly deceived. You have started doing things you never dreamed of -- snooping, accessing private emails, phone records and credit card bills. You search your spouse's computer or phone for any telltale signs that something is amiss.Then it happens. You discover personal emails. Too personal. Or a series of late night calls. Maybe the person's name appears on your spouse's buddy list. And although some of the exchanges are work-related, there's more than a tinge of familiarity. Your heart beats. You're concerned.You start questioning your spouse. She or he swears that nothing physical is going on and after much convincing, you want to believe it. Yet you can't forget that there are the lunches, after-hour meetings and intimate conversations. You remember something you read about ""emotional affairs"" and you now feel certain that your spouse is right smack dab in the middle of one.So you tell your spouse of your concern. You're extremely unhappy about that relationship. You don't like it one bit. ""It might not be physical,"" you tell your spouse, but you find it extremely threatening. You don't want your spouse being intimate with another person in any way, shape or form. It hurts and you consider it betrayal.Your spouse becomes defensive and insists that nothing inappropriate is going on. ""I know my boundaries. I am not having an affair, so you're wrong and I want you to stop nagging me about this. You're overreacting.""But are you?In the three decades that I have been specializing in couples' therapy, I have watched the destruction caused by emotional affairs. Even if two people are not engaged in a physical relationship, the emotional attachment can threaten the very foundation and fabric of the marriage. Here are a few reasons why:Betrayal is in the eye of the beholder. Often, people who have close extramarital relationships feel perfectly justified as long as it isn't sexual. Then there is no betrayal, no threat to the marriage. However, if their spouses think otherwise and feel hurt, threatened or emotionally abandoned, it becomes a marital problem. And as with any marital problem, partners need to protect each other's feelings. This means that the emotionally involved partner should honor the feelings of his or her spouse whether he or she agrees with or understands it completely. Mutual caretaking is what loving relationships are all about. It's essential to remember that betrayal is unquestionably in the eye of the beholder.Having close ""friends"" can be a slippery slope. Here's an example: A completely innocent meeting after work with co-workers may result in two people becoming excited about a mutual project. They end up spending a great deal of time together at work and the relationship becomes increasingly comfortable and familiar. Soon, they start having lunches together and when the work load increases, there are more demands on their time and efforts to complete the project. They stay later at work and go out to dinner.Eventually, conversations shift from business to life outside work. Over time, these talks get more and more personal. Occasionally, people discover that they can talk about certain subjects with their co-worker that they cannot talk about with their spouses. An intimate bond begins to form.Then, conversations become even more intimate. Frequently, they share their unhappiness with their own marriages. They commiserate and validate each others' feelings and become confidantes. Their communication defines their relationship as special and separate from their respective marriages.The relationship may get physical at this point. But even if it doesn't, the real nature of the relationship is kept secret. Secrets place marriages at risk of divorce.As you can see by this example, the relationship started out completely innocent. But the small daily choices they made led to a connection that wasn't so innocent. An emotional affair takes time and energy away from marriage. There is just so much time in a day, and people have finite energy in their lives. If the focus in one's life is the ""other"" person, time and energy are drained from the marriage. Plus, if a partner is getting emotional needs met outside the marriage, there is little need to connect at home. This leads to emotional distance and growing apart. Marriages are living things and they require attention.Emotional affairs may be misconstrued. Sometimes, one person is more emotionally involved in the relationship than the other. Perhaps he or she is hoping that the emotional relationship will flourish into something even more meaningful. That person might even be hoping that the other will eventually leave his or her marriage and become involved on a very deep level. This can happen without the other person's awareness. Their intentions might be pure -- to help out a person in distress, to be a loyal friend, or to simply have a fulfilling platonic, appropriate relationship. But one can never predict how the other person interprets interactions and exchanges. To avoid misunderstandings of any sort, it is essential to have boundaries in relationships outside marriage. This way, no one will be hurt or misled.If your spouse is having an emotional affair, stop nagging, spying or haranguing. I wrote this post for you to give to your partner. It may or may not alter your spouse's behavior, but it least it will be food for thought.And if you are someone whose spouse is complaining about a relationship you may be having, taking your spouse's feelings into account will make life much more pleasant for you and it just might save your marriage!To learn more about Michele and her Divorce Busting practice, visit her on the web at http://www.divorcebusting.com/ or follow her on Facebook."

There are dramatic landscapes from the Kalahari's desert plains to the Okavango's lush waterways. In addition to huge national parks covering a variety of eco-systems and millions of animals, Botswana has a strong record of wildlife management and conservation and has prioritized eco-friendly, up-market, low -volume tourism. This means that travelers can enjoy uncrowded access to remote and unspoiled wilderness. Decades of political stability and good infrastructure just add to Botswana appeal.The Okavango DeltaOne of the most popular and iconic destinations in Botswana is the Okavango Delta, the earth's largest inland water system. Its headwaters start in Angola's western highlands where tributaries join to form the Cubango River. It then flows through Namibia where it is called the Kavango and finally enters Botswana, where it becomes the Okavango. Millions of years ago the Okavango River flowed into a large inland lake called Lake Makgadikgadi (pronounced Ma·kga·di·kga·di now Makgadikgadi Pans). Tectonic shifts interrupted the flow of the river forming what is now the Okavango Delta, a unique system of waterways that supports a vast array of animal and plant life, in what would have otherwise been dry Kalahari savannah.Today, the Delta is a beautiful and complex combination of permanent waterways, seasonal swamps and floodplain grasslands which experience significant changes in water levels over the course of the year. These changes impact where travelers can stay and the activities that are available. For example, some camps that are accessible only by boat during certain times of year are able to offer game drives at other times. Because of these seasonal variations and depending on the experience you are looking for, here is an attempt to explain the Okavango's flooding cycles to give you some idea of where to stay and when.The Okavango's Seasonal FloodsThe Okavango receives water from two different sources at two different times of the year. The first is the annual seasonal flood which is caused by rainwater flowing slowly from the Angolan highlands caused by Angola's rainy season and the second is Botswana's own rain season. Both rainy seasons run from roughly December to March with the rains in Botswana generally starting a bit later than those in Angola. The rains in Angola are heavier than in Botswana and they flow into a huge catchment area that is the source of the Okavango River, making them a larger contributor to the seasonal floods.The rain that falls in Angola in December slowly makes its way down the Okavango River in a flood-tide that arrives in the upper parts of the Delta's panhandle in February and March. As the flood travels down the river bed of the panhandle, it overflows its banks, revitalizing the swamps and covering the sandbanks. On reaching the fan-shaped Delta, it spreads out, overflowing river channels covering floodplains and slowly raising the water level in lagoons and backwaters. The flood's front moves slowly, less than a mile per day because of the Delta's shallow gradient and because the water is slowed by swamp vegetation. It takes 4 months for the incoming floods to travel the 155 miles from Mohembo in northern Botswana to Maun and the floodwater reaches the southern half of the Delta in the middle of Botswana's ""dry"" season (approximately August).The floods subside and the water levels recede during the summer and, in the very hot and dry months of September and October, dust and airborne sand particles create spectacular sunsets. The water recedes in stages from October through March when the rains have started again in Angola and floods begin to creep down again. So I know this sounds horribly complicated, but what it boils down to is: moving southwest from the mouth of the Okavango River into the Delta areas are all more or less covered in water on a seasonal cycle. This means that camps in these areas are more land or water-based and offer different activities at different times of the year. Water-based activities include mokoro (wooden canoe) and motorized boat rides while land activities include game-drives. When To Visit The Delta?It is most commonly held that between July to October offers the best wildlife viewing opportunities because when it is dry animals are forced to concentrate near available water. The predators simply wait for the prey animals to come to drink. However, the rainy season (December through March) should not be overlooked, not least because of the great deals that can be found. Photographically and aesthetically, the colors of the Delta are richer during the rains with the lush green growth and dramatic and stormy skies in the background. In addition many grazing animals have their babies during the rainy season to take advantage of the abundance of grass and this means more predator activity.RememberAll the advice I can offer is an approximation, its NATURE! Water levels in the Delta are affected by variations yearly rainfall in Angola and Botswana as well as a cycle of inflows and flooding of the Okavango and associated river systems. Rainfall in a given year in the Angola catchment can range from range from 20 to 70 inches a year and the rains that fall over Botswana can contribute between 2 and 45% of the seasonal flood's total volume. These short term changes based on rainfall in a given year as well as longer terms changes to the water flow in the Delta over years and even decades will affect what properties we recommend and can make it challenging (and time consuming) for you to pick the best properties on your own!Building a TripThere is a great experience to be had in the Delta at all times of year, what will change is where you stay in the Delta to get a combination of water and land-based activities. In general, we recommend two days at a water-based camp followed by three days at a camp that will offer more game-drives and the chance to see the big five. The water camp will be a unique and remote experience and you will see some really unique animals. Then at a land camp you will get a more classic, big-five safari experience. If you have even more time, adding another land camp in a different part of the Delta, the Linyanti/Savute area, or a visit to the Kalahari or the salt pans will show you all the dramatic contrasts in landscapes and eco-systems that Botswana has to offer.
