That word is TANTRUM.,2014-03-13,"Bunmi Laditan - Author, <em>The Honest Toddler: A Child's Guide to Life</em>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ca4fb8d2400002001067359.png?ops=100_100,"Hello. I'm the Honest Toddler. For those of you who are not familiar with my work, I am an ambassador between the toddler and adult communities. My passion is helping adults become better servants to the small children in their lives. Over the next few weeks I'll be sharing my wisdom with you. Our first lesson will cover the topic of Toddler ""Tantrums."" Let us begin.The Honest Toddler Guide to TantrumsThere's a very dirty word commonly used to describe the mild outbursts of reasonable emotion that toddlers display from time to time. That word is TANTRUM. Not only is this descriptor condescending, it releases the party responsible (YOU) for said ""tantrum.""  Wrong: Oh, my child is throwing a tantrum. I'll just stand here with arms folded like a despot and wait for it to pass.Right: My blessing is lying on her back in this crowded restaurant, screaming and trying to kick everyone within roundhouse distance. I wonder how I failed her?Do you see how language creates toddler bias? From now on, we'll be throwing the word ""tantrum"" in the metaphorical outside trash and replacing it with ""loud response.""Research Assignment: Go out into the field and observe loud responses firsthand in order to get a sense of why and how they occur. A popular place for scouting is the grocery store between 4 and 5:30 p.m. While you're most likely to find an outburst occurring in nearly every aisle, for the best lessons, visit the cereal/snack/chip lane. The market is a land mine for parent/toddler conflict due to overuse of the dirty word ""NO."" Also, most people don't realize this, but green vegetables emit a field of negative energy that contributes to the sadness and rage children feel while food shopping.""But I need to run errands!"" That's fantastic. Go on your own time. There isn't a toddler in the world who wants to accompany you on a 36-store whirlwind of boring. The worst part about running errands is that actual running is discouraged. And you're never rushing out to pick up Popsicles or glow sticks; it's mostly dry cleaning and cupboard liners.You already know that loud responses are your fault. There is another toddler phenomenon that you bring upon yourself. Deadweight, otherwise known as Going Boneless, is when your toddler opens a valve within his or her brain that converts hard bone minerals into bubble gum and increases their body weight by 70 to 80 percent.When toddlers Go Boneless, they can't hear the world around them. Only harps and angels. And the angels are saying, ""Stay down, baby, stay down."" Don't bother making ice cream promises. It's too late for that. Activating deadweight is very simple. Every toddler has his unique style, but I prefer a straightforward, classic approach.How It Starts: 1. Slow motion: Your toddler will begin walking as if each step is physically painful. I like to thrust my shoulders forward, causing my knuckles to graze the ground.2. Verbal indicators: ""I'm tired. I can't walk."" Did you hear that? You are now at a crossroads. Smart parents will immediately pick up their toddler and find the nearest Cinnabon. Stubborn parents will soon be humiliated in public. Saying things like ""C'mon, let's go, we're almost there"" feels like a slap in the face to the child, who you say means something to you.BAM! It'll be sudden. You'll look back and spot your child on the ground. First, you'll be shocked; your eyes will dart around to see if anyone is watching. Oh, trust me, they are.The only solution is to airlift your toddler out. Your child is no longer capable of using her muscles. You broke them when you broke her trust. Be sure to support your toddler's flopping head.Remember: This is your doing.Homework: (1) Practice running errands online. (2) Next time you're out of the house and your child's legs stop working, immediately rush to his side and pick him up. If you have too many bags to hold or a stroller, leave everything in the street.You're on your way to becoming a better parent! Remember: Asking your Facebook friends, family, or looking to Supernanny for advice is a waste of time. These people don't know your life. The above is an excerpt from The Honest Toddler: A Child's Guide to Parenting, out in paperback April 22, 2014.Also on HuffPost:"

The ""war"" I'm referring to is an attitude of conflict and animosity toward a person, object, or condition. Parents can feel at war with a misbehaving teenager, and certainly vice versa. Neighbors quarreling over a fence. Spouses edging toward divorce. Divorced parents continuing to battle over holidays. Someone stuck in traffic, at war with other drivers. Ideologues reviling the other side. Kicking the chair after stubbing a toe against it.The summer when I was 16, I worked as a camp counselor beside the Pacific Ocean, and there was a lot of skin diving (without scuba gear) into the forests of kelp. One time I foolishly swam into a thicket of kelp, thinking there was clear water just on the other side, but there was only more seaweed, with thick orangish leaves and long strong vines reaching up from the seabed below. I was trapped, running out of air, and began to panic. I battled the kelp, thrashing and jerking, which only wrapped it more tightly around me. After I don't know how long, a clarity came over me and my war with the kelp ended. My diving mask was around my throat, my snorkel ripped out of my mouth, and I'd lost a fin. I slowly disentangled myself from the kelp rather than fighting it, working my way upward, finally clearing it, seeing the bright silver surface of the ocean above my head, and rising up to it and then the precious air.We need to be able to stand up for ourselves, deal with tough things -- including nearly drowning -- and change what's wrong and uphold what's right. But when we do this while also caught in anger like a swimmer caught in kelp, that's not good for us or others. A mind at war feels bad, full of irritation and fear. The body revves up, accumulating the gradual wear and tear of stress activation. Perceptions and beliefs get biased and defended. Reactions are turbocharged. All this prompts others to go to war with us, which then drives vicious cycles.Getting caught in the mind of war is understandable and all too normal. The capacity and sometimes inclination to go to war are a part of human nature (amidst many other parts, including empathy, restraint, altruism, and love). Next, this part of a person is shaped further by culture, economic hardship, childhood, and life experiences. Then psychological factors get involved, such as identifying with your ""case"" against others, vengeance, holding onto grievances, or a general mood of reproach.But whatever its causes, still, a mind at war is the responsibility of the person who has it.How?Recognize the causes. Be aware of the emotional payoffs in being at war, and the inner justifications. How did your approach to conflict get influenced by your upbringing and life experiences? Do you go to war because you don't know another way? As you understand these causes more deeply, they'll have less power over you.Recognize when you've slid into war mode. Notice the tension and activation in the body, the righteousness and rigidity in the mind, the tangles of recurring conflicts with others. Be very aware of the experience and the impact on others, including innocent bystanders such as children. Considering all these costs, ask yourself: Do I really want to be at war here? Then make a choice. This moment of sincere choice is key. Without it, the momentum of war takes on a life of its own.Pick a particular situation and imagine being strong and taking care of things without going to war, without throwing the hot coals that burn both others and yourself. How could you be firm and clear without slipping into righteousness or antagonism? Imagine someone who embodies this combination of strength, moral confidence, self-control, and non-reactivity to the warlikeness of others (two models for me are Martin Luther King, Jr. and Aung San Suu Kyi). Imagine how this person might act in your situation, and see if you could be more like this yourself.Take care of your real interests as best you can. If appropriate, try to repair with the other person (""non-violent communication"" is a good approach). But if the other person ignores or punishes your efforts at repair, that's not a good sign. Then if you can, name and try to repair the lack of repair -- and if this effort is blocked as well, that's a really bad sign. You may need to shrink the relationship -- at least inside your own mind, if you can't do this outside in the world -- to the scale that is trustworthy and safe for you.Bottom line, look to the war as it happens inside you rather than getting swirled into the accusations, positions, threats, and recriminations around you. See the suffering in the other people and yourself, and see if you can have compassion for all parties. The world outside may not change. But if you end the war in your own head, you'll feel better and act better. Which just might help the world around you to change for the better as well.Rick Hanson, Ph.D., is a neuropsychologist and New York Times best-selling author.

But, some of you may remember I went ""off"" coffee and caffeine for my trip, so I never got a chance to drink one while I was there. (Don't worry; I won't make that mistake again.)Once back in the States and back on the black fuel, I learned about an Aussie coffee shop a few blocks from my office in Manhattan. The talk in the office was more about the cute baristas than about the coffee, but just the mention of Australia is often enough to get me out and about. And so, I went out one day for an afternoon cup at Bluestone Lane Coffee...The first sip of my first Flat White was...revelatory. Deeply, deeply satisfying. Such silkiness, such balance of milk and espresso, such richness and flavor mixed together in a blend of smooth and velvety goodness. Sigh. I was hooked.I normally drink my coffee black, but the way the milk is whipped and frothed, it's not ""milky."" And yet it makes for a gentler afternoon cup--the milky velvet soothes some of the bitterness usually found with espresso. For the record, a Flat White is two shots of espresso combined with milk that is frothed just so. It is NOT a latte! It is also not sweet. It doesn't need sugar.But it is powerful stuff. I took a coworker who normally doesn't drink an afternoon cup of coffee for one, and she ended up singing ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt"" all afternoon. Good times! I confess I joined in.So, I've been on a mission ever since. Laura Thierer, a wonderful woman who works in our cafeteria in Pennsylvania, has learned how to make a Flat White for me--all organic! AHHHHH! She sees me coming between 1:30 and 3:00 on any given workday and knows exactly what I want; I adore her.And just this past weekend, I stopped at a Starbucks on my way home from New York (exit 33 on I-78) and a lovely young lady attempted to make one for me. It wasn't perfect, but it was almost there. And the joy she took in trying--and I took in drinking it--was beyond wonderful. As I left, she promised she'd keep working on it so that next time it would be even better.Oh, I'll be back. I'll be back. Flat White, I love you.For more from Maria Rodale, visit www.mariasfarmcountrykitchen.com"

These are their views, not ours, but we welcome your responses.Today, one man shares how he's tackling one of the biggest debts many of us will ever take on: a mortgage. August 1, 2012, will forever be a day etched in my memory.It was the day my lifelong dream of being a homeowner finally came true, and I moved into a beautifully renovated three-bedroom bungalow in the suburbs of Toronto, Ontario.I purchased my home for $425,000, and through all my years of hard work and financial discipline, I was able to make a sizable down payment of $170,000, which left me with a five-year fixed rate mortgage of $255,000 at 3.04 percent.Six digits of debt are intimidating, especially when you're a single homeowner. But at 29 years old and just 15 months after buying my house, I've already paid $100,000 off my mortgage.. and I plan to pay the other $155,000 off before I turn 31.How did I do it? Let me explain.A House Starts With a DreamEver since I was 10 years old, I've dreamed of being a homeowner. That's when I was sitting at the dining room table at my mother's house and heard that my aunt, who had lived paycheck to paycheck and rented an apartment her whole life, had been laid off from her job after 20 years and would have to move in with my grandmother. There was no way I ever wanted to find myself in that situation, middle-aged and unemployed with no savings in the bank.So I started saving toward my first home even before I graduated from university. While in school, I worked three part-time jobs (meat department clerk at a supermarket, administrative assistant at my university's MBA office and freelance writer), earning over $10,000 annually. Instead of taking summers off, I worked full time as an administrative assistant in a government office, earning another $10,000 per summer, enough to cover the next year's tuition. After a 60-hour workweek I was exhausted, but I knew I wanted to graduate debt-free.RELATED: 7 Federal Student Loan Repayment Options: What You Need to KnowI've always been a saver, so frugality was second nature to me. I purchased my textbooks secondhand, cycled and rode public transit. I limited myself to coffee once a week with friends and only went out when it benefited my career. Food is a major expense for students, so packing my lunch was a no-brainer -- I estimate that saved me at least $5,000 a year. I graduated university debt-free, with a net worth of $70,000.(I should mention here that while universities are similar to those found in the U.S., post-secondary education is a lot more affordable here in Canada -- while a private university could cost $200,000 in the U.S., the cost of a similar four-year degree in Canada would be more like $80,000.)RELATED: How I Did It: Applied for 100 ScholarshipsAfter eight months of working in a supermarket post-graduation, I was fortunate to land a full-time job in the financial industry, earning $32,000. I opened an investment account and started contributing $250 weekly toward investing in mutual funds to save for my home. I was a disciplined saver -- even after graduation I continued to live like a student in the basement of my mother's home, paying $600 a month in rent. Through my full-time and part-time jobs and my freelance work, I was able to save an additional $110,000, bringing my net worth to $180,000, in only two and a half years.First-Time Homebuyer.. and First-Time LandlordThe most difficult part of becoming a homeowner wasn't saving toward my down payment -- it was purchasing a home in a seller's market. After nearly two years of house hunting and the same number of failed offers, I started to wonder if I should put my dreams of homeownership on hold. I was in danger of being priced out of the market as home prices climbed faster than my savings.RELATED: What's Happening in Real Estate in 2014In the September after graduation, even before I landed my salaried job, I was sitting on the couch at my parents' house, watching HGTV's Income Property with my mom like I did every Thursday night, when I had an idea: To achieve my dream of owning a home and paying down the mortgage as soon as possible, I would follow in the footsteps of host Scott McGillivray -- who lived in the basement of his first house for eight years to get financially ahead -- and rent out the main floor of my future home. Now I just needed to find that home!After three years of house hunting, I finally found it in June 2012. It was love at first sight: a newly renovated, one-story bungalow with a basement apartment in a great location near Lake Ontario, only 15 minutes from my parents. I was fortunate to avoid what I dreaded most, a bidding war, as the seller was moving to Alberta and wanted to sell quickly. The seller accepted my offer of $425,000, and two months later, I rented a moving truck and moved in my worldly possessions. After a grueling day of moving and unpacking, I stood in the living room, admiring my new house and staring out the bay window. The journey of becoming a homeowner was tough, but at that moment, it was well worth it.RELATED: So You Say You Want to Be a LandlordI hadn't abandoned my original plan: I would live in the basement and rent the main floor in order to pay off my mortgage. My real estate agent was nice enough to help show my property to prospective tenants in July 2012, before I even moved in, and soon I had rented out the house. I've been very lucky: My tenants, first a young couple around my age and now a family, have been great.Paying Down My Mortgage -- at All CostsI currently work as a pension analyst at a pension consulting firm, earning $48,825 a year. On the weekends I work part time at a supermarket, earning $10,000 a year. I also have a freelance writing business, and 2013 was my most successful year ever -- I earned over $20,000. I currently rent the main floor of my house for $1,550 per month.My family and friends often wonder why I am so determined to pay off my mortgage so quickly, since it's technically ""good debt."" Besides my mortgage, I'm debt-free. Paying down my mortgage provides me with a guaranteed rate of return (unlike the stock market), and as a single homeowner, if I ever lose my job, I won't have to worry about my mortgage -- and the rent from upstairs will be more than enough to cover my household expenses.I've taken full advantage of mortgage prepayment privileges (many closed mortgages allow you to pay an annual, penalty-free percentage ahead of time, to cut down on interest). I've doubled up my mortgage payments, paying $850 weekly, made lump sum payments whenever I received checks for freelance writing income and increased my mortgage payments 15 percent each year. Last year I managed to max out my mortgage prepayment privileges in only four months.When it comes to spending money, I've continued to be frugal. By cycling and taking public transit to work, I've been able to save over $6,000 a year, which is the real cost of owning a car, according to personal finance columnist Rob Carrick. I don't have a mobile phone (I use MagicJack Plus, an internet-based telephone service, instead) or cable (I stream TV shows via online Canadian websites like www.cbc.ca and www.ctv.ca), which saves me about $1,800 annually.Today, I have a net worth of $450,000, which includes my house, investments, emergency fund and retirement savings. If all goes according to plan, I will be mortgage-free by age 31. For me, that means the weight of the world will be lifted off my shoulders, and I'll have the freedom to pursue my other passions -- like freelance writing full time, or penning a personal finance book to share my experiences with others -- and be able to start saving toward my next goal: retiring early at age 55.Sean Cooper resides in Toronto, Ontario. He is a personal finance freelance writer and blogger who writes about pensions, retirement, real estate and mortgages.This story originally appeared on LearnVest: How I Paid $100,000 Off My Mortgage in Under 2 YearsMore From LearnVest How Much House Can You Afford? 7 Secrets to Launching a Lucrative Side Gig How I Finally Paid Off a Lifetime of Credit Card DebtLearnVest is a program for your money.

It seems that this perennially popular look is gaining more and more fans by the minute!As I mentioned in my post on trends in luxury kitchen cabinets, the white of today's kitchen is a crisp, bright white, rather than the softer ivory or off-white tones used in the past. I love the timeless quality of the white kitchen. It's versatile and fits just about any style and space. Below are some of my favorite reasons to use white in a kitchen and examples of how different materials, fixtures, details and finishes can be employed to transform the style from traditional to modern.Great for large and small spaces:Whether you're working with the compact layout of an urban high rise or the more open space of a suburban residence or vacation home, a white kitchen is a great option. White can help open up a smaller space and make it feel larger and brighter. In a more amply proportioned kitchen, white creates a fresh, clean and invigorating feeling. Modern white kitchens:White is perfect for a streamlined, modern aesthetic; it reads ""minimalism."" I love using high gloss or lacquered white finishes in modern kitchens because it looks fantastic when combined with sleek hardware, glass, or even polished nickel finishes. Transitional White Kitchens:White also works wonderfully in transitional kitchens. I often use natural materials such as marble and agate to introduce white into a transitional design. Painted white cabinets lend a more organic sense to these kitchens and help bridge the gap between modern and classic.Perfect for High Contrast: White provides the perfect counterpoint to any other color yielding a high contrast for optimal visual impact. For example, bright white cabinets offset by a burgundy La Cornue island highlight the vibrancy of that focal piece. Another touch of drama: Try dark wood cabinetry, such as a fumed oak or rich walnut, framing high definition white. It's a bold look that will help emphasize the rich tones present in the wood grain. Pit white against any other single color and that sharp contrast will always result in a winning look.  Even the Oven:You don't have to take my word that white is white hot. Appliance manufacturers are now rolling out units with a bright white finish as a fresh alternative to stainless steel. Miele's Brilliant White Plus line, is just one example. The white glass fronted ovens and warming drawers in this series are an elegant addition to any kitchen.Photo credit: MieleThe white kitchen is a classic style that will endure in the years to come. For my part, I know I will continue innovating how I interpret it, and develop novel ways of expressing sleek and elegant designs in this one-note palette."

How can you have a plan specific to your finances? Can you really separate your financial plan from your life plan? When the question in the title is asked like this, our brain goes from our life to our finances, immediately narrowing the scope of our thoughts and vision.For example, you could be walking down the street minding your own business, thinking about the great and wonderful things you have planned for your life, your career and your family, and then some jackass comes along and asks you about your financial plan. Your answer may sound something like this:I actually don't know. I have a bunch of things going on right now. I have bills to pay and debt to manage. My retirement account is out there somewhere and your guess is as good as mine as to whether I'm contributing enough or investing correctly. My job takes up a lot of my time and I don't make as much as I think I should. Fortunately, we save enough for short-term family vacations to release some of the stress, but other than that, I really don't have much of a financial plan.It's amazing how the word ""finances"" immediately throws us head-on into our current circumstances. From this standpoint you may not see many options for what to do from a personal financial perspective. Guess what? That's completely natural.When it comes to planning for your future, finances are only a part of the process, albeit, an important one. If you step back and take into account everything that comes into play when planning for your future, you can view your finances as simply a tool in the toolbox that you can use to help you along the way. Centering the conversation on this one tool does not work. It's like heading out on the golf course with nothing but a 7 iron (I actually had a friend who played 18 holes with this one club... and it wasn't pretty).I've created a process for you to use for this big picture planning. It's called Dare to D-R-E-A-M: Discover... the life you love, Recognize... the obstacles in your way, Evaluate... your current financial circumstances, Architect... a roadmap for your future, and Mobilize... and get into action.From this standpoint, you can look beyond your current circumstance and envision a life that you truly want to live. By brainstorming different choices, your mind will naturally expand and you may start to think about what you really want, and not simply what your current circumstances will allow you to have. That's a big difference!Once you have established what you want, the next step is to identify the obstacles that are in your way. What are the physical, emotional, financial circumstances and beliefs that keep you where you are today? These are like the monster under the bed. Once a child takes a look and sees that the monster doesn't look so scary, she can go to sleep soundly. This is no different for you. It's often the fear of the unknown that stops you in your tracks. Shine a light on that unknown and suddenly it's not so bad.From here you can actually check your current financial circumstances, taking a look at cash flow (income and expenses), assets (home, car, investment accounts, etc.), liabilities (typically this is debt: credit cards, mortgage, car loan, etc.) credit score, benefits through work... and the list goes on.At this point you have identified where it is that you want to go (a life plan if you will) and pinpointed where you are today. Establishing these two points is of utmost importance, because it allows you to start the fourth step which is to architect the roadmap for your future. This is the easy part as it's simply a game of connect the dots, simply asking yourself the question, ""How do I get from point A to point B?""Finally, and most importantly, once your roadmap has been drawn up, it's time to take action! The best plan in the world is nothing more than a bunch of well-constructed thoughts unless you execute it. Taking small actions often will have you move forward and that's the key to achieving any goals.It's this type of planning that makes what I do worthwhile. Simply focusing on the financial circumstances of your life makes it hard to get out of your own way. Take a stab at working through the D-R-E-A-M process and let me know how it goes by commenting below. I think you'll see things for what they are, and from there, the power is in your hands. It's no longer your financial plan... it's your life plan.Sign up for the Views From Your Hammock e-newsletter to receive more thought provoking information.Video Powered by Bank of America:"

The addition of technology had complicated the process of meeting someone. I was overwhelmed by dating websites, communicating via email, searching (not stalking of course) on Facebook, and texting... a lot of texting. I learned that most modern-day romances live on text. After all, who has the time to talk?   My quest to find love in the age of technology brought me (kicking and screaming) to an online dating site. As I started using it, I learned that others online shared my commitment to impersonal communication. Here is how it works: a few messages are exchanged on the site, followed by some emails. Next, cell phone numbers are exchanged and then you start texting until a date is planned. Most post-date conversations are conducted via text. Rarely is there ever an actual phone call.   I was about to give up when someone totally changed the game for me. Not only did his profile speak directly to my heart, but within hours of first connecting we were talking on the phone. For those of you who may have forgotten what that means, it is the process of using a phone as it was originally intended... dialing a number and speaking live with another person. Sure, we exchanged a few messages first. But then, he asked for my number claiming he would call. I expected the texts would start. He quickly declared ""I do not text,"" and let me know his credo on communication: ""Just push the green button."" At first I found this to be truly peculiar and acknowledge your current confusion.  He would call in the morning before I started my day. I first thought ""couldn't he just text 'Good Morning?'"" There were midday check-ins to see how my day was going. Then, after he put his children to sleep, I got another phone call. It wasn't that I didn't appreciate the effort, since I did love the sound of his voice -- but it was alien behavior to me.  You see, I'm a social media consultant continually connecting with others personally and professionally in cyberspace. Messaging and emailing is what I do all day. I did know I needed to unplug more often. In fact, I would joke that I needed to find a partner who would kindly say to me ""Honey, it is time to close the screens."" The universe didn't just provide me with someone who would help me unplug, I was sent a living example of what I needed to do more often -- completely disconnect. In addition to not texting early on, my guy declared ""I'm not on Facebook, not sure what Twitter is, and I only have a LinkedIn profile for business."" The fact that someone like this exists remains utterly intriguing.  As the relationship has moved forward, I have really started to notice how everyone around me is so plugged-in. Take a good look around the next time you are out to dinner, and see how many other patrons are on their phones ignoring their dining companions. There is a pervasive feeling that you need to be connected to the outside world rather than connecting with the person sitting next to you. Trust me, technology is fun, but my guy is really onto something. Put away the phone and just talk!  As for our phone calls, not only have I adjusted to the oddity but I love them. A behavior I once thought was completely bizarre I now cherish. When his picture pops up on my phone as it rings, yeah, my heart flips. Sometimes we both only have minutes to chat, like when we are driving to work, dropping off a carpool, helping our children with their homework assignments or cooking dinner. But it's the idea of reaching out and making a personal connection that makes it well worth the effort. ""I'm thinking of you"" sounds much better than it looks on my phone.   Any romantic relationship should bring joy to your life and enrich it in many ways. My guy and I certainly have a strong foundation of matched craziness, energy and trust in one another. He's joined my inner circle, met my children, and gives great business advice. His presence has also shown me the importance of personally connecting, and I now find myself ""pushing the green button"" when I have a lot to share with a close friend or client. There is a great simplicity in just picking up the phone and talking."

I wasn't just comfortable with the products, I was confident in the way they mixed, the application, the process and, of course, the outcome -- consistent quality that I could count on.I suppose that my satisfaction was linked in part to my familiarity with the line, and my clients were never dissatisfied. I was reluctant to try something new. Then I did. I'm ecstatic. And this column is about change.Let me step back a few months. The decision I made to switch color lines closely followed another change -- I cut my hair short. Very short.I loved long hair, but the familiarity, in this case, became a rut. I was just feeling kind of frumpy with what had become an everyday look. I felt like I needed a big change. So, last May I went short, and I love it. It's great. It's fun. I feel younger, not just because of the edgy, contemporary style but because it is a change.I had another motivation for making a switch: my clients. Some of them had talked about changing their ""hair life"" -- a term coined by friend and fitness model Torrie Wilson -- ""hair life"" is a perfect description for the greater aura encompassed by our hair, and my clients wanted to change their hair life. Some of them, however, were afraid of just that - ""change,"" like I was. Cutting my hair was a way to point to the confidence they had inside. The results were stunning. Not only did everyone support my decision to go short, but several clients finally took the leap they'd been pondering and changed their hair, and several stylists in the salon where I do hair three times a week went short, too!Originally, I went very short and platinum blonde, with the sides and back shaved pretty close. It was very liberating for me to go with a dramatic cut. And having changed once, I realized that I could, and should, change again. I soon went with more natural colors and a softer edge, and I change the shape frequently now, often subtly.The bigger change, really, was switching hair color lines for my clients. Another friend and colleague, Robert Edick, has been talking about this product for a few years but it wasn't available in the United States until recently. He found it while training in Europe. Even knowing how great this product is, though, changing was oddly challenging. Now, though, I could not be happier. The improved quality of my work is distinct. The results have given me new confidence. Like so many stylists, I am devoted to my clients, and maybe that contributed to my reluctance. As the saying goes, ""if it's not broken, don't fix it."" My clients have been happy for years. And why would I take a risk with those smiles, that beautiful expression of warmth and satisfaction on their faces. I live for that. But we owe our clients more than consistency. We need to provide them with the latest and best developments in the art. That requires us to pursue continued education, to review and refine our skills, to look for the best that our industry has to offer.I know how difficult it can be to attend a class or research the latest products online when you have a business to manage and kids to carpool across all creation, but this is so important. You must find ways of upping your game and pushing the boundaries of what you know. The task may be tedious but you'll probably feel more confident and energized, the education will make you more valuable, and it's what your clients deserve. Be open to change!"

High School will go on, despite objections from parents in the community. Over the past few weeks, local parents have taken issue with the Detroit-area school’s planned spring production of “Carrie: The Musical,” saying that the show is vulgar and offensive. School administrators maintain that the play is perfectly appropriate.The work is based on Steven King’s novel Carrie, which has spawned several movies including Brian De Palma's acclaimed 1976 film of the same name. It follows a teenage girl who has telekinetic powers and is often bullied by peers and her religiously fanatic mother. The story ends with mass murder in a school gym. Some parents have called the play insensitive because of the violence it portrays. Others have taken issue with the way it depicts Carrie’s religious mother, saying it perpetuates negative stereotypes about fundamentalist Christians, according to Detroit outlet The Oakland Press.“You are welcome to think of our high school students as worldly and complex, but you are not allowed to think of them as adults. They are still children, even at that age,” local parent Tom Adams said at a recent school board meeting, according to The Oakland Press. “I am convinced that this material was not chosen on its merits, but rather by its inherent divisiveness, and on that measure alone should be disqualified for presentation.”Administrators at the school have countered that the show will force students to think about the harms of bullying.“It pushes the notion of anti-bullying through a fantastical lens,” Principal Joe Greene told the Detroit Free Press. “It’s a look at difficult topics and engages people into thinking about it."" District Superintendent Susan H. Zurvalec also defended the production, per a statement printed by Detroit outlet WXYZ:The directors of the play, Dean and Sue Cobb, have been producing plays and musicals at North Farmington High School for more than 30 years and more than 80 shows. While this musical is not for everyone and is rated PG-13, the Cobb’s longtime record and respect for students and families allows for the school district to place our trust in them. We know that they will present the production in a sensible and appropriate fashion. High school senior, Katherine Violet Harvath, who is in the show, told The Oakland Press that she agrees with the school's decision to perform Carrie.“The cast and crew have had our eyes opened to try and make a change in the world to stop the idea of bullying,” she said. “Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and none of them can be considered wrong. It is unfortunate that people cannot look past the violence and religious aspect of the show.""The school's production will take place in early May. "

Even if I don't agree with their statements or actions, I often find out new things about myself and what I want out of life (and don't want) as a result of these conversations. Of course, I have my own daily trip-ups, hang-ups and stumbles to learn from as well. Here, I share the list I wrote for myself detailing the lessons I have learned thus far. Perhaps you'll gain something from one or two, disagree with others or honor us all with your own lessons in the comment section below.If you are living authentically and without fear, you can't please everyone (or even most people) for longer than a couple of weeks. If you find yourself proving this wrong, take it as a sign you need to make a change.You aren't supposed to get through life without scuffing your knees, breaking your heart, or taking a wrong turn. Lessons and sorrows are the shading in the overall painting.In spite of what is perpetuated by romantic comedies, the truth is that you are complete all on your own, all of the time.People who cannot communicate effectively, clearly and respectfully tend to live very difficult lives.Taking pride in your work, reputation, value system and appearance is a great way to get to where you want to go much faster.Your value does not shrink or expand in relation to how much emotion, time or money someone else is willing to spend on you.Rage, entitlement, and arrogance may help you break down a wall, but compassion, good manners, and a calm demeanor are the keys to getting through the door and being welcomed on the the other side.Missing them doesn't mean they should be welcomed back.Love is a precious and valuable gift. It's almost as valuable as time with someone you love.That said, love is not enough.No one is going to swoop in and save you or grant you three wishes. If you want something, you'd better work for it.Life is lovely and exciting, but it isn't always fair.When it's over, you'll wish you put down that phone and paid closer attention and you won't care about those petty arguments.You're not supposed to be like everybody else. This is why you have your very own body, mind and soul.Most people get jealous, angry and worked up over stupid things.Every day we make a choice to go out and play or stare at a wall where the past is hanging.Sincere apologies mean something. Those friendships without them mean nothing.Life is hard enough without having to spend it with hard people.Aside from your actions and reactions, you can't control it, whatever it is. The smallest lie can cause the biggest heartache.Those who love you care when they hurt you, even when they didn't mean to. You're much smarter, stronger and more capable than you think -- and much less invincible.Every person on this earth is a human being and all human beings were created equal, so don't look up and don't look down.Your heart can be mistaken but your gut is always right, even when you don't want it to be.No one is living perfect life, they just have perfect moments like you and me. Everyone has problems.Don't bother with people for whom decency/kindness/honesty is something they have to ""work on.""Some obligations, disappointments and heartaches are just blessings with the wrong name.When you feel something is right, go with it.Dreams are important, but reality only changes when we do.Passion without compassion is a disaster.Opportunity does not come knocking, it waits for you to find it.You really don't have to put up with all of that crap, you know?You are not responsible for the things your parents did or did not say to you, do for you, or teach you. You are, however, responsible for everything you say, do and show others. Drunk or sober, angry or joyful, sincere or not.Sometimes you ""win"" by just deciding to stop talking, get up and go.Just because she is pretty or he is attractive doesn't mean you're not. Just because he or she has a great job or has has met someone doesn't mean you won't. Turn that jealousy into inspiration and watch your life blossom.It's not about being ""hot."" It's about being intelligent, honest, kind, self-respecting, decent and drop-dead smart. That's gorgeous.There's plenty of good men and women out there. If someone gives you anxiety, excuses, a reason not to believe him/her or anything that requires a prescription, they need to be out of your life.Having a relationship is not the goal. Having a healthy, happy and loving relationship (with yourself and then someone else) is.There's never a reason to be a mean girl. You're an intelligent, compassionate and professional woman. Carry yourself like one and surround yourself with women who think catty is best reserved for Lindsay Lohan movies.When it comes to your relationships, spend more time than money, give more compliments than criticisms, and for goodness sake, flash your manners.A negative imagination is a dangerous, destructive device. Just because they say it, or you think it, doesn't make it true.Men who have six packs and great biceps often sustain themselves on a diet consisting of chicken and eggs and will choose the gym over date night with you. Remember that.It's OK to be ambitious, but ruthless? Bye, bye network.Don't spend your time trying to date a baller. Spend it working to become a baller. He or she who dates someone for money should not be surprised when they treat them poorly. How do you treat that sweater you bought three years ago?It's OK to like sex. If you have it with someone who has not shown you respect, told you they love you, or wanted to date you before having it, it's not a good idea to expect the act alone to change the status quo.Keeping your nose clean and living with dignity upgrades everything from your relationships to your mental stability.Just because you ignore it doesn't make it go away, and just because you rationalize it doesn't make it right, and just because you want him doesn't make him right for you.Karma is really cause and effect. Change your actions, reactions and the way you put yourself out there and you'll change the way the world responds to you.Love means different things to different people. When you say ""I Love You,"" you are taking responsibility for your actions and suggesting you will care about another person and their feelings. If they love you like they love hot dogs and songs on their playlist, that's not going to do much for you long-term.Happiness may not always be as easy as making a choice to be happy, but we always have a choice as to how to filter situations we find ourselves in. Is it proof the universe hates us or is it just life?You have things about you that make you oh-my-goodness-look-at-them beautiful.Your life is happening, right now, in real time. The world is moving and days are passing. This can be seen as time passing us by or an ever-present opportunity to experience something new, make amends, step into a new direction, reach out and show gratitude. Just remember that everything you want is out there and everything you need to achieve it is inside of you."
