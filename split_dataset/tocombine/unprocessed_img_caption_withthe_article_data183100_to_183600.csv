After his casting of Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Tyra Banks and Christy Turlington in the 1990 video for ""Freedom '90,"" it seemed only natural that he'd turn to another big-leaguer in the future. This time around, he opted for just one iconic face: the doe-eyed Kate Moss.The British model breezes into his dreamy video for ""White Light"" in a patchwork fur coat (a very Kate choice), black nail polish and drop earrings. The song references George Michael's recent near-death experience of falling ill with a severe case of pneumonia, so there's a very hazy quality to the video.While her role isn't groundbreaking, Kate is looking quite pretty as her hair gets blown back throughout the song. The rocker's wife (Kate just celebrated her first wedding anniversary with The Kills' Jamie Hince) even nabbed a climactic role dramatically flipping a coin at the end of the video. So what do you think of Kate's performance? Check out the video and tell us what you think. See more instances of models and musicians colliding!Want more?

The 17 hospitals on the list, most of them household names, excel across a broad spectrum of patient care, scoring at or near the top this year in at least six of the 16 Best Hospitals medical specialties.Displacing Johns Hopkins, Mass General is No. 1 for the first time. It marks the end of a 21-year reign for Hopkins that started in 1991, the year after U.S. News began publishing Best Hospitals. Another first: Indiana University Health is new to the Honor Roll.More from U.S. News: Introducing the 2012-13 Hospital Rankings Photos: A Tour of the Best Hospitals Best Hospitals: The Complete RankingsThree of the Honor Roll hospitals are located in New York City, and two -- Brigham and Women's in addition to Mass General -- are in Boston. No other city has more than one hospital in this select group.To make the Honor Roll, a hospital had to earn at least one point in each of six specialties. A hospital earned two points if it ranked among the top 10 hospitals in America in any of the 12 specialties in which the U.S. News rankings are driven mostly by objective data, such as survival rates and patient safety. Being ranked in the next 10 in those specialties earned a hospital one point. In the other four specialties, where ranking is based on each hospital's reputation among doctors who practice that specialty, the top five hospitals in the country received two Honor Roll points and the next five got one point."
