You can just feel the weirdness, fo shizzle. Supporting a charity is cool (in this case it was Dance to Erase MS). Wearing silly outfits and making this face with your brother is not. Remember when ex-wife Jessica Simpson forced Nick to taste test her Dessert Treats lotion line? The fact that the product launch was nontoxic is seriously troubling. Gag. Holy moly. The stylist who chose this 2004 magazine cover ensemble needs to be fired. Before E! made her a household name, Kim Kardashian briefly dated Nick. He admitted the romance was probably for her fame-climbing benefit. Lachey experimented with his own album that debuted a decade ago. It was decent and everything, but the title ""SoulO"" is cringeworthy.  After going solo, Nick confused himself with Justin Timberlake. Yes your dick is in a box but where's the effort? You're not JT's R&B alter ego Raif. Nice try though.  "

Sisqo does oversized animal skin best. That cap is questionable, though ... it's giving off a serious lunch lady vibe.  7. Ill-fitting denim and a flag headband scream America. Or something? 8.

Insurance companies must recognize the risk of chronicity and the severe manifestations of Lyme disease in the lives of the patients they insure."" -- Dan CameronThe ""We are the 300,000"" campaign is a new grassroots campaign by the Lyme community to raise awareness for more effective treatments for all people suffering from Lyme disease. According to the CDC, there are 300,000 individuals who are affected annually by Lyme disease. How to treat patients who are misdiagnosed or diagnosed late has created decades of debate between doctors, patients and scientists trying to determine why many patients remain seriously ill long after the standard antibiotic treatment for this disease. While more research continues to indicate that Lyme bacteria remains ""persistent"" after treatment and more doctors around the world claim they are seeing co-infections in as many as 90% of their patients, the IDSA's guidelines for treatment of patients have not been revised. This can lead to insurance claim issues for patient treatments. For this reason, Lyme disease is often called a rich person's disease, since those without money are unable to afford proper treatment.Karen Miller, of Lyme Aid Santa Rosa, started a support group in 2009 and explains, ""I have talked to hundreds of patients and their families. Insurance is a problem for every single one of them. This includes private insurance, public insurance, VA and Indian Health agencies."" Are insurance companies and physicians across the country aware of the new studies in progress and the complex issues related to diagnosing and returning Lyme patients to good health? Are they aware of existing treatments that appear to be helping some patients? Today in Part 14 of ""Ticks,"" I have invited two leading Lyme disease doctors to comment on some of these major issues. Fresh off his recent appearance on the Katie Couric show, it's my pleasure to welcome clinician and author Dr. Richard Horowitz (Why Can't I Get Better? Solving the Mystery of Lyme and Chronic Disease, St. Martin's Press). Additionally, I asked Dr. Daniel Cameron to weigh in. Dan just began a reprise of his presidency of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS). He has testified as an expert on Lyme disease for legislation in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, and been featured as a Lyme expert on national media, including NBC's Today Show and ABC's Good Morning America. ""The term ""chronic Lyme disease"" needs to be redefined as Lyme-MSIDS to more accurately reflect the multiple underlying etiologies responsible for persistent symptoms.""  -- Richard HorowitzRichard, what does the term ""chronic Lyme disease"" mean to you?Patients with chronic symptoms after classical treatment for Lyme disease have multifactorial causes for their illness. I call this syndrome Lyme-MSIDS. MSIDS stands for Multiple Systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome, and represents sixteen potential overlapping medical problems contributing to persistent symptoms in the Lyme patient. The first point on the MSIDS map is infections. Ticks are now containing multiple bacterial, viral and parasitic infections that can be transmitted simultaneously with Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease. Patients infected with Lyme disease and associated co-infections are much sicker and resistant to standard therapies. Patients with Lyme-MSIDS also have evidence of associated immune dysfunction, inflammation, environmental toxins and heavy metal burdens, detoxification problems, nutritional deficiencies, hormonal abnormalities, sleep disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, food allergies and sensitivities, deconditioning and imbalances in their autonomic nervous system (the part of the body that controls the heart rate, blood pressure and digestive system). All of these factors can keep the patient chronically ill.There is a commonly held belief in medicine, called Pasteur's postulate, that there is ""one cause for one illness."" This does not apply to patients with chronic Lyme symptoms. The term ""chronic Lyme disease"" needs to be redefined as Lyme-MSIDS to more accurately reflect the multiple underlying etiologies responsible for persistent symptoms. ""Patients with Lyme-MSIDS also have evidence of associated immune dysfunction, inflammation, environmental toxins and heavy metal burdens, detoxification problems, nutritional deficiencies, hormonal abnormalities, sleep disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, food allergies and sensitivities, deconditioning and imbalances in their autonomic nervous system."" -- Richard HorowitzDan, many Lyme patients I have interviewed have problems with insurance claims. Can you please comment?The physicians with the most experience in treating Lyme disease do not participate with the leading health plans, which makes it difficult for patients. The doctors with the most experience cannot manage the complexity of care needed to properly treat Lyme disease patients. The cost of the first visit can be expensive and is not covered within the plan. Patients with out of network benefits typically apply the cost to their deductible. The local labs are covered by health care plans but if a specialty lab is required it can cost $1,000 and this may not be covered. The prescriptions for common drugs, for example, Doxycycline, Amoxicillin, Ceftin, and Biaxin often are covered by a prescription plan. The price without insurance coverage can range from $40 to several hundred dollars per month. The cost for the co-infection drugs to treat Babesia, for example, can range from $40 for Flagyl to nearly $2,000 for Mepron per month, and this may not be covered. Some insurance companies deny coverage for intravenous antibiotics, citing the IDSA guidelines. The cost of IV, if not covered by an insurance company, can be expensive and places a huge burden on the individual and their family.Richard, why is it so difficult for some patients to get better?Tick-borne co-infections play a large role in keeping patients ill, and the tests for Lyme disease and co-infections are unreliable. These infections are routinely missed using standard blood tests, because the tests are not sensitive enough to pick up the presence of these organisms that can hide from the immune system. Patients also remain chronically ill because many of these tick-borne infections persist despite ""seemingly adequate"" antimicrobial therapies, leading to immune dysfunction and inflammation. These infections cause the release of inflammatory molecules called cytokines, which are responsible for many of the symptoms we see with Lyme disease, including fatigue, joint and muscle pain, memory and concentration problems, and mood disorders. Unless we simultaneously treat the three ""I's"": infection, immune dysfunction and inflammation, patients will not get better.Finally, most physicians are unaware of the concept of MSIDS, and that there are multifactorial causes for the patient's illness. It is as if a patient came to the doctor with sixteen nails in their foot complaining of foot pain. Unless you pull out all of the nails, the patient is not going to feel better. ""Unless we simultaneously treat the three ""I's"": infection, immune dysfunction and inflammation, patients will not get better."" -- Richard HorowitzRichard, Lyme disease has been known to mimic so many disease processes including CFS, Fibromyalgia, Autoimmune conditions, Psychiatric conditions including Dementia, etc. What advice can you share with doctors trying to diagnose a disease like Lyme? What should doctors be looking for?Lyme disease is a multi-systemic illness, so taking a proper history is essential in making the clinical diagnosis. For example, patients with Lyme disease often have a cluster of classic presenting symptoms, which include fatigue, joint and muscle pain, neuropathic pain (tingling, numbness and burning), sleep disorders, as well as memory and concentration problems. Although these same symptoms can overlap other diseases, there are certain classic symptoms that point towards Lyme. Lyme disease symptoms tend to come and go with good and bad days. The joint and muscle pain as well as the neuropathic pain tend to migrate around the body. These symptoms may improve with antibiotic therapy, or worsen with antibiotics (a Jarish-Herxheimer reaction), and women often report an increase in symptoms right before, during, or after their menstrual cycle.If physicians were to routinely give out a screening questionnaire of Lyme symptoms and review it during the patients visit, this would alert them to the presence of a multi-systemic illness. They should then send off a tick borne panel with a Lyme Western Blot. If Borrelia specific proteins such as the 23, 31, 34, 39 and/or 83-93kda bands return positive and other diseases have been ruled out, then Lyme disease is likely. ""The physicians with the most experience in treating Lyme disease do not participate with the leading health plans which makes it difficult for patients. The doctors with the most experience cannot manage the complexity of care needed to properly treat Lyme disease patients."" -- Dan CameronRichard, you have treated over 12,000 Lyme patients and made extraordinary progress. Can you share with us briefly some of your key strategies when treating a patient with this disease?Patients with Lyme disease can be extremely complex, so it is important to have them fill out a Lyme questionnaire at each visit to track their symptoms and progress. Do they have day sweats, night sweats and chills? If Babesiosis and associated parasitic infections are not properly diagnosed and treated, patients will not get better. Similarly, co-infections like Bartonella and Mycoplasma can cause resistant symptoms. Combining and rotating antibiotics to address the different forms of Lyme disease, as well as simultaneously treating associated co-infections will often have a positive clinical effect. It is also essential to review the Lyme-MSIDS map and see if there are any associated medical conditions interfering with the patient's clinical progress. This requires that all appropriate diagnostic tests be performed. Prioritizing and addressing the sixteen points on the MSIDS map will ensure that those suffering from Lyme disease have the best chance of recovering their health.Dan, what is currently being done and what more needs to be done to improve awareness for clinicians and treatment for patients?ILADS continues to encourage further dialogue between doctors with different views on Lyme disease. We also offer training programs through our members for physicians to help them understand the complexities of diagnosing and treating Lyme disease.  However, we need to begin to do more clinical trials to better understand how we treat people who remain seriously ill after contracting Lyme disease. Additionally, we need to continue to understand the range of infections that may be passed along in a tick bite such as Babesia, Anaplasmosis and Ehrlichiosis. Insurance companies must recognize the risk of chronicity and the severe manifestations of Lyme disease in the lives of the patients they insure.

(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da68b2100003000c59bd4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rap and health consciousness may not seem like a natural duo, but for Khnum Ibomu, or Stic -- best known as half of the rap group Dead Prez -- promoting a healthy lifestyle is a natural extension of the themes of political activism, social justice and personal motivation that run through his music. In a recent HuffPost blog, 7 Ways to Eat Good on a Hood Budget, he laid out tips for eating healthy without breaking the bank. I talked to Stic about how he became interested in the holistic lifestyle -- and why ""healthy is the new gangsta.""Seamus: In your piece, you say you don't have to break the bank to eat healthy. But what about the argument that you can feed a family dinner at a fast food place for twenty dollars?Stic: Well, you know, I understand that. Coming from the hood, coming from low-income and no-income communities, I understand that that seems like the logical thing to do. Yeah, you can feed a family of four for twenty bucks on fast food for one night, but you can take that same twenty dollars and get vegetables and fruits and make soups and salads -- and different snacks, raisins and nuts -- for the week, or at least a few days. And it's healthy food. Most people know you as a musician and an activist, but there are probably people who don't know about the health, fitness and food side. How'd you become interested in this stuff?I came down with a condition called gout, in my leg. Basically, I was living the young rapper's life: smoking weed, drinking, eating whatever was at the fast food restaurant. And one day I woke up with gout. In a nutshell, my wife helped me heal by introducing me to a vegan lifestyle and from there I wanted to get use of my leg back -- so I took up kung fu. I always say having gout in my early 20s was a blessing in disguise... but I don't want it again [laughs].We know from stats that poorer areas have worse access to healthy food -- and more access to convenience stores and fast food.The thing about it is that in those communities -- what a lot of people have started to call food deserts -- you tend to get what's convenient. You get what you have a taste for, from the chemical addiction in these things. That's a whole other level of how these fast food products wreak havoc on people -- in terms of the obesity epidemic and heart disease and all these things.You make an interesting point in your piece, where you say, We have to spend less money on alcohol, video games, TV, cigarettes. To what extent do lifestyle changes have to do with choices -- versus structural changes, like no access to healthy food?I'm an advocate of bottom-up and top-down. So I think that we have personal levels of responsibility over what we can do to educate ourselves to resist the culture of disease and addiction. But then we have social responsibility. As an artist, we have a unique place in that because we help articulate and create the inspiration, the interest, the intrigue, into some of these things happening. Throughout your music, you've dropped in themes of health. Maybe what people know best is the 2000 song ""Be Healthy."" That didn't feel mainstream then. How much has that awareness changed?It's changed dramatically, man. The Workout is the first ever hip-hop album to be authentically hip-hop, artistically, but to have the theme of every track promoting health and wellness. People like KRS-One before us has classics like the song ""Beef"" about the beef industry. And he was an educator and he inspired groups like us to come about. Is our society doing a good job of getting the word out about health? I feel like there's plenty of information out there -- we live in the information age. You have to ask yourself, ""What's the missing ingredient?"" I think there's an element of the internal motivation of the person that has to be addressed -- through the arts and through creative marketing and media -- to get people excited again. I still want to see a sitcom about a vegan family.That'd be radical.[Laughs] Yeah, but it's coming.You've always been part activist and part artist. Do you think that all artists should be activists by definition?I think all artists are activists. It's just a question of, ""What are we activating?"" Every song, every movie, everything that we create, reinforces an idea. It reinforces a world view. To an extent you've placed yourself outside, or against, the big corporate labels. I can understand why you say that. I try to position myself as to what I'm for, not what I'm against. I love hip hop. Hip hop is my lifestyle, it's my culture. But what I try to do is revolutionize it. Keep the aggression, keep the confidence, keep the innovation, the creativity, the slang, the expression, but add content that is positive. Are you working on new music?Yeah, I'm working on the follow-up to my album The Workout -- The Workout: Vol. 2. And I'm producing other things in the works.I just read an article by David Byrne [of the Talking Heads]. He was talking about Spotify and the changing culture around online music. Right on, yeah, I like David Byrne's book, How Music Works. That's a good read. I definitely have been more economically sustainable and successful by moving my career beyond the plantation of the big five record companies that we was tossed around in. In the song ""Be Healthy,"" I said ""my goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy."" I joke and say, ""But my goal in business is."" So for me, what I advocate to artists, what I advocated in my book The Art of MCing, is be your own boss. Be your own business. So that you don't have to go to a company that pretty much is designed to tell you what is standard -- which basically means you're sharecropping. Can the rules to being a successful MC be applied in the kitchen? I'm probably a much better MC than I am a chef... but I get down. I think an MC is open-minded and studies a lot -- so that you have something to say and have perspective that can be interesting or shed some light. And I think a chef has an open palate, and is interested in how all the elements of cooking create this art that we taste. And you have to have tough skin -- because everything you create musically ain't gonna hit and everything you make in the kitchen is not gonna be a gourmet masterpiece.You mentioned that your wife introduced you to cooking--Her philosophy on food has become mine. She's a creative artist. She's an inspiration. She's an educator of nutrition and she's open-minded, so she introduced me to cuisines I would never try. Like what?Broccoli. Brussels sprouts. Sushi rolls. All the greens -- we eat greens for breakfast and that's not a normal thing in the standard American diet but for our household that's the norm.If you had to have one spice, what would you go with?Can I have a tie? It would be smoked paprika and garam masala.It's hard not to be inspired by your message. But based on the epidemic health problems our country has, do you ever feel doomed about it?Absolutely I don't feel frustrated or demoralized or intimidated. I've seen so many positive results, it's impossible to not know we can whip this thing. My mom beat diabetes on a plant-based diet. These things are real. We always say in the hip hop community, ""Real recognize real."" And when we see that sipping syrup and poppin' Molly results in poor health and a loss of opportunity -- and we see somebody else drinking green juices and running and enjoying life to the fullest -- real gonna recognize real.One of Dead Prez's best known albums is Revolutionary But Gangsta. How is that concept relevant to the holistic lifestyle?I feel that advocating health is a revolutionary act. It's a form of activism. In fact, we need to bring being active back to activism -- and moving back to the movement. You know, literally. I'm much more centered and grounded spiritually than when I was carrying pistols in the streets. We don't forget where we come from but we also don't forget where we're going.""Healthy is the new gangsta"" is the tag line for RGB Fit Club, a health movement you've created. What do you mean by that?Gangsta as a term is really just a way to describe something that is really fresh or strong or magnetic -- it's like another word for saying ""that's dope"" or ""that's fly."" For me, I wanted to put it in the context of health. What's more gangsta than health? What's more gangsta than feeling good?"

Civil war in Syria and the movement of refugees in the region have hampered immunisation in recent years.""The polio outbreak in Syria is not just a tragedy for children, it is an urgent alarm - and a crucial opportunity to reach all under-immunised children wherever they are,"" Peter Crowley, UNICEF's Chief of Polio, said in a statement.He said the recent outbreak in Syria, confirmed by the WHO last week, should ""serve as a stark reminder to countries and communities that polio anywhere is a threat to children everywhere.""WHO spokeswoman Sona Bari said it would take six months of repeated campaigns to reach 22 million children.""It is going to need quite an intense period of activity to raise the immunity in a region that has really been ravaged both by conflict in some parts, but also by large population movements,"" she told a briefing in Geneva.The first polio outbreak in Syria since 1999, it has so far paralysed 10 children and poses a risk of paralysis to hundreds of thousands of children across the region, the WHO said.Emergency immunisation campaigns in and around Syria to prevent transmission of polio and other preventable diseases have vaccinated more than 650,000 children in Syria, including 116,000 in the northeast Deir al-Zor province where the polio outbreak was confirmed. There is high demand among parents. RUSH""There's a rush to vaccinate,"" Bari quoted a WHO official present in Deir al-Zor during vaccinations there as saying.The WHO was ""optimistic"" about containing the outbreak, Bari said. ""That said, we're certainly going to see more cases.""Syria's immunisation rates have plummeted from more than 90 percent before the conflict to currently around 68 percent.Preliminary evidence has indicated the virus is of Pakistani origin, but results of genetic sequencing are awaited. Polio is still endemic in Pakistan, along with Nigeria and Afghanistan.""We're never going to know exactly how it arrived in Syria,"" Bari said.""We also know that adults tend to have much higher level of immunity already developed, so it is unlikely that adults brought this. It is more likely some other route.""Children in unsanitary conditions are particularly vulnerable to infection with the polio virus, which spreads through faecal-oral transmission and contaminated food and water.It attacks the nerves and can kill or paralyse, often spreading widely and unnoticed before it starts crippling children. For every case of polio, 200 children can be infected. There is no cure, but it can be prevented though vaccination.The WHO said the vaccinations were vital in a region that had not seen polio for nearly a decade, but which in the last 12 months has detected the polio virus in sewage samples from Egypt, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
