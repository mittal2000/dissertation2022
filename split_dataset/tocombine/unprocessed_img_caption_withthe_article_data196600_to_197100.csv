This New York deli treat might have come in handy for nine year old Oskar Schell; (explorer, jeweler, inventor, tambourine player and vegan pacifist). He's mourning his Dad who passed when the towers fell. To keep his memory alive he's on a quest across five boroughs to discover the truth about a key that belonged to someone named Black. Oskar's about to discover that, unlike these cookies, life isn't always black and white. If you're craving some dichotomy in your day you could make like 'The Renter' and tattoo 'yes' and 'no' on your palms. Then again, you could just have it inscribed on a cookie (don't worry Oskar- these ones are vegan friendly).Vegan Black and White Cookies: Makes 18 cookiesEquipment: two baking trays, baking paper, microplane, medium bowl, paintbrush, heat proof bowl, spatula and small spoon.Shopping/foragingCookies ½ cup soy milk 1 tsp lemon juice ¼ cup canola oil ½ cup caster sugar ½ tsp vanilla extract 1 ¼ cups self raising flour 1 tbsp cornflour 1 tsp lemon zest Pinch of saltIcing 1 cup icing/confectioners sugar 3 tbsp cocoa powder 2 tsp vegetable/canola/sunflower oil 1 tbsp of hot waterHere's how we roll1. Preheat oven to 350 F/ 180 C degrees. Line two baking sheets with baking paper.2. Take a medium bowl and mix together the lemon juice and milk and let them get to know each other in the bowl for two minutes. Add the zest, sugar and oil and whisk well.3. In another bowl sift together the self raising flour, salt and cornflour. Create a well in the center and pour in the oil and milk mix.4. Stir well until all of the lumps have been worked out.5. Using a tablespoon to portion out the cookies. If you want to get really precise about it, weigh the batter so each cookie is 27 grams. Transfer to the baking tray and form circles. Depress the centers slightly with your thumb so the cookies don't rise too much. Leave two inches between the cookies for them to spread (three rows of three on each tray works well). Bake for 17 minutes until the edges turn light brown.6. Remove the cookies and let them cool for two minutes on the trays.7. Turn them upside down to cool.8. To make the white icing put the icing sugar/confectioners sugar in a heat proof bowl. Add a tablespoon of hot water and whisk until you have a glossy paste.9. Use a small clean paintbrush to spread an even layer of white icing over half of the cookie.10. Add three tablespoons of cocoa powder to the remaining icing to make it dark. Add two teaspoons of vegetable oil to give it a sheen. Paint the other half of the cookies and then leave them to dry.11. If you fancy, use a toothpick to write 'Yes' and 'No' on the white side of the cookies with the black icing.Best eaten on the day of making but you can make them ahead and store in an airtight container in a single layer.For illustrated step-by-step instructions, go here "

This Boursin soufflé does not stand in for Hugo because a baguette with Boursin cheese is the classic picnic to take on a train.It does not stand in for Hugo because of the resemblance between a baguette speared soufflé and the film's celebration of George Melies' Man in the Moon with a rocket in his eye.Nor because the rise of a proper soufflé is an action best captured by 3D technology. It's more about the alchemy that happens when you combine the right things; here it's the levity of egg whites and a little bit of cheese. It's about the importance of timing, in a train station, a dish and a life. It's about not giving up hope if something flops. And it's about knowing how much gooey cheesiness you can get your audience to swallow. Scorsese got it right. This soufflé does too.Twice baked Boursin soufflés: Serves 4 -- These can be pre-baked earlier and left to cool before being baked a second time just before serving.Equipment: Four one cup ramekins, two saucepans, one electric whisk, one bowl, a roasting dish large enough to hold the ramekins, filled half full of hot water, four oven proof bowls and a microplane.Shopping/foraging1 tbsp butter to grease ramekins 2 tbsp breadcrumbs 225 ml milk 40 grams unsalted butter 40 grams plain flour 125 grams/ 4 and a half ounces Boursin/ soft goat cheese 50 grams/ 1.7 ounces of Gruyere or parmesan cheese 3 eggs separated 1 tablespoon thyme leaves 125 ml double cream Baguette slices, to serve.Here's how we roll1.

Beat in the egg yolks, thyme and 125g Boursin/(or soft goat cheese).6. Whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff. Fold in a tablespoon of the egg whites into the cheese mix to lighten it, and then carefully fold the rest of the egg whites.7. Divide the mix gently between the ramekins and place in a baking tray filled half way up with hot water.8. Bake for 20 minutes until they've colored at the top and risen.9. Leave to cool (and sink) and then carefully loosen with a sharp knife. Turn out the soufflés and transfer to individual heat proof dishes.10. When you're ready to serve preheat the oven to 200C/ 390 F, pour some cream over each soufflé and sprinkle on the Gruyère/parmesan. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until well-risen and golden.

Instead, when the clock strikes midnight Gil gets whisked away to the Paris of writer's and artist's fantasies.This Coq au Vin is exactly the kind of dish that could get me out of bed at midnight. The taste takes you straight to Paris. The flavors are soothing enough to heal if you can't scrounge up enough witty banter to play with Hemingway. The texture is as gentle as this plot. And frankly, it's a better use for a bottle of burgundy than bleating about its merits on a balcony with Michael Sheen.Coq au Vin: Serves: 6 - 8Equipment: one dutch oven, one fry pan.Shopping/foraging750ml Red Burgundy  25 g butter 1 tbsp olive oil 4 chicken marylands (thighs and legs attached) 3 chicken legs 3 chicken thighs 4 cloves garlic, chopped 12 shallots/ small onions, peeled and left whole 3 sprigs of fresh thyme 2 bay leaves 250g button mushrooms, cleaned and halved 125 g lardons 3 tbsp chopped fresh flat leaf parsley Salt and freshly ground black pepperThe way1. Heat the butter and oil in a dutch oven. Add the chicken in batches and brown for 8-10 minutes until brown.2. Add the garlic, shallots, herbs, wine and stock. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer gently for 45 minutes to 1 hour.3. Remove the chicken pieces and check the sauce. You may have to skim off some of the fat (you can do this by letting it cool and scooping it from the top or by dabbing at the top of the sauce with paper towel). Depending on how tannic the wine was you may want to add a tablespoon of sugar. Then turn up the heat and simmer the sauce for 10 minutes to reduce the liquid. 4. In a separate fry pan, fry the mushrooms and the lardons in a tablespoon of olive oil until brown. Add the chicken pieces, mushrooms and lardons back to the the sauce and top with chopped parsley.5. Serve over a puree of white beans, mashed potato or on its own with baguette pieces to dip in the sauce. For illustrated step by step instructions go here"

That began our potty training odyssey, inspired by my research into Chinese parenting culture and other ""odd"" family practices. My girl would go on to pee on the floor countless times, and sit with her bare bottom on precious items. But she would be trained within two (if wet) weeks.
