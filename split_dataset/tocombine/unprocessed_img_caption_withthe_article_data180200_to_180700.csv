0,WELLNESS,When Mentoring Never Ends,"Dr. Stephen Schoonmaker, Contributor

There are millions of other lives all around you. Each a person feeling happiness and sadness, each a person you may have the opportunity to meet, to know, to share a burden with, to like and/or to love.",2012-08-17,"This photo taken on March 26, 2011 shows a Chinese woman placing flowers at the grave of a loved one at the Babaoshan cemetery in Beijing to mark the annual Qing Ming (Ching Ming) Festival, or grave-sweeping day. Visiting the graves of ancestors during Qing Ming, this year marked on April 5, is an age-old Chinese tradition dating back 2000 years to the Han dynasty. CHINA OUT AFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c1f7e24000050005314d2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Being an educator sometimes places you in the right place at the right time. Ten years ago I got to know several students at the college where I was working and had the privilege of mentoring them as they earned their degrees. Though none of us are still at the college, or living in the same place, we have kept in contact with one another.Last week I received an email that greatly impacted me. Though it has been more than seven years since we have seen one another, this student returned seeking answers where none could possibly satisfy. At the urging of friends and colleagues I am sharing the email, as well as my response, in the hopes that it may offer perspective if your life seems overwhelming -- and bring some comfort in these difficult and challenging times.Hi Dr. S.,Death is a separation that seems so final to us as we struggle in life to adjust to the loss. While some grief is tempered by a long and well-lived life, so many of the deaths confronting you right now appear senseless -- lives taken too soon and abruptly. It is at these times we can feel overwhelmed by the darkness, finality, and tragedy of death. It is at these low ebbs of life that we confront the separateness of each living creature; we are alone, suffocating from the oppressive gloom of close friends and relatives torn too soon from your life.So far not too optimistic, I know, but an acknowledgment of the extraordinary condition you find yourself. Still, even in this complete sense of loss and darkness -- this is when we can truly find our way to a new appreciation for the preciousness of each day. Days tend to pass by in fleeting moments that make it far too easy to take them for granted. When we lose someone -- especially when we lose eight someones -- it is an opportunity to cherish the hours, minutes, and seconds we have each day as we carry on with our own life's journey without their companionship.I truly believe in the eternity of the soul. Therefore, I believe your family and friends still exist; they just do so in a manner I do not yet fully comprehend nor can I fully appreciate. I can, however, celebrate their souls' enduring nature. I can dedicate a portion of my remaining life in honor of the joy knowing them brought me; I can savor the pleasures of life all the more because I do so not just for me but also for the family and friends who came before me, shared some of life with me, and now have moved ahead of me to prepare and await for my arrival once I cease to exist in this mortal phase. My family and friends who have died are on their own adventure on the eternal plane while I am on my adventure on this earthly plane. I take up the mantle of responsibility to ""suck the marrow"" from this life not just for me but in memory and honor of those I have loved who have passed through this earth before me.You are facing the harsh reality that life does end -- we are not immortal here. But you have also been given the opportunity to treasure the moments of life that present themselves to you each and every day for the rest of your life. Your departed family and friends would want you to live life to your fullest potential -- not just for you but in memory of them. The weight of their memory isn't a heavy burden... it is a gift to you, representative of their love for you. I hope the sun is out tomorrow. That you get out in it and feel a gentle breeze upon your cheek. That you hear a bird's song, and hear the laughter inside a babbling brook. That a cloud may pass by in a familiar shape, causing you to smile. May all these things happen -- and when each one does it reminds you of the love each fallen friend shared with you, offered to you, and wishes for you every day. For now their memory may bring tears. That is OK and normal. The tears wash away the pain they endured in life and slowly remove the stain of sorrow you feel for them and for your loss of them. Soon the tears will slow and happier memories can be preserved to carry with you as your life's journey continues.Please remember you are not alone. There are millions of other lives all around you. Each a person feeling happiness and sadness, each a person you may have the opportunity to meet, to know, to share a burden with, to like and/or to love. Keep facing forward and stepping toward tomorrow. You never know what joy may be waiting for you around the very next corner. Go out tomorrow and see what you can discover of the wonders of this world. The possibilities are limitless -- all you have to do is take that next step and open your arms and heart to what may come your way.My thoughts and prayers are with you. Take care, Dr. S.For more by Dr. Stephen Schoonmaker, click here. For more on death and dying, click here. "
1,TRAVEL,Petting Lion Cubs in Port Elizabeth,"Sadie Dingfelder, Contributor
Humor, travel, science and arts writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/petting-lion-cubs_us_5b9c2017e4b03a1dcc7c7c49,"The lion cubs were so cute, I didn't even notice that they were also crusted with bits of gore.",2012-08-17,"Newly-named White African lion female cubs Makaili, left, and Lemon rest in the heat at the Toronto Zoo after their names were announced in Toronto on Thursday, Aug. 2, 2012. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Nathan Denette)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c20173c0000660009a4d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I recently went to South Africa, where I pet a lion cub. I'll tell that story, but first I have to tell you about my cat, Fuzz.When I adopted Fuzz, my parents refused to accept our relationship. ""She's just going through a phase,"" they said. ""She would have a dog, but she lives in a studio apartment,"" they told their friends. Now, six months later, they're acting like the newest members of the local PFLAG chapter -- sending me links to funny cat videos, buying cat-themed coasters, inviting my cat to join the family at Thanksgiving, etc.That was a big step for them, but owning cats isn't really that different than owning dogs. Cats just require a little more imagination. Dogs, you see, make it easy to believe that they really love you. They run to the door when you get home, wagging their tails and slobbering in a joyous manner. Now, you and I both know that your dog is not thinking, ""I love you so much, great and wonderful master!"" His thoughts are probably more along the lines of, ""Oh thank goodness, the hairless monkey with the food is back."" But we choose to believe they love us, if only to justify the vet bills.And dogs make it easy to believe. Cats, on the other hand, make you do the heavy lifting. It doesn't help that, while dogs automatically smile just by opening their mouths, cats always wear an expression of wide-eyed incredulousness. ""You're wearing that to work?"" my cat seems to ask with a quizzical tilt of his head. ""You could at least coordinate the food stains on your shirt with the food stains on your skirt,"" he adds.Though Fuzz has a bit of an attitude, I do believe he loves me. For instance, sometimes he sleeps on my feet. Never mind that, when he wakes up, he tends to attack my toes -- digging his claws into my skin as if to drive home the point that, if I were just a little bit smaller, I'd be kibble. Now, it's one thing to be delusional about the inner lives of housecats, but how about lions? Actually, it's surprisingly easy to believe that lions are all love and cuddles as well. While on safari in South Africa, my boyfriend and I came upon a pile of lion cubs. They rolled on their backs in the grass, taking clumsy swipes at each other, and being generally adorable. They really did look -- and act -- a whole lot like big kittens. The lion cubs were so cute, I didn't even notice that they were also crusted with bits of gore. ""Look, a jackal,"" said our guide, pointing out a lifeless heap of fur and entrails in the grass. Apparently, the cubs had batted around the poor wild dog all night. They didn't even have the decency to eat him afterward.Suddenly it became clear that, cute as they are, these 50-lb lion cubs could put a serious kibosh on our vacation.That, however, didn't stop us from visiting Seaview Lion Park, where you can pet a lion cub for the bargain price of about $9. Cheetahs, servals and tiger cubs were also available for petting, though the tiger cub was a bit pricier - at $18 for a five-minute turn.We were beginning to feel uneasy about the whole setup - the enclosures looked a bit small and dingy -- but we paid up anyway and entered a cage containing four sleepy lion cubs and an equal number of college-age ""volunteers"" who supervised our petting and provided dubious, lion-related information. ""He's not trying to hurt you,"" said one woman, when a cub took a swipe at Steve. ""He just doesn't know how strong he is."" I'm no lion expert, but I suspect that the cub wouldn't be all that chocked up if he disemboweled my boyfriend. Who knows, Steve might taste better than the jackal. I kept my trap shut, though, because I wanted a picture with a lion. Unfortunately, the only awake cub was busy chewing a hole through the pants of a volunteer. ""This is weird,"" Steve said. ""Let's get out of here.""Indeed, the whole thing felt seedy and sort of sad, like a strip club. I think our sense of unease came from the fact that just as nubile co-eds don't belong in the laps of sweaty septuagenarians, lion cubs don't belong in a petting zoo. And then there's the question of what happens to them when they get too big to pet. Some people suspect that they're sold to private game parks, where trophy hunters pay tens of thousands of dollars to shoot them. In any case, I feel sorry for having contributed $12 to this sad endeavor. However, you have to admit that whoever thought of it is pretty smart. The place is staffed by college kids who pay upwards of $2,000 for two-week ""internships,"" and the lions, well, they more than pay for themselves whether they are cute and cuddly, or fanged and fearsome. At another, more reputable park, I spotted a cat fast asleep in a porch chair. ""Ooooh, is that a serval?"" I asked. ""No, that's my housecat,"" said one of the owners, who thankfully didn't add, ""you imbecile."" Now, here's a cat I can cuddle without guilt, I thought. So I scooped up the kitty and made Steve take pictures. The cat probably hated it, but he was too lazy to protest. ""What a nice kitty,"" I said. ""Fuzz is going to be so jealous when I get home and he sees all these pictures of me with other cats."" I'm home now, and I must say, Fuzz is acting a little aloof. ""It was just a fling,"" I told him. ""It didn't mean anything."" In any case, I certainly won't be doing it again."

Paul Ryan, and his family, and Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and his family, partially visible at center back, wave to the crowd Saturday, Aug. 11, 2012, in Norfolk, Va. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c24c11f00005000211bac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What do new GOP VP candidate Paul Ryan and former GOP VP candidate Sarah Palin have in common?They're both the parents of young, school-aged children. Ryan's children -- ages 7, 8 and 9 -- are in that childhood sweet spot. They're just old enough not to need attention every moment of the day, but there's plenty of carpooling, after-school activities and homework to be done that means parents don't get to sit down until after the kids are asleep -- if they're lucky.Parenting in the 21st century is a full on, tag team sport. Except that for some reason, we still live in an age where mothers are expected to be the ones who carry the load, while dads (I know there are exceptions) chip in less frequently.The not-so-funny thing is this: The media outcry over ""who's going to take care of the kids"" was deafening when Palin accepted John McCain's invitation to join him on the 2008 Republican ticket. I have yet to hear anyone ask Congressman Ryan how he can possibly hold up his fatherly duties to his three elementary-school-aged children while doing his job as a Wisconsin representative AND campaigning across America as the person Mitt Romney hopes can save his presidential campaign.Of course, I know some people will say, ""Well, he has a stay-at-home wife and Palin's husband worked outside the home for a living."" Except that's not really the issue. I explored this ongoing double-standard in the chapter of my book, Mothers of Intention, entitled ""Who's Taking Care of the Kids?""As I remarked in that chapter: ""We're a country with some serious mother issues."" We still are. Those issues haven't gone away and, sadly, they probably won't in my lifetime. It's not just a conundrum about how modern motherhood plays out in the political realm -- there are plenty of other media portraits of motherhood responsible for the ongoing belief that if you're a woman with small children, you're the one who must shoulder all the responsibility for your kids' upbringing, regardless of whether you also have what George Clooney's character in the movie Intolerable Cruelty called a ""square"" job.Regardless of who is bringing home a paycheck, we continue to collectively obsess with ""having it all"" and work/life balance and who is or is not a ""working mother."" These so-called debates refuse to vanish and will continue to keep our attention as long as a June Cleaver version of motherhood is stuck in our heads.Rick Santorum got a bit of a pass on this recurring meme since he was very public about the time he took away from the campaign trail to be with his young daughter Bella, who has a condition called Trisomy 18, which occasionally requires her to be hospitalized. But at least we were talking about a portrait of modern fatherhood where a high-profile dad visibly took time for his young child who needed him.Whether you agree with the conservative politics of wunderkind Ryan or uber-mom Palin or not, one thing I would love to see change is the assumption that dads of small kids get a pass when it comes to the discussion of taking care of families. Or -- if they continue to get a pass -- then mothers of small children who run for office (or hold high level power jobs like Marissa Mayer) should get a pass, as well. Can we take our collective judgment about who should be taking care of the kids and refocus the conversation on these two questions: (1) How can we change policies so that mothers and fathers alike can take part in the obligations of child-rearing? and (2) Can we all agree that it's time to quit beating up on the mothers of America when it comes to this wide-ranging, ""all-having"" conversation?Joanne Bamberger is the author of the Amazon.com bestseller, Mothers of Intention: How Women and Social Media are Revolutionizing Politics in America, the first book to examine the rise of the political motherhood movement..

A Powerball official said most people take the one-time payout.""Absolutely everyone is talking about it,"" said Lapeer resident Ron Trandell, one of the customers at the suddenly busy gas station.He said people all over Lapeer were getting phone calls from relatives and friends who had heard that the winning ticket was sold in the town of 8,841 people 60 miles north of Detroit.""I've had nothing but phone calls this morning from people making sure it wasn't me,"" said Trandell. ""I told my wife we probably should stop answering the phone for a few days, just to make them wonder.""Jason Rutter, a U.S. postal worker in Lapeer, said the town was buzzing with talk of the mystery lottery winner.

That would net winnings of about $159 million.The Sunoco gas station where the winning ticket was sold will get $50,000.This week's jackpot was the seventh-largest for a U.S. lottery. Four of the six larger jackpots were split, so this week's winner will get the third-largest winning share ever.A Powerball ticket costs $2.Friday is the start of ""Lapeer Days,"" a three-day annual festival and carnival that began in 1902 that includes live bands, a parade, Wowie the Clown and, perhaps, a lottery winner walking its grounds in downtown Lapeer.

People are out of work, deeply in debt, and having their homes foreclosed. It's a grim picture.However, that is not an accurate picture of the whole country. The fact is that credit conditions vary radically from state to state. In an exclusive analysis, CardRatings.com looked at credit conditions in each of the 50 states, and found a considerable difference in the credit profiles of the best and worst states. While some states in the U.S. are struggling to provide jobs and financial support to their residents, there are states that are still thriving and even far exceeding national averages. When a residents' state could translate to extra income, better rates or superior employment opportunities, state lines become a game-changer.""It's very interesting to look at credit conditions at a state level. I think states in the lower credit tier could learn quite a bit from what states in the upper tier are doing right,"" said CardRatings.com founder Curtis Arnold. ""While we've made significant progress as a nation since the credit crunch a few years back, there is still more progress that needs to be made. This survey underscores the fact that the need is greater in certain areas of the country.""The 10 best states could benefit from the positive billing; some of these states cannot fill all of the jobs they have available. Providing jobs for those living in struggling areas who are willing to relocate would further strengthen these states' economies. The list of the 10 worst states does more than reflect the harsh economic climate for some; it could serve as a wake-up call to states on the fringes. The road to economic recovery looks much longer for those states, and for the people who reside in them. There is a stark difference in the credit profiles of the best and worst states for credit conditions, and that should be food for thought for anyone considering a move or business venture. The 10 best states for credit conditions1. North Dakota. This state may be the best-kept secret in the country. Can you imagine a place where unemployment is at 3.0 percent, credit scores are strong, and foreclosures rarely happen? All are true of North Dakota. This state had the strongest scores in three of five categories, and was fourth best out of the fifty states in the other two.2. Vermont. Vermont was second best in the nation in terms of low foreclosure and bankruptcy rates, and was among the ten best in all categories.3. South Dakota. While ranking in the top ten in all five categories, South Dakota actually beat its neighbor to the north when it came to average credit score.4. Montana. The only category where Montana slipped out of the top ten was for unemployment rate, but 6.4 percent is still much better than the national average.5. Iowa. Besides a very low rate of credit card delinquency, Iowans also enjoy low unemployment and a high average credit score.6. Nebraska. At 4.0 percent, Nebraska has the nation's second-lowest unemployment rate. It also scores very well for high credit scores and a low rate of credit card delinquency.7. Wyoming. Wyoming was among the ten best in every category except average credit score, where it placed in the middle of the pack.8. Hawaii. You can add the following to the list of reasons to go to Hawaii: low incidence of foreclosures, bankruptcies and credit card delinquencies.9. Minnesota. This state has the highest average credit score in the nation, though oddly enough, it does suffer from a relatively high foreclosure rate.10. Alaska. Judging from most of this list, there may be something about cold weather that keeps people on the straight and narrow. Alaska has the lowest bankruptcy rate in the country. Its only downfall is that its average credit score is lower than that of most states.The 10 worst states for credit conditions1. Nevada. It's pretty much a credit disaster across the board: Nevada ranked worst for unemployment, bankruptcy, and credit scores, and was among the ten worst in the two other categories as well.2. Georgia. Ranking among the worst five states in four out of five categories, and among the worst ten for the fifth category, Georgia's credit problems come in many different forms.3. Florida. Credit card delinquencies, foreclosures, and unemployment are all very high in Florida, while credit scores and bankruptcy rates aren't much better.4. Arizona. This is the second worst state of the union when it comes to foreclosure rate, and low credit scores are also a problem.5. California. Completing a sweep of the worst five by warm-weather states, California is the worst state of all for foreclosures. Unemployment and bankruptcy are also prominent problems on the left coast.6. Alabama. Its foreclosure and unemployment rates are about average, but Alabama's placement in the bottom ten for bankruptcies, credit scores, and credit card delinquencies was enough to land it among the nation's worst ten states overall for credit conditions.7. Mississippi. Being the worst state in the union for credit card delinquencies and second-worst for average credit score were enough to place Mississippi in the bottom ten overall, despite a relatively low foreclosure rate.8. Illinois. Illinois is about average when it comes to credit scores and the rate of credit card delinquencies, but it ranked in the bottom ten for each of the three other categories, resulting in a poor score overall.9. Indiana. Bankruptcies are the most acute problem in Indiana, and the state is below average in all other categories.10. Tennessee. The biggest problem for Tennessee is the bankruptcy rate, which is third-worst in the nation. In all other categories Tennessee is below average, but not among the ten worst.To see the full list of state rankings, see The best and worst states for credit: the full list.To determine state rankings, CardRatings.com analyzed indicators directly related to individual credit usage and repayment behavior as well as broad economic health indicators. The five categories analyzed were unemployment (Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 2012), personal bankruptcy rates (American Bankruptcy Institute), average credit score (Experian National Score Index), credit card delinquency rates (TransUnion) and home foreclosure rates (RealtyTrac). Tied total scores were resolved based on which state in the tie ranked highest in the most categories, and lowest in the fewest.This article originally appeared on www.CardRatings.com.

Most importantly? A work surface that offers plenty of room for getting tasks done, while not taking over a room. So whether you are returning back to school or just need a new functional yet stylish place to work at home, check out our buying guide for tips on choosing the best desk for your needs.Consider size and shape. The size of the desk affects your comfort and posture, and ultimately makes an impact on productivity levels. (After all, you can't possibly tackle your to-do list if you're hunched over.) A good desk height for the average person is 28"" to 30."" Your feet should be flat on the floor and your elbows should be a little higher than waist level for typing. It's also helpful to consider whether you will, in fact, be using a computer at this desk -- especially a desktop model, which takes up more surface area than a laptop. Rectangular desks are the most common, and corner models are great for space-saving, but round and oval options are available if your office area allows for them. If space is an issue, pick a mobile desk on wheels. Once you've completed everything on your to-do list you can roll it away into a closet and out of sight. Bottom line: Look for a height of 28""-30"" and choose a shape that fits your space.Consider Your Storage And Organizing Needs. While some people can work on just a table, storage for all of your office supplies is ideal for obvious reasons. Drawers, file storage or a hutch lets you stash your stuff without having to buy extra organizational gear. Many desks meant for computers and other equipment have built-in power cord organization to keep these unsightly wires out of your way, in addition to ledges for printers, copiers, or scanners. Bottom Line: Paying extra for built-in storage will save you money in the long run.Consider The Best Material. Modern desks are available in an array of finishes, so consider your work habits before heading to the store. Real wood can be very beautiful and add a rich look to your space, but it can be expensive and harder to maintain. (And if you drink your morning coffee at your desk, you may want to reconsider this material!) Laminate is affordable, durable, and comes in a variety of colors, or can even look like wood grain. While glass surfaces can look elegant, laptops and other gadgets may scratch them, so these are best for light use. Alternatively metal desks look modern and sleek and can take quite a bit of wear-and-tear. Bottom Line: Laminate or metal desks will stand up to everyday use.
