0,POLITICS,Why President Obama Is Wrong on Trade,"David Singh Grewal, ContributorProfessor of Law, Yale Law School",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-wrong-on-trade-tpp_b_7145984.html,"Can reasonable people disagree about the issues at hand in the TPP and TTIP? Absolutely. The president is wrong to suggest that his supporters in Congress and beyond are irresponsible when they question these agreements -- particularly given that his administration continues to keep them classified as a ""national security"" matter.",2015-04-26,"MCLEAN, VA - APRIL 24: US President Barack Obama speaks at a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the formation for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, at it's headquarters on April 24, 2015 in McClean, Virginia. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f413200000070201dc13.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"International Trade Law was surely not among the courses that President Obama taught as a law professor at the University of Chicago. In fact, I suspect he never took it as a student at Harvard Law School either. For, if he had, he couldn't have lashed out in the way he did at progressive opponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the massive new trade agreement currently being considered for ""fast track"" treatment by Congress.This Thursday, criticizing Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and others, the president compared their opposition to the trade deal to Sarah Palin's scaremongering about the ""death panels"" of Obamacare. He also complained that the constant calls from Congressional representatives and civil society groups to make public the now-classified draft agreement were getting on his ""nerves."" Judging from the tenor and substance of his comments, the president apparently thinks there is a clear and correct answer on trade policy -- such that opposing the TPP is either mendacious or very badly informed. And if you start from the familiar economic argument on behalf of free trade, that may seem plausible. But today's trade deals aren't about ""trade"" so much as about domestic regulation: how national laws concerning consumer safety, environmental protection, and labor rights will fare in the global marketplace. On these issues, at least, there aren't any easy answers.The economic argument on behalf of free trade is straightforward -- and has been reiterated time and again since its first formulation by early political economists, Adam Smith and David Ricardo. It says, in effect, that eliminating obstacles to the free movement of goods and services across borders allows gains from trade that make both parties better off, allowing each country to exploit its comparative advantage. While this assessment ignores distributional concerns within each country -- who gets how much as the national economies integrate -- the general view is that the winners will gain enough to be able to compensate the losers, at least in theory. Historically, the most obvious obstacles to free trade have been tariffs -- that is, taxes on imports -- along with export subsidies. These policy instruments have been the traditional target of international trade agreements, which sought to bring them down reciprocally. And across many decades of gradual, post-war economic integration, under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO), tariffs have been brought down -- in many sectors, almost eliminated.It's that familiar idea of why free trade is valuable and how trade agreements work that the president presumably has in mind when he criticizes the TPP's opponents as irresponsible. But the problem with the president's view is that tariffs are already at unprecedented lows -- indeed, in most industrial sectors, negligible. Today's trade agreements aren't really about reducing tariffs but something much more complex and consequential: harmonizing different national regulatory regimes, often to the advantage of powerful interests. For example, from what we have seen in leaked draft chapters of the TPP, U.S. negotiators have been pushing for stronger intellectual property laws -- to the benefit of U.S. corporations -- in ways that activists say would restrict free speech on the Internet by beefing up copyright protections. In fact, the text of the TPP Chapter on Intellectual Property repeats language borrowed from an earlier initiative, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Act, which was defeated after public opposition. Health experts have also expressed concern that stronger patent protections in the TPP would curtail access to essential medicines. It's true that there may be some good things in the TPP, and the president assures us that it is ""the most progressive trade agreement in our history."" But, on environmental issues for instance, according to the leaked TPP Chapter on the Environment, U.S. negotiators were apparently alone in the 12-nation bloc in trying to push for enforceable commitments -- and it is not known whether they succeeded. More generally, the draft text suggests that environmental measures should avoid ""the creation of unnecessary barriers to trade."" And here's the rub: who is to decide whether limits on pesticide residue in food or laws protecting biodiversity constitute ""unnecessary barriers""? From what we have seen in leaked chapters of the TPP, it may be specially convened arbitral panels -- small groups of outside experts -- rather the normal judicial channels used in each country. The justification for these special panels will be that no national government can be trusted not to rule in its own favor when its regulatory laws come into conflict with its obligations under the TPP. But that justification should come as a warning -- that the ordinary democratic process will also be up for grabs.Can reasonable people disagree about these issues? Absolutely. The president is wrong to suggest that his supporters in Congress and beyond are irresponsible when they question these agreements -- particularly given that his administration continues to keep them classified as a ""national security"" matter. The president's testiness on this issue likely comes because the TPP -- and its sister agreement with Europe, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) -- represent not just the culmination of several years of negotiations with foreign allies, but also what may be the president's last chance to pass significant new legislation before his second term ends. None of this should matter, however, if the TPP is a bad deal for consumer safety, the environment, labor, or the democratic process. And at this point, we simply don't know what the negotiated text will contain -- even though the president is demanding that Congress provide him fast track authority to ensure an up or down vote on the agreement later this year. All we have now is the president's assurance that the TPP is ""progressive"" -- and his irritability and condescension toward those who wish to know more.But even without the negotiated texts, we do know something. The TPP simply can't be the kind of simple, lift-all-boats agreement that the president implies when defending the deal. Trade agreements simply aren't like that anymore -- and they haven't been for almost two decades. They concern who wins and who loses, at home and abroad, when national regulatory regimes are put under pressure by economic globalization.The members of Congress now balking at fast track understand that the TPP will be about much more than trade. The president shouldn't insult them for pointing it out.________________David Singh Grewal is an Associate Professor at Yale Law School, where he teaches international trade law."
1,ARTS,Equity's Union-Busting Tactics,"Hoyt Hilsman, ContributorAuthor, journalist and former Congressional candidate",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/equitys-union-busting-tactics_b_7144370.html,"It's a perfect example of ""divide and conquer"" that will ultimately lead to the decline of L.A. theater.

But, in this case, Equity may end up busting up its own union.""Divide and conquer"" has been the strategy of anti-labor movements for years. The trick is to peel off support from a grassroots movement by offering to compromise on issues that benefit a portion of the movement, but weakens the larger group. For example, Equity modified its original proposal to prevent new members from joining the so-called membership companies -- groups of actors who formed their own theaters companies. Equity's ""new"" rule permits those companies to accept new members, but does not allow actors to form new membership companies.It's a perfect example of ""divide and conquer"" that will ultimately lead to the decline of L.A. theater. Why? Because talented young actors, fresh out of drama school or college, will be unable to form their own companies with their colleagues. No more actors like Tim Robbins forming the Actors Gang, or ACT graduates starting Noise Within, or a host of other companies. Equity supporters point to the 50-seat ""showcase"" code as an opportunity for startups, but who can imagine paying the rent or utility bills with only 50 seats to fill -- it's practically impossible already with 99 seats. And, to make matters worse, under the proposed ""showcase"" code, actors are prohibited from forming non-profit corporations to raise funds. In effect, it means that the next generation of talented, energetic young actors will not be able to form companies that present imaginative and inventive theater in L.A. In a recent piece in the Los Angeles Times, theater critic Charles McNulty disagreed with the notion that Equity has been ""ignoring its members and of setting out to destroy the city's unique ecosystem of small theater,"" and he questioned the value of L.A.'s small theater scene as ""a flourishing hotbed of experiment."" As the sole remaining full-time newspaper theater critic in L.A., it is understandable that McNulty would take that view. His beat is essentially the major and mid-sized theaters in town, with trips to New York, Orange County and San Diego to cover the larger theater venues. So, his experience with L.A.'s smaller theater scene is limited, as he himself admits.McNulty's hope, which he concedes may be a ""critic's pipe dream,"" is that mid-size institutions could develop that offer adventurous plays not currently found in L.A.'s larger theaters and, at the same time, attract audiences and ultimately become profitable enough to pay their actors a living (not a minimum) wage. Unfortunately, McNulty's dream, while admirable, is indeed a pipe dream. There is no indication that L.A. audiences would support many more of the mid-sized venues he envisions, nor is there much appetite for theatrical producers or even actor-based companies to take the extraordinary leap into the mid-sized minefield.There is also a fundamental misconception of the role of a labor union in all this. Labor unions are organized for one simple purpose -- to represent their members. They are not there to create or alter the landscape of the marketplace or even to promote higher goals like creating a more vibrant artistic environment. That is the job of the artists, who are the creators, after all. So when a labor union defies a two-thirds vote of its local membership to pursue its own leadership's agenda, it has failed in its core task.It is difficult to predict where this dispute will lead. The most likely outcome is some negotiated legal agreement which begins with the terms of a legally binding settlement signed almost 30 years ago establishing the 99-seat theater plan. That must be the starting point for any changes in the rules for L.A. theater, not an arbitrary ruling by a national leadership council that appears to have little understanding of L.A. theater, and even less ability to effectively communicate with and represent its membership.A more ominous outcome would be a splitting of a union that has been in existence for more than one hundred years. This would not be unprecedented, since many unions that abandoned their membership were soon abandoned themselves. Unfortunately, Equity has been made serious missteps before, when it tried to stifle the Off-Broadway movement in the 1950s and the Off-Off-Broadway movement in 1960s, both of which represented periods of grassroots creative renaissance and produced some of the most important works and institutions in American theater. Hopefully, the Equity leadership will not continue to stand in the way of the continued creative blossoming of the Los Angeles theater community."
2,EDUCATION,Stand Up for Sleep-Deprived Students,"Vicki Abeles, ContributorDirector, Race to Nowhere & Beyond Measure",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stand-up-for-sleep-deprived-students_b_7146654.html,"For growing teens, this daily trudge is more than a minor annoyance. Countless studies and medical experts are sounding the alarm (no pun intended): Insufficient sleep is endangering our students' health and learning.",2015-04-26,2015-04-26-1430063824-6846501-Stocksy_txpe9c6c733bwO000_Small_195113.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-26-1430063824-6846501-Stocksy_txpe9c6c733bwO000_Small_195113-thumb.jpg,"It's no secret that teenagers love their sleep. A groggy high-schooler reaching for the snooze button is a morning ritual in my home, and many others across the country. Here's what else is commonplace: Many middle and high schools across the country start the school day at 7:30 a.m. or earlier. For students, this means waking up earlier than most adults are required to do for their jobs. And for growing teens, this daily trudge is more than a minor annoyance. Countless studies and medical experts are sounding the alarm (no pun intended): Insufficient sleep is endangering our students' health and learning. Last month, the National Association of School Nurses and the Society of Pediatric Nurses joined the American Academy of Pediatrics in a vital policy recommendation that middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m. to accommodate natural sleep cycles (teens are biologically programmed to stay up later and wake up later). They note that 87 percent of high school students are chronically sleep-deprived, and such regular sleep deprivation is putting our children at greater risk of depression, anxiety and obesity, as well as fatigue-related accidents and injuries. It's also undermining their concentration and performance in school.The American Academy of Pediatrics suggested that the reason for teens' lack of sleep are complex. The fact is that for most students the ""school day"" doesn't end at 3 p.m. Many of them are engaged in school-sponsored extracurricular activities, after-school jobs and mounds of homework that keep them up late into the evening. The teens in my home finish their ""work day"" long after my husband and I do. For such reasons, fixing the problem of student exhaustion is also complex. We need to reexamine the demands that our education system places on students -- from homework loads to extracurricular obligations. But changing school start times is a good place to start because the potential benefits are well documented. For example, in a three-year study, schools that pushed back start times saw an increase in student performance and attendance, and a decrease in student tardiness, substance abuse and depression symptoms.Health care professionals are not the only group calling for later start times. Policymakers are taking heed, too. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren introduced a bill this March -- the Zzz's to A's Act -- that would direct the Secretary of Education to study the effects of later start times on high school students' health and academic performance and submit those findings to Congress. This is a good step forward, but I believe that the biggest impact is going to come from the people who know our groggy teens best -- our parents and school communities. I have seen the potential for grassroots change firsthand. After my first film, Race to Nowhere, uncovered the ways our pressure-cooker education culture is taking a toll on student well-being, communities used it as a platform to advocate for school policies that put student health first, including healthier homework practices and school schedule reforms. We want to see these change take hold at a national level. That's why the Race to Nowhere team has launched a new Sleep Campaign, which includes a tool kit, fact sheets and other inspiration to help people advocate for later school start times and spread awareness of the health and learning benefits of doing so. For the first time, we're also making Race To Nowhere instantly available on iTunes to help families grow the conversation about school schedules (and overall student health and learning) in their homes and communities. Teens love (and need) their sleep, and we love our teens. Let's stand up for what they deserve: a good night's rest."

9,FIFTY,How to Talk to Your Elderly Parent About the Dangers of Falling,"Jim T.

But even falls without a major injury can cause seniors to become fearful or depressed, making it difficult for them to stay active.",2015-04-26,2015-04-26-1430074001-322550-longtermhealthcare.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-26-1430074001-322550-longtermhealthcare-thumb.jpg,"Watching an elderly parent's health decline is never easy, but for many adult children, like Patty Cicione of Norton, Mass., having conversations about a parent's vulnerabilities, health and well-being in their later years can be equally difficult. ""Mom was 74 years old, living alone in the two-story house that she had built 50 years earlier with my dad,"" Cicione said. She was becoming frail, forgetful and increasingly unsteady on her feet. I was worried that if she fell and broke a hip or something else, she might never recover or end up in a nursing home for the rest of her life. It's an unfortunate reality, but every year, one in three older Americans fall, making it the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries for seniors age 65 and older. A simple fall can cause a serious hip fracture, broken bone or head injury, which can lead to hospital stays, disability, loss of independence and even death. But even falls without a major injury can cause seniors to become fearful or depressed, making it difficult for them to stay active.If you have concerns about an aging parent or other loved one's risk of falling, have a talk with them and offer your support. Most falls can be prevented and injuries averted with just a few simple preventative steps. If you need help broaching this sometimes-difficult topic with your parent, use this article as a prompter, and consider the following tips. Start by taking the time to sit down and have a thoughtful, direct conversation, and if you have siblings, consider getting them involved too, so your parent will know everyone in the family is concerned. Tell your parent that even though they are okay now, you're worried about their future safety if they were to fall and injure themselves and no one was around to help. And, let them know the unsettling statistic that nearly 30 percent of U.S. seniors who fall suffer moderate to severe injuries that can make it hard to get around or live independently in their own home, and can increase their risk of an early death. Be respectful with your comments, and try to avoid being bossy or over dramatic. And listen to your parent's thoughts, concerns or fears that they express. If you need some help, contact your parent's doctor to see if they could examine your mom or dad and talk to them about falls. Many seniors will often listen to their doctor before they will listen to their own family. After you get your parent's attention, here are six tips your parent and you can implement that can help keep them safe.Start exercising: Weak leg muscles and poor balance are two of the biggest risk factors that cause seniors to fall. Tai chi, walking, water aerobics and strength training are all good for improving balance and strength, as are a number of simple balance exercises that your parent can do anytime, like standing on one foot for 30 seconds then switching to the other foot, and walking heel-to-toe across the room. For additional balance and leg strengthening exercises, the National Institute on Aging offers free exercise guides and a DVD that you can order at Go4Life.nia.nih.gov, or call at 800-222-2225.Review medications: Does your parent take any medicine or combination of medicines that make him or her dizzy, sleepy or lightheaded? If so, gather up all the drugs they take -- prescriptions and over-the-counter -- and take them to their doctor or pharmacist for a drug review and adjustment. Note that many blood pressure medications, anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, anti-seizure drugs, antipsychotic drugs, diuretics, sedatives, tranquilizers, some painkillers and over-the-counter drugs that cause drowsiness are common culprits in medication-related falls. Get an eye exam: Poor vision can be another contributor to falls, so get your parent's eyes checked every year. They may be wearing the wrong glasses or have developed a condition such as glaucoma or cataracts that make it harder to see obstacles on the floor. Your parent should also wear single-vision glasses while out on walks, because bifocal and progressive lenses can make depth perception more difficult and cause missteps.Modify their home: There are also a number of simple household modifications you can do to make your parent's living area safer. Start by arranging or moving the furniture so there are clear pathways to walk through, and by picking up items on the floor that could cause him or her to trip, like newspapers, shoes, clothes, electrical or phone cords. If they have throw rugs, remove them or use double-sided tape to secure them. In the bathroom, buy some non-skid rugs for the floors, and a rubber suction-grip mat or adhesive non-skid tape for the floor of the tub or shower to prevent slipping, and have a carpenter install grab bars in and around the tub/shower and near the toilet for support. For even greater safety, purchase a shower chair and install a hand-held shower so your parent can bathe from a seated position. Also, increase lighting throughout the house, and purchase some plug-in night lights for the bathrooms, hallways and stairways that automatically turn on when it's dark. And if your parent has stairs, put handrails on both sides. For more tips, the Eldercare Locater offers a Preventing Falls at Home brochure that provides a room-by-room checklist. Or, get an occupational therapist to come in and assess their home for fall risks. Medicare will pay for this service if prescribed by a doctor. Choose safe footwear: Your parent should be aware that going barefoot or wearing slippers or socks at home can also cause falls, as can wearing backless shoes, high-heels, and shoes with smooth leather soles. The safest option are rubber-soled, low-heeled shoes that fit well and support their feet.Purchase some helpful aids: If your parent needs some help with balance or walking, talk to their doctor or a physical therapist about getting fit for a cane or walker. Some other helpful aids include a reacher-grabber tool that lets your parent retrieve lightweight items from high shelves, and pick up objects off the floor so they don't have to bend over. And a cordless phone that they could carry around from room to room, so when the phone rings they don't have to rush to answer it, therefore averting a fall.It's also important to realize that even with all these preventative measures, not all falls can be prevented. To help ensure your parent's safety, and provide you some peace of mind, consider getting them a medical alert device. This is a wearable pendent button -- usually in the form of a necklace pendent, wristband or belt clip -- so if your parent were to fall or need assistance, at the press of a button, they could call and talk to a trained operator who would find out what's wrong, and notify family members, a neighbor, friend or emergency services as needed. Bay Alarm Medical offers some the most affordable medical alert devices on the market today that provides help at home and away from home. Costs range between $22 and $30 per month."

They fell short to the Nets, 91-83, but continue to lead the first-round series 2-1.“We’re trying to keep our routine and everything -- on the court, off the court -- as close to normal as possible,” Atlanta head coach Mike Budenholzer said before the game when asked if the team’s routine changed at all during this trip to the city.“We miss Thabo,” he said, but added, “We’ve got guys who are very mature, very responsible.”“I think they’re all in a good place, they know how important what’s happening is, and we’re just going about our business,” Budenholzer said of the series.The injury ended the season for Sefolosha, who did not travel with the team to New York. Sefolosha, along with his teammate Pero Antic, were both arrested in the early hours of April 8 as they were exiting New York club 1OAK. That same evening, Chris Copeland of the Indiana Pacers and his girlfriend had both been stabbed, and later taken to the hospital.The NYPD said Antic and Sefolosha were resisting arrest and obstructing the investigation into the Copeland incident, which occurred earlier that night. However, both players pushed back against that account, and in the days that followed, a damning cell phone video was leaked that appeared to show a police officer using a baton against Sefolosha.The NYPD launched an internal investigation into the situation, and both the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association have called on the police department to provide more information as they too look into the arrests. Just over two weeks later, Sefolosha’s teammates said he is missed, but they are maintaining business as usual while facing off against Brooklyn, which includes any pre-game routines. “We play a lot of FIFA. That’s what we do on the road, so that doesn’t really change. We play Uno,” Atlanta’s Kent Bazemore told The Huffington Post. “Nothing changed.”“Hasn’t had an impact,” forward Paul Millsap told HuffPost. “Situation’s a tough situation, especially for Thabo, we feel for him. He’s a big part of our team, but we let it play out, see what happens with the league.”But neither player would comment on the investigation itself. “Not at all. Not at all. It’s not my judgment, not my call, so I stay out of it,” Millsap said when asked if he had any thoughts on the video and police comments.Bazemore would only say, “It’s a legal matter.”However, Sefolosha’s own run-in with the police follows a year of high-profile cases in which controversial police aggression was used, including that leading to the deaths of Missouri teen Michael Brown and Eric Garner of New York.A vocal critic of both those deaths sat across from the Hawks on Saturday: Nets point guard Jarrett Jack. Jack, who organized “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirts to be worn by some players earlier this season before a Nets-Cavaliers game, said Sefolosha’s case could perhaps continue to shed light on what has been a hotly debated topic.“I think with the added celebrity to his name and what he’s affiliated with as far as being an NBA player, is going to bring much more attention to it than maybe your typical civilian,” Jack told HuffPost.He continued: “You wouldn’t want that to be the way that it happens ... but if it starts to get the ball rolling in a positive way, then so be it.”Jack, while skeptical of the details surrounding Sefolosha’s arrest, also stopped short of a full-throated condemnation of the officers.“None of us were there, we don’t know what went on before the video started to be filmed, but I don’t know, it’s just difficult for me to understand why nine people had to take down one guy that didn’t seem to be, like, resisting, to me,” the Nets player said. Since Sefolosha’s arrest and injury, many players have expressed concern, including Cleveland’s J.R. Smith -- known for his New York social life while playing for the Knicks -- who said players need to be careful while out late at night.Jack agreed. “I think we all have a responsibility to ... protect ourselves in a way, to understand that you are a commodity, and that you’re an asset to your family, to the companies you represent,” Jack said. “And just make sure you try to get yourself back home and safe and sound as possible.” "

It seems unlikely, considering that since their ""Full House"" days, the two have moved on from show business to become fashion industry powerhouses. But Lori Loughlin, who played Aunt Becky on the hit show, has an idea of who could take on the role of Michelle: the twins' younger sister, and recent movie star in her own right, Elizabeth Olsen.""I couldn't pick anyone -- maybe their younger sister Lizzie!"" she said in an exclusive Us Weekly video. ""That would be fun right? She would take over the role. They are all beautiful. They have good genes!""The younger Olsen sibling has displayed her acting chops in films like ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" and ""Liberal Arts."" But while viewers would surely love to see an Olsen as Michelle, it also doesn't seem that likely that she'd leave a burgeoning film career to play a character her sisters originated in a '90s sitcom reboot.The Olsen twins, meanwhile, were apparently unaware of the plans until the news was announced.“We just found out about it today,” Mary-Kate said to Women’s Wear Daily on April 21. “I guess we’re going to talk to the creators and see what’s happening.”"

(Right) Garment workers and activists participate in a May Day rally in Dhaka, Bangladesh last year.Unlike the rest of the world's democracies, the United States doesn't use the metric system, doesn't require employers to provide workers with paid vacations, hasn't abolished the death penalty and doesn't celebrate May Day as an official national holiday.But outside the U.S., May 1 is international workers' day, observed with speeches, rallies and demonstrations. This year, millions of workers in Europe, Asia and Latin America will be taking to the streets to demand higher wages, better benefits and improved working conditions. In Bangladesh, for example, protestors will be in the streets to demand that global companies like Walmart improve safety standards in local sweatshops, which have become death traps. In San Francisco and Oakland, the local chapter of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union has vowed to shut down the two ports next Friday, May 1, to protest police brutality. In a statement, the union said, ""It is fitting that on May Day, International Workers Day, Bay Area ports will be shut down to protest the racist police killing of mainly black and brown people."" In 2008, the same union chapter shut down Pacific Coast ports to demand an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This year, May Day arrives amid a growing protest movement against police abuses in cities around the country. Not surprisingly, many May Day rallies will focus attention on this issue to link demands for civil rights, immigrants' rights, and workers' rights. The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor is sponsoring a May Day rally at Dragon's Gate in Chinatown, calling for a $15 an hour wage, justice in communities of color, and no more delays for DACA/DAPA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents).Ironically, the May Day celebration of working-class solidarity was started by the U.S. labor movement and soon spread around the world, but it has never earned official recognition in this country. Progressives around the country, working on a variety of issues, have embraced the new May Day movement. It isn't just about workers rights on the job, or immigrant rights, or civil rights, or even about raising the standard of living for all workers. It's about what kind of country we want to be.The original May Day was born of the movement for an eight-hour workday. After the Civil War, unregulated capitalism ran rampant in America. It was the Gilded Age, a time of merger mania, increasing concentration of wealth and growing political influence by corporate power brokers known as Robber Barons. New technologies made possible new industries, which generated great riches for the fortunate few, but at the expense of workers, many of them immigrants, who worked long hours, under dangerous conditions, for little pay.As the gap between the rich and other Americans widened dramatically, workers began to resist in a variety of ways. The first major wave of labor unions pushed employers to limit the workday to 10, then eight, hours. The 1877 strike by tens of thousands of railroad, factory and mine workers -- which shut down the nation's major industries and was brutally suppressed by the corporations and their friends in government -- was the first of many mass actions to demand living wages and humane working conditions. By 1884, the campaign had gained enough momentum that the predecessor to the American Federation of Labor adopted a resolution at its annual meeting, ""that eight hours shall constitute legal day's labor from and after May 1, 1886.""On the appointed date, unions and radical groups orchestrated strikes and large-scale demonstrations in cities across the country. More than 500,000 workers went on strike or marched in solidarity and many more people protested in the streets. In Chicago, a labor stronghold, at least 30,000 workers struck. Rallies and parades across the city more than doubled that number, and the May 1 demonstrations continued for several days. The protests were mostly nonviolent, but they included skirmishes with strikebreakers, company-hired thugs and police. On May 3, at a rally outside the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company factory, police fired on the crowd, killing at least two workers. The next day, at a rally at Haymarket Square to protest the shootings, police moved in to clear the crowd. Someone threw a bomb at the police, killing at least one officer. Another seven policemen were killed during the ensuing riot, and police gunfire killed at least four protesters and injured many others.After a controversial investigation, seven anarchists were sentenced to death for murder, while another was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The anarchists won global notoriety, being seen as martyrs by many radicals and reformers, who viewed the trial and executions as politically motivated.Within a few years, unions and radical groups around the world had established May Day as an international holiday to commemorate the Haymarket martyrs and continue the struggle for the eight-hour day, workers' rights and social justice.In the United States, however, the burgeoning Knights of Labor, uneasy with May Day's connection to anarchists and other radicals, adopted another day to celebrate workers' rights. In 1887, Oregon was the first state to make Labor Day an official holiday, celebrated in September. Other states soon followed. Unions sponsored parades to celebrate Labor Day, but such one-day festivities didn't make corporations any more willing to grant workers decent conditions. To make their voices heard, workers had to resort to massive strikes, typically put down with brutal violence by government troops.In 1894, the American Railway Union, led by Eugene Debs, went on strike against the Pullman Palace Car Company to demand lower rents (Pullman was a company town that owned its employees' homes) and higher pay following huge layoffs and wage cuts. In solidarity with the Pullman workers, railroad workers across the country boycotted the trains with Pullman cars, paralyzing the nation's economy as well as its mail service. President Grover Cleveland declared the strike a federal crime and called out 12,000 soldiers to break the strike. They crushed the walkout and killed at least two protesters. Six days later, Cleveland -- facing worker protests for his repression of the Pullman strikers -- signed a bill creating Labor Day as an official national holiday in September. He hoped that giving the working class a day off to celebrate one Monday a year might pacify them.For most of the 20th century, Labor Day was reserved for festive parades, picnics and speeches sponsored by unions in major cities. But contrary to what President Cleveland had hoped, American workers, their families and allies, found other occasions to mobilize for better working conditions and a more humane society. America witnessed massive strike waves throughout the century, including militant general strikes and occupations in 1919 (including a general strike in Seattle), during the Depression (the 1934 San Francisco general strike, led by the longshoremen's union; a strike of about 400,000 textile workers that same year; and militant sit-down strikes by autoworkers in Flint, Michigan, women workers at Woolworth's department stores in New York, aviation workers in Los Angeles and others in 1937) and 1946 (which witnessed the largest strike wave in U.S. history, triggered by pent-up demands following World War II). The feminist, civil rights, environmental and gay rights movements drew important lessons from these labor tactics.Meanwhile, May 1 faded away as a day of protest. From the 1920s through the 1950s, radical groups, including the Communist Party, sought to keep the tradition alive with parades and other events, but the mainstream labor movement and most liberal organizations kept their distance, making May Day an increasingly marginal affair. In 1958, in the midst of the cold war, President Dwight Eisenhower proclaimed May 1 as Loyalty Day. Each subsequent president has issues a similar proclamation, although few Americans know about or celebrate the day.In 2001, however, unions and immigrant rights groups in Los Angeles resurrected May Day as an occasion for protest. The first few years saw rallies with several hundred participants, but in 2006 the numbers skyrocketed. That year, millions of people in over 100 cities -- including more than a million in Los Angeles, 200,000 in New York and 300,000 in Chicago -- participated in May Day demonstrations.The huge turnout was catalyzed by a bill, sponsored by Representative James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wisconsin) and passed by the House the previous December, that would have classified as a felon anyone who helped undocumented immigrants enter or remain in the United States. In many cities, the protest, which organizers termed the ""Great American Boycott,"" triggered walkouts by high school students and shut down businesses that depended on immigrant workers. Since then, immigrant workers and their allies have adopted May Day as an occasion for protest.America is now in the midst of a new Gilded Age with a new group of corporate Robber Barons, many of them operating on a global scale. The top of the income scale has the biggest concentration of income and wealth since 1928. Several decades of corporate-backed assaults on unions have left only seven percent of private sector employees with union cards. More than half of America's 15 million union members now work for government (representing 37 percent of all government employees), so business groups and conservative politicians have targeted public sector unions for destruction.Attacks during the past few years on teachers, cops, firefighters, human service workers and other public sector workers -- in Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and elsewhere -- the most ferocious anti-union crusade in decades -- have catalyzed a tremendous sense of urgency among union workers and millions of other Americans who've seen their standard of living plummet while the richest Americans and big business plunder the economy. Tens of millions of American working families are suffering, with new waves of lay-offs and foreclosures, exacerbated by severe cutbacks to government services.But we've also seen a resurgence of activism among the ranks of low-wage workers. The past few years have seen an explosion of worker unrest, especially among Walmart employees, workers at fast-food chains, janitors, and hospital workers, demanding that employers pay them a living wage. Just three years ago, the idea of a $15/hour minimum wage was considered a crazy notion. But in 2014, Seattle passed a citywide minimum wage at that level that included an annual cost-of-living adjustment. This ""radical"" idea has now become almost mainstream. A national poll conducted last January found that 75 percent of Americans support raising the federal minimum wage to $12.50 by 2020, including 92 percent of Democrats, 73 percent of Independents, 53 percent of Republicans. And 63 percent of Americans support an even greater federal minimum wage increase to $15.00 by 2020In a growing number of cities, local elected officials are proposing local minimum wage laws. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is backing a citywide minimum wage of $13.25 an hour by 2017, while almost half of LA's City Council supports a $15 an hour minimum wage. Democrats in Congress are now rallying behind the idea raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $12 an hour -- something that would have been unthinkable just a year or two ago. These dramatic changes in so short a time didn't happen by accident. They are a culmination of years of grassroots activism. Although May Day may not be an official holiday in the United States, it is nevertheless an important part of this country's tradition. This year's May Day rallies will continue that American tradition of dissent and protest for a more humane society.

But candidates face a dilemma there: Do they emphasize the socially conservative principles that play well with Iowa's more conservative Republican electorate? Or do they stress a more mainstream conservatism that might play better later in the campaign?Gay marriage is a particularly thorny issue, especially with the U.S. Supreme Court set to hear oral arguments this week in a legal challenge to laws prohibiting same-sex unions.Overall, 50 percent of Americans now support gay marriage, according to data from Reuters/Ipsos, with 34 percent opposing it and 16 percent unsure. Still, according to polling from the Pew Research Center, nearly 70 percent of white evangelicals oppose gay marriage, and in 2012, about 57 percent of Republican voters in the Iowa caucuses described themselves as evangelical Christians. COURTING CONSERVATIVESA win in Iowa, or even a high placement, gives a candidate more visibility as the race moves on to other states, but it is no guarantee of later success. In 2008 and 2012, the top spots in the Republican contest were taken by former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, respectively, neither of whom went on to get the party's nomination.Still, Republicans hopefuls, including some familiar faces, remain eager to court Iowa conservatives.""We are moving rapidly toward the criminalization of Christianity,"" Huckabee said in conference call with conservative pastors organized by the Family Research Council, a Christian public policy organization. An audio recording of the call was obtained and posted online by Right Wing Watch, a progressive group that criticizes conservatives.Huckabee picked up the thread again on Saturday.""Let me be clear tonight: I'm not backing off because what I'm saying is true,"" he said. His words were greeted with murmurs of ""That's right"" from the crowd, along with strong applause.Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker echoed the warning. ""We should be standing up for religious freedom,"" he said at Saturday's forum. ""In America, we should be the shining star that says you should be able to practice your religion.""Two prominent potential Republican contenders were missing at the Faith and Freedom gathering: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Both are perceived as being from the party's more moderate wing. Bush has argued for comprehensive immigration reform, and Christie, as governor of New Jersey, ultimately opted not to appeal a court decision that legalized gay marriage in his state.A more moderate stance, especially on gay marriage, may resonate particularly with young voters. Among 18-to-29-year-olds, according to Reuters/Ipsos, 76 percent now support gay marriage. Even among Republicans in that age group, same-sex marriage enjoys 51 percent support.Raymond Starks, a 21-year-old student at Drake University who interned on Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, said on Saturday he favored same-sex marriage, although he also valued religious liberty.""I would support laws allowing for conscientious objection in some circumstances,"" he said.

Oxfam teams are on ground in Nepal with more staff and relief supplies flying in. I'd like to share this post which was shared with us in response, by Shaheen Chughtai, Oxfam's Deputy Head of Humanitarian Policy and Campaigns.Kathmandu was ever a disaster-in-waiting. The densely populated capital of one of the world's poorest countries clings to the slopes of the seismically unstable Himalayas. The city was near-leveled and 8,500 killed in its last great earthquake 81 years before. It had history. On Saturday, the long-feared calamity struck.I first arrived in Kathmandu in 2007 to begin a new job with Oxfam. I'd been with Oxfam two years earlier and 1000 kilometers west along the Himalayas, part of the international aid effort following the Kashmir earthquake. I saw towns there razed by the shifting tectonic plates that lie beneath that mountain range. More than 75,000 people were killed then, 85,000 injured, and more than three million made homeless. With the Kashmir tragedy fresh in my mind, I remember looking at the thousands of flimsy shacks and hovels lining Kathmandu's dusty slums and the sturdier, but still precarious, multi-tiered family homes, and the cheaply-built apartment blocks and ornate temples that collectively give the city its colorful distinctive appearance. We all understood and feared what a big earthquake would surely do there.But Kathmandu was fundamentally flawed by more than just its violent geology. A million-plus people are crammed inside it. Half of Nepal's 28 million population don't have access to improved sanitation and live below the poverty line, around one-in-three of them in severe poverty. All this was true, even before this latest earthquake. Their ability to cope with a major disaster is quite crippled by the lack of the kind of economic and social infrastructure that people in richer nations take for granted. Many thousands of Nepalese are going to need a great deal of help.Nepal has long been desperate for a huge, sustained investment to strengthen its physical infrastructure in order to keep its people safer, and to develop its economy and services so that local communities and the state had enough assets to fall back on. The challenge now will be to invest the out-pouring of international aid -- which certainly will come -- into a rescue, recovery and eventual reconstruction effort that will do exactly that. Such an effort in the near-term will be extremely challenging. As I write, many of my Oxfam colleagues in Kathmandu are preparing to bed down with the rest of the city's inhabitants for their second night in the cold, under the stars. Terrifying aftershocks that continue to shake a structurally damaged city mean that it's too risky to sleep with a solid roof over one's head. We are trying to talk to our staff and friends, but the phone and digital services are weak, and in many cases, broken. A few old friends with electricity generators have managed to keep in touch via Facebook, telling of the previous sleepless night amid the aftershocks.Communications are so vital for workers to coordinate relief and aid, so the ability of medical and engineering staff to work easily is likely to be severely hampered. We have staff on their way from India and around the world -- and tons of relief supplies now readied in our warehouses including in Bicester, UK -- prepared to fly in to provide more capacity to our country team and aid for a traumatized population.But the airport was closed, roads and bridges damaged and tons of rubble are blocking the streets and alleys of Kathmandu. Water supply pipes, electricity generating sub-stations, bridges, treatment plants -- all these things will be affected, and food, water, fuel and medicines will be immediately in short-supply. From today, people will start skipping meals and to rely on friends and relatives for support. Some will be moving to areas they consider more safe, where they will set up camps. Others will choose to stay close to their belongings and shattered homes, perhaps waiting for missing relatives. They will start selling assets in ""distress sales."" They will use what food, cash and property they have just to get by. They will start borrowing. Many poor Nepalese will already be in debt.All these contingencies and actions are described in Oxfam's program plans for exactly this kind of eventuality. Our country team has been preparing for them for years.Oxfam has invested a lot of time, effort and resources over the years on working with partner groups in Nepal on what we call ""disaster risk reduction"" programs. All of this work that we have done together will be severely tested over the coming days and weeks and months. I know many of these groups as knowledgeable, networked and committed from having working alongside them. The NRCS Disaster Management Department works on search and rescue, first aid, shelter and water and sanitation; the Centre for Disaster Management works similarly; DPNET works on information and coordination; we have worked with the National Centre for Earthquake Technology. Oxfam has a significant network of dozens of partner organizations that will be swinging behind the government and donors' efforts in support. But in the first night since the earthquake struck, of course, all these same men and women, and their children too, have been sleeping out in the open. The challenge of mounting a coordinated aid effort led and directed by local officials and organizations will be huge.Nepal and Kathmandu will benefit from much international goodwill. The interest of governments and citizens from donor countries to help will be substantial, as always most especially on the back of television and social media. The UK and the Commonwealth countries have historical and geopolitical ties to Nepal. The country is a popular tourist destination in the shadow of Mt. Everest and the Himalayan mountains. Its Gurkha soldiery are famous. We would expect China, India, the Gulf States, the U.S. and European countries, and countries in Asia particularly in East Asia, and the Pacific to show a strong outpouring of commitment and cash to aid the stricken capital of Nepal and its people. In the mean time, however, local people -- medical staff, local officials, local aid workers and affected communities -- will be striving to help each other while trying to make sense of the chaos and destruction.""Please support Oxfam's Nepal earthquake response.

Ivy League education. Top-notch work experience. Strong referrals. Rationally, all signs suggested I should hire him. And yet, I felt what can only be described as a ""tap on the shoulder"" -- an intuitive, but impossible-to-pinpoint feeling that something was off. That's when I made the mistake. I listened to my mind over my gut and hired him anyway.Shortly after he joined the team, this paper-perfect candidate started to complain. Whether it was the inconvenient commute, disagreements with colleagues, or frustration with the senior management's strategy, he was never satisfied. He consistently demanded time from his manager and had a negative attitude that brought others in the organization down. I learned the hard way that a single disgruntled employee could wreak havoc on a company. Although highly competent, his unhappiness spread like a cancer. Because of his leadership role, his negativity trickled down, proliferating an attitude that seriously damaged productivity.Looking back, I realize my gut was trying to alert me to subtle red flags during the interview process. First, the candidate had two short stints at excellent companies. The moves alone were not concerning. However, it was troubling that, when I asked him his reason for leaving, he was quick to point blame at his previous managers and organizations. One bad work experience is not unusual, but if a candidate has had several negative experiences, alarm bells should go off.Second, I incorrectly dismissed the fact that many of the questions he asked during the interview focused more on personal career objectives than on how he could contribute to the company's mission. Asking, ""when should I expect to get promoted if I exceed your expectations?"" is not unreasonable, but can indicate that a candidate values personal objectives above all else. This doesn't mean I don't want ambitious employees with their own personal goals; but I now look to hire people who are equally motivated by helping their company and team succeed. For employees who genuinely want to please and who look for ways to help others perform better, raises and promotions happen naturally. In my experience, the best employees are positive, low maintenance and unselfish. When interviewing candidates now, I try to filter for these qualities. I ask why they left their jobs and where they went next. I want to really understand how candidates make their decisions. To dive deeper, I ask them to rank their managers and level of happiness at previous jobs on a scale of 1-10. Someone who repeatedly gives low scores is likely going to be someone who is difficult to please. Finally, I ask them about their biggest professional accomplishment. I look to see if the candidate focuses on an individual achievement or on one that made their organization successful. It is these subtle cues that reveal the difference between a high and low maintenance employee.Whether someone is an intern or a vice president, having the right attitude is everything. Experience and education can only take you so far. When evaluating candidates, I think about the marginal impact this person will have on the organization as a whole. The best people inspire and motivate others to achieve a common goal, unselfishly looking out for the best interests of the company and the people who work there.I realize now that I also made the mistake of checking the candidate's references for reassurance. At the time, the glowing reviews helped silence that nagging sense that something wasn't right. I now know you have the right candidate when you can confidently hire them without checking references. I have a rule that if I find myself wanting to call a candidate's references to determine if I should trust that ""tap on the shoulder,"" I simply won't hire them.This post originally appeared on LinkedIn."

The terrain is rough, marked by ridges, some as high as 1,000 feet. There were few beaches, and most were ringed by cliffs or dominated by high ridges. There were few roads. Historically, amphibious operations had only been attempted against undefended positions. There was no experience within the British Army on how to conduct an amphibious attack against an actively defended shore. There were no specialized landing craft.

By the time Allied troops began to land on April 25, Ottoman preparations were complete: Extensive fortifications had been built and the defending forces had been increased six-fold.The fleet set sail in early April with a force of British and French ships under Vice-Admiral Sir John de Robeck. Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston commanded the British troops while Sir William Birdwood led the Anzac forces. British General Sir Ian Hamilton was in overall command. On April 25, the warships opened fire on Ottoman positions on the Gallipoli Peninsula. Prior to the actual assault, two diversionary landings were made; one by the French at Kum Kale on the eastern side of the Dardanelles, and one by a Royal Navy division at Bulair.  ANZAC 1st Division Approaching the Landing Beach (ANZAC Cove) GallipoliThe two main landings occurred on the morning of the 25th. British and French forces attempted to land at five points around Cape Helles, but succeeded in establishing footholds at just three. Eventually, the troops, and approximately 1,500 horses and mules, came ashore in their landing crafts. With their commanding officers offshore in the warships, however, communications were difficult and often delayed. There were no portable radios so communications was by courier. Not surprisingly, there was an overall lack of direction and momentum in the subsequent attack.To the north, the Anzac troops were supposed to land at Ari Burnu, about halfway up the peninsula. Instead, they landed a mile off target below a high ridge. Against formidable opposition, the Anzacs managed to win a bridgehead, now christened ""Anzac Cove,"" on the Aegean side of the peninsula. There the progress halted. Attempts to charge off the beach were met by fierce Turkish resistance from the ridge overlooking the Anzac positions. Allied reinforcements became pinned down on the beaches under murderous fire and could not support the attack. Royal Naval Division Attacking Turkish Positions, GallipoliOttoman forces were under the command of German General von Sanders. Once aware of the diversionary attack to the north at Bulair, he ordered Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kemal to move his forces to intercept the perceived threat. Kemal disobeyed the order and instead threw his reserves into the fight for the ridge above Anzac cove. It was then that he gave his famous order to the 57th Turkish Infantry Regiment, ""I do not order you to attack. I order you to die. In the time which passes until we die, other troops and commanders can come forward and take our places.""Bolstered by their reinforcement, the Turkish troops on the ridge dug in and the situation was stabilized. The Allied forces were unable to get off the beach and their beachhead was restricted to only a couple of hundred square yards. At Cape Helles the Allies held a small beachhead of a few square miles. Gallipoli had quickly become a repetition of the stalemate on the Western Front. The initial landings had been horrifically costly. Over 20,000 men were dead or wounded, and the balance was effectively trapped on the beaches.

24,BUSINESS,Increase Sales By Being An Example Of Service,"Matt Tenney, ContributorAuthor of THE MINDFULNESS EDGE and SERVE TO BE GREAT",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/increase-sales-by-being-a_b_7136718.html,Bridget is a project manager for a tech company called Qstream. Her role is essentially to create a strategy to implement technology that has already been purchased in a way that best meets the business needs of the client. She is not in a sales role.,2015-04-25,2015-04-24-1429889906-9014735-exampleofservice.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-24-1429889906-9014735-exampleofservice-thumb.jpg,"Bridget is a project manager for a tech company called Qstream. Her role is essentially to create a strategy to implement technology that has already been purchased in a way that best meets the business needs of the client. She is not in a sales role.However, Bridget sees her main purpose as doing whatever she can to best meet the needs of the client. In other words, she is ""customer purposed.""Because Bridget is customer purposed, she tends to go well beyond the requirements of her role. For instance, with a recent client, she spent a significant amount of time talking with people throughout organizations, working to uncover needs and thinking of ways to help.   The business results of her efforts to serve are striking. This particular account has grown from $25k to $1.5 million in two years.What could your organization achieve if it was full of people like Bridget?I recently had the pleasure of chatting with Scott Edinger. Scott is the author of a new book called, The Hidden Leader, in which he offers proven ideas for building a culture that has more people like Bridget. The core idea I took away from our conversation is that a culture full of people like Bridget starts at the top with leaders who are more like Bridget.When leaders consistently exemplify a few key traits it becomes much easier to find the hidden ""Bridgets"" within an organization because the leaders are more aware of what the key traits look like. Perhaps more important, when leaders consistently exemplify those key traits, they create an environment where the hidden ""Bridgets"" feel more comfortable behaving in ways aligned with these traits, and people who aren't naturally like Bridget are more likely to become more like her.Below are two of the key traits Scott mentioned.Being ""Customer Purposed""One key to creating a culture full of sales rock stars is to model a spirit of service. Scott calls this being ""customer purposed."" As we saw with Bridget, being customer purposed means going well beyond just doing what is required of the position. It means taking the time to really engage with a customer and understand what a customer is trying to accomplish. Often, this can even include integrating solutions that come from other people or organizations.Leaders can model this behavior in how we deal with external customers. Perhaps more important, we can model that behavior with our internal customers, the people we lead. We should understand where the people on our teams want to go - and what they want to accomplish - and work to help them get there, even if that means they eventually want to leave our team.Inviting ObjectionsOne of the most common weaknesses I see in sales people is fear of objections. They try to avoid any discussion of what my give a customer apprehension about applying the solution being offered.People who are strongest in sales tend to openly invite a discussion about possible objections as early as possible. They know inviting objections and helping a customer feel heard builds the trust that is essential for healthy, long-term relationship, while also providing more time to find ways to solve the issues that are giving rise to the objections.In my chat with Scott, he stressed the importance of leaders modeling this same type of comfort with inviting opposing viewpoints and opinions. By explicitly inviting dissenting opinions and disagreement, leaders serve team members by creating a culture in which people feel much safer to share ideas that could be invaluable to the success of the organization. This also benefits the organization by a creating culture with more people who effectively serve customers and thereby increase sales.  What are some of the ways you model the behaviors you'd like your team members to emulate when dealing with both internal and external customers?_____Matt Tenney is a social entrepreneur, an international keynote speaker, and the author of  Serve to Be Great: Leadership Lessons from a Prison, a Monastery, and a Boardroom."
