British officials say a mysterious virus related to SARS may have spread between humans, as they confirmed the 11th case worldwide of the new coronavirus in a patient who they say probably caught it from a family member. Officials at the World Health Organization said the new virus has probably already spread between humans in some instances. (AP Photo/Health Protection Agency)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd443240000500094d6ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kate KellandLONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - A fourth person in Britain has contracted a potentially fatal SARS-like virus which was unknown in humans until a few months ago, but health officials said on Friday the risk to the population remained very low.Confirming the third British case this week of infection the new virus - known as novel coronavirus, or NCoV - the Health Protection Agency said the patient was one of a cluster of three in the same family.This latest case brings the total number of confirmed cases globally to 12, of which four have been diagnosed in Britain, the HPA said. Of the total, five have died. Most of the infected lived or had recently been in the Middle East.NCoV was identified when the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued an international alert in September 2012 saying a virus previously unknown in humans had infected a Qatari man in Britain who had recently been in Saudi Arabia.The virus belongs to the same family as SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - a coronavirus that emerged in China in 2002 and killed about a tenth of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide. Symptoms common to both viruses include severe respiratory illness, fever, coughing and breathing difficulties.The HPA, which earlier this week said the other two patients from the same family were being treated in intensive care units in separate hospitals in northern and central England, said the third case in the cluster was mild.""The patient ... is recovering from a mild respiratory illness and is currently well,"" it said in a statement.John Watson, the HPA's head of respiratory diseases said that despite this, the HPA was advising the patient to self-isolate and limit contact with other people. Health officials are currently following up other household members.Coronaviruses are typically spread like other respiratory infections such as flu, travelling in airborne droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.""We would like to emphasise that the risk associated with novel coronavirus to the general UK population remains very low,"" Watson said. When a second case in this cluster was found on Wednesday, Tom Wilkinson, a senior lecturer in respiratory medicine at Britain's University of Southampton, said that if NCoV turned out to be like the previous SARS outbreak, it may prove quite slow to spread from one human to another.""But it's early days to make any definite statements because viruses can change and mutate very rapidly, so what is right today may be wrong tomorrow,"" he said.Among the 12 laboratory-confirmed cases of NCoV to date, five are in Saudi Arabia, with three deaths; two are in Jordan, where both patients died; four are in Britain, where three are receiving treatment and the latest one is described as well; and one was in Germany in a patient from Qatar who has since been discharged from medical care.

The merger of US Airways and American Airlines has given birth to a mega airline with more passengers than any other in the world. (AP Photo/The Arizona Republic,Tom Tinkle, File) MARICOPA COUNTY OUT; MAGS OUT;",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd2e82500003300363942.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As American Airlines and US Airways announce plans to merge -- a deal that would create the world's largest airline -- passengers are naturally wondering how they'll be affected.Waves of recent consolidation in the industry have given airline-watchers some basis for prognostication. And, if history is a guide, the newly emboldened American Airlines may get bigger without getting better.Here's a look at just a few questions that the merger raises.When will the merger actually happen?Good question. While the union is being announced on Valentine's Day, it will likely take time for the love between the airlines to blossom. ""The integration of the two airlines, with all of the labor, technological and logistical issues to sort out, will undoubtedly take years,"" writes Dennis Schaal on the travel site Skift. ""The stakes are extremely high, as United-Continentalâ€™s bumpy track record in their merger highlights,"" he continues. A statement from AA says ""The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013.""What will the new airline be called?""The combined airline will retain the iconic American Airlines brand,"" according to the carriers, ""and will be headquartered in Dallas-Fort Worth, with a significant corporate and operational presence in Phoenix.""Just how big will the airline be?The new airline will have ""more than 6,700 daily flights to 336 destinations in 56 countries,"" the airlines promise, projecting 2013 revenues of $40 billion, serving more than 187 million customers. It's a particularly big win for US Airways, which AP writer Scott Mayerowitz writes ""has often been ridiculed within the aviation industry and remains a perennial afterthought among travelers."" The AA-US merger, Mayerowitz continues, ""will elevate both airlines to the same level as Delta and United. International business travelers will be left with just three mega-airlines to pick from and the merger will likely bring to a close more than 30 years of U.S. airline consolidation.""What happens to AA and US Air frequent flier miles?That's TBD, at least one mileage expert says. Points professional Brian Kelly told New York Times columnist Joe Sharkey that the programs would likely combine, a move that might give some fliers with a few miles in each program the chance to cash in their markers for a free ticket. The downside is that those tickets may be harder to come by, Kelly says: ""After they sit down and work out all of their synergies, the bottom line will be that international capacity and award availability will be cut.""Will fares go up?It's too early to tell. ""Domestic airfare in 2013 is already projected to be approximately 5% higher than in 2012,"" says Travelzoo's senior editor Gabe Saglie. ""Reduced competition between legacy carriers could mean higher fares across the board."" Other industry watchers concur. ""All-in prices (airfares plus extra fees) will go up,"" writes Charles Leocha in USA Today. ""Services will be reduced -- all for a merger that is unnecessary for the long-term survival of either airline."" Other airfare experts are less worried about the potential for higher fares. As George Hobica of Airfarewatchdog writes on HuffPost Travel, ""Fares won't increase all that much, if at all. If airlines have learned one thing, it's that people stay home, drive or video-conference if fares go too high. Most air travel is discretionary, not 'must do.'""Will the airlines lay off staff?That's unclear. Combined, the airlines employ about 1.2 million people, and the carriers say in a statement that ""Employees of the combined airline will benefit from being part of a company with a more competitive and stable financial foundation, which will create greater opportunities over the long term."" But the same statement from the airlines later promises that ""estimated cost synergies of approximately $150 million are net of the impact of the new labor combined contracts at American Airlines and US Airways."" Many of the various labor unions involved have already signed off on the idea of a merger.What happens if passengers already have tickets for scheduled flights?Headaches will likely abound, ""Especially in the short term,"" says Travelzoo's Saglie. ""Things like long wait times on reservations lines, computer glitches and scheduling snafus can be par for the course when airlines merge,"" he says. When United merged with Continental, the airlines staged multiple dress rehearsals to make sure their computer systems would work together before making the change. Those steps were taken after US Airways had computer problems during a merger with America West, a process that began in 2005.The flip side, writes Tracy Stewart at Airfarewatchdog, is a (possibly) more robust travel experience. ""You won't be getting steak Diane in the cheap seats any time soon, but how about a full can of Coke and a bag of pretzels?"" he says. ""Who knows, but minor service improvements along with a little more stability wouldn't hurt. A larger airline is also able to reroute passengers over a larger network when there's a cancellation or delay.""""At this time,"" the companies say in a statement, ""The airlines will operate as two separate carriers flying schedules as they do today. Customers will not see any changes to their existing travel reservations, and can and should continue to book, track and manage flight and travel plans on AA.com.""Didn't American Airlines just unveil a new logo? What was that about?Insider gossip says that the logo and livery redesign were part of a bigger merger-focused play by American. Whatever the reason for the timing -- and the mixed reviews -- the new look will live on post merger as the US Air livery heads into the history books."
3,DIVORCE,7 Signs You're Not Ready To Date,"Elizabeth Denham, Contributor

How does it happen? These are the inevitable questions that start to percolate after a divorce.,2013-02-14,guy is bored on a date with a girl in a summer cafe,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ccaed25000032003635b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When do I start dating? Am I ready? How does it happen? These are the inevitable questions that start to percolate after a divorce. And they should be answered with some real thought and consideration. I believe that self-awareness is a big key to life, and for those newly dating, it is of the utmost importance. You must know who you are and where you are in your post-divorce evolution. After the emotional pit of a divorce, some people want nothing to do with the opposite sex -- they're not ready. Many try to tip-toe into the dating pool -- they're getting there -- and some cannon-ball in with no fear, often looking for too much too fast.In my saga of post-divorce dating, I have learned to recognize -- in myself and others -- the signs that you are not ready to date. If you are exhibiting any of the following, you may want to stick with girls/guys nights out for a little bit longer:1. If you are still married, you are not ready to date.  Your relationship may be over, you may feel ready for companionship, you may be enduring the divorce proceedings that seem like they will never end, but you are not ready to date. Legally, like it or not, you are committed to someone else. And being married, no matter the circumstance, precludes you from being able to fully commit to even just one date. I know people who have, for some reason, just not gotten a divorce and lived like they were single. This is a big red flag because if it's over, end it. Not ending it tells me that there is a reason you are not ending it. If you are in the midst of divorce hell, that is not attractive to anyone and it's not fair to expect someone else to shoulder that burden with you. Wait until you are really free.2. If you still feel married, you are not ready to date. This seems obvious, but I went on a date with a man who kept saying, ""My wife, I mean ex-wife."" He further proceeded to tell me that by sitting there with me having coffee, he felt like he was cheating on his wife. If you have not yet made the clean emotional break from your ex, take a little more time to heal.3. If you have not been divorced for at least a year, you are not ready to date. I know, many are convinced they are ready sooner, but I tried dating a few recently divorced men to see if I was wrong. I wasn't. No one just divorced has regained the requisite self-awareness to know that they are not yet ready to date.4. If you have written an online profile in which you list all of the things that you don't want in a date, you are not ready to date. When you say things like, I don't want liars, cheaters, manipulators, addicts, etc., you are telegraphing the things that happened to you in your last relationship. This tells potential dates that you are not over it. It comes off as angry and bitter, and you don't want your date to think you are either of those.5. If you are not past gross generalizations, you are not ready to date. If you are in a phase and think ""all men/women are liars,"" stick to movie nights at home. Until you are able to realize that what happened in your marriage was a unique event in your life, chances are you will project generalizations on your date -- who is likely completely innocent of that behavior. How fair is that?6. If you cannot have a conversation on a first date without mentioning your ex more than once, you are not ready to date. The first date or two or three is not the time to talk about your ex. The focus should be on getting to know your date and allowing them to get to know you. You are not defined by your divorce. Only when you know that is it time to date!7. If you are still angry over your divorce, you are not ready to date. To me, anger is the single most destructive emotion to a relationship -- dating, married or otherwise. Anger over specific events is one thing. Generalized anger either at your ex or at men/women in general is an indication that you need more time to heal. Anger tends to be taken out on those with whom you spend time. Don't let it be a date.Everyone takes a different path to healing. I have friends who jumped into dating as quickly as they could, and others who can't imagine dating several years post-divorce. The key is to know where you are on the path and to recognize your readiness. There is a time when you first start to date in which you are ready to go on dates, but not ready to be in a relationship. That is fine, as long as you are honest with yourself and your date. If you are self-aware, you will not lead yourself or your date on. And when you are ready for more, you will know it."
