(AP Photo/Thomas Kienzle)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9def7a240000510053c815.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As of Tuesday, the number of confirmed cases of measles in New York City has risen to 20 incidents, nine of which involve children. The city's health department announced the new total amid an investigation into whether the highly contagious disease was spread in several medical facilities after workers failed to properly identify and treat symptoms quickly. The New York Times reports only three of the 11 infected adults had records proving they were vaccinated. Seven of the nine children were too young to be vaccinated. Following the wishes of their parents, the other two children had not been vaccinated.Officials would not say where the latest case was identified, but a majority of them have been concentrated in northern Manhattan. Since the first known outbreak of the disease in early February, 16 Manhattan residents, three Bronx residents, and one Brooklyn resident have been infected.“We know a number of people were exposed and possibly got their infection either at a doctor’s office or at an emergency room where they went and it took more time than it should have for them to be put in an isolation area where they couldn’t possibly infect anyone else,” the city's deputy commissioner of disease control Dr. Jay Varma told The Times. The United States was thought to have eradicated measles in 2000, but the number of reported outbreaks has grown in recent years, alarming officials as vaccination rates have also fallen. In 2013, measles incidents tripled with 58 out of 175 cases identified in Brooklyn alone after parents in two Jewish communities refused to vaccinate their children in misguided fear that immunization will lead to autism."

The reality star sat down with Bravo's Andy Cohen for an episode of ""Watch What Happens Live"" on Tuesday, March 18, and the host pressed her on her recent anti-vaccine comments. ""You know, at the end of the day, I'm just a mom,"" Cavallari told Cohen of her personal decision not to vaccinate her kids. ""There are very scary statistics out there regarding what is in vaccines and what they cause -- asthma, allergies, ear infections, all kinds of things. We feel like we are making the best decision for our kids."" Cavallari, who is pregnant with her second child with husband Jay Cutler, previously made headlines for an interview she gave to Fox Business show ""The Independents,"" during which she discussed anti-vaccine advocate Jenny McCarthy. The ""Laguna Beach"" alum said she hasn't vaccinated her 19-month-old son, Camden, and will not vaccinate her new baby after he's born because she has ""read too many books about autism."" ""There is a pediatric group called Homestead, or Home First? Pregnancy brain, I've got it confused,"" she said. ""They've never vaccinated any of their children and they haven't had one case of autism. And now, one in 88 boys is autistic, which is a really scary statistic. ... The vaccinations have changed over the years, there's more mercury.""The 27-year-old then spoke with HuffPost Live, saying she was ""bombarded"" and ""thrown off-guard"" during the Fox interview. She added that she does not want to be part of the vaccination debate. Still, she thinks there is a reason behind the increased prevalence of autism, whether it be vaccines or the food we eat. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one in 88 children have autism spectrum disorders. Some believe that this number, which is higher than estimates from the early 1990s, is related to thimerosal, a preservative ingredient in vaccines. However, in 2001, thimerosal was removed or reduced to trace amounts in all childhood vaccines except for an influenza vaccine. There is also a thimerosal-free alternative available. The CDC supports findings from an Institute of Medicine scientific review, which concludes that ""evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal–containing vaccines and autism."""

But if you're good to them, they'll be extra nice to you. So here's how to charm them.",2014-03-19,Rear view of flight attendant indicating exits to passengers in airplane,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9def82250000350036a69b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Maybe you don't want to please your cabin crew next time you fly. I know, I know, it's their job to be nice; you're the customer, they're the employee. But if you're good to them, they'll be extra nice to you. So here's how to charm them.1. Say hello! If a flight attendant greets you upon boarding at the jetway, say hi back. Don't just ignore them. A simple ""good morning"" or ""good evening"" does it. How would you like to greet 20 people in a row and be greeted by silence? Well, that's what usually happens.2. Listen to the safety demo. It's just polite. Put down your iPad and Kindle. When was the last time you really listened? If it was more than a few years ago, it's time for a refresher. At the very least don't talk loudly to your neighbor when a flight attendant is standing in front of you trying to keep you safe.Related: Things they don't tell you in the safety demo3. Headphones off! Take your headphones off when they ask you what you'd like to drink so they don't have to repeat it three times. How would you like it if they were wearing headphones when talking to you? It's the Golden Rule.4. Be specific when ordering. When you ask for coffee or tea, specify milk or no milk, sweetener or not, without being asked as in, ""I'd like coffee with milk, please"" or ""I'd like coffee, black."" Not only does it make their job easier, but everyone on the plane will get served more quickly.5. Same for cold drinks. ""I'd like Diet Coke, no ice, please"" or ""Water, with ice and a slice of lemon, please.""6. Say please and thank you. As in the examples above, say please and thank you when asking for and receiving something. Again, common courtesy that will get you treated extra well. A flight attendant once told me ""We thought you were company"" (meaning that I worked for the airline) because I was so polite.7. Magazines! Donate copies of your current magazines to the crew. After you finish reading this week's US Weekly or GQ, give it to your flight attendant. Flight attendants love to read magazines when they're off duty or on break.8. Treats. It's perfectly permissible to bring a little tasty treat for your crew. Just make sure it's safety-sealed -- not your homemade muffins, which might be considered a safety hazard. I bring boxes of Walker's Scottish shortbread or factory-sealed chocolates. They're always a big hit and you may be rewarded with a free cocktail or maybe even get reseated in the exit row. It happens!9. Pens! People are always asking flight attendants for pens, whether to complete immigration and customs forms or to simply do the crossword puzzle. Bring a few extra cheap pens, bundle them up and give them to your crewmember. It may not be as enjoyable as a box of chocolates, but they will surely put them to good use.10. Wheels in! Try to put your carryon bag with wheels or handles facing in before commandeering twice as much space putting it horizontally. And, for Heaven's sake, don't put your jackets or tiny bags in the bin. That takes up space for larger items that have to go there, and these smaller items easily can fit atop existing bags once everyone has boarded or underneath the seat. Flight attendants will tell you that boarding is the most stressful part of their job, and by exhibiting an ounce of courtesy and common sense, it helps the entire plane get on the way more quickly.11. Stay out of the aisles. Make your best effort to stay out of the aisles when the carts are brought out or when the plane is boarding. Try to use the bathroom before boarding or after takeoff, but if the crew begins their service, it is best to stay seated. The carts are heavy and awkward to maneuver, and there's no reason to become an obstacle to them unless absolutely necessary. And if a crewmember reminds you that the seatbelt sign is still illuminated, remember that they are just doing their job.12. Stay out of the galley! Sure you need to stretch your legs and all, but galleys are tiny and your flight attendant doesn't want you there.13. Tell the airline. If a flight attendant offers exceptionally nice service, most airlines have a mechanism for recognizing them. Ask for their employee number and note the flight number.Where will all this kindness get you? No, you probably won't get an inflight upgrade (although flight attendants do have the ability to offer them if there's room). Maybe the crew will forget to charge you for your cocktail. Maybe they'll reseat you if the child behind you is wailing like a banshee. I've been offered a bottle of wine at the end of the flight on more than one occasion. But sometimes being nice is its own reward. Further reading: What your flight attendant would tell you (if only she could)"
3,WELLNESS,San Francisco Is The Latest City To Restrict E-Cigarettes Under Anti-Smoking Laws,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/e-cigarettes-ban-san-francisco_us_5b9defb6e4b03a1dcc8f16c8,"Unusually late to the bandwagon, San Francisco’s e-cigarette regulations will trail restrictions already passed in Los Angeles",2014-03-19,"MIAMI, FL - FEBRUARY 20: Julia Boyle enjoys an electronic cigarette at the Vapor Shark store on February 20, 2014 in Miami, Florida. As the popularity of E- cigarettes continue to grow, leading U.S. tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc. the maker of Marlboro cigarettes are annoucing plans to launch their own e-cigarettes as they start to pose a small but growing competitive threat to traditional smokes. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9defb6250000330036a6b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Electronic cigarettes are set to be as restricted in San Francisco as all other tobacco products after the city’s Board of Supervisors unanimously approved regulations aimed at protecting children from picking up a nicotine habit. Introduced by Supervisor Eric Mar, the legislation places e-cigarettes under the city’s rigid anti-smoking laws already in place.“The ordinance would allow smoking e-cigarettes in the same places that cigarettes are allowed; prohibit them where cigarettes are prohibited; prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes on City and County property and other places cigarettes can't be sold; and require a tobacco permit for the sale or furnishing of e-cigarettes,” Mar wrote in his district’s newspaper, The Richmond Review.Unusually late to the bandwagon, San Francisco’s e-cigarette regulations will trail restrictions already passed in Los Angeles, New York City, Washington D.C., Chicago, Boston and five states.After voting for the ordinance Tuesday, the supervisors will vote on it a second time next week, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, and then require a signature from Mayor Ed Lee, who supports the initiative. If successful, the ordinance will become law in April.Mar expressed concern that e-cigarettes’ unregulated presence encourages children to purchase the product, noting that they’re sold alongside “Mentos and candy bars” in stores and come in kid-friendly flavors, according to CBS San Francisco.“I have a banana-flavored one and a peach-flavored one,” Mar said while demonstrating the product at his legislation presentation, the Chronicle reports. “They are really targeted at young people and right now it's not regulated.”While studies have found that e-cigarette use doubled among teens between 2011 and 2012, research is inconclusive as to whether such use leads to smoking traditional cigarettes, and advocates for the electronic alternative fear such regulations will hurt those who use the product to quit smoking. E-cigarettes are considered safer than regular ones, although they still contain dangerous chemicals, metals and gases, Stan Glantz of the University of California, San Francisco’s Center for Tobacco Control Research told the Chronicle.Mar did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post’s requests for comment on whether the ordinance will impact those using the product to transition to a smoke-free life.

The dialogue I have aloud with myself goes something as follows:""What does it mean when you have a fever?"" ""It means that there are toxic cells in your body that cannot live above 98.6 degrees and your body is trying to burn them off."" ""What do we do?"" ""Take Tylenol to lower the fever."" ""What does this do?"" ""Helps keep the toxins alive in our bodies longer."" ""What does it mean when you have diarrhea?"" ""It means that there are toxins in your colon that your body is trying to get out."" ""What do we do?"" ""Take Imodium."" ""What does this do?"" ""Shuts down our elimination system so that the toxins stay in our bodies longer.""""What does it mean when you have a runny nose?"" ""It means that there are toxins in your head which is producing mucus to get them out."" ""What do we do?' ""Take antihistamines."" ""What does this do?"" ""Dries up our noses and keeps the toxins in our bodies longer.""Western medicine is awesome for treating symptoms such as fevers, diarrhea, and runny noses; it is also wonderful for breaking down our bodies into separate components and treating them individually. But have you ever imagined that this might be missing the forest for the trees? For the human body can also be seen as an integral system, a holistic organism. Western medicine is nonpareil regarding organ transplants, bone marrow transplants, and analyzing body parts such as brains down to their minutest details. But this is still only one way of envisioning the human body and its scope and depth are constantly being updated and revised. However, omniscience remains elusive. For instance, Western science cannot explain how the moon influences the tides or how acupuncture needles in ears or feet move energy through an invisible meridian system and rebalance ""chi"" in the liver or kidneys. Did you know that until around 150 years ago surgery was performed in barber shops and the anesthesia was whiskey? Personally I believe that in 150 years people will look back on some of our contemporary procedures such as root canals the way we look back on leeching - namely, as barbaric. Parallel to physical health, if you analyze the bible of mental health - the DSM - you will quickly find that the barometer for mental wellness in our society is ""Can you show up for work, be a productive member of society, and earn a living?"" Or more specifically, ""Can you do your 'job?'"" And if you cannot, then the pharmaceutical corporations have remedies for whatever ails you from working, whether it is insomnia, an inability to concentrate, a broken heart, sundry afflictions, worries, erratic moods, obsessive behavior, or bereavement. But did you know that according to the New York Times over 50% of the psychiatrists who wrote the DSM received money at some time from pharmaceutical corporations? Are you beginning to see a possible conflict of interest in our definition(s) of mental illness?Similarly, regarding physical well-being, we dislike fevers, diarrhea, and runny noses because they impede us from working or doing things. But could these symptoms not also be interpreted holistically to mean, ""Hey, slow down, you're not taking care of yourself, you're not eating correctly, you're not sleeping enough, you're so stressed out that your immune system is on overload... are you really sure you were put on earth to work 80 hours per week???."" This is what Mindful Medicine is: looking at the big picture, regarding the body as a holistic mechanism and interpreting symptoms on a grander scale. That doesn't mean that we should not treat our ailments; it just means that having expanded perspectives on how our entire organisms are functioning might keep us healthy longer. Tylenol, Imodium, and antihistamines are highly effective pharmaceuticals, but just like Band-Aids they don't solve the underlying problems; they just cover them up."

You can indeed be more tired than you ever thought possible.,2014-03-18,Their Baby Cuteness Doesn't Predict Adult Attractiveness ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b03bb26000036007ef76b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"There's no bigger change in a woman's life than becoming a mother for the first time. With my first child, it seemed like every day brought a hundred new surprises.But when I became pregnant for the second time, I thought I got this! And in some ways, that was true. I didn't stress nearly as much about every little thing. But I quickly learned that boy number two was his own person -- and that I still had a lot to learn.Here are 20 things I learned from the second baby.1. Just because your pregnancy went a certain way with the first child doesn't mean it will go anything like that with the next one.2. A baby doesn't have to be carried all that carefully. In fact, he'll adjust quite easily to being carried like a football.3. You'll worry to death about the first one no longer being an ""only child"" while you're pregnant. He'll be just fine.4. Even a relatively young baby will find a way to fight with his older sibling.5. Five stained onesies can make up a baby's entire wardrobe.6. You can survive bed rest even though you'll be convinced you'll never make it. You might be surly, but you can do it.7. Your body doesn't bounce back quite as well with the second one (if it ever did in the first place).8. You can indeed be more tired than you ever thought possible.9. A baby doesn't really need shoes.10. You can do the same things you did with the first one and the second one will still turn out totally different.11. You no longer think having one kid is hard.12. No, you will not have any ""me"" time. Even in a two-parent household, no one is ""off"" anymore -- you're now in man-to-man coverage.13. You're not a yeller, you say? Well, if you ever want to be heard above the kids, you are now.14. I do not indeed have an unlistenable singing voice.15. Some kids do not like TV. At all.16. Sometimes the closest thing to a break you'll get will be lying on the floor while two children straddle you and yell ""Yeehaw!""17. Childproofing is not childproof.18. A small child can scale a piece of furniture before you have time to wipe your nose.19. If the older child laughs at him, he'll do absolutely anything over and over and over and over. The older child doesn't laugh at good behavior.20. There is enough room in your heart to love another child just as much as you loved the first one.Also on HuffPost:"
