1,BLACK VOICES,It's Absurd to Associate Django Unchained With Black Culture,"Leonce Gaiter, Contributor

(AP Photo/The Weinstein Company, Andrew Cooper, SMPSP, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badd0a6260000cf00810ab3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Quentin Tarantino's film, Django Unchained has as much to do with the history and culture of American descendants of African slaves as Dumbo has to do with the plight of Weimar Jewry. Spike Lee says that it disrespects his ancestors. It does not. It has nothing to do with them. It has everything to do with one white man's fevered, second-hand vision of what it would be like to be something he probably can't conceive. It's like me attempting to write an intimate account of the pains of childbirth. I may have held a baby and changed a diaper, but one would doubt my authority on the subject. Tarantino obviously knows black people, but only a white man in America could believe that this provides him with the authority to speak on the black American experience. Like 99.9999 percent of the white population, he has minimal intimacy with the culture of the descendants of American slaves. That culture, imbibed from birth by American blacks raised in black American households, involves an intimate, often subconscious acknowledgment of history, of a unique place in the American hierarchy, of a struggle against mainstream paradigms of who and what we are. These are intimacies of which whites are necessarily ignorant -- they're white. Just as I, as a male, have no intimate knowledge of birthing pains, whites have no knowledge of being black. They can gain an abstract conception, but that's it.   Of course, Tarantino has every right to make a film on any subject he chooses, and he knows his audience well. The film has become the white literati's preferred lens into the forbidden territory of black rage (a sort of reverse Uncle Tom's Cabin). But when blacks discuss it as if this product of white Hollywood is a legitimate expression of our culture or our rage, we do ourselves a gross injustice; we follow the pattern of outsourcing our history and self-image to the majority; we marry ourselves into the grotesque self-images that their history has tried to stamp upon us. Django Unchained is nothing more than one white Hollywood director's fantasy of what black revenge would look like. It would be no more to us than another big screen cartoon if we dealt honestly and independently with our own history -- a history white studios or directors would never touch. Such history puts the lie to the frames and simplifications with which Americans maintain our halo of historical innocence on matters related to race. If we lavished similar imagination upon the history of the blacks who fought for the British during the American revolution to escape slavery, the German Coast uprising, the Prosser and Vesey rebellions, the 'Crazy as St. Paul' Nat Turner rebellion, the Black Seminole rebellion of 1835, the innumerable anecdotal tales of black resistance against slave-owners, perhaps we wouldn't glom onto the work of a white director who (with his infantile insistence on his right to fling the word ""nigger"") seems frightfully similar to the clueless character in Lou Reed's infamous, ""I Wanna be Black."" If we taught ourselves to regard the Civil War as ""a failed war to protect and extend slavery,"" and not ""a war to free the slaves,"" we would be less seduced by the siren song of second-hand revenge fantasy. If we debated among ourselves the virtues and vices of real old-west outlaws like the notorious Rufus Buck Gang, Cherokee Bill and Isom Dart, perhaps one white man's notion of blacks in the old west would be less noteworthy. If we knew that black freedman populated Indian Territory and that a black lawman named Bass Reeves served as a Deputy U.S. Marshall for ""Hanging Judge"" Isaac Parker, we'd have a far richer, more complex view of our history than that promoted by the likes of Hollywood and Tarantino.Yes, blacks are giving this film too much credence, but it's our own fault. We have outsourced our history to the majority and failed to devise the means to teach our history to ourselves. In a country in which we have been historically subjugated and reviled, we accept instruction about our history and our place in it from those who subjugated and reviled us. That's a bit insane. As long as we continue to do so, the likes of Django Unchained will rise from the level of mainstream curiosities from black-cultural dilettantes, to fake nipples mimicking the teat of cultural sustenance."

Among these are total unit sales in a year, market share versus direct competitors, and sales improvement year-over-year. The best measure is none of these. Rather, it is the availability of a particular model on any given day, week or month. The auto manufacturing industry calls this measure “days to turn” or “time on lot.” The average car or light truck takes 50 or 60 days to sell once a dealer gets it. Some models can stay on lots for more than 90 days. The vehicles that are in really great demand are on lots for fewer than 20 days, and sometimes closer to 10.An analysis of cars that sit on dealer lots for the least time finds that they fall into three groups. The first consists of extremely expensive cars, with sticker prices above $50,000 or even $100,000. The next group is inexpensive sports cars. The third is cars that get very high mileage, including hybrids. Most of the cars and light trucks that have tight inventory have been on the market for several years. The Ford Escape and Subaru Impreza are examples of economy-priced cars that have sold well for five years or more.The price range of vehicles that are in tight supply is surprisingly wide, and the range of car types is equally broad. The list includes cars that cost less than $25,000 and two that cost more than $100,000, as well as heavy SUVs and light economy cars with small engines.Based on November 2012 days-to-turn data for vehicles sold in the United States, provided by Edmunds.com, 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 models that spend the shortest time on the lot. Edmunds also provided annual sales for these models dating back to 2007, as well as the first 11 months of sales for 2012. We also identified base MSRP of these models, as well as additional features from manufacturer websites.Here Are The Cars So Hot They're Out Of Stock: "

He said that for a ""moderate-sized"" 1,500 acre spread, you'll need a butler, cook, secretary, groundspeople and cleaning staff.

Everyday repairs on your estate or castle will set you back another $100,000 a year or so.Renovations are the big ticket item. Sweeting said most owners do a major renovation after they've purchase their estates. After about 20 or 30 years, they either redo them again or sell. (Read More: The Five Largest Landowners in America)He said many clients spend $6 million to $8 million on renovations, though some spend much more.In the end, the total bill for keeping an estate is upwards of $1.5 million or more.Sweeting said some buyers don't realize the full costs of owning a country estate until a year or two into ownership. Knight Frank, he said, spends a lot of time educating them on the costs and time before sales.""It can be a bit of a shock,"" he said. ""We try to educate them on all the costs involved.""He said owners can offset some of the costs with tax benefits, which help farm owners. But he said the high costs of owning an estate means that the largest of the country homes now selling in Britain are often selling to super-rich buyers from Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the U.S. or Latin America.

I have a scientific curiosity about how these banks work. The only way I can think of to truly understand the banks is to dissect one of them. I want to capture a bank (preferably Bank of America), and I want to dip it in formaldehyde to preserve as much of it as possible. I want to pin the bank to a wax setting, slice it open, and explore what makes it tick. I want the entire world to learn how the banks rose to power.Why do we let the banks control us? Consider this: Money doesn't exist in nature. Currency is an imaginary number, and Economics is a complicated math based entirely on these imaginary numbers. This is why the fiscal cliff is so ridiculous to the majority of the population. It's an imaginary cliff in a small complicated corner of this global economy we all imagined. Wall Street is essentially Imaginationland. Money and power are man-made constructs in which we collectively agree on the value. We assign power to money. We allow ourselves be enslaved by the imaginations of banksters in suits who can only imagine more profits. Why do we do this to ourselves?I constantly hear in the news that the banks are too big to fail. Punishing them could destroy the economy. I don't recall the telecommunications or energy industries shutting down and creating Armageddon when Worldcom and Enron collapsed. We can't ever know if a bank is truly too big to fail unless we topple it. The Roman Empire was too big to fail once. So was the Mongolian Empire. The collapse of these power structures didn't end the human race. How will we ever know if we don't try?The question is how do we pin Bank of America to the tray?My solution has been to spend the last two years training regulators and attorneys on every back-end system I utilized during my career with the bank. Rather than blowing the whistle on the specific bad deed I leaked to the media, I focused on ensuring regulators, forensic accountants, and other qualified individuals have a map of the bank's insides. I wanted them to see as much of my view as possible. Because of this, they have the ability to prove not only my claims, but the claims of the millions of American homeowners who suffered from the bank's misdealings. It doesn't stop there though.Once we, the American people, convince our government to apply real pressure to a ""too big to fail"" bank, the employees will be threatened with losing their job. They'll know it's because the company was doing something illegal, and many of them will cover their asses. Faced with an uncertain future, these employees are likely to come to the press with their stories and preserve documentation of the bad business dealings they encountered. Some people may lose their jobs, but someone has to handle the bank's assets, so the many smaller regional banks that take on this extra work will need to hire more employees. It'll be scary for these employees, but no scarier than what these employees did to everyone who lost their home or went broke. These banks call themselves ""too big to fail,"" but I see them as ""too old to succeed."" By sacrificing one bank, we can arm ourselves with the knowledge we need to ensure our legacy on the future.

""The FTC has deflated the power of the injunction and also the incentives to not pay that have existed.""In its case against Google, the FTC claimed that Google and its subsidiary Motorola Mobility Inc had breached commitments to standard-setting bodies to license its patents on terms that are fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory. As part of the deal, Google agreed to drop claims for injunctive relief against competitors in certain patent disputes around the world. It also agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of a court or arbitrator when disputes over payment rates arise.Throughout the FTC's investigation, Google was represented by Susan Creighton of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and John Harkrider of Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider. The FTC retained Beth Wilkinson of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.'TEMPLATE'The FTC said Thursday that the threat of injunction by a holder of an essential patent hurts competition. The agreement with Google could be used as a ""template"" for other patent disputes, it said.Unlike a court decision, the FTC's agreement with Google is not binding on other companies. But it could give leverage to defendants in disputes with essential patent holders that could be used in court.""We know in today's world, defendants are getting more aggressive,"" said Matthew Woods, an antitrust and patent attorney at Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi. ""Defendants will seize on this and tell courts that injunctions are something the court should not even countenance.""But the agreement with Google may not be all good news for patent users, according to Jay Jurata, an antitrust partner at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, who said that it could have unintended consequences.The elaborate agreement allows Google to seek injunctions against companies that are unwilling to pay for a license on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. But the question of when a company is considered an unwilling licensee is one that the FTC may have unwittingly allowed holders of essential patents to manipulate, said Jurata.""They provided a road map for other standard essential patent holders to engage in opportunistic behavior to paint otherwise willing licensees as unwilling licensees,"" he said.Woods of Robins Kaplan also cautioned that the FTC's deal with Google may be unique because of the company's giant size and dominance, which can attract the attention of regulators.""There are a lot litigants who aren't going to see this agreement as restraining them, because they don't have the same portfolio as Google,"" Woods said.

Both players have a tremendous ability to read the opponent's alignments before the snap, and do a great job of changing the play before the snap to put their respective units into favorable alignments and plays. Whichever of the two can fool the other most often will give their unit a major advantage. In terms of physical factors, Lewis' return will have a much smaller impact than it will on the chess match aspect of the game. Lewis reads plays correctly, and as a results is frequently in position to ""clean up"" run plays, tackling a ball-carrier who the rest of the front seven has forced into running in Lewis' direction. On the other side, he lacks the quickness to disrupt run plays by exploding past blockers.Lost in the excitement of Luck's passing prowess is the fact that he is also a very efficient runner. He's picked up a first down 37 percent of the times he has run with the football, and has scored five rushing touchdowns on the season. If Luck escapes the pocket to the outside of the field, the Ravens immediately face a huge mismatch.Colts receiver T.Y. Hilton has emerged as a deep target for the Colts, and can burn the Ravens for a long touchdown if the defense prematurely vacates its assignments and tries to stop Luck from running with the ball. If the Ravens stay disciplined in pass coverage when Luck gets outside of the pocket, though, they're giving a good bit of running room to a quarterback who's averaging 4.1 yards per carry. Likewise, if Luck is given space to run up the middle and no receivers are open, he can take off elude the 38-year-old Lewis without difficulty. To prevent Luck from hurting the defense with his legs, the Ravens will need to clog the middle of the line of scrimmage when pass-rushing, and rely on their outside linebackers to keep Luck from running outside of the pocket.If the Ravens can force Luck to stay in the pocket, he's going to have to be patient and methodical while the pass rush is coming down in his face. Tight end Dwayne Allen's precise route-running and quick cuts allow him to find openings between linebackers in pass coverage. As pass coverage is a weakness for the Ravens, especially Lewis, Allen's ability to find creases in the defense is going to be vital to the Colts' hopes of keeping the offense moving smoothly. Reggie Wayne has lost a lot of effectiveness as a deep threat, with his longest reception of the year being only 33 yards, but his ability to get into cushions in the defense will be another weapon in the short passing game. When looking for big plays through the air, the Colts are going to have to lean heavily on Luck hitting Hilton in the seams of coverage when the Ravens play zone. Luck can't be afraid to pull the trigger and hit Hilton deep in the middle of the field, or the Ravens will be able to play closer to the line and have more success disrupting the run game and short passing game. If Luck tries to force the ball to Hilton in that area, though, safety Ed Reed will be waiting in the middle of the field to make Luck pay for his mistake.Ravens' offense vs. Colts' defenseThe Ravens don't have the best quarterback or receiving corps, but the offense is constructed in a manner where the units' strengths complement each other, making the Ravens' offense much greater than the sum of its parts.Quarterback Joe Flacco doesn't go through progressions well, usually either firing the ball deep or immediately checking down to running back Ray Rice if the deep option isn't open. When he does throw mid-range passes, Flacco's accuracy is frequently off-target. Veteran receiver Anquan Boldin isn't a speedy deep threat, but he's great at adjusting to the ball in the air, which helps compensate for Flacco's lack of accuracy on passes with a medium distance. On the deep ball, receiver Torrey Smith consistently gets good positioning underneath deep passes so he can make a play, and receiver Jacoby Jones is a threat to take the top off the defense on the opposite side of the field from Smith. Further complicating the Colts' task of stopping the Ravens' passing game is running back Ray Rice and the Ravens' powerful offensive line. The Colts' defensive line gets blown off the ball often in the run game, so the linebackers will be more involved providing run support than defending against the pass.As a result, the most important player in this matchup will be Colts cornerback Vontae Davis. Davis has great speed and can get to overthrows that would otherwise just be incompletions, as he did on an interception of Matt Schuab in the endzone when covering Andre Johnson last week. If Davis can stay with Smith and Jones down the field when covering them, he'll have a shot to fight for the ball and make the rest of the Colts' defenders' jobs easier."

From a schematic standpoint, the basis of the Redskins' offense is extremely simple: a read-option that either involves handing the ball off the running back Alfred Morris, or rolling Robert Griffin to the right and having him throw the ball to the flat, or deep downfield. They throw in the occasional option pitch and other wrinkles, but the fundamental key to stopping the Redskins' passing attack is shutting down Griffin's bootlegs. When Griffin's chased out of the pocket, the defense has to shift its priority to making sure he doesn't take off with the ball. This leads to numerous defenders being out of place in coverage, which creates a lot of opportunities for dumpoff passes to turn into highlight-reel plays due to receivers having running room after the catch.The Seahawks, though, have no shortage of athleticism at the defensive end position, and the team's defense has fared well against both Carolina's Cam Newton and San Francisco's Colin Kaepernick, two other quarterbacks whose offenses heavily utilize read-option elements. The Seahawks' defense held the 49ers to 13 points, the San Francisco's lowest score since Kaepernick took over as the team's starting quarterback in Week 10. The Seahawks held the Panthers to 12 points, only three of which were scored by Carolina's offense. With the speed to limit if not stop the Redskins' options and bootlegs, the Seahawks' defensive personnel match up well against the Redskins' pocket passing game. 21 percent of Griffin's passes are thrown behind the line of scrimmage, with a large number of those passes being designed screens. The size of the Seahawks' large cornerbacks Brandon Bowner and Richard Sherman, (who are as tall or taller than all of the Redskins' receivers), coupled with the defensive line's ability to shoot gaps and get behind the line of scrimmage, make screen plays a disadvantageous matchup for the Redskins. The rest of the Redskins' dropback passing game is based largely on slants and other quick, short passes. The Seahawks' defensive backs, especially star cornerback Richard Sherman, have the size and strength to easily disrupt this with press coverage.With defensive linemen capable of slowing the read-option, and cornerbacks who can press the Redskins' receivers in the short passing game, the biggest determining factor in the battle between Washington's offense and Seattle's defense will be the play of strongside linebacker K.J. Wright. The Seahawks' defensive line scheme frequently leaves a large amount of space in the left B-gap (between the offense's left tackle and left guard) when pass-rushing, and against a runner of Griffin's caliber, such a hole in the defense has the potential to be devastating. Wright's ability to watch that gap and play the ""spy"" role on his own to keep Griffin from running off the left guard when pass plays break down will determine how successfully Washington can move the ball against Seattle's defense. If Wright is undisciplined and sloppy with his containment, Griffin can repeatedly escape the pocket and keep creating big plays on offense. If Wright can keep Griffin from running through the left B-gap, the rest of the Seahawks' matchup advantages can bottle up the Redskins' offense.Seahawks' offense vs. Redskins' defenseThe Redskins' defense is at its worst when defending against the type of things the Seahawks are capable of doing best, so Washington defensive coordinator Jim Haslett is going to have his hands full. The Seahawks' offense is going to be most successful if it lets quarterback Russell Wilson's legs control the game. The Redskins' defense flows fast to the football, following the offensive line's pulls and traps to get to the running back's holes. The downfall of a ""fast-flow"" defensive style, though, is a lack of backside containment. The Seahawks can exploit this by running a lot of play-fakes of naked bootlegs, with Wilson rolling to the right after handoffs and occasionally keeping the ball off of play-action for a big run or pass if the defense flows too fast to running back Marshawn Lynch. The Carolina Panthers employed this strategy against Washington in Week Nine, and it was a resounding success. With quarterback Cam Newton as the triggerman on their read-option attack, the Panthers, 1-6 at the time, were able to snap their five-game losing streak and defeat the Redskins 21-13.Another lesson learned from watching the Panthers-Redskins game is that Wilson is likely to see an atypically large amount of opportunities to make plays on these bootlegs because of the number of defenders the Redskins' defense will have to commit to defending Lynch, whose hard running style will likely punish the Redskins for their tendency to make arm-tackles. In terms of pure dropback passing, two factors lean in the favor of the Seahawks' offense. The first is that the Redskins' base defense is easily stretched when opposing offenses motion a running back out wide for an empty backfield. This benefits the Seahawks, as Lynch is averaging 8.3 yards per reception - his highest average since his rookie season in 2007.The Redskins' more important weakness in the passing game, though, is that they're a much better man coverage team than they are in zone coverage. Man coverage will leave more defenders with their backs turned to Wilson, giving him ample opportunities to pick up yards on the ground before half the defense even sees that he's taken off running. As a result, the Redskins are going to have to play more zone coverage than they'd like, which benefits the Seahawks' offense.If the Seahawks establish the threat of Wilson rolling right after handoffs and on play-action, and frequently motion Lynch all over the field to help attack weaknesses in the Redskins' zone defenses, Seattle will have little difficulty scoring."

Five Adam Vinatieri field goals were the Colts' output in a 15-6 grinder against a Ravens club favored to win. The 2012 Colts will again have Vinatieri's services in Sunday's wild-card game in Baltimore, but a diet of field goals probably won't get it done in this matchup. The '06 Colts had a stronger defense, one jump-started when S Bob Sanders returned from injury. They also had a playoff-tested Peyton Manning in his prime. Still, the Colts are very capable of giving the Ravens a tough game on Sunday. What rookie QB Andrew Luck lacks in playoff experience he can potentially make up for in sheer talent. Also, the Ravens' defense Luck faces isn't anything as tough as the one Manning had to face in the '06 or '09 playoffs. There's no doubting Luck's play will be key to the Colts' chances Sunday. So too will the Colts' ability to stop Ravens RB Ray Rice. Indianapolis has had some problems against the run. Limiting Rice's impact on the game is a must for the Colts. This brings us back to the subject of special teams. The Colts' play in the third phase of the game could also go a long way in determining whether they can upset Baltimore. If the Colts aren't sharp on special-teams coverage, it could cost them dearly against Baltimore, which has one of the game's most dynamic return threats in Jacoby Jones. Jones returned a pair of kickoffs for scores in the regular season and added a punt-return TD in the Ravens' important Week 11 win at Pittsburgh. While the Colts are just No. 26 in opponent punt-return average and No. 22 in opponent kickoff-return average, they have surrendered just one special-teams score, a punt TD to New England's Julian Edelman on Nov. 18. Edelman's second-quarter TD erased the Colts' 14-7 lead at New England, and Indianapolis wouldn't lead again in a 59-24 defeat. Pat McAfee handles punts and kickoffs for the Colts. He averaged 69.1 yards on 79 kickoffs with 45 touchbacks. He punted 73 times, averaging 40.3 net yards. Just 32 of his punts were returned, and he forced 14 fair catches. It should be noted that the Ravens' coverage units have some challenges of their own, what with the Colts having returned a kickoff and punt for scores this season. Special teams played a major role in the Colts' last playoff win in Baltimore. We know Vinatieri doesn't figure to blink on the playoff stage. Surely the Colts would love to have a chance to turn the game over to him in the final moments. To get to that point, though, they will likely need to be sound. If they give anything away, the veteran Ravens will capitalize, and this extends to the oh-so-important kicking game. "

You would be amazed as to how many marriages have little or no intimacy from a lack of trust to a lack of sex. 3. You are overwhelmed with debt. Financial instability is a major reason for divorce. 4. You have a problem with alcohol, drugs or prescription medications that you fail to deal with. Face these problems or before you know it, you may not have a marriage.  5. You spend more and more time away from your home and family. You let your career and outside interests overtake your family life. I see this in many of my divorce cases. 6. You have an affair or perhaps many. Your intimacy is with someone other than your spouse. You become emotionally involved with someone else.  7. You ignore birthdays, anniversaries and other important moments in your life and those of your spouse and children. Little things mean a lot. You would be amazed as to how many people come to me who no longer celebrate or even remember special events.  8. You are addicted to the internet and have no time for your family. The internet and social media play a major role in many breakups. 9. You are physically or emotionally and verbally abusive to your spouse and family. Abuse is a major cause of divorce. 10. You are addicted to pornography.  11. You are a shop-a-holic. I have seen cases where one or both spouses are out of control with spending and hoarding. 12. You no longer love your spouse and are unwilling to seek counseling or work on your marriage. A third party can be critical to help get a marriage back on track. 13. You can't let go of issues and move on. You can't forgive your spouse for real or imagined mistakes or indiscretions. You have unrealistic expectations that your spouse can never live up to.

The common factor amongst all of these women is that they say that their husbands are really solid, good, nice men ... they just don't want to be married to them anymore because they have fallen out of love.Honaman doesn't say how old these women are or how long they've been married, but since she indicates they have another 40-plus years ahead of them, it seems that they are middle-aged, too.Why is midlife so wrought with angst for women? One study found that age 48 is the pivotal year for women's unhappiness, and women tend to be more prone to depression anyway. But at midlife, we're dealing with menopause, the loss of our role as nurturer, the loss of our youth and beauty, etc.And, sure -- some women have been inspired by the ""Eat, Pray, Love"" syndrome: After raising a family and tending to the home and baking Lord-knows-how-many brownies for Boy Scout fundraisers and volunteering to drive on countless field trips while doing paid or non-paid work (and, yes, being a stay-at-home parent is work), many feel it's finally ""me"" time. We want to stop nurturing others and start nurturing ourselves. We want to feel a little bit selfish instead of selfless, even if we don't find ourselves in Italy or India.Older women are ""the most dangerous on the planet,"" Jane Fonda says. ""We have nothing to lose!"" That doesn't mean we're all filing for divorce. There are many women who live in loveless and sexless marriages for a variety of reasons (as do men, although at least some 50-something men left their marriage because they ""fell out of love"" or realized they had ""different values or lifestyles,"" according to an AARP study). As Pamela Haag discovered while researching for her book ""Marriage Confidential, ""33 percent of respondents agreed that 'even if you're unhappy, you should stick it out for the children.' That's up from 20 percent in a 1970 survey."" And as Pamela Paul detailed in a New York Times piece called ""The Un-divorced,"" many couples live together but have separate lives. So much for being married happily ever after.But since two-thirds of all divorces are initiated by women and many women tend to do well after divorce, I have to wonder -- are middle-aged women done with men?For some, yes. There are many who put aside their needs, including sexual, to focus on their kids. There are also many women who prefer the company of girlfriends to men, throw themselves into their career and travel, and relish their freedom. There are also many women who want to find love again but give up -- frustrated, unhappy or uncomfortable with the 50-plus dating scene. And then there are older women who are happily dating or in relationships. According to that same AARP study, most divorced women in midlife do find someone new -- 75 percent of women in their 50s reported enjoying serious, exclusive relationships after their divorces, often within two years, compared with 81 percent of men in their 50s (although more older men tend to marry again than older women).All of which would indicate that, no, women in their 50s and beyond are most certainly not done with men.We just may be done with marriage.This story appears in Issue 32 of our weekly iPad magazine, Huffington, in the iTunes App store, available Friday, Jan. 18.

Indian police were preparing Thursday to file rape and murder charges against a group of men accused of sexually assaulting the 23-year-old university student for hours on a moving bus in New Delhi. The Dec. 16 attack on the woman, who later died of her injuries, has caused outrage across India, sparking protests and demands for tough new rape laws, better police protection for women and a sustained campaign to change society's views about women. (AP Photo/Altaf Qadri)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2a59f3c000032000aec4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Warning: This post contains graphic depictions of sexualized violence. The same small part of me that still wants to believe in faeries wanted to think that I could avoid thinking or writing about rape for at least a few weeks. But, it's impossible. Not with laws in California that say single women can't, in effect, be raped and when the night-long gang-rape of a 16-year-old unconscious girl ""divides"" a community dedicated to its football team. Definitely not when ongoing details about the death of a 23-year-old in Delhi, whose rape to the point of disembowelment and multiple organ failure, are spurring protests all over the world.No matter where you are in the world, the result of rape -- ""date rape,"" ""gang-rape,"" ""easy rape,"" ""emergency rape,"" ""war rape"" -- is the same: oppression. Women are not free to live without the constant threat of assault and violence or without being treated like objects and property. When I last checked there were at least four ""rape capitals"" of the world. You know what that makes the rest of us? ""Rape Suburbs."" Girls and women aren't idiots. On the contrary, we understand perfectly: we're supposed to ""be careful."" Don't do something we might ""regret."" ""Stay home."" ""So what if it happens, anyway?"" We can't feel any security that our bodily integrity will be respected. Or that our consent matters. We cannot enjoy the confident access and ownership of public space that men do. Our attempts to pursue equality and opportunity are inhibited, not only by actual rape, but by people's malevolent tolerance for it. Rape is useful, even the rape of boys and men: it sustains a system that rewards physical dominance and sustains male hegemony. When precisely doesn't a girl or woman think ""she could have been me?"" What teenage girl in the United States won't think a little harder about going to parties? Or even to sleep? When it's too scary to consider the facts or when it's easier to align oneself with the dominant and powerful, blame the victim, in the hope of ""protection."" Today, more girls, no matter how briefly, will consider being drugged and raped by a self-anointed ""Rape Crew"" like the one in Steubenville, Ohio. If you missed this past week's revelations, this rape continues to elicit shock and repugnance. If it weren't for the doggedness of blogger Alexandra Goddard and the outrage of Anonymous (yes, that Anonymous) this night-long assault of an unconscious girl, literally dragged and periodically violated, urinated on and photographed would have faded into nothingness. All of this happened while up to 50 other girls and boys were present -- each deriving specific but different messages about what was happening. And, THAT's the point isn't it? A warning to girls or the boys who would help them. It's not just that this happened, and variations of it happen every day, but it's the idea that it could happen. All over the planet. If we take risks -- like living -- and are raped, people are comfortable saying we ""lured"" men, even if you are an 11-year-old girl, like the one in Texas raped by more than 18 of them or boys molested by priests. And, yes, I know that boys and men are raped. They suffer tremendously. Often, they have no support, cannot get the help they need and live entire lives with great pain. But, this is related, because when boys and men are raped not only are they violated, but they are shamed by being ""made"" into girls and women as a way of debasing them and demonstrating their worthlessness. That's a message, too, by the way. And, yes, I am writing in terms of sex binaries -- because they are essential to this system of oppression. The heightened chance of assault that people who do not ""fit,"" people who are sex or gender fluid, experience illustrates the point. People who don't adhere transgress too far and threaten too much. Is there any greater demonstration that rape is about power and domination and not about sex than the gang-rapes that we are now openly discussing? At its core, does it matter that rape involves rusted pipes in India, rats fed into women's vaginas in Syria, fists used to bludgeon girls in France or drugs to incapacitate girls in the U.S.? I don't get the point of not making comparisons when they're screaming, jumping up and down, making themselves. Strictly speaking, eliding a gang-rape in India with one in the U.S., or say France, leaves out important contextual information -- societal, cultural, legal and judicial -- there are profound connections in the ways in which the perpetrators of these crimes are taught -- at home, in schools, via religions, in sports -- to denigrate the feminine and females as a path to glorifying their masculinity, to demonstrate their dominance and superiority by proving the worthlessness of girls and women. All while simultaneously constructing unattainable ideals and perverted applications of female ""purity."" In India, where rape is one aspect of a deeply entrenched culture of misogyny with unrelenting permutations of violence against girls and women, it took the much publicized and catalytic death of this girl to finally pitch people into public outrage. However, despite the fact that it is one of the worst places to be a girl or woman, India has no monopoly on telling women to ""submit,"" on rape and victim blaming. Or violence against women. It's just more obvious about it. The sheer mass of people and of evident hatred finally made it impossible for them to blatantly ignore misogyny. Like we want to. Although I would genuinely like to think that globally we are at a strategic inflection point in regards to violence against women, I have grave doubts. As Jessica Valenti points out, we have a rape problem, but we stubbornly ""refuse to admit it."" In the past few weeks of media coverage and conversation, the subtext that ""we're better than that here,"" and that India's ""misogyny"" and ""patriarchy"" are somehow unique to India has been unsettling for its suggestion that ""we're just fine"" and ""women here have nothing to complain about."" We'd rather fixate on the superficial aspects, like ""social media,"" a tool, not a cause. Or on how desperately an Ohio town needs its football to feel ok about itself. Remember, we can't even elect people who will reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. And here the media fails too. Rape is part of a larger, complex system of violence that is central to our identity. Pretending Steubenville is some kind of quirky outlier, or that kids involved are somehow exceptional, is outright collusion with rapists. And shaking our heads and pointing fingers at India is disingenuous, racist, colonialist, hypocritical bullshit. Lauren Wolfe, director of the Women Under Siege Project, has called for an End Culture of Rape in 2013. As Wolfe and others point out, a first step to challenging rape is to stop victim blaming and focus on perpetrators and the cultures that produces them. She's not just talking about Congo or Syria or Egypt. Boys who allegedly drug a girl and then rape her, kidnap her, rape her again, photograph her, photograph her rape, urinate on her then create videos boasting about it, do it because they are fearless and entitled. (I wrote that sentence out deliberately because I'm sick of seeing ""she was raped"" -- like she was an agent in her assault or that there was no real perpetrator.) These boys were not taught, by fully culpable adults, that these actions are morally repugnant crimes against humanity. Because we laugh about rape and mock people who object. Girls who witnessed these events don't speak up because they have no faith they won't be next, they have no confidence they will be believed, they've learned to internalize the contempt our culture has for them. After all, we teach our children that it's acceptable for boys to be protected from shaming and punishment after they've sexually assaulted, and to attend schools where there are ""rape factories"" and where frat boys play games like ""who would you rape.""Men are overwhelming the perpetrators of rape -- of girls, of boys, of women, or other men. The gendered nature of the crime isn't in dispute. But, they aren't born to rape. And, while I understand that most men aren't walking around feeling all-powerful, or like they have a right to rape, too many clearly do. They feel entitled to it. Taking that cultural entitlement away doesn't oppress men or dehumanize them. It just frees women and people who don't ""fit."""

Salaam is the subject of the documentary, ""The Central Park Five,"" about the 1989 case of five black and Latino teenagers who were convicted of raping a white woman in Central Park. (AP Photo/Sundance Selects, NY Daily News)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badd0dd2000009900ff1f0a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- For the first time in the decade since a New York court overturned the convictions of five teenagers in the 1989 rape and beating of a woman known as the Central Park Jogger, a New York City elected official has called on the city to settle a $250 million federal civil rights suit brought by the now-grown men.On Friday, New York City Comptroller John C. Liu said the city's legal department and lawyers representing the men, known collectively as the Central Park Five, should sit down immediately for settlement talks. Liu cited concerns about mounting and likely multimillion-dollar legal costs in the now 10-year-old case. Similar cases of alleged police misconduct that were settled by the city after far shorter periods of litigation left New York to pay large legal bills and millions of dollars in damages to those harmed.""As the financial steward of the City, my goal is to ensure that we strike a delicate balance between making those with meritorious claims whole while minimizing taxpayer costs,"" Liu said in a statement released after his Harlem press conference. ""In the case of the 'Central Park Five,' I am extremely concerned that the longer we wait, the more the legal bills mount.""When queried by a reporter, Liu added that a settlement would also bring a long and notorious period in city history to a close.""This troubling case has spanned the administrations of four Mayors -- Edward Koch, David Dinkins, Rudolph Giuliani, and now Michael Bloomberg,"" Liu said in his statement. ""In the last year of his third term, Mayor Bloomberg has an historic opportunity to provide closure to all those involved. Let's hope that 2013 is the year when all parties help close this terrible chapter in our City's history, so that New Yorkers can finally put an end to the tragic 'Central Park Five' saga."" In a statement from the city's legal department, also released on Friday, officials denied that police or prosecutors had done anything wrong in the 1989 case. ""As we've said before, the City stands by the decisions made by the detectives and prosecutors,"" said Celeste Koeleveld, a city lawyer who defends New York in public safety matters. She added, ""The charges against the plaintiffs and other youths were based on abundant probable cause, including confessions that withstood intense scrutiny, in full and fair pretrial hearings and at two lengthy public trials, with all of the decisions being affirmed by the appellate courts.""The Central Park Five have argued repeatedly that they were coerced into offering false confessions after 20 to 30 hours of interrogation during which police officers screamed at them, denied them anything to eat or drink, and fed them information about the crime. No physical evidence was ever found to conclusively link any of the five young men to the crime.  As city comptroller, Liu does not have the authority to force New York to settle the case but does play a role in civil suit settlements. He generally sets a budget for settlement offers and must approve any payout. On Friday, he discussed the need to close the Central Park Five case in mostly financial terms and raised questions about the length of the case. Concern for the city's coffers may not have been his only motivation in calling for settlement talks. Liu, an Asian American who is running for mayor in a crowded Democratic field, spent much of 2012 wrestling to keep his campaign on track after his campaign treasurer and a fundraiser were implicated in a fundraising scandal. A witness list in the case against the campaign manager also became public Friday. Liu made his call for settlement talks in Harlem, not far from the building where most of the black and Latino men convicted in the Central Park Jogger case were raised. ""Certainly I think it enhances Mr. Liu's standing in the progressive community and the African-American community,"" said Ronald L. Kuby, a white civil rights lawyer who represented Yusef Salaam, one of the Central Park Five, in his appeal and his effort to avoid registration as a sex offender. ""But in all fairness, this is also a welcome call from an elected official.""""The Central Park Five were done a terrible injustice,"" Kuby continued. ""It is almost inconceivable what has happened to these men. It was an unspeakable wrong, and the people responsible for it have never admitted they were wrong, much less doing wrong, so what happened today should not be minimized.""The city's chief lawyer questioned why someone who has responsibility for New York's financial health would recommend settling the case.""We respectfully disagree with the Comptroller's statements,"" said Michael Cardozo, corporation counsel for New York City, in the legal department's statement. ""Indeed, the Comptroller is not privy to any confidential case information, per a court order. This is akin to publishing a budget report while missing half the data … It's puzzling that the official charged with safeguarding the City's fisc feels we should not defend the City, especially when we believe no constitutional violations occurred.""In response to the legal department's statement, Liu's office emailed HuffPost: ""The reaction from Corporation Counsel is exactly why this matter remains unresolved after 10 years. Shame on the Law Department for not being willing to sit at the negotiating table and finally settle a case that has dragged on for far too long. The Corporation Counsel should know better than anyone that the state of the City's budget has no bearing on the relative merits of any civil-rights case. The Corporation Counsel misunderstands the duties of the Comptroller, which includes mitigating the City's financial risks.""For one of the men mostly deeply affected by the Central Park Jogger case, Liu's call stands in sharp and meaningful contrast to the position the city has taken for the last quarter-century. ""It definitely caught me, I don't want to say off-guard, but in a good way -- I had chills as I was reading Liu's statement,"" said Salaam, now 38. Salaam was just 15 when he was arrested in the Central Park Jogger case. ""To have someone of this magnitude coming out and saying you all need to settle, I think this is going to have a tremendous impact. He's saying this has been drug out for far too long and there was a wrong here that must be righted.""After serving seven years in prison for a crime he insists he did not commit, Salaam was released and forced to register as a sex offender. His conviction was overturned in 2002, and his name was removed from the sex offender registry. Today he works as a wireless communications administrator.Any political benefit Liu may gain is well deserved, said Salaam. On Facebook and Twitter, where Salaam said he communicated with the four men he still refers to as his ""co-defendants"" and with other friends on Friday, several expressed surprise, joy and something else. He said that some, including individuals who do not live in New York City, closed their tweets, retweets and Facebook posts with the words, ""John Liu for Mayor.""In November, another individual running for the city's top elected slot, Tom Allon, also called on New York to settle the case.Salaam does not have a specific settlement figure in mind, he said.""Understand, this was never about money,"" said Salaam. ""It's just that is the only legal means by which a city can acknowledge its wrongs ... There's so much irrevocable damage, there are so many indelible scars that have been placed on us that we will never be able to remove them. So a settlement would just be a good and big gesture for everyone involved. The city would get the opportunity to say, 'You know what? We messed up, and let's right this wrong. Let's put a period at the end of this long story.'"""
