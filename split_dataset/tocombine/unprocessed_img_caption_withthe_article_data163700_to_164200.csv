Sunday evenings have been transformed from the dreaded night when preparation for the following week begins to Downton Night, a blissful evening of mindless, Edwardian fun. But is it mindless? Layered into Julian Fellowes' crackling dialogue are some of the best parenting lessons of the last 90 years. Looking on from our American 21st-century vantage point we feel that Lord and Lady Grantham and their brood have taught us a few things. [Watch out -- spoilers below!]1. Grandparents have a crucial role to play in any family as dispensers of wisdom and healers of souls. No one can put a situation into perspective better than someone who has seen seven decades pass. In times of pain and panic, it is the Dowager who is needed most. 2. If we do not change with the times and listen to those much younger than ourselves -- our children in particular, even when they seem callow and naive -- we will soon become obsolete. The world is spinning on and we must listen to the young or risk forever being a prisoner of 1923 or 2013. Even without a sneak peak of Episode Six, it is clear that Robert better start listening to Matthew. 3. We mustn't wait until caught in the grips of grieving to tell our siblings how much they mean to us.  The sibling relationship is life's longest, and we would be fools take it for granted. 4. A home is truly only a building, even if it is Downton Abbey. Losing it or any other possessions matters little compared to losing those we love. We did not shed a tear when we thought the family would lose their beloved Downton; the same cannot be said of Sybil's passing. 5. If our child finds true love (or friendship), whether or not the object of that love is someone we would have selected, we must rejoice for them. A seeming gentleman might jilt our daughter at the altar, but a good man will love her until her last breath. One need only look at the sad episode of Edith and Anthony versus the true love shared by Sybil and Tom. 6. Our children need and deserve our understanding and forgiveness -- true forgiveness, even when they have done wrong. We love them and that love must transcend their mistakes. Mary's painful transgression with Kemal Pamuk did not deprive her of her father's love.7. Never underestimate the power of a well-chosen few words. Speaking softly but strongly can have amazing results. The Dowager and Dr. Clarkson chose their words judiciously so that even though Cora's heart was breaking, she was not alone. 8. People can reinvent themselves -- just give them a chance to prove that they've changed, and avoid being judgmental and closed-minded, as the family was with Ethel.9. When our deepest gut feeling tells us that there is something wrong with our child, even when experts may not agree, we need to follow our gut. Watching our child for a lifetime, through all of its up and downs, makes us an expert. No one knew Sybil better than her own mother.10. Turning on those we love at life's worst moments -- although perhaps understandable in our rage -- will only magnify our grief. True consolation and understanding come from those we love the most, as Robert and Cora learn. 11. If someone truly cares for us, we should give them the chance to show how much. It is amazing what good things happen when we let love into our lives, as Daisy did with Mr. Mason.12. When things are difficult, it helps to have someone to talk to honestly. True friendships are one of life's greatest gifts. We must not keep our problems bottled up inside. Where would Mrs. Hughes be without the loyal Mrs. Patmore? 13. We should teach our children to have faith in the people they love, even at the worst of times, like Anna and Mr. Bates.14. If we have different rules and standards for our sons and daughters, things will not go well. If Mary could have inherited Downton Abbey, the show might have ended after the first season.15. We must teach our children to be careful with their trust and alliances. Some who appear to be their friends will betray them. It is hard to know if someone is an O'Brien or a Thomas.16. The loyalty and love of our children is one of life's greatest blessings, never to be taken lightly. Mary's loyalty to her father, when he is right and even when he is wrong, is a source of comfort and strength. 17. We don't need to like or even approve of everything our children do, but we can still offer encouragement. When our children's passions emerge and they show real enterprise, they need us as their supporters. It is hard not to imagine that someday Robert will be proud of a daughter who is a successful journalist."

Representatives for AMR and US Airways declined to comment.A combination with US Airways would create the world's top airline by passenger traffic and help the two carriers better compete with rivals United Continental Holdings and Delta Air Lines Inc.A near-$11 billion valuation of the combined American-US Airways compares to some $12.4 billion market capitalization for Delta, and $8.7 billion for United Continental.The currently planned equity split ratio between AMR creditors and US Airways shareholders implies a roughly $3 billion valuation for US Airways and some $7.5 billion to $8 billion valuation for AMR. NEW AMERICAN AIRLINESUS Airways will follow through on its agreement with AMR labor unions last year that the combined carrier would be branded American Airlines and be based in Fort Worth, Texas, where AMR is currently based, sources said. US Airways has its headquarters in Tempe, Arizona.As part of the merger, US Airways will also leave the Star Alliance to join the oneworld global airline alliance, of which American Airlines is an anchor member along with British Airways, the people familiar with the matter said.The airlines are estimating that a merger will bring about $1 billion in revenue and cost benefits, they said.Horton rebuffed an aggressive takeover push from US Airways early in the bankruptcy process, saying the airline preferred to exit court protection on its own and consider a deal later. But after several months of talks with its own creditors as well as with US Airways, Horton has softened his approach and agreed to consider all options.A combined American-US Airways would provide the scale to match bigger rivals that are upgrading service and expanding international routes. The merged company would have revenue of $38.69 billion based on 2012 figures, ahead of United Continental which had revenue of $37.15 billion last year.The new American would have a solid presence on the important U.S. East and West coasts and on North Atlantic routes, given American's revenue-sharing joint venture with British Airways and Iberia."

But as governments play down the health risks, a greater impact may stem from a shattering of public confidence in EU systems of labelling and quality control introduced after previous threats hit the human food chain.As details emerge of a complex network of slaughterhouses and middlemen standing between the farm and the supermarkets across Europe, France and Britain have vowed to punish those found responsible for selling horsemeat purporting to be beef.With DNA tests needed to tell the two kinds of flesh apart, retailers and makers of processed meals complain of being duped by suppliers; one French firm has pointed a finger at Romania.""This is a conspiracy against the public,"" said British farm minister Owen Paterson. ""I've got an increasing feeling that it is actually a case of an international criminal conspiracy.""Prime Minister David Cameron has called it ""very shocking"".Adding to concerns are indications that some horsemeat, perfectly edible in itself, may contain a drug known as bute - a common, anti-inflammatory painkiller for sporting horses but banned for animals intended for eventual human consumption.Britain's Food Standards Agency said it was checking whether horse carcasses exported from Britain contained phenylbutazone. It said five such animals were sold abroad last year and it had told foreign agencies. French media said the horses went there.One firm hit by the British horsemeat scandal, frozen foods group Findus, said it was recalling its beef lasagne product after discovering they included horsemeat. Its French supplier, Comigel, said the questionable meat came from EU member Romania.An EU-wide alert has been sent out and governments debated how to bring the increasingly complex industry under control.Food experts say globalisation has brought benefits to food supply, with exotic items now available from around the world all year round, but it has also created a system that is so complex it has increased the risks of adulteration, whether by design, to use cheaper inputs, or through neglect of standards.The ""mad cow"" crisis, which saw British beef banned in the EU in the 1990s over fears of a degenerative brain disease, left a legacy of tight controls on the identity of European animals, intended to ensure the origins of fresh meat are traceable.But in meat minced into processed product, while hygiene checks are the norm, testing for something as seemingly basic as which species it came from is complex and not widely undertaken.Mystery over the contents of a sausage is far from new, but mass production means any problem can escalate rapidly:""Food adulteration has been going on for as long as it has been prepared, for thousands of years,"" said Chris Elliot, a professor working on food safety at Queen's University Belfast.""We are at the stage now where whenever this adulteration happens, it tends to happen on a very large scale, extremely well organised."" REPULSEDDoubts over quality controls in processed food could damage sales across Europe, but the greatest impact of this scandal may be in Britain, where assurances that horsemeat is safe have done little to lessen the disgust felt by many, or suspicions that it reflects another unpopular aspect of membership of the EU bloc.One leading British lawmaker called for a ban on EU imports.""Nabbed, stabbed and beaten: wild horses to go in our beef,"" ran the headline on Sunday's mass-selling Sun newspaper over a story alleging cruelty to horses to be slaughtered in Romania.From Queen Elizabeth downwards, Britons cast themselves as a nation of horse lovers, treating sporting thoroughbreds with no less reverence than human athletes and viewing the species as whole with an affection rivaled only by that for the family dog.There are only a handful of licensed horse abattoirs in Britain, and these mostly export carcasses to the continent, where Italy leads consumption tables with an unsentimental taste for both horse and donkey; horsemeat also has a niche in the cuisine of France and of many other European nations.At a Sunday market in north London, where shoppers strolled among rain-soaked stalls selling vegetables, sausage and cheeses direct from the small farms that produce them, many said they would buy fewer frozen ready-meals after the revelations.That is good news for the likes of Amie Peters, who runs a family beef burger business: ""They've kept it secret from everyone. It was concealed from the public. That's not nice,"" she said of equine DNA found in supermarket burgers, nodding to her own grill and adding with a smile: ""No horsemeat in these.""Distaste for horsemeat is widely shared across the English-speaking world, although the U.S. Congress in 2011 overturned a five-year-old effective ban on slaughtering horses for food. TRACING BACKTracing processed meat back to its source is difficult in Europe's complex market, and the path from abattoirs where cows and horses are slaughtered and minced to people's dinner tables often meanders through a confusing chain of middle companies.Last week's problems for Findus came less than a month after British supermarket Tesco and fast food outlet Burger King found horsemeat in beef burgers from Ireland.French officials tracing the contamination of the Findus beef lasagne said a Luxembourg factory had been supplied by the French firm Poujol, which had bought the meat frozen from a Cypriot trader, who in turn had subcontracted the order to a Dutch trader supplied by a Romanian abattoir.However, Comigel, a frozen foods producer based in eastern France, told a newspaper it had bought the meat from another French company, supplied from a Romanian abattoir.In Romania, officials said one of the two Romanian abattoirs suspected to have provided horsemeat had been cleared of all suspicion: ""I believe that, even though the investigation isn't finished, that everything left the country properly and officially,"" Constantin Savu of Romania's food safety authority was quoted as saying by state news agency Agerpres on Sunday.""I find it hard to believe that such errors could exist.""In France, six big retailers said they were recalling lasagne and other products suspected to be mislabelled.Britain's Paterson summoned leading food retailers and representatives of food processors to an emergency meeting at his office at the weekend to discuss the crisis.Anne McIntosh, who chairs the parliamentary food and environment committee, called for a temporary import ban on processed and frozen meats from the other 26 EU states.""My concern is that consumer confidence will have collapsed across the European Union,"" McIntosh, from Cameron's Conservative party, told the BBC on Sunday.""We seem to be no clearer as to what the source of this contamination is, or whether the supply was ever destined for human consumption. Is this a fraud of such a massive scale that it should never have entered the human food chains?""

Our borrowing temporarily outpaces our growth in order to offset some disaster.But there are also good reasons to lower the debt ratio when the economy's solidly back on track. First of all, in weak economies, interest rates tend to fall and servicing our growing public debt tends to be the least of our worries. But as the economy improves and interest rates go up, it's more expensive to service a larger stock of debt, so in the ""interest"" of not having to devote resources to debt service that we might rather use for education, infrastructure, and so on, it's good to get the debt on a declining trajectory.Also, a lower debt ratio leaves you better positioned the next time your public debt needs to go up. It's easier to make that case when you start at 40 percent -- where we were in 2009 -- than north of 80 percent.A debt ratio that keeps growing in good times and bad signals a persistent imbalance in the willingness to raise the needed revenues to pay for government without borrowing. This sounds like the very definition of unsustainable and eventually government borrowing will crowd out everything else while spooked investors insist on large interest rate premiums, further pressuring the debt spiral. At that point, ""we're Greece"" has more bite.On the other hand, there's Japan, who's debt ratio has been rising since 1990 and is now around 200 percent (that's gross debt; debt held by the public is around 150%, but still, the point is it's gone in one direction for decades). Yet, interest rates remain low and investors still consider Japanese debt to be safe.So one should avoid global rules, like ""a debt ratio over 90 percent spells doom"" or ""if we don't lower our debt ratio the bond vigilantes will attack and force rates way up"" or ""public borrowing always crowds out private borrowing, leading to slower growth."" There's no good evidence for any one of these claims, which is not to say public borrowing, for example, will never compete with private borrowing thus pressuring rates and slowing growth. It's saying, like in the Japan case, you've got to look at cases.Me, I think the best position is to be a Cyclical Dove and a Structural Hawk (CDSH). If you're a CDSH, your fiscal question in recessions and sloggy periods like the US (and much of Europe) are experiencing today is this: ""is our budget deficit large enough to offset the demand contraction from the private sector?""When strong private growth is back, the CDSH asks ""now that we're back to robust growth, are our revenues and spending lined up such that the debt we built up during the down economy will soon start to recede?"" That is, deficits and debt that grow in full employment economies are called ""structural"" budget deficits as distinct from cyclical ones. They're to be avoided.OK, so... back to cases, like right now.As noted, though few are listening, the CDSH fiscal policy right now is ""accelerator now, brake later."" (Although as noted in recent posts, I've shifted from ""help!"" to ""do no harm!"") But this position leaves two interesting and debated questions: when is later and at what level should the debt ratio be stabilized?The first question is easier. It's when the indicators of growth are consistently flashing ""go."" GDP is growing above trend, unemployment is coming down, private investment flows are moving again. Interestingly, the Fed has explicitly adopted this type of rule, based on unemployment and inflation.For a thoughtful debate on the second question -- at what level would we want to stabilize the ratio? -- see these two papers from CBPP, by Richard Kogan, and EPI, by Ethan Pollack (the CBPP analysis will be updated any minute based on new CBO numbers but the results are unlikely to change much).The Center argues for stabilization of the debt ratio at about its current level of 73% by the end of the 10 year budget window. EPI argues that this is an arbitrary level and there no reason not to stabilize at a higher level, which would, of course, require less deficit reduction -- about half of what CBPP calls for -- and thus arguably be less damaging for growth. Both positions are consistent with the tenets of CDSH, but EPI clearly argues for more accelerator now and less brake later.In this spirit, EPI stresses a point I've made many times: more temporary spending now in the interest of jobs would raise the level at which the debt ratio is stabilized but not its growth. Their figure below shows their two stabilization scenarios, both of which stabilize at higher levels than CBPP. The higher line stabilizes at around 85 percent, though if you want to assign a growth multiplier to the stimulus, it would stabilize at a lower level than that, as GDP would grow more quickly (however, beware: both sides can do such ""dynamic scoring"" and R's take such methods to weird, indefensible places).Source: EPI, Ethan PollackSo who's right? I think the two strongest arguments above for CBPPs approach are a) stabilizing at a lower level leaves us less exposed to higher interest payments when rates finally start to rise, and b) it will be a heavier political lift to argue for a cyclical deficits next time we hit a rough patch if we're starting at 85 percent versus 73 percent. But I can certainly see arguments to the contrary.At the end of the day, economic growth is really the most overlooked variable here. At least in my lifetime, the only time I've ever seen the debt ratio fall in earnest was when the economy was at full employment. Though we relentlessly target the numerator of the debt ratio, the real action is in targeting the denominator. That doesn't invite fiscal profligacy -- if you want to hang with the cool kids, you've got to be a CDSH. But it does suggest that once again, we're looking for fiscal rectitude in all the wrong places.*This goal is called primary balance, meaning the gov't is raising enough revenue to pay its annual operating costs, but must still borrow to pay interest costs. The formula for primary balance is d_2/GDP_2=D_1/GDP_1*(g/1+g) where d=deficit, D=debt and g is the nominal GDP growth rate. Right now, using actual GDP 2012 and CBOs 2013 estimate, the nominal growth rate is 3.1 percent, and the 2012 debt/GDP ratio is 72.5 percent. Thus, primary balance for 2013 is a deficit/GDP ratio of about 2.2 percent."

Samsung starts gaining market share, hurting Apple Inc's margins and stock price and threatening its reign as the king of cool in consumer electronics.Jobs, of course, had an answer to all this: a ""thermo-nuclear"" legal war that would keep clones off the market. Yet nearly two years after Apple first filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Samsung, and six months after it won a huge legal victory over its South Korean rival, Apple's chances of blocking the sale of Samsung products are growing dimmer by the day.Indeed, a series of recent court rulings suggests that the smartphone patent wars are now grinding toward a stalemate, with Apple unable to show that its sales have been seriously damaged when rivals, notably Samsung, imitated its products.That, in turn, may usher in a new phase in the complex relationship between the two dominant companies in the growing mobile computing business.Tim Cook, Jobs' successor as Apple chief executive, was opposed to suing Samsung in the first place, according to people with knowledge of the matter, largely because of that company's critical role as a supplier of components for the iPhone and the iPad. Apple bought some $8 billion worth of parts from Samsung last year, analysts estimate.Samsung, meanwhile, has benefited immensely from the market insight it gained from the Apple relationship, and from producing smartphones and tablets that closely resemble Apple's.While the two companies compete fiercely in the high-end smartphone business - where together they control half the sales and virtually all of the profits - their strengths and weaknesses are in many ways complementary. Apple's operations chief, Jeff Williams, told Reuters last month that Samsung was an important partner and they had a strong relationship on the supply side, but declined to elaborate.As their legal war winds down, it is increasingly clear that Apple and Samsung have plenty of common interests as they work to beat back other potential challengers, such as BlackBerry or Microsoft.The contrast with other historic tech industry rivalries is stark. When Apple accused Microsoft in the 1980s of ripping off the Macintosh to create the Windows operating system, Apple's very existence was at stake. Apple lost, the Mac became a niche product, and the company came close to extinction before Jobs returned to Apple in late 1996 and saved it with the iPod and the iPhone. Jobs died in October 2011.Similarly, the Internet browser wars of the late 1990s that pitted Microsoft against Netscape ended with Netscape being sold for scrap and its flagship product abandoned.Apple and Samsung, on the other hand, are not engaged in a corporate death match so much as a multi-layered rivalry that is by turns both friendly and hard-edged. For competitors like Nokia, BlackBerry, Sony, HTC and even Google - whose Motorola unit is expected to launch new smartphones later this year - they are a formidable duo.THE WAY THEY WEREThe partnership piece of the Apple-Samsung relationship dates to 2005, when the Cupertino, California-based giant was looking for a stable supplier of flash memory. Apple had decided to jettison the hard disc drive in creating the iPod shuffle, iPod nano and then-upcoming iPhone, and it needed huge volumes of flash memory chips to provide storage for the devices.The memory market in 2005 was extremely unstable, and Apple wanted to lock in a supplier that was rock-solid financially, people familiar with the relationship said. Samsung held about 50 percent of the NAND flash memory market at that time.""Whoever controls flash is going to control this space in consumer electronics,"" Jobs said at the time, according to a source familiar with the discussions.The success of that deal led to Samsung supplying the crucial application processors for the iPhone and iPad. Initially, the two companies jointly developed the processors based on a design from ARM Holdings Plc, but Apple gradually took full control over development of the chip. Now Samsung merely builds the components at a Texas factory.The companies built a close relationship that extended to the very top: in 2005, Jay Y. Lee, whose grandfather founded the Samsung Group, visited Jobs' home in Palo Alto, California, after the two signed the flash memory deal.The partnership gave Apple and Samsung insight into each other's strategies and operations. In particular, Samsung's position as the sole supplier of iPhone processors gave it valuable data on just how big Apple thought the smartphone market was going to be.""Having a relationship with Apple as a supplier, I am sure, helped the whole group see where the puck was going,"" said Horace Dediu, a former analyst at Nokia who now works as a consultant and runs an influential blog. ""It's a very important advantage in this business if you know where to commit capital.""Samsung declined to comment on its relationship with a specific customer.As for Apple, it reaped the benefit of Samsung's heavy investments in research and development, tooling equipment and production facilities. Samsung spent $21 billion (23 trillion won) on capital expenditures in 2012 alone, and plans to spend a similar amount this year.By comparison, Intel Corp spent around $11 billion in 2012, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) expects to spend $9 billion in 2013.But component expertise, cash and good market intelligence did not assure success when Samsung launched its own foray into the smartphone market. The Omnia, a Windows-based product introduced in 2009, was so reviled that some customers hammered it to bits in public displays of dissatisfaction.Meanwhile, Samsung publicly dismissed the iPhone's success.""The popularity of iPhone is a mere result of excitement caused by some (Apple) fanatics,"" Samsung's then-president, G.S. Choi, told reporters in January 2010.Privately, though, Samsung had other plans.""The iPhone's emergence means the time we have to change our methods has arrived,"" Samsung mobile business head J.K. Shin told his staff in early 2010, according to an internal email filed in U.S. court.Later that year, Samsung launched the Galaxy S, which sported the Android operating system and a look and feel very similar to the iPhone.STANDOFFJobs and Cook complained to top Samsung executives when they were visiting Cupertino. Apple expected, incorrectly, that Samsung would modify its design in response to the concerns, people familiar with the situation said.Apple's worst fears were confirmed with the early 2011 release of the Galaxy Tab, which Jobs and others regarded as a clear rip-off of the iPad.Cook, worried about the critical supplier relationship, was opposed to suing Samsung. But Jobs had run out of patience, suspecting that Samsung was counting on the supplier relationship to shield it from retribution.Apple filed suit in April 2011, and the conflagration soon spread to courts in Europe, Asia and Australia. When Apple won its blockbuster billion-dollar jury verdict against Samsung last August, it appeared that it might be able to achieve an outright ban on the offending products - which would have dramatically altered the smartphone competition.But Apple has failed to convince U.S. judges to uphold those crucial sales bans - in large part because the extraordinary profitability and market power of the iPhone made it all but impossible for Apple to show it was suffering irreparable harm.""Samsung may have cut into Apple's customer base somewhat, but there is no suggestion that Samsung will wipe out Apple's customer base, or force Apple out of the business of making smartphones,"" U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh wrote. ""The present case involves lost sales - not a lost ability to be a viable market participant.""Samsung, meanwhile, came under pressure from antitrust regulators and pulled back on its effort to shut down Apple sales in Europe over a related patent dispute.A U.S. appeals court recently rejected Apple's bid to fast-track its case, meaning its hopes for a sales ban are now stuck in months-long appeals, during which time Samsung may very well release the next version of its hot-selling Galaxy phone.THE WORLD IS OURSThe legal battles have been less poisonous to the relationship than some of the rhetoric suggests.""People play this stuff up because it shows a kind of drama, but the business reality is that the temperature isn't that high,"" said one attorney who has observed executives from both companies.Still, the hostilities appear to have put some dents in the partnership. Apple is likely to switch to TSMC for the building of application processors, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, Sanford Bernstein and other firms. But analysts at Korea Investment & Securities and HMC Securities point out that Apple will not be able to eliminate Samsung as a flash supplier because it remains the dominant producer of the crucial chips.Apple declined to comment on the details of its relationships with any one supplier.Meanwhile, both companies are deploying strategies out of the other's playbook as they seek to maintain and extend their lead over the pack.Samsung has developed a cheeky, memorable TV ad that mocks Apple customers, and dramatically ramped up spending on marketing and advertising, a cornerstone of Apple's success. U.S. ad spending on the Galaxy alone leaped to nearly $202 million in the first nine months of 2012, from $66.6 million in 2011, according to Kantar Media.For its part, Apple is investing in manufacturing by helping its suppliers procure the machinery needed to build large-scale plants devoted exclusively to the company.Apple spent about $10 billion in fiscal 2012 on capital expenditures, and it expects to spend a further $10 billion this year. By contrast, the company spent only $4.6 billion in fiscal 2011 and $2.6 billion in fiscal 2010.But Apple and Samsung retain very different strategies. Apple has just one smartphone and only four product lines in total, and tries to keep variations to a bare minimum while focusing on the high end of the market.Samsung, by contrast, has 37 phone products that are tweaked for regional tastes and run the gamut from very cheap to very expensive, according to Mirae Asset Securities. The company also makes chips, TVs, appliances and a host of other products (and its brethren in the Samsung Group sell everything from ships to insurance policies).Apple devices are hugely popular in the United States; Samsung enjoys supremacy in developing countries like India and China. Apple keeps its core staff lean - it has only 60,000 employees worldwide - and relies on partners for manufacturing and other functions. Samsung Electronics, part of a sprawling ""chaebol,"" or conglomerate, that includes some 80 companies employing 369,000 people worldwide, is far more vertically integrated.It is those differences, combined with the formidable strengths that both companies bring to the market, that may render quiet cooperation a better strategy than all-out war for some time to come.Said Brad Silverberg, a former Microsoft executive who was involved in the Mac vs. Windows wars, ""Apple had learnt a lot of lessons from those days.""(Reporting by Dan Levine and Poornima Gupta in San Francisco, and Miyoung Kim in Seoul; Editing by Jonathan Weber, Tiffany Wu and Peter Cooney)"

(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb416323c000066000c8326.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In his recent movie review for the newly released Identity Theft , Rex Reed refers to Melissa McCarthy as tractor-sized, humongous, obese and a female hippo. Rex Reed hated the film, tearing apart the screenplay, the direction and even the very premise. He has every right to his opinion on the film as a whole; however, he goes too far when he attacks the weight of one of its stars.According to OutofAfrica.com the average hippo is 15 feet in length and weighs about 3.5 tons, or 7,000 pounds. Hippos are also incredibly aggressive towards humans making them one of the most dangerous large animals in Africa. I don't know Melissa McCarthy's weight but I would take a wild guess that it is nowhere near 7,000 pounds. I also doubt that she would be considered dangerous or aggressive. The average weight of a farm tractor is 18,661 pounds, or roughly 2.5 hippos, so she is not quite as heavy as a tractor either. His use of the term, humongous is subjective I guess, but it is especially harsh since the origin of the word comes from combining huge with monstrous.The Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines obesity on a person having a Body Mass Index or (BMI) of 30 or higher. The CDC lists the average weight of an American woman at 166 lb. with a waist circumference of 37.5 inches. I don't know McCarthy's specifics, but based on photos I would have to make a guess that she would probably be classified as obese. The CDC estimates that approx. 35.9% of adult Americans would be considered obese. Since such a significant portion of the population has a BMI of 30 or higher, is it really so extraordinary that an actress of that size appear as a lead character in a film? Wouldn't one-third of the country want to occasionally see someone who represents what they look like on the silver screen?What does her size matter in this or any film? It is not like she is portraying a personal trainer, runway model or starving refugee. In this movie, her weight is about as relevant as her eye and hair color. If the role specifically needed a slim woman that he might have a point, but in this case her weight might have actually helped her get the part. She is portraying a common thief in Florida, shouldn't she reflect the weight of a more common American? Not every story or character calls for the usual 22-year-old Hollywood waif.I suspect that McCarthy's gender may have played a role in being ridiculed for being overweight. Eric Stonestreet best known for his performance of Cameron Tucker in the acclaimed hit television show, Modern Family, is hardly svelte. Stonestreet is heavily featured in the film's trailer yet Mr. Reed didn't see the need to call him a beached whale. He didn't even mention him in his review. Could we just move on from talking the size of any actor or actress? Most actresses in American films are alarming slender. When someone as slim and in shape as the awarding winning actress, Jennifer Lawrence complains about being considered a fat actress by Hollywood standards, clearly the criterion in Hollywood is completely out of whack. Shouldn't it be about talent or finding the best actress for any specific role?Haven't we had enough already? Isn't the success of the film Bridesmaids proof enough that an obese actress can not only be extremely entertaining but help make a movie into a blockbuster? According to BoxOfficemojo.com the world-wide gross for Bridesmaids was over $288 million dollars. Somehow I don't think it would have been as successful without the hysterical McCarthy, no matter what her BMI."
