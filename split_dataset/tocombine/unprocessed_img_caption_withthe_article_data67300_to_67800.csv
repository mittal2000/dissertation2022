The last survivor of a deadly apocalypse on the left. Now that's what we call versatility. Will Forte raised (lowered?) the bar for fashion in 2016 with a look that can only be described with one word: commitment.The ""Last Man on Earth"" star, who attended Fox's 2016 Winter TCA Tour All-Star Party on Friday night, shaved half of his head and face, leaving the actor hairless on the right side and looking like Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"" on the left. The front: The back: Forte luckily found a fashion companion in co-star Mel Rodriguez, who sported a similarly sheared look.For all those not down with Forte's facial hair statement, just you wait. In six months Kendall Jenner will be stomping down the Versace runway in a ""Victor/Victoria""-inspired half-beard, and Forte will be two-finger clapping in the front row. Also on HuffPost:"

Per that agreement, Iran had dismantled more than 12,000 uranium enrichment centrifuges. The core of the Arak heavy water reactor had been decommissioned, preventing its use for the production of plutonium. Iran has agreed that the reactor would be redesigned so that it could not be used to produce weapons grade plutonium. In addition, some 25,000 pounds of spent nuclear fuel, roughly 98% of Iran's stockpile, and including all of the fuel that had been enriched to 20% or more U 235, had been sent to Russia.Almost immediately, the European Union and the United States announced that the sanctions that had previously been imposed on Iran were being lifted. Virtually all of the sanctions imposed by the E.U. were eliminated. Some, but not all, of the U.S. sanctions were also rescinded. The key sanctions, however, were now history. Financial assets valued at between $100 billion and $150 billion have been released to Tehran. Additionally, trade sanctions that had limited Iranian exports of oil, and which had embargoed Iranian imports of a broad number of goods, were also lifted. Iran is now free to participate in the global trade of nations without any restrictions.Now what?In the U.S., the Republican contenders for their party's nomination roundly criticized the lifting of sanctions -- promising to ""rip up the agreement"" should they be elected president. Although in theory, the mechanism exists to re-impose sanctions should Tehran violate the terms of the nuclear agreement; from a practical standpoint this seems highly unlikely. Tehran will move quickly to take control of its overseas financial assets. It will hardly return them should sanctions be re-imposed in the future. Iran also announced plans to ratchet up its oil production from two million BOPD to three million BOPD, sending further shock waves into the currently unstable international petroleum market.The essence of the agreement that Iran signed with the P5 +1 committee was that it would effectively defer its current nuclear development program for at least the next ten years in return for the lifting of the economic sanctions that had been imposed by the U.S. and the E.U. The ""nuclear agreement"" did not restrict Iran's ability to continue the development of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. Such tests were banned by U.N. Security Council resolution 1929 passed in 2010. Tehran, however, has tested such missiles, in violation of that resolution, at least eight times since 2010. The most recent tests were on October 10 and November 21, 2015. If Iran truly was close to announcing the acquisition of nuclear weapons, then the agreement will defer the development and deployment of such weapons, assuming that Iran does not cheat on the agreement, for at least another decade.  Iranian missile testIf on the other hand, Tehran was still a way off from developing such weapons, and in particular from the development of warheads and of the intermediate and long-range ballistic missiles capable of delivering them, then the Obama administration and the E.U. traded sanctions in return for a capability that Tehran did not yet really possess. Based on my own conversations with a number of intelligence agencies around the world, I do not believe that Iran was anywhere close to developing feasible nuclear weapons. In short, Tehran gave up a capability that it didn't have in return for the very real relief of sanctions and access to a financial windfall of frozen financial assets.The immediate impact of the lifting of sanctions is that Iran will gain immediate access to Western industrial technology. In particular, this includes oil field technology that it desperately needs to revitalize many of its aging petroleum fields as well as to expand production from existing fields and develop newly discovered oil deposits. The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) is currently producing approximately two million BOPD a day. It has announced plans to immediately increase production by another 500,000 BOPD, and to further increase production by an additional 500,000 BOPD, to a total of three million BOPD within another six months.In addition, NIOC has stockpiled an estimated 25 million to 30 million barrels of oil in tankers in the Persian Gulf and in onshore storage facilities that is available for immediate shipment. The roughly one billion dollars worth of petroleum, however, is today worth a fraction of what it would have brought in just 24 months ago. Increasing oil production to three million barrels a day will not be easy. It is unlikely that NIOC will meet its goal of three billion BOPD anytime soon. The more modest target of 2.5 million BOPD is far more likely. Even then, the increase in production, and the windfall from the sale of its current stockpile, will still leave NIOC with far less revenue than it was earning just a few years ago.Far more significant, will be the release of over 100 billion dollars in frozen financial assets. The immediate boost to its finances will help, although, long term, it will not relieve the serious financial pressures that the Tehran government is currently finding itself in. Tehran's assistance to the Assad government in Syria is estimated to currently running in excess of ten billion dollars a year. Add to that the cost of Iran's support for Iraq's Shiite militias and assorted organizations from Hezbollah to various other militant Shiite organizations, and the bill from Tehran's foreign adventures is beyond its current capacity to afford. The recently released foreign funds will help bridge that gap for the next few years, but without a substantial recovery in petroleum prices, it will not solve Tehran's long-term budget gap.Time will tell whether the nuclear agreement with Iran will prove to have been a wise one. I suspect that future historians will not wax as sanguine about the agreement as President Obama or his Secretary of State John Kerry do. The fact is, that notwithstanding other U.N. Security Council resolutions, the agreement does nothing to curb Tehran's further development and testing of long range ballistic missiles. Nor did it force Iran to abstain from continuing its funding of militant organizations or its efforts to politically destabilize its Sunni neighbors.The tragedy is that the combination of economic sanctions and crashing petroleum prices were finally putting sufficient pressure on Tehran to force far more meaningful and wide-ranging concessions from the Iranian government. Patience would have rewarded the U.S. and its E.U. allies with a far better agreement and a much more compliant and responsible Iran. In his rush to create his foreign policy legacy, President Obama impatiently played a winning hand badly. It is a legacy we will come to regret. We will all be the losers for it."

On the one hand it means that:1. Tehran will get major relief from sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) as well as unilateral Western sanctions.2. Iran will receive roughly $90 billion as European countries lift sanctions on major industries such as gold and metal.3. The U.S. will remove major Iranian entities and individuals from the sanctions list.4.

More than 190 waivers have already been granted in the U.S.Moreover, the one-year breakout time will not be realistically adequate to react even if the international community caught Iran cheating. Finally, after 10 years, Iran will be allowed to enrich uranium or spin centrifuges at any level that it desires, and the embargo on Iran's ballistic missile will be lifted.The other question is how will the IAEA inspect all nuclear facilities and verify Iran's compliance?

There is a new kind of video news waiting to be born - but what is it?New technologies come quickly.Their ultimate application can take a lot longer. Sometimes a LOT longer.Not so long ago, making video or television, particularly (but not limited to) television news was both expensive and complicated. A broadcast quality video camera could cost $50,000. A broadcast edit suite could cost as much as $1m. You had to be an engineer, and highly trained to run either. Hardly anyone ran both. If you wanted to make TV journalism, you went to work for a network or a local news channel. There was no other option.Then, suddenly, every smartphone was also a video camera and every laptop or iPad (or smart phone if you were nimble enough) was also a video editor. The technology exploded on the scene. Now, anyone could produce video news at the drop of a hat (or more appropriately, the push of a button)But what would they make -- or more to the point of a conversation on FB initiated by Prof. Duy Linh Tu of Columbia University, what will they make?There is a direct correlation between technologies that empower people to publish their ideas and distribute them, and the 'grammar' of what they actually produce.Today, most people with video cameras more or less ape CNN or other broadcast networks. One of the great failures (to my mind at least) of the unrealized potential of Al Jazeera was that with all their money the only thing they could think to do was to mimic MSNBC or CNN -- studio, reporters, reports.500 years ago, another new technology, the printing press, also empowered millions of people to write and print and publish and distribute whatever they wanted. Just like smart phones and the Internet, it took a means of communication -- writing -- that was until then held by a tiny handful of people (The Church and King with one; the networks and media companies with the other) and opened the door to everyone.What did they do with this new power?I was astonished to learn that although the printing press was invented in 1452, the first novel was not pubished until 1721, with the publications of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe.Shocking, no?The technology for a novel was always there.Johannes Gutenberg could have gone down to his basement, once he finished the bible, and cranked out War and Peace or Portnoy's Complaint.But he didn't.It wasn't for lack of technology. He had the technology. It was for a lack of imagination -- and courage.The natural response to any new technology is to jam it into old ways of thinking. That is why, presented with the printing press, the best Gutenberg could come up with was newer and cheaper bibles.Presented with a new technology in the form of a billion video cameras around the world, the best that the news people can come up with is 'if a tornado is coming to your trailer park, turn it on and maybe we will run some raw video.'Like Gutenberg, not a failure of technology, a failure of creativity.But what could you do with a video camera besides raw shots of disasters as they happened?Let's go back to Defoe and Robinson Crusoe. What made that work? First, Defoe captured all the classic elements of great storytelling since Homer -- a compelling character, great writing and an arc of story - survival.He also made it a first person narrative.Now, do you think, as you look at all the news stories in the world - say the millions of refugees fleeing war in the Middle East, that you could create the same kind of compelling 'novel' in video?I think so too."

Sometimes a LOT longer.Not so long ago, making video or television, particularly (but not limited to) television news was both expensive and complicated. A broadcast quality video camera could cost $50,000. A broadcast edit suite could cost as much as $1m. You had to be an engineer, and highly trained to run either. Hardly anyone ran both. If you wanted to make TV journalism, you went to work for a network or a local news channel. There was no other option.Then, suddenly, every smartphone was also a video camera and every laptop or iPad (or smart phone if you were nimble enough) was also a video editor. The technology exploded on the scene. Now, anyone could produce video news at the drop of a hat (or more appropriately, the push of a button)But what would they make -- or more to the point of a conversation on FB initiated by Prof. Duy Linh Tu of Columbia University, what will they make?There is a direct correlation between technologies that empower people to publish their ideas and distribute them, and the 'grammar' of what they actually produce.Today, most people with video cameras more or less ape CNN or other broadcast networks. One of the great failures (to my mind at least) of the unrealized potential of Al Jazeera was that with all their money the only thing they could think to do was to mimic MSNBC or CNN -- studio, reporters, reports.500 years ago, another new technology, the printing press, also empowered millions of people to write and print and publish and distribute whatever they wanted. Just like smart phones and the Internet, it took a means of communication -- writing -- that was until then held by a tiny handful of people (The Church and King with one; the networks and media companies with the other) and opened the door to everyone.What did they do with this new power?I was astonished to learn that although the printing press was invented in 1452, the first novel was not pubished until 1721, with the publications of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe.Shocking, no?The technology for a novel was always there.Johannes Gutenberg could have gone down to his basement, once he finished the bible, and cranked out War and Peace or Portnoy's Complaint.But he didn't.It wasn't for lack of technology. He had the technology. It was for a lack of imagination -- and courage.The natural response to any new technology is to jam it into old ways of thinking. That is why, presented with the printing press, the best Gutenberg could come up with was newer and cheaper bibles.Presented with a new technology in the form of a billion video cameras around the world, the best that the news people can come up with is 'if a tornado is coming to your trailer park, turn it on and maybe we will run some raw video.'Like Gutenberg, not a failure of technology, a failure of creativity.But what could you do with a video camera besides raw shots of disasters as they happened?Let's go back to Defoe and Robinson Crusoe. What made that work? First, Defoe captured all the classic elements of great storytelling since Homer -- a compelling character, great writing and an arc of story - survival.He also made it a first person narrative.Now, do you think, as you look at all the news stories in the world - say the millions of refugees fleeing war in the Middle East, that you could create the same kind of compelling 'novel' in video?I think so too."
7,POLITICS,Cautious Optimism Over Iran Nuclear Deal,"Tom Mockaitis, ContributorInternational security analyst/military historian. Prof. of Hi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cautious-optism-over-iran_b_9004200.html,"Like it or not, a country the size of Iran, which is enmeshed in several regional crises, can neither be ignored nor forced into submission without disastrous consequences.",2016-01-17,"TEHRAN, IRAN - JANUARY 17: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (C) gives a speech during a press conference in Tehran, Iran on January 17, 2016. Yesterday, international sanctions on Iran were lifted within nuclear deal. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb92cf73c000032000e11d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Diplomacy entails risks, especially when one side appears to be offering concrete concessions in return for promises from the other. Concern that the U.S. and its allies are doing just that has led Congressional Republicans and presidential hopefuls to oppose the Iran Nuclear deal. Developments over the past week should, however, encourage skeptics to reconsider their positions. Hardliners who, despite recent progress, still oppose the agreement must offer a constructive alternative other than the ridiculous chant, ""bomb, bomb Iran."" Like it or not, a country the size of Iran, which is enmeshed in several regional crises, can neither be ignored nor forced into submission without disastrous consequences.The agreement between the permanent five members of the UN Security Council and the European Union is already producing results. The International Atomic energy verified that Iran has shut down 12,000 centrifuges, exported 98% of its nuclear fuel to Russia, and deactivated a plutonium reactor in return for unfreezing $1 billion in Iranian assets. Independent of the nuclear deal, but clearly related to it, the U.S. and Iran have exchanged prisoners. When two American gunboats strayed into Iranian territorial waters and were temporarily held last week, the two sides resolved the issue expeditiously. While hardly a reason to celebrate an end to decades of hostility, these developments are cause for cautious optimism. Vigilant monitoring will be necessary to insure continued compliance, and, of course, sanctions can be reapplied if necessary.Critics point out that once it gets what it wants, Tehran will be free to resume its nuclear program. They may be right, but even military experts admit that the agreement will probably delay Iran's nuclear program longer than would airstrikes, which would disrupt but not destroy it and which could harden Iranian resolve to produce a bomb. Neither sanctions nor sabotage, both of which have been employed, have done more than temporarily delay the project. This deal may not be perfect, but it is probably the best that could be achieved under the circumstances. Those opposed to it have yet to come up with an effective, viable alternative. Like it or not, the West must engage Iran if it wants to stabilize the Middle East. Tehran supports Baghdad and the Assad regime in their struggle with ISIS. It also backs the Houthis in the Yemeni civil war, which many observers consider a proxy struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Washington does not of course like all of these actions by Iran, but it cannot wish them away or counter them with purely military action. The nuclear deal may not lead to resolution of these and other issues dividing the two countries, but without such an agreement no discussion of them will occur at all. The U.S. needs a negotiating partner not an adversary."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called for the resignation of Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) on Saturday for the state's lead in the Flint water supply crisis.In 2014, the state switched the city's water source to the Flint River to save money and residents began to complain about the quality of tap water. Michigan officials insisted it was safe to drink, even though an internal memo at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services warned that lead poisoning rates were higher than usual for children under 16. The state continued to say the water was safe until a Flint pediatrician reported in September that there was an unusually high level of lead in Flint children. Lead is an extremely dangerous neurotoxin and can cause children to suffer brain damage.Snyder has apologized for the incident, activated the national guard, called for President Barack Obama to declare an emergency and accepted the resignation of the head of the state's Department of Environmental Quality. Obama declared an emergency on Saturday.But Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, said on Saturday that an apology wasn't enough.“There are no excuses. The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint’s water. He did nothing. As a result, hundreds of children were poisoned. Thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead. Gov. Snyder should resign,” he said in a statement. ""Because of the conduct by Gov. Snyder’s administration and his refusal to take responsibility, families will suffer from lead poisoning for the rest of their lives. Children in Flint will be plagued with brain damage and other health problems. The people of Flint deserve more than an apology.""Sanders' main rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, has also called for an explanation of what Snyder's administration knew and said that the situation was ""unconscionable."" The former Secretary of State has also called on Michigan to pay for water purchases from Detroit for Flint residents until their water is safe again. Clinton also sent Amanda Renteria, her national political director, and Mike Schmidt, a policy adviser, to Flint this week to meet with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver about the situation.David Murray, a Snyder spokesman, said that the governor didn't become aware of the blood lead issue until October 1 and that Sanders' demands didn't contribute to solving the water issue now.""The best thing for the people of Flint is that every effort is focused on solving this emergency, getting the aid needed to help the residents, and ensuring that clean drinkable water is restored to the city,"" he said in a statement. ""Political statements, and finger pointing from political candidates not involved in finding solutions for Flint, only serve to distract from solving this crisis.""Also on HuffPost:"

But lawmakers took little notice until the drug soaked into higher-income, predominately white, rural communities, causing problems that included bursting prison populations. House and Senate Republicans held a retreat this week in Baltimore -- a city considered the heroin capital of the U.S. as recently as last year -- with rudimentary talks on how to address the two issues, possibly together. Only when prompted did they mention the city they chose for their retreat, or its problems.“Baltimore is not the only place there’s a problem,” Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said as he rushed to catch a cab for the airport. He noted that he and Dr. Tom Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had a roundtable discussion in Knoxville, Tennessee, about prescription drug abuse. ""It’s the avenue to heroin addiction, so this is a national problem not just a Baltimore problem.”Heroin began pulsing through Baltimore in the 1950s, but was “relegated to people of lower-income status,” said Thomas Carr, executive director of the Washington/Baltimore High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area -- a program that grants special federal assistance to local and state efforts. But more people are paying attention to addiction now because, as Alexander mentioned, it has spread beyond cities. The epidemic has hit wealthier communities and engulfed states like Tennessee and New Hampshire in the last three to five years. There is no ignoring it. On the presidential campaign trail, New Hampshire is using its status as the first-in-the-nation primary state to get 2016 presidential candidates to talk about it. “Oh, it’s changed,” Carr said. “The use of prescription opioids in the white middle class has driven a lot of people to turn to heroin for their addiction.” It’s now a “rural drug,” he added. A bill in the Senate co-sponsored by Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) would put money toward fighting the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, including expanding prevention and education efforts, and making the overdose treatment drug naloxone more readily available. While Republicans met at the Marriott Waterfront in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor to discuss their agenda for the year -- primarily touting it as one that would be filled with bold ideas -- White House Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough told reporters back in Washington that the heroin epidemic “can, and should, feed the criminal justice reform effort.""Alexander agreed, saying “there is” an opportunity to connect the two. “And fortunately, the Congress is going to be dealing with criminal justice reform early on this year,” Alexander continued. “It’s important to the president, it’s important to us, and when you have that kind of convergence, things often happen.”Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) said talk of criminal justice reform was “in the air” during the retreat. Aside from vows to funnel 12 appropriations bills through Congress this year, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Republican leaders communicated with members that they are “going to look for areas we can work with the administration on” in President Barack Obama’s last year. Criminal justice legislation is a main one, Cornyn said, bringing up the topic unsolicited during a sit-down with reporters. In the Senate, that includes legislation that would allow sentences for low-level drug offenders to be revisited, and give qualifying inmates a chance to get time shaved off their punishment. Similar legislation in the House also targets harsh sentencing laws, and seeks to significantly reduce the prison population. Cornyn said he and Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), an author of the House bill, talked during the retreat to hash out disparities between what Republicans in each chamber want to see in the bill.Cornyn said he also sees potential for the measure to include language addressing the heroin problem that's hurting a growing number of states. “It’s pretty easy for me to see that if the majority leader were to bring the criminal justice reform bill to the floor with an open amendment process, we may well have amendments that deal with mental health reform, some of these issues that’s intersection of the criminal justice system, and some of the problems relating to heroin abuse,” Cornyn said.A remaining issue is how much priority the chambers' leaders -- Senate Majority Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) -- are willing to give to such legislation, and whether they will put it on the floor before Congress by July, when congressional activity dims for the presidential election. “Speaker Ryan personally believes that we should take a hard look at reforming our criminal justice system, but ultimately, it will be up to the conference to decide the path forward,” Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in an email. As for McConnell’s willingness, Cornyn said he expects the Senate to move on it “as soon as possible.”“We’re having this final discussion, trying to work out the differences so we can assure Sen. McConnell that there’s broad bipartisan support and by and large consensus on our own party,” Cornyn said."

I was amazed at how big it is, how big it looks. It looks like a summer movie, and it’s an hour of television,"" Duchovny says. He adds, ""I think we went from being a smallish scary show in the first couple years to being a huge production of science fiction, thriller show, and I think we’re still in that mode. I think the show looks like a movie.""Duchovny opened up to HuffPost about what he's most excited for in the miniseries, the possibility of returning for more episodes and even his pretty convincing theory about why aliens anally probe people.What were you most excited to do with these new episodes?It’s an interesting challenge, and I think a very rare one, for an actor to take a character into his third decade of existence, so that’s something special we’re able to do. Gillian and I, we were very green when we started, and we're just able to do more stuff now. I think we’re much better at what we do.There were all these stories that you cried when you saw the first script. Then some said you didn't. What actually happened?You know, I wish I had never said that. I don't know why me crying is so interesting to people. It had nothing to do with what was written in the script. It had nothing to do with anything like that. It was just seeing ""Mulder"" and ""Scully"" and the words underneath those names, and the fact that I was looking at an ""X-Files"" script, and I hadn't seen one in five or six years, and it was just such a big part of all of our lives, and it was nostalgic and emotional.In a Reddit AMA, you had an interesting theory on why aliens anally probe people. Can you explain that?I said it was like ""Ship of Fools,"" and that alien civilizations had rounded up their abhorrent sexual offenders and dentists and put them all on ships and tried to send them as far away from themselves as they could, to the farthest reaches of their galaxies. Those are the spaceships that happen to circle our planet, so when they abduct us, they tend to focus on those areas.Makes sense. If you did meet aliens from another planet in real life, what would you say?I don’t know [laugh]. Gillian [Anderson] is sitting right here.[To Gillian] What if you met aliens? What would be the first thing you'd say to them?[To HuffPost] ""Would you like some clothes?"" She would give the coat off her back to an alien. [Laugh] That's awesome.That’s very beautiful.What are the chances we get more ""X-Files"" after the miniseries?I think all of us are open, within reason, to doing more, but it also had to do with scheduling. It was very hard to get everybody together for these six. Everybody's got lives, careers, families. We all live in different cities. It was tough. It took a good year and a half, two years to make this happen. We all love working together, and I know if there’s an opportunity and a window and a desire, I'm sure we’ll try to make that work. I'm certainly not against that in any way.Image: Tumblr ""The X-Files"" invades Fox on Sunday, Jan. 24.Also on HuffPost:"

""It is outrageous that he has been used as a bargaining chip.""The Committee to Protect Journalists also welcomed Rezaian's release, but similarly stated he ""should never have been imprisoned in the first place.""""The farce of a judicial process that kept him in custody for 544 days has earned Tehran nothing but scorn from the international community,"" Sherif Mansour, CPJ's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator, said in a statement. ""The Iranian government should begin taking steps immediately to improve its press freedom record by releasing all journalists imprisoned in relation to their work.""Rezaian, who holds dual American and Iranian citizenship, was arrested in July 2014 under nebulous circumstances and jailed with little access to legal representation. He was convicted in October on baseless espionage and propaganda charges.Washington Post editors worked tirelessly for Rezaian's release over the past 14 months, and journalists closely monitored his situation. Last week, 25 top editors and media executives from outlets like The New York Times, The Associated Press and CNN urged Secretary of State John Kerry to press Iran for his release. “Journalism is not a crime,” they told Kerry in a letter. On Saturday, journalists rejoiced at the news that Rezaian would soon be coming home. ""I think everyone in this profession is so happy for him, and his family, and his colleagues that he's free, and remain outraged that he was ever imprisoned,"" BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith, who signed the letter to Kerry, told The Huffington Post. ""The Washington Post and [editor] Marty Baron did the right thing by making sure nobody forgot about him for a minute.""""Jason should have never been imprisoned for doing his job. It is good the Iranians finally realized that. I wish him a safe trip home. And all of us are relieved,"" New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet told HuffPost.New Yorker Editor-in-Chief David Remnick said he was “delighted” to hear the news, which he called an “unbelievable relief.” “There are few things worse for an editor than having someone out in the world you can’t contact and can’t protect,” he said. Both Remnick and Baquet also signed the letter to Kerry.CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour said on air that Rezaian's release was ""something that should have happened a long time ago -- an innocent reporter being held should have been released a long time ago""Amanpour said Rezaian's release was ""absolutely 100 percent connected to implementation day,"" a reference to sanctions being dropped Saturday as part of a nuclear deal with Iran.Many other journalists applauded the news -- and The Washington Post's handling of the ordeal -- on Twitter:Read more on the exchange here:"

In the new version, Granny has plenty of time to slowly back up and grab her shotgun, but the NRA doesn’t explore what would happen if the Big Bad Wolf showed up at the door wielding a firearm himself. (And before you say wolves can’t shoot or obtain guns, this is a wolf who can speak perfect English and semi-convincingly impersonate a human, so in this fantasy NRA world there’s no reason to believe he wouldn’t be able to get his paws on a firearm.)Many were quick to point out that Little Red Riding Hood is far from the only fairytale that could have ended WILDLY differently if more guns had been involved. Using the hashtag #NRAFairyTales, people explored the many possibilities on Twitter.We won’t hold our breath for the NRA Family website to run those versions. Also on HuffPost:"
20,POLITICS,These Are The 4 Americans Iran Just Released,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americans-released-iran_us_5696ca60e4b0ce4964232a8a,The U.S. is set to release seven Iranians in exchange.,2016-01-16,Sarah Hekmati testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in June about her brother's continued imprisonment. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5698024a1f00002300215eb8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Iran freed four Americans as part of a prisoner release deal with the U.S. on Saturday. The men had been imprisoned in the country on trumped up charges, or in some cases no charges at all. The identities of three of the Americans were already known: Washington Post Tehran correspondent Jason Rezaian, former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini. The imprisonment of Nosratollah Khosrawi-Roodsari, the fourth man released Saturday, had not been previously reported.These are Rezaian, Hekmati and Abedini's stories:Jason Rezaian, Washington Post Tehran bureau chiefRezaian was arrested and imprisoned after Iranian authorities raided his and his wife's home in Tehran on July 22, 2014. The 39-year-old California native was charged the following April with four crimes, including espionage, “propaganda against the establishment” and “collaborating with hostile governments” -- the latter charge likely a reference to the U.S. He went to trial behind closed doors in May 2015, and was convicted in October.“To this day, we don’t know what he was sentenced to or what he was convicted of,” Ali Rezaian, Jason’s brother, told The Huffington Post. The Washington Post editorial board slammed the charges as baseless, and accused the Iranian government of subjecting the reporter to “cruel and arbitrary” treatment. Weeks before his arrest, Rezaian had lunch with travel journalist Anthony Bourdain, who was filming an episode of “Parts Unknown” in Iran, and described his love for the country. (Rezaian pictured above with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and Anthony Bourdain. Salehi, also a reporter, was originally detained with Rezaian, but was later released on bail.)In his writing, Rezaian, who has lived in Iran since 2008, often tried to explain misconceptions about Iranian politics and culture to an American readership. In 2013, shortly after Hassan Rouhani, a political moderate, became president, Rezaian wrote about the tension within Iran over chanting “Death to America.” In 2014, Rezaian profiled Iran’s national baseball team, which despite a lack of funding, national recognition or even access to baseball bats due to international sanctions, is ranked 48th worldwide in a sport that is widely regarded as an American pastime. After Islamic State fighters stormed Mosul and spread throughout Iraq and Syria, Rezaian explored the possibilities of tacit cooperation between Iran and the U.S., which had both deployed military force to fight the group. Rezaian, who began covering Iran for the Washington Post in 2012, chronicled months of nuclear negotiations between Iran, the U.S. and five world powers. On July 18, 2014, he published the last story he would write before his arrest, reporting from Vienna that the six states had agreed to another extension of the talks. ""Analysts agree that there is an unprecedented show of will from both sides to complete a deal,"" he wrote at the time. When the talks finally led to a breakthrough agreement almost exactly one year later, Rezaian would learn about it from his jail cell.Rezaian was on friendly terms with Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who told NPR last year that Rezaian is a “fair reporter” and publicly expressed hope that he would be cleared of all charges. Zarif’s public display of compassion for Rezaian, contrasted with the government’s refusal to unilaterally release him, highlights the deep rift between the moderates in the country and the hardliners who are fearful of thawing relations between the U.S. and Iran. On Christmas Day, Iranian officials granted Rezaian’s mother and his wife an unusually long visit of four hours. “We welcome this act of basic humanity, and we encourage his jailers in Iran to follow up by doing all that justice and decency require: Release Jason from prison and allow him a return to life as a free man who can spend time with his family where and whenever he pleases,” Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said of the visit. Rezaian took his first trip to Iran in 2000, shortly after graduating from college. He could not legally enter the country with his American passport, so he opted to get an Iranian passport and become a dual citizen.Because of his status as a highly regarded reporter, Rezaian’s imprisonment has been the most high-profile of the four Americans released in the prisoner swap. Last month, the National Press Club hosted an event marking the 500th day of Rezaian’s detention, in which participants spent 24 hours reading his stories aloud.In commemoration of his brother's 500th day in prison, Ali Rezaian traveled to the United Nations in New York to hand-deliver to the Iranian mission to the U.N. a thumb drive with the names of 535,000 people calling for Rezaian’s immediate release. Ali told HuffPost that the Iranian mission in New York has rejected multiple requests from him to meet with Iran’s U.N. ambassador, Gholamali Khoshroo.On Tuesday, Ali attended President Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address as a guest of Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), the Rezaians’ representative. Huffman feels it’s his job to make sure the public outrage over Rezaian’s detention doesn’t fade. “We’ve just got to keep telling that story,” he told HuffPost days before Rezaian's release. Amir Hekmati, former U.S. MarineAmir Hekmati, who was imprisoned the longest of the four, was arrested in August 2011 when he traveled to Iran for the first time to visit family. The former U.S. Marine was originally charged in a closed-door hearing with spying for the CIA and sentenced to death. His sentence was later overturned, and he was in prison awaiting a retrial before he was released.A year and a half ago, Hekmati was granted daily phone calls of five to 10 minutes, most of which he uses to call his mother. “To hear his voice is helpful, but to also know that he’s going to call tomorrow and we’re not going to have anything different to tell him than we did today is very emotionally draining,” Sarah Hekmati, Amir’s sister, told HuffPost on Tuesday, just before her brother was released in the exchange.Through these phone conversations, Hekmati’s family has learned that he has never had physical access to his attorney in Iran and is suffering from malnourishment. Late last year, he was briefly hospitalized for an infection. Hekmati, who is fluent in Farsi and Arabic, served in the Marines from 2001 to 2005 as a linguist and cultural adviser, with a stint in Iraq. After leaving the military, he founded a consulting company called Lucid Linguistics LLC, and provided translation services to the military on a contract basis. In 2008, he was listed as one of several people who worked on a study of two-way translation systems financed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the wing of the Pentagon responsible for developing new technology. The following year, Hekmati worked with the New York-based company Kuma Games to secure a contract with the military to develop language training for soldiers deployed abroad. Kuma Games, which specializes in realistic, military-style scenarios, developed a game in 2005 called “Assault on Iran,” in which the player had to locate and destroy a nuclear facility in Iran. Although Hekmati had no connection to the “Assault on Iran” game, his past work with Kuma Games and his extensive military background, both as a soldier and later as a civilian contractor, likely sparked the suspicion of Iranian officials. In 2011, Hekmati arranged his first visit to Iran, where he planned to visit his grandmother before returning home to start graduate school at the University of Michigan in the fall. Before he left, his mother told him to seek assurances that his military background wouldn’t “raise red flags” in Iran, his sister said. Hekmati reassured his family that he was very transparent when he applied for a visa through the Iranian interests section in the U.S. and was told it would not be an issue. But before granting him a visa, officials at the Iranian interests section told Hekmati, who at the time did not have Iranian citizenship, that he would have to become a dual national to travel to Iran. “It was almost as if either you become a dual national or you don’t get to visit you grandmother,” Dr. Ramy Kurdi, Hekmati’s brother-in-law, told HuffPost. Two weeks into his visit, Hekmati was arrested by Iranian intelligence officials. In December, four months after his arrest, Iranian state television broadcast a video “confession” from Hekmati. In the sensationalistic six-minute clip, Hekmati says he was recruited by the CIA to infiltrate the Iranian intelligence community as a double agent.In September 2013, Hekmati penned a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, stating that he was being held on false charges based on a confession “obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions, and prolonged periods of solitary confinement.” Hekmati wrote in the letter that his court-appointed attorney suggested he could be released in exchange for two Iranians held abroad, but urged Kerry against a prisoner swap. “I had nothing to do with their arrest, committed no crime, and see no reason why the U.S. Government should entertain such a ridiculous proposition. I do not wish to set a precedent for others that may be unlawfully (obtained) for political gain in the future,” he wrote. At the time, the State Department acknowledged receipt of the letter but denied any discussions with Iran over a prisoner exchange. When asked if her brother’s feelings about a prisoner swap had changed after four and a half years of imprisonment, Sarah was torn. ""Amir, for the sake of his own dignity, even now would feel like, 'What am I? A bargaining chip?'"" she told HuffPost on Tuesday, days before the prisoner swap was concluded. “However, we reiterate to President Obama that as a family, we want every measure taken -- everything that’s at his disposal to be considered.""“Justice will never be served for Amir. So to have a just release, to have it under his ideal conditions -- I mean we’re not even considering that, we just want him home,” added Dr. Kurdi, Hekmati's brother-in-law. “He’s very proud, but he wants to get on the plane more than we want him on that plane, and that’s a lot.”Saeed Abedini, Christian pastor Abedini was arrested in Iran on Sept. 26, 2012, during what was intended to be a short trip from his home in Boise, Idaho, to Iran to visit family and work on an orphanage he was building in Rasht. Abedini is an unusual case: He fled Iran to avoid persecution, returned to visit family and continue Christian outreach, left again after signing an agreement to stop evangelizing in Iran, and returned nine more times before finally getting arrested again.Born in Iran and raised Muslim, Abedini converted to Christianity in 2000 when he was 20 years old. His wife, Naghmeh, told Fox News that he converted after a ""radical Muslim group"" recruited him and he underwent training to become a suicide bomber, then became depressed.After converting, Abedini became active in Iran’s “house church” movement. Although the Iranian constitution recognizes Christianity as a minority religion, Christians, especially Muslim converts to Christianity, have faced persecution from the post-revolutionary government in Iran, making it safer for Christians to worship in underground communities. At the time of his arrest, Fox News reported that Abedini's home church movement had established 100 churches in 30 Iranian cities, with over 2,000 members.Abedini and his wife fled to the U.S. after conservative Iranian politician Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president in 2005. Abedini became involved with a church in Boise and later became a U.S. citizen, making him a dual Iranian-American national.In 2009, Abedini took his wife and two children to Iran for his first visit back. On their way home, Iranian authorities stopped Abedini and detained and interrogated him. According to his U.S.-based attorneys, Abedini signed a written agreement with the government to abstain from participation in the house church movement in exchange for his release and the freedom to continue visiting Iran.Between 2009 and 2012, Abedini visited Iran nine times before he was arrested. Attorneys from the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative Christian organization based in Washington, took on Abedini’s case and maintain that he abided by his agreement with the government, limiting his work in Iran to humanitarian relief.Abedini was initially placed under house arrest in July 2012, and later transferred to Evin prison, the notorious facility where Rezaian and Hekmati are held. The following January, he was sentenced to eight years in prison. ACLJ attorneys say the case centered around charges against him from 2000, the year he converted to Christianity. In November 2013, Abedini was transferred from Evin, which is known to hold political prisoners, to Rajai Shahr, a prison with an even worse human rights reputation.Until recently, Naghmeh campaigned aggressively for her husband’s release. She has over 50,000 followers on Facebook and 10,000 on Twitter, where she writes about scripture, prayer and fasting, and until recently, updated her followers about Abedini.In November, Christianity Today reported that Naghmeh emailed supporters describing problems in her marriage, including “physical, emotional, psychological, and sexual abuse (through Saeed’s addiction to pornography).” Although she has not retracted those claims, she later said she regretted sending the emails. “I was under great psychological and emotional distress. I am now taking time off to heal and to rest and to spend much needed time with my kids,” she said in a statement through ACLJ. Not released: Robert Levinson, off-the-books CIA contractorA retired FBI agent, Levinson disappeared in Iran in March 2007, while there on unofficial business with the CIA. He flew from Dubai to the Iranian Kish Island on March 8, where he was investigating the murder of an Iranian dissident in Maryland. He checked out of his hotel the next morning, and was never seen again.U.S. government officials have said they believe Levinson is being held by a group tied to Iran’s religious leaders, but the Iranian government claims they have no information about his whereabouts.In Congressional testimony, the agency denied any affiliation with Levinson, but in 2013, the Washington Post reported that in a violation of policy, a CIA analyst had encouraged Levinson to travel to Iran. Ten employees were disciplined in relation to Levinson’s disappearance, including three who were pushed out of their jobs.In 2010, Levinson’s family received a videotape of him, begging the U.S. government to respond to the demands of “the group that has held me for three and a half years.” The following year, the family received photos of Levinson shackled and wearing an orange jumpsuit, likely meant to imitate the clothes worn by Guantanamo Bay detainees.Last March, on the eighth anniversary of Levinson’s disappearance and the eve of his 67th birthday, the FBI raised its reward for information about his case to $5 million.Privately, government officials have expressed doubt that Levinson, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, gout and hypertension, is still alive.Levinson joined the FBI in 1978 and retired 20 years later, transitioning into work as a private investigator. By at least 2006, he was doing contract work for the CIA. The Washington Post reported that he provided the agency with information about rebels in Colombia, former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Iran’s nuclear program.Senior administration officials told HuffPost that Levinson was not considered as part of the prisoner swap, but that they hope more information about his post-2007 activity will come to light as a result of the new diplomatic channel between the U.S. and Iran.Read more on the exchange here:"

At the time, the State Department acknowledged receipt of the letter but denied any discussions with Iran over a prisoner exchange. When asked if her brother’s feelings about a prisoner swap had changed after four and a half years of imprisonment, Sarah was torn. ""Amir, for the sake of his own dignity, even now would feel like, 'What am I? A bargaining chip?'"" she told HuffPost on Tuesday, days before the prisoner swap was concluded. “However, we reiterate to President Obama that as a family, we want every measure taken -- everything that’s at his disposal to be considered.""“Justice will never be served for Amir. So to have a just release, to have it under his ideal conditions -- I mean we’re not even considering that, we just want him home,” added Dr. Kurdi, Hekmati's brother-in-law. “He’s very proud, but he wants to get on the plane more than we want him on that plane, and that’s a lot.”Saeed Abedini, Christian pastor Abedini was arrested in Iran on Sept. 26, 2012, during what was intended to be a short trip from his home in Boise, Idaho, to Iran to visit family and work on an orphanage he was building in Rasht. Abedini is an unusual case: He fled Iran to avoid persecution, returned to visit family and continue Christian outreach, left again after signing an agreement to stop evangelizing in Iran, and returned nine more times before finally getting arrested again.Born in Iran and raised Muslim, Abedini converted to Christianity in 2000 when he was 20 years old. His wife, Naghmeh, told Fox News that he converted after a ""radical Muslim group"" recruited him and he underwent training to become a suicide bomber, then became depressed.After converting, Abedini became active in Iran’s “house church” movement. Although the Iranian constitution recognizes Christianity as a minority religion, Christians, especially Muslim converts to Christianity, have faced persecution from the post-revolutionary government in Iran, making it safer for Christians to worship in underground communities. At the time of his arrest, Fox News reported that Abedini's home church movement had established 100 churches in 30 Iranian cities, with over 2,000 members.Abedini and his wife fled to the U.S. after conservative Iranian politician Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president in 2005. Abedini became involved with a church in Boise and later became a U.S. citizen, making him a dual Iranian-American national.In 2009, Abedini took his wife and two children to Iran for his first visit back. On their way home, Iranian authorities stopped Abedini and detained and interrogated him. According to his U.S.-based attorneys, Abedini signed a written agreement with the government to abstain from participation in the house church movement in exchange for his release and the freedom to continue visiting Iran.Between 2009 and 2012, Abedini visited Iran nine times before he was arrested. Attorneys from the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative Christian organization based in Washington, took on Abedini’s case and maintain that he abided by his agreement with the government, limiting his work in Iran to humanitarian relief.Abedini was initially placed under house arrest in July 2012, and later transferred to Evin prison, the notorious facility where Rezaian and Hekmati are held. The following January, he was sentenced to eight years in prison. ACLJ attorneys say the case centered around charges against him from 2000, the year he converted to Christianity. In November 2013, Abedini was transferred from Evin, which is known to hold political prisoners, to Rajai Shahr, a prison with an even worse human rights reputation.Until recently, Naghmeh campaigned aggressively for her husband’s release. She has over 50,000 followers on Facebook and 10,000 on Twitter, where she writes about scripture, prayer and fasting, and until recently, updated her followers about Abedini.In November, Christianity Today reported that Naghmeh emailed supporters describing problems in her marriage, including “physical, emotional, psychological, and sexual abuse (through Saeed’s addiction to pornography).” Although she has not retracted those claims, she later said she regretted sending the emails. “I was under great psychological and emotional distress. I am now taking time off to heal and to rest and to spend much needed time with my kids,” she said in a statement through ACLJ. Not released: Robert Levinson, off-the-books CIA contractorA retired FBI agent, Levinson disappeared in Iran in March 2007, while there on unofficial business with the CIA. He flew from Dubai to the Iranian Kish Island on March 8, where he was investigating the murder of an Iranian dissident in Maryland. He checked out of his hotel the next morning, and was never seen again.U.S. government officials have said they believe Levinson is being held by a group tied to Iran’s religious leaders, but the Iranian government claims they have no information about his whereabouts.In Congressional testimony, the agency denied any affiliation with Levinson, but in 2013, the Washington Post reported that in a violation of policy, a CIA analyst had encouraged Levinson to travel to Iran. Ten employees were disciplined in relation to Levinson’s disappearance, including three who were pushed out of their jobs.In 2010, Levinson’s family received a videotape of him, begging the U.S. government to respond to the demands of “the group that has held me for three and a half years.” The following year, the family received photos of Levinson shackled and wearing an orange jumpsuit, likely meant to imitate the clothes worn by Guantanamo Bay detainees.Last March, on the eighth anniversary of Levinson’s disappearance and the eve of his 67th birthday, the FBI raised its reward for information about his case to $5 million.Privately, government officials have expressed doubt that Levinson, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, gout and hypertension, is still alive.Levinson joined the FBI in 1978 and retired 20 years later, transitioning into work as a private investigator. By at least 2006, he was doing contract work for the CIA. The Washington Post reported that he provided the agency with information about rebels in Colombia, former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Iran’s nuclear program.Senior administration officials told HuffPost that Levinson was not considered as part of the prisoner swap, but that they hope more information about his post-2007 activity will come to light as a result of the new diplomatic channel between the U.S. and Iran.Read more on the exchange here:"

23,THE WORLDPOST,Africa's Success Story?,"John Feffer, ContributorDirector, Foreign Policy In Focus; Author, 'Aftershock: A Jour...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/africas-success-story_us_569a9788e4b04f0466867f38,"The most impressive person I met in Botswana barely said a word. She was an older woman, small in stature. We were sitting",2016-01-16,"Workers check, cut and polish diamonds at a Diamond cutting and polishing company during the tour by Ghanian President John Dramani Mahama in Gaborone, on March 11, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569d50ca1a00002d00ab0cc1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The most impressive person I met in Botswana barely said a word.She was an older woman, small in stature. We were sitting next to each other at a table during lunch at a conference about Botswana’s economic model. In a quiet voice, she told me that she was a former government minister. We talked briefly about the conference, neither of us saying anything particularly memorable. Then we were both drawn away by other conversations.I learned later that Gaositwe Chiepe was the first woman to serve as a government minister in Botswana, the large but sparsely populated country just to the north of South Africa and sandwiched between Namibia and Zimbabwe. Chiepe had served in a number of capacities, including foreign minister, over five decades of civil service. Now retired and in her late 80s, she was still attending public functions. She’d come not as a speaker, but only to listen, and she had no glitzy entourage.Later, when I was trying to figure out why Botswana was an African success story, I realized that I’d already encountered the answer — in the person of Gaositwe Chiepe.Since securing its independence in 1966, Botswana vaulted from one of the poorest countries on the continent to one of the richest. From 1966 to 2014, its economy was the third fastest growing in the world — by per capita GDP — after China and South Korea. During that time, it has achieved an adult literacy rate of 85 percent, and nearly 90 percent of children are enrolled in primary school. It’s one of the few countries in Africa with a stable democracy where the elected leaders have served their terms and then stepped down, instead of resorting to coups or constitutional changes to maintain power.There’s no question that Botswana has been lucky. A year after independence, some of the richest diamond mines in the world were found there. But many countries in Africa have been blessed with comparable riches — Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola — and have experienced war, dictatorship, rampant corruption, and little else. The reason why Botswana has largely escaped the “resource curse” has something to do with luck, but much more to do with people like Gaositwe Chiepe. She’s a member of the 3H generation — hard-working, honest, and humble — a cadre of public servants who ensured that the country would succeed where so many others have not.But the Botswanan economy remains dependent on its diamond wealth. A fifth of the population lives below the poverty line, and roughly one out of every three young people is unemployed. An uptick in corruption and political turmoil has begun to roil the traditionally placid society. The country needs another miracle to somehow get to the next level of prosperity. But who or what will supply that miracle?Diamond FlushThe Jwaneng mine is the richest producer of diamonds in the world. It’s located a couple hours west of the Botswanan capital of Gaborone, and it’s surrounded on several sides by a game park. The mine itself doesn’t look like much, of course — just a huge gash in the ground, ringed by heaps of earth displaced by the diggers and the trucks. It’s a barren landscape, largely devoid of vegetation. The guide driving us around the pit mentions that baboons occasionally scamper into the area. We don’t see any animal life. It might as well be the moon.At the bottom of the pit is the top of the “pipe,” a natural shaft that goes deep into the earth’s crust and through which the gems have been brought up close to the surface by past volcanic activity. Debswana — the joint venture between the De Beers diamond company and the Botswana government — is now preparing for what it calls Cut-8. Each “cut” is a wider-angle slice into the pit in order to reach deeper into the pipe and extract more diamonds. Cut-8 is expected to extend the life of the mine until 2025, providing $28 billion to the Botswana economy and more than 1,000 jobs.I’m with a group of journalists invited by De Beers to tour its facilities and attend a conference co-sponsored with Chatham House. In addition to the mine, they take us to a school and a health clinic for the workers and their families — a community of around 30,000 people. Everything is spotless.I’ve no reason to believe that Jwaneng is a Potemkin Village. Most Botswanan miners are unionized, and the jobs are coveted. De Beers took the lead in subsidizing antiretroviral treatments for its employees. None of this is charity, exactly. De Beers relies on a well functioning and highly trained workforce in a country of only two million people. It can’t afford to be cavalier about its workforce.Also, De Beers doesn’t have an adversarial relationship with the Botswanan government. Instead of nationalizing the fledgling diamond industry in the 1960s or handing it over completely to De Beers, the government established a public-private partnership with the company. The government gets a large cut of the profits as well as a decision-making role on the corporation’s board. In exchange, De Beers operates in a stable and secure environment.The latest twist in this partnership is “beneficiation,” a process by which Botswana extracts more value from each diamond mined on its territory as well as some of the diamonds mined elsewhere in the De Beers empire. As I write this week in Foreign Policy:The plan turned the global diamond industry upside down. In the past, buyers traveled to London to view the rough gems that De Beers had mined from operations in 28 countries. But for the past two years, as a part of the beneficiation process, these buyers have gone to the other side of the globe, visiting the capital of Botswana to buy an annual $6 billion worth of diamonds.Botswana was dealt a pretty good hand in 1967, and it has played its cards well. But the market for diamonds, like all commodities these days, is volatile. Even with Cut-8 and beneficiation, Botswana needs to diversify its economy. Diamonds contribute around 30 percent of GDP and 75 percent of export revenues. Botswana has some other potentially valuable commodities under ground, such as coal and copper. But diversification will require a move away from extractive industries altogether.But the real challenge may well be political. Botswana is a democracy, but along the lines of Japan, where a single party has been in power for decades. This status quo is changing. Given some of the country’s current problems, it could perhaps use a little shaking up.Mounting OppositionIn the run-up to parliamentary elections last year, opposition politician Gomolemo Motswaledi died in a car accident. The opposition Botswana Movement for Democracy (BMD), of which Motswaledi was the leader, immediately alleged government involvement in what they speculated was a politically motivated murder. The full report on the investigation into the incident has yet to be released.If the incident had been unique, perhaps the public would have accepted the government’s explanation. But a number of people have died recently in unusual circumstances. In 2010, the body of former Debswana Managing Director Louis Goodwill Nchindo was found in a rural area, a month before he was to appear in court on corruption charges. There were rumors that he had secrets to tell about powerful people in Botswana, including the De Beers founding family, the Oppenheimers. Government security forces were implicated in the 2009 murder of businessman John Kalafatis and the attempted killing of his brother Costa four years later. President Ian Khama stepped in to pardon the guilty and allow them to return to their positions.Botswana has a high reputation for transparency — it has the best ranking in all of Africa in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions index — but a great deal of mystery surrounds these cases. There’s also considerable controversy around the relocation of 3,000 San (also known as Bushmen), the indigenous nomadic people, from their ancestral homelands in the Kalahari Desert between 1997 and 2002. Two hundred San brought a case against the government, and the Supreme Court ruled in their favor. But the government has interpreted the ruling to apply only to the 200 litigants. Critics suspect that the relocation had something to do with gaining access to the mineral wealth lying beneath those lands.Getting more information about these cases is not made easier by the fact that Botswana lacks a freedom of information act (the ruling party has twice rejected a proposed bill). Another problem is that the government has been leaning more heavily on the press — particularly last year around the elections, when it withdrew advertising from media noted for their unflattering coverage of the ruling party.Some of the interventions were more sinister. Journalist Edgar Tsimane, for instance, had published quite a few critical articles about the government. But a piece he published in September 2014 must have really rubbed someone the wrong way because he received warnings from informants that his life was in danger. He fled over the border to South Africa, where sought and received asylum.As it turned out, the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) won a parliamentary majority in the 2014 elections. But it had good reason to worry about its popularity: It actually lost the popular vote and only maintained its grip on power because of the intricacies of the country’sfirst-past-the-poll system.“We are seeing a shift now,” investigative journalist Alvin Ntibinyane told me. “The ruling party is no longer popular, and people are saying maybe the country’s hope lies with the opposition. In the last election, the popular vote went to opposition by 52 percent. The ruling party got 47 percent. That signals something for the ruling party. For the 2019 elections, it’s likely that for the first time in history, the ruling party will lose the elections. The question is: How will they handle this?”Tshireletso Motlogelwa, publisher of Botswana’s Business Weekly and Review, agrees. “The ruling party is now consigned to the outskirts of the urban areas and the rural areas, and the tribal areas where the president comes from,” he observed. “BDP insiders are worried about that. Once you lose the middle class and the influential people in public discourse, it won’t be long before you are losing the election itself.”Critics single out President Khama for particular scrutiny. “He comes from the military,” Motlogelwa continued. “He also comes from the ruling family. He has a different thinking altogether. Because of his background, he has a certain impatience with engagement. He thinks democracy is a waste of time that holds back development.”“His presidency in his eighth year, and he has never held a press conference,” Ntibinyane added. “He has never addressed the nation, whether on radio or TV, on any issue. His credentials remain a secret. He is still a black box.”The press is trying to push harder to expose corruption at the highest levels. The opposition is mobilizing to end the ruling party’s grip on power. What’s missing from the equation is a vibrant civil society.Tracy Sonny, an environmental activist in Botswana, connects the lack of a strong civil society to the country’s middle-income status. “It’s not that we don’t have issues that need to be addressed,” she told me. “But there’s no drive in people as in other African countries. We as the people are the ones to find solutions to problems, but we just leave everything to government.”For decades, Botswanans could leave everything to government because the government was staffed by people like Gaositwe Chiepe. That era is over. Another miracle could come out of the ground. But it’s more likely that the miracle will come from Botswanans themselves, as they chart a new path that will allow them to claim once again the mantle of Africa’s success story.Crossposted from Foreign Policy In Focus"

The prisoners were freed as part of a prisoner release deal between the U.S. and Iran. The agreement is the result of 14 months of high-stakes secret negotiations between the two traditional adversaries.On Saturday, the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report confirming Iran's compliance with the July 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five world powers -- a move that triggered broad sanctions relief.

Matthew Trevithick, an American student who was held in Iran for 40 days, was also released on Saturday, but not as part of the negotiated agreement between Iran and the U.S. “I’m very happy to say that as we speak, we have received confirmation that five Americans that had been unjustly detained in Iran have been released from custody and should be on their way home to their families before long,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday evening in Vienna. A U.S. official confirmed Sunday morning that the former prisoners who wished to depart Iran had left. Saturday marked a whirlwind of events for Iranian-American diplomacy.After the IAEA issued the report confirming Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal, Kerry signed a waiver lifting congressionally enacted sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program. At the same time, President Barack Obama issued a new executive order to lift sanctions that were enacted under his authority, and the U.N. and EU moved to provide sanctions relief to Iran.Kerry was expected to then fly to the site where the Americans will be released to welcome them. But the plane bearing the released prisoners left Tehran much later than originally planned, and Kerry instead flew back to Washington on a red-eye. The Treasury Department is likely to announce new sanctions against 11 people and entities tied to Iran’s ballistic missile program soon -- just after lifting sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program.Rezaian's mother and wife, who live in Iran, found out about his release in advance and are on the flight out of Tehran. U.S. officials, who say they did not tell the Rezaians the exchange was imminent, had planned to notify all of the families of the prisoners once the plane took off for Tehran -- and after they were certain the agreement wouldn't collapse.The transfer of the American prisoners back into U.S. custody was originally planned to occur in Bern, Switzerland, but may now occur at a different location due to weather concerns.After the transfer, the four Americans will be taken to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, an American military hospital in Germany, for immediate medical treatment before returning home.Another Iranian-American, Siamak Namazi, was not included in the prisoner deal and remains imprisoned in Iran. ""We won't give up"" on Namazi, the administration official said."" Another American, Robert Levinson, disappeared on Iran’s Kish Island in 2007, where he was doing unofficial work for the CIA, but Iranian officials deny having knowledge of his whereabouts. ""The case of Robert Levinson ... was aggressively pursued through this channel and through this process,"" the official said. ""In the end, he did not go into this deal, but we have an arrangement with the Iranians ... and they will continue to seek information about his whereabouts.""Saturday's announcement comes after 14 months of negotiations between American and Iranian diplomats, some of whom were already meeting regularly to negotiate the nuclear deal.The State Department never publicly disclosed the existence of negotiations to free the Americans and publicly rejected calls to tie the prisoners -- or any other issue -- to the nuclear talks. But privately, Brett McGurk, who until recently was deputy secretary of state for Iran and Iraq, led talks focusing on the prisoners.Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, the public faces of the nuclear deal negotiations, also spoke in private about the prisoners. Kerry and Zarif deliberately kept the talks separate from the nuclear negotiations, never raising the two topics in the same meeting, according to a a second senior administration official. Kerry, faced with resistance to the deal at home and in Iran, kept the discussions alive at several critical moments, the second senior official said. McGurk, who is better known for his current role as the U.S. special envoy for the coalition fighting the Islamic State, is also known within the State Department as a skilled negotiator who worked with Iranian officials during his extensive time in Iraq. He was also able to fly under the radar throughout months of negotiations with the Iranians, a feat that would have been more difficult for Kerry.Despite the appearance a ""grand plan,"" the prisoner deal was not tied to the nuclear deal implementation day, the second administration official said.It was the Iranians who first proposed a prisoner swap.The U.S. had complained to Iran about the imprisoned men for years, but the nuclear negotiations finally gave diplomats from the two countries a chance to talk about the problem ""face-to-face,"" the first senior administration official said Saturday. In the beginning, ""Iran asked for a lot of people,"" Kerry told reporters. Diplomats whittled the list down to exclude anyone who was charged with a crime related to violence or terrorism. All of the Iranians who were released were convicted or accused of violating sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program -- which were lifted on Saturday.“This should not be viewed as a precedent that would encourage this kind of behavior in the future, and second, as I said, any Iranian citizen who was engaged in any violent crime or support for terrorist activity would not be considered,” a third senior official said Saturday.Iranian officials have publicly floated the idea of a prisoner exchange, but neither country disclosed the full extent of the negotiations. An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said in August that 19 Iranian nationals were being held in the U.S. on charges of sanctions violations, but another Iranian official denied that Iran was considering a prisoner exchange. President Hassan Rouhani hinted at a prisoner exchange the following month when he was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, reasoning that Iranian sanctions violators should be released since sanctions were due to be lifted as part of the nuclear deal.When the final nuclear accord was announced on July 14, there was no mention of the American prisoners returning home as part of the deal. Even though the Obama administration deliberately avoided tying the prisoners to the nuclear deal, critics of the budding rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran cited the continued imprisonment of the Americans as a key failure of the nuclear negotiations.To Chase Foster, a former State Department official who worked on Iran matters, it was a sign that the Iranians were negotiating in bad faith and taking advantage of American naiveté. “We have to learn to take a stand and argue from a point of strength,” he told HuffPost in November, arguing that the administration should have insisted the American prisoners return home before agreeing to lift sanctions. “But at this point we have nothing to stand on because we’ve been so shallow, spineless, naive, gullible and stupid.” Foster left the State Department last year.U.S. officials’ logic for separating the release of the American prisoners from the nuclear deal is threefold: Tacking on additional topics to an already contentious agreement could have lessened the chances of striking a deal, officials reasoned. If the fate of the American prisoners was tied to a nuclear deal, and that effort failed, it could be even more difficult to bring them home at a later point. And finally, giving concessions on the nuclear agreement in exchange for prisoners would legitimize the practice of taking prisoners, only encouraging Iran to arrest more Americans in the future.But to outside critics, who weren’t privy to the secret prisoner negotiations, the Obama administration had simply abandoned its own citizens who were trapped in Iran.Just a week before the prisoner agreement was announced, Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush said he found it “appalling” that “there’s been no effort to try to support the Americans held hostage by the Iranian government.”Behind the scenes, there was a concerted effort to free the Americans, and it ramped up after the July 14 nuclear deal was finalized. “The feeling was, we got this really big thing done, we have better diplomatic openings -- now we can really focus on the prisoners,” the second administration official told HuffPost.""There’s no question that the pace and progress of the humanitarian talks accelerated in light of the relationships forged and the diplomatic channels unlocked over the course of the nuclear talks,"" Kerry said Saturday.Kerry raised the issue of the American prisoners during the last conversation he had with Zarif before the nuclear deal was announced in July. Zarif seemed receptive, Kerry said. By November, Kerry thought they had reached an agreement to secure the prisoners' release. But it collapsed in Tehran, and the two countries had to resume negotiations. Over the past several months, U.S. officials worked to iron out differences with the Iranians and internal divisions within the U.S. government. Department of Justice officials, who were approaching the situation with a rule-of-law attitude rather than as diplomats working through a delicate compromise, balked at the idea of a prisoner swap.“The Justice Department has had a problem with this the whole time,” said Foster, who was looped in on earlier conversations about the prisoner exchange. “Whoever Iran wants are legitimate criminals … they’re not just people we grabbed off the street so we could have a bargaining chip.”Iranian diplomats faced similar complications at home: Hard-liners in Iranian security forces oppose any cooperation with the U.S., and resisted releasing the Americans. After the July 14 nuclear agreement, which represented a major victory for Rouhani and his moderate camp, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned further negotiations with the Americans. He did, however, allow Iran to join the Syria peace talks, which the U.S. is part of -- an early indication that his ban could be posturing. On the same day the historic nuclear deal was announced in July, the prisoner exchange negotiations faced another complication: Iranian security forces stopped Namazi, the American who is still imprisoned in Iran, at the Tehran airport and seized his passport. They arrested him in October.“They’re not showing fear, that’s for sure,” Foster said of the most recent arrest of an American in Iran. “This sends a strong message -- this is not a regime interested in any form of rapprochement.”Namazi’s October arrest did not collapse the prisoner talks. If anything, the arrest of another American may have added urgency to the negotiations.During the next several months, the Americans and Iranians narrowed in on a final list of prisoners to be exchanged. In the end, the Justice Department agreed to release seven Iranians: three who were serving time in prison and four who were awaiting trial, including one who was in the process of negotiating a plea bargain.The semiofficial Fars News Agency reported the names of the seven Iranians, but the U.S. government has not yet confirmed their identities.There was at least one final hiccup: the sanctions that the U.S. is expected to impose on Iran's ballistic missile program. The Treasury Department originally intended to announce the sanctions on Dec. 30, a Wednesday. But that Tuesday, Dec. 29, Kerry spoke with Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, to notify him. Zarif warned Kerry that the people who would be affected by the sanctions included some of the same people involved in the prisoner negotiations -- and said that announcing the sanctions before the arrangement was complete could blow up the deal.Top Obama administration officials decided to delay the sanctions to save the prisoner exchange talks. The administration paid a political price for that choice. Officials made the decision to delay the sanctions late on Dec. 29. But because of bureaucratic dysfunction, some members of Congress still received a notification on the morning of the Dec. 30 saying the new sanctions would be announced that morning. The White House had to correct that erroneous notification -- several times -- and the next day, on New Year’s Eve, the Wall Street Journal reported the whole saga and revealed that the White House had delayed imposing the new sanctions.Lawmakers from both parties slammed the administration, saying the delay suggested Obama was backtracking on his pledge to hold Iran accountable for its ballistic missile program, as well as the country's support for terrorist groups and human rights abuses -- all considered separate from the nuclear accord.Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who voted in favor of the nuclear deal, publicly questioned the administration’s reasoning and pushed the White House to move forward with the ballistic missile sanctions. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), whose party unanimously opposed the nuclear accord, accused the president of “sweeping these transgressions under the rug” and warned that “key members of [Obama’s] own party are also losing faith in [his] ability to confront Iran.”The president couldn't tell his critics he had delayed the new ballistic missiles sanctions in order to prevent the secret prisoner swap deal from collapsing. Obama and his team had determined that a few more weeks without the new sanctions in place “wouldn’t affect [the Iranian] ballistic missile program,” the second official said. “We calculated that it was worth it.”  Ryan Grim contributed reporting.Read more on the exchange here:This story has been updated to remove Foster’s account of when and under what circumstances he left the State Department.

The prisoners were freed as part of a prisoner release deal between the U.S. and Iran. The agreement is the result of 14 months of high-stakes secret negotiations between the two traditional adversaries.On Saturday, the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report confirming Iran's compliance with the July 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five world powers -- a move that triggered broad sanctions relief. As part of the prisoner exchange, the U.S. is releasing or dropping charges against seven Iranians who were being held in the country on sanctions violations. All were born in Iran, but six are dual Iranian-American citizens. The seven men all have the option to remain in the U.S. The U.S. is also dropping Interpol red notices against 14 Iranians who they assessed were not likely to be extradited to the U.S. regardless.

Presidential debates are more like barroom brawls. The comments sections of most news sites are a cesspool of hatred, name-calling and fear. When President Barack Obama exuberantly calls out, ""Let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all!"" his ""opponents"" seem unable to find even enough goodwill to applaud that. (How one can be opposed to curing cancer is beyond me.)The open-air hostility snaking through the country seems to fly in the face of what America stands for. Or does it? Some would venture that it's actually what Americans do best. Writing for Salon, author Chauncey DeVega said, ""Donald Trump's racism, nativism and bigotry are as American as apple pie.""With that line, the picture DeVega paints is bleak; but unfortunately, it has historical merits. If you consider the annihilation of Native Americans, the enslavement and oppression of African peoples, Japanese internment camps, Jim Crow, redlining, mandatory minimums -- I could go on and on -- it's easy to see where he's going with that sentiment.But when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. marched, preached and toiled during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, he knew the sordid history of this country -- and was deeply mired in its bigoted present -- and yet, he still imagined that things could be different. He saw the ugliness but believed in the beauty. What would Dr. King think about our country today? I think he still would have hope. And here's why:Despite the bad news that permeates about failing schools, underperforming students, unqualified teachers and apathetic communities, education still is working to improve the lives of children across the country. Data from the Council of Great City Schools continues to suggest an upward trending in student test scores in America's largest urban school districts. Additionally, data from the Department of Education indicates graduation rates have reached unprecedented levels -- some 82 percent of students are graduating. Headlines indicate otherwise, but it is true: Education is making a difference.Further, scientific research tells us that an integrated education -- one where students and teachers alike come from varied racial and socio-economic backgrounds -- works even better. In fact, in our work with the West Metro Education Program, a desegregation initiative with Minneapolis Public Schools, the students who were bussed to suburban schools made three times the progress in both reading and math when compared with similar students who were not a part of the bussing program. Desegregated districts such as Eden Prairie, Minn., have reduced the ""achievement gap"" by nearly 60 percent, using culturally responsive strategies, as well as those pedagogies guided by neuroscience. Districts such as Robbinsdale, Minn., and urban schools in districts such as San Francisco, New York City and Bridgeport, Conn., have in elementary grades seen two standard deviations of improvement for their students. The list can go on, suffice it to say, showing that integrated districts, and those who support their educators through sustained professional development, have succeeded at unprecedented levels. The more diverse a school, the higher the achievement. Frankly, the data which continues to emerge hopefully will strip ideology of its influence over public policy. The fact is, isolation and xenophobia work against our collective success. Partnerships, community and togetherness make us all better. Dr. King knew that, which is why integration was a major part of his dream. He longed to see a day when ""little black boys and black girls would be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls -- as sisters and brothers.""We are making progress, but there still are children being left behind.  Too many Black, Brown and poor students still languish in schools where the mosaic of skin tones in classrooms and communities isn't properly celebrated. Too many are judged by their circumstances, not their strengths, and are held back by stereotypes, labels and low expectations. Despite good intentions and academic training, too few teachers understand that the brain is a muscle - wired with everything it needs to be phenomenal, and able to change and grow with exercise and challenge. Sadly, there are those in power who are comfortable ignoring science. There are those who are all too happy to perpetuate myths, stir up fear and leave those children behind. When presidential candidate Donald Trump says, ""Let's make America great again,"" we know exactly what he's really saying: Let's make America white again. For so many reasons, it is imperative that all of us who know better reject that dog-whistle, and actively decry those who would deny the dream to any human -- especially the children. And while we're denouncing Trump and others like him, we need to lift up the power of education. While we're nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan, we should take care not to neglect our resources and treasures here in our own home. We need to invest in education.By educating the teachers on best practice emerging from neuroscience research, focusing on diverse cultures as strengths rather than weaknesses to be ameliorated, changing their beliefs about children's abilities, we counter the worst parts of our nation and keep taking steps beyond our ugly past. By educating the children, we create, over time, a more just and harmonious future. Like Dr. King, I believe in the beauty this nation has to offer. I see it all the time in classrooms from New York to Minneapolis to California.On this, the 87th birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, let's consider ways we can contribute to the growth of students and teachers alike, through education - the most important civil right of our time.Instead of making America great ""again,"" let's do what Dr. King wanted us to do. Let's make our country great right now -- by embracing the diverse cultural, ethnic and racial mosaic of Americans, by focusing on tolerance, empathy and inclusion, and most importantly, providing a hand up for those struggling with poverty: black, white, brown, Asian, Native American.

(Photo by Joshua Lott/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb92cea210000d601c97dca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With polls tightening in advance of the critical Iowa Caucus, media outlets have sat up and taken notice of maverick insurgent candidate Bernie Sanders. With momentum on his side, the independent senator from Vermont might be able to replicate the unstoppable Obama coalition of 2008, yet in certain critical respects Sanders still lags. While Obama was able to attract educated whites, he also garnered significant support from minorities, including the increasingly important Latino bloc.  To date, Bernie has pulled out all the stops in an effort to court Latinos, but many are still unfamiliar with the left-leaning democratic socialist. If he wishes to solidify his support among Latinos, Bernie must broaden his definition of ""political revolution"" in an effort to prove that his candidacy has as much to do with building a popular movement as getting elected to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.Deep Roots When people think about the growing Latino population in the U.S., they typically consider large cities such as New York, Chicago or Los Angeles. Yet in recent years, Latinos have spread out into rural areas such as Iowa. Indeed, from 2000-2014 Latinos grew a whopping 110% in Iowa, and they are projected to represent 13% of the state's population by 2025. Today, Iowa's Latino population, most of whom is Mexican and Mexican-American, numbers some 174,000.  Latinos have deep ties to Iowa as many helped to build the state's original railroad while others migrated to the area in search of farming work. Today, Latinos have helped to revitalize many economically stagnant areas of Iowa, and Des Moines now hosts its own ""Little Mexico"" neighborhood. National Journal remarks that ""in many ways, Latinos saved Iowa."" For many years, the publication notes, young people left Iowa's small towns in droves in search of employment in the big city. Then, the ""Latino revolution"" hit the state, and new arrivals acquired jobs in manufacturing and meatpacking plants. Iowa's Latino Profile Despite such historic trends, Latinos still have a long way to go politically. Even with their growing numbers Latinos still number only 6 percent of the state's overall population. Historically, Latinos have hardly represented a blip on the caucus radar, with fewer than a thousand people participating in the last 2012 contest. Today, 50,000 Latinos are registered to vote in Iowa, most of whom are independents with a third Democrat and a small number of Republicans.  Iowa has a grand total of 2 million voters, though turnout can be low so early in the electoral season with only about 200,000 people generally participating in the caucus. This year, however, organizers hope to increase Latino turnout to some 10,000 for both Republican and Democratic contests. That number would be quite small, though Latinos make up a critical swing vote in some legislative districts. Take, for example, the small meatpacking city of Marshalltown in central Iowa. The town used to be lily-white, but since the 1980s and the expansion of the meatpacking industry, Mexicans have moved in and today the city's population is one quarter Latino. With the polling so close, Sanders must do his utmost to turn out every last Latino to caucus on his behalf. That may be a tough order, since the state's caucus system can be difficult to navigate for newcomers [for more on the mechanics of this process, see a recent report about Iowa Latinos which aired on MSNBC]. Moreover, despite their growing numbers Latinos aren't very politically active at the local level. Currently, there are no Latinos in the state legislature and they hold only a tiny number of elective offices. In some Iowa towns, community meetings are still dominated by white residents. Latinos are not only marginalized politically but also socially. Indeed, the poverty rate afflicting Iowa's Latinos is much higher than that of the rest of the state.Galvanizing Iowa's Latinos Despite such disadvantages, Latinos may be galvanized this year like never before. Local Republican Congressman Steve King recently alienated many when he remarked that young migrants have calves the sizes of melons from carrying drugs. Those comments, in addition to Donald Trump's incendiary rhetoric on the campaign trail, which linked Mexicans to ""rapists"" and ""criminals,"" prompted hundreds of Latinos to protest the Republican frontrunner during a political event in Sioux City.  Just what are the issues which matter most to Iowa Latinos? To be sure, many are still disappointed with the Obama administration's failure to enact comprehensive immigration reform. Some in fact still smart from the memory of a 2006 immigration raid at Marshalltown's Swift and Co. meatpacking plant. As a result of the raid, dozens of workers were arrested and parents were abruptly separated from their families. Outraged over the authorities' high-handed approach, Latino youth at the local high school staged a walkout. Two years later, officials raided another meatpacking plant in the northeastern Iowa town of Postville, arresting a whopping 400 undocumented migrants. To this day, some Latinos worry that a routine traffic stop could result in deportation. Iowa's Latino Youth Vote It would be a mistake, however, to pigeonhole the diverse interests of the local Latino population. While immigration is a key issue to many, other concerns top the list such as education. That's not too surprising given the specific characteristics of Iowa's Latino population, which is quite young in comparison to the rest of the state. In fact, the median age of Latinos is 22 compared to 38 for Iowa as a whole. In Des Moines alone, Latinos make up 23 percent of students enrolled in public schools. Even though they represent a growing segment of the population, Iowa's Latinos lag far behind other state residents when it comes to acquiring a university degree, and college affordability ranks as a key concern.  Meanwhile, students in Iowa's three public universities are reportedly going into debt at alarming rates. Beset with such escalating debt, many students at Iowa's public colleges are dropping out. The Iowa Press Citizen reports that the state ""has the dubious distinction of ranking No. 8 in the country in average student debt, at just under $30,000. Iowa's community college students also take out loans at more than twice the national average, and most of the schools' students have a higher-than-average default rate.""Revamping the ""Political Revolution"" With just a scant two weeks to go before the Iowa caucus, just where does this underlying context leave Bernie Sanders? To his credit, the Vermont Senator has done his utmost to engage with Latinos on many of the pressing issues of the day. Though his initial stance on immigration was somewhat convoluted and perplexing, Bernie has made great strides and has developed a progressive and forward-looking immigration platform. And on education, another key concern within the Latino community, Sanders advocates free tuition at public colleges. In fact, the democratic socialist even met with Latinos in the town of Muscatine to discuss his specific proposals. So far so good, but Bernie has been extremely reluctant to expand the definition of his ""political revolution."" Ostensibly, the candidate conceives of his revolution as people coming together for the purpose of phone banking, canvassing and the like. In the event that he gets elected, Bernie might even marshal his supporters in advance of key votes in Congress. Yet as I've stated in previous columns, there's no rule stating that a presidential candidate can't call for political protest in the midst of a campaign. Adopting more radical and innovative tactics could be particularly relevant in Iowa, where the polls are razor thin and turning out the Latino vote could mean the difference between victory and defeat. Retooling Iowa Strategy Thus far, Bernie has advanced many progressive ideas which will appeal to Iowa's Latino voters. The problem, however, is that some may still be unfamiliar with the maverick politician. Now that Bernie is enjoying some increased visibility in the media spotlight, he might want to take advantage of the attention by launching well-coordinated protests in Iowa or elsewhere.  On immigration, for example, Bernie might help to protest U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers, where Latino migrants are routinely subjected to deplorable and inhumane conditions. While he's at it, Sanders could help organize student protests calling for free public tuition at local Iowa colleges. Perhaps, Bernie might also seek to deploy Latino pop icons at such events which would surely appeal to the youth vote. To be sure, such tactics are not guaranteed to succeed. However, by thinking creatively Bernie may wind up attracting more scrutiny from Iowa's Latinos. They in turn will be impressed that Sanders is at least willing to experiment and potentially spearhead a movement while breaking out of the narrow and standard confines of a presidential campaign.Nikolas Kozloff is a New York-based writer who has written extensively on the concept of revolutionary change.

(Photo by Marcus Ingram/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb92cd32200004301dd9421.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Having come of age during the Clinton era, I always had a soft spot for Chelsea Clinton. She wasn't much younger than I was, so to watch her receive heartless slights and vicious criticisms about her appearance and pubescent awkwardness always hit home. Even though I didn't have a father who was the leader of the free world, I could viscerally relate to Chelsea's desire to be left alone. Today, I think, like myself, she is probably quite relieved to have experienced much of her own coming of age prior to the digital era. I can't imagine what social media might have done to her had it been around in the '90s.Fast forward to now, and Chelsea is a very bright and academically accomplished professional. For the most part, she managed to tiptoe around her mother's politics as U.S. Senator, Secretary of State, and candidate for Democratic presidential nominee. In the meantime, Chelsea racked up a B.A. from Stanford, a Ph.D. from Oxford, and a M.P.H. from Columbia. The last degree is of particular interest, considering Chelsea's recent false assertions regarding Bernie Sanders's plan to address the Affordable Care Act and the general state of healthcare within the U.S. should he become president, but we'll get to that in a minute. Chelsea, meanwhile, also worked for the management consulting firm, McKinsey & Company, as well as the private equity firm, Avenue Capital Group. She rounded out this primarily financial pedigree by marrying a particularly well-to-do investment banker. So, in short, like her mother before her, Chelsea has a lot of impressive titles as well as some arguably varied experience. It also doesn't hurt to be wealthy enough to purchase a $10.5 million condo in Manhattan. Having said this, Chelsea really doesn't have much to stand on when it comes to politics. I suppose that, as the daughter of both a former U.S. president and a potential U.S. president, she is somewhat credible by association, but what does that truly net? Her accomplishments are difficult to pin down in spite of all of the exposure, connections, resources and power that a daughter of a U.S. president and of a U.S. Senator has. Just to sidebar-contrast her with another bright and academically accomplished woman in Chelsea's relative age bracket -- who also works in politics and in journalism, who also happens to have a B.A. from Stanford and a Ph.D. from Oxford, but who is not the daughter of a U.S. president and of a U.S. Senator -- take a look at Rachel Maddow. I think most of us can agree that Chelsea Clinton is no Rachel Maddow. And my friends who are career journalists know this especially well after having watched Chelsea flub a journalistic opportunity of a lifetime when she was ordained as a special correspondent for NBC with a reported salary of $600,000, but faltered repeatedly, if not ineptly, on NBC's now-cancelled, nationally televised program, Rock Center. Indeed, Chelsea Clinton is no Rachel Maddow. So what? Chelsea is her own person, with her own attributes and her own contributions (difficult as they may be to identify). Okay, well let's explore her latest ""contribution"" by observing what now can be considered her official campaigning on behalf of her mother. Earlier this week in New Hampshire -- during her first solo appearance on behalf of Hillary's campaign -- Chelsea made the claim that Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, dismantle private insurance...[which would]...strip millions and millions and millions of people of their health insurance.Uhm, how many millions was that, Chelsea?Since what many Democrats are calling Chelsea's misleading, if not utterly cynical, attack this week, outlets such as Politifact have debunked her statements, rating them as ""mostly false."" I find this particularly curious considering Chelsea's post-graduate education in public health. One would think that, no matter how badly she wanted her mother to win the nomination, Chelsea would find a way to speak favorably of her preferred candidate but to remain accurate or, at least, nebulous in her assertions. 'Nebulous' tends to work auspiciously (or, rather, not inauspiciously) for many politicians. Yet Chelsea, who holds a master's degree in public health, spoke plainly inaccurately and, some would even say, with an intention to incite fear and cause confusion (which isn't very nice, is it?).Yes, politics can get dirty. And, yes, everything a politician or his or her campaign says should be taken with a grain of salt. But some things shouldn't be taken with anything at all, especially from people who don't know what they're talking about. I'm sure Chelsea is a very nice person. She and I happen to have several mutual acquaintances; and just this week I received an invitation to hear her speak at a private fundraising gathering for her mother. Speak about what exactly? I have no idea. More importantly, I have no interest. And neither should you."

Don't all candidates use family surrogates when and where they can? The Kennedys, for example, deployed a horde of kinfolk for Jack's campaign for president, then Bobby's, then Teddy's.But when it's the first time (as this was for Clinton the younger), the surrogate should be sure whereof she speaks, and had better stick to talking about her candidate, not the opponent. Unfortunately, Chelsea Clinton misrepresented Senator Sanders' position, and her premiere performance on the stump backfired, producing a flood of political donations to Sanders.Here's what she said: ""Senator Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the [Children's Health Insurance Program], dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance."" Whew! She would have us believe that the Vermont senator is a one-man wrecking crew, an enraged King Kong -- or, to be modern about it, a mendacious Darth Vader -- proposing ""to go back to an era -- before we had the Affordable Care Act -- that would strip millions and millions and millions of people off their health insurance.""Uh, not exactly. In fact, not even close. As Karen Tumulty noted in The Washington Post, Bernie Sanders has long been a champion of a single-payer health care system as the only way to assure that all Americans receive medical coverage. Rather than ""strip"" millions and millions of people of their health insurance, he wants to be sure millions and millions of people actually get health insurance.This was Sanders' position as far back as 1993 when newly-elected President Bill Clinton put First Lady Hillary Clinton in charge of reforming our disheveled and unjust health care system. Her task force huffed and puffed in secret for months, calling in legions of experts and academics, ultimately producing a plan so complicated and impenetrable - not to mention unexplainable - that it would have collapsed of its own ponderous weight even if the Republicans had not propagandized it into a laughing stock of pretensions and inefficiencies that could only make matters worse.And here's an ironic note: During that 1993 quest for a health care plan, Secretary Clinton sent Sanders an autographed picture of the two of them, wishing him the best and thanking the senator ""for your commitment to real health care access for all Americans.""All these years later, Sanders is still fighting the battle for single-payer, Medicare-like coverage for all, even as fellow Democrats capitulated to the siren songs of the health and insurance industries. President Obama, himself a one-time advocate of single-payer coverage, buckled to the insurance companies and its lobbyists and minions in Congress and agreed to health care legislation (the Affordable Care Act) that would continue to treat healing the sick as a profit center instead of a basic human right.And look at former presidential candidate and single-payer advocate Howard Dean, Bernie's fellow Vermonter, who went on MSNBC this week and said that the Sanders plan ""would in fact undo people's health care... That is something people should be concerned about.""Why the change of heart? Maybe because Dean ""now serves as senior advisor to the law firm Dentons, where he works with the firm's Public Policy and Regulation practice, a euphemism for Dentons' lobbying team,"" Lee Fang reports at The Intercept. ""The Dentons Public Policy and Regulation practice lobbies on behalf of a variety of corporate health care interests, including the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America [PhRMA], a powerful trade group for drugmakers like Pfizer and Merck.""Fang notes that, ""Incumbent health care interests, particularly drug companies and insurers, have long viewed single-payer as a threat to their business model,"" and points to documents that we uncovered in 2009 on Bill Moyers Journal with the help of former health insurance executive, now whistleblower Wendell Potter. They showed a systematic plan by health insurers to discredit single-payer.As president of the Clinton Foundation, the richly endowed philanthropy that has become the family's private station for public causes, Chelsea Clinton must know this. The cynic might think the more than $2.6 million given so far by the health industry to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and outside groups supporting her (three times that of any other candidate, Democrat or Republican) might be leading Chelsea Clinton to use the same kind of false accusations so long used against her parents. But why would any of the family, their campaign team, advisors and supporters assume that the public would accept such a wild and irresponsible distortion?"

That first book drew me deeply into the magical world of Harry Potter, and from then on I was hooked. I went to every summer movie premiere with my swim team, and every December premiere with my school friends. I knew the spells, imitated the actors's voices, jumped up and down every time I received another book in the mail, memorized the movie scenes.  I found the Harry Potter series compelling for a number of reasons. First, I was in love with Cedric Diggory, the ill-fated hearthrob of Hogwarts. I cried so much after reading his death that my mom warned other mothers about the fourth book. Secondly, I found the idea of a magical world hidden just beneath the more mundane muggle world incredibly exciting. (I was extremely disappointed when my ticket into the magic, a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, never arrived...) However what most fascinated me about J.K. Rowling's creation, and what has continued to stand out to me as one of the most significant parts of the series, is the way the Rowling and the movies portrayed good and evil. When we are young, it's commonplace to see the world as good vs. evil, black vs. white. Many novels and movies reinforce this simplistic worldview. This is why Harry Potter is so very important: the Harry Potter series shows that humans have good inside them and evil inside them, but what is important is that you have the choice to decide which one you will be. Snape, objectively, was not a good character. He was a person who had both evil and good inside him, but his love for Lily and loyalty towards her caused him to do some good things. He helped Harry and fought for Dumbledore because Harry was Lily's son and because Dumbledore promised to protect Lily and later Harry. To the end, Snape was grey, and Alan Rickman portrayed this beautifully. Rickman, with guidance early on from Rowling herself, established Snape from the beginning not as an evil man, but rather as one troubled by the darkness inside him and consumed with the goodness he sought in the form of Lily. What Rickman so brilliantly revealed, movie by movie, was this struggle that Snape faced in dealing with the grey that was inside him. This inner dilemma that Rickman brought out in the character of Snape, that good and evil are everywhere but that we have the ability to choose what we want to be, is the most important lesson I learned from Harry Potter.  Alan Rickman, thank you for helping to teach me what is means to be the grey, and to strive for the good. Thank you for eight movies that shaped me as a young adult and that shared the journey of growing up with me. You created many characters that will never be forgotten, and left a legacy that has touched children and adults around the world. As he himself said, ""[a] film, a piece of theater, a piece of music, or a book can make a difference. It can change the world.""Thank you, Alan Rickman, for changing mine."

Refraining from a traditional laundry list of policy proposals, he stayed rooted in big themes about America, our future and the challenges ahead. He spoke eloquently about how our democracy is built upon ""voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love."" But ""the most important thing [he] want[ed] to say"" was that ""the future we want ... will only happen if we fix our politics."" Among other things, we ""have to reduce the influence of money in our politics"" that allows ""hidden interests [to] bankroll our elections. ... If our existing approach to campaign finance can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution.""I watched the speech with three close friends. One of them asked a question I'm sure was repeated in living rooms across the country: ""Okay, sounds good; but what are the action steps?"" We've heard President Obama talk plenty about the problem of money in politics. In his 2010 State of the Union, the President famously called out the Supreme Court one week after its 5-4 decision in Citizens United. And in last year's address, he mentioned the need to ""spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter."" Americans, too, are well acquainted with the problem of money in politics. They know that the power of big money is a barrier to the kind of democracy that works for everyone. It makes it harder for Americans who lack personal resources or wealthy connections to mount competitive campaigns. As the President put it in August, ""the influence of Super PACs and the ability of a handful of billionaires to dictate who can compete or not compete ... that's a problem."" A New York Times/CBS News poll last summer found that 84% of Americans - irrespective of party - believe that money has too much influence in political campaigns today.What we need are solutions. The same poll found that 85% of us believe we should ""fundamentally change"" or ""completely rebuild"" the system for funding political campaigns. There are real solutions - some that the president can implement alone, some requiring cooperation with Congress, some at the administrative level, and some implemented at the state level - that will restore balance to our campaign finance system. Moreover, they pass constitutional muster and enjoy broad support from Americans of all political stripes.The solutions are discussed in the ""Fighting Big Money, Empowering People: A 21st Century Democracy Agenda"" that 13 groups, including Common Cause, are urging presidential candidates to adopt. They are built on successes at the federal, state, and municipal levels. The agenda is guided by five principals of democracy, along with policies that will put it in practice:Everyone participates. It's important that everyone have a fair chance to influence their representatives based on the merits of their ideas - not the size of their bank accounts. Voter-owned, publicly financed campaigns would set new priorities on Capitol Hill and in state legislatures throughout the country. Proposals to do this would provide public funds to amplify small donations to candidates that agree to lower contribution limits. Such systems have had great success at the state level in Connecticut and at the municipal level in New York City, for example. In Maine, a robust majority of voters updated the state's system in November. Public financing lets legislators spend less time fundraising from deep-pocketed out-of-state donors and more time with neighbors and constituents. It also would provide a more diverse Congress that is more representative of America. Voter-owned publicly financed campaigns would go a long way toward restoring the fundamental promise of democracy, giving us representatives responsive to the needs of their constituents and not just their financial backers. Bills pending in Congress to implement this system include the Government By the People Act, the Empowering Citizens Act, the EMPOWER Act, and the Fair Elections Now Act. Everyone's voice is heard. In McCutcheon v. FEC, another 5-4 Supreme Court decision that ushered more money into politics, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in his dissent that ""where enough money calls the tune, the general public will not be heard."" That's why it's important to maintain meaningful contribution limits - so that everyday Americans aren't drowned out by wealthy spenders. Some states like Oregon and Virginia have no contribution limits at all - politicians can accept checks in any amount from any source. That brings with it the risk that Justice Breyer warned about. The Supreme Court has long upheld contribution limits to candidates and parties.Everyone knows who is trying to influence our views and our representatives. A fully informed electorate is key to a healthy democracy. Transparency in political spending lets us follow-the-money and gauge for ourselves who - and what - might be influencing our representatives' decisions. The Supreme Court - by a vote of 8-1 in Citizens United - upheld disclosure laws so that the voters may ""give proper weight to different speakers"" and decide ""whether elected officials are 'in the pocket' of so-called moneyed interests."" Since 2010, nearly one-third of outside money - to the tune of more than $500,000,000 - has come from secret sources. Congress could shine a light on this money by passing the DISCLOSE Act, which would require organizations spending money to influence elections to disclose their major donors to the public. Importantly, the DISCLOSE Act would fill in the gaps after Citizens United and let voters see the ultimate sources of campaign-spending - even when the money is funneled through shell organizations. States like Massachusetts and Rhode Island have passed new laws modeled on the DISCLOSE Act. Even with a gridlocked Congress, agencies like the Federal Election Commission have independent authority to update their disclosure regulations post-Citizens United; the Securities & Exchange Commission could require public corporations to disclose political spending to shareholders; the Federal Communications Commission could require advertisers to disclose their ""true identity;"" and the Department of Treasury could draw brighter lines about political activity so that organizations do not abuse the system to hide campaign donors. And pursuant to his own authority, President Obama could sign an executive order - as over one million people have urged - to require federal contractors to disclose their political spending. According to Public Citizen, this would reach at least 70% of Fortune 100 companies. Everyone plays by fair, common-sense rules. President Obama made clear in his State of the Union that solutions must ""pass muster in the courts."" All of the solutions discussed so far are consistent with the Supreme Court's guidance - namely, that campaign finance laws may only survive First Amendment scrutiny if they curb corruption and its appearance. A discussion of how the Court's definition of corruption has narrowed under the Roberts Court is beyond the scope of this blog post. Still, there are other constitutional rationales - such as political equality - that could justify our campaign finance laws. It may take new Supreme Court justices - or even a constitutional amendment - to restore this jurisprudence and allow Congress and the states to pass stronger laws than those discussed above. Everyone is held accountable, with enforceable penalties to deter bad behavior. Our laws are only as good as they are enforced. The Federal Election Commission is notoriously dysfunctional and increasingly failing to rein in violations of the law. Commissioner Ann Ravel, who stepped down as FEC Chair two weeks ago but remains on the Commission, told the New York Times that the ""likelihood of the laws being enforced is slim. People think the FEC is dysfunctional. It's worse than dysfunctional."" One solution would create a new agency with real power to hold violators accountable - and to write regulations consistent with the law. A bipartisan bill - the Restoring Integrity to America's Elections Act - is now pending in Congress. It would, among other things, reduce partisanship on the Commission and give the agency the teeth it needs to uphold public confidence in the integrity of our campaign finance system. These solutions are far from exhaustive - and are by no means exclusive. Together, we can work to put these in place and stay true to the promise of democracy."

One of them is giving a speech. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb33ad6240000310055caa5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether you've been in business for 10 days or 10 years, whether you've got $10,000 in revenue or $10 billion in revenue, there will be competition in whatever pond you're in. As the pond starts to fill up, even if you're at the top, someone or something is gaining on you to knock you from your perch.To continually innovate and keep things going, you must do one (or more) of these: find a bigger pond, explore new ponds, expand the pond you're in, or move to new bodies of water and go deep-sea fishing. It starts by asking yourself these questions:• What's next? • What do we need to do to reach our goals? • How will our brand, services, products, technologies, and above all our people keep standing out from the rest?For me, it was making myself big in my hometown of Sioux Falls, then the state of South Dakota. When I was big in South Dakota, I realized there are 49 other states I need to make myself big in. Once I've made myself big in the other 49 states, it's on to South America, Europe, and beyond. I started with my local pond of Sioux Falls and am working on expanding to global ponds and oceans. The best way to look for and find new ponds is to be willing to start all over. To do it successfully, you must follow these three A's to success:• Adapt • Ask • Automate  Adapt - Re-Envision the PondWhen I first launched C-Suite with Jeffrey Hayzlett on Bloomberg Television, it took off like a rocket. When Season 2 never came to fruition on Bloomberg, haters thought it was because it was cancelled - and they couldn't be further from the truth. The show was so successful that I brought it in house on C-Suite TV and on the business channel on United Airlines. I knew there was something bigger out there and was ready to adapt and meet it head on.Adapting means being ready to change at a moment's notice, and to be prepared for anything. I adapted C-Suite to be delivered online on C-Suite TV, breaking away from the traditional TV model because I firmly believe that's where the future of TV is heading. For me, personally, I don't ever take on a project without thinking at least five to ten years ahead, so I can map out how I can get it there.The speed of business today makes adaptation more essential than ever. You must strike a balance between satisfying demand for who you are and what you offer now and adapting.Ask - Find New PondsTraditionally, businesses find new ponds by building new stores, expanding their reach, tapping new markets, or buying competitors. But the concern here is overexpansion, which can lead to the pond drying up. What leads to overexpansion? Failing to translate your value proposition to new markets. What's effective in one market may not translate well whatsoever in another. The key to expanding and finding new ponds? Asking questions and, more importantly, genuinely listen. Take the time to understand and listen to what your current and potential future customers are telling you before tapping them.Automate - Move Faster in Your PondIf moving to a new pond or growing the pond are not options, then you need to become the most efficient, deadly, fish in the pond you're currently in. Become the biggest, baddest version of you you can be through better communication, automation, and systemization. However, don't confuse the word automation with personal. You can automate your communications without losing a beat of personalization. But by moving repetitive tasks to become automated, like welcome emails or drip campaigns, you're freeing up valuable time.In business, we can't be so fixated on attracting new customers that we forgo our greatest asset - happy, current customers who keep coming back for more. If you can't expand or move ponds, then these people are your bread and butter, responsible for most of your profits, and who should be protected at all costs.The KeyThere's always someone bigger in you than your pond. The key to becoming the biggest and baddest? Always ask yourself what's next. This way, you can determine whether you should grow your pond, find new ponds, or do better in your current pond to decide how to grow and sustain your business."
