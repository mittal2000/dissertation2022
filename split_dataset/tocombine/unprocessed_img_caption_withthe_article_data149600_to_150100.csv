Report",,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexico-obesity-rate-united-states_us_5b9d55b1e4b03a1dcc86c62e,And now some more news: Mexico has surpassed the U.S. in terms of obese and overweight residents. The new data comes from,2013-07-09,"Public health experts blame changes in lifestyle that have made Mexicans more obese than anywhere else on Earth except the United States. They attribute changes to powerful snack and soft drink industries, newly sedentary ways of living and a genetic heritage susceptible to diabetes, a chronic, life-threatening illness. (Heriberto Rodriguez/MCT via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d55b12500003200366af4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States has long held the dubious title of the world's most obese populous country. Unlike other national superlatives, No. 1 in obesity is a distinction we spend a great deal of effort trying to shed. As in weight loss, our small incremental changes may be making a dent: Although rates of obesity haven't yet dropped, they have plateaued, according to CDC reports. And now some more news: Mexico has surpassed the U.S. in terms of obese and overweight residents. The new data comes from a United Nations report, which found that 32.8 percent of Mexican citizens are overweight, compared to 31.8 percent of Americans. Meanwhile, 70 percent of Mexican adults are overweight, compared to U.S. adults, 69 percent of whom fall under a category that includes overweight and obese figures. The reason for Mexico's ascendance? More processed and calorie-rich food, little nutrition literacy and a citizenry that struggles to make ends meet, reported the Daily Mail. The U.N. report's main author additionally blamed increased urbanization for the shift: With more sedentary, urban jobs and a higher concentration of commercially available snack food, it's hard for many to maintain a healthy weight. Much like the U.S., obesity in Mexico disproportionately affects the poor and the young -- childhood obesity, for example, has tripled in the past 10 years and one in three Mexican teenagers could be classified as obese. ""The same people who are malnourished are the ones who are becoming obese,"" Dr. Abelardo Avila, a physician with Mexico's National Nutrition Institute, told CBS. ""In the poor classes we have obese parents and malnourished children. The worst thing is the children are becoming programmed for obesity. It's a very serious epidemic.""All this obesity has led to a steady rise in diabetes, reported Fox News, with 400,000 new diabetes diagnoses each year and 70,000 yearly deaths caused by weight-related diabetes. Officials say that this is not a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to Mexico's changing food culture. In fact, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (who conducted the official report) issued a warning to Mexico two years ago, reported CBS. "

I am looking forward to meeting and working with this actress, who drove me and a million other guys up the wall with desire when she rode the mechanical bull in Urban Cowboy, not to mention her smoldering, no BS presence in many other films. Feeling confident from my big film pedigree, I introduce myself on Debra's first day. ""Hi, I'm Robert Zuckerman, the still photographer."" ""Nice to meet you, and I hope this is the last I see of you,"" she replies. Whoa, don't hold back, I think. But at the same time, I appreciate her honesty and understand her wariness of how she is portrayed. The next day Debra approaches me with a compliment of a photo of mine she saw in a magazine last night. I tell her about a photo I made of her son 11 years earlier (age 4 at the time) when I worked on a film with her ex-husband, Timothy Hutton. Her eyes light up: ""That is my favorite picture! It's in my living room!"" From this moment on, we are fast friends. During filming, I get to know this person of great character, who does not suffer hypocrisy or BS and is ever true to her values and beliefs. After filming, we stay in touch and keep each other updated on the currents of family, work and life overall. I hear of her sons growing up, of her commitment to motherhood, of summers in the mountains. Today we meet in person for the first time in six years, on a bench by the Hudson River in Harlem. She brings sandwiches and coffee and we catch up, as the river flows. Her older son, the one I photographed, is now a college grad, and an up and coming independent filmmaker. Her younger son is in school in the Bronx. ""I have to go pick him up at that Lefty Knee-Jerk Liberal Socialist school!"" she says, smiling, with loving honesty. She gives me a ride to my next stop where we say goodbye and continue on into our days, enriched by the boundless, timeless gift of friendship.info@kindsightfoundation.org www.robertzuckerman.comFor more by Robert G.

Periodically, throughout this CSA season, we'll help you make use of your overflowing CSA baskets. You ask, we answer. That's how this works. Or rather, you shout, ""WTF?"" into your CSA box and now we're going to tell what on earth to do with all that red and green leaf lettuce.We spend all the cold months feeding ourselves thick, heavy greens: kale, chard, overgrown spinach. By the time warmer temperatures and tenderer lettuces roll around, we can barely contain our excitement for an easy summer salad, full of raw vegetables. If our farmer's markets were any indication this week, your CSA boxes probably contained at least one head of red leaf lettuce and green leaf lettuce. These lettuces are tender, mild, a little bit nutty and so pretty. We always want to encourage you guys to try crazy things with your CSA share ingredients -- pickled garlic scapes, stuffed whole kohlrabi, etc. But these sweet summer lettuces are short lived, and sometimes your body demands a salad. In that spirit, we pulled together a few of our favorite ways to use green leaf and red leaf lettuce, mostly salads with a few wildcards. Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?
