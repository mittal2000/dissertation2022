Its purpose: To deter Russian aggression while serving to reassure Western allies of U.S. commitment to the region.General Philip Breedlove, the top U.S. commander in Europe, announced the plan on Wednesday, calling it a “strong and balanced approach to reassuring our NATO Allies and partners in the wake of an aggressive Russia in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.”“Our allies and partners will see more capability,” he said in a statement. “They will see a more frequent presence of an armored brigade with more modernized equipment in their countries.”The new proposal would put an additional U.S. armored brigade in Europe, specifically along NATO’s eastern flank. The brigade, which typically comprises about 4,200 soldiers and hundreds of heavy vehicles, tanks and other equipment, will rotate in on a continual basis, and will be divided across six countries: Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the commander of U.S. Army Europe, said the proposal would create “a constant presence of U.S. forces along NATO’s eastern border.”“There will be American equipment and people in each of these countries,” Hodges told the Journal. “We will have the flexibility to converge the entire brigade for exercises and that is an important part of the deterrence, to show a warfighting capability.”Slated to start in February 2017, the plan will increase the number of U.S. combat brigades in Europe to three. Currently, there are approximately 62,000 U.S. military forces, including a reported 25,000 Army soldiers, permanently based in the continent. According to Pentagon spokeswoman Laura Seal, the proposal will also allow for the U.S. to bring in more advanced equipment to eastern Europe. “This will be the most modernized equipment the Army has to offer, and will, over the next year, replace the less modern training equipment we put in Europe over the last few years,"" Seal told AP.The new gear will reportedly include 250 tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Paladin self-propelled howitzers and more than 1,700 additional wheeled vehicles.According to Mashable, the Pentagon requested $3.4 billion in February for the initiative, after the White House gave the go-ahead.

2,THE WORLDPOST,"Afghans Haunted By U.S. Strikes On MSF Hospital Want The Truth, Not Money And Apologies",Sophia Jones,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/afghanistan-hospital-bombing_us_56fa5f64e4b0143a9b492c21,"Six months after the attack that killed 42 men, women and children, the U.S. military's lack of transparency is still hurting Afghans.",2016-03-31,"MSF staff hide in the basement as a U.S. attack aircraft repeatedly bombs the trauma clinic in Kunduz, Afghanistan, Oct. 3, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fa601d1e00008e01711869.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARWAN, Afghanistan -- A bullet through the head didn’t kill 9-year-old Amina. Her father, Abdel Qadir, had managed to carry her limp body to the trauma hospital in Kunduz, praying that she would live. But on Oct. 3, less than a week after surviving a firefight between Afghan forces and Taliban insurgents that had surrounded her home, Amina burned to death in a hospital bed as her father watched helplessly. Her last words were screamed in terrified pain.“Father! Father!” she wailed as flames consumed her body, Abdel Qadir recalled, weeping. It's been nearly six months since a U.S. attack aircraft bombed the Médecins Sans Frontières trauma clinic where Amina was staying. Time has not yielded clarity -- there still seem to be more questions than answers. And the U.S. military’s lack of transparency has only compounded people's mistrust.According to Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. general in Afghanistan at the time, what happened in Kunduz was a “tragic but avoidable accident.” MSF, the international medical aid organization that ran the hospital, has described the assault as a potential war crime. Amina and at least 41 other men, women and children perished in the attack on the clinic, which had been the only hospital of its kind providing free trauma care in northern Afghanistan. And while the bombing happened six months ago, the murky circumstances under which it occurred are still having a chilling effect on medical care in the area.MSF has said it cannot make a decision about re-opening the trauma hospital until all parties to the conflict can ensure the safety of MSF staff, patients and medical facilities. ""We need assurances that we can work according to our core principles and to international law,"" an MSF spokesperson told The WorldPost on Thursday. ""Namely, that we can safely treat all people in need, no matter who they are, or for which side they fight.""As of now, the clinic can only treat a small number of patients, many of them victims wounded in the Kunduz attack. This leaves many Afghans with no choice but to travel to the capital -- a trip that can take hours, often via dangerous roads -- to find free, high-quality emergency medical care. READ MORE: Inside The Last Refuge For Afghanistan's War WoundedSurvivors of the Oct. 3 bombing describe a nightmarish scene. The first strike hit the intensive care unit. Doctors, some with severed limbs, bled out in front of colleagues. Others were gunned down as they ran for their lives. Patients died on the operating table mid-surgery. Those who were unable to run -- like young Amina, a clever girl who loved computers -- were incinerated.The U.S. military has reportedly responded by reviewing its targeting process, re-training its forces on rules of engagement and disciplining more than a dozen service members -- including officers and enlisted personnel, but not generals -- who took part in the attack. The service members will not, however, face any criminal charges.U.S. Central Command has not yet published its investigation into the attack, which is reported to be 3,000 pages or more. The investigation cannot go public until certain material has been redacted, according to Brig. Gen. Wilson Shoffner, chief spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, who spoke to The WorldPost in Kabul in late January. The military has ignored multiple calls by MSF and other parties for a truly independent investigation by an outside group, arguing instead that fact-finding efforts carried out by military officers outside the chain of command in Afghanistan would be ""thorough and unbiased.""Basic details are still up for debate. The U.S. military insists the strikes went on for 29 minutes. MSF and survivors say the targeted assault dragged on for at least an hour. And larger questions remain. In the days leading up to the Oct. 3 attack, Taliban insurgents had caught Afghan forces off guard and took control of Kunduz, including the area surrounding the MSF hospital.They quickly established their infamous brand of terror, looting buildings, freeing prisoners, taking over homes and hunting down women's rights activists who dared defy their violent ideology. It was the first time the extremists had taken over a major Afghan city in 14 years. Afghan and U.S. forces alike were desperate to push them out. According to U.S. military statements on the incident, a U.S. Special Forces commander called in the strike, carried out by a powerful AC-130 gunship, at the request of Afghan forces on the ground. U.S. forces did not have eyes on the target before calling in the strikes, the Associated Press reported in November.They instead placed trust in their Afghan allies who had, just three months earlier, violated international law by raiding that same clinic, shooting in the air and attacking three staff members while allegedly searching for an unarmed, highly ranked al Qaeda patient.The U.S. military has repeatedly insisted it would not knowingly target the MSF's clinic, and has said it did not know it was shelling a hospital, even though the trauma center was on the military’s no-strike list and its exact coordinates were no mystery. MSF had sent the coordinates to U.S. forces and NATO allies as recently as Sept. 29 -- four days before the bombing.Frantic calls and texts during the attack from MSF to the Operation Resolute Support headquarters in Kabul proved futile. Thirty minutes after MSF’s initial call for help, at 2:19 a.m., someone at the NATO mission texted back, saying: ""I’m sorry to hear that, I still do not know what happened."" When MSF warned that the death toll was growing, the person responded: “I’ll do my best, praying for you all.”Campbell, the army general, has blamed a deadly combination of unfortunate events for the strike. U.S. forces misidentified the target and launched 69 minutes early without verifying whether the target was on a no-strike list. Technical glitches onboard the AC-130 meant troops could not send or receive electronic messages or video. The aircraft, forced beyond its normal orbit by a missile, could not accurately strike a target. ""Why did nobody take the decision to hold off and say that they weren't sure?” said Guilhem Molinie, MSF's representative in Afghanistan. ""It questions the capacity of NATO in this country and many other armies to be indiscriminate in the way they conduct warfare and respect the Geneva Conventions.""Afghan officials, including the acting governor of Kunduz, Hamdullah Danishi, insisted in the days after the bombing that the Taliban had used the compound to launch attacks on Afghan forces, a claim MSF fiercely rejects.“That was a time of fighting -- some things happen,” Danishi told The WorldPost in early February. “I know the Taliban. They are using everywhere as bases. I cannot say if [the hospital] was a military base or not. But they were there, 100 percent.”A dozen MSF staff, surviving civilians, Kunduz residents and family members of patients told The WorldPost they saw no armed gunmen on the hospital grounds at any time before or during the strikes. The clinic had a strict no-weapons policy. “It’s completely untrue that there were Taliban inside the hospital,” said Dr. Mohammad Omar, an MSF emergency room supervisor who survived the attack.Just two days before the strikes, Carter Malkasian, a top adviser to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reached out to MSF, asking whether there were Taliban “holed up” in the hospital. He was told that while there were no armed combatants inside the compound, there were indeed Taliban patients being treated. Malkasian declined a request by The WorldPost for more information. MSF staff have, for years, treated people on all sides of the conflict, including patients believed to be high-ranking insurgents. That leaves many Afghans and medical professionals wondering whether the presence of wounded but unarmed Taliban patients inside the clinic may have prompted the Oct. 3 strike. The attack has raised concerns over the current U.S. role in Afghanistan, and questions about the presence of special forces now that the United States’ combat mission is formally over. American forces are primary in a “train, advise and assist” capacity, though it seems troops are still finding themselves in active combat situations.The Kunduz attack is also yet another stain on the U.S. military’s reputation in Afghanistan. Survivors and family of people killed in the bombing still have no closure, no real explanation as to why the attack occurred. And there's very little confidence among Afghans that such an “accident” won’t happen again.“The Americans have access to good information,” Abdel Qadir said, sitting cross-legged on the floor of a guesthouse in Parwan, an Afghan city between Kabul and Kunduz, as rain pitter-pattered outside. “Why would they make this mistake?”As with past combat incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq that led to civilian deaths, the U.S. military has made more than 100 condolence payments to family members of Kunduz victims, according to Shoffner. Some recipients say they've received around $6,000 or $7,000 each -- the U.S.-determined price of life for a daughter, brother or father wrongfully killed. A brother of one of the slain MSF doctors told The WorldPost that he refused the money, instead giving it to other families who needed it more. He said he learned of his brother’s death via Facebook, after someone posted a photo of ashes with the caption, “Here is the body of Dr. Osmani.”Gen. John W. Nicholson, the new head of NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, traveled to Kunduz on March 22 to personally apologize. “I grieve with you for your loss and suffering,” he said. “And humbly and respectfully ask for your forgiveness.”But despite the U.S. military’s efforts to remedy the horrific event, Afghans whose lives have been torn apart by the attack demand something far more difficult to come by than scripted apologies and condolence payments -- namely, the full truth.“They killed so many civilians,” said one male Kunduz resident who lives close to the MSF compound. “Most of the people here, their ideas changed of the American people. The people are angry. The Americans have the technology and the information. They can see if there are armed people or not.”“An apology is not enough,” continued the young man, who asked that his name not be published for security reasons. “I lost four friends -- two doctors, one nurse and one student.”An apology also means nothing to Omar, the ER doctor, who now lives in terror that such an attack will happen again. He’s far from the only one. The Italian-run Emergency Hospital in Lashkar Gah responded to the attack by building a bunker large enough to accommodate staff and patients.Omar said he remembers the Oct. 3 bombing like it was yesterday. As the attack aircraft unleashed hell outside, the experienced ER doctor thought there was no way he would survive. He called his wife to say goodbye. “She was crying,” Omar said solemnly. “It was the hardest moment of my life.”Omar survived because he was in the clinic's basement, where MSF staff had set up makeshift trauma stations in an attempt to save those they could.When the sound of the attack aircraft finally died out, people scrambled out from the ruins of the hospital, plumes of smoke still rising as much of the compound burned.Patients were loaded into ambulances that had come to collect the wounded. Some staff members, including foreigners, were whisked away to the airport. Many local staff had to fend for themselves, seeking shelter in nearby homes and hitching rides with helpful strangers.But the dead remained. Amina’s body still lay in the ICU. Her parents weren't able to collect her remains until days later.“I couldn’t save her,” cried Abdel Qadir, gasping for breath between sobs. “I took her ashes, her skeleton, and gave them to my wife.""Half a year after the fatal attack, Abdel Qadir is left with a wad of cash from the U.S. military. It does nothing to fix his broken heart. He remains haunted by a simple question: Why did his daughter have to die?All he can do is pray for Amina, the daughter he couldn’t save twice.Naiemullah Sangen contributed reporting from Parwan and Kabul."

(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fc58ac1500002a000b3a54.jpeg?cache=UgEMF8feOg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dustin VolzWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI may be allowed to withhold information about how it broke into an iPhone belonging to a gunman in the December San Bernardino shootings, despite a U.S. government policy of disclosing technology security flaws discovered by federal agencies.Under the U.S. vulnerabilities equities process, the government is supposed to err in favor of disclosing security issues so companies can devise fixes to protect data. The policy has exceptions for law enforcement, and there are no hard rules about when and how it must be applied.Apple Inc has said it would like the government to share how it cracked the iPhone security protections. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has been frustrated by its inability to access data on encrypted phones belonging to criminal suspects, might prefer to keep secret the technique it used to gain access to gunman Syed Farook's phone.The referee is likely to be a White House group formed during the Obama administration to review computer security flaws discovered by federal agencies and decide whether they should be disclosed.Experts said government policy on such reviews was not clear-cut, so it was hard to predict whether a review would be required. ""There are no hard and fast rules,"" said White House cybersecurity coordinator Michael Daniel, in a 2014 blog post about the process.If a review is conducted, many security researchers expect that the White House group will not require the FBI to disclose the vulnerability it exploited.Some experts said the FBI might be able to avoid a review entirely if, for instance, it got past the phone's encryption using a contractor's proprietary technology.Explaining the policy in 2014, the Office of the Director of National Security said the government should disclose vulnerabilities “unless there is a clear national security or law enforcement need.""The interagency review process also considers whether others are likely to find the vulnerability. It tends to focus on flaws in major networks and software, rather than individual devices.During a press call, a senior Justice Department official declined to disclose whether the method used on Farook's phone would work on other phones or would be shared with state and local law enforcement.Apple declined to comment beyond saying it would like the government to provide information about the technique used.PROTECTING ""CRUCIAL INTELLIGENCE""The government reorganized the review process roughly two years ago and has not disclosed which agencies regularly participate other than the Department of Homeland Security and at least one intelligence agency. A National Security Council spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about agency participation.In his April 2014 blog post, White House cybersecurity coordinator Daniel, who chairs the review group, said secrecy was sometimes justified.“Disclosing a vulnerability can mean that we forego an opportunity to collect crucial intelligence that could thwart a terrorist attack stop the theft of our nation’s intellectual property,” Daniel wrote.On Tuesday, a senior administration official said the vulnerability review process generally applies to flaws detected by any federal agency.Paul Rosenzweig, a former deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, said he would be “shocked” if the Apple vulnerability is not considered by the group.“I can’t imagine that on one of this significance that the FBI, even if it tried to, would succeed in avoiding the review process,” said Rosenzweig, founder of Red Branch Consulting, a homeland security consulting firm.He predicted the FBI would not be forced to disclose the vulnerability because it appears to require physical possession of a targeted phone and therefore poses minimal threat to Internet security more broadly.Many security researchers have suggested that the phone's content was probably retrieved after mirroring the device's storage chip to allow data duplication onto other chips, effectively bypassing limitations on the number of passcode guesses.Kevin Bankston, director of the think tank Open Technology Institute, said there is no public documentation of how the review process has worked in recent years. He said Congress should consider legislation to codify and clarify the rules.Stewart Baker, former general counsel of the NSA and now a lawyer with Steptoe & Johnson, said the review process could be complicated if the cracking method is considered proprietary by the third party that assisted the FBI.Several security researchers have pointed to the Israel-based mobile forensics firm Cellebrite as the likely third party that helped the FBI. That company has repeatedly declined comment.If the FBI is not required to disclose information about the vulnerability, Apple might still have a way to pursue details about the iPhone hack.The Justice Department has asked a New York court to force Apple to unlock an iPhone related to a drug investigation. If the government continues to pursue that case, the technology company could potentially use legal discovery to force the FBI to reveal what technique it used, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.At least one expert thinks a government review could require disclosure. Peter Swire, a professor of law at the Georgia Institute of Technology who served on the presidential intelligence review group that recommended the administration disclose most flaws, said there is “a strong case” for informing Apple about the vulnerability under the announced guidelines.“The process emphasizes the importance of defense for widely used, commercial software,” he said.(Reporting by Dustin Volz in Washington; Additional reporting by Dan Levine and Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Editing by Sue Horton, Peter Henderson and David Gregorio)"

Australia’s Fairfax Media and The Huffington Post on Wednesday published the results of a six-month investigation into Unaoil paying bribes on behalf of major corporations doing business in the Middle East. The reporting was supported by hundreds of thousands of leaked emails and documents. Before the articles were published, attorneys representing Unaoil and its owners, the Ahnsani family, requested that Fairfax Media -- which owns major Australian outlets like The Age newspaper -- turn over all copies of confidential information or data possessed by its journalists, Nick McKenzie and Richard Baker. “We also request that Fairfax desist from publishing any material concerning our clients until such time that our clients have been able to verify that their confidential data is not being used to make scandalous and defamatory allegations,” Rebekah Giles, an attorney in the Sydney office of law firm Kennedys, wrote in a March 29 letter. Giles wrote that the firm’s clients reserved the right to seek “urgent interlocutory relief"" -- in other words, an injunction to possibly prevent publication. That threat now seems moot, since Fairfax Media published the results of its investigation online Wednesday and in in its print edition on Thursday. Giles did not respond to a request for comment. In a separate article on Wednesday, McKenzie described the bribery investigation's unusual genesis. It began after he received a letter from a source, who asked that he place an advertisement in a French newspaper using the code name “Monte Christo.”McKenzie and the source communicated back and forth for several months and finally met in Europe. The award-winning journalist described being introduced later to additional sources and eventually receiving large chunks of information, including tens of thousands of Unaoil emails. “The sources of this story never asked for money,” McKenzie wrote. “What they wanted was for some of the wealthiest and most powerful figures in governments and companies across the globe to be exposed for acting corruptly, and with impunity, for years."""

Zucker kicked off Wednesday's employee town hall by saying that the previous night’s televised Republican forum, which featured Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, was the most-watched ever for that format. CNN averaged 3.26 million viewers during the three-hour event, with viewership jumping to more than 4 million during the second hour, which focused on Trump. The real estate mogul has been a ratings bonanza for cable news networks like CNN, which is up 165 percent in prime time from a year ago. At the same time, CNN and its network rivals have faced questions about the excessive amount of airtime given to Trump, who has benefited from having his rallies broadcast live and being able to routinely call in to news shows rather than appearing in person.During Wednesday's town hall, an employee asked why CNN seemed to devote “80 to 90 percent” of its airtime Tuesday to Trump, and to the news of the battery charge against his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. The employee pointed out that there were other significant news stories Tuesday, such as a Supreme Court decision on public-sector unions and President Barack Obama's pledge of new initiatives to fight opioid abuse.“We actually covered every one of these stories on CNN, but they weren't all necessarily on television,"" Zucker said, according to sources who were not authorized to discuss the internal meeting. Since taking the helm in 2012, Zucker has taken an all-in approach to CNN's television coverage, with certain big stories -- from the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 to the 2016 election -- dominating the channel. Zucker said Wednesday that CNN is ""covering more news than we have ever covered"" if one factors in the network's robust digital operation. A CNN spokeswoman reached by The Huffington Post did not provide a comment. Speaking at Wednesday's town hall, Zucker said there has been ""too much handwringing"" over the media's coverage of Trump, according to sources.CNN has also come under scrutiny for hiring two political commentators, Jeffrey Lord and Kayleigh McEnany, whose on-air roles seem to be primarily as Trump boosters and defenders. In September, The Washington Post's Erik Wemple reported that Trump's campaign had passed along Lord’s name to CNN in an effort to counter what it considered to be an excess of “Jeb Bush-friendly analysis” on the network. Lord spent time defending Trump as a unpaid guest before he was hired as a paid contributor. On Wednesday, Zucker said he’s “really comfortable"" with Lord's role at the network. The network chief touted CNN's “tremendously diverse roster of analysts,"" including Lord, as being a big part of the network's success this election cycle. Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

11,SPORTS,How Each Final Four Team Could Win The National Championship,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-each-team-can-win-national-championship_us_56f96da4e4b0a372181a7962,Because seeding no longer predicts winners.,2016-03-30,Freshman guard Malachi Richardson has been instrumental for Syracuse down the stretch.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f97fbf1e0000b30070578a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 2016 Final Four is upon us, which means most of the madness is unfortunately coming to an end. Your bracket is probably busted and Warren Buffett won't be dishing out that cool million bucks your way, but there's still some basketball left to watch. Here's a look at what each remaining team needs to do if it wants to cut down the nets in Houston next Monday night.SyracuseThe Orange have defied logic -- not just because they're the first ever 10-seed to reach the Final Four, but because even head coach Jim Boeheim didn't plan on making it this far. This is a Syracuse team that lost to lowly St. John's and Georgetown, and was swept in three games by Pittsburgh, including early on in the ACC Tournament.And yet, the Orange are here because of two highly gifted wings: freshman Malachi Richardson and senior Michael Gbinije, the Duke transfer. Both can score, and maybe just as importantly, both combine to give Boeheim's patented 2-3 matchup zone tremendous length on the perimeter. This limits high post entry passes and in turn, limits the 3-pointer, a classic weakness of any zone. From an offensive standpoint, however, shooting less than 37 percent from the floor -- as the Cuse did against Virginia in the Elite Eight -- won't suffice. The Orange get about 35 percent of their offense from the long ball, and for a team that has struggled to put the ball in the hoop all year, Syracuse desperately needs to be hitting from deep to notch the second title in school history.North CarolinaArguably the most talented and the deepest team in the field, Carolina relies heavily on its senior-laden roster, similarly to how it did during its 2005 and 2009 title runs under Roy Williams. The key for the Heels is quite simply not to change -- their average margin of victory in the tournament is 16 points. A renewed commitment to defense has been crucial for a team that ranks first nationally in adjusted offensive efficiency, per KenPom. Moreover, the Tar Heels rank first in the nation in 2-point attempts and makes. Because of their sensational offensive prowess, they're under a lot of pressure to score against UNC.They'll need to play a nearly flawless offensive game. Consider that a hyper-efficient Notre Dame team connected on 50 percent from deep, 55 percent from the floor and 78 percent from the stripe, and yet lost by double digits in the regional final. Senior trigger-man Marcus Paige has finally discovered his shooting stroke, senior forward Brice Johnson (Paige's roommate and close friend) just notched his school record 23rd double-double of the season (ranking fifth nationally) and ACC Sixth Man of the Year Isaiah Hicks continues to present a host of matchup issues with his vast skill set. Carolina is 17-2 this season when the junior power forward scores 10 points or more. OklahomaBuddy Hield is the best player in college basketball for a laundry list of reasons: Nobody has made more threes (154), nobody draws more attention defensively and nobody has galvanized a team quite like Hield. His 25.5 points per game is second best in America, and yet it's his remarkable efficiency that stands out. Hield is Curryesque when it comes to the college landscape. He converts over 50 percent from the field, 47 percent from distance and 88 percent from the stripe. But what makes OU a real contender is the balance of Lon Kruger's club.Flanking Hield in the backcourt is Jordan Woodard and fellow senior Isaiah Cousins, who switched positions with one another before the season. The 6-foot-4 Cousins is the lead guard now, responsible for running the show and distributing to Hield and Woodard, who himself made a Herculean leap this year. As a sophomore, Woodard made a miserable 25 percent of his 3-point attempts. As a junior, that clip has jumped to 46 percent.As a result, Oklahoma scores about 20 points per game in transition, and has become the second best 3-point shooting team in the country. Kruger is just one of two coaches to take five schools to the tournament, and his willingness to rely on the long ball has been the ultimate coup for the Sooners.VillanovaThe Wildcats know how to win. Their 95 wins over the past three seasons are tops nationally, and don't forget about the three consecutive Big East regular season championships. Villanova features a wonderful defensive group that grinds out late game stops as well as anybody. As a whole, they rank seventh in adjusted defensive efficiency, per KenPom -- and think about the hurt they just put on Kansas, the top overall seed and itself a great offensive team. KU shot just 27 percent from 3 and scored a season-low 59 points. The full-court press that Villanova employs presents a litany of problems. It turns you over and speeds you up.Jay Wright's team, back in the Final Four for the first time since 2009, can also score the ball. Third-Team All-American swingman Josh Hart (15 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists) is a terrific two-way player who creates a ton of offense from the middle of the floor. Senior point guard Ryan Archidacono may be the toughest player Wright has ever coached, and he's playing the best basketball of his career. And 6-foot-6 Kris Jenkins (11-24 from 3 in the tournament) has enjoyed a shooting terror that has extended opposing defenses much farther away from the basket than they would like.

12,WOMEN,Why Utah's Nonsensical New Abortion Bill Is So Bad For Women,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-utahs-nonsensical-new-abortion-bill-is-so-bad-for-women_us_56fab764e4b0a372181b102b,Mandating anesthesia isn't about protecting women -- or their fetuses.,2016-03-30,Utah's new abortion bill is not grounded in science.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fab8de1500002a000b36a5.jpeg?cache=VfDQ0ZqyBm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week Utah's ""adamantly pro-life"" governor signed a bill that makes the state the first in the country to require that every single woman who gets an abortion at or beyond 20 weeks receives anesthesia.At first glance, this may not sound particularly alarming, but it's a bill that has reproductive health experts around the country shaking their heads in disbelief, and it's very bad news for women. Here's why:#1. It isn't based in science. Utah's so-called ""protecting unborn children amendments"" now include the bold (and incorrect) assertion that ""substantial medical evidence from studies concludes that an unborn child who is at least 20 weeks gestational age may be capable of experiencing pain during an abortion procedure."" (This language might as well have been lifted straight from The National Right to Life Committee, the self-proclaimed oldest and largest pro-life organization in the United States.)The Utah bill further asserts that requiring women to have an anesthetic or an analgesic will help prevent fetuses from feeling pain. But in fact, medical evidence clearly refutes the idea that a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks. A sweeping 2005 review on the topic -- in one of the nation's premiere medical journals, written by actual doctors and researchers -- explicitly spelled out that ""fetal anesthesia or analgesia should not be recommended or routinely offered for abortion."" To say nothing of requiring it.""The notion that a fetus can feel pain is not supported by the medical community,"" said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues associate with the Guttmacher Institute in Washington, D.C. ""There is no medical basis for this law.""#2. It's completely nonsensical. And potentially dangerous for women.Trying to make sense of how, exactly, this will all play out for women and abortion care providers is pretty much impossible at this point, precisely because the requirement has no roots in credible science. What does it mean that a woman must receive anesthesia or analgesia? How much? What kind? Who the hell knows.""I don't know exactly what it is asking, and since legislators are legislators and not anesthesiologists, they can't tell us what they are thinking -- nor are they qualified to in that regard,"" said Dr. Anne Davis, consulting medical director of Physicians for Reproductive Health, and assistant professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University.The bill seems to assume there is some kind of fetal anesthesia, and that care providers know how to give it, Davis said, but no such pain medication exists. Women are sometimes given anesthesia during an abortion, but it's on a case-by-case basis, and can range from localized topical applications, to sedation, to general anesthesia in rare cases. And it's to treat her.""Because it's not necessary, it's going to be very difficult for a doctor to try and come up with anything that makes sense,"" Davis argued. Though anesthesia is generally quite safe, it does have risks. ""This is different than telling someone something that's not true; it's giving someone medicine that they don't need...and that has risks,"" Davis continued, referring to laws in certain states that require doctors to read scripts with inflated claims about the risks of abortion care. ""It's highly unethical.""#3. It's a sneaky, back-door way to ban abortion care.Because the new Utah bill puts doctors in the unfair position of having to make sense of a requirement not backed by scientific evidence, not to mention one that carries potentially heavy added costs, experts believe it's effectively a new way to try and ban 20-week abortions -- one other states might try and copy.It's important to note that while most abortions in the U.S. occur before 21 weeks, women who seek them later often do so because of severe fetal abnormalities, or because they've faced major hurdles accessing the abortion care legally afforded them by the Supreme Court.""This law is similar to laws that exist in 12 other states that ban abortion at about 20 weeks fertilization,"" Nash said.

14,POLITICS,Trump’s Tragic Flaw May Finally Send Him Down In Flames,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-women-flames_us_56fc47efe4b0a06d5804b0b4,"""Hindenburg"" Trump is playing with matches.",2016-03-30,Donald Trump is being brought down to earth by his most powerful enemy.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fc4a4c1e00008e01711ccb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has defied the laws of political physics from the moment he rode down that gold-toned elevator in his own Manhattan tower to announce his candidacy last spring.Time and again he’s proved every pundit and all of his fellow Republican candidates wrong, and he remains the only GOP contender with a plausible chance to collect a majority of delegates before the Cleveland convention in July.But after a year of hovering above the skyline like a giant dirigible, Trump is being brought down to earth by his most powerful enemy: his own need to demonstrate his masculine “strength” by disparaging others, particularly women.It has taken a year for relevant, campaign-related examples to accumulate, but they reached critical mass just in time for a pivotal primary in Wisconsin next week that could see the start of a slow, steady decline in his chances.He is simply so unpopular with female voters -- who make up at least 54 percent of the turnout in presidential general elections -- that a victory by him this fall seems all but impossible. In a new NBC News poll, Trump is viewed favorably by only 1 in 5 female voters. To be sure, his ratings among men aren’t dramatically better, and his main GOP rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is almost as poorly regarded by women. Still, 1 in 5 doesn’t work.“He can’t win, and women are a main reason why,” said Charlie Black, a Republican consultant advising Ohio Gov. John Kasich.Trump critics also note that, despite his vow to ferociously attack Hillary Clinton in a general election, his salvos could be countered by Democrats as just another example of his corrosive attitude toward women.There are plenty of examples already: his long-running firefight with Fox anchor Megyn Kelly, which included a veiled reference to menstruation; his high-school-level disparagement of Carly Fiorina’s looks; his vow to “spill the beans” on Cruz’s wife, Heidi; and Trump’s full-throated defense of his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was arrested this week in Florida and charged with using unwanted physical force to yank a female reporter away from his boss.Trump’s own family and close advisers have been worried about Lewandowski’s short fuse and aggressive behavior for months, but Trump is sticking by him in the din.Then, on Tuesday, Trump struck a match to the whole pile, telling MSNBC host Chris Matthews that women who get “illegal” abortions (and Trump wants to make them all illegal) should face “some form of punishment” -- details unspecified.In the hourlong face-to-face interview -- no phone-ins this time -- Matthews pressed Trump on whether he thought abortion should be illegal. The answer was “yes.” So if it is, should women be punished in some way? After hesitating several times, Trump answered “yes.”After meandering around on the issue for years, Trump in the campaign has run as somewhat of a hard-liner: in favor of repealing Roe v. Wade and of banning so-called partial-birth abortions, but not endorsing a human life amendment or a ban on abortions even in cases of rape or incest.But the comments to Matthews took him much further to the right, and away from the mainstream of female voters, 55 percent of whom think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.Minutes after the taping of the show, and the airing of that key excerpt, the Trump campaign tried to walk the comments back, but it was too late. Democrats, liberals and leaders of women’s rights groups attacked with gusto.So did Cruz, though his complaint came from the opposite political direction: that Trump was masquerading as a totalitarian foe of abortion, a role that rightly belongs to the Texan.We’ll know soon enough whether Trump is in trouble, let alone going up in flames, when Wisconsin primary voters go to the polls on Tuesday.The most recent poll, out on Wednesday and taken during the days that the Lewandowski story dominated the political news, showed Trump falling behind Cruz by 10 points.Look out below.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Terry McAuliffe (D) vetoed a bill Wednesday that would have allowed businesses and individuals to cite their religious beliefs as a reason for refusing services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.""We should be pursuing policies to make Virginia a more vibrant and welcoming place to live, work, and raise a family,"" McAuliffe said in a statement. ""Senate Bill 41 would accomplish the opposite by making Virginia unwelcome to same-sex couples, while artificially engendering a sense of fear and persecution among our religious communities. Accordingly, I veto this bill.""Supporters of the bill argued it would protect people's religious freedom.“It is unfortunate that Governor McAuliffe is so willing to discriminate against people of faith who simply disagree with the secular left’s sexual dogma,” Victoria Cobb, president of the Family Foundation of Virginia, said in a statement.The governor said that was hogwash.""This legislation is nothing more than an attempt to stigmatize,"" he said. ""Any additional protections are styled in a manner that prefers one religious viewpoint -- that marriage can only validly exist between a man and a woman -- over all other viewpoints.""McAuliffe's veto comes amid a wave of anti-LGBT bills moving through state legislatures under the guise of religious liberty. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) vetoed a bill Monday that would have allowed organizations to openly discriminate against gay people. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed a sweeping law last week that bans cities from protecting LGBT people and prevents transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity. At least 20 anti-LGBT bills have been introduced in the Texas Legislature.The business community has played a huge role in sinking these bills. In Georgia, for example, Disney and the NFL were threatening to take their business elsewhere if the bill became law. Salesforce tanked a similar measure in Indiana. In North Carolina, where the anti-LGBT law just took effect, 90 big-name businesses signed a letter urging a full repeal. Many aren't based in the state, but they warned that the discriminatory law makes North Carolina a less attractive destination for them.""The business community, by and large, has consistently communicated to lawmakers at every level that such laws are bad for our employees and bad for business,"" reads their letter. ""This is not a direction in which states move when they are seeking to provide successful, thriving hubs for business and economic development."""

It's right up there with security and providing health care for the nation, he told a crowd in Wisconsin Tuesday night. Yet Trump has called for the elimination of the Department of Education, meaning he would destroy the agency responsible for doing what he claims is so important for the country.On Tuesday, Trump appeared at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee, a week before the state's primary election. An attendee asked what he views as the ""top three functions of the United States government.""""The greatest function of all by far is security for our nation. I would also say health care, I would also say education,"" Trump replied. ""There are many many things. But I would say the top three are security, security, security."" Most people on both sides of the aisle would agree that security is a key federal government function. But education and health care are priorities more likely to come from a liberal Democrat than a Republican.Trump has actually been all over the map on the role of the federal government. In October, he said he would cut federal spending by eliminating the Department of Education (and the Environmental Protection Agency), arguing that education is a local issue.""I may cut Department of Education,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I believe Common Core is a very bad thing. I believe that we should be -- you know, educating our children from Iowa, from New Hampshire, from South Carolina, from California, from New York. I think that it should be local education.""States certainly have a role in providing education. But without the Department of Education, the ""United States government"" would be at a significant disadvantage in doing what Trump said it should Tuesday. CNN host Anderson Cooper tried to point out the discrepancy during the Wisconsin town hall.""I want it to go to states, yeah. Absolutely,"" Trump replied, contradicting his earlier comment that education was a key issue of the U.S. government. ""So that's not part of what the federal government's role should be?"" Cooper asked.""Well, the federal government -- But the concept of the country is the concept that we have to have education within the country,"" Trump said. ""We have to get rid of Common Core, and it should be brought to the state level.""Common Core has become a popular conservative target, lambasted as a symbol of federal government intrusion in state policy. In reality, it was developed at the state level, as former George W. Bush aide Tony Fratto pointed out Tuesday night.

The customers who flocked to the exchanges are sick and are using a lot of medical care, a trend that could jeopardize Obamacare's gains by destabilizing the health insurance system.Greater access to health care for people with pre-existing conditions who were shut out of the old market and those whose low incomes made health insurance too expensive before the Affordable Care Act's subsidies became available in 2014 was one of the core goals of the law President Barack Obama enacted six years ago.And health insurance exchanges are growing, with nearly 13 million enrolled as of Jan. 31, when the most recent sign-up period ended. Subsidized coverage from these marketplaces and the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare in 31 states and the District of Columbia are the main reasons why an estimated 20 million more people have health insurance this year than before the Affordable Care Act became law and the uninsured rate declined to a historic low.But the sicker population making up these exchange marketplaces doesn't seem to be getting balanced out by healthier customers who pay into the insurance risk pool without drawing down as much in benefits. Absent that balance, health insurance companies will raise rates further in future years to cover their costs, which could price out consumers -- especially those who are healthy and who need coverage least and thus are the least costly to insure.In key respects, this shouldn't be surprising, and reflects the dire need for health care access that persisted in the pre-Obamacare health care system. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies could turn away people with pre-existing medical conditions, offer them coverage that cost much more than for healthier people, or sell them a policy that expressly didn't cover health problems with which they'd been diagnosed. Others were among the ranks of the uninsured because they couldn't afford health insurance, and being poor is associated with being less healthy. And people in both categories may have had ailments that weren't discovered until they gained coverage and visited medical providers. In addition, people with serious medical conditions previously covered by special ""high-risk pool"" insurance programs transitioned into the regular market.""We're seeing here the consequences of a very complex insurance system and the fact that now, people who need the care have a chance to find the care,"" said Donald Berwick, a physician who founded the Massachusetts-based Institute for Healthcare Improvement who now serves as president emeritus and senior adviser.In the insurance business, it's referred to as ""adverse selection"" when a disproportionate share of expensive customers sign up. Given that the purpose of the Affordable Care Act was to enable more Americans to get health care, Berwick suggested another way of looking at it.""We call it 'adverse selection.' You might call it 'proper selection,' because people who need the care are getting the care,"" said Berwick, who led the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2010 and 2011 during Obama's first term and oversaw early aspects of Affordable Care Act implementation.""What would we want other than that? Would we want these people not to be getting insurance? Of course not. They're the people who need it the most,"" he said. Berwick had not read the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association report, which the industry group shared with news organizations under an embargo in advance of its publication Wednesday.Still, covering all those people and paying for their medical expenses is a financial burden on insurance policyholders and on taxpayers who finance Obamacare's health insurance premium tax credit subsidies, which will cost $43 billion this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a Chicago-based entity that licenses the Blue brand to insurers that covered 8.6 million people in the individual health insurance market as of Dec. 31, reviewed those companies’ claims data from 2014 and 2015 to conclude something is different about the new entrants to the insurance system.The organization found that people with Obamacare coverage are more likely to have chronic medical conditions like HIV, Hepatitis C and diabetes than the customer based they served before Obamacare. Naturally, these customers in the so-called individual market -- comprising the exchanges and people who buy directly from an insurance company or through a broker -- are going to doctors, hospitals, emergency rooms and pharmacies more, too. Average monthly costs per enrollee rose in 2015 above where they were in 2014, suggesting the trend isn't abating.The inability of large players in the insurance industry to make a profit on the health insurance exchanges has raised questions about whether the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate creates a strong enough incentive for healthy people to enroll and whether the price of exchange coverage is too high, especially for those whose incomes are too high to qualify for financial assistance or who are eligible for only small subsidies.These findings are consistent with the financial losses reported by companies including UnitedHealth Group, Anthem, Aetna and Health Care Service Corp. on their exchange business. UnitedHealth Group has publicly weighed pulling out of these marketplaces, and several insurers have cut or halted fees to insurance brokers who send them new customers as a way to reduce their exposure.""There's no question there's a problem. If this persisted, the individual market would become more unstable,"" Berwick said.""It's a problem we need to solve in the context of seeking universality, not in the context of throwing that idea away,"" he said. ""Where do we want go as a nation? Backward, so that these people with diabetes and chronic diseases again find themselves adrift?""The association's report doesn't include calls for changes to federal policy, but Fox emphasized insurers are concerned the Obama administration isn't doing enough to prevent people from gaming the system by using so-called special enrollment periods -- intended for consumers in situations such as moving to a different state or getting married -- to sign up for coverage only after they become ill. Federal authorities have narrowed the circumstances when these special enrollment periods can be used and begun to require documentation, but insurers don't think the new standards are strict enough, Fox said.The government, insurers and medical providers need to work faster at remaking the health care delivery system itself to reduce waste, promote efficiency and better coordinate care, especially people with chronic conditions, Berwick said. The Obama administration has made some strides in these areas using authorities provided by the Affordable Care Act, but whether its initiatives will succeed on a large scale remains an unknown.Private insurers are taking similar steps, Fox said, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association report emphasizes the importance of programs that encourage patients to keep track of their medical conditions.Because so many of the people who signed up for Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 2014 and 2015 are new to health insurance, companies must do better at consumer education and assistance for patients to encourage them, for example, to seek care at a doctor's office rather than a hospital emergency department, Fox said.This story has been updated with information about high-risk pool enrollees joining the health insurance exchanges.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of customers enrolled in Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance plans."

Thanks to an international team of researchers, we now can at least partly explain how this happens: The season you were born in can leave certain ""markers"" on your DNA that may influence your health, said Dr. John Holloway, professor of allergy and respiratory genetics at the University of Southampton in England and a co-author of the new study.""If we can go on to identify what it is about season of birth that causes these changes, this could potentially be modifiable, allowing the development of preventative strategies for allergies,"" he told The Huffington Post.For the study, which was published in the journal Allergy on Tuesday, researchers scanned DNA samples from 367 18-year-olds who were born on the Isle of Wight in England. They analyzed specific markers, called DNA methylation, in the samples, and examined whether different markers could be associated with what time of year a person was born and whether they suffer from any allergic diseases, including asthma and eczema.The researchers then measured how susceptible each person was to developing such allergies and noted which participants reported suffering from hay fever, asthma or eczema when they were 1, 4, 10, and 18 years old, Live Science reported.It turns out that we carry certain DNA markers into adulthood -- and that some are both associated with the season we're born in and whether it's likely we'll develop certain allergies. For example, the researchers linked being born in the fall with an increased risk of eczema. Children born in autumn or winter may have a higher chance of developing asthma, The Telegraph reported.Similar findings emerged when the researchers looked at markers found in a group of 8-year-olds. However, the researchers didn't see the markers when they tested their findings in a group of newborn babies -- which suggests that DNA methylation changes might be a result of a person's environment and not occur while in the womb.""It might sound like a horoscope by the seasons, but now we have scientific evidence for how that horoscope could work,"" Dr. Gabrielle Lockett, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southampton and first author of the study, said in a statement. ""Because season of birth influences so many things, the epigenetic marks discovered in this study could also potentially be the mechanism for other seasonally influenced diseases and traits too, not just allergy.""Last year, for instance, data scientists at Columbia University Medical Center in New York discovered an odd correlation between the month a person was born and their risk of developing not only allergies but also health problems including heart disease, viral infections and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Previous studies have also linked season of birth with the risk of some food allergies.More research is needed to explore these associations, as Holloway said it's unclear why they exist.""It could be, for example, sunlight levels affecting maternal vitamin D levels either when the baby is in utero or in breastmilk after birth. It could be a postnatal effect determined by season of birth -- such as, does the child encounter it’s first winter cold season shortly after birth or after nine months when its immune system is more mature,"" he said. ""Is it something to do with mother’s diet as the nutrient content of our diets have been shown to vary with the season? ... We don’t know, but this is what we hope to go on to find out."""

The probe even found that Newark officers in the specialized drug and gang units stole property and money from citizens and conducted inadequate investigations into those complaints.The findings came just weeks before protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown brought national attention to patterns of unconstitutional policing.At the time the Justice Department released its investigation, Newark had settled three lawsuits that resulted from police officers improperly stopping citizens from recording police activity. While a 2011 guidance letter instructed officers not to arrest individuals simply for recording, the investigation found the department didn't adequately explain when an officer had an excuse to arrest someone recording police activity.The DOJ deal is intended to help end so-called contempt of cop arrests, when police retaliate against individuals engaged in lawful activity by illegally taking them into custody. Newark police officers will be banned from taking action unless an individual violates the law, incites others to violate the law, or ""refuses to comply with an officer's order to observe or record from an alternate location and the bystander's presence would jeopardize crime scene integrity or the safety of the officer, the suspect, or others.""The deal will force Newark to ""ensure that officers do not take any police action in retaliation for individuals lawfully exercising their right to witness, observe, record, comment on, or protest police activity. This includes detaining, searching, arresting, issuing a citation, or using force in response to non-criminal statements or other expressive conduct, when the officer would not have taken such action in the absence of the statements or expressive conduct.""While recording the police is protected activity, police officers don't always treat it that way. In rare cases, illegal arrests of individuals recording police activity have resulted in criminal charges against the officer. A former Connecticut cop was sentenced to prison after he arrested a priest who recorded him and then lied to cover up the unlawful arrest, and a former New York City Police officer was recently indicted for lying about the arrest of an individual who recorded him. Under the deal, Newark police will also have to improve their troubled internal affairs system. The consent decree states that the department will conduct regular ""integrity audits"" to identify officers who refuse to accept or discourage the filing of misconduct complaints, or provide false or misleading information about filing complaints.New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said at a press conference on Wednesday that Newark Police training ""has promoted a view that living or simply being in a high-crime area is, in and of itself, criminally suspicious.""Vanita Gupta, who heads the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, said at a press conference on Wednesday that ""changing policies, improving systems and rebuilding trust in policing will not come easily"" in Newark or anywhere across the country.""Change will not happen overnight. In many ways, the tough, complex and challenging work still lies ahead,"" Gupta said. ""But precisely because of the dedicated leaders in this city – from government, to law enforcement, to the community – I know that we can tackle these challenges."""

Jim Walder, who owns TimberCreek Bed & Breakfast in Paxton, Illinois, was fined more than $80,000 by the Illinois Human Rights Commission on March 29, Reuters is reporting. Walder was ordered to pay $30,000 to Todd and Mark Wathen for emotional distress and $50,000 in fees to their attorneys. In 2011, Walder refused to accommodate a civil union ceremony for the Wathens. In an email he sent to the couple, Walder argued, ""Homosexuality is immoral and unnatural,"" according to The Windy City Times. Todd Wathen said he was ""very happy"" with the outcome of the suit, and told The Springfield News-Gazette that the monetary award ""represents a recognition by the judge that Mark and I suffered a real harm — that we were embarrassed and humiliated.""The Wathens ended up having a civil ceremony on June 4, 2011 in the backyard of their home, but ""it wasn't what we wanted,"" Todd Wathen said. Same-sex marriage was legalized in the state of Illinois in 2014. Meanwhile, Walder released a lengthy statement to The Huffington Post condemning the ruling, writing, ""We may be out of step with an increasingly anti-Christian culture, but we are in compliance with God’s design and that is what ultimately matters.""He continued, ""We are not looking for a fight. But when immoral laws are purposely passed (or deemed constitutional) that blatantly conflict with God’s word and when the heavy hand of government tries to force us as Christians to embrace sinful behavior, we have a moral obligation to resist and stand for Biblical truth.""Walder's comments echoed a statement that appeared on the TimberCreek Bed & Breakfast's official website, according to The Springfield News-Gazette. ""It is not an issue of fairness or equality, but an issue of right and wrong,"" the statement, which appears to have been removed from the site, read. ""We cannot be part of what God condemns.""Walder's full statement can be read below: Evidently religious freedom does not exist within the Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act or the Illinois Religious Freedom and Marriage Fairness Act. Yikes. There’s no telling what will happen next at the TimberCreek Bed & Breakfast, but for a venue that deems itself one of the ""most peaceful places you will ever discover,"" they're certainly causing an unfortunate ruckus.

22,WOMEN,Trump's America Is One Where Women Aren't Trusted,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-michelle-fields-this-is-america-in-2016_us_56fa8707e4b0a372181af179,His callous comments about Michelle Fields are indicative of a much larger problem.,2016-03-30,"Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is seen allegedly grabbing the arm of reporter Michelle Fields in this still frame from video taken March 8, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fbe7251e00009500711c1d.jpeg?cache=BhDg8dC2Tf&ops=crop_2_38_985_660%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Women in this country are largely considered untrustworthy narrators of our own experiences. This is especially true when it comes to women's interactions with men, and even more true for women who say they have been assaulted by men, sexually or otherwise. Former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields said that she was forcefully grabbed and nearly thrown to the ground by Donald Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski at a Trump press conference on March 8. There is eyewitness testimony. There is a photograph of Fields' bruised arm. There is an audio recording and video footage of the alleged assault. And on March 29, Lewandowski was formally charged with battery. Still, Trump isn't convinced Fields is telling the truth.On March 11, Lewandowski tweeted that Fields was ""totally delusional,"" and now Trump, whose campaign has vowed to stick by Lewandowski even if he's found guilty, has resorted to textbook gaslighting and victim-blaming.He suggested that women who are assaulted must scream to make said assault legitimate: “If you’re going to get squeezed, wouldn’t you think she would have yelled out a scream or something if she has bruises on her arm?""Trump's comments are incredibly dangerous, not just to Michelle Fields, who has received a barrage of abuse on social media, but to all women who come forward with allegations of assault.Publicly announcing the innocence of someone who has been accused of assault necessitates we assume the accuser is lying. As writer Aaron Bady beautifully outlined in a 2014 essay for the New Inquiry:The damnably difficult thing about all of this, of course, is that you can’t presume that both are innocent at the same time. One of them must be saying something that is not true. But “he said, she said” doesn’t resolve to “let’s start by assuming she’s lying,” except in a rape culture, and if you are presuming his innocence by presuming her mendacity, you are rape cultured. It works both ways, or should: if one of them has to be lying for the other to be telling the truth, then presuming the innocence of one produces a presumption of the other’s guilt.When women are assaulted, they know in no uncertain terms that the culture they exist in is not on their side. They know that the default attitude towards their claims will be doubt and suspicion. They know people will wonder what they did to ""invite"" the alleged assault. When women who are assaulted choose not to come forward with their allegations, they are often trying to avoid the shitstorm of critique and abuse and re-traumatization that will almost certainly follow them if they go public with their claims. And if they change their minds, and come forward at a later date, they know the public will use that time gap as another justification for why they must be lying.It is this culture that kept Bill Cosby's alleged victims silent for decades. It is this culture that allowed a Canadian judge to criticize alleged victims of Jian Ghomeshi for texting each other, suggesting that the communication might be indicative of ""collusion."" It is this culture that left Luckiest Girl Alive author Jessica Knoll unable to use the word ""rape"" in regards to her gang rape for years. It is this culture that created an atmosphere in which Fields felt so unsupported that she left her job.I have written before about how as a presidential candidate, Trump's misogyny legitimizes misogyny writ large, giving people permission to hate women. In the same vein, his remarks about assault give people permission to ignore women who come forward about violence they have endured at the hands of men. As EMILY’s List Communications Director Marcy Stech said in a statement:Nothing says ‘cherish women’ like questioning a woman’s motive after her assault has been caught on camera. The leader of the Republican Party has repeated over and over again that ‘no one is a bigger supporter of women’ -- but today’s incident underscores Trump’s decades-long record of offensive and misogynistic behavior that gets at the core of his being.Welcome to Trump's America. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
23,POLITICS,Anthony Weiner Thinks Donald Trump Is As Doomed As He Was,Sam Stein and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-weiner-donald-trump_us_56faf7bce4b083f5c605efe3,You can't win if you're this disliked.,2016-03-30,Anthony Weiner says Donald Trump's presidential run is oddly reminiscent of his own New York City mayoral campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fafa161e000095007119c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) is pretty sanguine about the Democratic Party's chances in a general election should Donald Trump become the Republican Party's nominee. Unlike the labor wing of the party, which worries about Trump's appeal to working-class white voters, and operatives who fear a scorched-earth campaign, Weiner says the real estate tycoon's inherent flaws will ultimately doom his candidacy. Put simply, Trump's campaign reminds Weiner of his own race for mayor of New York City in 2013.""Donald Trump, if he’s the nominee, with 65 percent negatives, is not going to be our president,"" Weiner said. ""I just know that that’s the case. I had that problem.""In the latest episode of our ""Candidate Confessional"" podcast, Weiner twice drew parallels between Trump's campaign and his own. In 2013, Weiner entered his primary in a similar position to Trump: He was a flawed candidate who benefited from running in a crowded field. ""When you're in a five-way race, having 40 percent negatives is not disqualifying. ... [as] Donald Trump will attest,"" he said. So far, Trump has largely overcome moments when it seemed like his candidacy would implode. He's managed to win races even as the Republican field has thinned out. But a clean delegate win still isn't a sure bet, and the party is belatedly consolidating around Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Weiner, who was ultimately undone after news surfaced that he'd sent more explicit texts than he'd previously acknowledged, believes that reality will catch up with Trump. There was no massive negative ad blitz at the end of Weiner's mayoral campaign -- at that point, he was too far down in the polls to matter. But Weiner can easily envision one that targets Trump, because like Weiner, he provides easy targets. That ad campaign, Weiner imagines, would be crippling. ""It’s funny, I hadn’t thought till right this moment about how many Trump parallels there are to [my] race,"" Weiner said. ""This is the second time his race has come up. It’s kind of instructive."""
24,HEALTHY LIVING,The FDA Just Updated 90s-Era Guidelines For The Abortion Pill,Erin Schumaker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medical-abortion-policy-us-fda_us_56fc0a50e4b0a06d58046731,This will make a huge difference for women in states with abortion restrictions.,2016-03-30,"The FDA updated its recommendations for use on the drug Mifeprex's label, which is part of an abortion pill regimen available to women early in pregnancy. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fc1b011e00009500711c8b.jpeg?cache=VajyExZtRJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday loosened its requirements and prescription protocol for medical abortion, a category of non-surgical abortions that are induced by taking prescribed medication early in a pregnancy. The updated guidelines now allow women to take the medication 21 days later into a pregnancy, increasing the allowable window from 49 days from last menstrual period to 70 days from last menstrual period. The FDA also decreased the dosage of one of the drugs on the market that medical societies previously criticized as being too high.And in most states, the number of doctor's visits women will have to make in cases of medical abortion is reduced from three to two, according to The New York Times.Medical abortion is different than a surgical abortion, in which the fetus is removed using a vacuum, syringe or spoon device, and different than taking emergency contraception -- also called the morning-after pill -- that prevents pregnancy from occurring in the first place. Medical abortions account for about a quarter of all abortions, according to 2011 data from the Guttmacher Institute. Many doctors were already prescribing medical abortions using the new criteria before the change (this is known as off-label use), largely because the guidelines were based on what many medical professionals considered to be outdated clinical evidence from the 1990s. However, some states, including Ohio, Texas and North Dakota, still required doctors to follow the regimen on the pill's packaging, which means that a move as simple as updated FDA labeling can make a major difference in the lives of women in states with anti-abortion laws.   “We have actually had the protocols approved today in place at Planned Parenthood for some time,” Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. “But given the restrictions on medication abortion enacted at the state level in recent years, updating the label to reflect best medical practice represents a significant step forward for science, for women, and for health care providers who want to give our patients the highest quality care.”The reduction in the number of required doctor's visits for medical abortion could help improve access especially for women who live in rural areas, where providers are sparse. In fact, according to a 2008 survey published in the Journal of Women's Health, 31 percent of women living in rural areas traveled more than 100 miles to get an abortion.Access in states with abortion restrictions is also particularly limited. Some 63 percent of all abortions in America are performed in clinics, but Mississippi, South Dakota and North Dakota each have only one operational abortion clinic, reports a study published this month in JAMA Internal Medicine. Wyoming doesn't have a single clinic, and in 2011 only had three total abortion providers. The growing use of telemedicine, or doctor's visits conducted online, could improve access even further, the JAMA authors noted.“Currently, more than half of rural women don’t have access to reproductive health services anywhere in their county,” Katy Kozhimannil, a health policy researcher at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health who wasn’t involved in the study, told Reuters. Of course, it's likely that the gridlocked abortion climate in the U.S. will hinder the expansion of medical abortions via telemedicine. At the very least, updated abortion pill labels are a step in the right direction."

Wambach and Rapinoe dropped their landmark decision during a discussion on Ohio State's campus regarding women's rights, gay rights and Wambach's October retirement.Wambach, a deadly header of the ball during her playing days (she scored 67 goals with her head for the USWNT), suffered one of the most infamous concussions in women's soccer history in April 2013. After being hit hard by a ball during a National Women's Soccer League match, her team failed to immediately examine her condition and for 11 days didn't admit that she was at risk for a concussion -- failings that U.S. Soccer eventually apologized for. The pair's decision follows former USWNT World Cup-winner Brandi Chastain's March 3 pledge to donate her brain for chronic traumatic encephalopathy research, better known as CTE, a degenerative brain condition that's been linked to repetitive hits to the head. While Chastain, 47, Wambach and Rapinoe won't have their brains studied anytime soon -- CTE can only be diagnosed after death -- their decisions, as the most high-profile female athletes to pledge, could help inspire other women to donate their brains for concussion research. Out of over 300 brains currently in Dr. Ann McKee's brain bank, only seven are from women. Despite representing 50 percent of the population, no woman has ever been diagnosed with CTE -- a stark indicator of the gender gap in concussion research. Dr. Angela Colantonio, the Director of the Rehabilitation Sciences Institute at the University of Toronto, said at the first annual International Summit On Female Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) that of the 200 TBI studies she's analyzed, only 7 percent contained sex-specific data, according to ThinkProgress. The need for research is there. NCAA's chief medical officer Dr. Brian Hainline has said that female college athletes in soccer, softball and basketball have up to three times a greater risk for a concussion than their male counterparts. Not only are the chances of a concussion statistically higher for female athletes, but the stakes are too: Dr. Jessica Gill, a researcher at the National Institute of Health, said at TBI that women have higher levels of tau (the brain protein scientists look for in diagnosing CTE) after a concussion. The biological factors between men and women, including brain size, blood flow, hormone levels and neck strength all make it clear that male concussion research cannot serve as like-for-like information for women. The worrisome reports from TBI hopefully spur a moral initiative for more female athletes to pledge their brains, because as of today, there just aren't enough to study. Chastain, Wambach and Rapinoe are all World Cup winners and superstars in women's sports. Their influence over women of all sports and athletes of all ages is vast and incalculable, but invaluable nonetheless.Their March pledges to donate will undoubtedly shape the future of how female brains are impacted by blows to the head, but until a test to diagnose CTE in the living is conceived, dividends from their decisions won't be seen for decades -- a fact that current female athletes can ill afford to play through."
