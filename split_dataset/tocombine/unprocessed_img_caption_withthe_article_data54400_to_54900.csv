0,THE WORLDPOST,Afghanistan's Women-Only Coding School Breaks Gender Barriers,"Wadia Samadi, Women & Girls Hub",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/afghanistan-women-coding-school_us_575eccf3e4b0ced23ca8a767,"A new female-only coding school is helping launch a quiet revolution in Afghanistan, where computers are opening up the world",2016-06-13,"Women learn computer skills in Anjil, Herat province, west of Kabul, Afghanistan.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575ecff215000030001b9183.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new female-only coding school is helping launch a quiet revolution in Afghanistan, where computers are opening up the world to women and allowing them to escape decades of repression.When Fereshteh Forough graduated with a degree in computer science from Herat University, she knew she was an exception to the rule.When she moved to Afghanistan one year after the fall of the Taliban after a childhood in Iran, Forough was well aware she had already overcome many challenges to get an education – and would face many more as she looked for a job.The Taliban Islamic fundamentalist movement took power in Afghanistan in 1996. This marked the start of a catastrophic time for Afghan women’s rights. Under the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Sharia law, women who once attended co-ed schools, worked in offices, drove cars, traveled unaccompanied by men – and even wore miniskirts – were forced to stay home and required to wear the burqa.In 2001, the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan released the Taliban’s grip on the country, but the group’s rule had a lasting impact on people’s perception of women’s capabilities. In terms of job opportunities for women, teaching in an all-girls school is a considered respectable option; any field that involves working alongside men is frowned upon.But Forough always knew women were just as capable as men. So, after completing her master’s degree from the Technical University of Berlin, she came home and opened Afghanistan’s first all-female coding school, Code to Inspire (CTI).“When we started recruiting girls in Herat in the fall of 2015, we wanted to show them their value and empower them to break down traditional barriers,” Forough said.Under the eye of the international community and with budding support from the Afghan government, many Afghan women are taking their chance to challenge the social and economic restrictions that the Taliban left behind. Currently, 85 percent of women in Afghanistan are illiterate, with no formal education. But a survey by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) found that 80 percent of Afghan women now have access to mobile technology, either through their own phone or one belonging to a family member.Forough is one of the few women to join Afghanistan’s emerging technology sector. Her coding school trains 50 girls and teaches elementary web design, along with mobile app development. She believes that her school – a recipient of the Google Rise Award for nonprofits promoting computer science education – makes her students self-reliant, upgrades their status in society and broadens their perspectives because it gives them access to the rest of the world.“These women have better chances to find jobs based on their skills,” Forough said. “As women earn income and support their families, their communities will gradually realize the value of working women. The man who abuses his wife or daughter at home may begin to see and treat her differently.”In a country where only a few years ago the internet, television and even music were banned, many see the growing number of women in technology as a hopeful sign of progress.“Technology provides women with a unique opportunity to learn, work and have sustainable livelihoods, regardless of geographical location, age or gender,” says Omar Mansoor Ansari, president of TechNation, an I.T. services firm in Kabul. “This is what women in Afghanistan are gradually realizing, and more and more girls are joining tech.”Not only does a career in computers offer Afghan women financial independence, it also gives them the chance to work from home. That’s a key reason many women are attracted to the tech field and, crucially, why many families support their daughters’ involvement with it.Around the country, companies and institutions are recognizing the benefits of helping women get into tech. TechNation provides a number of programs to teach women coding and expand their entrepreneurial capabilities. One of the firm’s initiatives isTechWomen Afghanistan, a network of 150 members that regularly organizes coding workshops and events. Each year, more than 100 young women aged 12–18 participate in Technovation Afghanistan,a global challenge in which contestants create mobile phone apps and learn how to launch startups. And TechDera, a community technology center based in Kabul, provides women with training in mobile app design, web development and Java programming.For many Afghan women, technology has transformed their lives. As a programmer, TechNation communications assistant Shakiba Ibrahimkhail has the freedom to choose where and when she wants to work, and the types of projects she wants to work on. “Coding can help me be my own boss,” she says.Forough wants to help more women feel that way. Her plan for CTI in the next year is to enroll more students, expand to other cities and continue developing mobile apps for education and games, for providing health tips and raising awareness about women’s issues in the country.“Sometimes as an outsider, it can be scary to think about programming and coding as potential careers,” Forough said when asked for her advice to girls who want to learn to code. “But don’t be afraid of challenges. They make you stronger and give you perspective in life. And once you learn, you will see how coding is so empowering.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

In a statement on the campaign page, the organization stated that it's working with a ""team of attorneys and experts"" to distribute the funds. One partner is the National Center for Victims of Crime, which helped distribute funds to victims and their families after previous mass shootings in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Aurora, Colorado.The campaign's stated goal is $5 million, double its original goal of $2.5 million. The goal was raised after GoFundMe saw the rate at which individuals were donating money.There has been an outpouring of volunteer and charity support after the weekend's shooting, which left 49 dead and 53 injured. Orlando's Pulse club, where the attack occurred was a center of gay nightlife, and the nation's LGBTQ community has come together to grieve and send support to Orlando.Orlando-area blood banks were reportedly ""overwhelmed"" by people wanting to donate blood in response to the tragedy, and have even asked potential donors to schedule appointments because their facilities were totally at capacity. ""Through our grief and through our tears, what remains absolutely constant is our unshakable resolve that we will uproot the bigotry, the fear and the hatred that is at the core of this horror we are enduring,"" Equality Florida posted on its Facebook page.

8,QUEER VOICES,The Orlando Massacre: A Reminder of the Dangers LGBT People Live With Every Day,Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orlando-pulse-shooting-lgbt-dangers_us_575d6615e4b0e39a28add385,"There have been scores of attacks on LGBT spaces, some of which received more attention than others.",2016-06-12,Hate crimes against LGBT people haven’t dissipated since the arrival of marriage equality and have in fact been on the rise in recent years.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575d745b2200002d00f8079c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Pride month night of celebration and fun -- the weekly Latin Night at the popular Orlando club, Pulse, focused on Latin music, performances and dancing -- turned into a morning of mass death and devastation. But the brutal reality that jarred Orlando's LGBT community, and the entire nation, is something that LGBT people have always experienced, as gay and lesbian bars and clubs have been targeted consistently by those who harbor hate toward LGBT people.And it's a reminder of the animus against LGBT people that still exists, and the ever present danger with which we still live.There have been scores of attacks on LGBT spaces, some of which received more attention than others. Eric Rudolph, also known as the Olympic Park Bomber because of his terror attack on the Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta in 1996, also targeted lesbian bars, in addition to abortion clinics. In 1997, he targeted the Otherside Lounge, a lesbian bar in Atlanta, with two bombs, one of which detonated in the bar and injured five people. (The second bomb, found in a parking lot of the bar, was detonated by police without injury.) Rudolph, associated with the extremist Army of God, later pleaded guilty and said he was targeting homosexuality.In 2014, Musab Masmari was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for setting fire to a Seattle gay nightclub on New Year’s Eve in 2013. The assistant U.S. attorney reported that one of Masmari’s friends said Masmari confided in him that he ""‘burned a gay club’ and that he did it because ‘what these people are doing is wrong.'” Another person close to Masmari reportedly said he had a “general hostility towards homosexuality.” Just last fall, there were a series of unsolved attacks against gay men exiting gay bars and venues in Dallas. One man was dragged into a van, beaten with a baseball bat while being called a ""fag,"" and dropped off a few blocks away. During the same time period three gay bars in Dallas were vandalized as well.And hours after the Orlando mass-shooting, it was reported that police in Santa Monica found a cache of weapons and chemicals in the car of James Wesley Howell, an Indiana man whom they said was headed to LA Pride. It was apparently unrelated to the Orlando shooting, and details were still coming in. Hatred against LGBT people is clearly something we’ve lived with for decades, and even in these days of big victories we see a ferocious backlash playing out which is also motivated by bigotry. Many of us often take for granted the freedoms we’ve won, and certainly we don't think twice about going out for a good time, dancing and enjoying ourselves -- and we might not want to think about the dangers that still face LGBT people. And the American media, too, seems complacent; early on major news organizations reporting on this mass shooting, like The New York Times and CNN, weren't reporting the fact that Pulse is a gay club, or were downplaying that fact -- a relevant fact, especially as this increasingly looks like a terror attack or hate crime.Hate crimes against LGBT people haven’t dissipated since the arrival of marriage equality and have in fact been on the rise in recent years. What we've learned from his father about the Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, is that he was recently repulsed -- became ""very angry"" -- upon seeing two gay men kissing in Miami. Whatever his other beliefs or allegiances, that bedrock of homophobia is part of what drove him to carry out a brutal mass-shooting. This terrible tragedy is a reminder of the threat of violence against LGBT every day, and why we must always remain vigilant."
9,QUEER VOICES,"It's 2016 And Two Men Kissing Is Still A Stunning, Terrifying Sight",Noah Michelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/two-men-kissing_us_575d7ea0e4b0e39a28add79f,Just existing as a queer person is still a radical --and very dangerous -- act.,2016-06-12,"Friends and family members embrace outside the Orlando Police Headquarters during the investigation of a shooting at the Pulse night club, where as many as 20 people have been injured after a gunman opened fire, in Orlando, Florida.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575d9cdf2200002d00f807d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I woke up this morning to a call telling me that a mass shooting had taken place at a queer club in Orlando. The details were -- and still are -- few and far between, but what we do know is that a 20-something man killed 50 people and injured at least 53 others. On my television, a mother whose son is still missing sobbed in the street in front of the club. On my Twitter feed, politicians and celebrities offered their prayers. Some called for gun control. Some blamed Islam. Some blamed political correctness. Though the shooter reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIS, his father issued a statement claiming that religion played no part in the motivation for the shooting but, instead, it was allegedly the sight of two men kissing months ago that may have set him off.We don't know exactly why he did it and we may never know.What we do know -- what I've known my entire life -- is that the sight of two men kissing is a stunning, terrifying thing. A dangerous thing. A thing that inspires fury and fear and violence and, yes, murder. Even today, even living in New York City, one of the most accepting cities in the world, I think twice before holding another man's hand or kissing another man's face. I don't want to -- every time I do it I internally recoil a bit at my own reaction. And then I take a deep breath and take my date's hand. Or I push my lips towards my friend's lips when we're saying ""goodnight."" It's a simple act -- a moment -- but even twenty years after I first came out, I feel the terror swarming me because I do not know what might happen.I don't want to think of myself as brave any time I kiss another man. I want to simply enjoy that moment of connection with another person. When I realize that's not a luxury I'm afforded because I'm queer, I'm crestfallen. I'm furious. And I'm reminded that just existing as a queer person is still a radical act and every public (and even private) affirmation of my identity is still revolutionary. Because even after all of the victories the queer community has seen in recent years, even after securing marriage equality for all people in The United States, even after more visibility in Hollywood and on sports teams, here we are: forced to face the fact that we are still misunderstood and hated for nothing more than who we are, who we love, who we fuck and how we live our lives.We can pass all the laws we can to secure our equal rights and still, none of it matters when fundamentally we are still seen as less than, other than, sick, deviant, twisted, immoral and evil. I'm trying to imagine what it must be like to see two human beings exchange a brief intimate moment and respond with disgust. How does someone get programmed to react that way? And how do we deprogram them and our culture?I don't have all the answers. But today isn't about answers. And today isn't just a day for thoughts and prayers (which, of course, help many people cope) but it's a day for outrage and anger and remembering the role that those emotions have played in where we have come from, how we got to where we are and where we are going. Here we stand in the middle of Pride Month, a month dedicated to remembering all of those who came before us and fought so that our lives could be better, our love could be brighter, and in the face of hate we must continue down that road. So how do we do that? As I write this, I'm sending texts and emails to the people in my life that I love and I suggest you start by doing the same thing. Then, share photos of yourself kissing whomever you love (or like or just find sexy or smart or kind). Go and find someone new to kiss. Come out. Come out. Come out. Talk about who you are, what you've been through, what your life is like. Be sex positive. Be vocal. Read and share the stories of those who came before you. Donate to relief funds. If you can donate blood, do it. If you can't, speak out about how offensive and outdated regulations against queer men donating blood are. Support trans people. Call your elected officials and tell them you won't standby while even one more anti-queer law is passed. Teach your children and your friend's children and your neighbor's children about what it means to be queer. Fight HB2. Speak out against radical religious officials and politicians who spread anti-queer hate. Have sex. Be a role model for a queer teen. Donate to a queer homeless youth center.

But now, a Republican Senator is urging people to hold off. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) encouraged his colleagues on Sunday to withhold their endorsements of Donald Trump as a means of maintaining leverage over the presumptive Republican nominee.Appearing on CBS’ ""Face the Nation,"" Flake said he was horrified by recent statements from Trump and that he lacked confidence that the real estate tycoon would “turn the corner” in terms of his temperament.In order to facilitate that change, Flake suggested that his fellow Republican senators simply not offer their support -- a fairly remarkable bit of subterfuge directed at their own party’s presidential candidate.""So I hope that a number of us at least will withhold endorsement, I've not endorsed, until we see,” said Flake, according to a transcript provided by the show. “It's not a comfortable position to not support your nominee of the party. None of us want to be in this position. But there are certain things that you can't do as a candidate. And some of the things he's done, I think, are beyond the pale.""Trump had managed to make some inroads with Republican leadership after securing the nomination, with House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) reluctantly backing his candidacy despite the obvious pains it caused them. But Trump's recent time on the trail, during which he claimed an American judge with Mexican heritage couldn’t objectively try a case involving him, caused a number of other Republican lawmakers to back away. One, Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.,) retracted his endorsement. And now Flake is encouraging the fence-sitters to hold tight.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The place was crowded. Everyone was having fun, said Cheresse Young, a resident DJ at the nightclub who has worked there for five years.Young left the club around 1:30 a.m. Sunday, less than an hour before a gunman, whom police identified as Omar Mateen, stormed the club. He killed 50 people and injured 53 others before being shot and killed by police. She awoke to the news.""We don't know why he chose our club,"" she told The Huffington Post. ""The club is totally safe. ... We don't need a lot of security and we only have three to four security guys and that's it. It's a safe space and everyone knows that.""Young said she knows two of the bartenders who were shot and is waiting to hear updates on their condition.Other Pulse employees, including manager Neema Bahrami, kept loved ones updated by posting on social media. One man described being inside the club at the time of the attack and seeing people lower themselves to the floor to escape through a back exit. Another posted on Twitter that he was anxiously awaiting news about missing friends. A harrowing 44-second YouTube video shared by Mitchell Wiggs captured sounds of gunshots and sirens outside the club. It later cut to video of victims on the ground receiving care from emergency personnel.One person on Facebook posted that he and a group of friends were sitting near the club's entrance when they decided to leave -- seconds before the gunman arrived and opened fire. That same patron posted a video of ambulances responding to the scene. ""They are just pulling people out in stretchers loading them up,"" he wrote. ""Omg please god let everyone make it - tonight was supposed to be a fun night!! One more minute and we would of been shot or worse.. Thank god we got to our car in time.""There were more than 300 people inside the club when the gunman entered and opened fire, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. That means close to one-third of the people inside were either wounded or killed.Hours later, many family members are still searching for their loved ones and holding out hope that they are alive. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer announced a special hotline for anyone with a loved one who could be a victim: (407) 246-4357. The City of Orlando is also continually updating a victims list.Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) has asked for a moment of silence across the country at 6 p.m. ""to mourn the loss of life and also to pray for those who are still fighting for their life.""Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi also issued a stern warning to anyone considering violence.""Anyone who attacks our LGBT community, anyone who attacks anyone in our state, will be gone after to the full extent of the law,"" she said. ""We need to look out for each other, we need to take care of each other and we will be available as a community, as a state.""Pulse was readying to celebrate its 12th anniversary in July and was actively involved in fundraising for AIDS research and to help sick people with their medical bills. The nightclub, one of only a few major gay clubs in the central Florida region, is especially popular among younger members of the LGBT community but prides itself on being ""a safe space whether you're gay or straight,"" Young said. She urged everyone to stand in solidarity with the queer community. ""Just continue to pray for us because this is something that no one wants to happen,"" she said. ""In the gay community, we're already trying to battle and fight for everything and this is the last thing that we need to battle.""Melissa, an Orlando native who used to frequent Pulse before moving to New York, said the nightclub holds a special place in her heart. (She asked that her last name be withheld.)""As a genderqueer and bisexual individual growing up in Orlando, Pulse truly was a place of refuge for me in a very confusing time,"" she said in an email. ""Many of my friends growing up saw Pulse as a safe place to find ourselves free from the judgement we faced elsewhere. It's difficult to explain to someone who is not from Orlando just how important Pulse was to the city's LGBT community, but I can tell you that if not for the nights I had at Pulse, I would not be the same person I am today - and I know I am not alone in this feeling."""

Months after the Newtown shooting, the Senate tried but failed to pass a measure expanding background checks on firearm purchases.

I can see already the divide between Republicans and Democrats: Islamic Terrorism or Mental Health vs. Gun Control.But, let’s talk about what’s really going on here: whether it is a terrorist act via ISIS (Daesh) or whether it’s a random occurrence via mental health or easy access to assault weapons in the United States—it is a hate crime.It is a hate crime that has sparked outrage, sadness, and anger across the country, but especially in New York City, where LGBT rights have always—always—been at the forefront of equal rights.From 5 Ave and Park Ave, to bars on Greenwich Ave—all the way to Stonewall Inn in the West Village—tears and hugs and apologies have pulled us all together in solidarity as a community.

""Look, I am the father of four daughters,"" Burns said. ""If someone tells you they've been sexually assaulted, take it effing seriously and listen to them.""The comment elicited a large round of applause from the audience in Stanford Stadium. Burns referenced a letter written by a woman who was sexually assaulted on the Stanford campus in January 2015 by Brock Turner, who was then a freshman at the university. The letter, which Turner's victim read aloud at his sentencing this month, circulated widely and drew international attention to the case. Turner received a six-month jail sentence for three felony counts of sexual assault, a sentence most people have called far too lenient.""Maybe someday we will make the survivor's eloquent statement as important as Dr. King's letter from a Birmingham jail,"" Burns said. (The 1963 letter from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. proclaimed a moral responsibility to use nonviolent activism to overturn racist Jim Crow laws.)Graduates, meanwhile, carried signs at commencement standing in support with Turner's victim and decrying how the California university has handled sexual violence among students. In recent years, students protested Stanford's survey of campus sexual assault, which they called skewed, and instances where they said the university was too lenient with students who committed assault.Over 130,000 people have signed an online petition in the past week calling on Stanford to apologize to Turner's victim for the assault that took place on the university's campus. Activists have not accused Stanford of mishandling Turner's case but said in recent days they believe the school could be doing more to assist the woman and reform university policies. ""They never publicly apologized to the survivor, the university never offered her accommodations like counseling services,"" Matthew James Baiza, a Stanford undergraduate who started the petition, told The Huffington Post. ""It's important because if we're going to try to show our university supports survivors, then when the legal system has found the perpetrator guilty, it should take those steps.""Stanford, for its part, said in a statement last week that there is ""still much work to be done, not just here, but everywhere, to create a culture that does not tolerate sexual violence in any form and a judicial system that deals appropriately with sexual assault cases.""_______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter focusing on higher education and sexual violence and is based in New York.

Early Sunday, the LGBTQ nightclub became the scene of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, with at least 50 people dead and 53 injured. Authorities say the suspected shooter, Omar Mateen, stormed the downtown club around 2 a.m. before taking dozens of people hostage and killing dozens more. For Orlando's LGBTQ community, Pulse was a place to go and ""get lost from all the crap in the world,"" said Blue Star, an LGBTQ-friendly business owner and co-founder of the cancer survivor charity The Barber Fund.""When you get in those doors, terrorism doesn’t matter, discrimination doesn’t matter,"" Star said. “It was a place to be free, period. Just be free.” As one of the premier clubs in Orlando's small but close-knit LGBTQ community, Pulse offered more than entertainment and escape, according to Gia Gunn, a former ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" contestant who performed multiple times at the nightclub. ""If you’re questioning your sexuality or your gender ... Pulse is one of those places in Orlando that created a safe environment for people to come and be themselves,"" Gunn said. She described Pulse as a haven for entertainers honing their art as well as for those ""who didn’t have a safe place at home or a comfortable environment to express themselves.""Parliament House, an LGBTQ club that has been in Orlando for 40 years, shared customers, employees, entertainers and philanthropic efforts with Pulse, according to Parliament’s assistant beverage manager Dan Schwab.Schwab ticked off a list of groups Pulse supported or raised money for, including AIDS patients, LGBTQ youth and Hurricane Katrina victims.""[Pulse] is not just a nightclub, a place to go out; it’s a place to get community support and find resources you need,"" he said. Pulse's ethos stemmed from its founding purpose. Co-founder Barbara Poma formed the club in 2004 as a tribute to her brother John, who died of AIDS 13 years before. The club's name is a nod to John's heartbeat, according to an information page for Pulse. ""[Barbara] built that place to give the community a place to go to be free and be happy. It was built out of love and respect for the community,"" said Star, a longtime friend of Poma. ""It was a place for wayward souls to kind of find their way in a safe environment.""Star noted that Pulse was also a major supporter of The Barber Fund.""This act of violence was done on good people -- very good people,"" Star said. Gunn said that while Pulse's legacy of openness and love will endure, some of the carefree spirit has been replaced by worry. ""I feel for gay clubs in general. Is it going to be a thing? Let’s target all gay clubs?"" she said. ""There’s a lot of hate out there."" Nina Golgowski contributed reporting. "

And I receive so much more than I give. I realize I shouldn't have a favorite but I do. Ruth (not her real name) is my favorite. I've been visiting her every week for more than three years. We have become incredibly close. I love her and from what I can tell, she loves me, too. She doesn't remember my name, doesn't remember that I come every Thursday, but her face always lights up when she sees me. She knows I'm someone she loves to visit with.We always hug when I leave. Then I say, ""See you later,"" and she says, ""Alligator!""For most of the time Ruth has been very alert and ""with it."" It's just her memory that has been bad. For example, one day she had some cookies and asked me if I wanted one. I pointed to my ample tummy and asked, ""Do I look like I need a cookie?"" She answered without missing a beat. ""Oh, you're just settling!"" We both had a good laugh about that.Ruth has always loved to dance and is wild about big band music. We have often listened to it together when I visit. She is positively radiant. She tells me she was a good dancer but that her husband was so bad he just stomped out a two-step. She moves her legs up and down lively when she says that. Once she added, ""He was so bad he must have learned to dance in a barn!""Ruth also loves dogs and I sometimes take my little Shih Tzu, Christina, to visit. Ruth is in heaven when Christiana comes. After the first visit with Christina, Ruth proclaimed, ""This is my best day since I've lived here!""Although she's nearly 90 she has always been in perfect physical health. She doesn't even need to wear glasses. At one point the physical therapist tried to get her to use a walker, but she adamantly refused. She said of the idea, ""That's bull *&^#!"" I was shocked at her language. She'd never said anything like that before!Then a few months ago Ruth had a downturn and was often quite confused when I visited. Sometimes she made no sense at all. This was very sad for me, but I just agreed with whatever she said. She knew what she was saying and I pretended to understand it, too. She's always been happy with these 'conversations.'Around that time, she started crying when I left. I have found she is less upset if I tell her I have to take Christina to the vet.Then the most horrible thing happened. Last month Ruth fell and broke her hip. I know that when people that age have a bad fall and break a leg or a hip, they may never recover from it and can pass away shortly thereafter.Since the accident, when I visit Ruth now she makes absolutely no sense. But she's still delighted to see me. She grabs my hand and squeezes it tightly. She looks up at me from her wheelchair with a plaintive expression on her face. She won't let go of my hand.I'm always sorry when I have to disengage my hand and leave. And I'm distressed that she may pass away sooner than if she hadn't broken her hip. That she may be gone soon. Visiting the facility will never be the same without Ruth, and I will always remember her with deep sadness and love.

Why pay full price when you can get a sweet deal from a seller. Everyone needs to save some money on purchases every now and again. Getting the best deal seems to be hard-wired inside of us. However, sometimes a good deal on the product you really need is hard to come by. If you don't attempt to get a lower price, you could end up paying much more than you had originally planned. Here are some tips to help you get the best deals on the items you need the most.Black Friday Sales: There are sales and then there are Black Friday Sales. Originating in the United States, Black Friday Sales promise huge savings on a vast array of items. The word ""black"" refers to the store's emergence from the ""red"" (losses) and its return to profitability"". Black Friday signifies the beginning of the Holiday (Christmas) shopping period and is held on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Although Black Friday sales originated in the United States, similar deals have popped up all over the world that now coincide with the original. During Black Friday sales, items are offered for sale at both traditional brick and mortar stores as well as on the internet. In the days leading up to the sale, companies will publish a list of the sale items in the newspapers and on their websites. Brick and mortar stores will open as early as 5 a.m. on the day while at online stores sales may begin at midnight. Therefore, if you plan to shop at the physical store, you should arrive early and expect a crowd. In addition to this, heavily discounted items are severely limited.Honey: Honey is an app that you can use to get you better deals while you shop online. The app saves you from having to search for coupon codes on your own. Once, installed, the app searches for and applies discount codes to your shopping cart. Honey works with well over 100 stores, from Amazon to Macy's to Home Depot. This means that, if one is available, there is a good chance that you can find a coupon code that you will find useful.

From its days as a fledgling company in 1995, eBay has evolved into the world leader in online auctions. The list of products offered on eBay is vast. You can find anything on the site from houses to cars to stamps and everything in between. All that is required of you is to create an account and verify your payment details. eBay has three modes of purchasing. You can bid on auctions. However, bidding requires some time and patience and may cause you to spend more money than you initially wanted to. You can also purchase an item immediately with the ""Buy it Now"" price, which is a much more convenient alternative. Lastly, you can use eBay's ""Best Offer"" tool to negotiate a deal. The Best Offer tool allows buyers to make a tender to sellers. Retailers are free to accept or decline the offer.Craigslist: Craigslist is an online classified ad service that has expanded to several countries around the globe. It allows you to sell and purchase a number of goods and services at reasonable prices. Ads on the site are classified by location so you can find deals that are close to you. To have the best chance of finding the item you want, use multiple keywords when searching. Craigslist also features a free section which can be hit or miss. Most of these free items will simply be left at the curb for any interested parties. Don't bother trying to reserve the item since this is not the way it works. Instead, free items are available on a first-come, first, serve basis. It is important to remember that purchasing items on Craigslist means meeting the seller face to face to facilitate the transaction. Understandably, this type of interaction can be dangerous since you don't know the seller, don't know whether or not they will have the product for sale, and don't know if they have good intentions for you. Therefore, approach each deal with extreme caution. Insist on meeting the seller at a public place. Many police stations now offer a spot on their premises where individuals can conduct these types of transactions in safety. Lastly, do not give out more personal information than is possible. You can never be sure how such personal information will be used.Price-matching: Online retail can be a harsh, cut-throat business. With so many different companies vying for your dollar, it becomes a competition to get you to spend your money with them. Brick and mortar stores have increasingly found themselves losing out to online retailers. As a result, many of them offer them offer to match the prices of products sold on competitors' online stores just to ensure that you will spend your money with them. Each retailer has its set of rules when it comes to price-matching. Some will only match prices from a certain retailer; some limit the number of price-matched items you can purchase. Some choose not to price-match internet only retailers such as Amazon, while others have no such policy. Very few will price-match a product if the item is not stocked and ready to be sold on the competitor's website. To price match an item, you be required to print the online listing of the product in question. Alternately, you can show the listing to the sales associate by pulling it up on your mobile phone. However, since rules vary so much, be sure to learn each company's rules before approaching them for a price match.The most important part of getting a great deal is feeling as though you got one. However, getting a great deal is not as complicated as it seems. There are lots of tools available for you to use. All it takes is a little persistence and an unwillingness to say no."

Waking up to reports of a mass shooting. This time in Orlando. First twenty dead. Now fifty. We carefully allow those numbers to enter our brain. We compare them to Sandy Hook and San Bernadino. Neither of those were that high, right? We know that soon their faces will stare back at us from our laptops and televisions. Soon we'll compare their smiles and stories to our loved ones. But for now, we're allowed to box them into a simple, tragic double digit. We watch the news report the same facts over and over again. The shooter's name is reported repeatedly because it's one of the few things they know. They try to keep us entertained until new information emerges. As if new facts will make any of this make sense. But they keep reporting and we keep waiting. We read the horrifying headlines of stories posted by our Facebook friends. ""Deadliest Shooting in US History"" pops up again and again. Which we haven't seen since Sandy Hook. Or was it Virginia Tech? They're accompanied by vague statuses about ""thoughts and prayers,"" ""broken hearts,"" ""when will this stop?"" Although the sentiment is genuine, we've seen it and said it all before. We scroll through Twitter. It's not even noon and the shooting is already politicized. Perhaps it should be. Regardless of which side of the gun debate we're on, there are tweets we identify with and tweets that enrage us. The terms assault weapon and terrorism get tossed around once again. We see politicians tip toeing around the issues. And others diving right in. There's so much passion surrounding this, we wonder if something might change this time. Just like we did last time. We think how something needs to change. Whether it's improved mental health services or perhaps effective gun laws. We know our country is the world leader in mass shootings. We know other countries have much stricter gun laws and much fewer deaths. We know something's broken in our country. We want to see change.And then we finish our morning coffee and start our day. It's a beautiful Sunday in June and we have kids and pets and gardens and barbeques. Orlando will surely come up with the people we run into. Everyone will agree how terrible it is. How could someone do such a thing? We'll glance at our phones as the first pictures of the vibrant victims pop up, but then we'll also look at photos of our friends' vacations and cats. We were lucky this time. This time we found out from a tweet and not a police officer's phone call in the middle of the night. This time we could keep our distance - our sadness and disbelief neatly contained into an anecdote at a Game of Thrones viewing party. This time our lives continue untouched while we wait for the next time."

The Lakers would go on to win the championship, and Iverson's step-over was etched into basketball lore as an epic moment of confidence and embarrassment. On Saturday, during Game 4 of the 2016 NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron pulled a move that seemed awfully similar on the Golden State Warriors' Draymond Green in the fourth quarter. The only issue was it came from a place of frustration, not confidence -- the game out of reach for the Cavaliers and the team on the brink of going down 1-3 in the best of seven series. The irony here, if you wish to call it that, is that Lue is currently the Cavaliers' head coach, making him feel a bit on the losing end of this move as well. James, one of the greatest to ever play the game, played well of course. He scored 25 points, pulled down 13 rebounds and dished out 9 assists. But something tell us no one will remember that. His team lost, 108-97. And instead, we'll likely remember his attempt at intimidation in Game 4 as a failed moment. On to Game 5, where the James and the Cavaliers will face elimination."

Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders alleges that in some Orange County cases, the jailhouse informants did just that.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575b46e41500002a00739f77.jpeg?cache=ifZEgUYEGu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES -- After almost three years of denials, the Orange County District Attorney's office finally acknowledged Thursday that the county has a jailhouse informant program. Of course, the existence of the informant program should come as no surprise. Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders has been arguing since 2013 that a tainted snitch network in county jails has existed in secret for decades. In a series of blockbuster motions, the defense attorney unearthed damning evidence that clearly pointed to the program's existence, alleging that county prosecutors and police have violated multiple defendants' rights by illegally obtaining and sometimes withholding evidence gleaned from jail informants.Thursday's formal admission came in court documents filed by the OCDA office detailing 1,157 pages of notes kept by sheriff's deputies about inmates and informants in county jails. The notes, kept secret until recently, were recorded from September 2008 to January 2013. The cache of notes ""reveals that jail special handling deputies recruited and utilized numerous informers,"" Assistant District Attorney Dan Wagner wrote in a motion Thursday. ""The informers were often kept in a particular sector. In exchange for their information, informers were given favors by deputies such as phone calls and visits.""What's more, Wagner says, the log contradicts statements made by several witnesses, including police, and may also contradict some evidence previously presented in the Scott Dekraai case, the largest mass-murder case in county history.Law enforcement authorities deploy informants to help bolster a case — a tactic that’s perfectly legal, even when the snitch receives something in exchange. But Sanders alleges that in some Orange County cases, informants held recorded and unrecorded conversations with inmates who were already represented by lawyers, which violates an inmate’s right to counsel. Prosecutors then took damning evidence gathered by the informants and presented it in court, while withholding evidence that could have been beneficial to the defense — which is a violation of a defendant’s right to due process.The log mentions informant names throughout and frequent informant interaction with ""numerous"" and ""high-profile"" inmates, Wagner writes. In the log, the deputies refer to various activities with inmates and informants as ""plans,"" ""capers"" and ""operations,"" and came up with ""self-styled"" code names for these activities like ""Operation Okie Doke,"" the court documents read. The log also mentions outside law enforcement agencies interacting with the deputies who manage inmates and informants. Detectives who testified during the Dekraai case, according to the notes, also inquired about running ""operations"" within the jail.The log sheds new light on interactions between Sheriff’s Deputy William Grover and Fernando Perez, a Mexican mafia leader who later became a prolific informant for the county and had separate contact with both Dekraai and another man accused of murder, Daniel Wozniak, while in jail. This contact, which county prosecutors previously portrayed as coincidental, appears to be intentional, according to log entries.Just weeks after his arrest, Wozniak was placed in the same housing tank as Perez -- who had been housed there just one day earlier. Then, just days before police interviewed Perez about conversations he'd had with Wozniak, a log entry from Grover indicates that he wanted the relationship between Wozniak and Perez to “marinate.""Grover had previously testified during the Dekraai hearings that ""less than zero"" of his time at work was spent dealing with informants. He said he couldn't remember any specific contact with Perez; further, he claimed he didn't know of any contact between Perez and Wozniak and had not given Perez any assignments to get particular information from other inmates.The OCDA's office, which has been under fire for its involvement in mishandling evidence produced from the informant program, has said it had no prior knowledge of the log. In February, portions of the log began to surface when a sheriff’s deputy turned over to a judge four years of personal notes related to a different murder case in the county. Sheriff command staff has similarly said they had no knowledge of the log until Sanders issued the subpoena in search of further information in the Wozniak case and inquiries of staff led to its disclosure. “As your sheriff, I take this issue seriously,” Sheriff Sandra Hutchens, who was appointed in 2008, said in a statement Thursday. “It is important for the public to know that we have been responsive to all subpoenas, discovery requests and legal mandates based on our knowledge at the time.”Hutchens, who has already implemented new protocols surrounding the handling of jail informants, added that all jail staff were being retrained on “proper record-keeping procedures.”This is the second time Sanders has uncovered a trove of notes that sheriffs kept about inmates and withheld in violation of defendants’ rights. Last year, after Dekraai pleaded guilty to shooting and killing his ex-wife and seven other people in a hair salon in 2011, Sanders discovered a database that the sheriff’s department maintained on informants and inmates that may have been illegally concealed for decades.Sanders’ discoveries caused multiple murder cases in the county to unravel, even resulting in some accused murderers having their sentences vacated. Last year, the misconduct in the Dekraai proceedings led to Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals ejecting the entire DA office from the mass murder trial. He then turned the case over to California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who is still investigating the allegations of misconduct.Earlier this year, a group of former prosecutors and legal experts called on the U.S. Department of Justice to conduct a full investigation of the DA’s office and the sheriff’s department over the informant program.Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has maintained that no one in his office intentionally behaved inappropriately in relation to the jailhouse informant program. He, too, has invited the DOJ to investigate his office’s practices in that area.It remains unclear exactly how many cases may have been affected by tainted informant evidence, but Sanders has argued that every case involving a jailhouse informant in Orange County over the last 30 years deserves to be re-examined.OCDA is now reviewing the log further to determine if any other cases are affected by its contents and need to be turned over as evidence. They've also handed the log over to the state attorney general to be reviewed as part of her ongoing investigation.""After contesting the very existence of a jailhouse informant program in Orange County for years, today the District Attorney's Office was left with absolutely no choice but to face up to critical facts it had formerly disputed and indeed derided,"" Laura Fernandez, a senior Liman Fellow at Yale Law School who studies prosecutorial misconduct around the nation, told The Huffington Post. ""Still more striking, however, is the OCDA's galling suggestion that it be trusted to sort things out moving forward."""
