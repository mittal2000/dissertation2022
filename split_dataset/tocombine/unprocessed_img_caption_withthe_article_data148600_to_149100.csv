From dusky, smoked makeup to textured hair to ankle-length Frye boots below temporary feather calf tattoos to the jangle of M.I.A.'s ""Bad Girls,"" Hoffman's Folk-Mad Max-goes-to-the-beach take on swim was as well-executed at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Swim as her suits and day-to-night coverups and caftans. Hoffman's signature prints were in full effect here, their anthropological beauty set off by texture. Beaded necklines, braiding, latticework, basket weave, fringe, and straps were employed; modal gave a stunning dashiki-print dress very modern movement. The snake print was a stunner, but shapes, however, were the thing: high-waisted bikini bottoms hit the runway along with ever-present maillots, one of which came out in a rousing peacock print. What did we love? Literally, all of it. Check out the collection below and tell us which look is your favorite: "

3,TRAVEL,July's #1 Reason to Whoop It up in Wyoming,"Laura Manske, Contributor
Travel Trendspotter, Culture Vulture, Idea Genie",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/julys-1-reason-to-whoop-i_us_5b9d58b9e4b03a1dcc86eb38,You don't have to know the difference between a hooey and a honda (rope knotting/looping terms) to appreciate cowboys' and cowgirls' athletic prowess. The  Cheyenne Frontier Days -- the world's largest outdoor rodeo competition -- runs July 19th to 28th.,2013-07-19,2013-07-14-LauraManske.7.2012WyomingCheyenneFrontierDaysChildren7ac.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-07-14-LauraManske.7.2012WyomingCheyenneFrontierDaysChildren7ac.jpg," As a happily stiletto-wearing New York City gal, I also love to kick up my Western boot heels attending rodeos all over America. And the rowdy revelry that has grabbed my heart more than any other show is Cheyenne Frontier Days -- the world's largest outdoor rodeo competition, affectionately called the Daddy of 'em All. In its 117th year, this Best of the West, family-friendly celebration runs July 19th to 28th and showcases almost 1,500 bull-riding, steer-wrestling, horse-galloping, barrel-rolling, lasso-twirling contestants, who vie for $1-million in money and prizes. You don't have to know the difference between a hooey and a honda (rope knotting/looping terms) to appreciate cowboys' and cowgirls' athletic prowess. Sure, the romping-and-stomping hoopla in Frontier Park's grandstand arena is the rodeo centerpiece that draws visitors to Cheyenne from as far away as Australia and Argentina, but what I adore most is watching the many circles of smiles -- on faces young and old -- that carry forward across various CFD venues, like ripples created by stones skipped across a lake. CFD, sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), is as sweet and old-fashioned as it is up-to-date and professionally managed. ""Travelers who've never experienced CFD would be amazed to discover our size, scope, and nonstop action in the arena and track,"" says Darin Westby, general chairman of CFD. What gets the most high-fives? ""The thousands of area volunteers, who give graciously and generously of their time and energy to make this annual event a success,"" he explains. Indeed, beyond a small, paid, logistics staff, CFD is made possible only by the coming together of approximately 2,300 can-do Wyomingites, who freely flip flapjacks at breakfasts, scoop chili at cook-offs, toot horns at train buff meet-ups, tend livestock, landscape grounds, direct traffic, hand out flyers, build fences, paint signs, haul trash, collect tickets, and plenty more. In the arena, matches last all afternoon, so wrangle a schedule first thing in order to focus on the championships that light your fire. Stretch your legs at other times, because there is so much do-si-do to do here. These are my other favorite finds in the Frontier Park and Fairgrounds. • Kick-off your CFD fun with a behind-the-chutes tour, which will lead you to the animal pens and inner-gates. You'll better understand how rodeos work and events are judged. • Explore Old West Museum, brimming with historical artifacts, an impressive collection of pioneer wagons and carriages, and inspirational artwork. • Talk to cowgirls and cowboys, who often are open to tell you about their life. I always learn something new from them, especially humorous philosophical tidbits, such as ""Don't squat with your spurs on,"" ""If you think you're a person of influence, try ordering somebody else's dog around,"" ""Success is getting back on the horse one more time than you fall off,"" and ""If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging."" Last year, I asked a Cheyenne rancher for his top advice. He told me never to touch a cowboy's hat. I didn't have a chance to follow-up with a ""Why not?"" But it seems like a smart recommendation.• Shop Wild Horse Gulch -- a row of quaint-looking stores in Old Frontier Town -- for silver-turquoise jewelry, leather-fringed fashion, and country-themed housewares. • Relish the Native American music, dance, crafts, and storytelling in the Indian Village with members of Northern Arapaho and Shoshone tribes. • Meet beautiful rodeo queens sporting glittery tiara-embroidery on their cowgirl hats. • Chow down on tangy barbecue and spiral spuds. • Take a whirl on Carnival Midway's Ferris wheel and merry-go-round.• Slide into a pair of Western boots, sold in huge tents. Be dazzled by the hundreds of styles, designs, and colors.• Dance at straw-on-the-floor Buckin'A Saloon, where Chancey Williams & the Younger Brothers Band strum memorable music moves. • Savor the sparkle of stars under an ink-black sky at outdoor concerts headlined by Toby Keith, Jason Aldean, Alan Jackson, Dwight Yoakam, Luke Bryan, Rascal Flatts, Journey, and Styx.  Approximately 3 percent of CFD's revenue is donated to Cheyenne community organizations as well as regional groups (some as far away as Montana and Colorado). In addition, a $64,000 annual college fund awards scholarships to young volunteers, plus nearly $55,000 goes to the aid of volunteers facing a financial or health crisis. ""It's important to help our neighbors whenever we can,"" adds Westby."
4,FOOD & DRINK,A Green Gazpacho: Chilled Cucumber Soup With Yogurt and Fresh Mint,"Viviane Bauquet Farre, Contributor

And if you don't have a bit of garden to watch these miraculous vines grow, you'll at least notice the stall of every vegetable grower at your farmers' market overflowing with many varieties of cucumbers.Most gardeners and cooks want to know: what to do with all these cukes?! Once you've made your favorite salad or special relish a dozen times over, there's still a way to enjoy this humble vegetable: a chilled soup!What I love most about cucumbers is their crunchiness and their delicate, fresh flavor. That's exactly what I tried to highlight when creating this recipe. Served very chilled, the soup is not only light, but extraordinarily refreshing -- a perfect hors d'oeuvre or first course for a summer menu.For a bit of fun, I like to serve this soup in stemless martini glasses (it's easy to sip and won't fill anyone up before dinner). For a gorgeous presentation, I garnished the glasses with yellow tomato cubes and a drizzle of lemon-infused oil.And just like that, the humble cucumber is transformed into a green gazpacho every bit as exciting and delicious as its big sister!Chilled Cucumber Soup with Yogurt and Fresh Mintserves 4 as an appetizer or 12 as an hors d'oeuvre active time: 20 minFor the soup 1 3/4 lbs (795 g) seedless cucumbers - peeled and cut in 3"" pieces (or 2 lbs (905 g) regular cucumber peeled, seeded and cut in 3″ pieces) 1/4 medium red onion - skinned 1 garlic clove - skinned 1 jalapeño - stem removed, halved and seeded 8 large mint leaves 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon maple syrup 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 - 6 oz (170 g) non-fat plain yogurt 1/2 to 3/4 cup spring water to tasteFor the garnishes lemon oil 1 medium yellow tomato - seeded and cut in 1/8"" cubes (or 8 yellow grape tomatoes quartered) tiny mint leavesStep 1: Place all ingredients in the bowl of a food processor with 1/2 cup of the spring water.

If necessary, thin with the remaining water to the desired consistency.Step 2: Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight, until well chilled. Place the soup in the freezer for 30 minutes before serving.Step 3: Ladle soup into chilled soup bowls or cocktail glasses. Drizzle a little lemon oil in the center of each bowl. Garnish with a few tomato cubes, a mint leaf and serve immediately.Cook's note: The soup can be refrigerated for up to 2 days."

In an interview with BuzzFeed's Amy Odell, Boardman dished about celebrities who were surprisingly easy to shoot for Paper's covers (Lindsay Lohan, Mariah Carey and Prince) and those who were not. The worst ones? Marisa Tomei, Nicki Minaj and Ben Stiller. Although he doesn't go into why Tomei was ""not fun,"" Boardman had a lot to say about the ""two weeks of hideous torture"" with Minaj. ""The first day of the shoot, she was locked in a room with her hair and makeup team, people whom she picked -- she made them put [all her hair/makeup] on, then take it off,"" he said. ""She would not let anyone from our team, stylists or photographers, talk to her. She came out and it was a mess. The photographer took some shots and she said, 'Let me see.' He [showed her] five frames and she walked off -- it was insanity."" As for Stiller, Boardman said he was ""also pretty horrible."" Not only did the ""Zoolander"" star's camp cancel and then reschedule at the last minute, but the actor was none too pleased with the second shooting location. ""At one point he said to his publicist, 'Can you call Mickey and say the air conditioning’s not cold enough?' And I’m like, 'I heard him because he was standing right next to me,'"" he said.Boardman has been at Paper for more than 20 years, after starting there as an intern in 1992. Despite the occasional diva, he loves how rewarding the position is. Plus, he likes getting to mingle with Kim Kardashian, Marc Jacobs and gay porn stars.Minaj has yet to respond to Boardman, but she has been known to fire back at journalists. In May, ""Access Hollywood"" reporter Laura Saltman suggested Minaj was unprofessional when she ignored a question on the red carpet. The rapper then unleashed some Twitter fury Saltman's way.

That is considered lower than in Haiti and Sudan, two places that are not considered the least bit tech friendly,"" wrote Victoria Burnett in a Times piece, ""Salons or Not, Cyberspace Is Still a Distant Place for Most Cubans,"" (NYT, 7/9/13). Everyone has had their Casablanca fantasy. If you are a guy, you're Rick Blaine, the hardened ex-pat. If you're a gal you're Ilsa Lund, the beautiful femme fatale, torn between devotion to the cause and passion for the man she loves. If you're transgender you're a mixture of the two. The problem is that the fantasy is always broken up by an e-mail coming through on your iphone, even if you're in Casablanca itself. It's you're dentist reminding you about your upcoming prophylactic treatment, your wife wondering where you are and why you haven't returned to the hotel or actually your internet provider asking you to complete a brief survey about a new app. What better place to have your Casablanca moment than in Havana where there are not likely to be a lot of WiFi hot spots or even decent cell phone reception to put you back in texting purgatory! And they'll be no problem finding anyone of a number of broken down, but moody cafes that fit the bill. Even though it's become a bit of a tourist spot, there's La Bodeguita del Medio where Hemingway hung out, for starters. One of the problems of modern life is that you can't escape it. Everywhere is exactly the same. No matter the destination, you'll inevitably suffer from Bill Murray's predicament in Groundhog Day. If you think you're suffering from déjà vu, you're definitely right since you've already seen whatever it is you're looking at: Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, KFC, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter. They're everywhere. Remember back forty years ago when you went to Europe and really felt like you were going somewhere, when it was difficult and expensive to call home and when you trekked to American Express to get your mail. If you're looking for that far away feeling, the sense that you have really gone somewhere rather than traveling the moebius strip of modern life, Cuba still fits the bill and it's probably a helluva a lot safer than Haiti or the Sudan.{This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog or rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"
