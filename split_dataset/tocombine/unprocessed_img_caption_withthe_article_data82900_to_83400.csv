Her 38-year-old daughter commented that she could have been in Bland's shoes and that if she ever died in police custody, her mom shouldn't believe it was suicide. The next day, Wilkins launched a MoveOn petition calling for an ""immediate and independent federal investigation"" into Bland's death. Bland, 28, was pulled over on July 10 in Waller County, Texas, for failure to signal. After allegedly assaulting the officer, she was arrested and taken to jail. Three days later, she was found dead in her cell. Investigators have said Bland’s autopsy findings are consistent with suicide.But many people, including Wilkins and Bland's family, remain suspicious of the Waller County Sheriff's Office and concerned about the pattern of police brutality in America. Despite the autopsy's findings, Wilkins said she believes the officer mishandled Bland's traffic stop and should be held accountable.“As her community, [we] should be able to know what actually happened,” Lois Wilkins, 61, told The Huffington Post. ""What are the facts? I just don’t believe that the local police are actually reflecting that. They’re taking too long."" Since its launch on Monday, her MoveOn petition had amassed more than 300,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon -- and was about 16,000 shy of its stated goal of 325,000.On Change.org, another petition is making many of the same pleas, demanding that Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the U.S. Department of Justice take over the investigation. That petition had gathered more than 200,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon.“There’s no reason why we should be fearful [because] of profiling tactics,” Wilkins said. “It’s important for us to speak up for Sandra Bland, who is not able to speak for herself right now."" Wilkins is pleased with the amount of attention her petition has received, but she said it's only the first step in finding the answers.“We have to have some clarity around what we really mean when we give the police the authority to govern our communities or help keep us safe,"" she said. ""Because I’m not sure that message of them keeping us safe is existing in the black community, generally speaking.""Read more on Sandra Bland at the links below:Also on HuffPost:"

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the Select Committee on Benghazi, who said on Friday that the IG had personally told him he did not request a criminal probe. A Justice Department official said in a statement Friday morning that “the Department has received a referral related to the potential compromise of classified information. It is not a criminal referral.”""Maybe the heat is getting to everybody,"" Clinton said. ""We all have a responsibility to get this right. I have released 55,000 pages of emails, I have said repeatedly that I will answer questions before the House committee."" The Times issued a correction on the story on Friday, saying that the article ""using information from senior government officials, misstated the nature of the referral to the Justice Department regarding Hillary Clinton’s personal email account while she was secretary of state. The referral addressed the potential compromise of classified information in connection with that personal email account. It did not specifically request an investigation into Mrs. Clinton.""During a speech on details of her economic policy in New York on Friday, Clinton said that she was being transparent.""We are all accountable to the American people to get the facts right,"" Clinton continued. "" And I will do my part. But I am also going to stay focused on the issues. Particularly the big issues that really matter to American families."" Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of inspectors general from the State Department who had referred an investigation to the Justice Department. It was one inspector general from the State Department and one from the Intelligence Community."
2,POLITICS,Scott Walker Appeals To Anti-Union Crowd At ALEC Conference,"Bill Raden, Capital & Main",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-walker_us_55b259e5e4b0a13f9d1841b8,Scott Walker couldn’t have asked for more.,2015-07-24,"Sen.

Sign up for email alerts from Capital & Main.Scott Walker couldn’t have asked for more.When the Wisconsin governor took the dais Thursday at the American Legislative Exchange Council’s annual conference in San Diego, his audience was ravenous for any vision that included destroying unions and cracking down on America’s criminal underclass.See more of Capital & Main's ongoing coverage of the ALEC Annual MeetingThe venue was the plenary croissants-and-eggs breakfast, but it would be hard to imagine an audience hungrier for the red meat Governor Walker threw out to it.Every key bill Walker has been associated with, since his get-tough-on-crime heyday as a state assemblyman in the 1990s, has been a plagiarism of an ALEC model bill. Such as laws that eliminated parole (and ballooned state prison populations) or that imposed a voter ID law, gutted public education and teacher protections, and made Wisconsin the 25th right-to-work state.Walker himself isn’t an actual member of the secretive corporate lobbying network (ALEC only admits legislators, not chief executives), but no other political figure today has so faithfully promoted ALEC’s laissez faire policy absolutism as Walker.“We took on the unions,” he crowed. “We passed . . . regulatory reform. We defunded Planned Parenthood and passed pro-life legislation. We passed castle doctrine and concealed carry — so law-abiding citizens can protect themselves and their famil[ies], and their property. And I’m proud to say in our state, as blue as it is, our state now says it’s easy to vote but hard to cheat — you need a photo ID to vote.”The applause was rapturous.Just in case the Walker/ALEC program was beginning to sound a little too familiar to some of the older ALEC legislators in the house, the candidate admitted, “Years ago, a plan like that worked pretty well under a guy named President Ronald Reagan.”He characterized what he called “the Obama-Clinton doctrine” as both leading from behind and heading towards disaster. He also invoked the memory of the Iranian hostage crisis of 35 years ago to remind listeners that Iran is still the same dirty dealer.“We have a president who said that climate change was the greatest threat to future generations,” Walker intoned. “On which the president and I respectfully disagree. The greatest threat to future generations is radical Islamic terrorism and we need to do something about it.”For that, the Governor received a prolonged standing ovation."

Mike Hadreas) performing at the 2014 End of the Road festival at Larmer Tree Gardens in Dorset.</span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b104a01800003d00376af8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been almost a year since Seattle-based singer-songwriter Mike Hadreas, who performs under the stage name Perfume Genius, took perhaps the biggest risk of his career to date.Following two critically-acclaimed albums of down-tempo, piano-centric confessional indie pop -- 2010’s “Learning” and 2012’s “Put Your Back N 2 It” -- Hadreas took a different approach with his latest release, “Too Bright.”While the songs on “Too Bright” still explore deeply personal themes that often relate back to Hadreas’ gay identity, the production has been turned up several notches. With high-profile collaborators like Adrian Utley (Portishead) and John Parish (PJ Harvey) on board, elements like Suicide-esque synths and Goblin-flavored percussion entered the equation, all topped off with a heavy dose of Freddie Mercury flourish.The end result is thrilling, particularly when presented in a live context. Hadreas played Chicago’s Pitchfork Music Festival last weekend was no exception. Hadreas took the stage and shared that someone had told him to remove his lipstick during his walk to the stage, to which he responded, ""No, I could have told him 'no' forever."" Then, he launched into the raw, bruising “My Body.” The song sees the singer channelling Harvey at her grittiest, delivering blunt declarations like “I wear my body like a rotted peach / You can have it if you handle the stink,” while strutting across the stage in a style that screams ""deal with it.” While all that might come as a surprise to fans more familiar with Perfume Genius’ quieter, stripped-down songs from his early work, the progression feels natural to Hadreas, who wrote the newer songs with the intention of pushing him beyond what may have felt more comfortable.It wasn’t immediately easy to translate the new songs onto the stage, Hadreas admitted in an interview backstage.“I tried to sing notes I’m scared to try to reach and I tried to ‘act as if’ a little bit,” Hadreas told The Huffington Post. “The first couple shows were a little shaky as far as not knowing how to move or if sound was going to come out when I screamed, but now I feel like a lot of those things are second nature to me. But I’m not, like, the super 100-percent confident front man. I phase in and out of bravado.”The more aggressive approach is also reflected in the videos released for “Too Bright” singles “Queen” and “Grid,” both of which present stirring and disturbing interpretations of the songs’ content. In “Grid,” Hadreas is surrounded by faceless, pulsating bodies wearing silver bodysuits while he admires himself in a hand mirror and opens his legs wide to the pulsating beat. It’s a video so strange Kate Bush would be proud.He plans to aim higher with more visual projects in the future. “I love the videos I’ve made but it’d be nice to up it a little more and do something longer-form,” Hadreas explained. “One of my favorite movies of the last five or 10 years is called ‘Dogtooth’ by Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos. If I made a movie I would want it to be something like that. Everything’s in there, really disturbing moments, really laugh-out-loud moments and there’s touching moments. I like things that have everything all at once.”It is perhaps that feeling-all-the-feelings, work-in-progress vibe that makes Hadreas’ music both so unusual and so appealing, particularly to those who relate to feeling like an outsider.Though Hadreas freely admits he doesn’t have it all figured out yet, he’s happy to be taking his fans along for the journey. “I keep making the music I do because I feel very purposeful about making things that would be helpful or quell some loneliness in people,” Hadreas said. “I really needed that when I listened to music growing up and even now so I don’t mind that sense of duty.”Hadreas’ own journey began in the suburbs of Seattle, where he first came out as gay to himself around the age of 12, and to family and friends after that. One singer in particular played a big role as he came to terms with his sexual identity.“Liz Phair I think was the first music I listened to that really hit that specific note,” Hadreas said. “I heard her music and she unashamedly singing about blow jobs and sexuality, things I hadn’t even had the confidence to Google yet. … I had never heard that word sung or said let alone by a woman and singing it such a powerful, strong way. That was the closest thing I had to hearing my kind of ‘shame’ being told shamelessly.”He was the only out gay person in his high school and, sick of being tormented, ended up dropping out during his senior year. He eventually wound up in New York City, where he began drinking in excess and doing “a Chinese buffet” of drugs. It wasn’t until after he returned back home to the Seattle area and checked himself into rehab that he wrote his first song, “Learning.”He posted that song and the others that followed to a Myspace page beginning in 2008 and eventually caught the eye of Matador Records, his musical home ever since. Though the life of a musician touring the world is not the most conducive to sobriety -- and the majority of artists who end up in rehab do so after their big break, not before -- Hadreas says he “wouldn’t have it any other way.” “I’m glad I did it backwards because I wouldn’t have made it to my shows or made the second album I think if I was still drinking and doing drugs,"" he said. ""Not everyone is like that, but, for me, personally, nothing came from me -- no music, no going to work on time -- out of doing that.”Hadreas presses on with his music and, after a marathon of concerts and festival appearances, he’s ready to head home to get back to writing new music, spending time with his mom and his dog and -- one would hope -- maintaining his always-entertaining social media presence, including Twitter commentary on marriage equality, Internet trolls and pop culture.In addition to having what he calls a Ben Affleck “obsession,” he’s also, it turns out, something of a dedicated Netflix reviewer:“There was one time I flagged every ‘Brokeback Mountain’ review on Netflix that was negative, I was like ‘not helpful’ and I spent like an hour doing it and I wrote a really serious review about it,” Hadreas said. “It's hard for me not to get really sensitive. I don’t brush things off like that very easily. I think my music kind of gives that [defensiveness] a direction and a point to it, not just directionless anger at something.”"

It's just not right.""",2015-07-24,"<p>Ramarley Graham's 9-year-old brother, Chinnor Campbell, holds a sign at a rally on Thursday, July 23, 2015.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b26ec6150000ef00174332.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- It's been nearly two years since the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it was reviewing the evidence in the death of Ramarley Graham, an unarmed black teen gunned down at his home in the Bronx in 2012 by NYPD Officer Richard Haste.And it's been nearly a year since the DOJ told Graham's family it had launched a formal civil rights investigation into his death. Yet while the DOJ has since wrapped up investigations into the deaths of two other unarmed black teens -- Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown -- Graham's family is still waiting for answers. ""We're here demanding that the Department of Justice move swiftly on this case,"" Graham's mother, Constance Malcolm, told a crowd of supporters Thursday outside the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in lower Manhattan. ""They've been investigating for two years now, but that's not telling me anything. I want to know when I'm going to get justice for my son.""""This is Chinnor Campbell, Ramarley's brother, that was in the house when he was killed,"" she continued, her hands resting on 9-year-old Chinnor's shoulders. ""What are you telling him? That the system doesn't work for him? We don't want that. We want the officers involved in Ramarley's killing to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, not a slap on the wrist.""""My son is in a cemetery right now,"" Malcolm added. ""I can't see my son anymore. So what are you telling us? We want justice and we want it now. Preet Bharara, please stop dragging your feet and move on this case. We want to see justice in this case. Because without justice, it's giving the wrong impression of this country. You can't break into someone's home and kill them and walk away scot-free. It's just not right."" During the rally, a group of 40 youth activists from various organizations, including the Justice Committee, Make The Road New York and UPROSE, read aloud a list of facts about Graham's case: On Feb. 2, 2012, the NYPD says a narcotics unit in the Bronx saw Graham adjust his waistband outside a bodega -- a sign, according to the department, that Graham was carrying a gun. The NYPD says that when officers approached Graham, he took off running toward his mother's house just a few blocks away.Surveillance footage, however, shows Graham calmly walking up to his mother's home on East 229th Street. He unlocks the door and glances briefly behind him before walking inside. Seconds later, two cops sprint up to the house, guns drawn, and start trying to knock down the door.For four to five minutes, the footage shows, the officers were unable to get inside. Eventually officers managed to get into the building through a back door and let more in through the front. Police charged upstairs, and one officer broke down the door to Graham's apartment. The NYPD says that when Haste entered the apartment, he confronted Graham inside the bathroom, where the teen was allegedly trying to flush a bag of marijuana down the toilet. The NYPD claims that Graham reached for his waistband during the confrontation, prompting Haste to shoot him once in the chest.But no gun was found on Graham, in the bathroom or anywhere else in the house. Chinnor, then 6 years old, and Ramarley's grandmother, Patricia Hartley, both witnessed the shooting. Graham was later pronounced dead at the hospital.A grand jury in the Bronx indicted Haste on manslaughter charges, but the indictment was thrown out due to an error made by an assistant district attorney when instructing the grand jurors. After a second grand jury declined to indict Haste, the DOJ announced it would review the case. About a year later, it confirmed to the family that it had launched its civil rights investigation. In January of this year, the city of New York announced it had reached a $3.9 million settlement with Graham's family, resolving a federal lawsuit the family had brought against the NYPD over Graham's death. After the settlement was announced, Malcolm said she would keep fighting for Haste to be prosecuted. “The settlement does not bring my son back,"" she said at the time. Jim Margolin, a spokesman for Bharara, told The Huffington Post Friday morning only that the investigation into Graham's death was ongoing. When asked at the rally Thursday why she thought the DOJ's investigation into Graham's death appeared to be taking longer than its investigations into deaths of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin -- neither of which resulted in federal indictments -- Malcolm remained hopeful. ""I'm just hoping the reason why they're taking so long is that they're gonna come back in and indict this officer and prosecute him,"" she said. ""That's what I'm hoping."" "

That is the message of Oldways, a Boston-based food and nutrition education organization, and, thanks to a unique initiative called the African Heritage and Health Program, it is an idea that could go a long way toward addressing some of the serious health disparities facing black Americans.The volunteer program is an extension of the African Heritage Diet Pyramid, which Oldways created in 2011 with historians and dietitians. The idea is straightforward: to not only teach students how to prepare healthy and flavorful food, but also to help them understand how such food connects to their African heritage.“It gives people the tools they need, the techniques they can apply to different plant-based foods on the pyramid,” Sarah McMackin, the program’s manager at Oldways, told The Huffington Post. “The impetus is to try and really help people put this way of eating into practice today.”The program is 100 percent plant-based -- “because we know that is the part of the plate most people could use the most help with,” McMackin explained -- and classes are offered free of charge thanks to a grant from the Walmart Foundation. The initiative began as a pilot program in 2013, and has since grown to the point where it has been offered at 100 different sites nationwide. An African Heritage and Health Program class begins to take shape when a volunteer instructor signs up through the Oldways website and commits to teaching six weekly meetings, recruiting students and helping them track their progress. The organization provides the curriculum and can help instructors secure appropriate kitchen space. In some cases, Oldways has provided funding to reimburse the cost of groceries, but in others the instructors fundraise -- or consider charging a small student fee -- to cover that expense.Instructors, according to McMackin, have included people from a range of backgrounds including dietitians, chefs and other community members who simply want to get themselves -- as well as their community organization or faith group -- to make better food choices.In the first week of class outlined in the curriculum, students taste Jollof rice, a traditional West African dish, learn how to use herbs and spices to make spicy chickpeas and other dishes, and engage in an education segment about hidden sodium in processed foods. By the sixth week, students learn how to make braised cabbage, blackened okra and a mango and papaya fruit salad, and receive tips on how to make healthier choices when eating out.The results have been encouraging. According to entrance and exit surveys administered by teachers to 519 students in 55 six-week classes during the program’s 2013-2014 year, 63 percent of graduates of the program lost weight over the course of the class, 34 percent of students saw a decrease in blood pressure status (dropping a “stage,"" such as going from hypertension stage 1 to prehypertension) and half of the participants lost inches from their waist.In addition, according to the surveys, graduates report that they are cooking at home far more often and eating more leafy greens, whole grains, beans, fruits and vegetarian meals, in addition to exercising more often.McMackin said she believes the lessons of the classes are resonating because they provide an alternative to the common, incorrect narrative that there is a certain inevitability to health disparities such as diabetes in the black community.“I think when you’re barraged by a lot of the health disparities, which are true, but when that’s all that you’re given, there’s a disempowerment to that,” McMackin told HuffPost. “You need something empowering and powerful and positive to counterbalance that, and I think this is doing what we hoped it would do so that folks can feel inspired to make these changes not just from a nutrition standpoint, but from the standpoint of reconnecting to healthy eating as cultural identity.” The program’s success to date has allowed it to expand into a new citywide offering in Philadelphia. As the Philadelphia Inquirer reported last month, Oldways is partnering with five nonprofit groups to offer the free class on a regularly recurring basis, rather than ad hoc, at venues including kitchen spaces at two of the city’s Free Library locations. If it works, they may bring the model to other cities. Since the most common constructive comment that McMackin receives about the classes is simply that students want more of them, she is optimistic the program will continue to grow.“Everyone going through this program is ready to see change within communities of color,” McMackin said. “This is an empowering tool that comes from a positive, rich cultural history that is really shining a light on that history and having positive, tangible results.”"

Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) introduced a bill that would roll back key provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b156a61500002d00174187.jpeg?ops=crop_0_91_2983_1686%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate Appropriations Committee voted Thursday to pass a $20.6 billion spending bill that would decimate President Barack Obama's signature Wall Street reform law.The committee met to vote out the 2016 financial services appropriations bill. But in an unusual move, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) offered an entire bill as an amendment: the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act, a bill he authored and already passed out of the Senate Banking Committee, which he chairs. His legislation takes direct aim at the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. It would dramatically restrict the government's ability to regulate big banks by easing regulations for dozens of mid-size lenders and beefing up oversight of the Federal Reserve. It also rolls back key consumer protections.Democrats seemed stunned by the move, not just because they oppose GOP efforts to chip away at the law, which came in direct response to the lack of regulations on banks that caused the 2008 recession. They were also amazed by the decision to attach Shelby's entire bill -- all 236 pages of it -- to an annual spending bill that was 184 pages long.""Why are you doing this?"" Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked in exasperation. ""You are the chairman of the authorizing committee… You can bring it to the calendar on the floor. Why did you eat this bill? With an amendment larger than the sum total of the bill?""Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who said she'd never seen someone attach an entire bill to an appropriations bill in her 22 years on the committee, said doing so sets ""a terrible precedent"" for getting appropriations bills passed.""I understand your frustration,"" Feinstein told Shelby, referring to his bill not moving as quickly as he wants it to. ""But I just don't think this is the way it should be handled.""Shelby said he is pushing his bill because the ""one-size-fits-all regulatory framework"" of Dodd-Frank is hurting banks that didn't cause the 2008 financial crisis. It's been five years since Wall Street reforms took effect, he said, and in that time regulators and even people from the Federal Reserve have testified before the banking committee that it's worth revisiting pieces of it.""Are we going to revisit all of them? Maybe not on this. But we'll have two trains running,"" said the Alabama Republican whose bill now has a shot at moving as a standalone measure or as part of appropriations legislation. ""This will show that we're serious about this.""Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) offered an amendment to strip all policy riders from the appropriations bill, including Shelby's proposal. It was defeated 14-16.The bill ultimately passed 16-14 with Shelby's amendment in it. It was a party-line vote. A White House spokeswoman declined comment. She pointed to remarks earlier this week by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on GOP efforts to undermine Dodd-Frank.""This tactic of using riders on must-pass legislation to chip away at crucial financial reforms is unacceptable. And let me be clear: this administration will strongly oppose these efforts,"" Lew said Tuesday at a finance industry event. ""Faced with bills that threaten to turn the clock back to 2008 and leave the American people vulnerable to another crippling crisis, I will recommend the President veto them."""
