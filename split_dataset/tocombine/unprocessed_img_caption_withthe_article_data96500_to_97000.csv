I smile back, knowing just how ignorant these people are. Some pretty advanced countries have questionable medical practices.",2015-02-18,A closer look at the small herb garden growing in the kitchen. Day 225 - #CY365 - Homegrown,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d4b624000050005564b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I tell people I work on medical projects in Tanzania, many of them smile and make a joke about witch doctors. I smile back, knowing just how ignorant these people are. Some pretty advanced countries have questionable medical practices.In China, for example, I asked an Internist which type of medicine would be used to treat patients--western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine. ""The patient decides,"" he replied. We then visited the building on the modern hospital campus that housed the traditional pharmacy. I saw prescriptions filled with twigs, herbs, flowers and bark, then wrapped in cloth for the patient to make a tea. ""Our American doctors would love to come here to see this and to review your data,"" I said. He smiled and said, ""We have 4,000 years of history. We don't need data.""At a large Polyclinic in Samara Russia, I met Dr. Lydia, the CEO for a tour of this modern facility. We ended in the basement where she showed me the ""Stone Room"" which was tiled with stone from somewhere in the Ural Mountains and maintained at 55 degrees Fahrenheit, the same temperature as the site from which these stones were mined. ""People come here to spend hours in this room to cure their asthma. If they stay overnight, they can also be cured of their arthritis."" I knew better than to ask Lydia for any data. Nor did I ask Boris, CEO of another polyclinic to document his statement that vodka was essentially a health drink and the more consumed, the healthier you would be.Lubov, CEO of a Maternity Hospital in a southern Russia spa resort town sent two of our U.S. volunteer physicians to the spa for a treatment for fatigue from overwork. They enjoyed the mineral spring water bath and proceeded to the hot mud bath. They were slathered with hot mud and told that it was taken from a nearby lake which was heated by a hot spring. While they were being rinsed off, the technician noted that the health benefits were greatly increased with a rectal pack of the mud -- for women, he said, a vaginal pack worked wonders. Curious, one of the physicians asked, ""How long do the curative properties of the mud last?"" ""About three months,"" the technician replied. ""So you use and reuse the mud for three months, correct?"" ""Yes,"" the technician replied. ""Then we take the old mud back to the lake to regenerate its healing properties and we collect new mud.""With this new information, my colleagues graciously declined the rectal pack and none of the nurses expressed any interest in the curative properties of the vaginal pack.And let's not get too smug about our own country where we have had fads that included psychic surgery, peach pit cures for cancer, daily enemas for ""cleansing"" not to mention miracle diets -- cabbage soup for two weeks, Neanderthal diet, pre discovery of fire diet, meat-only diet, as well as miracle electric device cures for cancer, tonics that cured everything (but had enough alcohol to make you quit worrying) and ""put your hands on the radio"" cures.As a species, we have a blind spot when it comes to doing things to make us feel better. We will carefully scrutinize a contract to buy a house or negotiate tirelessly to buy a car. But we accept without question these miraculous, but undocumented cures for ""whatever ails you."" Usually this ignorance masquerading as secret knowledge results in no great harm except for being cheated and possibly delaying a visit to a physician who can give you a documented treatment. So, the snake oil continues to be sold to people who believe and who don't need or want facts. Oftentimes the purveyors are just cynically preying on our ignorance.Let's not look down on Tanzanian witch doctors. At least they believe their treatments will work."
1,WOMEN,The Lure of Sugar Daddy Sites,"Dr. Gail Gross, ContributorHuman Behavior, Parenting, and Education Expert, Speaker, Auth...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-lure-of-sugar-daddy-sites_b_6673282.html,Men who seek younger partners may be having problems aging and are trying to re-establish a connection with the culture of a younger generation.,2015-02-18,Woman sitting on chair with man beside looking at man,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb600872500003600397840.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As I am sure you have seen, whether you are in the dating pool or not, there is an online dating site for almost every type of demographic segment possible. One of the more recent growing online dating site trends to make its mark in the industry are ""sugar daddy"" sites, websites where women seeking rich men can be paired with rich, older men seeking younger women. The women who use Sugar Daddy dating sitesWhy do women join these types of dating sites? Well, it's complicated... young women join Sugar Daddy sites for a myriad of reasons, including: 1. They are possibly looking for a father figure;2. They may be fixated in an earlier stage of development and wanting to be cared for rather than taking personal responsibility and caring for themselves;3. They may have a problem with intimacy, and need a relationship that offers space and distance;4. They may have a need for control;5. They may desire financial gain (clothes, college, jewelry, hair and makeup, spending money, etc.) and social mobility;6. Perhaps they want to increase their social status;7. They may want security and mentoring from an older partner;8. They may have a narcissistic need to manipulate for goods and services.Finally, a young woman may be seeking not only a superior partner who can give her financial security and social gain, but also because of her own need for power.The men who use Sugar Daddy dating sitesOn the other hand, men who seek romantic satisfaction from a financially-based dating arrangement are using money to replace intimacy. By controlling the purse strings, men step into a fantasy relationship, not very different from prostitution. And by creating the illusion of love, men caught in the web of ""sugar daddy"" dating maintain control and protect themselves from emotional vulnerability. When a partner enters into a relationship with an agenda, it is no longer authentic. Here, each partner has a primary interest other than commitment and responsibility... all the things necessary for a mutual and healthy relationship. Older men are often emotionally trapped in the archetype of seeking a younger partner to reignite the sexual vitality of youth. Men who seek younger partners may be having problems aging and are trying to re-establish a connection with the culture of a younger generation. Further, fear of death and its total annihilation can entice an older male to reach one more time for that feeling of youthful energy. And finally, there may be the psychological need for power and control that creates the space and distance necessary for the male, who has problems with intimacy.The problem with Sugar Daddy dating sitesThere are two things in life you cannot buy: happiness and love. Therefore, Sugar Daddy dating websites, though gaining in popularity, are fraught with problems, for example: lacking in intimacy and lacking the commitment, obligation and responsibility necessary for real relationships. Moreover, these sites promote disparate agendas. An unhappily married older male may be using this site for an uncomplicated affair. Meanwhile, young women have their own program, which may include being fortune hunters, having a need for impersonal sex or other sexual problems. Relationships that are founded on foundations such as these often prove unsatisfying and dangerous to all parties concerned. Your online profile is a permanent record that you can't eraseIf you are a young woman preparing to place your photo and profile on these sites, remember that you are creating your history -- who you are to be, you are becoming. I would remind you that a mutual manipulation, to satisfy separate and independent needs, negatively challenges the potential of mutuality and true happiness. Young women and older males, though satisfied in the short-term, may find that the age disparity and separate agendas lead to a deflated outcome. By investing in a scheme instead of in a person, partners of significant age differences may not be able to find the commitment to sustain a long and enduring relationship... especially when the partnership is based on a manipulation rather than love."
2,STYLE,Why Applaud the Cindy Crawford Photo?,"Pete Wilgoren, ContributorEmmy winning journalist, blogger, & author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-applaud-the-cindy-crawford-photo_b_6705406.html,"What's annoying to me are the bravos for Cindy Crawford and Marie Claire magazine for this photo, which must have been hidden in some drawer like it was shameful.",2015-02-18,"Cindy Crawford arrives at the Opening Of Famed Photographer Brian Bowen Smith's WILDLIFE on Thursday, Oct. 23, 2014, in West Hollywood, Calif.

I haven't given birth. I certainly haven't carried a child around in my stomach for months. None of us men have been through what a woman endures, but I do have a wife and two daughters. Those daughters are growing up in the world and I try to stress to them all the time that beauty goes further than the camera lens ever could.Which is why I'm so conflicted about the photo of an unretouched Cindy Crawford.It's not that the photo isn't an empowering example that women can look beautiful WITHOUT photo retouching... because you absolutely can and do. Women every day are seen in their most perfect form, just being yourselves -- mothers, wives, friends, companions, career women, stay- at-home mom -- ALL the hats you wear.What's annoying to me are the bravos for Cindy Crawford and Marie Claire magazine for this photo, which must have been hidden in some drawer like it was shameful. It seems the photo ONLY saw the light of day because someone leaked it... meaning other folks from the magazine or the photographer or perhaps even Cindy herself thought it wasn't worthy of being seen. THAT is the part that's shameful. Marie Claire isn't denying the picture. It came out with a statement calling Cindy and the photo ""a body that defies expectations -- it is real, it is honest, and it is gorgeous."" So WHY was it never seen? Why do we hide true beauty? Why do we place so much emphasis on perfection and deny the true perfection right there in front of us. What type of message does that send to my kids... and my wife. Explain THAT to me and then explain why everyone is rallying around the beauty of this photo as opposed to protesting the photo might have ever been shelved to begin with.I know many women who aren't super models. I know many women who look their age and look their life experience and that is just perfect. ""Tiger Stripes,"" I've heard the marks called. FINALLY, Cindy is showing her tiger stripes, but ONLY because someone outed the photo... Now she REALLY has a chance to roar and be a true spokesmodel for women and young girls like mine.Find me on Facebook at dadmissions "

Anthony's racism to flippancy regarding Madonna's use of the N-word.",2015-02-17,"Iggy Azalea arrives at the 2015 Clive Davis Pre-Grammy Gala at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Saturday, Feb. 7, 2015, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (Photo by John Shearer/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb600833c000018010d1ef4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Roxane Gay, who is much wiser (and certainly a better writer) than I am, said the following in Bad Feminist:""I embrace the label of bad feminist because I am human. I am messy. I'm not trying to be an example. I am not trying to be perfect. I am not trying to say I have all the answers. I am not trying to say I'm right. I am just trying -- trying to support what I believe in, trying to do some good in this world, trying to make some noise with my writing while also being myself.""I think of this quote often when being trolled by people (both men and women, both in real life and on the Internet) who latch on to any given aspect of my humanity and poke the various bears of my beliefs with ""Oh you like ____? But you're a feminist. How can you like _____ and be a feminist?"" Things I don't like are also subject to this kind of asinine dissection, and a common example is Iggy Azalea. ""Oh you don't like Iggy Azalea? How can you not like Iggy Azalea and be a feminist? She's a woman in a male-dominated industry! You have to root for that!""Well, no. I don't. And here's why.As I have written in the past, Iggy Azalea's rise to fame in the male-dominated rap industry isn't due to her undeniable talent: it's due to the whiteness and verbal blackface that has made her a novelty, white privilege serving as a jetpack that skyrocketed her to the top, surpassing black women who have toiled in the trenches of hip hop for decades. Yet Iggy Azalea denies this at every turn, despite her inability to perform some of the most fundamental aspects of rap music (freestyling, for example), blaming sexism for her criticism and nothing more.And granted, Iggy has faced sexism. I was one of the first to defend her when Eminem made a reference to raping her in one of his songs. I criticized the hacker group Anonymous when they threatened to leak a sex tape they claimed depicted Iggy if she didn't apologize for her racism. This kind of violence is faced almost exclusively by women, and the way Iggy Azalea handled both of these attacks was admirable in both maturity and seriousness.But being a feminist does not provide a ""get out of racism free"" card, and that is the card Iggy has been playing over and over since her rise to fame, which a lot of folks seem to have a whole deck of, from dismissive reactions to Susan B. Anthony's racism to flippancy regarding Madonna's use of the N-word. (""But she's Madonna! She, like, birthed the feminist movement in music!"") When Mikki Kendall launched #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen on Twitter, this is exactly what she was referring to: the idea that the pain of women of color should take a backseat to so-called ""overall feminism,"" as if the concerns of women of color are not included in the ""all"" of that ""overall.""Certainly this isn't an argument of ""I'm a bad feminist, but Iggy Azalea is a worst feminist!"" Not at all. But I do challenge the belief that because I find flaws with Iggy Azalea, my feminism is further flawed. My praying that Iggy wouldn't win a single Grammy -- thank you, Lord -- doesn't mean I was praying for the downfall of women in hip-hop. My laughing at her two days of Twitter beef with Papa John's pizza doesn't mean I don't think the leaking of her private information is a serious matter. That's the thing about being a thinking, multi-dimensional human being: I can, in fact, consider two topics simultaneously. I can laugh at the absurdity of a famous ""rapper"" using her stage name to order subpar chain pizza (and calling it her favorite! God, that's hilarious) while still agreeing that her private information shouldn't be leaked by a thirsty teenage delivery guy who was careless and idiotic.Feminism does not exist to serve as a magical shield to protect women from criticism. I cringe as I write this, knowing that too many (sexist) men have said something very similar, usually while criticizing a woman on sexist grounds. But that's not what I mean. What I mean is that we can't, under the guise of feminist solidarity, allow abusive or abhorrent behavior to go unchecked and uncriticized. And abusive and abhorrent Iggy has been, from now-deleted tweets with racist jokes and denigration of the bodies of women of color to the disturbingly exploitive and pedophilic music video for her song ""PU$$Y,"" in which Iggy raps about her sexual prowess while sitting between the legs of a black boy who can't be more than seven years old. Yet on these matters Iggy's defenders (mostly men and white feminists) have remained silent, insisting instead that she is a feminist icon and blameless of the appropriation for which she is often charged. Between sexist men and white feminist women, then, a disturbing alliance emerges: it seems abhorrent behavior can be ignored, forgiven, overlooked, when the victims are women of color. It seems the preferred brand of feminism is that which is focused on the comfort and terms of white women.That's not the kind of feminism I'm interested in aligning myself with. Feminists generally scoff at the idea that shaving our legs, wearing pink, or changing our last name is ""bad feminism."" It's an outdated way of viewing the F-word: only the fools who still use ""feminist"" as an insult still believe feminists are hairy, man-hating whores. But just as antiquated is the idea that feminism is for white women, and that the Iggy Azaleas of the world can trample women of color -- appropriating their bodies, their language, and their culture -- and still be flawless feminists worthy of praise and nothing else.In another world, I might have liked Iggy Azalea. I admire how she has criticized publications for Photoshopping her moles. She can also take a joke; dressing up as a character from White Chicks after being memed online following a beef with Snoop Dogg. But as of now, this is not that world. I may be a bad feminist -- messy, human -- but as Roxane says, I'm also ""trying to support what I believe in, trying to do some good in this world."" And if calling out Iggy Azalea makes me a bad feminist (or a worse feminist) then that is just what I'll have to be.Olivia Cole is an author, blogger, and bigmouth.

5,FIFTY,Fifty Shades of Grey Hair: Yuppie Porn and Hippie Fantasies,"Sabine Reichel, ContributorFeminist, Stylist, Writer, Gray Rebel, Soul-Detective",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fifty-shades-of-grey-hair_b_6681210.html,"There is a big difference between seeing sex on screen, reading about it and doing it. The three are worlds apart, and it is a difficult task for filmmakers to shock or titillate with kinky sex when it's become something almost pedestrian and readily available on your iPhone.",2015-02-17,"Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson pose for photographers upon arrival at the UK premiere of the film 'Fifty Shades of Grey' in London, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2015. (Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision for Universal Pictures/AP Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb66fdd2200004301dccdd5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Naturally, most films aren't made for the grey-haired set, in spite of being named things like Fifty Shades of Grey. But fearless boomers that we are, we like to keep up with modern life. And since single seniors have more time and can go to the movies during the day, that is what I did. So, there I was, sitting in a comfy chair ensconced by calming darkness and icy-cold air conditioning (Los Angeles, folks!) in case I got too hot under the collar. So, what happens when an older woman who came of age in the intoxicating days of sexual awakening watches the much-talked about potboiler? My expectations were low. After all, the book has been cattily labeled ""Mommy Porn"" by critics -- meaning it's not so scandalous that the star, Dakota Johnson, couldn't send Mom, Melanie Griffith, to the movies without cringing. But now I know, should cringing ensue, it is probably not because of sex, sado, flogging or fornication. I did a fair amount of eye-rolling, had a few yawns, but mostly laughed. And then unabashed nostalgia hit me with flashbacks, which I think are inevitable when seeing films about sexual adventures.Our heroine, Anastasia Steele, a badly dressed, particularly clueless young woman (think Anne Hathaway in The Devil wears Prada), ends up in a rich man's sick fantasy world (think Pretty Woman), and is transformed into a willing slave of sex, money and love. Sure, if you're a poor college student, why not hang out in a breathtaking billionaire's bachelor pad and have sex in all its possible forms -- and then some? There is that pale young man named Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) with model-looks and a nose so sharp it could cut paper. He offers what he considers dangerous derring-do, but what actually looks a bit like preppy porn because he's so clean cut and impeccably dressed. But he has deep pain in his puppy eyes. ""I don't do romance,"" he warns her in a forbidding manner. He shouldn't have said it, because that is the surefire proclamation that is still catnip for todays' young women. Every Good Girl with a savior complex and a nurturing heart will jump at this opportunity to do some healing. Not exactly a spell-binding premise, I thought, wishing I had brought more chocolate-covered almonds...So, when shy Ana interviews the Grey Fox for a college paper, my mind started wandering back to my very own years as a 19-year-old reporter who covered music and movie stars. I was a capricious young woman in 1968, and I certainly wasn't shy, obsequious or as easily impressed as Anastasia. We were living in exciting times, right in the middle of that sexual revolution. Freedom for all! And I was living it up with gusto, passion and crazy and wonderful sexual encounters that almost seem innocent by comparison with today's mores. Honestly, I had never really heard of sadomasochistic sex, bonding and all those things that involved NOT only pleasure, but physical pain.Not to draw too many similarities to Ana's life, but I do admit that being a pretty reporter can turn into a sexy game of pursuit anytime, anywhere. I myself was chased in several cases by my interview subjects (European actors and musicians, two famous, the others well-known), involving nightly knocks on my hotel room door (I was on assignment), drunken groping, attempts at passionate kisses in an elevator and charming ""attacks"" by the swimming pool.I liked the guys, but I wasn't impressed. They weren't my type, and when you're young and desired, you feel like you can pick and choose and take your time because there will always be a long line of men waiting for you with impatient passion. (That turned out to be a slight miscalculation after 50 plus years on the planet, by the way). Should I mention that nobody had their own helicopter or an obsession with neckties and slick designer clothes? Young men weren't penthouse-pimps like the Grey dude, they didn't brag about fat bank accounts and corporate jobs to impress girls. It was the sixties, men were more likely to get a hot chick into bed by being a slightly androgynous charming guy with long curls and bell-bottoms -- preferably with a guitar. In the newly-minted PC circles with its slightly radical leanings towards feminism and anti-capitalism, Don Juans and vain billionaire tycoons were never heard of and if so, they were definitely sneered at. The more hip girls of the '60s would have never ever seen such a benign and bourgeois retro movie like Fifty Shades, which is basically he old struggle of Good Girl trying to be Bad Girl but ending up Good Girl who will always leave everything behind and would die gladly so a man can live. As far as I remember, 45 years ago, a great number of young women weren't interested in being pliant princesses. The nice thing about sex in the sixties was that no money or status symbols whatsoever were involved. What goes on in Fifty Shades of Grey is capitalist sex, kinda corrupt, kinda three-piece-suited. Kinda boring. In short: Undecorated, cheap sex is a winner. I don't know how much pain, serious trussing and whipping and begging was going on back in my youth, but oh, the good old playful ""bondage"" days. I remember them fondly. Done with a classic red bandana (which worked as a blindfold as well) and lots of cracking up and kidding around. Maybe it was the pot we smoked, maybe just the silliness of carefree youth. Sex was seen as pure hedonistic fun and enjoyment. Let's not forget that sex is still not just fun; it's funny too. And I mean funny as in laughing. I don't know about you, but I always felt that laughing in bed is one of the most liberating and refreshing things that lighten up the solemn and dark elements that come with sexuality. That much-needed laughter is lacking in the movie, too. Which is surprising, because who could keep a straight face when someone is brandishing a riding crop or wants to tie you up like a pot roast! (See Madonna's face on her new album cover -- funny!) Unfortunately, Mr. Grey is an earnest customer, unsexy and unsizzling. After all, these S & M shenanigans are not about joy, but power. He is the dom, and that is because he is rich and he is a man. So, it's money that talks, and it's not so much corporal, but corporate sex that might cause yawns in the moviegoer instead of erotic fantasies. There is a big difference between seeing sex on screen, reading about it and doing it. The three are worlds apart, and it is a difficult task for filmmakers to shock or titillate with kinky sex when it's become something almost pedestrian and readily available on your iPhone. So, this is indeed a good film for boomers if they want to be reminded of simple sex without an agenda, when fresh ideas, unruly passionate lust, tussled hair, a tear in the t-shirt, rolling around on the floor and dripping with real sweat were enough excitement. Maybe it makes a big difference whether it's Beyoncé or Jimi Hendrix playing while someone is putting handcuffs on you...After the movie I went home, cool as a cucumber. But I did think of an old boyfriend I was madly in love with when I was 23. He was the one with the bandana idea... What was he doing these days?Maybe next time, when in the mood for pensioner-porn, I will try drinking ""Fifty Cups of Earl Grey"" instead. That'll make my pulse race!"

A rule that was so despised has spawned a new financial opportunity for the players.",2015-02-17,"NEW YORK, NY - FEBRUARY 15: Carmelo Anthony of the Western Conference All-Stars talks to the media during the 2015 NBA All-Star Game as part of the 2015 All-Star Weekend at Madison Square Garden on February 15, 2015 in New York, New York.

""I'm like Kanye, Pharrell,"" says the boyfriend of Iggy Azalea. ""You could compare me to those levels.""Young is not referring to his stardom on the basketball court, but as his role as an ""N.B.A. fashion guy."" The article, entitled ""Posing for Fashion Houses, N.B.A. Stars Feel at Home,"" is written by Andrew Keh and discusses ""the growing synergy between the N.B.A. and the world of fashion -- how and why the league has become such a fertile source of brand pitchmen and style icons.""It's worth noting that the Association's All-Star festivities took place here in the Big Apple, where both the city's teams are below .500, and two franchise owners have been removed in the past 12 months for racist controversies. Yet the lead article in the Times Sports section is about fashion, and none of the previously mentioned topics makes an appearance.Perhaps the most notable absence, however, is any mention of David Stern's unilaterally-imposed dress code.It's October, 2005, and NBA stars are in a public war of words with the NBA Commissioner. The dust still hasn't settled from the infamous Malice at the Palace, where a game had to be cut short when Ron Artest and his Indiana Pacers teammates went into the stands and fought a group of fans.The NBA has imposed a series of public relations alterations as a result of the incident. Amongst them is the requirement of players to sign autographs following pregame warm-ups and the creation of the NBA Cares Initiative. The most public alteration, however, is Stern's dress code, making the NBA the first major sports league to require its athletes to dress a certain way.The dress code requires all NBA players to wear ""business casual attire"" before games, after games, and during any official league event. Business Casual is described as the following:• A long or short-sleeved dress shirt (collared or turtleneck), and/or a sweater. • Dress slacks, khaki pants, or dress jeans.  • Appropriate shoes and socks, including dress shoes, dress boots, or other presentable shoes, but not including sneakers, sandals, flip-flops, or work boots. The dress code, predictably, has struck a nerve with a number of the Association's African-American stars, who view the rules as an attack against who they are and who they represent.""When I saw the part about chains, hip-hop and throwback jerseys, I think that's part of our culture,"" said 28-year-old Boston Celtics star Paul Pierce. ""The NBA is young black males."" ""They're targeting my generation -- the hip-hop generation,"" said Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson, who would lead the league in points-per-game that season. Golden States Warriors guard Jason Richardson went so far as to call the changes race-motivated: ""They want to sway away from the hip-hop generation. ... One thing to me that was kind of racist was you can't wear chains outside your clothing. I don't understand what that has to do with being business approachable. ... Some of them have religious meanings behind their chains, others have personal messages behind their chains. Some guys just like to wear them. I think that was an indirectly racial."" Even then NBA players union president Antonio Davis got involved, telling USA today ""I don't think it's fair for them to tell you exactly how to dress."" Back to present day and the NY Times piece. The Houston Rockets' James Harden, a blooming NBA star since escaping the shadow of the Oklahoma City Thunder's Big Two, openly discusses his foray into fashion.""It's different for me,"" said Harden. ""I'm starting to move in this direction. This is a big step for me.""Harden sounds not like a man embracing the world of menswear -- not like Young, and certainly not like his former teammate Russell Westbrook, who features prominently in the article -- but as a marketing icon trying to score a big buck. Wrote Keh; ""Harden... acknowledged that he was still trying to establish this sort of comfort level."" This is not Harden's cup of tea, as it were, but a necessity in today's modern NBA to adequately expand his brand.Earlier this year, Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade spoke openly about how the dress code changed the mindset of NBA stars.""It was like, 'OK, now we got to really dress up and we can't just throw on a sweat suit,'"" Wade said. ""Then it became a competition amongst guys and now you really got into it more and you started to really understand the clothes you put on your body, the materials you're starting to wear, so then you become even more of a fan of it.""The ""hip-hop generation,"" as Iverson described it, is dead, at least in the NBA. Chains and do-rags has been replaced by turtlenecks and eyewear. While Stern's decree was intended to protect his own brand in a manner that would make Roger Goodell blush, the dress code has proven to be mutually beneficial. A rule that was so despised has spawned a new financial opportunity for the players.The NBA fashion movement has become so profitable, in fact, that its initial protests are all but forgotten. Wrote Keh:""For years in the N.B.A., players have viewed being well dressed as a given, as much a part of modern basketball culture as lay-up lines and pregame stretches.""Considering it was just 10 years ago that the NBA's biggest stars, names such as Pierce, Iverson and even Tim Duncan (who called it ""basically retarded""), were fighting for the right to wear whatever they wanted, it's curious Keh would make such a proclamation.But thats just the point; the code was embraced by a new generation of NBA stars with such fervor that it is hard to imagine an NBA All Star Weekend that doesn't coincide with NYC's fashion week. Events at Macy's and Bloomingdale's seem as much a part of basketball as, to quote Keh, ""layup lines and pregame stretches.""''Every player should have a feel of how they market their own selves,"" said Pierce in 2005. ""We should be able to dress the way we feel.""In today's modern NBA, the stars are doing just that. It's difficult to imagine properly discussing this point of arrival without respectfully appreciating its initial point of departure."
7,COMEDY,'SNL' Alum Brooks Wheelan Talks Stand-Up And Leaving New York,Katla McGlynn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brooks-wheelan-too-long-didnt-listen-podcast_n_6689558.html,,2015-02-17,"LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS -- Episode 0159 -- Pictured: (l-r) Comedian Brooks Wheelan during an interview with host Seth Meyers on February 5, 2015 -- (Photo by: Lloyd Bishop/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad50562400005100961633.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After his stint as a writer and featured player on ""Saturday Night Live"" ended, comedian Brooks Wheelan doubled down on stand-up comedy, released his first album, ""This Is Cool, Right?"", and then got the hell out of New York.Uprooting from Los Angeles, Wheelan says he arrived in NYC a ""Happy go lucky"" comedian, but he is leaving having felt like he's been through bootcamp. As you'll learn throughout this 12th episode of our podcast, New York, with its streets full of garbage and total lack of campsites or Wal-Marts, is like an incubator for stand-up comics who want to find their voice. Wheelan has put together a debut album that's funny and real, from stories about growing up that will speak to any youngest sibling, to more personal stories involving ecstasy at Bonnaroo and what it's like to get fired from ""SNL."" As for whether or not Wheelan is actually looking to be a ""cool"" comic, as his album title suggests, it's more like the opposite is true.""You never want to be the cool guy on stage,"" he says. ""I don't like cool comedy. I don't like 'tough guy' comedy where people are like, 'Listen to this fuckin' idiot I ran in to!' I'm like okay, 'I like to be the fuckin' idiot in the story.'""You can pick up Wheelan's album now on iTunes and Amazon, with a vinyl release coming in April."
