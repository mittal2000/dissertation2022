0,POLITICS,Tens Of Thousands Of Californians Are About To Get Their Voting Rights Restored,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-v-bowen-appeal-california_us_55c10470e4b0e716be074bc6,A settlement restoring voting rights to ex-offenders comes just two days before the anniversary of the Voting Rights Act.,2015-08-04,Because Most Americans Are Unenthusiastic About It,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559de2b71700002600325e03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Tens of thousands of California residents will soon have their voting rights restored as the state drops its appeal of a ruling that found the state could not bar individuals who have left prison and completed parole and are now under county supervision from registering to vote.California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, who was elected last fall, announced Tuesday that the state would no longer attempt to overturn the ruling in Scott v. Bowen, a reversal of the stance taken by his predecessor, Debra Bowen.In 2011, California began shifting thousands of low-level offenders out of state prisons and into county custody as part of Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown's realignment initiative. During that transition, Bowen issued a directive saying a state law that barred individuals in prison or on parole for felony convictions from voting also applied to ex-offenders under county supervision.The American Civil Liberties Union and several other organizations later filed suit in Scott v. Bowen, arguing that the secretary of state's directive unconstitutionally disenfranchised over 60,000 Californians. An Alameda County Superior Court Judge sided with the ACLU in 2014, and California appealed the ruling.The settlement announced Tuesday comes two days before the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. According to the ACLU, ex-offenders will regain the right to register to vote as soon as the state's First District Court of Appeals officially grants Padilla's motion to withdraw the appeal.During a press conference, Padilla said Bowen's appeal of the decision was the one policy he could not support when he took office in January.""If we are serious about slowing the revolving door at our jails and prisons, and serious about reducing recidivism, we need to engage -- not shun -- former offenders,"" he said. ""Voting is a key part of that engagement; it is part of a process of becoming vested and having a stake in the community.""""The United States Supreme Court eloquently proclaimed, 'No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined,'"" Padilla continued. ""Today’s announcement is in line with these pronouncements, the arc of California history and the spirit of the Voting Rights Act.""Sharron Cherisse of San Diego is one of the individuals whose voting rights will be restored. She was unable to vote in the 2012 presidential election because she was on probation.""I wanted to be a part of that, a part of history,"" Cherisse, 37, told The Huffington Post. ""And I wasn't able to, and that really bothers me.""She now plans to register to vote as soon as the appeal is officially withdrawn.""I'm excited to be able to vote in 2016,"" she said.""Padilla is bucking a national trend in which voting rights are under attack,"" Lori Shellenberger, director of the ACLU of California’s Voting Rights Project, said in a statement. ""We are thrilled that this administration has effectively said 'no' to Jim Crow in California, and instead is fighting for the voting rights of California’s most vulnerable communities.""Also on HuffPost:"

Chris Christie revealed during a New Hampshire campaign stop Tuesday that he has used birth control. “I’m a Catholic, but I’ve used birth control and not just the rhythm method,” Christie told diners while at Blake’s Restaurant in Manchester.Christie acknowledged that using certain forms of contraception is a violation of the Catholic Church’s teachings, but said he does not regret it.“So you know, my church has a teaching against birth control,” Christie said. “Does that make me an awful Catholic because I believed and practiced that function during part of my life? I don’t think so. But you know what? I’m only going to find out when it is my time to be judged.”Campaign spokesperson Samantha Smith, when asked what forms of birth control Christie has used, told The Huffington Post, ""I can't answer that last part.""Christie, who was re-elected governor of New Jersey by a landslide in 2013, has struggled to gain traction in the Republican primary to this point. According to HuffPost Pollster’s aggregation of major polls, Christie enjoys the support of 3.6 percent of Republican primary voters, putting him just behind Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and ahead of Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R).Christie’s frank remarks are consistent with his image as a more moderate Northeastern Republican who tends to emphasize fiscal conservatism and his willingness to take on labor unions, rather than social issues. He has chosen to focus his campaigning in New Hampshire, where the primary electorate is less socially conservative than in other early primary states like Iowa or South Carolina.But Christie’s comments will only reinforce the perception among the Republican Party’s socially conservative wing that Christie is too moderate to be the party’s nominee. Although Christie currently opposes abortion rights, he admitted to donating to Planned Parenthood while running for county freeholder in the 1990s.He also chose not to challenge a New Jersey Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage in October 2013. Sam Stein contributed reporting for this story.CORRECTION: This article previously suggested that Christie admitted to donating to Planned Parenthood while a state Senate candidate in the 1990s; he was running for county freeholder.Also on HuffPost:"

5,POLITICS,Anti-Pot Hard-Liner Chris Christie Says Drug War Is A 'Failure',Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-drug-war_us_55c11519e4b0a50ad0aac0ec,...even though he's more or less vowed to restart it.,2015-08-04,Because Most Americans Are Unenthusiastic About It,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559de2b71700002600325e03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale," New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said on Monday that the war on drugs has been a ""failure"" -- even though he has vowed to enact a federal crackdown on marijuana, a substance that has been a primary target of the drug war for decades.""This is a disease and the war on drugs has been a failure -- well-intentioned, but a failure,"" Christie said at a presidential forum in New Hampshire on Monday. He went on to say that the country should ""embrace"" people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol, offering them a chance at rehabilitation rather than incarceration.Christie's remark about the war on drugs reflects the views of many lawmakers and drug policy reformers alike. But critics of the two-term governor and 2016 presidential hopeful say that his record of forceful anti-marijuana rhetoric suggests he may be missing the point.""Governor Christie is right that the war on drugs is a failure,"" Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, told The Huffington Post. ""But what he apparently doesn’t realize is there are more arrests and prosecutions for marijuana than for any other drug. The war on drugs begins and ends with marijuana."" Marijuana offenses account for roughly half of all drug-related offenses, and most of those are for simple possession. According to a recent report on marijuana arrests from the American Civil Liberties Union, of the more than 8 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88 percent were for just being in possession of the drug. The report also found significant racial disparities in the arrest patterns. While both black and white Americans use marijuana at about the same rates, blacks were nearly four times more likely than whites, on average, to be arrested for marijuana during the years examined.In 2011, according to the FBI's uniform crime report, there were more arrests in the U.S. for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.While the U.S. accounts for just 5 percent of the world’s population, it's home to a full 25 percent of the world’s prisoners. The harsh sentences for nonviolent drug possession and distribution crimes are part of the reason that figure is so high. In 1980, there were roughly 40,000 drug offenders in U.S. prisons, according to research from the Sentencing Project, a prison sentencing reform group. By 2011, the number of drug offenders serving prison sentences had ballooned to more than 500,000 -- most of whom were not high-level operators and did not have prior criminal records.It's hard to calculate the human toll of all those incarcerations, some of them years or decades long. But by some national estimates, it costs state and local governments between $10 billion and $20 billion a year just to maintain the prohibition on marijuana.Christie, who is one of more than a dozen Republicans vying for the party's presidential nomination, has made no secret of his opposition to cannabis. Although he said this week that he has ""no problem"" with medical marijuana when prescribed by a doctor, he has opposed even his own state's limited medical marijuana program and has called similar laws in 22 other states a ""front"" for full recreational legalization. He has characterized taxes generated from the sale of marijuana as ""blood money."" He threatened to veto a decriminalization measure in his home state. And earlier this year, in no uncertain terms, he said that if elected president, he would ""crack down and not permit"" recreational cannabis in states that have legalized it.To date, four states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for adult use -- although D.C. still bans sales of the drug. As many as 10 more states are expected to consider legalization in the next several years.But marijuana, be it medical or recreational, remains prohibited under federal law, and states rely on guidance from the Department of Justice urging federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal operations -- something Christie evidently wants to reverse, at least when it comes to recreational legalization.""Instead of embracing the 'tough on drugs' rhetoric that got us into the war on drugs, Christie needs to join with the majority of Americans who recognize that taxing and regulating marijuana is a smarter way to deal with marijuana,"" Riffle said.Indeed, as multiple recent polls have found, a majority of Americans do not support the kind of hard-line federal crackdown Christie favors. Some of those dissenters are in Christie's own party. While most GOP voters still do not support marijuana legalization, a recent Pew survey found that 54 percent of Republicans believe individual states should be able to allow marijuana use without federal interference if they choose. And among younger Republicans, there is strong majority support for legalizing marijuana.   Also on HuffPost:  "

Stephen Orlando from Waterloo in Ontario, Canada captures violinists, violists, and cellists playing music as part of a photo series he has been working on. But, he explained to the Huffington Post in an email, the pictures capture much more than just the musician -- they also capture the bows' movements through captivating, colorful light trails. The images are stunning, and we know what you're thinking. No, they're not photoshopped. Orlando told HuffPost that the striking images, each of which were taken with a long exposure, were achieved by attaching LED lights to the musicians' bows. He then manipulated the colors with a microcontroller, a small computer programmed to produce the desired color patterns. The photographer also got to moving. ""A relative motion between the performer and camera must exist for the trails of light to traverse the frame,"" Orlando said, according to Colossal. ""I found it easier to move the camera during the shot rather than the performer.""The project was inspired by Gjon Mili, a photographer who had captured violin bowing through light painting in 1952. Orlando wanted to try his technique -- this time with modern lights. This isn't Orlando's first time using light painting photography. In addition to the musicians, he's also captured kayaking, hockey playing, and several other activities in motion.

9,POLITICS,Don't Like The New Climate Rules? Thank Congress.,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-climate-rules-emissions_us_55c127b8e4b0b75c1c8c79a6,"Legislators could have passed a climate change law to supplant Obama's regulations, but they didn't.",2015-08-04,"<p>Steam from the Jeffrey Energy Center coal-fired power plant is silhouetted against the setting sun near St. Marys, Kansas, on March 8, 2014.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Critics of the Obama administration's new rules for power plant emissions have been quick to describe them as ""government overreach"" and ""flagrantly unlawful."" What they don't say is that congressional inaction and a mandate from the Supreme Court drove the regulatory process to this point.The new rules limiting the emission of planet-warming greenhouse gases from power plants, which the Environmental Protection Agency finalized on Monday, were written under the Clean Air Act, a law originally adopted in 1970 to regulate sources of air pollution.From Obama's first days in office, his administration stressed that it did not want to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, describing it as a non-ideal way to address this type of pollution. But legal mechanisms were already in the works to force the Obama administration to do exactly that if Congress declined to issue new, greenhouse-gas-specific rules.Some historical context is helpful for understanding why and exactly how the new rules came to be.There are many significant dates when it comes to the history of regulating emissions. You could start in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson told Congress that ""a steady increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels"" was altering the composition of the atmosphere. You could start in 1988, when former NASA scientist James Hansen warned the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee it was ""time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here."" Or you could start in 1993, when President Bill Clinton tried, unsuccessfully, to put a tax on energy consumption in an effort to curb pollution.But we'll flash forward to the more recent history: the 2000 election. During the election, both Democratic candidate Al Gore and Republican candidate George W. Bush campaigned in favor of regulating carbon dioxide emissions. ""We will require all power plants to meet clean-air standards in order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide within a reasonable period of time,"" Bush said in September 2000.Bush went on to become president, and a few months after taking office, he reversed his position: he would not regulate emissions, citing rising energy prices and ""the incomplete state of scientific knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to, global climate change."" Bush's approach to climate change throughout his presidency consisted of waffling on the causes of climate change -- even as scientific studies demonstrated with mounting certainty that the burning of fossil fuels was the primary culprit -- and promoting voluntary, rather than mandatory, actions to cut emissions.A pair of senators stepped in to try to fill the void, as John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) introduced the bipartisan Climate Stewardship Act in January 2003. The bill aimed to reduce the emission of carbon and five other greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2016, using a cap-and-trade system.''The United States is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,'' McCain said at the time. ''It is time for the United States government to do its part to address this global problem, and a discussion of mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required.'' The Senate voted on the bill in October 2003, but it failed by a vote of 43 to 55. Reps. Wayne Gilchrest (R-Md.) and John Olver (D-Mass.) also introduced unsuccessful companion legislation in the House. McCain and Lieberman reintroduced their legislation in 2005, but it again failed to gain traction. And Lieberman -- by then, an independent -- tried again with Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) in 2007, introducing the Climate Security Act, a cap-and-trade bill they estimated would reduce emissions 70 percent by 2050. That bill, too, failed to muster enough votes to pass.But as all this action -- well, inaction -- was happening in Congress and the White House, a lawsuit from Massachusetts and a group of other states seeking to force the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act made its way to the Supreme Court. The court ruled in April 2007  that the Clean Air Act obligated the EPA to regulate any type of air pollution that ""may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,"" opening the door to the limits on greenhouse gases.But there were some hurdles. First, the EPA had to determine that greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change are an endangerment to human health. And the Bush EPA did reach that conclusion.Yet the White House declined to acknowledge it, even going so far as to refuse to open an email containing the finding so the administration wouldn't have to act on it. In July 2008, the White House extended the public comment period on the issue until the last days of the Bush presidency, effectively punting it to the next administration.Shortly after Obama took office, the new EPA moved forward with completing the assessment. Obama's first EPA chief, Lisa Jackson, issued the endangerment finding in April 2009, which she said would ""trigger the beginnings of regulation of CO2 for this country."" New rules for emissions from automobiles soon followed.But the Obama administration maintained that it preferred a new, carbon-specific law from Congress over regulating power plant emissions under the Clean Air Act. The 1970 law wasn’t crafted with climate change in mind. A new law from Congress would be more flexible and specific to greenhouse gases, the administration argued. There was a brief moment in 2009 when it seemed like a new law might happen. The House passed its own climate-specific legislation in June 2009, the Waxman-Markey American Clean Energy and Security Act. By all accounts, the bill was more flexible than EPA regulations and included a number of incentives to make it easier for major polluters to comply. The administration threw its weight behind that bill -- though whether the Obama administration tried hard enough or made climate enough of a priority is something I'll leave for activists and historians to debate.But action stalled when it hit the Senate. A ""tripartisan"" attempt at climate legislation from Lieberman, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) fell apart in April 2010, amid bickering over legislative priorities. By July 2010, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) snuffed out any remaining hope that a carbon cap would pass that year, concluding that they did not have the votes to make it happen.""We always viewed the [rule-making under the Clean Air Act ] as 'Plan B,'"" said Heather Zichal, who served as a top environmental adviser to Obama until October 2013. ""We were very forward-leaning, trying to work directly with Congress, trying to identify, in the very early years, Republicans in the Senate in particular we could work with.""As Obama entered his second term with little prospect for a climate bill, the administration turned its efforts to regulations through the EPA. ""He knew this was something that was very import to his legacy,"" said Zichal. ""Therefore, the push from him to his staff was to go figure out what is the best thing we can do.""Obama officially kicked off the power plant regulations in a speech in June 2013 directing EPA to issue the rules. ""We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury and sulfur and arsenic in our air or our water, but power plants can still dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the air for free. That’s not right, that’s not safe, and it needs to stop,"" said Obama. ""So today, for the sake of our children, and the health and safety of all Americans, I’m directing the Environmental Protection Agency to put an end to the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from our power plants, and complete new pollution standards for both new and existing power plants."" Beyond that, the Supreme Court ruling and the EPA's own endangerment finding legally compelled the agency to act. ""Once they made the endangerment finding, they had to move forward under the Clean Air Act,"" explained Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center. ""They had this authority, and this administration has clearly embraced it, given that a more comprehensive and tailored approach was defeated. They pledged to move forward with this, and that's what they did.""Yet that won't shield the administration from the inevitable lawsuits over the rules issued on Monday, which include standards for both new plants and plants already in operation that are responsible for approximately 40 percent of U.S. emissions. But it does likely mean that suits questioning the Obama administration EPA's very authority to issue the rules won't get very far, despite the flurry of press releases and announcements issued Monday. However, suits over the how the 1,560-page rule for existing power plants is constructed, the compliance timeline and the specifics of state requirements stand more of a chance of affecting the rule's trajectory.Environmental advocates remain confident that the rules will go forward. ""EPA is the expert agency Congress has tasked with reducing air pollution,"" said Joanne Spalding, managing attorney at the Sierra Club, in a call with reporters. ""The Supreme Court has already said that Congress charged EPA with the job of regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, just as it regulates other air pollutants."" "

""We will require all power plants to meet clean-air standards in order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide within a reasonable period of time,"" Bush said in September 2000.Bush went on to become president, and a few months after taking office, he reversed his position: he would not regulate emissions, citing rising energy prices and ""the incomplete state of scientific knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to, global climate change."" Bush's approach to climate change throughout his presidency consisted of waffling on the causes of climate change -- even as scientific studies demonstrated with mounting certainty that the burning of fossil fuels was the primary culprit -- and promoting voluntary, rather than mandatory, actions to cut emissions.A pair of senators stepped in to try to fill the void, as John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) introduced the bipartisan Climate Stewardship Act in January 2003. The bill aimed to reduce the emission of carbon and five other greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2016, using a cap-and-trade system.''The United States is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,'' McCain said at the time. ''It is time for the United States government to do its part to address this global problem, and a discussion of mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required.'' The Senate voted on the bill in October 2003, but it failed by a vote of 43 to 55. Reps. Wayne Gilchrest (R-Md.) and John Olver (D-Mass.) also introduced unsuccessful companion legislation in the House. McCain and Lieberman reintroduced their legislation in 2005, but it again failed to gain traction. And Lieberman -- by then, an independent -- tried again with Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) in 2007, introducing the Climate Security Act, a cap-and-trade bill they estimated would reduce emissions 70 percent by 2050. That bill, too, failed to muster enough votes to pass.But as all this action -- well, inaction -- was happening in Congress and the White House, a lawsuit from Massachusetts and a group of other states seeking to force the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act made its way to the Supreme Court. The court ruled in April 2007  that the Clean Air Act obligated the EPA to regulate any type of air pollution that ""may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,"" opening the door to the limits on greenhouse gases.But there were some hurdles. First, the EPA had to determine that greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change are an endangerment to human health. And the Bush EPA did reach that conclusion.Yet the White House declined to acknowledge it, even going so far as to refuse to open an email containing the finding so the administration wouldn't have to act on it. In July 2008, the White House extended the public comment period on the issue until the last days of the Bush presidency, effectively punting it to the next administration.Shortly after Obama took office, the new EPA moved forward with completing the assessment. Obama's first EPA chief, Lisa Jackson, issued the endangerment finding in April 2009, which she said would ""trigger the beginnings of regulation of CO2 for this country."" New rules for emissions from automobiles soon followed.But the Obama administration maintained that it preferred a new, carbon-specific law from Congress over regulating power plant emissions under the Clean Air Act. The 1970 law wasn’t crafted with climate change in mind. A new law from Congress would be more flexible and specific to greenhouse gases, the administration argued. There was a brief moment in 2009 when it seemed like a new law might happen. The House passed its own climate-specific legislation in June 2009, the Waxman-Markey American Clean Energy and Security Act. By all accounts, the bill was more flexible than EPA regulations and included a number of incentives to make it easier for major polluters to comply. The administration threw its weight behind that bill -- though whether the Obama administration tried hard enough or made climate enough of a priority is something I'll leave for activists and historians to debate.But action stalled when it hit the Senate. A ""tripartisan"" attempt at climate legislation from Lieberman, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) fell apart in April 2010, amid bickering over legislative priorities. By July 2010, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) snuffed out any remaining hope that a carbon cap would pass that year, concluding that they did not have the votes to make it happen.""We always viewed the [rule-making under the Clean Air Act ] as 'Plan B,'"" said Heather Zichal, who served as a top environmental adviser to Obama until October 2013. ""We were very forward-leaning, trying to work directly with Congress, trying to identify, in the very early years, Republicans in the Senate in particular we could work with.""As Obama entered his second term with little prospect for a climate bill, the administration turned its efforts to regulations through the EPA. ""He knew this was something that was very import to his legacy,"" said Zichal. ""Therefore, the push from him to his staff was to go figure out what is the best thing we can do.""Obama officially kicked off the power plant regulations in a speech in June 2013 directing EPA to issue the rules. ""We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury and sulfur and arsenic in our air or our water, but power plants can still dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the air for free. That’s not right, that’s not safe, and it needs to stop,"" said Obama. ""So today, for the sake of our children, and the health and safety of all Americans, I’m directing the Environmental Protection Agency to put an end to the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from our power plants, and complete new pollution standards for both new and existing power plants."" Beyond that, the Supreme Court ruling and the EPA's own endangerment finding legally compelled the agency to act. ""Once they made the endangerment finding, they had to move forward under the Clean Air Act,"" explained Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center. ""They had this authority, and this administration has clearly embraced it, given that a more comprehensive and tailored approach was defeated. They pledged to move forward with this, and that's what they did.""Yet that won't shield the administration from the inevitable lawsuits over the rules issued on Monday, which include standards for both new plants and plants already in operation that are responsible for approximately 40 percent of U.S. emissions. But it does likely mean that suits questioning the Obama administration EPA's very authority to issue the rules won't get very far, despite the flurry of press releases and announcements issued Monday. However, suits over the how the 1,560-page rule for existing power plants is constructed, the compliance timeline and the specifics of state requirements stand more of a chance of affecting the rule's trajectory.Environmental advocates remain confident that the rules will go forward. ""EPA is the expert agency Congress has tasked with reducing air pollution,"" said Joanne Spalding, managing attorney at the Sierra Club, in a call with reporters. ""The Supreme Court has already said that Congress charged EPA with the job of regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, just as it regulates other air pollutants."" "
