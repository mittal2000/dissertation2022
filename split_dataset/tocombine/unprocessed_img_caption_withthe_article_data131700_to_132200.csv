In short, it is a forgiving recipe.Too many recipes have you make a sugar/water/butter caramel sauce, top it with apples, cover the whole thing with pastry and bake. This yields a delicious apple tart with a caramelized surface, but it doesn't always work. And it is not what I mean when I say tarte Tatin, in which the apples are pretty well candied: There has been an exchange of apple juice (i.e. water) and sugar and the latter has penetrated the fruit, changing it while concentrating rather than obliterating its flavor. There's more science here than I understand, but the effect is quite a bit like magic.Heat your oven to 425 degrees F (just shy of 220 C). For an eight-inch tart -- enough for six portions or four with second helpings -- start with a ten-inch skillet: you'll cook the apples in this, and they will shrink enough to yield a smaller tart. Put a scant cup of sugar into the skillet along with a few tablespoons of water. As you peel, quarter, core and rinse your apples, toss them into the skillet; stop when it is generously filled with a well-packed single layer plus about another apple's worth. Five big apples or six/seven smaller ones will probably do it. I generally use a mixture of New York State apples or sometimes all one variety such as Winesaps, but use anything that won't fall apart the minute it starts to cook.I add vanilla at this stage: the scraped-out seeds from half a pod, plus the pod itself. This can be omitted, but it certainly makes for a tempting aroma. Over medium-low heat, I cook the apples, moving them around as they begin to exude juice and join the sugar to form a syrup; now I add two tablespoons of Cognac, again optional. Using a silicone spatula -- the kind that has a spoonlike concavity -- I turn the apples in the syrup from time to time as they cook. At a certain point perhaps fifteen to twenty-five minutes into the process, you will feel their texture change: it is as if they have puffed up. Now you need to keep your eyes open for the right degree of caramelization. The ""right"" degree, however, will depend on the water content of your apples: if there is a lot of liquid in the skillet, you can wait for a deep brown caramel to form, but if things start to look a little dry you can stop when it is a dark blond color -- it will darken in the baking anyway.Now I remove the vanilla pod, gently stir in three tablespoons of butter (salted preferably, but unsalted is fine so long as you add just a tiny bit of salt to the syrup) and add the apple quarters to a lightly buttered eight-inch non-stick skillet, rounded side down so it will look nice when unmolded. Once this neat layer is in place, just spoon the rest of the apples and syrup, including any broken pieces, on top and even the surface with a spatula.Top the skillet with a disk of buttery pastry, ideally puff pastry, though any butter pie dough will work; make sure the pastry goes a little beyond the rim of the skillet, because it will shrink in the baking. Place the skillet on a sheet pan to catch any drips and bake for 35 to 40 minutes until the pastry is beautifully brown.Put well-insulated oven mitts on both hands. On the turned-off stove or another heat-proof surface, give the skillet a shake to make sure that the tart is moving around, then cover with a serving plate, hold tight with both mitts, and quickly invert. Gently remove the skillet; any apple quarters that remain in the pan can be eased off with a spatula and put back in place.Take a good deep whiff, but be careful not to burn your nose: it is very hot. It's apple-y and buttery, with alluring vanilla and brandy aromas if you've added those ingredients.Serve tepid or at room temperature. Some people serve it with whipped cream or crème fraîche, but Jackie and I like it plain. And I think it's great cold for breakfast, but not everyone would agree."

The guidelines advise students on how to create a preferred digital image, respond to cyberbullying and adjust their social media privacy settings. They also warn students to be cautious of what they post online and to “pause before you post.” Jane Pook, the DOE’s executive director for digital communication policy and strategy, told The Huffington Post over the phone that demand for the guidelines came from students. ""[Students were telling us] ... we want to know what college admissions officers are looking at,"" said Pook. ""We realized it more than just addressing the children's needs as a middle school student or high school student, this is setting them up for success for their post-high school career.""According to Pook, the guidelines will be supplemented with professional development training for teachers, parents and parent coordinators, informing them how to bring these standards into the classroom and home. Through this training, Pook hopes conversations about the proper way to behave on social media will happen organically in schools. According to DNAInfo, the guide is based on recommendations from parents, school administrators and students; its release comes after the DOE issued a similar set of instructions in 2012 for department of education employees to follow on social media. In the future, the department hopes to release guidelines for students under the age of 13, according to New York outlet WABC-TV. ""To act like social media doesn't have a place in our classroom is ridiculous,"" teacher Jennifer Gunn told WABC. ""Our kids are using it so why not help them use it in a positive way.""Indeed, a Pew Internet study from May 2013 found eight in 10 online teens between the ages of 12 and 17 are on social media. The state of New Jersey is also taking steps to educate students about social media use. Earlier this month, the New Jersey Senate passed a bill that would require middle school students to take a course on how to use social media responsibly. The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that if the bill becomes law, students will start taking the course during the 2014 - 2015 school year. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated when social media guidelines were created for Department of Education staff. "
2,PARENTING,7 New Ways to Navigate Defiance From Your Child,"Sarah MacLaughlin, LSW, Contributor

You are so not alone.",2014-01-14,Attention-Seeking Children Are Better Learners Later On,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a571701900002500b85fd3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"There is something about your child looking you straight in the eye and saying, ""No, I won't do that,"" ""I hate you"" or ""You can't make me"" that challenges you to the core. You are so not alone. However, you can handle this annoying behavior better when your goal is to utilize your relationship with a child as motivation, rather than ineffective consequences and punishment. Here are seven strategies to help you stay composed when you are faced with defiant behavior from your kids. 1. Don't ever take it personally.  Your child is not refusing to eat breakfast to intentionally frustrate you. She is not saying ""No way"" about getting in the car to annoy. Rigid, defiant and ""off track"" behavior is a signal that your child is feeling disconnected. Children who behave ""badly"" are not doing it to ""get"" attention. They're doing it because they need attention and connection from you. Getting angry and controlling in this instance is about the worst thing you can do. 2. Consider why they refuse.  Imagine a day when you get up, and before you can even take a breath someone is telling you what to do. You're told what to wear, what to eat, when to leave the house, and on and on. I am not suggesting that we allow children to run the show. But trying on their perspective of close-to-zero autonomy can help you empathize with their desire for power, even if it's the power to defy. 3. Talk to yourself.  There is no better tool for staying calm than the use of positive self-talk. In order to pull off ""Don't take it personally,"" you will need to speak to yourself inwardly about what is happening in front of you. That means when your child says, ""I don't waaant to get dressed,"" and your first thought is, ""I DON'T CARE! GET DRESSED NOW!"" you can keep from saying that out loud, and instead use some helpful self-talk: ""Deep breath. Joey is refusing to get dressed and I want to yell, but I can stay calm."" Once you talk yourself out of behavior you don't want to engage in, you can talk yourself into responding more effectively. 4. Reflect and honor a child's feelings and meet them where they are.  Allow a child her feelings of rebellion and engage in a warm way. (Yes, this is actually possible after that kind chat you had with yourself.) Try narrating, ""You really don't want to get out of the car. I see your arms holding onto those car seat straps and you're probably thinking, 'No, no, no, I'm not getting out of the car!'"" What good does this do? It creates a pause, a gap in the anger spiral you might both whirl into. When you state ""what is"" in a calm manner, your child feels recognized. And because you didn't engage in any type of power struggle, there is no authority or control to react to, or push up against. 5. Hold boundaries on unsafe behavior only.  Here's what I mean by this: When your child loses it and their nervous system is overloaded -- there is no teachable moment. If they are freaking out about something, keep everyone safe and leave it at that until the storm has passed. Stop aggression with firm arms and say, ""I can't let you hit."" When they retaliate and yell, ""I hate you -- you're the worst mom in the whole world,"" do not try to now also put boundaries on their words. They have moved from a completely inappropriate way of expressing their stress and displeasure (hitting) to a more, albeit only slightly more, appropriate way (yelling mean things at you). Take the high road. Because you have a fully formed prefrontal cortex, you can.6. Keep a positive view of your child.  Know that raising respectful, kind, productive members of society is a marathon and not a sprint. This is another time for self-talk: ""My child is young and still learning. His brain is not done developing and he needs my gentle guidance."" Trust him to turn things around. Just because your child is refusing to leave the house at 3:30, doesn't mean he'll still be refusing at 3:40. Hold the vision that he will eventually comply with your request. 7. Use some humor and power play.  Humor, when used wisely, is a very valuable tool. Avoid sarcasm and teasing and aim for a silly, conspiratorial tone. If your child resists teeth-brushing, you could say: ""Hmm, mouth seems to be closed, guess I'll need to brush your nose and ears instead."" Watch them laugh as you do, and after enough giggles they'll likely comply. Power play is when you play games that give a child the more powerful role. ""Push Dad Over"" is a favorite in our house, as is ""Invited Defiance,"" where I build a block tower and beg that it not be knocked down, only to move through the build-beg-knock down process over and over. I know it's hard -- really, really hard -- to keep yourself regulated, calm and in a state of mind from which you can respond (instead of react) when things are fast spinning out of control. Remember that your children are learning how to handle themselves by watching you. These tips will help you keep your cool when tempers run hot and you'll see real results -- improvement in your relationship with your kids, and in their behavior.Also on HuffPost:"
