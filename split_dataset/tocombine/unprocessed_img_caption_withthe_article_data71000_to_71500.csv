Violent crime has been halved in recent decades. Once-deadly diseases have been eradicated, and treatment for others has taken leaps.Yet, though social and news media, the public imagination of death and dying has taken a turn -- for good and for bad. Since a gunman went on a killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, there have been more than 1,000 mass shootings in the U.S.As famed Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker once wrote in a Wall Street Journal essay based on his book, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,"" ""There will always be enough violent deaths to fill the evening news, so people's impressions of violence will be disconnected from its actual likelihood."" Candi Cann, an assistant professor at Baylor University who studies death and dying, said she believes the reaction to mass violence is often about individual and societal power. It reveals ""our powerlessness in a new way to us, and I think this is what is so terrifying about them,"" said Cann, author of ""Virtual Afterlives: Grieving the Dead in the Twenty-first Century.""“In reality, I don't think we do have power over death, but we have managed to create that illusion, so losing that is terrifying,"" Cann said. ""The idea of anonymity is terrifying, and mass shootings place the focus of the shooting on the perpetrator and not the victim, which runs counter to the narratives we like to construct about lives in the midst of death. In other words, dying at the hands of a mentally ill or disgruntled shooter brings a new sense of the absurd into our lives, and that is disruptive, and makes it more difficult to construct a meaning from death.”Expressing faith is one way people have tried to create meaning out of the pain. In the days following the San Bernardino shootings, prayers and vigils have flooded the American consciousness, online and in stadiums and houses of worship. Politicians who have expressed prayers while opposing gun control control laws have come under attack in the media for their show of faith, though experts say individual prayer can make a difference in the grieving process.“It gives people a way of being called to arms. Most people do not like the feeling of vulnerability and being able to do something brings a little peace and control to their world,” said Jane Bissler, former president of the Association for Death Education and Counseling and clinical director at Counseling for Wellness in Kent, Ohio.It’s also a powerful way to create community when it could easily feel like mass violence could tear friendships, cities and even a nation apart, said Jed Brubaker, an assistant professor at the College of Media, Communication and Information at the University of Colorado Boulder.“People often use religious language, like ‘rest in peace,’ and lots of heavenly references in how they think of death, especially on social media, these days. These might be religious expressions, but they are used in very secular ways,” said Brubaker, who has researched social media and death. “It’s a cultural way of situating yourself within your community, and it's comforting to people. It helps them cope to be able to feel the same feelings with others at the same time.”Also on HuffPost:"

Some were interested in promoting Christian morality, or improving national health and productivity. But American women, a group that gained political momentum over the latter half of the 19th century, were especially focused on eradicating saloon culture. Not everyone's motivations were entirely pure -- the primarily middle-class movement being tinged with some xenophobia and classism -- but, to many women, Prohibition meant cleaning up the behavior of men they called husbands and fathers. ""Having a husband who had a drinking problem could be a really serious issue,"" Juilliard professor Lisa Andersen told The Huffington Post. Saloons were where their husbands got drunk, spending the family's hard-earned money on beer or gambling. (Hilariously, the novelist Jack London once described saloons as places where ""men talked with great voices, laughed great laughs and there was an atmosphere of greatness."")

In defeating the saloon, however priggish their mission seemed, women hoped they could better protect the home. Prohibition, or the Noble Experiment, would come to be known as a failure: People drank anyway, many thoroughly, and newspaper headlines were littered with fresh incidents of gangster violence.

Outside those places, drinking during Prohibition was a much more ho-hum affair. Nonetheless, the image of carefree coed drinking was a compelling one that would be immortalized in movies and other media for decades.With saloons out of business, ""the rules of the past [went] out the window with it,"" journalist Daniel Okrent, author of Last Call: The Rise And Fall Of Prohibition, told HuffPost. ""Then it [became] kind of sporting for men and women to go [drink] together."" Speakeasies made adjustments to attract patrons of both sexes, including offering table service so women needn't go up to the bar. They played music. People danced.

Increasingly, drinking became a social pastime for men and women alike -- and, more importantly, something they could do together. Were it not for Prohibition, it's difficult to say when widespread co-ed public drinking and socializing would have turned into a popular pastime. Saloons would have likely died out eventually. Gender relations were already quickly changing, most notably when women finally won the right to vote beginning in 1920 -- the same year Prohibition went into effect.Technological advances also would have likely created more social drinking opportunities for women even without Prohibition, as more people bought refrigerators, and canned beer made at-home drinking more convenient.""Absolutely, the saloon would have disappeared,"" Okrent said.

Santos also tweeted a video showing a search team at sea.The president called the find, located off Cartagena's coast, “a milestone for our underwater cultural heritage.""Though the war behind the ship’s downfall may be history, a modern-day legal battle over the shipwreck’s booty has been ongoing for several decades.U.S.-based salvage company Sea Search Armada has been actively searching for the legendary treasure since the early 1980s. When it sank, the ship was carrying between $4 billion and $17 billion in gold and silver meant to help fund France's ongoing war against Britain, according to SSA. Between 1980 and 1983, SSA Managing Director Jack Harbeston claims the company spent more than $10 million on surveying the ocean floor -- in addition to $2 million to $3 million over the next 28 years to ""defend"" the company's rights to it.Harbeston, in an email to The Huffington Post, said the legal trouble began when the company made a pact with the Colombian government, promising that they would split any treasure collected from the wreckage.When SSA later found what it believed to be the shipwreck's location and shared its coordinates with government officials, he says the government went back on that promise and further prohibited the company from visiting the site, going so far as to threaten ""military force"" should investigators return.SSA consequently filed a lawsuit against the government in 1989, asserting its claim to the wreckage.""Our thirty years of fighting for our rights in Colombia has led us to conclude that you can't believe a single thing the [Colombian government] says about the San Jose and our rights to it,"" Harbeston said.In a major blow to the determined treasure hunters, a U.S. court in 2011 ruled that the SSA had missed the statute of limitations to sue for its right to the treasure. The group has since appealed that ruling.According to Santos' office, the ship was discovered on Nov. 27 in an area that was not referenced by previous studies and searches.Harbeston argues that if that's the case, why block the company from returning to the sites it previously visited?""If, as the [Colombian government] claims, there is nothing at the sites disclosed to it by SSA, why wouldn't it let us visit the sites? If we visited our sites and found nothing then the game was over for SSA; we would fold our tent and leave. The [Colombian government] would be rid of us,"" he said.Also on HuffPost:"
6,POLITICS,The Big Problem With The New York Times' Gun Editorial,Nick Baumann,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-gun-control-editorial_us_5662644ee4b08e945fefbb50,It ignores most gun violence.,2015-12-05,"In April 2007, a gunman killed 32 people at Virginia Tech. He used handguns. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Saturday, The New York Times printed a front-page editorial -- its first since 1920 -- calling for greater restrictions on gun ownership in the United States. You can read the piece here, but be warned: It's deeply flawed.The Times doesn't use the term, but the policy it's advocating is what's generally called an assault weapons ban. Assault weapons bans are hard to write and implement, and easy to undermine and circumvent. Even a perfect assault weapons ban wouldn't do anything about most gun violence, because most gun violence involves handguns that aren't forbidden under such laws.The Times' editorial board claims, without evidence or argument, that ""it is possible to define"" ""in a clear and effective way"" ""certain kinds of weapons ... and certain kinds of ammunition, [that] must be outlawed for civilian ownership."" But previous laws targeting ""certain kinds of weapons"" in the U.S. have generally failed to achieve their goals. The federal assault weapons ban passed in the 1990s was riddled with loopholes, and a Justice Department-funded study found little evidence it saved lives. And, as my colleague Daniel Marans reported Friday, the shooters who killed 14 people in San Bernardino on Wednesday used legally purchased rifles that escaped California's assault weapons ban because of a loophole.Regular readers of The New York Times already know about the problems with assault weapons bans: Last year, the paper co-published a story by ProPublica's Lois Beckett on the subject. The Times headlined it ""The Assault Weapons Myth."" And as Beckett reported in another story, even gun control groups such as the Brady Campaign for Gun Violence and Everytown for Gun Safety have de-emphasized assault-weapons bans, opting to focus their attention on measures that are more likely to be effective at preventing gun violence. There's a good reason for gun-control groups' caution: As Beckett noted in her piece, most gun violence in America involves handguns. But the Times editorial does nothing to deal with that hard truth. The word handgun does not appear in the piece. To the Times' credit, it mentions that its plan would require some gun owners to give up their weapons. But it doesn't explain how the government would go about getting people to surrender them. There are 300 million guns in American homes. Confiscating even a small percentage of these -- the Times' ""certain weapons"" -- would be an enormous, dangerous, and politically fraught undertaking. Banning civilians from owning ""certain kinds of ammunition,"" as the Times also suggests, would be even harder.Perhaps most glaringly, though, this editorial fails to mention that electoral politics -- specifically Republicans' dominance of the U.S. Congress and the fact that some Democrats seem to be more afraid of the NRA than they are of gun control groups -- is the biggest reason why President Barack Obama wasn't able to pass even modest gun control measures in the wake of the Newtown massacre. Congressional Democrats tried pushing new gun control measures again on Thursday, by the way. Republicans blocked them all. But ""if you want gun control, vote for liberal Democrats for Congress"" would be a short editorial.Also on HuffPost:"

Tjikko began to sprout an estimated 9,550 years ago, when the United Kingdom was still connected to Europe by an ice bridge and glaciers were only just beginning to recede across Scandinavia. It lived anonymously until 2004, when geologist Leif Kullman discovered and named Tjikko (after his dead dog). Scientists then carbon dated the tree's root system, which is actually thousands of years older than the actual tree you see above ground. Because of the mountain's harsh weather, Tjikko survived in shrub form and has only just grown into a full-fledged tree in the last century. With a just a handful leafy branches and a slightly crooked, skinny trunk, Tjikko is the real life example of Charlie Brown's much-loved lopsided Christmas tree.The discovery of Tjikko nudged out California's Methuselah, a bristlecone pine tree from the White Mountains, as the elder statesman. At almost 5,000 years old, the gnarled Methuselah (which would fit right in at Hogwarts as the Whomping Willow) is a well-kept California Forest Service secret since, in 1964, a slightly older tree was accidentally felled by a scientist who didn't know just how old it was. While Tjikko is the oldest single-stemmed tree in the world, it behind Pando, a Utah forest made entirely of one tree's clones, covering 107 acres--and estimated to be between 80,000 and 100,000 years old.See more on holiday travel on CNTraveler.comMore from Condé Nast Traveler:25 Things You Absolutely, Positively Have to Do in LondonThe Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities in the WorldThe Most Beautiful Island in the World25 Things You Absolutely, Positively Have to Do in New York City50 Things to Do in America Before You DieAlso on HuffPost:Correction: This post originally described the roots as hundreds of thousands of years older than the tree itself, when in fact it is thousands of years older."

As global education systems scramble to find better ways to teach international perspectives and intercultural competence to the first generation of world citizens, Kumari appears to be in the right place at an historic time. ""Many schools ask themselves these days how they can develop not just sound disciplinary competency, but also character qualities such as courage, integrity, curiosity, leadership, resilience and empathy. The IB schools have a long track record with this,"" comments Andreas Schleicher, Director for Education and Skills and Special Advisor on Education Policy to the OECD Secretary General. It was in the 1960's that the IB's innovative curriculum began to take shape. John Goormaghtigh, a Holocaust survivor and founding President of the IBO Council of Foundation, wanted to help create a world where understanding and peace would prevail. Talented educators were drawn to the IB, such as Alec Peterson OBE (the first Director General in 1968) who proposed what is today known as the 'Creativity, Action and Service' component of the IB's Diploma Programme, and the IB's 'Theory of Knowledge'. Gerard Renaud (Director General in 1977) continued development and implementation of the Theory of Knowledge - or TOK as it is called, which enables students to see the important connections between different disciplines. Siva Kumari joined the IB in April 2009 as its Regional Director for Asia-Pacific. A year later she was named its first Chief Operating Officer, and last year, its seventh Director General. In The Global Search for Education interview that follows, she discusses the IB's philosophical heritage, its work today with students, and her vision for its future role in the world. ""We work with our teachers, students and schools all around the world, we practice both deep local pride in an individual's culture and a connection to global issues.""  -- Siva KumariThe UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development offers very ambitious and necessary goals. How can the IB education encompass the UN goals of prosperity, equality and environmental consciousness, and integrate them into the classroom?We believe there is a link between what you teach kids and how they influence the world through understanding real world issues. Our mission is to develop such human beings, who make the world a better place, through education.Education is essential to equality -- to enable a level playing field. IB students are encouraged to train their minds and to use knowledge and empathy to solve local and global problems in new ways, not to merely learn the best way to ""top"" exams.The IB's continuum of programmes offer a holistic curriculum--at the core of the Diploma Programme (DP), for example, are Theory of Knowledge, and Creativity Activity Service. These are mind-expanding activities, unique in secondary education, which link ideas to actions and consequences. And ""Individuals and Societies"" is one of the subject groups--in both the Diploma and the Middle Years Programmes--in which students explore the specific issues you refer to: ecological consciousness, equality and the barriers to worldwide prosperity.So the IB has concerns for humanity hardwired into it, in its philosophical heritage, its mission, and today's curricula. As the first woman to lead the IB, how do you see the present state of gender equality in education? What achievements have we seen; what is left to be done?Although much has been achieved in recent years, gender inequality still haunts our world. We believe our educational programmes can help to close the gender gap. For example, we do extensive analysis to evaluate whether our exams bias children of one gender over another. But what is left to be done is still vast. ""Education is about teaching students to think, to stretch and to develop themselves, on the basis of rational thought, self-discipline, research and inquiry--and, not least, the deep instincts for justice and equality which are natural to 99% of the world's citizens."" -- Siva KumariThe IB has already made significant inroads into global understanding and citizenship. Can the IB build on this foundation to bring internationally diverse peoples closer together and help foster peaceful relations among nations?Of course we can. We must. Our children are growing up globally conscious more than ever and world events, as we know today, can have both immediate and trickle effects in other parts of this highly interconnected world. The IB's founders, however, recognized the impact of international-mindedness from the beginning and, because we started with schools around the world 50 years ago, our organization has developed deep fluency in the practice of these concepts in schools around the world. Nearly every day, the IB brings educators together internationally. Since we work with our teachers, students and schools all around the world, we practice both deep local pride in an individual's culture and a connection to global issues. This allows our students to be deep thinkers who are ambidextrous in their thinking. They can think about their context and how those issues may or may not be connected to global issues. The important learning aspect for me is that the IB schools and their teachers are able to deploy the IB in ways that make sense locally while upholding international standards. This gives the IB student a different kind of high-value currency than most of their peers. Our students are great ambassadors for mindful leadership. Since they are taught to address complex problems both through the curricula and through internationally competitive assessments, they are prepared to ""soft land"" into the world. We believe the IB's responsibility is to advocate education's role in developing young minds to address serious issues, and we believe that our students use that preparation to address global issues carefully, as great leaders in whatever setting they choose.  ""We teach students to analyze and adapt their patterns of thought and how they act on them. It is about living life consciously and reflectively; this requires habits to be honed throughout their school years."" -- Siva KumariFrom your experience with students and teachers, what are the most crucial needs for education leading up to 2030? How can the IB fill those needs? I could talk about soft skills, the digital revolution, the environment, and the challenge of teaching children to live lives and work in jobs which don't yet exist--but I'd like to build on a broader context.In its essence, education is about teaching students to think, to stretch and to develop themselves, on the basis of rational thought, self-discipline, research and inquiry--and, not least, the deep instincts for justice and equality which are natural to 99% of the world's citizens.The IB is not about teaching students to regurgitate memorized facts, or to implement pre-defined systems of learning. We teach students to analyze and adapt their patterns of thought and how they act on them. It is about living life consciously and reflectively; this requires habits to be honed throughout their school years.I believe an education should equip students to thrive and prosper in the world, no matter the focus of their interest or their chosen area of achievement; it is to help create better lives, to inspire them to give of their best and to make the most of their lives--in whichever way is best for them. The power of each individual to make change should not be ignored by educators or by the IB.And excellence in education is about bringing the most rigorous standards and research to bear on creating curricula which open and free students' minds, by giving brilliant teachers and schools the support to operate at the very top of their game, letting all their passion and commitment flow to inspire their students.The IB is not into constant change in educational philosophies that leave teachers baffled. This approach has served us well for nigh-on 50 years, and it will serve us equally well for the 50 years to come. These unwavering ideas will drive the IB to meet the educational challenges of 2030 and beyond, and to help make the world a better place.(All pictures are courtesy of the International Baccalaureate Organization)Please watch my interview with Siva Kumari at the IB Heads World Conference in The Hague C.

These unwavering ideas will drive the IB to meet the educational challenges of 2030 and beyond, and to help make the world a better place.(All pictures are courtesy of the International Baccalaureate Organization)Please watch my interview with Siva Kumari at the IB Heads World Conference in The Hague C.

13,ENTERTAINMENT,Friday Talking Points -- GOP Begins to Freak Out Over Trump,"Chris Weigant, ContributorPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/friday-talking-points_b_8724828.html,"Trump can say pretty much anything at this point -- which he's proven time and time again. They that have sown the wind are now reaping the Trump whirlwind. We've said it before, and we'll no doubt say it again -- this couldn't have happened to a nicer political party!",2015-12-05,"Republican presidential candidate, businessman Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio, Monday, Nov. 23, 2015. (AP Photo/Paul Vernon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4d6d32100006401c8238f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We took last week off for the holidays, so we've got a lot of ground to cover today. Sadly, this included two terrorist attacks in America, one in Colorado and one in Southern California. The truly sad part is that these mass shootings are becoming so common nowadays that within a few months most people will have forgotten them, as we all focus on fresher, more recent tragedies. Welcome to a very grim ""new normal,"" in other words. Sorry to start off on such a heavy note, but such news is impossible to ignore.Moving along to more lighthearted fare, the Republican presidential race is still as amusing as ever, with no sign yet that Donald Trump is heading for any sort of inevitable collapse in the polls. In fact, he's actually gaining ground. CNN released a poll this week showing Trump at a whopping 36 percent, a full 20 points higher than his nearest competitor. Most of this rise is coming at the expense of Ben Carson, who seems to be fading fast. Carson is now essentially tied with Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, in the mid-teens. Even more stunning, Jeb! Bush has dropped to a measly three percent, after his super PAC poured almost $30 million down the advertising rathole. With Carson flailing, this means that in all likelihood the Republican nominee will be either Rubio, Cruz, or Trump. And the most likely scenario is that Donald Trump becomes the Republican standard-bearer. We're officially through the looking glass, folks.Some Republicans are finally waking up to this reality, and reacting in various amusing ways. Some are openly predicting a Barry Goldwater-sized electoral disaster. Some are beginning to openly call Trump a fascist. John Kasich is running a brutal ad which essentially compares Donald Trump to the Nazis. Lindsey Graham has apparently decided that, since he has no chance of winning the nomination, he might as well just go ahead and say what he feels about Trump. Earlier in the week he was quoted calling Trump a ""xenophobic, race-baiting, religious bigot,"" and last night Graham told an audience: ""I believe Donald Trump is destroying the Republican Party's chances to win in an election that we can't afford to lose. You think you're gonna win an election with that kind of garbage?!""None of it has mattered. Trump can say pretty much anything at this point -- which he's proven time and time again. They that have sown the wind are now reaping the Trump whirlwind. We've said it before, and we'll no doubt say it again -- this couldn't have happened to a nicer political party! In fact, there's only one Republican who is now enjoying himself no matter what happens on the campaign trail -- because Scott Walker has already stopped running (freeing up lots of time for doing much more fun things than dealing with Trump).In non-Trump campaign news, Ted Cruz jumped to the most bizarre conclusion heard after the Colorado shooting. The shooter, according to Cruz (and based on pure malarkey), was nothing short of a ""transgender leftist activist."" Cruz also took the time to share his experiences buying rubbers when in college, for some inexplicable reason. Ben Carson, meanwhile, took a quick trip to a refugee camp in the Middle East, and then returned back home to speak to a group of Jewish activists, where he warned of the threat of ""hummus,"" apparently mistaking chickpea purée for Hamas. Lindsey Graham (yes, he's still running, officially) engaged in a bit of truth-telling, knocking other Republican candidates: ""If you are going to tell a woman who has been raped that she has to carry the child of the rapist, you're going to lose most Americans. If the Republican nominee won't allow an exception for rape or incest, they will lose."" Of course, Republicans voting in primaries probably won't listen to such sage advice.Things have been pretty quiet on the Democratic side of things, mostly as Democrats everywhere sit back and watch the continuing trainwreck that is the Republican nomination fight. In recent head-to-head polling, Hillary Clinton defeats the entire Republican field. So does Bernie Sanders, and by even wider margins. That's right -- Sanders is more electable than Clinton!What else? We got another good jobs report today, with 211,000 new jobs created last month. Unemployment stayed stable at five percent. Congress is right now in a frenzy of ""doing what they should have been doing during all those vacation weeks they took,"" but we're going to wait until next week to focus on that circus, personally.One last interesting note before we get on with the awards (and a very special talking points section) -- immigration is going to be a huge issue next summer, right in the middle of the presidential campaign. This is now virtually assured by the Supreme Court denying the delaying tactics Texas was attempting, in order to push the issue out past the election (into the Supreme Court's next term, in other words). Because of this decision, it's almost certain the case of President Obama's new immigration policy will be decided by June -- which puts it right at the start of the general election campaign. So there's that to look forward to, a half a year from now. OK, that's enough, let's get on with things.Our Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week this week is a Missouri state representative, Stacey Newman.Her response to the recent shootings is the best we've come across. From the story:A Missouri lawmaker is introducing a bill that would subject gun buyers in the state to the same kind of restrictions that women face if they choose to have an abortion.This bill is pure political grandstanding, we should note, because it's simply not going to pass. However, it is also an excellent piece of political theater, pointing out the hypocrisy of those that call themselves ""pro-life."" As Newman put it, ""If the appetite is for more and more reproductive restrictions, then it makes sense if to apply those to gun purchases.""In Washington, the Senate just voted down two amendments that would have stopped some of the loopholes in the background check system and denied gun purchases to those on the terrorism watch list. Both were also symbolic, to get Republicans on the record opposing them. But in our opinion, Newman's symbolic measure was even more pointed, which is why she's the winner of this week's MIDOTW award. Well done, Representative Newman![Congratulate Missouri Representative Stacey Newman on her contact page, to let her know you appreciate her efforts.]The level of corruption in Albany, New York is at such a high rate that it's almost tough for a crooked politician to get noticed. Salon had a handy rundown of recent history in New York's capital:Meanwhile, 30 lawmakers have left office because of criminal charges or allegations of ethical misconduct since 2000. The Senate's former No. 2 member, Republican Thomas Libous, was sentenced to house arrest last week for lying to the FBI. Ex-Senate Leader Dean Skelos, R-Long Island, currently is on trial for charges that he extorted bribes and jobs for his son.But even with all that stiff competition, former speaker of the state Assembly Sheldon Silver stood out this week. He was just convicted in federal court of ""fraud, extortion, and money-laundering,"" to the tune of $4 million in illegal bribes and kickbacks -- some extorted from a cancer researcher. Got that? Money that should have gone to curing cancer went into Silver's pocket instead. It's hard to imagine anything sleazier, really.We gave Silver his first Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award back in January. Now that he's been found guilty, we're taking the opportunity to hand him his second one.There's a reason why the first-ever Museum Of Political Corruption is being organized in Albany. That reason is that it's hard to even stand out among the fetid swamp of corruption that is New York's capital. But with this verdict, Sheldon Silver managed to do that this week.[Sheldon Silver is no longer a sitting official, and it's our policy to not provide contact information for private individuals.]Volume 371 (12/4/15)Before we begin (and because we didn't know where else to stick it), we have two program notes. The first is that I was interviewed this morning on Talk910, a San Francisco Bay Area radio station, so if you'd like to hear me waffle on about Trump and Carson, check it out (my bit starts about 77 minutes in)! The second is that it is our holiday fundraising season, once again. With all that out of the way, let's move along to the talking points.We have a very special talking points section this week, because all of them come straight from Republicans. It's our way of offering sympathy to all those in the Republican Party who now stand horrified at the Frankenstein's monster they have created in Donald Trump.The first four of these come from the extraordinary internal Republican memo leaked this week to the Washington Post. The memo was written by Ward Baker, who has the unenviable job of trying to get Republicans elected (and re-elected) to the Senate. The entire memo consists of advice for candidates on what to do if Trump does become the Republican nominee. One line sums up the thrust of the memo: ""Understand the populist points Trump makes and ride that wave.""The next two talking points are from various Republican officials reacting to the prospect of a Trump nomination, especially on how it would affect all the down-ballot races. Remember, all of these talking points are from Republicans. We can afford to do this because Republicans are doing such a great job of bad-mouthing Trump right now that no Democratic help is even necessary. Here's a bonus talking point from the article, by way of example: ""If he carries this message into the general election in Ohio, we'll hand this election to Hillary Clinton -- and then try to salvage the rest of the ticket."" With Republicans saying stuff like that, all Democrats have to do is repeat such great lines.Are you a journalist who wants to watch a Republican squirm in fear? Or maybe you just like teasing your Republican friends and relatives? It's easy to do, right now. All you have to do is ask them a very simple and straightforward question: ""If Donald Trump becomes the nominee of your party, will you wholeheartedly support him?"" Some of the Republican candidates are already getting asked this question, and dodge it though they may, it's going to be very interesting to see what happens if Trump starts actually winning primaries and caucuses. So keep asking the question to every Republican you meet! Over time, the answers should get more and more panicky, that's for sure. Never, everAs mentioned, the first four of these are from that Republican senatorial campaign memo. This was the very first bullet point from the memo, and it paints a very grim picture for Republicans.Trump is a Misguided Missile. Let's face facts. Trump says what's on his mind and that's a problem. Our candidates will have to spend full time defending him or condemning him if that continues. And, that's a place we never, ever want to be. Farcical fitsOnce again, this is not parody -- this is straight from the Republican establishment.Show your Independence. As we know, Trump is subject to farcical fits. You can still obey the ""run your own campaign"" edict, while still taking Trump to task on outrageous statements where the media won't let you off the hook. Trump-liteThe basic theme of the memo is to become Trump-lite. Agree with Trump on everything while at the same time condemning everything he says -- hey, that shouldn't be too hard, right?Trump Can Hit The Right Chord. We may not like it, but Trump has connected with voters on issues like trade with China and America's broken borders.... Trump will continue to advance those messages, but you don't have to go along with his more extreme positioning. Instead, you should stake out turf in the same issue zone and offer your own ideas. A big problemHouston? Are you there? Hello? Anybody?Trump and Women. Houston, we have a problem: Donald Trump has said some wacky things about women. Candidates shouldn't go near this ground other than to say that your wife or daughter is offended by what Trump said. We do not want to reengage the ""war on women"" fight so isolate Trump on this issue by offering a quick condemnation of it. Trump, unmolestedThis comes from ""a prominent Republican senator"" who chose to remain nameless, quaking in fear over what Trump would say about him or her in retaliation. Senator Nameless was asked about Trump's effect on Senate races in places like New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.There is not a bit of confusion among our members that if Donald Trump is the nominee, we're going to get wiped out. Until somebody with A, the money, and B, the incentive to step up comes along, I worry he kind of glides along unmolested. Tell us how you really feel, Lindsey!Here's the full quote from Lindsey Graham, also talking about all those down-ballot races.It would be an utter, complete and total disaster. If you're a xenophobic, race-baiting, religious bigot, you're going to have a hard time being president of the United States, and you're going to do irreparable damage to the party. Kasich goes full GodwinAnd finally, we close with the text of that ad John Kasich has been airing. The following lines obviously are an homage to a very famous statement made after World War II. It's the most forceful attack on Trump that anyone's yet made, but it likely won't make a bit of difference.You might not care if Donald Trump says Muslims should register with their government, because you're not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump says he's going to round up all the Hispanic immigrants, because you're not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump says it's okay to rough up black protesters, because you're not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump wants to suppress journalists, because you're not one. But think about this: If he keeps going, and he actually becomes president, he might just get around to you. And you better hope there's someone left to help you.Chris Weigant blogs at: Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

On Capitol Hill, the living has become easy: a comms director tells the staff social media intern, ""Tweet something about prayers,"" and the day rolls on.

And closer to home, a few lawmakers have hit upon one of those small ideas that make a big difference -- a way to help working class parents make ends meet by providing them with diapers, a product that poor parents spend an astonishing portion of their income procuring. Joining us to discuss this is Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.).Meanwhile, in Washington, a big winner has emerged in the fight to pass a highway funding bill and, naturally, it's an obscure bank with enough lobbying clout to get key lawmakers to just hand it money.

Greg Abbott (R) says the state has the authority to reject Syrian refugees.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5661d1551700000a01e1b2e0.jpeg?cache=rLCV7m9FZx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Texas will allow some Syrians to resettle in the state in coming days, officials said on Friday -- but they won't drop their lawsuit aimed at keeping out refugees in general. Hours after the Obama administration and a Dallas refugee resettlement group filed legal responses in opposition to Texas' lawsuit, the state attorney general Ken Paxton withdrew a request for an emergency hearing and instead asked that the court hold a hearing next week. The decision clears the way for two Syrian families who were already scheduled to move to Texas this weekend. Paxton said in a statement that the state had received additional information about those refugees from the federal government, ​although he did not elaborate on what they had asked for.But the legal battle will continue over whether Texas has the authority to keep other Syrian refugees out of the state. On Friday morning, the federal government and International Rescue Committee filed a legal response in opposition to Texas' suit, asking the courts not to agree to a temporary injunction that would keep Syrian families from resettling in the state.The lawsuit is the latest in an ongoing effort by governors, most of them Republican, to keep out Syrian refugees based on purported security concerns. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced last month, soon after terrorist attacks in Paris, that he would no longer allow Syrian refugees into his state. Most other governors similarly voiced opposition to Syrian refugees.IRC, like several other refugee groups, said it would continue to resettle Syrians over the governors' objections. Texas' lawsuit against the federal government and IRC accuses them of failing to cooperate and collaborate with the state, as required by law.That argument is ""nonsensical,"" according to Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, which is representing IRC, along with Southern Poverty Law Center and National Immigration Law Center. ""Texas is decreeing that cooperation means Texas gets a unilateral veto and can instruct one of these non-profit organizations to discriminate against a group of refugee families solely based on their nationality,"" she told The Huffington Post. ""That is just completely backwards and contrary to the federal law."" Several experts have said that governors don't have the authority to block Syrian refugees, or the legal right to discriminate against them. The federal government sets immigration policy, so governors cannot tell the Obama administration who to admit as refugees. In its filing, the federal government argued that Texas had failed to make a case for why it would be harmful to admit Syrian refugees to the state. All refugees go through an extensive screening program. ""Since fiscal year 2011, 243 Syrian refugees have resettled in Texas,"" it reads. ""Yet Plaintiff does not explain how these specific refugees -- mostly children, their parents, and in one case their grandparents -- pose a danger to anyone anywhere, let alone to the State of Texas.""Syrian refugee resettlement has continued amid the backlash, although one family that was supposed to move to Indiana last month was sent elsewhere because of opposition from Republican Gov. Mike Pence. The ACLU sued Pence last month over his plan to suspend admission of Syrian refugees. Also on HuffPost:"
20,POLITICS,A Lot Of Americans Think Abortion Is Just As Bad As Attacking Abortion Clinics,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americans-abortion-poll_us_5661e77be4b08e945fef5d88,"Most Americans say the Colorado Planned Parenthood shooting was an act of terrorism, but some feel abortion providers are no better.",2015-12-04,"A Colorado Springs Police officer guards the entrance to the Planned Parenthood where a shooting occurred on Nov. 30, 2015.

Just 3 percent of Americans say that it is ever justifiable to use violence to prevent abortions, and just 4 percent that it is morally acceptable.That's also the stance taken by anti-abortion groups, which were quick to speak out against the shooting as antithetical to their principles.""The pro-life movement works to protect the right to life and increase respect for human life,"" the National Right to Life Committee said in a statement. ""The unlawful use of violence is directly contrary to that goal.""But Americans who believe that both abortion and anti-abortion violence are morally wrong -- a group that makes up 45 percent of those polled -- largely view the clinics that provide abortions as morally equivalent to the people who attack those clinics. Among that group, just 29 percent say that people who take violent action against abortion providers are more in the wrong morally than those providers are. Sixty percent see the two groups' actions as equivalent, while 8 percent view abortion providers as worse.That adds up to about 31 percent of all Americans who, while they don't condone acts like the shooting in Colorado Springs, see them as no worse than the abortion providers they target.But the poll also found that support for legal abortions and for Planned Parenthood remains the majority position.Fifty-three percent of Americans polled said abortion should generally or always be legal, with an equal percentage holding a favorable opinion of Planned Parenthood. Fifty-two percent said that the Colorado Springs shooting counts as an act of terrorism.Concern about the heated rhetoric surrounding abortion is also high. Just under half of respondents said the actions of groups opposing abortion encourage violence at abortion clinics, while only 27 percent say they aren't a contributing factor.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 3-Dec. 6 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

If there was someone in there with a concealed weapon that guy would have been shot down.""",2015-12-04,1981: The Attempted Assassination Of President Ronald Reagan,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587a8abe1200002d00ad7981.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Joe Arpaio, the self-styled “toughest” sheriff in America, has a solution to mass shootings and terrorism: Gun-wielding citizens need to step up to the plate.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, said law enforcement officers alone cannot battle the scourge of violence plaguing the country. As such, he’s beseeching the 250,000 gun owners in Arizona to do their part.“I'm just talking about the areas where you have large crowds and someone pulls out the gun and starts shooting. Maybe somebody with a concealed weapon takes the guy down,” Arpaio said, according to KPHO-TV.To make his point, the controversial sheriff cited the example of last week's shooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood, when a 57-year-old man killed three people.“I’m concerned about what's going on. Just think about Colorado. If there was someone in there with a concealed weapon that guy would have been shot down,” said Arpaio.The sheriff’s idea of using armed civilians to battle terrorism is one that he’s actively put into practice.Since 1993, when Arpaio was elected sheriff, he’s been running an armed civilian posse program, which involves local gun owners patrolling areas in their communities.Back in 2013, in the weeks after the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Arpaio announced that thousands of armed civilians would be deployed to “protect” regions surrounding dozens of Phoenix-area schools.Over the weekend, the sheriff announced that the posse would be patrolling local malls this holiday season “to provide law enforcement protection to shoppers.”He noted, however, that even “the volunteer posse can’t do it alone.”All of Arizona's civilian gun owners need “to take action in the event a terror attack or other violence occurs until law enforcement arrives,” he said in a press release.That way, terrorists “with evil intent entering large gatherings, including shopping malls, should be worried about armed citizens who will be ready to defend themselves and others.”Arpaio's strategy has been met with strong disapproval from some in the Arizona law enforcement community. Steve Henry, chief deputy of the sheriff's office in neighboring Pinal County, told KPHO that the actions of armed, but untrained, civilians could pose an increased risk to innocent bystanders. “Sometimes it's not proper to pull the trigger because the collateral damage is not worth it,” Henry said. “We don't want to walk into a gun fight between anybody, much less a gun fight where people are untrained.”A January 2013 Huffington Post survey of Arizona readers found that roughly two-thirds of respondents said they did not feel safer after Arpaio's deployment of armed civilians to local schools. “I feel innocent people will be hurt or killed. I wouldn't want [the volunteers] patrolling my neighborhood,” one reader said at the time.  Also on HuffPost:"

It's the last stop in a three-day, 16-county swing. Time for one more joke. He goes for a fan favorite, the one about the White House jumper. But this time he tweaks the punchline just a bit, perhaps more for himself than anybody there. “You may have missed it, but actually this morning, a second person was climbing the fence of the White House,” Cruz says, pausing for effect. “The Secret Service ran up and said, 'Not yet Hillary! Not yet! And not ever!”He delivers the line with a chuckle and a smirk as the crowd erupts in laughter.The first-term senator’s stump speech closely resembles a stand-up comedy routine, drawing on the ample use of gestures, strong facial expressions and a variety of vocal inflections and pauses; it repeats the same laugh lines over and over, with the same fervor each time, often picking out voters in the audience and addressing them directly. It has gotten him in trouble in the past, like when he joked about Joe Biden just after his son passed away, and when he cracked wise about gun control immediately after the massacre in Charleston, South Carolina. This is the cost of Cruz's machine-like approach to politics, but it also comes with benefits. With only two months until Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses, Cruz crisscrossed the central and southern part of the state on a weekend when most candidates took a break from the campaign trail for the Thanksgiving holiday.It’s been a good few weeks for Cruz, who has picked up several coveted endorsements in the state. A recent Quinnipiac University poll of likely Republican caucus-goers shows the junior senator from Texas comes in at 23 percent, overtaking Carson in the second spot and finishing within the margin of error of Trump. According to the poll, Cruz appears to have established an edge among women. The Cruz campaign isn’t taking anything for granted, altering the presidential candidate’s itinerary at the last minute and adding five more campaign stops to an already jam-packed weekend. His rigorous schedule on Saturday included visiting with voters in several local restaurants, holding a town hall at a high school in Lamoni and ending his day with a stop at a Casey’s General Store, where attendees stood shoulder to shoulder just to get a glimpse of the senator at around 10 p.m.“What’s being reflected in the polls is what I’m seeing on the ground,” said Loras Schulte, a former member of the Iowa GOP State Central Committee who recently resigned in order to endorse Cruz.Schulte, from Benton County, attended multiple events this weekend with Cruz, and was particularly impressed to see over a hundred voters packed into a local convenience store for a meet-and-greet with the senator on Sunday night in Van Horne, a town with a population of less than 700. Standing behind the cash register, Cruz did a short version of his stump speech, answered a few questions from the crowd, and then mingled, taking selfies with voters where the snack food aisle was apparent in the background. “This is retail politics at its finest,” Schulte explained. “I’m not sure anyone could have anticipated that big of a turnout, but I think most of these people will undoubtedly come out and caucus for Ted Cruz.” An interesting trend emerged during his campaign stops here over the weekend: A number of voters admitted they had previously supported Donald Trump, some of them even telling the senator directly.“I do think Trump is done, he’s lost my reflection on his ability,” Creston resident Bill Barker said to Cruz after he approached his table at the Windrow Restaurant. Barker continued to rattle off reasons why he had lost interest in the front-running real estate developer. “The fact that he called us Iowans dummies, that was it for me,” Barker said.“He does have a colorful way of saying things,” Cruz responded politely, mindful of reporters following him from table to table with microphones in hand.Cruz has made it clear that he will not engage in the “food fight” he says the media is trying to create between presidential candidates. At a town hall meeting in Coralville on Monday morning, he even dodged a question from a voter asking why he has yet to call out Trump for his inflammatory statements. Cruz defended himself, saying he declines “daily invitations” by reporters to attack Trump, and confidently reiterated his belief that his own campaign will be the last one standing.Cruz's path to the nomination has always been narrow, but in true Cruz fashion, it's one he methodically laid out over the course of his years in Washington, and it's going better than even he could have expected.“Let me be very clear: I don’t believe Donald Trump is gonna be the nominee, I don’t believe he’s going to be our president,” Cruz responded at the Coralville town hall. “And I actually think the men and women in this room have something powerful to say about it. One of the reasons I love the state of Iowa, because in Iowa, y’all take politics seriously.” Elsewhere, he said that commenting on Trump would be acting as a ""theater critic,"" which wasn't his role.Cruz has cast himself as the only “consistent conservative” in a field of “campaign conservatives,” creating distance from Trump and persuading voters who are skeptical of government that his time in Washington has been valuable. He frequently points to his outsider status within his own party.“I’m immensely grateful for Donald Trump because he has framed the central issue of this primary as who will stand up to Washington,” Cruz has said multiple times throughout the trip in response to questions from both voters and reporters.If that’s the central issue, Cruz adds, you have to look at who has stood up to Washington, and “not just to Democrats, but also to leaders in their own party, and there is an enormous difference.""This indirect comparison was enough to sway several Trump supporters in the crowd this weekend, like Marvin Potter, who showed up to Cruz’s meet and greet at a Pizza Ranch in Newton.“We did think about considering Donald Trump because he’s not really a politician,” Potter explained. “After hearing him and hearing Ted Cruz, we went to Ted Cruz. I think Ted Cruz is our man.”Donna Barnard, 38, of Van Horne also found herself in a similar situation. After Cruz’s visit on Sunday evening to the Depot Express in her hometown, she switched her allegiance from Trump to Cruz.“He’s got a record and he’s somebody we can believe in,” the mother of three explained. “He’s somebody that connects well with the people, that’s really important.”Experts acknowledge many Iowans at this point in the cycle are not firm in their commitments, and tend to switch around up until caucus night. “The only thing you can count on is the voter that looks you in the eye and tells you that he’s not going to vote for you,” said Matt Strawn, a former Iowa GOP chairman and Republican strategist. “Just because someone is willing to go out on a date with you this weekend, doesn’t mean they are ready to walk down the aisle in two months.""Cruz's commitment to visiting all of Iowa’s 99 counties -- known as the “Full Grassley,” named after senior Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley -- is proving to be a different strategy than that of his main competitors in the state. This weekend’s trip was his sixth one to Iowa in seven weeks, and a quick glance at his publicized campaign stops shows he had visited nearly half the state's counties by the end of his Iowa swing on Monday evening.“Cruz is running a very different campaign that allows him to have those personal interactions that Carson and Trump and their campaigns don’t seem to be doing as much,” Strawn said. “Their campaigns themselves are, but the candidates aren’t.”At this point, Strawn says he’s unsure which strategy will work, but he’s not willing to write off the traditional Iowa way. “There’s a lot of value in those face-to face-interactions, but we’re not going to know until we wake up February 2,” he said.Speaking with reporters on Monday, Cruz continued to dodge any question criticizing Trump, but did acknowledge that many voters had told him personally that they had shifted from other candidates to his campaign.“You know, we are seeing that across the board,” Cruz said in response to a question from The Huffington Post. “I’m trying very hard to earn the support of every one of Donald Trump’s supporters and every one of Ben Carson’s supporters and every one of Marco Rubio’s supporters and every one of Jeb Bush’s supporters.”With the holidays approaching, Strawn says, it’s nearly impossible to have a clear view of the state of the race. “The race really starts in January, right after we come out of our New Year’s weekend festivities,” he said. As voters filed out of the room following the town hall event in Bettendorf, one man commented on Cruz’s joke about shutting down the IRS and sending all of its agents to guard the U.S.-Mexico border, a joke he’s told for more than a year at public gatherings.“Now that’s something I’ll remember,” one voter said to another. “With so many candidates, I can’t keep them all straight, but with Cruz, I’ll remember.”"
