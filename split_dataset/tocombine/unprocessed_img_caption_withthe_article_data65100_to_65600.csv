0,POLITICS,The Democratic Primary Is About To Get REALLY Messy,Sam Stein and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-democratic-primary_us_56baaac8e4b0c3c5504f642d,This is not the campaign that Hillary Clinton and the party envisioned.,2016-02-10,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"CONCORD, N.H. -- Sen. Bernie Sanders' victory over Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary all but guarantees the party what it wanted to avoid: a long, costly, and potentially damaging primary fight to determine the nominee. Both campaigns on Tuesday night pledged their readiness for the prolonged election. But there was a fresh jubilance in the voices of Sanders' aides, speaking more confidently than before about the prospects that they could end up winning the nomination.""My question to them is: When are you gonna join us? OK!"" Sanders' top strategist Tad Devine said shortly after the senator's victory address in Concord. ""Them"" being Clinton campaign workers.Overconfident as that may sound, the Sanders campaign is now actively gaming out the next major opportunities on the electoral map. A robust advertising blitz is in the works, with the campaign going on the air in Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and the Massachusetts markets, where it hasn’t yet used television advertising. Sanders will meet Wednesday morning with Al Sharpton in Harlem in attempt to shore up one of his chief vulnerabilities: his deficit with minority voters.""We are coming out of here with money and momentum, two commodities pretty valuable in politics,"" said Mark Longabaugh, another top Sanders aide. ""They are going to hit a wall and we are going to continue to be able to re-fund the campaign. It’s one of those things that people are impressed with what we’ve done, but they don’t understand the strategic import of it.""But money can get a candidate only so far, as the once well-stocked Jeb Bush campaign can attest. Though Sanders does indeed leave New Hampshire with a convincing win, the primary schedule doesn't necessarily work in his favor. Clinton has a significant lead in both Nevada and South Carolina, the next two states to vote.In the Clinton campaign, even amid the dour news on Tuesday night, there was confident talk. ""We'll do well in March. And that's where the ballgame is,"" Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta said.Sanders' team insisted the next few weeks aren't as tough as they appear. That's not just because Sanders can ride the momentum of New Hampshire. Devine boasted that the campaign had more staff in Nevada than Clinton, and Longabaugh argued that the caucus elections in March (there are 10 of them) favor Sanders because they tend to draw out a more liberal electorate. It was also noted that Sanders' enjoys a particular luxury: He does not have to change his campaign message, since part of his pitch to voters is that he is almost monomaniacal in his focus on his core issues. ""He doesn’t have to do anything,"" said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the Sanders-backing group Democracy for America. ""He just has to continue to nail it like he has been doing for the last five months.”But there are already subtle signs that the campaign is embracing -- not shifting toward -- new rhetorical notes. During his victory speech on Tuesday night, Sanders made several overt general election appeals, trying to assume the status of general election contender. ""We will need to come together in a few months and unite this party and this nation because the right wing Republicans we oppose must not be allowed to gain the presidency,"" Sanders said. This was by design. As Devine noted, the campaign is attempting to present Sanders not just as an insurrectionist, but as a potential president.""If we are going to win, this it is not just because we win the support of primary voters,"" Devine said. ""It is going to be because we convince the establishment of the Democratic Party that Bernie is the strongest candidate. And so, to do that, we’ve got to show them we can bring people into the process and Hillary Clinton cannot.""For the Clinton campaign, there are multiple questions about what comes next, too. There have already been rumors that the campaign might undergo a shake-up after New Hampshire, with some officials unhappy that there isn't ""a more forward-looking message,"" according to Politico. Clinton herself told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that she didn't know what these reports were about, and Podesta said Tuesday night there was no truth to them.The campaign released a three-page memo shortly after Tuesday's results were announced, touting Clinton's strength in the upcoming states and noting, rightly, that there were far more delegates to gain there than in the first two. ""From a mathematic perspective, it’s clear why March is so important: voters in large states with large delegate allotments will cast their ballots,"" the memo read. ""In total, 1,875 delegates will be awarded in the first 15 days of March, including nearly 900 on Super Tuesday alone. When you take into account the large number of Super Delegate commitments we’ve secured, as well as Hillary’s commanding lead in the polls in delegate-rich states, she is in a very strong position to become the nominee.""That Clinton's team has to rely on sharp analytics and delegate math-crunching to make the case for her winning the nomination is, in and of itself, remarkable. She wasn't supposed to be in this type of protracted struggle, certainly not against someone who wasn't even a Democrat. The former secretary of state's team had no shortage of explanations for how we got to this point. ""We've had eight cycles since John Kennedy ran for president where somebody from next door -- either Maine, Massachusetts or Vermont -- has run in the New Hampshire primary. Eight times. Seven of those eight times, the candidate from next door has won,"" said Terry Shumaker, a New Hampshire lawyer who co-chaired both of Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns in this state. He also chalked Sanders' win up to a ""very liberal part"" of the Democratic Party that was present in the state that may not be such a big factor in upcoming states. ""We came in here thinking that we were going to lose,"" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri added. ""I think that she feels like she got a lot out of this week. Even though the outcome isn't what she wanted, this is a place where she's come and found her voice before.""The next face-off between Clinton and Sanders will be a debate Thursday in Wisconsin. The last debate showed a heightened level of attacks that will no doubt continue as the race gets tighter. And now that Sanders has won a state, Clinton supporters say they want to see him vetted more fully. ""I think for a long time, ya'll didn't take his candidacy that seriously -- felt he was more of an issue candidate instead of a serious contender. ... He needs to be put under the same level of scrutiny that Secretary Clinton's been put under,"" Shumaker said. But if, as Sanders warned in his speech, Clinton and her campaign (or perhaps ""the establishment"") are about to empty the kitchen sink on him, his team is ready. ""If she comes in with the super PAC, she has proven a lot of the point we have tried to make, which is billionaires ought not to be buying elections,"" Longabaugh said. The next few weeks are not going to be the election the Democratic Party envisioned. "

(Reuters) - The federal judge who threw Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis into jail last year for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples said she had not interfered with the process since her release and that licenses with her name removed should still be valid.U.S. District Court Judge David Bunning ruled late on Tuesday that Rowan County's Davis, who spent five days in jail last September for her stand on marriage licenses for gay couples, had not interfered with her deputies' issuing the licenses.When she returned to work, Davis removed her name, title and personal authorization from the licenses.""There was every reason to believe"" the forms she altered would be deemed valid by state officials, Bunning said, adding that the court would continue to monitor Davis and her office.Citing her beliefs as an Apostolic Christian, Davis, 50, drew national attention for her refusal to issue any licenses after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June made gay marriage legal across the nation. Homosexual and heterosexual couples subsequently sued her, and her jailing drew international attention and demonstrations from both sides of the issue.The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the couples suing Davis, had said she made material changes to the marriage forms, which put her out of compliance with Bunning's orders to issue the licenses as part of her job. ACLU lawyers had asked for Davis to be held in contempt and her office to be put in receivership.ACLU lawyer Ria Mar said Bunning's ruling could not be appealed, and it is for a state court to decide the validity of the altered licenses.""The bottom line is that all loving couples in Rowan County can now receive marriage licenses, and we'll continue to fight to ensure that remains the case,"" she said.Davis's lawyers had said she had taken reasonable steps to comply with the judge's orders and should not face further contempt citations.""From the beginning we have said the ACLU is not interested in marriage licenses,"" said Davis' lawyer Mat Staver. ""They want Kim Davis' scalp.”Kentucky's attorney general previously said the altered licenses were valid. In December, newly elected Republican Governor Matt Blevin ordered count clerks' names removed from marriage license forms to honor people's religious beliefs.(Reporting by Steve Bittenbender in Louisville; Writing by Ben Klayman; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)Also on HuffPost:"

But it almost certainly will, because it hears industry-backed cases against the EPA's authority all the time.

After the ruling in the Michigan case, the “EPA boasted in an official blog post that the Court’s decision was effectively a nullity,” a group of 29 states said in their petition asking the Supreme Court to halt the implementation of the new carbon emission rules.Indeed, the EPA chief, Gina McCarthy, seemed confident last year that the agency would achieve its goal to curb toxic gases -- even if it lost at the Supreme Court in the Michigan case.“This is a rule that actually regulates toxic pollution emissions from primarily coal facilities, and we think we’re going to win because we did a great job on it,” she said in an HBO interview with Bill Maher, according to The Hill.“But even if we don’t, it was three years ago.

The Ohio governor holds staunch anti-abortion views.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bba2571800006f0080bb59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has positioned himself as one of the more moderate Republican presidential contenders, plans to sign a bill that strips government funding from Planned Parenthood clinics in his state, his spokesman told HuffPost on Wednesday. The Ohio bill, which state legislators passed Wednesday, prohibits state and certain federal funds from going to facilities that perform and promote ""nontherapeutic abortions."" This exempts abortions performed in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment. Once the bill is signed, about $1.3 million in grants that Planned Parenthood receives from Ohio's Department of Health will be redirected away from the organization. These funds go to programs that help prevent infant mortality and domestic violence, as well as promote HIV testing and screenings for breast and cervical cancer.Joe Andrews, a Kasich spokesman, told HuffPost that the governor plans to sign the bill, but hasn't received it yet. ""Those in Ohio know that Governor Kasich has been a strong advocate for women’s health issues,"" Andrews said, responding to a question about a five-figure ad buy by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio attacking Kasich. Andrews noted the governor has helped 260,000 women gain health care coverage, and has pledged a 3 to 1 state match for a fund for breast and cervical cancer. ""To paint a different picture of his record on prioritizing the health and well-being of women in our state is irresponsible and unfortunate,"" Andrews added. The announcement comes just one day after Kasich secured an unlikely second-place win in Tuesday's New Hampshire Republican presidential primary. Kasich achieved the victory by appealing to the state's moderate GOP voters who might have been disinclined to support reality TV star Donald Trump. The next Republican primary will take place in South Carolina, where voters are more likely to align with Kasich's anti-abortion views.Though supporters of the bill have said funds going to Planned Parenthood programs would be better spent by community health centers, the legislation may have implications for health care providers more broadly. Cleveland.com reported in January that “the Columbus Public Health department said it would be unable to contract with any hospital in the city because they either provide abortion services, contract with abortion clinics or refer patients to abortion services.”The bill is just the latest in a long string of actions targeting abortion access in Ohio since Kasich took office in 2010. Just months after becoming governor, Kasich signed a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy unless the fetus is nonviable. In 2013, Kasich signed a budget that stripped roughly $1.4 million in family planning funds from Planned Parenthood, required abortion providers to perform ultrasounds on patients seeking abortions and allowed rape crisis centers to be stripped of their public funds if they referred victims to abortion providers, among other measures. The budget also blocked public hospitals from entering into transfer agreements for medical emergencies with abortion clinics, threatening clinics with closure if they couldn't get a private hospital to enter into those agreements.

""We don’t have the capacity to fill that void,"" she added. "

Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) stance on reparations is questionable, but he still intends to cast his ballot for him. On Wednesday, in an interview with Democracy Now, the writer, journalist and educator declared his support for the Bern. Coates later clarified that while he would vote for the Vermont senator, he was not endorsing him.Coates has been critical of Sanders’ aversion to reparations -- a topic in which the Atlantic correspondent is very well versed:If not even an avowed socialist can be bothered to grapple with reparations, if the question really is that far beyond the pale, if Bernie Sanders truly believes that victims of the Tulsa pogrom deserved nothing, that the victims of contract lending deserve nothing, that the victims of debt peonage deserve nothing, that that political plunder of black communities entitle them to nothing, if this is the candidate of the radical left -- then expect white supremacy in America to endure well beyond our lifetimes and lifetimes of our children.He has also pushed back on Sanders' tendency to address racism with economic solutions. ""A Democratic candidate who offers class-based remedies to address racist plunder because that is what is imminently doable, because all we have are bandages, is doing the best he can,"" Coates wrote in January. ""A Democratic candidate who claims that such remedies are sufficient, who makes a virtue of bandaging, has forgotten the world that should, and must, be. Effectively he answers the trenchant problem of white supremacy by claiming 'something something socialism, and then a miracle occurs.'""But the mastermind behind ""The Case For Reparations"" and ""The Black Family In The Age Of Mass Incarceration"" has been equally critical of Sanders' rival Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and the role that President Bill Clinton's policies played in spiking mass incarceration. Some black voters may not be aware of the 1994 Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act and how it aided the efficiency of mass incarceration via the “three strikes” implementation, a provision that imposed life sentences on anyone convicted of a violent felony after two or more priors. President Clinton also signed into law the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which gutted welfare. That same year, he repealed the Glass-Steagall Act -- a Depression-era banking law that kept different kinds of banking institutions separate -- which, arguably, led to the 2008 housing crisis and disproportionately affected black homeowners.Sanders, who pushed back against the notion that tougher sentences would drop crime rates, ended up voting in favor of the 1994 crime bill. His decision was based on preserving the Violence Against Women Act, which was packaged into the sweeping legislation.Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow, addressed these issues on Wednesday in an essay for The Nation declaring that Hillary Clinton does not deserve the black vote. Alexander's warning against voting for Clinton and Coates' announcement that he would vote for Sanders come one day after Sanders beat Clinton in the New Hampshire Democratic primary.

Comeback Watch: Jeb Shall Reap The Souls Of His Enemies,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-comeback-watch-new-hampshire_us_56bbaef2e4b08ffac123d2ad,There will be no mercy.,2016-02-10,Jeb Bush has plans to scorch the earth and reap his opponents' souls in South Carolina.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bbb1521a00002d00ab26d9.png?cache=dfmSZ1M6fP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For a few months now, Jeb Bush's campaign has been insisting that the Jeb! Comeback is on and that the media should get in on the ground floor of this amazing narrative. New Hampshire may have given the GOP hopeful just the lift he needs to aid him in his bloodlust. Here's how the comeback is going. Did Jeb Bush improve his fortunes in this week's New Hampshire's primary? Certainly, the numbers don't lie. He finished fourth instead of sixth. He took home a higher share of the vote (11 percent) than polls suggested he was entitled to take (10.2 percent). He quadrupled his number of delegates (now he has four) and more than halved the amount of money he was spending on each vote ($1,200 a vote, down from $2,800). But most importantly, he finished ahead of his hated rival, Marco Rubio.And you know what that means: Now he hungers for the blood of his enemies. And, as Politico's Alex Isenstadt reported Wednesday, the great bloodletting shall begin in South Carolina, where Bush is ""already laying the groundwork for a brutal ... campaign against establishment rivals John Kasich and Marco Rubio.""According to Isenstadt, Bush has laid out his plans to thoroughly harvest the souls of his rivals in a leaked memo that all but announces, ""I am become Death, destroyer of worlds"":“'Governor Kasich has little to no chance in South Carolina, and does not have a national organization that can compete,' the memo says. 'Kasich has consistently supported gutting the military and has no viable path in the Palmetto State.'Bush will also reportedly underscore the young master Rubio's reticence at taking on front-running swamp monster Donald Trump, and accuse him of expecting the nomination process to be his personal ""coronation.""From there, he will sow Rubio's bones into a patch of low country soil to serve as a barren reminder of what happens when fools cross him.Glory shall attend Bush at his blood revels, even as Kasich is made to stand in awe of Bush's fundraising ability. ""We've got to raise more money,"" Kasich said, according to Time's Zeke Miller. If anything, Kasich should flee to avoid getting caught in the violent cleavings that are to come between Bush and Rubio. As Politico's Marc Caputo and Anna Palmer report, what's coming -- one Rubio advisor predicts a ""bloodbath"" --may be too much for the soft-hearted Ohio governor to bear:""Rubio’s campaign estimated that Bush and his allies spent as much as $16 million attacking him in New Hampshire. And they’re bitter about it, though they are already expecting more of the same over the next week in South Carolina. The pro-Bush Right to Rise has $495,000 in ad time in the state booked, according to The Tracking Firm.South Carolina, in short, will be a dark festival of unrelenting carnage. And it could very well be the state where Bush, newly rechristened in battle and possessed of an unquenchable thirst for the viscera of his adversaries, rises up and seizes the nomination that is his birthright. (But probably not.)This has been the Jeb! Comeback Watch for Feb. 9. Jeb Bush finished in sixth place in Iowa (2.8 percent), and fourth in New Hampshire (11 percent). He is currently in fourth place in South Carolina (8.7 percent), and in fifth place nationally (4.6 percent).~~~~~Jason Linkins edits ""Eat The Press"" for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast, ""So, That Happened.""

11,POLITICS,Hero Pediatrician To Congress: Government 'Betrayal' Has Traumatized Flint,Tyler Tynes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-pediatrician-flint-water_us_56bba745e4b0b40245c52df4,“You expect to turn on your tap and you expect that water to be safe.”,2016-02-10,"Politicians and advocates came together at a House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee hearing on the Flint, Michigan, water crisis in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 10, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bba79d1a00002d00ab26b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who helped blow the whistle last year on the toxic water in Flint, Michigan, told members of Congress on Wednesday that the crisis has put fear in the eyes of the city's parents.“We have an entire population potentially exposed to one of the most well known neurotoxins to man. We have a population traumatized,” Hanna-Attisha said.“I was in clinic yesterday and I see a mom, and you see that fear, that trauma in that mom’s eyes,"" she added. ""And that’s trauma for two reasons: it is because of two years of governmental betrayal. You expect to turn on your tap and you expect that water to be safe. And it’s also the fear of the unknown. What is going to happen to my child? What is going to happen because of the lead exposure?”The water quality in Flint deteriorated after state officials failed to properly treat the city’s water supply in 2014, causing corrosion of the city’s lead pipes -- upping the number of children with raised blood-lead levels. Lead exposure can cause a host of health issues, most notably brain damage and behavioral problems in people exposed as young children.Flint has since switched back to it’s original, treated water source, however officials say they're not sure when the water will be safe to drink again.Wednesday's hearing was called by congressional Democrats, who were angry that Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) hadn't been called to testify at a Republican-led House Oversight Committee Hearing last week. Democrats have been hammering Snyder for the Flint water crisis and pushing Republicans to agree to additional spending to fix the city's infrastructure. (Snyder declined to attend the Democrats' hearing on Wednesday.)Tammy Loren, a mother from Flint who attended last week's oversight hearing, said she's afraid that her four children, whose ages range from 10 to 14, have completely changed since being diagnosed with elevated blood-lead levels.“Their grades have dropped drastically, their behavior has changed. They are not the same kids,” Loren told The Huffington Post. “Their personalities have changed behind this. It’s not just in one specific area that’s affected them. It’s affected everything from our day-to-day living to their complete mental state.”Loren said she's not terribly impressed with various actions taken by different levels of government. “Saying you are going to be there and provide these services is not enough because we don’t know how bad it can really get,” Loren said. “That’s the biggest fear. We are afraid of the unknown as parents.”Dozens of Democrats filled the hearing, empathizing with Flint parents. Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.) said that lawmakers need to provide answers for those suffering in the beset industrial town.“I, like other mothers, taught our children to sing the ABC’s while washing their hands so that they could keep their hands under the water long enough,” Edwards said during her hearing’s opening. “I can only think as a mom, with all the other moms and dads, that they asked their children to do the same thing. And their children were exposed to lead and their children were poisoned. We have to do something about that.”Dr. Yanna Lambrinidou, the founder of Parents for Nontoxic Alternatives, said it will be hard for the government to undo the betrayal of the Flint water crisis.“I don’t have advice on how to overcome the fear, because once you’ve been betrayed in this most fundamental way and your child’s future has been sacrificed, I think the fear never goes away,” Lambrinidou said.“We can’t afford anymore to trust our water utilities to protect us from lead and water. There is ample evidence to support that statement,” she continued.Flint Mayor Karen Weaver (D) told Huff Post that she hoped the fears of Flint families will be calmed somewhat by her announcing a $55 million plan to replace the city’s 550-mile network of pipes, which is expected to be completed in June 2017.“We are getting new pipes put in. That’s what’s going to address the fear, really. Our trust has been so broken for such a long time,” Weaver said. “We want to start with high-risk areas where we have people that are pregnant, children under the age of six, people with compromised immune systems and our elderly. We want to get started immediately. It’s already been almost two years. We can’t wait any longer.”She continued: “I hope they’ll trust new pipes and I hope they’ll trust me.” Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the respective Republican and Democratic winners in the nation’s first presidential primary, are very different candidates. Trump is a xenophobic, race-baiting blowhard with vague policy prescriptions and no governing experience, while Sanders is an elected official with a stellar civil rights record and a detailed, if extremely ambitious, legislative agenda. Sanders explicitly critiques unfettered capitalism, arguing for higher taxes on the wealthy and a tax on Wall Street speculation; Trump merely claims that he as a businessman knows how to reorient the economy so that the broader public once again benefits from it.But Trump and Sanders ran on economic populist platforms with some common features that clearly struck a chord with rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats in the Granite State. They both oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and virtually all other trade deals in recent decades (a similarity even Trump acknowledged on Wednesday).In addition, they are both staunchly opposed to cutting Social Security and Medicare, the popular middle-class social insurance programs that are a favorite target of respectable Beltway think tanks.And Trump and Sanders both claimed that it was possible to take the stance they did on those kitchen-table economic concerns because they remain uncorrupted by the campaign contributions of outside interest groups. Trump touted his freedom as a self-funded candidate on victory night, and Sanders again pointed to the “political revolution” enabled by his record number of small donors.Trump and Sanders' shared disdain for establishment orthodoxy was similar enough that some independent voters were apparently torn between the two candidates. “It is clear that the elites have one agenda, most clearly on trade, and the rest of the population has a very different agenda,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research and a critic of recent trade agreements. “This had been evident for a while, the trade deals had always been unpopular, but this vote is pretty overwhelming.”Baker argues that trade agreements would be more popular if they increased foreign competition for American professionals, like doctors and lawyers, as much as they had for people working in manufacturing jobs -- or reduced patent and copyright protections that drive up the price of prescription drugs and other consumer goods, rather than strengthening them. The net result is deals that increase competition for working- and middle-class people, driving down their take-home pay, even as they preserve or boost upper-middle-class incomes, according to Baker.“Apparently the public is no longer willing to put up with policies designed to screw them,” Baker concluded.Michael Lind, an economic policy expert at the New America Foundation who has written extensively about populist movements in the U.S., offered a similar analysis. Only Lind added opposition to mass immigration to the list of issues on which Trump, at the very least, championed the views of the voting public against the will of the elites.“It is not that there ever was support from the mass public or voters on either side for free trade, mass immigration and cuts in entitlements -- there was none in 2005, none in 1995, none in 1985,” Lind said.Lind argued that on all three issues, voters have viewed trade deals, mass immigration and social insurance cuts as threatening their economic interests, whereas Democratic and Republican elites have taken the opposite positions for the same self-interested reasons.“There is a donor class in both parties that have more in common with each other than their parties’ bases,” Lind said. “They are socially liberal, economically conservative” and supportive of immigration policies that they believe would make services and employees cheaper for them.Lind argues that Trump’s deviation from the orthodoxy of his parties’ elites, in particular, can be attributed to his freedom from the demands of this donor class. He notes that the last time a self-funded billionaire sought the presidency, which was Ross Perot in 1992, the candidate ran on a policy platform of anti-trade and anti-immigration populism that is remarkably similar to that of Trump.“The 1 percent gets its way in conflicts with the public 90 percent of the time,” Lind said “The public realizes that with Trump and Sanders this is their only way to register dissent.”The contrast between Trump and his Republican rivals on these matters is clearer of course. Virtually all of the Republican candidates support the TPP trade accord, and those who have weighed in on Social Security and Medicare support trimming benefits for future beneficiaries.Hillary Clinton, Sanders’ opponent in the Democratic race, announced her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership in October, and promised last Friday not to cut Social Security amid rising pressure from progressive activists to take a more definitive position.But Sanders’ opposition to trade agreements has been more consistent over the years; Clinton helped negotiate the TPP and she has appeared to give herself the leeway to support its passage later on under certain conditions. And Sanders is the sponsor of detailed legislation to expand Social Security, while Clinton has yet to embrace a particular plan for shoring up the program’s finances and expanding benefits.“It will be interesting to see if Clinton steps up her criticism of the TPP going forward,” Baker added.Mike Lux, a progressive strategist who worked as a liaison to grass-roots groups in the Bill Clinton administration, said Clinton has scrambled to meet the populist moment, but continues to argue for “incrementalism” in her race with Sanders, which does not serve her with Democratic voters.“That’s why she is having so much trouble,” said Lux, who does not plan to endorse a candidate. “People want big change. They think the system is broken.”The two candidates’ landslide victories are especially notable because support for international trade agreements, “entitlement reforms” that would reduce Social Security and Medicare benefits, and other fiscally conservative positions were once considered so sacrosanct among party leaders and elites that they were dubbed part of a bipartisan “Washington consensus.”“The 'Washington consensus' is dead -- it has been blown apart,” Lux said. But why has the elite consensus imploded so spectacularly right now?Lux said there has been a breakdown in Americans’ confidence in institutions in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the perceived lack of consequences for the financial players most responsible for it. Add to the mix a decline in median household incomes from what they were before the crisis, despite a steady economic recovery, Lux said, and you have the ingredients for the current populist wave in both parties.“People really are fed up,” Lux said. “The anger over what is going on in the country is going to be driving a lot of our politics in the coming years.”Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

The number of abortion providers in Ohio has also plummeted while he's been in office.""Let his dangerous actions in Ohio be a warning to the American people -- we can’t afford this wrongheaded agenda in the White House,"" Laguens added.""To paint a different picture of his record on prioritizing the health and well-being of women in our state is irresponsible and unfortunate,"" he added. In response to the Planned Parenthood ad campaign, Kasich's spokesman said, ""Those in Ohio know that Governor Kasich has been a strong advocate for women’s health issues."" He noted the governor has helped 260,000 women gain health care coverage, and has pledged a 3 to 1 state match for a fund for breast and cervical cancer.This post has been updated with comments from a Kasich spokesman.Also on HuffPost:"

Please help us raise the funds we need, whether it's 10 bucks, 20 bucks, or 50 bucks. Help us raise the money we need to take the fight to Nevada, South Carolina and the states on Super Tuesday.”According to a Sanders aide, the campaign processed 2,689 contributions in a single minute at the high point of the night.Sanders has the largest fundraising base of small donors ever seen in primary elections -- even larger than that of President Barack Obama. By the end of January, his campaign had raised over $95 million from 1.3 million people giving a total of 3.25 million separate contributions.The big post-New Hampshire fundraising bump may, however, require Sanders to change one of the signature lines of his stump speech. When he touts that his campaign is powered by small donors, Sanders always states the size of the average contribution, as he did Tuesday: “And, you know what that average contribution was? $27.”Well, the $5.2 million Sanders raised in the first 18 hours after his speech came with an average donation size of $34.UPDATE:  9:20 p.m. -- By Wednesday night, Sanders had hit $6 million, and his campaign aimed to raise another $1 million by midnight, according to an email to supporters.""In the spirit of this campaign, we're going to reach for a bigger but difficult goal -- raising $7 million by the end of the day today,"" campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in the email. ""I'll be honest -- right now, the math looks difficult to raise another $1 million today. But I think it's important for us to try, and not just because there are 14 primaries and caucuses over the next three weeks.""This post has been updated to reflect the donations received after 21 hours."

Jeffrey Inman, analyzed the shopping habits of some 535,000 people at a major national grocery chain before and after stores began using the Nutritional Value scoring system, or NuVal.That system, established by an independent team of nutrition, public health and medical experts in 2008, assigns each food product a score ranging from 1 to 100, indicating its level of nutrition, and displays that score next to its shelf price.The analysis considered customer purchases in eight categories -- ice cream, frozen pizza, granola bars, spaghetti sauce, yogurt, salad dressing, soup and tomato products. It found that labeling the nutritional value of products resulted in a 20 percent increase in the nutrition content of purchases in those categories.The results didn't surprise Nikolova, given how straightforward the NuVal score is compared with the ubiquitous, and arguably ineffective, nutrition label first mandated in the early 1990s by the U.S. government for all packaged foods sold in stores.“Shoppers usually have limited amount of time when they go grocery shopping, so picking up every product, looking at its Nutrition Facts Panel, comparing it to other products and performing this activity for every product you need takes a lot of time and energy,” Nikolova told HuffPost by email. She said the simplified NuVal shelf label system “makes it very easy for shoppers to find healthier alternatives.”That held true in the analysis, even when prices of those healthier alternatives were higher. The analysis found that shoppers’ price sensitivity decreased by 19 percent while overall sales increased following the introduction of the system.“This is a huge positive change in shoppers' behaviors, that resulted simply from making the nutrition content of each product very easy to understand, see, and compare to that of other products,” Nikolova said.The NuVal system is currently in use in about 2,000 U.S. supermarkets. The system’s nutrition scores weigh more than 30 nutrients -- including vitamins, minerals, sugar, salt and fats -- in addition to calories, quality of macronutrients and how the nutrients influence health.Other voluntary nutritional scoring systems have been introduced with a similar aim, including Guiding Stars and, in Europe, the Traffic Light system.

(There are lots more tweets like this.) Polling from previous elections backs up the idea that a decent chunk of Americans are about to start paying more attention to the presidential race.More people than usual were following this year's election even before the Iowa and New Hampshire contests, according to a January Gallup poll. (Republicans are more tuned in than Democrats, Gallup said.) But the percentage of Americans who say they're following politics tends to increase during the first few caucuses and primaries of a presidential year.In 2008, for example, the percentage of Americans who said they were following the election at least ""fairly closely"" jumped 10 points after the start of the Iowa caucuses. That number continued to rise following the New Hampshire primaries, with 80 percent of respondents saying they were at least somewhat tuned in by the middle of February. Here's the problem: Although some voters start paying attention during and after the first few primaries, less than half of Americans pay ""very close"" attention to a race before the October of an election year, according to polling data.By then, the nominees are selected and much of the organizing and fundraising that helps determine the outcome has already happened.Some Americans are finally waking up to the possibility that a man who wants to ban all members of a religion from entering the U.S. could become president. The real question is how many of them will like that idea. Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

21,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Is Starting To Get Serious About Polls,Janie Velencia and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-poll-spending_us_56b8b9b4e4b01d80b2470e08,Half-a-million-dollars serious.,2016-02-10,Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is making a significant investment in polls. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b8b9fa1f00000d0121787b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) famously eschewed polling in the runup to his bid, instead drawing on his decades of well-known political positioning to put together a platform. It appears he has had a change of heart. The 74-year-old Sanders began as a protest candidate with the goal of elevating issues he cares about, particularly wealth and income inequality. That authenticity seems to have helped attract voters who are tired of poll-tested candidates shifting in the political winds. No surveys are needed to determine that. But with Sanders surging, his campaign appears to be evolving into one that is playing to win: MSNBC reported last week that Sanders spent $500,000 on polling last quarter, up from the $52,000 he spent in the previous quarter. A Huffington Post analysis of Sanders' campaign filings from last year found that he spent at least $500,000, and perhaps as much as $1 million, on polling.There is such a wide potential range because of how candidates file their expenditures with the Federal Election Commission. Sometimes candidates explicitly code their expenses as ""polling"" or ""survey research."" But sometimes they choose to file these expenses under codes like ""strategy consulting,"" or under a combination of codes, that may include some polling services. It's difficult to say exactly how much a candidate spends on polling ""because the FEC doesn't require candidates to report their expenditures in a way that allow viewers to tell what the money is going for,"" explained Viveca Novak, the editorial and communications director at Center for Responsive Politics. Still, spending at least $500,000 is a significant turnaround from the reported $0 Sanders spent in the first two quarters of last year. Sanders senior adviser Tad Devine told HuffPost over the summer that their decision to forgo polling could change as the campaign moved forward if they saw a need to create more targeted advertisements. And it looks like that time has come. Along with an increase in poll spending, Sanders has poured money into advertising in primary states: The campaign spent $10 million in Iowa and $8.1 million in New Hampshire, keeping close pace with rival Hillary Clinton, according to ad-buy data from Morning Consult. This week alone, Sanders has invested over $200,000 on radio buys in South Carolina. Donald Trump similarly renounced the need to rely on internal polling at the start of his campaign -- and he similarly has changed his tune in recent months, spending over $200,000 on survey research, according to FEC records. Sanders' increased poll spending is a sign that his campaign has gained momentum, said Lonna Atkeson, the director of the Center for the Study of Voting, Elections and Democracy at the University of New Mexico. Hiring pollsters and ""building a bigger strategy makes sense when your campaign takes off,"" she said. Internal polling is essential to understanding how to improve a campaign and build a real ground game, Atkeson added. Having a message and relying on free media is not enough for Sanders, who she said must build a broader electorate and persuade voters. Atkeson said she foresees Sanders becoming more reliant on polls as the primary moves forward, as he'll need to figure out how to appeal to minority and undecided voters.Also on HuffPost: "

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who won the Democratic primary by an even greater margin.""I would beat Bernie easily,"" Trump said on ""CBS This Morning"", even though polling data has consistently given Sanders a wide lead over Trump in a hypothetical general-election face-off.Trump's comments are in line with a growing willingness among Republicans to take Sanders seriously. Over the past week or so, GOP candidates have shifted away from their relentless focus on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the inevitable Democratic nominee, and have started attacking Sanders as a potential adversary in November.Trump also claimed Wednesday that he would beat Clinton ""easily"" in November, though polls likewise show Clinton besting Trump in a presidential matchup, albeit by narrower margins than Sanders. Polling data is notoriously unreliable early in presidential contests, but at this point, both Sanders and Clinton have an unmistakable edge over the reality TV star.""The one thing we have in common is trade,"" Trump said. ""The difference between us is, [Sanders] can't do anything about it. I can.""Trump and Sanders are both critics of former President Bill Clinton's North American Free Trade Agreement and President Barack Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership. Sanders, unlike Trump, has consistently argued that such deals have hurt not only American workers, but also workers abroad. Trump's economic message appears premised on a xenophobic fantasy in which fixing trade would magically spark a middle-class renaissance in the United States. It's a sharp contrast with his tax policy, which would inflate the federal debt by 75 percent or more by providing massive tax cuts to the wealthy.Hillary Clinton has publicly repudiated the TPP, but as The Huffington Post has reported, key elements of the American corporate lobbying and executive community do not believe she would actually reject the deal if elected.Liberal critics of NAFTA-style trade deals have argued that such pacts suppress U.S. wages by forcing American workers to compete with laborers in markets with poor environmental protections and weak labor laws. Trump, however, has argued in a nationally televised debate (and elsewhere) that American wages are already ""too high,"" only to deny having done so after facing political blowback. Lying is one of Trump's more common rhetorical techniques.Trump did not explain how he would overturn the U.S. trade deficit, or why Sanders would be unable to do it as well as him. Like his attacks on fellow Republicans, Trump's new assault on Sanders appears to be rooted in the idea that Trump can intimidate foreign powers into submission with the force of his personality alone.Trump also suggested Wednesday that he would assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jon Un, saying he would ""make that guy disappear.""""There are worse things, frankly,"" Trump said.Presidential candidates typically do not threaten to kill foreign leaders on the campaign trail, as doing so can harm existing diplomatic efforts and damage the possibility of future diplomatic solutions.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Zach Carter is a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast ""So, That Happened.""

""There are many things that are major keys to the success of Slack, not least of which are diversity and inclusion,"" Kiné Camara, Slack engineer and former Skype engineer, told the crowd at TechCrunch's awards show, the Crunchies. (TechCrunch's parent company is AOL, which also owns The Huffington Post.)When it comes to hiring people of color, Slack is doing much better than most tech companies -- something Camara took care to highlight on Tuesday.""The idea that diversity helps companies improve culture and the bottom line may be somewhat controversial,"" she said.But, she noted, 9 percent of Slack's engineering team is made up of women of color -- ""four of whom are up in here tonight in formation,"" Camara said, in a reference to Beyonce's latest anthem. ""And we're the fastest-growing enterprise software startup of all time, so...""Camara, and her colleagues Megan Anctil, Erica Baker and Duretti Hirpa, then smiled and shrugged, making their beautiful point wordlessly.Baker, a former Google engineer and an outspoken proponent of diversity in tech, later offered up the inside story on what happened, tweeting as @EricaJoy.Basically, she asked Stewart Butterfield, Slack's chief executive and co-founder, if he was going to the award ceremony. When he said he'd be otherwise occupied (""doing V. IMPORTANT CEO THINGS,"" in Baker's telling), she asked if she could accept an award on the company's behalf. Butterfield said yes.Plenty of tech executives talk about the need for workplace diversity, but Butterfield is rare in that he actually follows through. This is evident in both the company's internal demographics and its honesty about how it can do better.By stepping aside and letting these women speak for Slack on Tuesday, Butterfield made a strong statement about who is important at his fledgling company. He also got people talking about diversity, one of those topics that's never not relevant.""Talking about diversity and inclusion keeps the issue front of mind for ourselves and our people,"" he wrote last week on the company's blog. ""So we are going to keep talking about it."" According to internal data, 43 percent of the managers at Slack are women. Nearly a quarter of its engineering staff are women, and 7 percent are black people. These are relatively impressive numbers for the industry. At Twitter, for example, only 13 percent of the tech staff are women, and black employees account for just 1 percent.Meanwhile, 9 percent of Slack's total 370 employees are black, and 7 percent of its tech staff is black.At Google, a much larger company, just 2 percent of the employees are black.Even more interesting, as Camara noted, 9 percent of Slack's engineering team consists of women of color. That's a statistic that the other tech companies don't even bother reporting.Still, Butterfield acknowledges that the company needs to do better. There aren't any women or people of color on Slack's board. ""When we begin to add outside directors,"" he recently wrote on the company's blog, ""addressing this will be an important priority.""For more discussions on black professionals in the tech space, join AOL BUILD Monday, February 15, 2016 at 6:00pm ET to hear from black tech leaders past, present and future.

Mayor Bill De Blasio joined them for an hour on the 28-degree night.He was the first sitting mayor to join the count, which began in 2003, his staff told a press pool. “You represent something very good and very warm about the city of New York,” he told volunteers at one of the training sites, P.S. 116 in Murray Hill. “Behind our rough exteriors as New Yorkers beat hearts of gold.”This was the last annual count, as future large-scale volunteer counts will be integrated into the city's new HOME-STAT initiative to conduct daily canvasses in order to better monitor the needs of the city's homeless and to provide help.De Blasio has been criticized for his handling of New York's homelessness crisis, with 62 percent disapproval among those surveyed in a recent poll. HOME-STAT is part of his aggressive, $22 million program to combat the issue.

Use of the medication along with counseling, known as medication-assisted treatment, is considered by public health officials to give opioid addicts the best chance at a recovery. But many drug court judges have opposed the treatment, insisting defendants go cold turkey instead.In the U.S., doctors must be certified to prescribe buprenorphine (sold under the brand name Suboxone) and then are allowed to prescribe it to only 30 patients at any one time during their first year. Doctors are limited to 100 patients for subsequent years. The epidemic has led certified doctors to start keeping waiting lists of addicts seeking buprenorphine prescriptions. In more rural communities, as HuffPost recently reported, recovering addicts have to drive hundreds of miles to find a doctor who can write them a prescription.But Huddleston didn’t think the epidemic was reason enough to change the policy -- one that he thought safeguarded against unscrupulous doctors. “I am writing with continued grave concern regarding potential changes to the HHS/SAMHSA buprenorphine guidance that would lift the 100-patient limit for physicians prescribing buprenorphine,” Huddleston wrote. He concluded that the NADCP “is strongly opposed” to changes “that will result in the expanded use of buprenorphine in a manner that is less responsible and presents greater risk to the health and safety of the individuals and communities we both serve.”The same year Huddleston wrote his letter to Burwell, more than 28,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. It’s unclear what influence, if any, his lobbying had on HHS. Burwell replied, thanking him for his concern. He may have gotten a worse response from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). In his letter, Huddleston references writing a similar missive to a top official at that agency and being “disheartened by the response.”Huddleston's lobbying efforts were not successful. This past September, Burwell announced that HHS will be reforming the patient limits in an effort to expand access. Drafts of the new regulations are still being worked on, according to an HHS spokesperson. But Huddleston’s opposition at least highlighted a significant conflict between public health officials and drug court personnel. Last February, following a HuffPost investigation, the White House’s Office of National Drug Control Policy announced that any drug court receiving federal funds could not bar defendants from taking medication-assisted treatment. Dr. Stuart Gitlow, the immediate past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, thinks Huddleston had no business lobbying over health care policy. “For godsakes just let doctors do their job and let us give the appropriate medication and treatment as we do for any other disease,” he said. “Why is a legal system that has no medical skill set, knowledge, capabilities getting involved with something they know nothing about? What would we say if the state Senate said to doctors: You shouldn’t be allowed to prescribe medications to more than 50 hypertensives per month?”Huddleston has left the drug-court nonprofit, but said in an interview this week that he still stands by his letter. He called lifting the caps “a short-term Band-Aid for a very serious problem.""Huddleston’s former employer now says it approves of lifting the patient caps.“The letter you’re referencing no longer reflects our current position on the issue,” said Christopher Deutsch, NADCP's director of communications. “Right now, we’re looking forward to seeing the results of the administration’s review. Obviously, nobody should be denied access to an evidence-based medication when appropriate. Our focus is making sure the drug-court community is educated on the use of MAT and on adopting best practices.” UPDATE: Feb. 18, 10:52 a.m. -- Deutsch later clarified to HuffPost that while the letter doesn't reflect the group's current position, the group has not settled on a new position. ""We do not currently have a position against lifting the caps and, as the quote says, the letter does not reflect our current position. In lieu of an official position we are waiting to see what the administration recommends following a review of the research and consultation with the medical community and other relevant experts,"" said Deutsch.Also on HuffPost:"

The penultimate CNN/WMUR poll noted that plenty of undecided voters are still lurking in the Granite State.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was a ""pussy."" He liked it so much that he repeated to the audience what she said.""You're not allowed to say it, and I never expect to hear it from you ever again. She said that he's a pussy,"" Trump informed the crowd at the Verizon Wireless Arena in downtown Manchester on the eve of the state's primary election. The crowd loudly cheered. Trump then joked, for the sake of the press, that he was reprimanding her. The woman's comment came after Trump said he was surprised Cruz didn't go further in support of waterboarding at Saturday's GOP debate, where Cruz and Trump sparred over whether the technique should be used to interrogate terror suspects. Cruz argued it should be used sparingly, while Trump said he would authorize tactics that are ""a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.""Trump reiterated on Monday that he believes waterboarding should be reinstated, inciting loud roars of approval.Trump also went after another rival, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), saying he was ""sweating like a dog"" amid his gaffe at Saturday's debate.Sitting in Section 223, Tom Jones of Nashua, New Hampshire, cheered wildly as Trump went through his speech. ""America has a cancer and he is chemotherapy,"" Jones said.Jones said he was committed to supporting Trump on Tuesday, arguing that the two political parties had failed the country.That Trump had indirectly called Cruz a ""pussy"" only added to the allure.Many attendees said that they had gone to the rally just to see Trump put on a show. Doug Alderman, of Exeter, said he had been leaning against Trump before the rally. Afterward, he was 95 percent convinced he'd vote against him. ""I think he tried to be too much of an entertainer,"" Alderman said. ""He had the right idea but he wasn't presidential.""Others were hearty believers. Ron Bertolaccini, of Derry, said the bombast wasn't an issue for him. ""I want someone who can get things done the way that I want them to get done -- conservative,"" he said.Trump seemed to have moved on from his second-place finish in the Iowa caucus last week. He said someone told him that if he had attended the Fox News debate before the caucus -- which he skipped because of his dislike for moderator Megyn Kelly -- he could have won. Trump replied that he told that person, ""I did win Iowa.""In reality, Cruz won.UPDATE: 2/9 -- Trump stood by his remarks during an interview Tuesday with MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" calling them a ""great moment.""""I got a standing ovation, the place went wild. Somebody said mixed cheers. Let me tell you, the place went wild,"" he said.

Comeback is on, and that the media should get in on the ground floor of this amazing narrative. Will he do it in tonight's New Hampshire primary or nah? Here's how the comeback is going. Tonight, as results from the New Hampshire primary roll in, Americans will be at the edge of their seats, waiting to see if things will finally start happening for Jeb Bush. Will he rise, like a phoenix, from the Granite State, renewed and bound for the nomination?Franklin Foer says yes indeedy!With his few remaining breaths as a candidate, however, Bush may have a path out from his debacle, an actual shot at the nomination. For months, he tried and failed to crush Sen. Marco Rubio. But he wielded the hatchet like a man who would rather be sailing. What he needed was a wingman. Last night, Gov. Chris Christie, with his bully’s instinct for weakness, baited the golden boy into choking—thereby, relieving Bush of all the throbbing pressure to stage a miraculous New Hampshire comeback.Jeb: the tribune!And the Washington Post's Ed O'Keefe agrees ... somewhat:Something has clicked for Bush in New Hampshire in the past few days. What has transpired by no means guarantees him a top-tier finish in Tuesday’s Republican primary here, but the crowds turning out to see him are bigger, his delivery on the stump is crisper and some of his key rivals have stumbled. At the least, the developments have mostly silenced talk of a hasty exit and skittish donors.Jeb: now 50 percent more adequate!But has that talk actually been silenced? Here's the scoop, according to ABC News' Candace Smith:Many, including some of Bush’s own advisers, believe New Hampshire is his final stand, his last opportunity to prove to the Republican establishment and his powerful donor base that he is a viable candidate who has a shot in future primaries.Jeb: umm ... really, really plausible!Finally, let's check in with former Florida House Speaker and Bush-backer Will Weatherford:""He's the Jeb we all know and love,"" former Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford said here Monday evening. ""He's very loose. And when he's loose, he's on fire.""Jeb: a loose, flammable cream!Anyway, you watch, this will all probably turn out to be good news for John Kasich.This has been the Jeb! Comeback Watch for Feb. 9. Jeb Bush finished in sixth place in Iowa (2.8 percent). He is currently in fifth place in New Hampshire (10.2 percent), fourth place in South Carolina (8.7 percent), and fifth place nationally (4.7 percent).~~~~~Jason Linkins edits ""Eat The Press"" for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast, ""So, That Happened.""
