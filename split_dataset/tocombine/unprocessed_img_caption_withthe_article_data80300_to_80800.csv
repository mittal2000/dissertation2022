But I had no idea the path I would take -- as a result of one simple idea I had -- that would fundamentally change my outlook on life.",2015-08-23,2015-08-23-1440354612-5923769-WhenImgoneitsnotimportantthat.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-08-23-1440354612-5923769-WhenImgoneitsnotimportantthat-thumb.png,"Think you are a giver? If you do, most likely you have it all wrong. I know I did, until recently. Giving has always meant, to me, being able to give a gift or listen to someone by giving my time and energy. But I had no idea the path I would take -- as a result of one simple idea I had -- that would fundamentally change my outlook on life.Late last year, I decided I was going to give something away each day of 2015. I was inspired by all the giving that was taking place from the end of November through the end of the year and I didn't want it to end. There we so many stories that touched my heart, and just about every person and brand had some element of giving happening. I didn't want it to stop. I wanted to live in a world where giving wasn't attached to a time of year. I imagined how I could give something away every day and created a project and called it #365DaysOfGiving. I invited people to be part of it by receiving an email from me each day in which I would offer to give something away. I launched it and waited to see what happened along the way.It has been 223 days since the launch and the lessons I've learned, so far, have been many. Perhaps the biggest lesson is that it isn't about what I am giving away that people respond to but the stories I share as to why I am giving it away. Responses like this come in regularly: This email in particularly resonated with me because I am currently gaining clarity on who I am and recently realized that I had stop waiting for others to choose me, and choose myself. It wasn't until the last 30 days that I've realized we have giving all wrong. Learn to receive in order to give.Early in the year, I had about a dozen people receiving my emails. Even though I was offering something every day, many items went unclaimed. I was crushed. How could I give something away if nobody was receiving what I offered? I started to realize that the act of receiving was as much a part of the process as giving was. To give, someone must receive. The feeling you get from giving feels so good because you know there is another person who receives what you give. In other words, they are actually giving you something by receiving. You both end up being a receiver and a giver regardless of who started the process. In giving, both parties walk away receiving. And many people don't know how to receive. That's what I learned.Taking is not receiving.One of the main reasons people told me they didn't want to receive what I was giving away, was because the felt like they were acting like a taker and not a giver. After reading Adam Grant's book Give and Take, where he classifies people into three groups: givers, takers and matchers, I felt like you were either one or the other, a giver or a taker, not both. But then I had a conversation that made me realize, taking and receiving are two different things. When you take, you gain and someone loses. When you receive, both parties end up gaining something. it's not give and take, it's give and receive. To give is to love.That feeling you receive when you give something is better than getting money. It's difficult to put into words because it's an emotion and not logical or rational. I was at the Gratitude and Trust Summit in NYC this summer and heard one of the speakers talk about the Hebrew word for love, ahavah, which also means to give. This explained it! To give is to love. It's an emotion and feeling that transcends words. Here is to a world of living to give and love in receiving.  Please join me in #365DaysOfGiving by signing up to receive what I give away each day. And if you give something and recognize that you are also receiving, share the experience using the hashtag #365DaysOfGivng. To give is to love. To love is to give."

Raphael founded the nonprofit organization Green Wish. Photo by Brandin Photography.Raphael Sbarge is one of the rare oddities of the world. I'm saying this because his interview answers came over without any errors!Raphael likes to talk a lot, so he's my kind of guy. Hence, I had to split this up into two sections, so be sure to read Part II!You've launched a steam punk inspired comic book called Lantern City? What exactly does ""steam punk"" mean?It's thrilling to be in a comic book. I was a big comic book geek as a kid, starting at around seven years old, until I discovered girls. I still have my comics neatly packed away! Being an actual character in a comic falls into the ""bucket list"" category of life experiences, for sure (right up there with being on Star Trek, but I digress).Steampunk is a style and an aesthetic. The look is a combination of industrial revolution and Victorian times, along with modern technology, and is often referred to as Neo-Victorian. It has a huge worldwide audience and Lantern City will be the newest flag bearer for this very cool genre. #steampunk!You play Kendall Harnick in the comic. Will you be in the Lantern City TV series?The comic has broken sales records for Archaia (a division of BOOM! Comics). There is a published novel, a huge social media following for Lantern City, an RPG game being created as we speak, a fantastic pilot script completed, artwork and designs are ready for the steampunk world that they inhabit. There are some amazing actors and filmmakers who have joined the team. We are in active discussions and should have something to announce soon. But to answer your question, yes, my plan is to be in a Lantern City television series (my schedule permitting). I love the world, and love the stories the creators have developed.You founded Green Wish, a nonprofit that helps local green organizations fund projects for their communities. Why did you feel the need to start Green Wish, what do you do on an everyday basis for Green Wish and what kind of projects does it fund? How did you find people to help you build Green Wish?Green Wish was inspired by the birth of my daughter. I was moved to create something that might help our planet, and address the increasingly important call to action for each of us to do something to try to meet the tremendous need.We read dire headlines on a daily basis and, as a result, can be taken to a dangerous place of apathy (""It's all so bad, why do anything? Why even try?""). I am a firm believer that we need to remain committed every day to actions that make a concerted effort to create change. I passionately believe that we need to be doing everything we can, every day, with our purchases, our commitments and to think of the next generation that will inhabit this place. I also believe that if you give people a way to help, they not only feel better, but that remarkable things can happen.While some organizations pressure you to give money based on fear, Green Wish tries to offer you the opportunity to make a difference right in your community. My feeling is that the other approach encourages people to tune out. If, however, there were not just one, but multiple local organizations that were supported, and you knew exactly WHERE the money was going, and you could see the affect you were having, that creates a resounding sense of good feeling and connects people to wanting to do more. We have created a way for passionate people in cities around the country (and soon to be in Canada) to create chapters of Green Wish that give right back into the community, and help fund important local organizations. It's been incredibly gratifying to watch it grow.You're a videogame voice artist and your credits include the highly acclaimed series Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3 (The New York Times' Game of the Year) and Knights of the Old Republic. How did you get involved in game voice overs? Do you go into a recording studio by yourself and read from a board or do you memorize the lines?I got involved, as one would say, the old-fashioned way: I auditioned. It is incredible to be a part of Mass Effect, as it's not just a video game - it's a movement. Ha! But in all seriousness, I have experienced it firsthand. Mass Effect and Bioware, the company that created it, went above and beyond to create a role-playing game that redefined gaming. They are, from all reports, the gold standard of gaming companies. Mass Effect is played worldwide and the series spanned more than a decade, and has deeply passionate fans who have created a community that is astonishingly large and impassioned. It's remarkable to be a part of this community. As to how we do it: Yes, you stand alone in a recording studio (just you and your imagination, I like to say). We are given the script digitally (used to be paper, but now it's on a screen), and the multiple options are recorded over four hours. At the end of it, you are incredibly tired. It's very intense work -- but then thrilling, once you see what the end result is.What's it like growing up as an only child? What's it like being an adult as an only child? You have two children yourself. Did being an only child influence your decision to have more than one child, or did it just happen that way?I always wanted an older sister, one who would show me the ropes, tell me how things were supposed to go. There were enormous benefits to being an only child, of course (I didn't ever have to share my stuff, and got to hang out with a lot of very cool adults). We had not planned to have two. My son Django (who came second) is one of the true lights of my life. And he has that older sister I had always hoped for. Gracie is 13, and is always more than happy to show him ""the right way to do things."" (Read: ""You're not doing it right, Django! You need to do it like this!""). But, that's his journey. In the end, I know having a sister is hugely beneficial, as they travel through their life together.Please check out Part II of my interview with Raphael Sbarge!"

Raphael also discussed what it was like growing up as an only child. Most importantly, we learned that he still has his comic book collection from when he was a kid! I really have to see what he used to read!You currently reside bi-coastally in Los Angeles and uptown in New York City's Harlem neighborhood. Why Harlem?I found a place in Harlem almost 13 years ago. I did it for several reasons: One, it was where I could afford to buy something at the time (now it would be impossible). I loved the history of this section of the city, the architecture, the vibe. It also reminded me of the Upper West side when I was a kid. It is a very distinct multiracial neighborhood, with lots of families, artists, mixed-race couples--it felt like home to me. I absolutely love living in Harlem. It's the best of New York, as far as I am concerned--kind, helpful neighbors, good people and an intimate neighborhood feel. At the time, everyone thought I was crazy, but I remembered years ago how sections like Soho and Tribeca were once ghost towns, where no one wanted to go. That, of course changed. Since Manhattan is an island (with a finite amount of space), it was obvious to me that Harlem would find its renaissance once again. Indeed, it seems that has been the case.How did you find your first agent? How old were you and what were you thinking at the time in terms of career or just for fun?I decided to be an actor at around 12 years old. I had already been on Sesame Street when I was four, and had done some plays at Yale, where my mother was a teacher at the drama school.I made my decision to be an actor as we were moving back to NYC from New Haven. I called an actress friend of my mother's, and asked, ""What do I do?"" She gave me her agent's phone number, I called them and made an appointment. My mother had made it clear that she didn't want to be a stage mother, so it was up to me, if I wanted to do it. So I bicycled over to the east side to meet them. They asked me who was my representation before, and I said, ""What IS representation?"" They then asked me if I sang, and I said, ""Yes!"" I then broke into the boy treble part of Handel's Messiah (as I had been in a boy's choir that had traveled abroad to perform).They were apparently charmed by this very precocious kid, and despite the fact that they didn't have any child clients, they decided to sign me and be my representation. I got work almost immediately, and then started studying in the city (using my school bus pass to get to auditions, as well as my acting classes). I was a very driven kid, who really knew what he wanted. Now, looking at my kids who are around the same age ... well, it's kind of hard to believe I did this all on my own. But, public transportation and the child labor laws in NYC at the time made it easy for me to work and then bring my contracts home to be signed by my mother. I had my SAG card at 13, my Actor's Equity card by the time I was 15 and did my first Broadway show at 16, with Faye Dunaway. I have worked very consistently since (something I am very grateful about).You've stepped behind the camera serving as director and co-executive producer of two Web series: On Begley Street, starring Ed Begley Jr. (winner of the 2013 Best New Media Award at the Burbank International Film Festival; Platinum Best of Show Aurora award winner, Nature/Environment; nominee, The EMA Awards); and Jenna's Studio, starring Jenna De Angeles, who has racked up more than 3 million views on YouTube. What exactly goes into the making of a Web series? Give us behind the scenes details about what YOU did on the web series.Simply put, after over four decades of working as an actor in front of the camera, I was ready to try my hand behind the camera. It was not something I was aiming for, initially, but ultimately it has been incredibly gratifying.I have just finished A Concrete River: Reviving the Waters of Los Angeles, a documentary about the Los Angeles River. I have more projects as a director in the wings. Initially, I worked with a production company that had the infrastructure to support the venture, but I have since gone out on my own and formed my own company. We are quite busy with new projects.On Begley Street, as well as Is There Hope for the Planet Earth (a documentary short subject about climate change), were a kind of melding of the two parts of me: my environmental passion, with my passion about movies. The possibilities these days, with technology being as available and simple as it is to use, have truly brought us to a moment where everything is possible, and available to everyone to make movies, for pennies on the dollar of what it used to be. I heard someone say, "" If you call yourself a filmmaker, and you have not done something in the past year, then you are not a filmmaker."" The larger issue, then, is finding subjects, stories that make you feel impassioned to tell them. That's more difficult, of course. But the making of media content is available to everyone now.I hate the film Independence Day because it was a rip-off of Ken Johnson's 1983 television mini-series ""V"". How do you deal with people who a) dislike a project you've worked hard on b) dislike YOUR work?I remember doing a production of Ibsen's Ghosts, off Broadway. We had a bumpy rehearsal process (as the director was replaced, midway). We were finally able to find our way so we could open, and it went quite well. At the time, there was a big push to bring NYC school kids to see live theater. This was a wonderful program, but this play, which is dated at best, and downright melodrama, was maybe not the best play for NYC high school students to see. It was especially not the play for them to see at the matinee that the New York Times' theater critic was attending. There is a place, deep in the second act of the show, where Oswald (my character) starts to have an emotional death scene on stage. It's, as I said, high melodrama but the school kids literally went wild. They started laughing and cat calling, and it was, well, an awkward moment, at best. The next day, the New York Times critic wrote, ""Raphael Sbarge, in his portrayal of the tortured Oswald, drew gales of laughter from the audience..."" That was almost 30 years ago, and I still remember it today.  What was the first Broadway play you saw?I literally grew up back stage. My mother was a Broadway costume designer. I remember seeing shows, going back to when I was five years old. I have been to all of her Broadway openings (maybe 15-20), and loved playing back stage with the actors, using the costumes to dress up in (she had a play that opened and closed on its opening night, and I got to play with all the costumes at home. It was a blast!). I used to make capes and use the cardboard inside the fabric looms to make swords. I started ""aging costumes"" (which means throwing mud and dirt around) at seven. I worked in the scene shops at Yale and elsewhere, cleaning up, and helping move set pieces. The actors were like magic, larger-than-life friends who were so kind and sweet to me. They were my extended family. So when someone says, they ""grew up in a trunk,"" I can say, quite honestly, ""Me, too!""Be sure to check out Part I of my interview with TNT's Murder in the First actor Raphael Sbarge!"

Fogle pleaded guilty this week to both charges.“When we first heard about an alleged complaint being made to the company about Jared Fogle, we immediately investigated and found no record that this was ever brought to our attention,” a Subway spokeswoman told The Huffington Post in an email. “When we heard about the possibility of a second complainant, we began an investigation that is ongoing.”Florida journalist Rochelle Herman-Walrond told Gawker on Friday that she tipped off the FBI after Fogle made sexual comments about her two young children. CNN reported the U.S. Attorney's Office in Indianapolis, where Fogle was based, said Herman's information was part of the federal investigation. Walrond also told Gawker she complained about Fogle to Subway through the company's website, but never got a response.Last month, Business Insider reported that Fogle solicited sex with minors, and texted a friend to boast about a sexual encounter with a 16-year-old escort.Fogle, 37, pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and multiple counts of sex with a minor earlier this week.Subway distanced itself from Fogle after the head of his charitable foundation was arrested on child pornography charges. The company this week fired Fogle in anticipation of his guilty plea. Sales at the Subway, which is privately held, fell 3 percent in the U.S. last year."

Police said when they ordered the men to lower their weapons, Ball-Bey raised his gun.The circuit attorney’s announcement follows the release of details from Ball-Bey’s autopsy report, which concluded his fatal wound was caused by one bullet that entered through his back and pierced his heart. According to police, a total of four shots were fired -- one officer fired three times, the other once.St. Louis Post-Dispatch initially reported that police investigators claimed to have found fingerprints and DNA on the gun Ball-Bey allegedly pointed, but later . St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told the Post-Dispatch that ""just because he was shot in the back doesn't mean he was running away.""During the press conference, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce urged the city to remain peaceful during this time, and reiterated the her job duties.“I don’t work for the police chief. I don’t work for the mayor. We work with the police every day but we also prosecute them,” she said.The investigation of Ball-Bey’s death will be conducted independently from that of the St. Louis Police Department. Witnesses will be interviewed separately. When asked if the interviews would be shared with the police, Joyce said she does not know of the protocol, but would be willing to cooperate with police.St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay recently picked seven people to be part of the St. Louis civilian oversight board. The board is expected to review and investigate complaints of police misconduct in St. Louis city.Joyce has been at the center of multiple protests, including one that took place at her home. The demonstrations followed Joyce’s decision to not prosecute the officer who fatally shot 18-year-old VonDerrit Myers last October. Joyce says she welcomes the community to meet with her, but also said during the meeting that she has had a difficult time getting the activist community to cooperate with her, noting that it took months to get a key eyewitness in Kajieme Powell’s case to talk to her because “protesters told him not to.” Joyce's office is still investigating the case of Powell, who was fatally shot by St. Louis Police last August.“We are completely separate from the police department. We are completely different,” Joyce told media.“We all want the same thing, so let’s work together on this.”Standing by Joyce’s side at the press conference was Adolphus Pruitt, president of the St. Louis chapter of the NAACP.“It’s extremely important we have a second set of eyes and it’s important that we get it right,” said Pruitt. “We got to get it right this time in St. Louis.”Pruitt went on to advocate for police body cameras and to support the dual investigation, adding that at some point, the community will need to ""rebuild trust.""Joyce did not estimate how long the investigation would last, but said it needed to be done quickly. ""There are a lot of people in this community concerned about this case,” she said. UPDATE:  Aug. 25 -- An earlier version of this story included the St. Louis Post-Dispatch's assertion that police investigators claimed to have found fingerprints and DNA on the gun Ball-Bey allegedly pointed. The newspaper later deleted this information without clarification."

In nine key Senate races, outside groups have already spent at least $12.5 million on advertising and grassroots communications targeting both already announced and potential candidates.  Nonprofit groups that are not required to disclose their donors are responsible for $11.2 million of that spending. These totals are reached through a combination of Federal Election Commission and Federal Communication Commission records, press releases and advertising buy data provided by a Democratic source.The amount spent this year significantly exceeds that spent at this point in the 2014 election cycle. The total spent by outside groups continues a trend that has set in since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision unleashed a rising tide of outside spending in elections. Leading the way in 2016 Senate battleground spending are a small number of groups aligned with the Republican Party. Americans for Prosperity and Concerned Veterans for America, both affiliated with the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, combined to spend at least $4.3 million. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest corporate lobby, has spent $2.3 million to boost Republican candidates. One Nation, a nonprofit recently taken over by the strategists running the Crossroads groups founded in 2010 by Karl Rove, has spent $1.9 million.GOP Groups Dominate Early Spending In Key 2016 Senate RacesSource: FEC and FCC records, press releases and advertising buy data provided by a Democratic source.A large portion of the advertising and advocacy done by these groups, none of which disclose their donors, comes in the form of issue advocacy. This means that the advertisements stop short of calling for the election or defeat of a particular candidate and instead implore viewers or listeners to call them and either praise or denounce a particular stand they have taken on a given issue.A controversial Internal Revenue Service policy allows nonprofits to spend up to 49 percent of their budget on express political advocacy so long as they spend the other 51 percent on the stated purpose they provide to the IRS to gain tax exemption. A small but significant number of groups often spend large sums on issue advocacy directed at candidates they will later target with express support or opposition.Those already filling the airwaves in battleground Senate races include Concerned Veterans for America. The Koch-funded veterans' group has spent $1.5 million on an advertising campaign in Pennsylvania touting Sen. Pat Toomey’s (R-Penn.) support for legislation -- enacted in 2014 -- to fix healthcare and bureaucratic problems at the Veterans Affairs Administration.In New Hampshire, Americans for Prosperity is running a $1.2 million advertising campaign hitting Gov. Maggie Hassan, a potential Democratic Senate candidate, over her budget proposal and rejection of the budget backed by the Republican-controlled state legislature. The anti-Hassan push goes beyond television, radio and digital advertising as the group’s New Hampshire affiliate has volunteers knocking on doors and distributing literature assailing Hassan’s positions. If she decided to run Hassan would be challenging Sen. Kelly Ayotte.The Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity also went on the air in Ohio with a $1.5 million ad buy attacking Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland for job losses that occurred when he was governor from 2007 through 2011, the peak of the financial crisis and recession. Unlike the ads running in New Hampshire, the anti-Strickland campaign is not issue-based and expressly opposes the former governor. Strickland is running to unseat first-term Sen. Rob Portman (R). These campaigns from Americans for Prosperity come at a much earlier date than the onslaught of ads the group poured on key Senate races in the fall and winter of 2013, attacking candidates over the disastrous rollout of Healthcare.gov.Like Americans for Prosperity’s advertising in Ohio, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is running express political ads supporting Republican candidates. The business lobby is up with ad buys in Arizona, Illinois, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Since an insurgent class of tea party Republicans has emerged to target establishment Republicans in primaries, the Chamber has stepped in to fight back. Its ad buy in Arizona supporting Sen. John McCain (R) stands out as a possible attempt to beat back any potential primary challenge the former presidential candidate may face as tea party groups look for a target in 2016. The business lobby ran similar ads to scare off challengers in West Virginia in the 2014 cycle.The print, digital and radio campaign run by One Nation, meanwhile, lends support to some of the most endangered Republican senators including Ayotte, Portman, Toomey, Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.). The ads are all issue advocacy touting the senators' support for legislation to reform Medicare and Medicaid payments to doctors, which passed into law during the current session of Congress.One Nation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are the only groups spending six figures to support Kirk’s reelection campaign in Illinois. Kirk, elected in the 2010 wave election that brought large Republican gains, represents the most Democratic state of all Republican senators. His vulnerable status is underscored by the fact that he is the only Republican who has received more negative ads from Democratic-leaning groups than support from those aligned with Republicans.Environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Mom’s Clean Air Force, Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters have all run negative issue advertisements hitting Kirk for voting to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon emissions. The majority of the anti-Kirk advertisements have come from the NRDC and Mom’s Clean Air Force, who joined together for a $1 million campaign.The two groups are also spending $500,000 targeting Portman in Ohio while the Sierra Club is in the midst of a six-figure satellite television advertising campaign.Portman is one of two Republican senators receiving support from his own super PAC. Fighting for Ohio, a super PAC run by former aides to the senator, has raised $185,000 and spent $14,000 to boost Portman’s reelection. The largest donor to the group is hedge fund executive Thomas McInerney, who gave $100,000.Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is also boosted by a personal super PAC called Restoration PAC. The group has already spent $500,000 on ads praising Johnson for opposing the nuclear inspection deal negotiated between Iran, the United States and other world powers. Restoration PAC’s ads, however, had to be edited after they included a fake picture of President Barack Obama shaking hands with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. Richard Uihlein, the head of shipping company Uline, contributed $300,000 to fund the group.In 2014, the Senate races in North Carolina and Colorado topped the $100 million mark in total costs for the first time ever, thanks to the increased role of outside groups. The early start to outside spending in the 2016 races likely means that the number of $100 million Senate races will grow quickly."

""We intended to carry it out,"" Barak said, but going ahead with an attack on Iran while U.S. forces were conducting the exercise would have been bad timing.""You're asking and demanding America to respect your sovereignty when making a decision to do it even if America objects and it's against her interests, you can't go in the opposite direction and force America in when they're here on a drill that was known ahead of time,"" Barak said.Netanyahu's spokesman could not be reached for comment.Like Israel, the United States, had said military action was an option if diplomatic efforts failed to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons. The Obama administration says a deal agreed with Tehran in July will prevent Iran getting the bomb.That agreement is opposed by Israel, which believes it will be ineffective and allow Tehran to exert greater international influence.Also on HuffPost:"

There are sentences you don't expect you'll ever have to write, and that was one them. Alas, Jenner shared a photo of herself in bed with the Internet's official BFF early Saturday morning.After getting over the initial confusion of this particular pairing (Hey, we didn't know Lawrence was friends with Amy Schumer until she showed up in the comedian's vacation pics), the greater question of what brought them together to take such a photo was still unanswered. Well, we learned a lot from Jenner's caption. Not only were they celebrating the actress' 25th birthday, the two seem to be pretty close friends -- unless it's cool to wish casual acquaintances ""Happy Birthday you piece of shit."" Maybe it's a Hollywood thing, but it seems doubtful.While the fact Jenner and Lawrence appear to be so close is surprising, the friendship itself isn't shocking if you've been paying attention. Lawrence is a long-time, self-professed Kardashian and reality TV fan. She's dropped the Kardashian name in multiple interviews over the years, letting it be known that she loves the family and the show -- unlike some other A-listers who shall remain nameless (Actually, we'll name them: Jon Hamm, Jonah Hill, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Daniel Craig) and really need to chill. And in January, Kim Kardashian recalled bumping into the Oscar-winner actress, who promptly freaked out.""I was in NYC and I ran into Jennifer Lawrence,"" Kardashian told the U.K. newspaper The Sun. ""We said, 'Hi' and walked into the elevator and as the doors were closing. She screamed across the lobby, 'I love your show!' We were laughing so hard."" Also on HuffPost: "

Today, we speak with Demetrios Papademetriou about Europe's migrant crisis.Hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and searching for a better life have crossed into Europe this year, often by perilous means. This ever-increasing influx of migrants from nations such as Syria, Eritrea and Iraq has left European countries struggling to cope with a growing humanitarian disaster. Scenes of thousands of migrants held in sports stadiums or makeshift encampments, sometimes lacking food or water, show how dire and inadequate current conditions are for people arriving in Europe.The crisis has also left states both domestically and internationally divided over how to respond to this rise in migration. Asylum applications are extremely unevenly distributed among EU nations, and some political parties' framing of migrants as a security concern and economic issue has renewed nationalist tensions.As the number of migrants entering Europe soars, aid agencies and prominent EU leaders have called for a unified policy to address migration. But such attempts have so far resulted in dead ends, and with more people arriving on Mediterranean shores each day, the pressure is on to find a solution.To better understand what action Europe needs to take to sufficiently address the crisis, The WorldPost talked with migration expert Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute Europe.What should a European migration policy look like? This is a complex crisis. There are humanitarian elements, a border protection crisis, an integration crisis and a financial crisis. If you do nothing to address each of them, each wave of migration will be bigger than the last. Any nation has an obligation to rescue people. That is a given, it is not a policy. Europe will have to invest in creating real opportunities for refugees, in particular from Syria, so that they can stay in neighboring countries. We have to create opportunities for refugees to make a livelihood, get an education, and access health services. We also have to create opportunities for the local populations in these countries who have been affected on a day-to-day basis by the massive number of refugees. Otherwise, more Syrians are going to come to Europe out of sheer desperation.Europe should also try to work with countries that are a launching pad. Afghans, for example, have to pass through a lot of countries to get to Europe. We could target three or four key countries on the pathway and do as much as it takes to get their cooperation -- to stop traffickers, to create opportunities for people to stay, and create a safe pathway.It's very difficult to solve the Syrian problem. So, let's make sure there's not another Syria. We need to invest political resources and financial incentives to make sure that the next country that might have a problem doesn't become so bad that people have to flee for their lives. By the time the exodus takes place, you've already lost the game. This has already happened in Yemen. I'm very concerned about Egypt. A foreign policy that tries to just put out fires is not a foreign policy, it's a reaction.What about people who have already made it to Europe?There are three ""baskets"" of people: those judged to be refugees, who have a real fear of persecution; those who receive ""subsidiary protection,"" who come from countries with authoritarian regimes but are not themselves specifically targeted; and illegal immigrants. We have to protect refugees, make sure subsidiary protection is not open-ended, and return illegal immigrants and do it quickly. Europe needs to send a message to the next wave of immigrants, as well as to assure the public that someone is ""minding the store."" In order to protect refugees, you need to make sure that those who are not refugees are sent back. It's the people who receive ""subsidiary protection"" who are the most difficult category. They're not refugees, but they come from countries that are not particularly safe. For example, Eritreans are fleeing a pretty nasty regime and forced conscription. Does that mean every Eritrean who makes it to Europe should get full protection?What does the future hold for migrants integrating into Europe?The effects of the latest wave of migration are going to be felt for the next five to 10 years. Despite what people in the U.S. think, Europe has made enormous progress integrating migrants, especially in Germany. This has happened through investing in integration -- language and civics classes, for example, and integrating people into the labor force. It's possible to do this when you have 30,000 people arriving, but what do you do about 1 million people, as looks possible in Germany? Meanwhile, Greece is completely broke. Macedonia has closed the border and an awful lot of people may end up being stuck in Greece. How will the people of Greece react? There have been a lot of very nasty reactions to immigrants in Greece in the last few years.Unless we have a strategic response to this crisis, a lot of countries are going to be overwhelmed.What needs to happen for Europe to adopt a more strategic migration policy?If a few of the more powerful and wealthy countries in the European Union get together and decide to push Brussels, it could happen. Each one has a comet tail of other countries that would support them.Is there political will to do that?The simple fact is that if [European leaders] don't take control, they will lose their jobs. Governments will fall if the reaction gets even more hostile. People always say it's just extremists and racists and try to sideline the issue. But if this hostility becomes mainstream, some of the politicians' rhetoric and policies will have to move further to the right, and then it's too late.What do you expect Europe to do next?They seem to be moving in the direction of a greater police response. The U.K. and France forged an agreement over [the migrant crisis in] Calais on Thursday that focused on police enforcement. It's likely that the next set of initiatives will fall more on security rather than a complex set of integrated activities.However, Germany's development minister recently called for 10 billion euros to support Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan -- countries that are hosting nearly 4 million Syrian refugees. This suggests that Europe could be beginning to think more strategically.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Also on HuffPost:"

The congregation is arguably the first American synagogue to self identify as non-Zionist in its mission statement.Rosen, who served as rabbi of the mainstream Jewish Reconstructionist Congregation in Evanston, thought he’d retired from pulpit work. But people sought him out to discuss creating a new congregation.“There are increasing numbers of Jews out there, particularly young Jews, who don’t identify as Zionist and resent the implication that somehow to be Jewish today one must be Zionist,” said Rosen, who previously co-founded the Jewish Voice for Peace Rabbinical Council. Jewish Voice for Peace is an American Jewish organization opposed to Israeli military presence in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.“We are really a community for Jews who don’t reduce their Judaism to narrow political nationalism. As far as I know there aren’t any other congregations out there who describe themselves in those terms.”So far, the congregation has approximately 85 members, from millennials to older adults, Rosen said.For some, such as steering committee member Mark Miller, the synagogue is a welcome development.“For those of us who are progressives and really have problems with the human rights abuses and other problems we see in modern-day Israel, this is a way for us to take a step away from that and have a congregation that is not aligned,” Miller said.Rosen has experienced a swell of support but also some pushback from the wider Jewish community.“I think you cannot cut off Israel from Judaism,” said Rabbi Josh Weinberg, president of the Association of Reform Zionists of America. Weinberg grew up in Chicago and taught in a high school program with Rosen in 2002. “The word ‘Judaism’ was the religious affiliation of the people who lived in the land of Judea. All of our Jewish expression, Jewish identity, everything we say in our prayer books is all geared towards Israel, our nationalist existence in a particular geographic location.”For Weinberg, the state of Israel is a central component of Jewish identity and connects American Jews to a sense of peoplehood.“Does that mean that, just because we have a spiritual and a covenental relationship with the state of Israel, that we always have to agree with everything the state of Israel does politically? No, far from it,” he said. “But I want (improving Israel) to be a project all Jews around the world participate in. And to hear about a synagogue that’s trying to cut off those ties because of politics or policies is sad to me.”But is Tzedek Chicago an outlier on the fringe of mainstream American Judaism or the first manifestation of a growing trend?Theodore Sasson, senior research scientist at Brandeis University’s Center for Modern Jewish Studies, noted that Jewish non-Zionism isn’t new. Ultra-Orthodox sects such as Satmar or Neturei Karta have long been ideologically opposed to the state of Israel, based on their belief that a Jewish nation-state should only exist when the messiah comes.Similarly, many liberal Jews were non-nationalist before Israel’s founding in 1948. After that, the majority of Jews identified as pro-Israel, Sasson said.So, if Tzedek Chicago represents a change, it’s not the emergence of Jewish non-Zionism in America but the growth of liberal Jewish non-Zionism. But even that, according to Sasson, is not the main trend Tzedek Chicago symbolizes.Rather, the synagogue is one example of the plurality and diversity of U.S. Jewish voices, particularly in relation to Israel, said Sasson.He stressed that despite the widening spectrum of Jewish public opinion, the majority of Jews hold various political positions within a pro-Israel framework. According to the most recent Pew Research Center study on American Jews, in 2013, 7 out of 10 Jewish Americans feel some level of attachment to Israel, which has remained consistent since 2000.“There is not a flight from Israel among American Jews,” said Sasson. “My impression is that Israel continues to serve as a focal point for Jewish identity in the United States, even if increasingly that means that Israel serves as something to argue about.”Zionist Organization of America President Morton Klein dismissed the emergence of one non-Zionist synagogue as significant.Statistically, he said, “they don’t exist.”While Rosen would likely beg to differ and expects to see more congregations like Tzedek Chicago pop up, he’s unconcerned with the niche quality of the new synagogue. “We don’t expect to be for everyone,” he said.Rosen is concerned that Tzedek Chicago will be pigeonholed as “the non-Zionist synagogue,” when that issue is only a fraction of what the synagogue hopes to stand for, he said.“We espouse the vision that’s deep within Jewish tradition that stands for freeing and standing with the oppressed and standing up against the oppressor,” said Rosen. “We founded the congregation because we wanted to espouse what many of us believe are some of the central, most sacred values of Jewish tradition.”"

But as the objects that surround Sagittarius A* in the Milky Way's center are pulled in by the black hole's strong gravitational grasp, the interaction emits light at various wavelengths, including x-rays.(Story continues below.)After analyzing the image, an international team of astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics has not only concluded that the center of the galaxy is a dramatic place, but that Sagittarius A* may be partly to blame for the tumult. The black hole is so ginormous that it has a mass a few million times that of our sun.

You know who has had it worse than Josh? His wife, Anna.",2015-08-22,Lonely woman sitting with couple in park on a sunny day,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6071c2400005100981ce1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"These past few days the internet has been abuzz with the news that ""19 Kids and Counting"" star Josh Duggar was included among the 32 million individuals who were exposed in the now infamous Ashley Madison hack and data dump. The general consensus seems to be that Josh Duggar (and maybe his family?) has finally had karma catch up to him and that it is actually a ""good"" thing that this happened so that the Duggar family can be exposed. While I will admit to understanding the irony of someone who espouses the importance of ""family values"" so boisterously being caught in a scandal such as this, I cannot bring myself to express any sort of glee over this news. This past week, 32 million families have been forced to deal with the painful consequences of infidelity. There are a lot of broken hearts this week. My heart breaks with them. But the story is the Duggars, and boy, has Josh Duggar had a rough few months. To say that Josh Duggar has had a bad year is perhaps an understated assessment, but to talk solely about Josh is to undermine and trivialize the real victims of Mr. Duggar's choices. You know who has had it worse than Josh? His wife, Anna. Let's put ourselves in her position for just a moment. Not four full months after her husband admitted to molesting underage girls (including his own sisters) it has now come to pass that Josh paid almost $1,000 to Ashley Madison so that he could cheat on the woman that for some reason has stuck with him through all of this. I cannot even imagine the thoughts, emotions, and questions that have been swirling through Anna Duggar's heart over what has to have been the most gut wrenching and soul crushing time of her life. Well, actually that's not completely true. Today, the New York Daily News published an article with the headline, ""Anna Duggar will 'absorb blame' for cheating hubby: report"" In the article, Mrs. Duggar is reportedly sensing that, ""there will be some suggestion of whether or not she should have been more aware of the pressures Josh was under, of the issues he was facing, and how she could have better counseled him or helped him..."" Of course, it is not completely clear if Anna is speaking these words for herself or if they are being spoken on her behalf by her family. However, one thing is abundantly clear: Anna Duggar is going to take the blame for her cheating, child-molesting husband. It is for this reason that my soul completely breaks for Anna Duggar. But it's not just Anna Duggar, is it? This is not just an isolated incident, is it? And this is where this story moves out of the tabloids and into schools, businesses, churches, and homes across the country. How many women, for one reason or another, privately or publicly assume some sense of guilt and blame for their significant other's transgressions? How many women, when confronted with the news that their boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse has intentionally been unfaithful will think to themselves about the ""pressures"" that they have been under or that she could have ""counseled"" or ""supported"" them better? How many women have been taught to believe that it is their fault that this betrayal has occurred? Happens all the time, doesn't it? This is Rape Culture personified. Women are made to feel inferior and that it is their job to keep their spouse happy so that they do not stray into ""inevitable"" temptation. This is a message that we are still conveying to women and girls on a daily basis. This is what they learn when they are told to cover up their collarbone or they sweep under the rug the vindictiveness they receive when they turn down a man's sexual advances. This is real, and it's happening every single day. And it HAS. TO. STOP. If this sort of victim blaming and continued male domination is going to stop there are two things that must be understood: Girls, It is not your fault if your significant other chooses to be an Ass-Hat. Please, please, please hear this, understand this, internalize this, and know this. It is not your fault. It is not your fault that they couldn't be honest with you and faithful to you. If he cheats, that means he did it, not you. You did not drive him to Ashley Madison, the strip club, the corner bar, or back to an ex-girlfriend. He did those things, not you. If you ever (God-forbid) find yourself in a position where you are being blamed for such things, you need to own who and what you are, muster up (even in the midst of pain and heart-break) every ounce of dignity and self-worth you can manage and tell him to get the #*$(% out. Don't you even think about rationalizing the behavior or compromising who you are. You deserve better and anyone who will not give you their very best is not worth your time, energy, or life. Guys, you don't ever (EVER) allow someone who loves you to take the blame for your selfishness.If we can't focus at school because a woman's collarbone is showing, that is not her fault, it is ours. If we get turned down for a date (or whatever) it is not a license to victimize the woman who just rejected us. If we are so insecure by the women in our workplaces that we have to demand that they behave (or dress) in a certain manner then that is our shortcoming and not one that they should have to adhere to. If we, for whatever reason, choose to stray away from the one who has chosen to love us, then THIS IS OUR FAULT and NOT HERS. And guys, here's the deal. It is our responsibility and burden to end Rape Culture and the practice of blaming the victim. This is something that we need to hear, understand, internalize, and know. The story of Josh Duggar and Ashley Madison will soon fade into the noisy background that is the internet and the 24-hour news cycle, but for women (and men) across the country, this struggle will still remain very real. And that is why this story matters."

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb90de02600002d0183cb24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Julian Bond died last week, every major news outlet featured tributes praising his more than five decades of leadership in the struggle for civil rights. He was all the things that were said about him. He was courageous and visionary, a steady hand and a thoughtful strategist, and a tireless and eloquent voice for justice for all who were denied their rights.But for me, Julian was more. He was a mentor who more than four decades ago taught me a lesson that has guided my work ever since. I have told the story before of my first meeting with Julian Bond back in 1973. But because I believe it remains so very relevant, I want to share Julian's lesson one more time. The story begins at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, IL. In the months preceding the Convention, the country had been shaken by a series of traumatic developments. Martin Luther King, Jr. had been assassinated in April. Three popular anti-war Senators (Eugene McCarthy, Robert Kennedy, and George McGovern) were running strong campaigns against then-President Lyndon Johnson--opposing his Vietnam War policy. Their combined successes ultimately forced Johnson to announce that he would withdraw from the contest. And then, in early June, Kennedy was assassinated.When Democrats gathered in Chicago, in August, they were still reeling from the shock of these events. The Convention itself was a tumultuous affair that brought together all of the conflicting currents of the period. Outside of the Convention, there were massive demonstrations against the war in Vietnam coupled with substantial gatherings of ""counter-culture"" activists. At one point, the demonstrations were confronted by a shameful display of police/military force. A battle ensued. There were tanks in the streets, beatings and tear-gassing of protesters who chanted ""the whole world is watching"" because what was playing out in the streets of Chicago was reminiscent of scenes of uprising and repression that had occurred behind ""the Iron Curtain"". These same currents played out inside the Convention. As the proceedings began, there was a battle over which delegation should receive credentials to represent the state of Georgia--an all white group, or a mixed-race delegation that included Julian Bond. There was some drama, but in the end, the integrated slate won the right to be seated.Then came a platform fight over a plank to oppose the war in Vietnam. It became as heated as the demonstrations on the outside. The anti-war plank was defeated, but in a last ditch effort to continue their protest, party progressives decided to contest the party regulars' handpicked choice for Vice-President, Senator Ed Muskie. They put Julian Bond's name in nomination as their candidate to run on the ticket with the party's Presidential nominee, Hubert Humphrey. Humphrey, who, as a Senator had a sterling record in civil rights and labor rights, had served as Johnson's Vice-President and was, therefore, viewed with suspicion by anti-war Democrats. The party regulars who supported Muskie were too strong and won the day. Outraged by the way their concerns had been ignored by the party leadership and by the use of brute force against the demonstrators, the anti-war delegates had their say in demonstrations on the floor of the Convention--chanting the name of their candidate ""Julian Bond"". In a crude attempt to regain control of the proceedings, the convention's leadership brought in police who used unconscionable force to bring order. On the final day of the Convention after Humphrey and Muskie had delivered their acceptance speeches and stood center-stage amidst the balloons and confetti and cheers from the party regulars, a remarkable thing occurred. Onto the stage walked Julian Bond. He went over to Humphrey and Muskie and joined hands. Like many young activists, at the time, the scene left me bewildered and devastated.A few years later, I met Julian Bond. He had come to lecture at a college where I was teaching. I asked him why he walked out onto the stage that night and told him how let down I had felt. In response, he told me that there were two types of people. There were those who looked at the evils of this world like war, racism and oppression and said, ""I'm going to stand on my principles because it's got to get a lot worse before it gets any better"", and then there were those who would say ""I've got to get to work to see if I can make it at least better.""""I'm with the second group,"" he told me, ""because if I took the first view I would be allowing too many people to continue to suffer while I, maintaining my ideological purity, refused to do anything to help them.""""At that point in the convention"", he continued, ""it was no longer Julian Bond versus Ed Muskie. It was Hubert Humphrey versus Richard Nixon and I had to make a choice as to who would help make life at least a little bit better.""I never forgot that lesson and am challenged daily to apply it. It is the reason why I have so little patience for ideologues from the right or the left. They wear their purity with great pride. They arrogantly dismiss those with whom they disagree and never see the need to engage differing opinions. Because they see themselves as bearers of the only truth, they are quick to denounce others, as they say, ""with clarity and conviction.""From high on their pinnacle of purity, they often miss the muck of the reality in which most of us live and the tough and often less than perfect choices with which we are confronted in the never-ending challenge we face to make life a little bit better -whether in the struggle for human rights, improvements in the quality of life, or the provision of security and justice for those who are most vulnerable.And so, at his passing, I am compelled to say ""for the life you lived, the leadership you demonstrated, the victories you won, and especially for the lessons you taught, thank you Julian Bond"".Follow @AAIUSA for more."

Fifty years ago this month marks the uprising in the Watts community of Los Angeles, California in 1965. Spurred by the kind of tense police encounters that minorities fear but that have been a feature of urban American life, the upheaval in Watts demonstrates the utility and futility of urban protest. The Watts uprising illustrates how unforseen setbacks often saddle racial progress. The aftermath offers instructive insights on how activists might craft short-term and long-term visions of justice that can avert the trends of racial progress and relapse. What was the Watts Uprising? On August 6, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law. The law (which was disemboweled by the Supreme Court in 2012 and has few signs of being restored) was one of the feathers in the cap of the Civil Rights Movement. A week later, a white police officer, Lee Minkus, stopped a black driver, Marquette Frye, in Watts (a predominantly African American community) for reckless driving. Frye's mother, Rena Frye, lived close to the place of arrest and came to retrieve the car and scold her son. Stories diverge from here. According to Marquette Frye, he was hit over the head by one cop. An officer also twisted Ms. Frye's arm behind her back in an attempt to arrest her and caused her to cry out in pain. According to Minkus, the 49-year-old mother agitated the situation by jumping on his back after the allegedly drunk Frye yelled at him ""go ahead, kill me."" This all occurred in the view of about 500 people. Since we are devoid of the kind of camera footage that is increasingly documenting police deception, what really happened will always be up for debate. Regardless of what precipitated the arrest, rumors circulated that police beat a pregnant woman and chaos ensued. The result was one of the largest riots in American history, with 34 casualties and $40 million in damage after a week of upheaval. The Watts uprising is especially significant because it bucked the social movement strategy of non-violence that was in vogue at the time and received unprecedented media coverage.There were smaller protests in Philadelphia, Rochester, and New York a year before Watts, but these previous upheavals paled in comparison to Watts in death-count and property damage. The events in Watts were a break from how ""race riots"" traditionally operated. Historically, such riots often involved white attacks on black communities (e.g. Atlanta in 1906, Springfield in 1908, Elaine, Knoxville, Chicago, and Omaha in 1919, Tulsa in 1921, to name a few). After Watts, blacks began to turn their anger toward white-owned businesses in their segregated neighborhoods and occasionally toward innocent whites who were at the wrong place at the wrong time. Civil rights activist Bayard Rustin put it best when he claimed, ""the whole point of the outbreak in Watts was that it marked the first major rebellion of Negroes against their own masochism and was carried on with the express purpose of asserting that they would no longer quietly submit to the deprivation of slum life.""There were existing cultures of armed black resistance in North Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana. But these forms of black retaliation did not receive the kind of media scrutiny as the Watts uprising--a scrutiny that was only intensified by the advent of helicopter coverage of the upheaval. Watts was different. It cultivated an ethos of armed militancy that partly inspired organizations like the Black Panther Party, the Brown Berets, and the Young Lords. These days cities have developed strategies to attenuate the possibility of large-scale uprisings like Watts by militarizing their police forces and incorporating racial minorities across sectors of government. To be sure, these strategies were learned primarily from Watts as well as the various urban upheavals of 1967 and 1968. Nevertheless, determined activists have demonstrated in Baltimore and Ferguson that they have no problem continuing the urban protest tradition that existed before and beyond Watts, albeit with refined tactics. (F)utility and Change Accordingly, the Watts uprising is significant for one more enduring reason. It shows that in some instances, urban protest can simultaneously work and be unproductive. Historian Gerald Horne, author of the authoritative book on the events in Watts notes, ""uprisings like those in Watts are akin to a toothache in that they alert the body politic that something is dangerously awry. Their dramatic nature...can motivate sweeping social reform and/or repression.""When a Watts resident was questioned about how the community benefitted from the upheaval, the man responded, ""we won because we made the whole world pay attention to us. The police chief never came here before; the mayor always stayed uptown. We made them come."" He was correct. Contrary to one author's recent insistence in Time that these riots ""did nothing for black America, government did respond (although the quality of their response is a separate matter). Before the riots, then-mayor Sam Yorty ignored racial inequality in the city and stubbornly prevented federal War on Poverty funds from being distributed to poor communities in LA. After the upheaval, funds magically appeared for black and Latino community action programs across the city. Soon thereafter, police brutality and chronic unemployment--issues that multiracial coalitions of activists complained about for years--suddenly received more scrutiny from politicians and academics. For decades, black doctors pleaded with the federal government for a hospital in the medical desert that was Watts, but to no avail. After the riots, local, state, and federal governments cobbled together funds to establish a much-needed hospital and medical school, which created jobs for blue-collar and white-collar minority professionals. In 1973, the city even elected its first black mayor, Tom Bradley, who ruled over the city for twenty years and was able to forge seemingly unimaginable alliances amongst Blacks and Jews as well as labor and business reforms. The strife of Watts in 1965 and subsequent dissatisfaction generated Bradley's success; preeminent California historian Kevin Starr commented, ""I know of no one with a greater gift for reconciliation and healing."" As grisly as it sounds, in many ways the riot ""worked."" But the events in Watts did not come without consequences. In the same ways that the riot galvanized blacks and allowed them and other ethnic groups to put black leadership in place in LA, it also invigorated whites on a state level. The riot, along with other upheavals in 1967 and 1968, helped solidify suburban conservatism in the state as well as a law and order movement that sought to tame putatively unruly minorities. This social conservatism and tough on crime mentality were central to Ronald Reagan's playbook. These moves allowed him to mosey into governorship of California from 1967 to 1975 and strut into the White House 1980-1988.Watts wasn't the main cause of Reagan's success but it was unquestionably in the mind of white voters. Once Reagan became president, he gutted the remaining War on Poverty programs that were not already decimated by Nixon. Various government commissions investigated the causes of riots in the late 1960s. Although many of these causes were not novel news to poor blacks, the local and federal government's lack of consistent commitment to post-Watts initiatives rendered their solutions ineffective. Today, unused commercial space and shoddily-planned residential housing in Watts abound. Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital--the hospital that was created after the riots to address unmet health care needs in the region--closed in 2007 after a variety of management problems. It reopened last month and only time will tell if it will if will meet its mission. In hindsight, it is hard to not agree with Marquette Frye, who grumbled 20 years after his arrest, ""after the revolt, they fed us pacification programs."" The uprising cannot be characterized as a categorical win or loss.The Impasse of Race Relations Such a stalemate is representative of the almost cha-cha slide-like nature of race relations. Progression then regression. People on the left maintain that although there have been some advancements, in the larger racial order of things, very little has changed. Their position is convincing. They are often armed with statistics that demonstrate the obnoxious and longitudinal persistence of segregation, racially disproportionate unemployment, and educational inequality.Individuals on the right have a more sanguine view of things. They insist that race relations have transformed in the past half-century. They point to the explosion of the black middle-class, the proliferation of black multi-millionaires, diversified police bureaucracies, and a black president as incontrovertible evidence of racial progress. Some of these individuals might concede that racial bigotry exists--but this is usually understood as a ""bad apple"" problem. A cop who shoots a retreating black person or an ideologue who shoots up a black church are considered individual actors, but certainly not emblematic of systematic bias. In this camp's view, systems and institutions have been fumigated of the odious racism that dominated the United States in your grandparents' lifetime. Watts illustrates how both sides can be right. Today, Watts sits in a larger county of Los Angeles that has one of the most diverse police forces in the country. Such diversity can reduce the possibility of racialized police violence but it is no surety. Bullets, particularly cop bullets, have no name and they can come from the gun of a white, black, Latino, or Asian American cop. But statistically speaking, they are likely to enter a black and brown body. For example, African Americans comprise 9% of the city's population but account for 19% of police shootings and 31% of less serious use-of-force cases. So while police diversity offers the kinds of benefits that are missed by a media that is finally paying serious attention to police brutality, it is no racial charm. Economic life amongst racial minorities also has the kind of booms and busts that support both sides of the progress debate. Since the early 1900s, there has always been a sizable black middle-class in the City of Angels. The movement (but not elimination) of barriers in Hollywood ostensibly increased the collective lot of black Angelinos. The same could be said about the under-discussed Latino middle-class, who has become an important bloc in city and county politics. Population growth and increasing median income suggest that such political power will be national soon. But modest economic improvements cannot completely address black Los Angelinos' disproportionately poor health outcomes, bleak employment prospects, and the hemorrhaging of their population due to increasing housing costs and discrimination. Indeed, the Housing Authority of Los Angeles County is fresh off of a $2 million dollar settlement related to housing discrimination against blacks and Latinos. Minorities challenged these matters of inequality in health, housing, and employment before the Watts uprisings; similar issues resonate today in big cities across the country. Latinos, who now make up the majority of Watts residents, are not unscathed by seesawing racial and economic progress. In Los Angeles, the wage theft capital of the United States, Latinos--particularly women and the undocumented--are primary targets of non-payment or underpayment for services performed. They have the highest rate of income insufficiency (e.g. ability to have an adequate standard of living). Like their black counterparts, they also encounter housing affordability problems. Although their social circumstances are slightly different than African Americans, Latinos' demands are not that different from black Los Angelinos pre and post-1965: dignified and reasonably-paid work, affordable housing, quality education, and freedom from police violence.As the country continues to deal with racial strife, fatal police encounters, and dogged economic inequality, the Watts protests has instructional value for advocates of racial justice and their adversaries. For the former, short-term improvements can prove to be fruitful and can be an important respite from the daily onslaught of racial oppression. But racial activists must be mindful of the ways their conservative (and sometimes liberal) opponents can play the long-game and reverse hard-fought gains. At the same time, opponents of racial progress better recognize that the oppressed will not sit by passively. Martin Luther King's comments after the Watts uprisings are applicable to more recent protests. ""The key error of both Negro and white leadership was in expecting the ghettos to stand still and in underestimating the deterioration that increasingly embittered its life."" Baltimore and Ferguson are no Watts, but that does not mean that people will be content with the two-steps forward, one-step back nature of American racial change."

For decades, black doctors pleaded with the federal government for a hospital in the medical desert that was Watts, but to no avail. After the riots, local, state, and federal governments cobbled together funds to establish a much-needed hospital and medical school, which created jobs for blue-collar and white-collar minority professionals. In 1973, the city even elected its first black mayor, Tom Bradley, who ruled over the city for twenty years and was able to forge seemingly unimaginable alliances amongst Blacks and Jews as well as labor and business reforms. The strife of Watts in 1965 and subsequent dissatisfaction generated Bradley's success; preeminent California historian Kevin Starr commented, ""I know of no one with a greater gift for reconciliation and healing."" As grisly as it sounds, in many ways the riot ""worked."" But the events in Watts did not come without consequences. In the same ways that the riot galvanized blacks and allowed them and other ethnic groups to put black leadership in place in LA, it also invigorated whites on a state level. The riot, along with other upheavals in 1967 and 1968, helped solidify suburban conservatism in the state as well as a law and order movement that sought to tame putatively unruly minorities. This social conservatism and tough on crime mentality were central to Ronald Reagan's playbook. These moves allowed him to mosey into governorship of California from 1967 to 1975 and strut into the White House 1980-1988.Watts wasn't the main cause of Reagan's success but it was unquestionably in the mind of white voters. Once Reagan became president, he gutted the remaining War on Poverty programs that were not already decimated by Nixon. Various government commissions investigated the causes of riots in the late 1960s. Although many of these causes were not novel news to poor blacks, the local and federal government's lack of consistent commitment to post-Watts initiatives rendered their solutions ineffective. Today, unused commercial space and shoddily-planned residential housing in Watts abound. Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital--the hospital that was created after the riots to address unmet health care needs in the region--closed in 2007 after a variety of management problems. It reopened last month and only time will tell if it will if will meet its mission. In hindsight, it is hard to not agree with Marquette Frye, who grumbled 20 years after his arrest, ""after the revolt, they fed us pacification programs."" The uprising cannot be characterized as a categorical win or loss.The Impasse of Race Relations Such a stalemate is representative of the almost cha-cha slide-like nature of race relations. Progression then regression. People on the left maintain that although there have been some advancements, in the larger racial order of things, very little has changed. Their position is convincing. They are often armed with statistics that demonstrate the obnoxious and longitudinal persistence of segregation, racially disproportionate unemployment, and educational inequality.Individuals on the right have a more sanguine view of things. They insist that race relations have transformed in the past half-century. They point to the explosion of the black middle-class, the proliferation of black multi-millionaires, diversified police bureaucracies, and a black president as incontrovertible evidence of racial progress. Some of these individuals might concede that racial bigotry exists--but this is usually understood as a ""bad apple"" problem. A cop who shoots a retreating black person or an ideologue who shoots up a black church are considered individual actors, but certainly not emblematic of systematic bias. In this camp's view, systems and institutions have been fumigated of the odious racism that dominated the United States in your grandparents' lifetime. Watts illustrates how both sides can be right. Today, Watts sits in a larger county of Los Angeles that has one of the most diverse police forces in the country. Such diversity can reduce the possibility of racialized police violence but it is no surety. Bullets, particularly cop bullets, have no name and they can come from the gun of a white, black, Latino, or Asian American cop. But statistically speaking, they are likely to enter a black and brown body. For example, African Americans comprise 9% of the city's population but account for 19% of police shootings and 31% of less serious use-of-force cases. So while police diversity offers the kinds of benefits that are missed by a media that is finally paying serious attention to police brutality, it is no racial charm. Economic life amongst racial minorities also has the kind of booms and busts that support both sides of the progress debate. Since the early 1900s, there has always been a sizable black middle-class in the City of Angels. The movement (but not elimination) of barriers in Hollywood ostensibly increased the collective lot of black Angelinos. The same could be said about the under-discussed Latino middle-class, who has become an important bloc in city and county politics. Population growth and increasing median income suggest that such political power will be national soon. But modest economic improvements cannot completely address black Los Angelinos' disproportionately poor health outcomes, bleak employment prospects, and the hemorrhaging of their population due to increasing housing costs and discrimination. Indeed, the Housing Authority of Los Angeles County is fresh off of a $2 million dollar settlement related to housing discrimination against blacks and Latinos. Minorities challenged these matters of inequality in health, housing, and employment before the Watts uprisings; similar issues resonate today in big cities across the country. Latinos, who now make up the majority of Watts residents, are not unscathed by seesawing racial and economic progress. In Los Angeles, the wage theft capital of the United States, Latinos--particularly women and the undocumented--are primary targets of non-payment or underpayment for services performed. They have the highest rate of income insufficiency (e.g. ability to have an adequate standard of living). Like their black counterparts, they also encounter housing affordability problems. Although their social circumstances are slightly different than African Americans, Latinos' demands are not that different from black Los Angelinos pre and post-1965: dignified and reasonably-paid work, affordable housing, quality education, and freedom from police violence.As the country continues to deal with racial strife, fatal police encounters, and dogged economic inequality, the Watts protests has instructional value for advocates of racial justice and their adversaries. For the former, short-term improvements can prove to be fruitful and can be an important respite from the daily onslaught of racial oppression. But racial activists must be mindful of the ways their conservative (and sometimes liberal) opponents can play the long-game and reverse hard-fought gains. At the same time, opponents of racial progress better recognize that the oppressed will not sit by passively. Martin Luther King's comments after the Watts uprisings are applicable to more recent protests. ""The key error of both Negro and white leadership was in expecting the ghettos to stand still and in underestimating the deterioration that increasingly embittered its life."" Baltimore and Ferguson are no Watts, but that does not mean that people will be content with the two-steps forward, one-step back nature of American racial change."
25,POLITICS,The Carter Presidency Revisited,"Bennet Kelley, ContributorHost, Cyber Law and Business Report; political columnist; inte...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-carter-presidency-rev_b_8025974.html,"Since Democrats raced to distance themselves from Carter with almost as much vigor as Republican embraced him, the Carter failure meme has gone unchallenged for 35 years.

Since Democrats raced to distance themselves from Carter with almost as much vigor as Republican embraced him, the Carter failure meme has gone unchallenged for 35 years. With Carter's announcement that he is fighting advanced cancer, maybe it is time to set the record straight.Let me be clear from the outset, I am by no means a Carter apologist. I first entered politics partly because I was unhappy to see Carter win the nomination in 1976 and was a strong Kennedy supporter in 1980. I also will concede that regardless of what I may say on this page, the most important determination on the Carter presidency occurred on November 4, 1980 when voters overwhelmingly decided to change course.That vote, however, cannot change how consequential the Carter presidency remains today. The only Naval Academy graduate to serve in the White House, President Carter has an enormous foreign policy legacy. He took office after a decade that saw three Arab-Israeli wars and the murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics, yet managed to forge a historic agreement at Camp David that, according to at least one Middle East scholar ""reshaped the Arab world . . . and in doing so, strengthened immeasurable the U.S. position in the Middle East."" More importantly, it fostered a period of relative peace in the region.(Photo Credit: Tal Shabtai [CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons)Carter also reshaped Latin America, with the Panama Canal Treaty and cut off of military aid to repressive regimes in Argentina and Brazil. In doing so, Carter signaled that the days of Yankee Gunboat Diplomacy was over (at least temporarily).Carter was the first U.S. president to put human rights at the forefront of foreign policy. Carter's emphasis on human rights and use of the CIA to smuggle in pro-democracy texts into the Soviet bloc played an important role in fostering the anti-Soviet activism that led to the collapse of Soviet control over Eastern Europe. While Republicans often cite Reagan's military buildup as contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Union, rarely do they mention that it began under President Carter. When the Soviets challenged Carter, he acted forcefully by arming the mujahideen in Afghanistan to give the Soviets their own Vietnam-like catastrophe, proceeding on the MX Missile Program, reinstating draft registration and boycotting the Moscow Olympics. More importantly, unlike past Presidents who did little to prevent Soviet military action in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, as 27 Soviet and Warsaw Pact divisions amassed on the Polish border ready to invade to crush the nascent Solidarity movement, Carter publicly and privately signaled to the Soviets that there would be ""very adverse consequences"". These were not mere words, as Carter had a retaliatory strategy in place with key allies that included a plan to immobilized much of the Soviet merchant fleet. Poland's leader later indicated that Carter's actions and the Soviets' difficulties in Afghanistan led to their abandoning invasion plans.Then there is Iran. The hostage crisis and failed rescue attempt was an albatross that hung over Carter, no more so than on election day which happened to be the first anniversary of the hostage crisis. Carter deserves credit for getting all hostages home safely and would have done so sooner but for an apparent deal that the Reagan campaign had agreed to provide arms to Iran in exchange for delaying the hostages release.Domestically, Carter had to deal with an economy in a state of shock from two Arab oil embargoes, the release of Nixon-era price controls and the continued decline of manufacturing jobs due to foreign competition. Once again, he did so forcefully with an aggressive energy policy that included establishing the Department of Energy, promoting alternative fuels and the establishing fuel efficiency standards in automobiles. Had subsequent administration's followed his path and continued to increase fuel efficiency standards, we would have stopped importing oil years ago.His legacy also includes the creation of the Department of Education, expanding Pell Grants to an additional 1.5 million families, airline deregulation which has made air travel more affordable and doubling the size of the National Parks through the addition of 43 million acres in Alaska.Carter could have achieved far more, including national health care, had he been a better communicator and not antagonized Congressional Democrats. This, along with disarray within his administration, undermined Carter as a leader and was part of what led me to campaign for Ted Kennedy in 1980.It is curious to see Republicans continue to bash President Carter as a failure when he makes his Republican successors look more like the JV-team. Carter outperformed all of them in job creation and both Bush presidencies in GDP growth, while actually lowering the deficit. While there is consensus that Carter has been our greatest ex-President, it is time that we also acknowledge in his lifetime what his Presidency achieved and its continued legacy."

Mexico acting up? No matter; he'll hop on the phone and curse Mexico out. China spiffing us in trade deals? Who cares! A solution is a phone call and an immature insult away. ""Your country sucks, China!"" Problem solved. Except while that might work on TV, it would backfire in reality. As several commentators have already pointed out, Trump's ""refusal to act diplomatically [would be] catastrophic for the lead diplomat of the United States."" Diplomacy requires subtlety, tact and restraint -- something everyone from Sun Tzu to Henry Kissinger agrees on. But screaming insults like a petulant toddler? That sort of behavior is best left on The Apprentice.  I'm not saying business experience has no place in politics. It obviously does. Outsiders bring valuable insights into the political process, and a more realistic representation of how business works -- stressing restraint and negotiation over needless offense -- translates extremely well into international diplomacy. But Trump's view of how his own bombastic business personality would play in the political realm is remarkably shortsighted. He speaks of countries as if they were individuals, and he acts like solutions to complex problems lie in three-word slogans. That pithy ideology might work for Trump's personal life, but it would spell disaster if adopted by the president of the United States. In Trump's worldview as presented thus far, one gets the impression that Israel-Palestine can be solved by a few stern phone calls and maybe a fancy steak dinner afterwards. If that fails, then bombs should do the trick. Yeah right.  Obviously, Trump's oversimplification of international relations has appeal. Most people don't have the background knowledge, the patience, or the time to truly consider the intricacies of, say, the development of ISIL. As Robert Greene writes in The 48 Laws of Power, short mantras have an intrinsic draw, a resonance that longer, more nuanced takes on things just don't have. And that's fine -- for the average citizen. But the president of the United States, wielding a governmental branch clothed in immense executive power, should have a more thorough understanding of foreign policy. He or she should understand that illegal immigration is not a problem the Mexican government alone can control, or that empirical evidence suggests undocumented immigrants actually commit less crime than native-born Americans. He or she should acknowledge that a disgusting phenomenon like ISIL has complex political, religious, and historical underpinnings that will not be, cannot be, dismantled by a few well-placed explosives -- rhetorical or military. A responsible president should know that criticisms of China and Japan for manipulating currency should be restrained and qualified, to acknowledge (for example) Japan's two decades of careful economic policy aimed at counteracting slumping fiscal performance. And so on. Because in foreign policy, jabs aren't taken lightly; and unlike in Trump's business affairs, insulting a country ticks off a heck of a lot more people than the one person on the other side of the phone line. Business isn't simple; foreign policy isn't either. If Trump wants to be taken seriously by the general electorate, he should demonstrate the nuanced understanding of foreign policy exemplified by candidates ranging from Jeb Bush to Hillary Clinton.  As things stand now, the world is far too dangerous and complex a place for Donald Trump to be at its helm, his hand hovering over the nuclear button, ready to shout ""you're fired!"" at anyone who ticks him off."
