0,POLITICS,"Bernie Sanders Supporters Unleash Sexist, Nasty Attacks On Nevada's Dem Chair",Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-nevada-dem-chair_us_573b4b8de4b0aee7b8e7dfa2,Just listen to the voicemails Roberta Lange has received.,2016-05-17,"Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders react as U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) speaks during the Nevada State Democratic Party's 2016 convention at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel on May 14, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573b88d31600002a00f93950.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's no secret that some supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are deeply convinced the Democratic Party's presidential nomination process is rigged, unethical and inherently corrupt.They've protested front-runner Hillary Clinton's wins in a number of states under the guise that the rules are too restrictive and the party too partial for the results to be valid. Some have legitimate grievances about the primary process, while others are just tapping into conspiracy theories. The end result is the same: increasingly nasty attacks on officials in the Democratic Party.The worst bits of this surfaced on Saturday at the Nevada Democratic Party convention, when a near-riot broke out. The state party chairwoman, Roberta Lange, has been deluged with threatening and sexist voicemails and text messages in the days since.At issue was an attempt by the Sanders campaign to try to change convention rules and seat additional delegates. When roughly 60 potential delegates were deemed ineligible because they had not registered as Democrats by the deadline, tempers flared. Then, the convention was forced to end abruptly around 10 p.m. because security staff said delegates couldn't stay any later. (For a more thorough breakdown of what happened, read Jon Ralston's take.)Sanders supporters blamed Lange for undermining their efforts, and they lashed out accordingly. Some of the reaction was reported Monday by The New York Times.But that was just the tip of the iceberg. The Huffington Post obtained additional texts and voicemails sent to Lange, as well as footage from inside the Paris Las Vegas Hotel, where the convention was held. The texts and calls, which came after Lange's phone number and address were posted on Twitter, threatened violence and contained sexist epithets. One person threatened to buy a home near Lange, while another encouraged her to ""prepare for hell.""Here are some of the texts Lange received:The voicemails (some of which were posted by Ralston) were more jarring. ""You are a sick, twisted piece of shit and I hope you burn for this!"" one said. Here are recordings of that one and 10 others.One caller even told Lange to commit suicide, in a voicemail her aide described as the most threatening one received.""You should be tried for treason, stripped of all authority that you think that you have. All your property, everything. You should be hung in the middle of town, till dead. You are a disgrace to the American people. You should just commit suicide. You're a disgrace. You're horrible. Nobody wants you in power. You are a dirt bag. You are the reason why we are voting for Bernie Sanders,"" the caller said.The Sanders campaign has responded to the threats by saying it doesn't condone violence, as well as by encouraging Democrats to ""figure out a way to welcome people who have been energized and excited by his campaign into the party."" Some Democrats have deemed this an insufficient attempt to tamp down the rhetoric and emotions.However, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday that he talked to Sanders the day before, and the two had a ""very good"" conversation.""He said that he condemns that, and I’m confident he does,"" Reid told reporters. ""This is a test of leadership.""But Sanders ducked a question on the Las Vegas incident while on the trail Tuesday. And Lange, in an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday, said she had not heard from the Sanders campaign. Later on Tuesday afternoon, Sanders campaign press secretary Michael Briggs released a lengthy and largely unapologetic statement on the incident in which Sanders urged the party to be more accommodating to his supporters and said leaders in Nevada had used their power ""to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place."" He simultaneously said he disavows violence and harassment and that his campaign ""believes in non-violent change.""In the meantime, the anger unleashed Saturday has spilled beyond the political realm. Tom Gallagher, a majority partner in the tavern where Lange serves as operations manager, said the bar has been getting threatening phone calls since 3 a.m. Sunday. Eventually, they had to shut down their phones, only to watch as they were bombarded online.The tavern's Facebook page and website were overtaken by people demanding that Lange be fired. Someone created a phony Facebook account for Lange that accused her of ""scurrilous stuff"" -- as Gallagher put it -- and claimed her husband had committed crimes against children. Someone managed to alter the Google search results so it appeared the tavern was permanently closed. ""I've been in politics for 50 years now,"" said Gallagher, who ran for Congress in 2004. ""And I think Bernie is losing control of his people. These are folks out there who have no concept about rational political discourse. Now a lot of Bernie's folks are really good friends of mine and they're embarrassed by this. But there are crazies out there that are truly a little scary.""Sanders' statement released Tuesday afternoon read in part: Within the last few days there have been a number of criticisms made against my campaign organization. Party leaders in Nevada, for example, claim that the Sanders campaign has a ‘penchant for violence.’ That is nonsense. Our campaign has held giant rallies all across this country, including in high-crime areas, and there have been zero reports of violence. Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals. But, when we speak of violence, I should add here that months ago, during the Nevada campaign, shots were fired into my campaign office in Nevada and apartment housing complex my campaign staff lived in was broken into and ransacked.If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned. I am happy to say that has been the case at state conventions in Maine, Alaska, Colorado and Hawaii where good discussions were held and democratic decisions were reached. Unfortunately, that was not the case at the Nevada convention. At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place.This post has been updated with a Sanders campaign statement and comment from Harry Reid."

With his status as the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee seemingly locked up, Trump’s previous prediction that there would be “riots” if he were denied the nod no longer seems to be a significant concern. Moreover, the Department of Homeland Security has designated the Republican convention a “national special security event,” as it has the Democratic convention the following week. And in downtown Cleveland, the Secret Service is laying out an extremely restrictive security perimeter that will surround Quicken Loans Arena.More daunting, however, is what might happen outside the security perimeter. Some in Cleveland fear that the violence that Trump has frequently encouraged at his own rallies will spill over onto the city's streets, where the combination of passionate protesters, vehement Trump backers and questionably prepared police officers threatens to create a toxic brew.“I’m very, very concerned,” said Steve Loomis, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, which is the union that represents the city’s cops. “The rank-and-file guy -- the average cop who doesn’t have a horse or doesn’t have a bicycle or an undercover position with a bunch of feds — the average guy in the street that’s going to be on that line is almost as untrained as you can be.”If Loomis' concerns come true, it won't be due to a lack of funding. The federal government gave Cleveland a $50 million security grant for the convention, $20 million of which the city has said that it plans to spend on equipment and $30 million to be directed toward personnel.Through a public bidding process, Cleveland has sought to purchase an array of equipment to deal with crowd control and potential unrest, including 2,000 riot suits and batons for its own force and for units from around the country that will be coming to assist. But there have been some significant hitches in training and other preparations for dealing with the street disruptions that are all but inevitable during the convention. Loomis pointed specifically to delays in equipping officers with mountain bikes, which the city promised to purchase, and said that officers who’d been assigned to the convention had taken a three-day training course several months ago but haven’t been brought back together since. “We don’t know where gas masks are coming from at this point,” he said. “We don’t know where helmets are coming from at this point. Everybody’s issued a plastic riot helmet when you get out of the academy. Well, my 23-year-old plastic riot helmet is sitting in disrepair in my locker because we haven’t used them.”Loomis said that the right to gather and protest was “what’s great about this country,” but added that Cleveland police will have a “zero tolerance” policy toward any civil disobedience that crosses the line into violent confrontation.The city has a long history of unrest set off by racial tensions, including the protests after a white police officer fatally shot Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black child who was holding a toy gun, in 2014.Cleveland is also heavily Democratic. While all major-party U.S. political conventions in memory have seen demonstrations, the prospect of an event there designed to celebrate a nominee as controversial and provocative as Trump is particularly worrisome.Cleveland police officials don’t yet have estimates for how many groups and individual protesters will descend on Cleveland during the week of July 18. There doesn't appear to be a single national protest organization that is coordinating mass efforts. Instead, groups of varied interests and intentions are expected to converge on the city.A group called The Coalition to Stop Trump and March on the RNC is among several organizations that have applied for permits to stage what it promises will be a “major protest” on the convention’s first day.As one of the most turbulent primary campaigns in GOP history comes to its culmination, national Republican officials have sought to project calm and stability, noting that the party's convention organizers have been involved in making preparations in Cleveland for over a year. Two former Secret Service agents have been heading the RNC's security staff in the city for several months, coordinating with federal and local law enforcement agencies there. “We’ve been in the middle of this process of getting help from law enforcement agencies around Ohio for a long time, and it’s going to continue,” said Kirsten Kukowski, communications director for the Republican convention. “Those conversations happen every convention, and it’s always come together, and we’re very confident the same thing is going to happen. We’re extremely confident that we’re going to have the help we need.”Cleveland’s public safety director has similarly expressed confidence that they will have the personnel and equipment required to keep the peace, although city officials have generally been tight-lipped about the details of those security plans. The public information officer for the Cleveland Division of Police referred questions about convention security to the Mayor’s Office of Communications, where an official did not respond to an interview request.Some Cleveland officials have privately accused Steve Loomis of being alarmist — a charge that the police union president embraces as a justified reaction to the current state of affairs. “You’re damn right I’m panic-mongering because I’m terrified I’m going to have a bunch of hurt policemen and citizens at the end of this thing, needlessly, because we don’t have the equipment we need and we don’t have the training we should have,” Loomis said.

Some witnesses reported hearing a colossal ""boom"" after it touched down, according to the American Meteor Society (AMS).The non-profit, which collects data on meteoric phenomena, says it received more than 170 reports from people in nine U.S. states and in Canada.""The fireball was seen primarily from Maine but witnesses from Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Ontario (Canada) and Québec (Canada) also reported the event,” AMS reported.Maine's Portland Police Department was among those that released video of the incredible sight. It was one they playfully hinted as being linked to creatures from another world.""Sgt. Farris was looking for speeder's while parked in front of the central fire station and was able to observe some visitors 'from away'....far away,"" the department posted on Facebook. ""The meteor (or alien spaceship) was caught on camera at approximately 0050 hours. Let's hope the visitors are friendly. They could just be some of Stephen King's friends on there (sic) way to visit him. Whom ever they are I'm sure we could win them over with a whoopie pie.""The AMS defines a fireball as a very bright meteor, one that gives off a light that’s brighter than the planet Venus -- a magnitude -4 -- in the morning or evening sky. A bolide fireball is a type that explodes, giving off a bright flash and often with visible fragmentation."

5,ENTERTAINMENT,'Neighbors 2' Takes On Sexism And Double Standards In An Unexpected Way,Stephanie Marcus,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neighbors-2-stars-beanie-feldstein-and-kiersey-clemons_us_5738af6de4b060aa781a9070,The film's sorority sisters Beanie Feldstein and Kiersey Clemons talk friendship and feminism.,2016-05-17,"""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" stars Kiersey Clemons and Beanie Feldstein.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5738b2d3160000b60731ec4f.png?cache=ZCUT3xL9zW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After three college freshman learn how the Greek system forbids sororities from throwing parties in their own houses, they decide to form their own, in which no one can tell them no -- least of all their next-door neighbors. That's the basic plot of the very funny ""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising.""The film operates on a simple premise that's all about a double standard, but it's a real one. Almost every sorority in the country that's tied to a national organization does not allow its members to drink alcohol and throw parties in chapter houses the way fraternities are permitted to do. This is a real thing in 2016 -- it's not just a plot device for the movie. What's more, a 2014 Huffington Post/YouGov poll found that 58 percent of respondents agreed with the policy. The Huffington Post caught up with the films' stars Beanie Feldstein and Kiersey Clemons during a recent press day to chat about the film, which is as refreshingly progressive as it is hilarious.Like 2014's ""Neighbors,"" the sequel again pits married couple Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) against their college-aged neighbors. But since a sorority has moved in next door this time around, the film has a hearty dose of sisterhood and feminism. And it's better for it. The friendship between Shelby (Chloë Grace Moretz), Nora (Feldstein) and Beth (Clemons) is the heart of the movie. There's a palpable chemistry between the three actresses that comes from the fast bond they formed in the weeks prior to filming. ""We got to Atlanta about two weeks before we started shooting and [director] Nick [Stoller] would bring us in and we would do table reads and just work it through at the table,"" Feldstein, Jonah Hill's younger sister who makes her breakout performance in the film, told The Huffington Post in a recent phone interview. ""We talked about each of the characters and how they relate to each other. It's such a hugely important part of the movie, just believing this friendship and rooting for this friendship because it's the core of the story.""And much of their own bonding experiences ended up working into the film.""We were joking with Nick, like, 'Girls when they want to become close they just start heart-to-hearting.' So they kind of put that into one of our first scenes in the movie where it's just the three of us and we're kind of going over our high school lives, and ex-boyfriends and all this stuff. I think it's very true to how, at least my college experience, was the first two weeks of school. In order to get to know people you want to open up to them,"" Feldstein said. ""So we did that in our personal lives as far as as meeting each other, but we would also add it into the movie."" While five men are actually credited with writing the film, Seth Rogen told the Los Angeles Times that they sought out the perspectives of women and ""had a giant writers roundtable of female writers."" The filmmaking process, which both Feldstein and Clemons agreed was a collaborative experience, also drew inspiration from female cast members.""A lot of things that ended up in the movie were inspired by conversations that Nick Stoller, our director, would hear us having,"" Clemons, who's best known for her roles in the movie ""Dope"" and Amazon's ""Transparent,"" told HuffPost. Clemons said the three of them would be hanging out and someone would inevitably say something funny and they'd pitch it to Stoller. ""A lot of the movie is inspired by our actual friendship, which is always cool,"" she said. One particularly memorable scene was inspired by Clemons' and Moretz's synchronized menstrual cycles. ""The scene when we throw the tampons at the window, that was something that me and Chloë brought up,"" Clemons said. ""We were on our period at the same time and we were like, 'Oh, this is cool, we're hanging out so much that we're on our period at the same time.' And Nick was like, 'That happens?'""The movie has a distinctly feminist feel, but it's not something that's overtly discussed. (Stoller told the New York Daily News that they had to cut a running joke where they were constantly talking about feminism, but in the wrong way. ""When we tested it, the word feminism was so divisive to the audience that we literally had to cut the word out of the film,"" he said.) The joke is on any viewer who can't deal with hearing the F-word, and Feldstein has no problem using it.""I think we're all feminists that we're making the movie, from Nick across the board all the way down to me,"" she told HuffPost. ""The best thing about this movie is that it's giving jokes and giving scenarios to 18-year-old women that usually would be given to guys.""The movie also addresses the rape culture associated with Greek life with a fairly light touch -- the girls call the frat party they attend ""super rapey"" and are warned ""don't ever drink the punch."" Feldstein graduated in 2015 from Wesleyan University, a school that's had more than it's fair share of drama when it comes to the Greek system. In 2014, the school's officials announced that fraternities with campus houses would be required to become co-ed. The policy change came after the university's board of trustees asked its president to ""prepare a plan to address the future of Greek life"" after ""highly publicized incidents of sexual violence."" By the start of the 2015-16 school year, there were no frat houses left on campus. When asked if she had any personal thoughts on the situation at her alma mater, Feldstein said:""I just graduated a year ago, so it is pretty fresh. It was a very complicated topic and it was definitely something that was talked about a lot and debated and discussed and analyzed. And I think Wesleyan approached it in a great way. Obviously, there were improvements to be had, always, but I think it's better to be included and the most important thing is that you just feel safe. As far as it ties into the movie, in a lighthearted way it shows the Greek system is a little outdated and could use some improvements,"" she added. ""I like the idea of starting conversation and changing and progressing to match our society right now instead of staying kind of rooted in tradition.""""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" hits theaters May 20."
6,BLACK VOICES,Johnny Gill On His Return To The Top Of The Music Charts,Brennan Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/johnny-gill-return-music-charts_us_573a1795e4b077d4d6f3a963,The singer celebrates 32 years in the business and producing New Edition's developing biopic.,2016-05-17,"Johnny Gill opens up on career milestone, New Edition biopic, and more.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573a1a072200005707256b8e.jpeg?ops=crop_0_0_810_879%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"This is the latest installment in “Black In The Day,” an occasional HuffPost series about black entertainers taking an introspective look at their careers from back in the day.Three decades since releasing his self-titled debut album, Johnny Gill has mastered the game-winning formula that has left fans yearning for more of his timeless classics.The singer-songwriter's latest single, “This One’s For Me & You” -- featuring his New Edition bandmates -- marks his fourth number one R&B single. Despite the milestone, Gill’s triumphant return to the top of the charts wasn’t as smooth as it had been with some of his notable ballads in the 80s and 90s.Over the course of a 16-year-hiatus -- which ended in 2011 with the release of his album, “Still Winning” -- the R&B crooner was burdened with finding his niche as a veteran artist within music’s ever-shifting landscape of new music. During that time he managed to stay afloat financially by touring across the globe. Now, with the success of ""This One's For Me & You"" (from his 2014 album, “Game Changer”) and launch of his own label, J Skillz Entertainment, Gill is keeping busy by touring with New Edition and contributing to the group’s forthcoming album and biopic.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Gill opened up about his 30-plus year career in music, details on co-producing “New Edition: The Movie,” and explains why he’s disappointed with the state of today’s music.In what ways has your music evolved over the years?Every time we talk about singing or creating as an artist, in order for it to connect with people, it has to come from life experiences. And without a doubt, for me, all the stuff that comes from me comes from experience. And over the years, you live, your tastes change a lot, but one thing that has never changed for me -- when it came down to my art and what I do -- is just being open to receiving and being creative, and listen and continue doing different things. So for me, it’s just my experiences with things that make my music still connect for people to identify with. How does it feel to land your fourth number one hit with ""This One's For Me And You"" featuring New Edition? This is a milestone. And it’s like, you work, you put together a great product and a great album, which I think every artist to some degree feels every time they do it, “this is my best work.” But I had the opportunity to be able to not only feel that way, but also being in control of my own business, by having it come out on my own label, being my own boss, having the opportunity to do something that many don’t get the chance to do, and that is to be in control over my music.What was it like to reunite in the studio with New Edition? You guys are always touring together, but how would you describe the vibe recording together again? That was so much fun. We sat in there laughing and goofing off and it was like effortless with us being in the studio all together. I recorded my vocals first with Ricky [Bell] and Gregg [Pagani], and then we were on the road and the guys heard the song [when] we were sitting in the room playing some of the songs I had already worked on. So it was crazy, because by the time I had played that song they all looked at me and said, “C’mon man, we need to be up on this joint.” So I was in shock and I was like, “Whoa, y’all really want to be up on this one?” So I said, “alright.” I was just grateful that they wanted to be a part of it.”(Watch Johnny Gill's ""This One's For Me And You"" video below.)What are your thoughts on veteran artists appealing to younger audiences today? Have you found any challenges as a solo artist? Here’s my theory on this. I put this album out in 2014, we’re in 2016. I’m on my third single, we had two top ten records, and the number one single right now. And what I keep trying to tell everybody is, people keep saying “we know the industry has changed,” everybody keeps saying that, but the difference is nobody is accepting that the industry has changed. And there’s the difference. When I started recording this record, I knew I had something beyond special, and I mean, when I say beyond special, it wasn’t the norm. I often said that this [album] is my “Thriller.” I knew I had something special, but I also knew what uphill battle I had being in the business for 32 years. When you’re in the business for 32 years, you’re not celebrated for being here for 32 years, you’re just considered to be old school. So you gotta remember, now you gotta battle a great record, an older person and you’re old school. There’s a lot of battles to go through just to get your records played. So I jumped in knowing I got work ahead of me. I kept telling my whole crew and team every week, “losing is not an option.”What prompted your 16 year hiatus from music and what inspired you to start recording again? To be honest with you, nobody would give me a deal. So I made my living touring, even 16 years without a record. I was so stuck in the mindset that many older people who have been in the game for a long time, you’re looking for somebody to give you a deal. I ran into Jamie Foxx one day and he said, “Yo, there’s a void that’s missing. There’s no more Gerald [LeVert], there’s no more Luther [Vandross], there’s no more Teddy [Pendergrass], where are you? What’s going on? We need to hear from you.” And he said, “I have a studio at my crib and I have an engineer. My studio is yours. We need to hear from you.” After that a couple of opportunities came to the table out of nowhere about recording. And that’s what actually got the ball rolling; but other than that I was just thinking “it is, what it is.”BET recently announced the cast for the forthcoming New Edition biopic. What are your thoughts on Luke James portraying you? Did you personally recommend him for the role?I approved it. When I got the call that they wanted me to take a look at Luke and look at his audition tape, I also knew of him and was aware of his talent, and then having the chance to meet with him I said, “okay, I got my guy.”  In terms of Luke prepping for the role, what were some things you shared with him about you as a person and artist? I just gave him a quick synopsis of who I am. I’m not a very complex person, but there’s no in-between for me. I’m an extremist. So he understands that I can be the Martin Luther King of the group, and as a person when it comes to my friends I’m the guy that checks on everybody to make sure everybody is ok. And then, I’m also the guy when you hit the switch and you decide to hurt me, I can turn into this beast of another guy. So I told him, there’s no in-between for me when it comes down to my character. I just told him, “at the end of the day, this is gonna be more about what my role was when I came into the group.” What do you hope fans will take away from the biopic? There’s so much that we lived, and so much that we've done in the business for over 30 years, on top of our personal lives, and I know we can never tell it all. I just want that story to be told that we traveled and had a journey, and people can see it in the results. It’s just like with the record label that I started and where we are today, people see the end results of being number one, but they don’t know the journey. It hasn’t been a cake walk. And what I want people to come away with from the biopic is to see that in the end, the most important thing is that when you don’t lay down and don’t quit, there is redemption. Here we are 32 years later, being able to do what we’ve been doing for 32 years is beyond rare. But people may not understand what and how we’re able to do it, so this may give you some insight.  Throughout your career you’ve been a part various groups, ranging from your family's group to New Edition, LSG, and Heads of State. What are some of the biggest lessons you’ve learned?The thing that people don’t tell you about me is I’ve always been this guy. If you look at any of the groups, I’ve always been the guy that I don’t have to be out front. I don’t desire the attention. I know what I do and I just do it. And being a team player has been a part of my life and something that I’ve always looked at since day one. Teams win championships. And what I’ve realized many years ago, to come in when I came in with New Edition, there’s a role that I need to play. And I play my role. But I’ve never been the guy that felt like I need to be out front. I sometimes envy that, because there’s probably so much more I could’ve got done [professionally] if I had that kind of attitude, but I don’t. So I learned more than anything it’s always about being a team player. I always had the opportunity to do what I do as a solo artist and express myself artistically and then being able to come into groups and doing other stuff that I do, I come in with a different mindset.What are your thoughts on today’s R&B music? What are some pros and cons in comparison to the 80s, early 90s? The landscape of the industry has changed so much, that I’m so frustrated and disappointed. When it comes down to it, in the 80s and the 90s we were able to create classics. There’s not too many songs out today that you’re gonna be able to talk about “that’s gonna be a classic in 30 years.” Not because the songs aren’t great -- some of them are -- but because of the way the industry has changed it is unfathomable to believe you can have and create a great song that’s gonna be around for a long time. The system now with radio, everything is segregated and it is beyond frustrating.I always use the show “The Voice” as a prime example of what our business should be. With “The Voice,” they sit in these chairs and their backs are turned, all they know is what immediately strikes them from their ear makes them push the button to turn around. They don’t get a chance to look at the visuals to see you beforehand; they only have their ears. For the people listening to the radio, all they have is their ears. Radio has turned into, “how old are you? Oh, put him here on this side. What color are you? Put him over here.” It doesn’t matter about the record. Everything is so segregated and it never really allows people to get the full effect of a song that is magical. Back in the day, great music was just great music. And if it connected on one side of the fence, it was connecting all across, because they gave it an opportunity to do so for everybody."
7,BLACK VOICES,Johnny Gill On His Return To The Top Of The Music Charts,Brennan Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/johnny-gill-return-music-charts_us_573a1795e4b077d4d6f3a963,The singer celebrates 32 years in the business and producing New Edition's developing biopic.,2016-05-17,"(Left to Right) Johnny Gill, Ricky Bell, Ronnie DeVoe, Ralph Tresvant, Bobby Brown, Michael Bivins of New Edition",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573a1ad4130000f004381b85.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is the latest installment in “Black In The Day,” an occasional HuffPost series about black entertainers taking an introspective look at their careers from back in the day.Three decades since releasing his self-titled debut album, Johnny Gill has mastered the game-winning formula that has left fans yearning for more of his timeless classics.The singer-songwriter's latest single, “This One’s For Me & You” -- featuring his New Edition bandmates -- marks his fourth number one R&B single. Despite the milestone, Gill’s triumphant return to the top of the charts wasn’t as smooth as it had been with some of his notable ballads in the 80s and 90s.Over the course of a 16-year-hiatus -- which ended in 2011 with the release of his album, “Still Winning” -- the R&B crooner was burdened with finding his niche as a veteran artist within music’s ever-shifting landscape of new music. During that time he managed to stay afloat financially by touring across the globe. Now, with the success of ""This One's For Me & You"" (from his 2014 album, “Game Changer”) and launch of his own label, J Skillz Entertainment, Gill is keeping busy by touring with New Edition and contributing to the group’s forthcoming album and biopic.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Gill opened up about his 30-plus year career in music, details on co-producing “New Edition: The Movie,” and explains why he’s disappointed with the state of today’s music.In what ways has your music evolved over the years?Every time we talk about singing or creating as an artist, in order for it to connect with people, it has to come from life experiences. And without a doubt, for me, all the stuff that comes from me comes from experience. And over the years, you live, your tastes change a lot, but one thing that has never changed for me -- when it came down to my art and what I do -- is just being open to receiving and being creative, and listen and continue doing different things. So for me, it’s just my experiences with things that make my music still connect for people to identify with. How does it feel to land your fourth number one hit with ""This One's For Me And You"" featuring New Edition? This is a milestone. And it’s like, you work, you put together a great product and a great album, which I think every artist to some degree feels every time they do it, “this is my best work.” But I had the opportunity to be able to not only feel that way, but also being in control of my own business, by having it come out on my own label, being my own boss, having the opportunity to do something that many don’t get the chance to do, and that is to be in control over my music.What was it like to reunite in the studio with New Edition? You guys are always touring together, but how would you describe the vibe recording together again? That was so much fun. We sat in there laughing and goofing off and it was like effortless with us being in the studio all together. I recorded my vocals first with Ricky [Bell] and Gregg [Pagani], and then we were on the road and the guys heard the song [when] we were sitting in the room playing some of the songs I had already worked on. So it was crazy, because by the time I had played that song they all looked at me and said, “C’mon man, we need to be up on this joint.” So I was in shock and I was like, “Whoa, y’all really want to be up on this one?” So I said, “alright.” I was just grateful that they wanted to be a part of it.”(Watch Johnny Gill's ""This One's For Me And You"" video below.)What are your thoughts on veteran artists appealing to younger audiences today? Have you found any challenges as a solo artist? Here’s my theory on this. I put this album out in 2014, we’re in 2016. I’m on my third single, we had two top ten records, and the number one single right now. And what I keep trying to tell everybody is, people keep saying “we know the industry has changed,” everybody keeps saying that, but the difference is nobody is accepting that the industry has changed. And there’s the difference. When I started recording this record, I knew I had something beyond special, and I mean, when I say beyond special, it wasn’t the norm. I often said that this [album] is my “Thriller.” I knew I had something special, but I also knew what uphill battle I had being in the business for 32 years. When you’re in the business for 32 years, you’re not celebrated for being here for 32 years, you’re just considered to be old school. So you gotta remember, now you gotta battle a great record, an older person and you’re old school. There’s a lot of battles to go through just to get your records played. So I jumped in knowing I got work ahead of me. I kept telling my whole crew and team every week, “losing is not an option.”What prompted your 16 year hiatus from music and what inspired you to start recording again? To be honest with you, nobody would give me a deal. So I made my living touring, even 16 years without a record. I was so stuck in the mindset that many older people who have been in the game for a long time, you’re looking for somebody to give you a deal. I ran into Jamie Foxx one day and he said, “Yo, there’s a void that’s missing. There’s no more Gerald [LeVert], there’s no more Luther [Vandross], there’s no more Teddy [Pendergrass], where are you? What’s going on? We need to hear from you.” And he said, “I have a studio at my crib and I have an engineer. My studio is yours. We need to hear from you.” After that a couple of opportunities came to the table out of nowhere about recording. And that’s what actually got the ball rolling; but other than that I was just thinking “it is, what it is.”BET recently announced the cast for the forthcoming New Edition biopic. What are your thoughts on Luke James portraying you? Did you personally recommend him for the role?I approved it.

Islamic State, the ultra-hardline Sunni militants who control parts of north and west Iraq, have not tried to take the capital but carry out increasingly regular suicide bombings there, hitting Shi'ite areas and government targets.With the latest death tolls, fears are growing that Baghdad could relapse into the bloodletting of a decade ago when sectarian-motivated suicide bombings killed scores of people every week.This has cranked up pressure on Abadi who is struggling to solve a political crisis or risk losing control of parts of Baghdad to Islamic State militants. Away from the capital, Iraq's military is waging a counter offensive against the group.Abadi has said the crisis, sparked by his attempt to reshuffle the cabinet in an anti-corruption bid, is hampering the fight against Islamic State and creating space for more insurgent attacks on the civilian population.A spokesman for the Baghdad Operations Command told state television the attacker in al-Shaab had detonated an explosives-filled vest along with a planted bomb. Initial investigations revealed that the bomber was a woman, he said.Islamic State said in a statement distributed online by supporters that one of its fighters had targeted Shi'ite militiamen with hand grenade and a suicide vest. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the other two bombings.(Additional reporting by Saif Hameed and Mostafa Hashem in Cairo; Writing by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Raissa Kasolowsky)"

Gay marriage is still banned under local laws in many of Mexico's 31 states.Both the presidency and Pena Nieto's Twitter avatars were overlaid with the rainbow flag of gay pride to mark the international day against homophobia and transphobia.#Sinhomofobia, or #Nohomophobia, read banners on Pena Nieto's Twitter account.The announcement came just weeks after Pena Nieto proposed relaxing laws on marijuana.Grappling with deadly drug cartel violence, Pena Nieto last month sent a proposal to Congress to permit the use and importation of marijuana-based medicines. He also proposed raising the amount that marijuana users can legally carry to 28 grams from 5 grams.Growing and selling marijuana is illegal in Mexico but is the mainstay business of violent drug gangs. Pena Nieto has not said where consumers would be able to obtain the marijuana they would be allowed to carry.However, the proposal on marijuana is languishing in Congress.(Reporting by Mexico Newsroom; Writing by Simon Gardner; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

He previously filled a number of senior positions in the Department of Defense, including acting undersecretary of the Army, special assistant to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and undersecretary of the Air Force.President Barack Obama nominated Fanning in September, but his confirmation was delayed because of politics. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) put a hold on his nomination in November over his opposition to Obama’s push to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and transfer prisoners to facilities in the United States. In the meantime, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who chairs the Armed Services Committee, refused to give Fanning a hearing because he was irked that Fanning was serving as acting Army secretary while his confirmation was pending.The Pentagon alleviated McCain's concerns in January by reassigning Fanning to a staff position. On Tuesday, Roberts said he has gotten the ""assurances I need"" about Guantanamo and was ready to release his hold on Fanning.The Kansas senator said he personally called Fanning earlier in the day to tell him he was planning to let him through.""My issue has never been with Mr. Fanning's character, his courage or his capability,"" Roberts said on the Senate floor. ""He will be a tremendous leader.""Gay rights groups celebrated the news.""Eric’s sexual orientation has absolutely no bearing on his ability to do this job; nor was it the reason for his nomination,"" said Matt Thorn of OutServe-SLDN, which advocates for LGBT military personnel. ""But this milestone of having an openly gay individual in this high level position within the Department of Defense will help to continue to set a tone of understanding and respect for the LGBT community throughout the armed services."""

16,GREEN,World’s Smallest Porpoise Teetering On The Brink Of Extinction; Only 60 Left In The Wild,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vaquita-porpoise-almost-extinct_us_573ac611e4b077d4d6f3ea6b,The demand for illegal fish bladders is driving the vaquita's demise.,2016-05-17,"A dead vaquita, photographed in San Felipe, California in 1992. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573ac8c6130000d605381c68.jpeg?cache=fxSsye7KOF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You’ve probably never had the pleasure of seeing a vaquita in the wild. And unless action is immediately taken to protect this rare porpoise, you never will.The vaquita is the most endangered marine mammal on Earth, and according to a panel of scientists that’s been tracking the animal’s dwindling numbers, it’s now teetering dangerously close to extinction.In a statement released on Friday, the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita announced that only 60 vaquitas are left in the wild. This represents a decline of more than 92 percent since 1997.Without a dramatic improvement in conservation efforts, this porpoise will be wiped off the face of the planet by 2022.“We are watching this precious native species disappear before our eyes,” said panel chairman Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho.With their benign, snub-nosed faces and sweetly smiling mouths, vaquitas look more like Hayao Miyazaki characters than real creatures. Measuring about 5 feet in length, they’re the smallest of the cetaceans (dolphins, whales and porpoises), and the only porpoise species found in such warm waters.Residing in the northern end of Mexico’s Gulf of California, vaquitas have been under serious threat since the 1990s, mostly from long gill nets set by local fishermen to catch fish and shrimp. The porpoise get entangled in these nets and drown.The dangers facing vaquitas have only intensified in recent years, fueling a “catastrophic decline” of the species. The main culprit for this population decimation is a resurgence in demand for a particular kind of large fish, a critically endangered creature called the totoaba.People clamor for the totoaba's swim bladder, also known as maw. According to The New York Times, the fish's bladder -- which has been described as “aquatic cocaine” -- is considered a delicacy in China and Hong Kong. It can sell for as much as $10,000 a kilogram, or almost $5,000 a pound.Endemic to the Gulf of California, totoaba are captured illegally in Mexico’s waters before being smuggled across the border to California and shipped to Asia. Fishermen typically use gill nets to catch totoaba as well, which fatally entangle vaquitas.Under intense pressure from conservation groups, Mexico cracked down on totoaba fishing and began promoting vaquita conservation. Last year, the country imposed an emergency two-year ban on gill nets, both illegal and legal, across the vaquitas’ habitat. It also launched a $70 million plan to compensate impacted fishermen.The Mexican Navy, which is in charge of enforcement, has deployed new fast boats, planes, helicopters and even drones in an attempt to safeguard the area. Rafael Pacchiano Alamán, the secretary of the environment and natural resources, said the Navy recently increased its surveillance efforts, particularly at night.But while conservationists have lauded these efforts, three dead vaquitas were found in March, each entangled in gill nets likely set for totoaba. More than 40 illegal gill nets have been found this year so far. Frances Gulland of the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, California, who performed necropsies on two of the carcasses, said the animals were killed by “the lure of big money.” Experts are now calling for the Mexican government to make the gill net ban permanent, and to be more vigilant in the enforcement of the ban. Addressing totoaba demand and trafficking is also key. “As with elephants and ivory or rhinos and rhino horn, the relentless demand for the swim bladders of the rare fish in Asia almost guarantees that enforcement efforts in the field in Mexico, while vital, will remain insufficient,” environment writer Andrew Revkin wrote last year.Organizations like Greenpeace and the WWF have launched campaigns in an effort to raise awareness about totoaba trafficking. A petition by Greenpeace Asia to put pressure on Hong Kong authorities to crack down on the illegal trade has garnered more than 37,000 signatures. WWF is also pressing the U.S., China and Mexico to put an end to the smuggling of the fish. “In the end, if the vaquita goes extinct, the three countries will share the responsibility,” the conservation group said this week.

""They said we can be in Aleppo city because the regime of Assad said that we can go there, but Afrin, it is not possible for us to go there.""On Wednesday, Red Cross spokesperson Pawel Krzysiek told The Huffington Post his organization has been able to offer Afrin some support. The Red Cross was involved in a convoy carrying food and household essentials for 7,000 families into the Kurd-controlled area on March 13, and continues to donate to a bread project and clinic in the area run by its local partner, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, Krzysiek said. It has also previously helped provide residents with water by rehabilitating wells and donating water tanks and tap stands.The likely reason for the disconnect between the Kurdish official and the aid group is that all aid missions the Red Cross undertakes must be approved by the parties involved -- which in this case would include the Assad regime. The group has been able to provide regular, uninterrupted support to the region, Krzysiek said.But as Mohamed suggested, the regime retains the power to deny permissions for aid convoys by the Red Cross or other groups. It has been known to pressure the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to limit help to its opponents. And it has blocked humanitarian delivery in other areas, including on May 12 preventing a Red Cross convoy carrying medical supplies, vaccinations and baby milk from entering a desperate suburb of Damascus that the United Nations considers the neediest part of Syria. The regime shelled the area after sending the trucks away.Starvation sieges have become a favorite tactic of Assad and the forces supporting him, including Russian jets, Iranian troops and Iran-backed militia fighters from Lebanon, Afghanistan and elsewhere. The dictator is responsible for the vast majority of deaths in Syria -- far more than the so-called Islamic State -- and is the primary reason for the headline-grabbing refugee crisis.Syria's more than 3 million Kurds are in a precarious position. Though they have become darlings of the West because of their victories over the extremist Islamic State, or ISIS, they have tense relations with most other key players in Syria: the Assad regime and its supporters; the nationalist Arab groups fighting Assad with support from the U.S. and others; and the key international player in Syria, Turkey, which is battling its own Kurdish minority. The Afrin region is mostly surrounded by Turkey, which Mohamed said Tuesday has closed all border crossings. The Turkish government believes Kurds in Syria are supporting Kurdish militant groups in Turkey with whom they have historical and political ties.Other forces around Afrin's borders include Arab rebel groups, some of them Islamist organizations that Kurdish forces see as terrorists, and ISIS.But the Assad regime controls a significant border that is a potential path for supplies, and Mohamed suggested the dictator is the main factor preventing relief from reaching the area.Because of recent fighting in Aleppo, south of the region, thousands more refugees have fled to the besieged area this year, she said. ""We are welcoming all the refugees.""She estimated that about 300,000 refugees of various ethnicities now live there, in the homes of friendly locals, in rented housing or in tents in camps. Afrin's residents now subsist mostly off what they are able to grow themselves, Mohamed added, but they lack essentials like milk for babies.The Kurdish leader said she hopes the United Nations will begin to pay more attention to the plight of Afrin, which has been suffering even as other localities have received relief through ceasefires encouraged by the U.S. and Russia. But the international organization has its own troubles because of the Assad regime: It's been repeatedly accused of allowed the dictator's cronies to meddle in its operations, including earlier this year after the U.N.'s World Health Organization hired the wife of a top Assad associate.Mohamed is in Washington to meet with the Obama administration, who she said she's seeking more assistance from.Russia, an Assad patron and occasional partner of the Kurds, has offered little in the way of humanitarian help, she said.That fact and the regime's blocking of aid underscores the challenge to Russia's efforts to court the Kurds. As part of his attempt to show Russia is focused on ISIS and not just Assad, Russian President Vladimir Putin has helped the Kurds with airstrikes and diplomatic support, pushing for them to be included in international peace talks despite opposition from Turkey and Arab nationalist groups in Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov mentioned this support for Kurds in peace talks again Tuesday in Vienna at a joint appearance with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry -- underscoring for an international audience the contrast between the Kurds' two partners. Mohamed inaugurated an office for the dominant Kurdish political party, the PYD, in Moscow in February. But she and another Kurdish leader said Tuesday that the Kurds remain unwilling to work with Assad, Russia's best friend in Syria.Elham Ahmad, the co-president of the Syrian Democratic Council, noted that regime forces and their Iranian backers clashed with Kurdish forces last month. The council is the political arm of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the U.S.'s main partner on the ground in Syria. The forces are dominated by Kurds, but 40 percent of their members are Arabs, Ahmad said Tuesday.She mentioned that Iran, Assad's other chief supporter, has long suppressed its own Kurdish population. The statements are an important reminder of the Kurds' position to international observers, including many lawmakers and commentators in the U.S., who speak of the Kurds and the regime as the only forces battling ISIS in Syria. Even if Russia is willing to accept Kurdish control over some parts of Syria, Assad's officials and observers of his polices say the tyrant is set on retaking all of his war-torn country. This story has been updated to include comment from the Red Cross."

Jeb Bush hasn't been coy about the scars he bears from the Republican primary. He won't be voting for his bete noire, Donald Trump, in the general election (although he's not casting a ballot for Hillary Clinton either -- protests have ideological bounds, after all).But in one of his first interviews since leaving the race, the extent to which Bush sees the Republican Party as teetering toward irrelevance, and Trump as hastening that process, is made clearer. And it punctuates the sense of despair that is increasingly visible within certain panicky quarters of the GOP.It's ""uncertain,"" Bush told the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad, whether the Republican Party will survive as an institution. Bush spoke to the agency this past weekend ahead of a trip he is making to Amsterdam to deliver a lecture on democracy to the Nexus Institute on May 21. ""Parties no longer stand for anything, but become a vehicle for the ambitions of their leaders,"" he said. ""Politics becomes a personality show.""Like a batter tipping his hat to a pitcher who struck him out, Bush seems to reluctantly respect Trump's ability to excel at that personality show. But there is also resentment for the media's willingness to allow itself to be manipulated. ""Trump played by a different set of rules than anyone else,"" Bush says at one point. ""The press basically became his partner.""Bush's frustration is not just with the press corps. As bruising as the primary was for him personally, he also saw it as doing lasting damage to the party -- forcing it further away from the prescriptions it needs for long-term success. That so few other Republicans seemed to see this was genuinely befuddling for Bush as well. He brought up Trump's Cinco de Mayo tweet from earlier this month, where the business mogul sat behind his desk, praised the quality of the taco bowls at Trump Tower and declared his ""love"" of ""Hispanics.""""What Trump did was so insensitive,"" Bush told NRC. ""First, not all Hispanics are Mexican. Secondly, not all Hispanics eat tacos. Thirdly, showing your sensitivity by eating an American dish is the most insensitive thing you can do. Fourthly, to say this, next to all things he already said, is a further insult. It’s like eating a watermelon and saying ‘I love African-Americans.’""""This guy,"" Bush added. ""If we lose in November, we Republicans have ourselves to blame."" An English-language transcript of the interview was provided to The Huffington Post by NRC.

Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) has been leading the effort to get a third-party alternative to Donald Trump. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5739d2021600002900f93609.jpeg?cache=gcuepQyhJc&ops=crop_0_17_4333_2861%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Nebraska Republicans publicly distanced themselves from the #NeverTrump movement on Saturday, a rebuke to their home-state senator who has been leading the push to find a third-party candidate to challenge Donald Trump. Delegates at the state GOP convention overwhelmingly approved a resolution opposing Sen. Ben Sasse's (R-Neb.) push for a third-party challenge and confirmed they back the presumptive GOP nominee. ""If you support a third-party candidate, you are going to elect Hillary Clinton, and she is going to nominate the next three or four members of the U.S. Supreme Court,"" convention attendee Pat McPherson said, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The measure didn't specifically name Sasse, but it was clear that it was aimed at the freshman senator. Sasse was one of the first GOP politicians to say he would never back Trump, and has become one of the movement's most high-profile spokesmen. Republican officials exploring whether it would be possible to launch an independent bid against Trump have even been eyeing Sasse as a potential candidate. Sam Fischer, the nephew of Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), introduced the pro-Trump resolution. He told the Omaha World-Herald that his aunt had nothing to do with the resolution, and the senator herself sent Sasse a message Friday confirming her lack of involvement. Trump handily won the Nebraska GOP presidential primary last week. Delegates at the weekend convention also rejected a resolution condemning Trump for his ""degrading"" comments toward women and minorities. McPherson was the one who made the motion to put aside that resolution, according to the Guardian. The state school board member has been criticized for articles on his blog that refer to President Barack Obama as a ""half breed."" In 2003, McPherson also faced sexual harassment allegations.Supporters of an independent bid admit it's a long shot. But they've been exploring the idea of suing states over their deadlines for ballot access so they can be afforded more time to find a candidate. They're also looking at the possibility of starting a new political party rather than running with an existing one, an approach that could be easier to use to get onto ballots. Even if all that is accomplished, the movement still needs to find a strong candidate willing to run and convince skeptical Republicans that it's worth it. Sasse's spokesman declined to comment on Saturday's proceedings.This piece has been updated with additional information about the Nebraska GOP convention.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The goal of the coordinated coverage is to place the problem of homelessness front and center for residents and policymakers, driving politicians to take action.“We are all frustrated,” Jon Steinberg, editor in chief of San Francisco magazine, told the news outlet. “We are all fed up.

Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) in a fundraising appeal for Grayson's Senate opponent. ""I will be blunt. I want Alan Grayson to lose,"" Reid wrote in an email sent out Monday. In case anyone isn't clear about where Reid stands, the subject line of the email reads: ""I want Grayson to lose.""Grayson is competing for Florida's Democratic Senate nomination against Rep. Patrick Murphy, who is supported by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and much of the party establishment. The Senate seat is currently held by Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who has said he won't run for re-election.Grayson has been hounded by revelations that he manages hedge funds that use his name in the title, which many legal experts say violate congressional ethics rules designed to prevent lawmakers from profiting off their post. Two of those funds are based in the Cayman Islands. Grayson has changed the name of the hedge funds and said he isn't in violation of the rules because he has no ""fiduciary duty"" over the funds. Grayson confronted Reid over his support for Murphy at a Wednesday Congressional Progressive Caucus meeting. An aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the exchange to The Huffington Post: Grayson says, ‘Do you know who I am?’Grayson said he decided to stand up and challenge Reid last week -- much to the chagrin of some of his fellow CPC members -- because he wanted to know why Reid had put out a statement calling on him to drop out of the race and accusing him of unethically using his position to promote a hedge fund. He also wasn't sure Reid actually knew who he was. ""One question on my mind was, 'Did Harry Reid actually say this, or was this something that was manufactured by his staff?'"" Grayson said. Grayson added that he gave Reid several chances to put forward evidence to support his charge, but Reid simply told him he wanted him to lose. Reid's office responded that Reid took the opportunity ""to express his low opinion of Congressman Grayson to his face"" and said the reason he was accusing Grayson of ""running a Cayman Island hedge fund from his Congressional office in order to line his own pockets is because these things are true.""Reid's email: This piece has been updated with comment from Grayson.

Ruffalo and his nonprofit, Water Defense, have been warning Flint residents that their water might be unsafe for bathing. Virginia Tech civil engineering professor Marc Edwards says the data behind these warnings is bunk -- and that the warnings themselves might be hurting public health. ""I have moms calling me saying that because of this group they are not letting their children take baths or wash their hands,"" Edwards told The Huffington Post on Monday. Edwards says hand-washing and bathing fears probably contributed to a recent spike in gastrointestinal illness in and around Flint. The Genesee County Health Department last week advised residents to wash their hands to avoid getting sick.Flint residents have complained that their water causes rashes and hair loss since the water crisis began in April 2014, when the city started pumping water from the Flint River instead of continuing to purchase it from Detroit. Thanks to bad guidance from state regulators, Flint didn't treat the water to prevent it from corroding the city's pipes -- many of which are made from lead, a deadly neurotoxin. Edwards and a team from Virginia Tech sampled people's tap water last summer and confirmed dangerous amounts of lead were leaching from the pipes -- contrary to official assurances. The government only admitted its mistake after Flint pediatricians, led by Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, reported high lead levels in children's blood. Though the city has switched back to Detroit water and improved its treatment regimen, the water still has high lead levels and complaints about rashes have continued. So far, government scientists and independent experts like Edwards haven't figured out how the water could be causing skin problems. The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating the rash issue but has maintained the water is safe for bathing. Ruffalo and his group have been more doubtful, saying there are dangerous chemicals in samples taken from Flint bathrooms and water heaters. ""Where the problem really lies is not the EPA, nor the state of Michigan nor Dr. Mona, nor Marc Edwards can tell the people of Flint it's safe to bathe in that water,"" Ruffalo said on CNN earlier this month. Edwards counters that the chemicals present in people’s water heaters are highly regulated and Flint’s water at this point doesn’t have more of the chemicals than water in other cities.""The DANGEROUS CHEMICAL that Water Defense discovered and has been most concerned with? Chloroform. The same chemical that the EPA and water industry have been addressing for 40 years, and for which we now have standards via the total trihalomethane (TTHM) regulation,"" Edwards wrote in a Monday blog post, adding that the data show Flint's TTHM levels are good. Edwards has also tried to debunk Water Defense's claim that showering exposes people to the risk of inhaling aerosolized lead, which Edwards called unfounded. (However, it is certainly possible to inhale dry lead dust.) Before he started ripping the group on his blog, Edwards tried to get Water Defense to substantiate or retract its alarming statements last month in a series of emails with Scott Smith, Water Defense's chief technology officer and investigator. It didn't work. ""Water Defense came to Flint after a Federal Emergency was declared, and has exploited the fears of traumatized Flint residents, whose unfortunate prior experience taught them to carefully listen to views of outsiders who question authority,"" Edwards wrote Monday. ""Flint residents can be forgiven for thinking otherwise, but not everyone who challenges the claims of the EPA, CDC and State of Michigan are automatically correct.""Water Defense hasn't publicly responded to Edwards' criticism since he first trashed them in a May 7 blog post. Smith told HuffPost on Sunday the group would say something within 48 hours. UPDATE -- May 18: In a Wednesday statement, Water Defense didn't respond directly to Edwards' criticism but did affirm its initial warnings about disinfectant byproducts in Flint's water. ""Water Defense testing has found harmful chemicals in residences receiving Flint water,"" the statement said. ""Flint residents are being exposed to these chemicals through various exposure pathways other than drinking water, such as bathing, washing, laundry, irrigation, humidity and climate control.""The statement ignored Edwards' core criticism that Water Defense hasn't shown Flint's contaminant levels to be above average or different than what you'd find in other cities.David Reckhow, a civil engineering professor and water contaminant expert at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, reviewed Water Defense's results and didn't see cause for alarm. ""They're not out of the ordinary at all,"" Reckhow said. ""In fact, in many respects they're not finding as much as I see in the water in my own home."" Reckhow confirmed that he uses the shower at his home. "

""I needed to take some time to put myself in environments where I felt good.""The rapper has been living in Cape Town with his family in self-imposed exile to fulfill that need. However, he made headlines in January when South African authorities arrested him for possession of fraudulent documents and overstaying his visa. In the aftermath of the arrest, Bey created more ripples when he released a freestyle track called ""No More Parties in SA"" to express his bewilderment at being arrested and detained in South Africa. He also went on to announce that he’s retiring from music and film via his friend and fellow rapper, Kanye West.Hopefully, these latest incidents won’t become the legacy of one of hip-hop’s giants.While Bey has largely disappeared from the hip-hop game, his trailblazing story shouldn’t be swept under the carpet and trampled on by the appropriation politics of an increasingly popular radio-edit hip-pop that is stealing the glory of a truly inspired and meaningful art form.Bey has always been a controversial performer and artist; not one to shy away from using his creative platform to shine a light on social injustice. Many may have forgotten about his enduring political activism, which helped spark the Black Lives Matter movement that’s recently been set ablaze by the unjust killings of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown and others.Bey’s 2000 Hip Hop for Respect Project, organized with Talib Kweli, his partner in the Black Star rap duo, was a bold and vocal protest against the 1999 police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot at 41 times by four white police officers in New York City. A multitude of emcees featured on the EP, including Dead Prez, Rah Diggah and Pharoahe Monche. In the same year, Bey performed at a benefit concert for political activist and Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was on death row for killing an officer.In 2006, he infamously performed his song “Katrina Clap” outside New York's Radio City Music Hall, where the MTV Music Awards were being held. It was a pointed critique of what many African-Americans viewed as President George W. Bush’s limited aid to the predominantly black victims of Hurricane Katrina. Bey drew crowds, and that, in turn, got him arrested for not possessing the correct permits for the performance.The history of slavery, segregation and institutional racism goes to show that all are not equal before the law, and the need for the Black Lives Matter movement is a stark reminder that this remains true. Often, the only way to unravel unjust laws is to challenge them. ""My country is called Earth. This whole thing belongs to everyone that's on it,"" Bey said in the Beats with Dre interview.

Amazingly, the 4-foot-11 Little managed to have a successful career playing the double bass, an instrument that, at 6 feet 5 inches, towered over her.She told reporters the size of her instrument was one reason she chose to marry flautist Warren Little, her husband of 41 years.“’I must say that when I met Warren, I was very impressed that he played a small instrument, so he could carry my bass around!'” she said, according to the Washington Post.Her husband retired in 1992 and died in 2002.Little's dedication to the instrument even as she fought many physical setbacks, including multiple myeloma, as well as a broken shoulder, elbow and pelvis over the years.“It’s just mind-boggling,” says Timothy Cobb, the principal bassist with the New York Philharmonic told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “It takes a tremendous amount of physical power, frankly, and just brute force to play in a big orchestra.""""I have had friends who have made it into their 70s, but to be pumping it out in the orchestra is really something,” he said.No plans for a service honoring Little have been announced, but the ASO is waiting to see if Guinness World Records will officially honor her as the musician with the longest tenure with one orchestra, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constituion."

A discussion about the Iran nuclear deal, however, was included at the end:Trump has promised to abandon the Iran deal, while Hillary Clinton and all but a handful of Democrats have supported this treachery from start to finish.

Protesters are allowed to gather on the sidewalk in front of the courthouse but not on the plaza, which is considered part of the courthouse grounds and is reached by walking up several steps from the sidewalk.A Maryland man named Harold Hodge challenged the law after being arrested in 2011 for standing in the plaza with a 2-by-3-foot (60-by-90 cm) sign hanging from his neck stating, ""The U.S. Gov. Allows Police To Illegally Murder And Brutalize African Americans And Hispanic People.""Hodge was approached by a police officer who told him he was violating the law, issued him three warnings to leave, then handcuffed and arrested him when he refused, according to court papers.The law made it unlawful ""to parade, stand or move in processions or assemblages in the Supreme Court building or grounds"" or to ""display in the building and grounds a flag, banner or device designed or adapted to bring into public notice a party, organization or movement.""Hodge's suit said he wanted to ""engage in peaceful, non-disruptive political speech and expression"" and that the law violated his First Amendment rights.The appeals court ruling against Hodge was written by Judge Sri Srinivasan, who President Barack Obama considered nominating to the Supreme Court following the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia before picking the same appeals court's chief judge, Merrick Garland.Srinivasan wrote that the plaza is not a traditional public forum. The government ""can impose reasonable restrictions on speech as long as it refrains from suppressing particular viewpoints,"" Srinivasan wrote, adding that protesters can still make their voices heard from the sidewalk area.The appeals court reversed a 2013 ruling by U.S. District Judge Beryl Powell who wrote that the law was ""unreasonable, substantially overbroad and irreconcilable with the First Amendment.""(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley.

The monk who started the business, Father Richard Walz, reportedly learned how to make habanero pepper sauce while he was living in Belize. Walz brought habanero pepper seeds back to America in 2003, when he returned to the Arkansas River Valley monastery.The peppers thrived in Arkansas' climate and more than a decade later, the abbey ships both red and green versions of their sauce around the world. Monk Sauce comes in at about 250,000 heat units on the Scoville scale, a system of measurement used to compare the spiciness of chile peppers. In comparison, Tabasco's Habanero Sauce is about 7,000 Scoville Units. A video produced by Great Big Story shows Walz planting peppers on the abbey's grounds and creating his special sauce in its kitchens. The peppers are blended with vinegar, onions, carrots, garlic and salt before being poured into bottles.  ""Perhaps someone who is living a simple life needs to have something to spice it up,"" Walz said in the video.  Watch the video above to see how Monk sauce is created. "
