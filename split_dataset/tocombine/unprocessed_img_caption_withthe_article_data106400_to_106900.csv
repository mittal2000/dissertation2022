Juan Pablo Galavis and Nikki Ferrell are the latest ""Bachelor"" couple to call it quits, according to Us Weekly. The pair, who met on Season 18 of the hit ABC dating show, have unfollowed each other on Twitter, with Ferrell posting a cryptic message on Instagram Sunday, seemingly confirming the split. The Huffington Post has reached out to ABC for a statement and will update accordingly if and when one is received. Galavis caused quite the frenzy following his season of ""The Bachelor."" The Venezuelan soccer player and single dad became a villain after he dissed his ""runner-up,"" Clare Crawley, on the season finale before refusing to say he loved his final choice, Ferrell, during the ""After the Final Rose"" special. (As of September, he still hadn't told her he loved her.) Galavis also refused to follow ""Bachelor"" guidelines, opting out of post-finale press and announcing that he and Ferrell were ""done with this show"" following the ""ATFR"" in March 2014. ""I know culturally there was a huge problem there, a divide and language barrier,"" host Chris Harrison told HuffPost Live of the controversy surrounding Galavis. ""But, with that said, he knew what was going on. He knew the situation, he knew the show. He knew what he had signed up for because he had been a part of it before,"" he continued. ""He really wanted to control all of it, and you can't. On 'The Bachelor,' to be successful, you have to let go. It's a scary thing to do.""Galavis and Ferrell participated in the recent season of VH1's ""Couples Therapy,"" but it appears their sessions couldn't save their relationship. As Juan Pablo put it: Let's hope he follows his own advice. UPDATE: A spokesperson for ABC declined to comment on reports that Juan Pablo Galavis and Nikki Ferrell have split up."

Even though the boy tested negative for the virus, out of an abundance of caution, he won't be released from isolation until further tests corroborate this first one, the health department said. He will also undergo respiratory virus testing. Even before the test results, the health department's so-called ""disease detectives"" had already begun tracking down contacts of the boy to determine their risk for Ebola. New York City saw its first case of Ebola last week. Dr. Craig Spencer, who was working in Guinea with Doctors Without Borders, is currently being treated at Bellevue Hospital. He has received antiviral therapy and plasma therapy, in addition to the required supportive therapy, since testing positive for the virus Thursday. Spencer had been self-monitoring potential symptoms since returning from Guinea, and reported a fever of 100.3 degrees on Thursday. "

MeyerThey have been here before, the Giants are one win away from winning their third World Series in five years. But the road back to Kansas City won't be easy. San Francisco concluded the series at AT&T Park after a dominant performance from Madison Bumgarner who shutout the Royals 5-0. He went the distance and no one expected anything less than perfection from the southpaw.""This guy was on tonight,"" said Giants manager Bruce Bochy. ""He was strong all night. When this guy is on, it's fun to watch. He was hitting spots, had great stuff. I just felt like that's his game.""Bumgarner never disappoints, he was brilliant on the mound. He pitched a complete game surrendering no runs. Bumgarner has pitched at least 7.0 innings in each of his five postseason starts this season, becoming only the sixth pitcher in history to do so in at least five consecutive starts in a single postseason. ""The guy's phenomenal,"" Mike Moustakas said. ""He commanded all of his pitches and when you thought you knew something, he did the exact opposite. That's what makes him good right now. He was throwing his fastball in there for strikes and his slider was sweeping all the way across the zone.

Bumgarner's ERA of 0.31 in the World Series is the lowest in history for a pitcher with at least 25 IP. He tossed nine innings, yielded four hits and struck out eight. Bumgarner allowed a hit in four frames while San Francisco's defense backed him in preventing a runner past second base. ""I felt great,"" Bumgarner said. ""I've been feeling pretty good, and I've been able to work both sides of the plate. I'm just happy we won, that was a big game for us, being tied 2-2. Going back to Kansas City with two games, it's a whole lot better that we have to win one now instead of having to win two.""Brandon Crawford became the fourth Giants shortstop to record at least three RBI's in a World Series. The others were Alvin Dark (Game 1, 1951), Rich Aurilia (Game 5, 2002) and Edgar Reneteria (Game 2 and 5, 2010). Crawford drove in three runs with a RBI grounder in the second, a RBI single in the fourth and a RBI single in the eighth.

MeyerAn emotional Juan Perez collected himself after hearing the news that his close friend, Oscar Taveras was killed in an automobile accident in the Dominican Republic earlier today. Taveras was a outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals. Perez who pinch-ran for Travis Ishikawa in the sixth, hit a fly ball off the center-field wall that was inches away from a home run in the eighth. He drove in two runs on a RBI double. San Francisco got off to a great start when Pablo Sandoval leadoff the inning with a single followed by single from Hunter Pence. The Royals made a pitching change, Wade Davis replaced Kelvin Herrera and struck out Brandon Belt. But he gave up a hit to both Perez and Crawford extending the Giants lead 5-0. ""During the game, when I found out the news, it was a little hard because I was thinking too much about it,"" Perez said. ""[Joaquin] Arias came over and said 'Stay strong, we've got to win this game.' When I hit the ball and went to third, I looked to the sky and I was thinking about him."" San Francisco jumped on James Shields early, Pence leadoff the second with a single and Belt followed with a infield bunt. Crawford drove in Pence making it a 1-0 game. Sandoval leadoff the fourth with a single. Shields struck out the next two batters before Ishikawa singled putting two on with two outs. Crawford flew out to center fielder Jarrod Dyson who dropped the ball scoring in Sandoval for the 2-0 lead. ""We've got to walk a tightrope without a net,"" Kansas City manager Ned Yost said. ""But our guys aren't afraid of walking the tightrope without a net. We fall off and we're dead. But if we win Tuesday, nobody's got a net. It's going to be winner-take-all."""

Spanning 2.4 acres and sitting just 1,000 feet from the U.S. Capitol, the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial is a sacred reminder of the cost of freedom for our country, and, given that we are still engaged in conflicts overseas, the ongoing cost paid by those who defend our country and have paid the ""penultimate"" sacrifice.The star-shaped fountain with the eternal flame at its center represents our collective hope and perseverance over adversity. As a veteran with a spinal cord injury and president of Paralyzed Veterans of America, I can attest that veterans with disabilities do share hope and the ability to persevere.Every year thousands visit the Vietnam Wall, World War II Memorial, Arlington National Cemetery, and other hallowed sites to honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. But this memorial isn't for grieving; rather it's for celebrating the service of those who daily push wheelchairs, use artificial limbs, require a guide, or deal with ""invisible"" wounds, such as post-traumatic stress. I am so proud to see our military service recognized in such a beautiful and meaningful memorial. I believe this memorial will create awareness and help educate people and make it easier to engage with veterans who have disabilities.And to help them get back to work.Every October, the Department of Labor celebrates National Disability Employment Awareness Month. The campaign raises awareness about disability employment issues and celebrates the many and varied contributions of America's workers with disabilities. Its roots go back to 1945 when injured service members returned home from World War II and sought to rejoin the workforce.It is important to recognize the disparity that exists in employment for veterans with disabilities compared not only to the general population but to other veterans. Even as overall unemployment for veterans drops, the most underserved segment of the veterans population -- those who have suffered a catastrophic injury, face a rate of unemployment three to eight times higher, an unacceptable reality that is best recognized by simply looking around your workplace and noting the few veterans with severe disabilities, if any, working there.It wasn't so many years ago that I was a recently disabled veteran, a former Navy SEAL, facing myriad obstacles to a reintegrated life. Paralyzed Veterans of America was essentially my first employer after I had broken my neck during SEAL training parachuting accident in 1991, and I've served with the organization in many capacities since. Because we understand the unique employment challenges faced by veterans with severe disabilities, Paralyzed Veterans of America created Operation PAVE (Paving Access for Veterans Employment) to assist veterans, their families, and caregivers with job skills, educational resources, networking opportunities, and workplace accommodations.A couple of weeks ago representatives of Operation PAVE participated in an employment conference conducted by the US Chamber of Commerce Hiring Our Heroes program and Wounded Warrior Project. Many of our corporate partners in Operation PAVE participated. They recognize the positive attributes that veterans bring to a work force: drive, determination, responsibility, teamwork, mission focus. Why wouldn't you want to hire a vet? I challenge employers everywhere, large and small, private and public, to recruit, train, and hire veterans. When you are an active duty service member you are an asset; having a disability makes you no less so. Putting veterans with disabilities back to work enables them to continue to be contributing, productive members of society, and helps to educate others about service and sacrifice -- and that's healthy for a community as a whole."

If we learn to take a look at our own suffering in this life, whether it be suffering from isolation, inadequacy, failure, loss, or grief, we realize that they've all hurt like hell. If we open up, our hearts end up broken; but here we are anyway. I am sure some of us can see the way in which our suffering burns deep into us and creates a different quality of being, but it's still very hard to imagine a curriculum in which Suffering 102 is part of the coursework for becoming a fully realized human being. There is a tremendous fear of vulnerability to our human hearts. ""I can't bear it. I've got to look away."" Many of us first had this experience when we were very young, when we had our first love affair, our first intense attachment, and having it go awry which broke our hearts, and thinking, ""I'll never open my heart again; it's too painful."" Yet most of us, after awhile, after we grieved for our loss, something changed, and we were ready to start again. Many of us have opened our hearts many times, and had them broken many times, but we just keep growing and growing. Instead of looking at these heartbreaks as the failures of life, we learn to look at them as the natural process of life, it just takes that little flip of your consciousness. When I look back on the suffering in my life, I see it now as a gift. I would have never asked for it for a second, I hated it while it was happening and I protested as loudly as I could, but suffering happened anyway. Now, in retrospect I see the way in which it deepened my being immeasurably.There's an interesting distinction here that's important to point out: In the noble truths that the Buddha enunciated, he spoke about suffering being inherent for everyone as part of the natural way of things, and he refers to the end of suffering, pointing out that the cause of an individual's suffering has to do with the way in which their mind responds to certain phenomena. The example I usually use comes from when I was much younger when I had hair, and then I started to lose it, and in my mind I was still somebody who had hair, so I let the remainder of it grow long, and I wrapped it around my head, so I could be someone with hair. I was constantly aware of the way the wind was blowing; I was like Auguste Rodin's Thinker. I was always holding my hair in place; and I was suffering. I was suffering because my mind was holding onto a model of who I was that didn't exist any longer; and finally I let go. I just decided that 'I am'; and just because the car was a little worn around the edges - I would not self-identify with my aging body.I began to see that aging, like everything else in nature, is built into the system. When you pit yourself against the system, against the nature of things, against the way in which it all unfolds, that's where the real suffering exists. So suffering, as the Buddha pointed out, is directly correlated to the way the mind holds onto certain things that are disparate from the way something actually is. Knowing that, we can begin to understand the Buddha's Four Noble Truths; the way in which one can begin to let go of the clinging of mind by meditative practice, by drawing the awareness back from the identification of thoughts; and to appreciate the realization that every experience of suffering is an opportunity for growth.When you begin to understand Buddhist teachings about suffering, you can't use them to rationalize other people's suffering. You cannot say, ""Well, they're suffering because of their mind"" - which forces us to deal with an interesting paradox: You understand that for an awakened person, suffering is actually grace, because suffering shows you where the mind is caught, and in that sense, is an extremely useful gift. However, you can't walk up to someone who is suffering and say, ""It's a useful gift!"" You don't have a moral right to try to take away somebody else's suffering. What you can be, however, is a spacious environment for that person to let go of their suffering if they are ready, but it is not your right. If someone says, ""I am suffering and what I need is a new car,"" and you say, ""That won't satisfy you,"" or ""Take your desire for a new car and turn it into grace,"" it probably won't work. I think the best thing you can do is to relieve suffering in any way you can. For different people, suffering manifests in different ways; for one person its hunger, you give them food; for another person, you invite them to fast. The more you can appreciate the levels at which suffering is created, the more your awareness is extricated from identification with the finite time and space associated with your body and your personality, and the more your awareness permeates and is part of what is. Out of that quality of being arises compassion, because it's us suffering, it's the suffering in the universe, and just as if your body were suffering, you would do something about it. If your left hand were suffering, your right hand would pull it out of the fire or do something to help it, so you do what you can to relieve suffering, because it's no longer their suffering; it's no longer her suffering or his suffering; it's the suffering. It's no longer your compassion, it's the compassion; and you begin to see the dance of suffering and compassion, and you're just part of the dance. So you do what you can to develop the awareness to embrace the mystery of the universe, and to expand it to allow for the appreciation of the beauty of the laws of the universe. Those unified planes of consciousness balance out and give perspective to the plane of consciousness in which you are a separate entity, where your individual heart is breaking when you see suffering. It gives you a perspective that allows your heart to break open again and again.In the work that I do with people who are ill and dying, it has taken me quite a long time to understand how deeply I fall in love with each of these beings while spending time with them. Accompanying that quality of falling in love is the pain of the loss of the Beloved, and while there is the pain of the loss of the beloved, there is also the idea of being with that person independent of the loss. It's the idea of ""I'll miss your form, but our essences are always here.""I don't have a formula to keep your heart from breaking but I do have a formula to keep you from getting so caught in your broken heart that you end up bitter, cynical and closed off from life. I think the art form is to stay wide open and vulnerable in life, sitting with the mystery and awe and pain, just sitting with it all. If you want suffering all you need to do is read the newspaper, and watch what happens to your heart with each item: Famine, tribal war, rape, theft, exploitation; just sit and watch. To read a newspaper meditatively is a really interesting experience; to find spaciousness within yourself and then read the newspaper as these phenomena arise that are part of the human condition is truly fascinating. What the human condition is at any moment is greed, lust, fear, anger, and violence, it has all of that stuff; and it also has beauty, tenderness, care, joy, play. I'll tell you, if you think you can be happy by denying the pain and sadness in the world, that isn't true happiness. The cost of armoring your heart against reality is more costly than you may appreciate. I've found that in the wonderful catch phrase, ""Be here now"", which I've been growing into for the last several decades is that ""here now"" has within it a richness that is enough. When somebody says to me, ""Ram Dass, are you happy?"" I stop and think about it, look inside and I say, ""Yes, I'm happy."" Somebody else comes up and says, ""Ram Dass, are you sad?"" I think about it, ""Yes, I'm sad."" ""Ram Dass, are you hopeful?"" - ""Yes, I'm hopeful."" ""Ram Dass, is it hopeless?"" ""Yes, it's hopeless."" It's extraordinary. I mean, I realized in just honestly answering these questions that all of that stuff was present.Now imagine what heaviness there is when a moment in time contains everything; this exact moment encompasses people who are hungry; this moment has the richness and thickness of the broken heart, of joy, of the mother and father holding their new baby, of a rose in bloom, of the grief over the loss of a long-term partner; it has all of it, and it's thick. It's thick with living truth and to be a part of that is to really be a living spirit within nature.  There's a line in the Dao that says, ""Truth waits for eyes unclouded by longing."" When you wish something were different, you can't see what really is, so we must expand to keep embracing into ourselves. Instead of ""I'm this fragile little thing; keep away from me; I can't stand that; don't get near me; I don't want to deal with that suffering today; thank you; I've got to protect myself,"" versus, ""Ahhhh...ahhhh.""Many years ago, I took a nine-minute acid trip, and I turned into this huge woman; she was black; she was naked, sitting spread open, with great breasts; she was reaching out and drawing all of the children, all of the beings, who are all children, into herself; and she was gorging on them; I was gorging on them and the people I was with were running for a bucket, thinking I was about to vomit. But at the same moment, I was in absolute ecstasy and I realized it was the ecstasy of not turning myself off to the life around me, to all of eternity; and it scared the hell out of me because to bear the unbearable is to die. Who you are dies into the One; and you no longer have compassion, you become compassion.Learn more about by watching ""Cultivating Grace & Transforming Suffering"" film and webcast with Jack Kornfield.

You've got eau de Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.Scientists at the University of Bern in Switzerland recently discovered the comet's pungent scent by analyzing a mixture of molecules detected in the comet's coma, the cloud of particles and gases around the space rock's nucleus.The molecules were collected by an instrument aboard the Rosetta spacecraft, which has been flying in tandem with the comet. The instrument, called ROSINA, consists of two mass spectrometers and a pressure sensor.(Story continues below)Along with ammonia and formaldehyde, the molecules behind the comet's stench include hydrogen sulphide, hydrogen cyanide, methanol and sulphur dioxide, New Scientist reported.""What's surprising is we already have extremely rich chemistry at this distance from the sun,"" Kathrin Altwegg, a researcher at the university who runs the ROSINA instrument, told New Scientist.The icy comet is more than 400 million kilometers (about 250 million miles) from the sun, the researchers said in a written statement, so they weren't expecting to detect such a wide variety of molecules until the space rock neared the sun and warmed up.""This all makes a scientifically enormously interesting mixture in order to study the origin of our solar system material,"" Altwegg said in the statement.To learn even more about the comet, the Rosetta probe is scheduled to deploy its robotic lander, Philae, to the surface of the space rock on Nov. 12."

Obama has resisted Republican calls for a travel ban on advice from health officials who say such a measure would be counter-productive, in part because it would impede people going to help fight the epidemic.""For me the benefits of having first hand knowledge of what is happening in these countries gravely outweighs the almost nonexistent risk of actually traveling to these countries provided I take the proper precautions,"" Power told reporters before setting off.Nearly 5,000 people have died in the worst recorded outbreak of Ebola, the World Health Organization said on Saturday, out of more than 10,000 known cases. The epidemic is centered on Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, but there have been a scattering of cases in some other countries, including the United States. The virus is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids from an infected person, and is not transmitted by people who are not showing symptoms.Power said her role put her in a good position to press for more international action to combat the virus.""In visiting the three affected countries and getting a detailed grasp of the gaps I hope to use my knowledge of those gaps to shake the trees and really push other countries to do more,"" she said.Power will also visit the headquarters of the United Nations Ebola response mission (UNMEER) in Ghana, which is coordinating global efforts to stop Ebola.In the United States, concern about the spread of the disease flared anew after the fourth case of the virus was diagnosed: a doctor who was infected after working with Ebola patients in Guinea and who is being treated in New York.The states of New York, New Jersey and Illinois have announced that people arriving after contact with Ebola patients in West Africa would be quarantined for the 21 day incubation period of the disease. The Obama administration is also considering quarantining health workers returning to the United States.But critics say such measures could discourage health workers from traveling to help get the epidemic under control.The World Health Organization said so far 450 health care workers have been infected to date, 244 of whom have died. Those infected include one in Spain, the New York doctor, and two nurses in Dallas, who contracted Ebola after treating a Liberian man who fell ill while visiting Texas.

Christie, the New Jersey governor who seems a likely addition to the 2016 presidential primary roster, has been traveling the country doing what he's supposed to do as chairman of the Republican Governors Association: raising as much money and publicity as he can to help his party's incumbents and candidates ahead of the Nov. 4 elections. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8daf7200000f90101d45e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) on Sunday defended his abrupt Ebola quarantine policy, dismissing concerns that the aggressive treatment of health care workers would prevent American doctors from going overseas to combat the disease.""The government's job is to protect safety and health of our citizens,"" Christie said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I have no second thoughts about it.""Christie's policy, implemented in conjunction with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), runs well beyond what scientific professionals recommend. Anyone entering the U.S. through JFK or Newark airports who has had contact with Ebola patients will be subject to a 21-day quarantine -- the incubation period of the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared on several shows Sunday to warn that harsh treatment of health workers returning from Africa could backfire and jeopardize Americans.""If you put everyone in one basket, even people who are clearly no threat, then we have the problem of the disincentive of people that we need,"" Fauci told ABC. ""Let’s not forget the best way to stop this epidemic and protect America is to stop it in Africa, and you can really help stopping it in Africa if we have our people, our heroes, the health care workers, go there and help us to protect America.""Fauci's comments were echoed by Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.""All of us need to make clear what these health workers mean to us and how much we value their services, how much we value their contribution,"" Power said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""We need to make sure they are treated like conquering heroes.""Christie brushed off those concerns. ""Folks that … take that step and are willing to volunteer also understand it's in their interest and in public health interest [to be quarantined for three weeks],"" Christie said.Cuomo also defended the quarantine during a radio interview on Sunday, saying it was enforceable ""as a matter of law."" Kaci Hickox, a nurse who had volunteered with Doctors Without Borders to treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, said in an op-ed for the Dallas Morning News that she was treated like a ""criminal"" upon her return to the United States from West Africa. Hickox said she was detained for six hours in a process that seemed punitive and absent of medical expertise -- ""a frenzy of disorganization, fear and, most frightening, quarantine."" Hickox tested negative for Ebola when she was finally allowed to leave the airport for a hospital, where she is being quarantined for three weeks.""I sat alone in the isolation tent and thought of many colleagues who will return home to America and face the same ordeal,"" Hickox wrote. ""Will they be made to feel like criminals and prisoners?""A total of four U.S. patients have been diagnosed with Ebola since late September. The CDC confirmed on Sept. 30 that a man who had traveled from Liberia to Dallas had tested positive for the disease, and two nurses who treated him eventually tested positive as well amid widespread criticism of the hospital's protocols to protect its workers. Public health officials now believe that case to be contained. Another doctor who had treated Ebola patients in Guinea tested positive in New York City last week.Ebola can only be contracted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a person experiencing Ebola symptoms. While public health officials remain alarmed by the outbreak in West Africa, where resources, medical infrastructure and personnel are all in short supply, concerns for a major outbreak in the U.S. are much more muted.Christie said the quarantine arrangement was a necessary step to protect the public in densely populated areas, criticizing the federal Centers for Disease Control.""The fact of the matter is, CDC protocols … have been moving target,"" Christie said. Doctors Without Borders is a public health nonprofit that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999. The organization issued a press release criticizing Hickox's treatment, saying they are concerned about the conditions of her quarantine and the apparent lack of information on the terms of the Christie-Cuomo policy.“There is a notable lack of clarity about the new guidelines announced yesterday by state authorities in New York and New Jersey,” said Doctors Without Borders Executive Director Sophie Delaunay. The CDC has the authority to issue recommendations for public health issues like Ebola, and has not suggested quarantines. But state and local officials have the authority to impose more stringent standards if they see fit. A major nurses union has sustained criticism of the CDC's guidelines, calling them unclear."

Offices and bulletin boards, which once showed photo tributes to dead American and British soldiers, had been stripped.""It's eerily empty,"" said Lt. Will Davis, of the Queen's Dragoon Guards in the British Army. Camp Bastion was also where Prince Harry was based in 2012 as an Apache helicopter gunner.In all, 2,210 American soldiers and 453 British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, when the U.S.-led coalition toppled the Taliban government for harboring al Qaeda after the militant group carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.The coalition has been led by NATO since 2003, and includes forces from Germany, Italy, Jordan and Turkey.After Sunday's ceremony, the Afghan National Army's 215th Corps will be headquartered at the 28 sq km (11 sq mile) base, leaving almost no foreign military presence in Helmand.The U.S. military is leaving behind about $230 million worth of property and equipment -- including a major airstrip at the base, plus roads and buildings -- for the Afghan military.""We gave them the maps to the place. We gave them the keys,"" said Col. Doug Patterson, a Marine brigade commander in charge of logistics.Speaking on BBC television, British Defense Minister Michael Fallon said British armed forces had helped to strengthen the Afghan security forces, who were now taking on ""full responsibilities.""""It is with pride that we announce the end of UK combat operations in Helmand, having given Afghanistan the best possible chance of a stable future,"" he said. ""CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC""Helmand province, which produces 80-90 percent of the opium that helps finance the Taliban's insurgency, has seen fierce fighting this year, with Taliban and allied forces seeking to seize the district of Sangin from the Afghan army and police.The battles have raised concerns about whether Afghan forces are truly able to hold off the Taliban without intelligence and air support from the United States and its allies.Officials with the U.S.-led coalition say the Afghan forces, which have been losing hundreds of soldiers and policemen each month in battles, assassinations and suicide attacks by insurgents, did not lose any significant ground in the recent summer fighting season.""I'm cautiously optimistic they will be able to sustain themselves,"" said Brig. Gen Daniel Yoo, the commander of Regional Command (Southwest).He said the success of the Afghan security forces depended on leadership, continued development of logistics and confidence.""They've got to want it more than we do,"" he said.International forces in Afghanistan boosted their numbers to about 140,000 in 2010 troops with the aim of wresting control of Helmand back from the Taliban. By Jan. 1, that number will be about 12,500, comprising mostly trainers and advisers.Of those, 9,800 will be American, with the rest from other NATO members. The British will keep a small contingent at an officer training school in Kabul.Gen. John Campbell, head of coalition forces in Afghanistan, acknowledged Helmand ""has been a very, very tough area"" over the last several months.""But we feel very confident with the Afghan security forces as they continue to grow in their capacity,"" he said.He said that the smaller international force that will remain next year will still provide some intelligence and air support, two areas where Afghan forces are weak.General Sher Mohammad Karimi, chief of staff of the Afghan National Army, also said the insurgency ""will keep us busy for a while.""""We have to do more until we are fully successful and satisfied with the situations,"" he said.Civilian casualties in Afghanistan may reach an all-time high this year, with the United Nations reporting nearly 5,000 killed or wounded in the first half of 2014, most of them by the insurgency.Several Afghans at Sunday's ceremony expressed pride at taking over the base, mixed with sadness that the international forces with whom they have worked with for years are leaving for good.""We are going to miss our friends,"" said Afghan Brig. Gen. Nasim Sangin. ""But we will still be in touch by email."" (Writing by Raissa Kasolowsky; Editing by Michael Perry and Kevin Liffey)"
