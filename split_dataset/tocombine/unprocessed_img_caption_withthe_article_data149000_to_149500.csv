Even though I carried around three Raggedy Ann dolls -- Fannie, Crannie, and Nannie -- during my pigtail years, I didn't consider them to be my ""babies"" and I never fed them bottle, burped them or put them down for naps.Except I gave them little voices and pretended they called me mommy.And when cancer came a callin' when I was 11 and the white coats informed me that my chances of ever giving birth to a child were nil, I didn't really give it much thought.  Except I cried as I wrote in my little pink diary with the lock on it about how I was missing an ""over e"" and that meant I couldn't have a baby.Friends of mine started to have wee ones as early as high school and I still didn't daydream about having a child.Except I did and it was always a baby girl.When I married my first husband, we were both on board with never having little ones run around the house.Except we'd secretly talk about ""what if...""And in 2008, when my ob-gyn told me that I needed to let go of any thought of having children because it was definitely no longer an option, I was totally fine with the whole thing because, well, I never wanted to be a mom anyway.Except I cried all over again as I wrote in my grown-up moleskin journal with no lock on it about how my missing ovary meant that I was never, ever going to have a baby... for real this time.Yet, through it all, I carried around a dress. A size 6T circa 1980 Strawberry Shortcake printed pinafore. It had been mine and I held on to it knowing one day I'd... pass it on to a daughter of my own?*Sigh*This little dress traveled with me from Ohio to Utah. From Utah to Arizona. From Arizona to Oregon. From Oregon to New York. From New York, back to Ohio and then to Albuquerque, New Mexico where it's been for just over three years. This well-travelled dress has been hanging in my closet literally collecting dust.So, why keep it if I was never going to need it? But then...The white coats ended up being wrong. Very wrong.It was an unusually warm morning in March 2010 when I could just feel something had shifted inside me. So, I took one of those cute little blue box tests. It was positive for a baby, baby. My man and I couldn't have been happier.Except the very next day, I miscarried and I'd wager money that was my little girl -- you know, the one I said I never wanted. The one I had a name picked out for even thought I said I had no intention of being a mom? Yeah, I'm fairly certain Alma Olivia died that day.And so, I finally, really let go of the idea of ever becoming a mommy.Except the universe didn't let go and I gave birth to a gorgeous baby boy in February of 2011.My days are now filled with the laughter of a little one. Oh, the laughter. And oh, the rough and tumble of a little boy.Acenxion Russell really is the only one I'm going to have, because his birth was hard on this not-so-spring chickadee's body and there were complications and... and... and...There is still this dress. I know I could save it and put it on him when he's about 5 or so.Except I'm not sure he'd fancy or appreciate the throwback style.Who could love this dress as much as I do? Who would understand what this dress means to me? Who could rock this Strawberry Shortcake red like nobody's business?Except she'd bring it some new millennium flair.Then it hit me. This is one of the reasons why the universe gave me a best friend -- because she has a daughter who is just the right age and the right size to slip on the vintage pinafore and give it new life in all the ways I dreamed of ever since I was a little girl.So from Albuquerque to Fargo the dress went...I now have the best of both worlds.Except, I don't have to deal with a teenage dating daughter -- good luck, Melissa."

If you are in need of a late-summer or fall getaway idea, check out my top five favorite places to unwind and renew. 1. Walland, Tennessee. Head to Blackberry Farm, nestled in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. From plush feather beds to mouthwatering cuisine from their James Beard Award-winning chef to blissful treatments at the Farmhouse Spa, Blackberry has long been a favored spot to retreat from daily stressors. Romance blooms here, so expect lots of couples. Reconnect during one of many outdoor activity offerings, such as fly-fishing, clay shooting, horseback riding, kayaking, biking, or hiking. 2. British Virgin Islands. If you're looking for a pure slice of heaven in the BVI, then check out the ultimate in private retreats at Scrub Island. Only three years old, Scrub Island boasts 52 guest rooms and a handful of villas. You'll find wonderful cuisine, a lavish spa, and hands-down the prettiest beaches you have ever seen. There are no cars on the island, only thousands of stars in the sky. And though the island may feel a world away, getting there is as hassle-free as the resort; fly into Tortola, where Scrub Island is just a short 15-minute boat ride on the resort's private yacht. Water activities are plentiful here, including snorkeling, diving, kayaking, and a water trampoline for jumping. Head to one of three private beaches, where each offers something different. North Beach features a 1000-foot shoreline, beach chairs, a pool, and a beach bar. Beside the Marina, Pavilion Beach has watersports, Jacuzzi, and a restaurant. Kayak to my favorite one -- Honeymoon Beach -- for a private afternoon by the water.3. Northwest Florida. If you're a beach lover, head to the New Urbanist town of Rosemary Beach, located on the sparkling Gulf Coast. Park your car when you arrive, and you won't have to move it until you're ready to leave (which may be never). Casual eateries and unique boutiques dot the town's main artery, and all of the restaurants are dedicated to the town's Green living theme. You won't find any chains or franchises nearby, just chalky white sand and miles of serene blue-green water. Spend workout time on the fabulous tennis courts, or at the indoor lap pool and fitness room. If you can't get enough of the sun, bike, walk, or jog along the pristine paths lined with herb and butterfly gardens, park spaces, and sitting areas. Rental homes, cottages, and carriage houses are plentiful in this town where the New Orleans-meets West Indies-meets Caribbean architecture is king. 4. Texas Hill Country. If you like horses, you must experience the fantasy setting of Dos Brisas. From luxe accommodations to farm-to-fork dining and enough activities to satisfy an adventurous spirit, this resort is relaxation at its best. Complete with horse stables and Spanish-style haciendas, this 313-acre setting will take your breath away. Inside each of the 10 haciendas, you'll find 2,950-square-feet of space (bigger than my house!), leather duvets, Egyptian cotton sheets, fireplaces and the largest bathroom I have ever seen. French doors lead to your private screened porch, and a pool and outdoor Jacuzzi promise maximum serenity. Enjoy nature with daily activities that include fishing, skeet shooting, running, mountain biking, and even hunting excursions. Take a cooking or handcrafted cocktail class using handpicked ingredients from the inn's organic farm. In the evening, choose from the luxury bath salt menu and relax with your favorite book.5. Miami. Experience a memorable vacation in Miami at Canyon Ranch Hotel & Spa to refresh your spirit. Start off your day with a morning walk on the beach, or up the challenge and take on the two-story indoor climbing wall. Savor the sparkling pool, organic wines, and healthy gourmet cuisine here, make sure there's time to enjoy one of the largest spas in South Florida. Indoor offerings include boxing, stretch and meditation classes, cycling, Zumba, Kinesis, mind/body training, Pilates, and yoga. Outdoors, you can experience tennis, golf, kayaking, and even surfing. Feel free to sign up for a stress management or relationship-building class, get a couples massage, or simply relax along Miami's pretty coastline."

I will not pay my suffering forward. It stops with me.""(NOTE: Photos may be disturbing to readers.)After a workshop on compassion with Fred Luskin and Rick Hanson at CAL Berkeley in the autumn of 2009, I was inspired to try a new, more skillful solution: After 25 years of silence, I located the driver of the car (on Facebook, of all places) in which my body and face were smashed to pieces, and after an extremely lengthy and gut-wrenching dialogue about exactly what had transpired on the night of Jan. 6, 1985 was able to utter the words, ""I forgive you.""This did not mean that I condoned his behavior. This did not mean that I wanted to be friends with him. This meant I released my right to resent that the car accident happened.It meant that I was finally ready to ask for my freedom.You can't change the past, so any resentment, anything that your mind tells you should have been otherwise -- any shoulda-woulda-coulda-didn't, as I've stated in many other blogs -- is like ""drinking poison and waiting for the other person to get sick.""I had clung to my unskillful solutions for 25 years -- resentment, revenge fantasies, sucking other people into my drama, being addicted to my grievance story, victimhood, whinging and whining -- all of which were miraculously released by uttering three little words.I.Forgive.You.I will not pay my suffering forward; it stops with me.""We perseverate in bad choices and blame others for not trying new solutions,"" said Fred Luskin during a later lecture at Spirit Rock.Last winter during another workshop (little known fact, but personal growth classes, healing journeys, and transformational workshops are actually mandatory for California residents and if you fail to comply Jerry Brown personally asks you to vacate the state), there was a yet another crack in my consciousness -- ""That's where the light gets in,"" says Leonard Cohen -- and I was ready to try on another new, more skillful solution: ""I CHOOSE the scars on my face. I CHOOSE the scars on my leg -- just like I chose my tattoo,"" which in some subconscious way had been a symbolic reclamation of my body.""I am SUPPOSED to look like this. It is NECESSARY for me to have this discomfort."" Voila!""You either accept your life or change it. Any other position is insane,"" says Eckhart Tolle.The past is history; the only thing that remains is the narrative. And any part of the narrative that does not accept and embrace one's life or adds the judgement ""that should not have happened"" pulls one backward into a no-longer-existent past, hinders one from showing up authentically in the present, and places limits on one's not-yet-existent future.I mean, in the grand scheme of things, it's completely up to me if I walk around for the next 50 years whinging and whining, bitching and moaning about something I can't change... or muster up the balls for a little radical acceptance (thank you Tara Brach).Right?I may be dense, skeptical and fear-based.But every 25 years or so, there is a crack in my consciousness.That's where the freedom comes in.

The Oak Brook, Illinois-based company has announced that it will restructure its operations in four countries and close in three countries, shutting down approximately 175 underperforming restaurants in about 10 other countries and eliminating 400-600 positions to control costs and reallocate resources. McDonald's Corporation announced its first quarterly net loss ever January 23, 2003 in Oak Brook, Illinois. The $343.8 million loss for the last three months of 2002 shows the company's charges and write-offs. The fast-food chain said that it would close about 600 restaurants this year, including 400 traditional McDonald's. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d59961f0000510021943c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I first turned to McDonald's for comfort in 2004. I was studying in Rome and yes, the food was delicious. The pasta was toothsome, the olive oil spicy, the wine weighty and fragrant. It was so good, in fact, that Romans at the time wouldn't deign to recognize another cuisine as worthy of eating. When I wasn't in the mood to eat pasta for the 10th consecutive day, I'd find myself the only patron at 3 p.m. in a lonely Chinese restaurant near my Vatican-adjacent apartment, eating fried rice and almond chicken. It was the only restaurant I'd discovered that didn't serve Italian food.I started going to McDonald's for breakfast on my way to school in the Trastevere district. I found Roman breakfasts unexciting (I'd now swoon over cured meat and crusty bread for a morning meal but my 20-year-old self wasn't so wise) and thought that one of those hot, handheld apple pies might just hit the spot. Then I'd venture in for the occasional Happy Meal when the desire for American fare struck. I know about pink slime and I eat at farm-to-table restaurants and I stop at the farmer's market on my walk home to fetch fresh eggs and asparagus for dinner. But I'm not going to tell you a Chicken McNugget doesn't taste good. It does. It tastes really, really good.In my subsequent travels, the occasional trip to McDonald's while abroad has not only been a way to find some familiar flavors in a strange land. It's also served as the most surprising way to do just the opposite. These menus can reflect the local tastes in an even starker way than a night market or street vendor might. I remember eagerly entering one outpost in a remote part of Indonesia after three months of backpacking, salivating at the thought of Big Macs and fries and anything that wasn't nasi goreng, the fried rice dish I'd been subsisting on for weeks. Of course, there was a version of the Indonesian staple on the menu.In Colombia, Egg McMuffins shared the breakfast menu with cheesy corn arepas. In Australia, biscuits came with vegemite as well as jam. Hong Kong peddled teriyaki bowls, sesame miso dipping sauce, kumquat green tea punch and a sandwich of boneless chicken thighs and five spice powder -- plus a breakfast platter of hot dog and baked egg over a pile of 'twisty pasta', an odd mealtime mash up that didn't seem American or Asian in provenance. Sometimes a visit to McDonald's reminds me of home and other times it reminds me of just how far away I am.I haven't been back to Rome since college, but a glance at McDonald's online menu for the country shows that those stubborn Italian tastes have since infiltrated my little oasis of Americanism. Now on offer next to my beloved nuggets? Mortadella on focaccia, spinach and Parmesan croquettes, pasta with tuna and capers and, to finish it off, a pistachio McFlurry."
