France is your country,"" Hollande said in a speech to mark 70 years of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp.After an Islamist gunman killed four people in a Jewish supermarket in Paris this month, Netanyahu said he wanted to increase Jewish immigration from France and other European countries where he said there was ""terrible anti-Semitism.""Speaking at the Paris Shoah memorial to French Jews who died at Auschwitz and elsewhere during World War Two, Hollande said France would remain a welcoming home for its Jewish population.""I want to say that France will protect all its children and will tolerate no insult, no outrage, no desecration,"" he said.France has the biggest Jewish community in Europe -- around 550,000 -- a population that has grown by about half since World War Two.But figures published by the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF) on Tuesday showed the number of anti-Semitic acts in France had doubled last year to 851, 241 of which were violent.Some 7,000 Jews left France for Israel last year, more than twice as many as in 2013 and the largest number since Israel's birth in 1948, CRIF said.

A ruling is expected by the end of June.CBO expects 12 million people to enroll in private coverage this year and 21 million in 2016, vs. an earlier forecast of 13 million and 24 million, respectively.CBO also expects private enrollment to fluctuate between 24 million and 25 million people each year beginning in 2017, fewer than the previous forecast that called for enrollment to stay steady at 25 million.Even with slower enrollment in private insurance, CBO said higher-than-expected enrollment in the Medicaid program for the poor would help Obamacare reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 19 million this year and by 24 million to 27 million people each year from 2016 onwards.Medicaid would cost the federal government $59 billion more than expected over the next 10 years as a result of higher enrollment under Obamacare, CBO said.

On Jan. 28, 2015, the Senate Judiciary Committee opens two days of hearings to consider President Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch to be Attorney General (AG) of the United States. She would be the chief law enforcer for the United States. Currently, she is the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. In this New York office, she brokered what's called a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with HSBC, one of the world's largest banks. HSBC admitted to massive criminal money laundering. Rather than indict the firm or any individuals, the DPA required HSBC to pay a fine -- $1.9 billion, or roughly a month's profit. Sen. Charles Grassley (D-Iowa), who will chair the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, asked current AG Eric Holder why the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) didn't bring criminal charges against HSBC in a hearing two years ago. Holder responded that some firms are just too big. Here are some questions that senators should ask to make sure that size no longer shields a company from the rule of law.· Some cite the government's criminal case against the Enron accounting firm Arthur Andersen, which subsequently closed its doors, as a reason to avoid bringing a criminal case against any major company. Some contend that filing a criminal charge against a large bank isn't fair since the criminal activity may be limited to only a portion of the bank, or that it is difficult to make sure that all the rules are obliged when a bank is so large. Do you sympathize with thes arguments? If a bank is so large that it's impossible to ensure that all the laws are followed, should we break it up? · Even when the DOJ has brought criminal cases, there seems to be little real punishment. Business continues. Executives remain in their jobs. Bonuses are paid. The JP Morgan board doubled CEO Jamie Dimon's pay because of the massive legal settlements. Do you think the DOJ is doing its job if banks commit massive violations, but no individuals seem to suffer penalties? · When the government has brought cases against smaller banks, such as Riggs Bank, the end result is that the banking business is taken over by another bank. PNC took over the Riggs operations. HSBC's American operations result from its acquisition of Marine Midland Bank and Republic National Bank. Couldn't a DOJ criminal case simply lead to the sale of its American banking business to another owner? · HSBC's money laundering violations are huge. The bank failed to report $200 trillion worth of transactions. It laundered $881 million for drug cartels, changing its teller windows to fit the pre-fabricated boxes of cash from the narco-traffickers. It laundered money for despots and terrorists. It laundered money even after regulators caught and scolded them for it. Apparently, however, this activity wasn't sufficient for the DOJ to bring a criminal case. Do you think the failure to bring a criminal case compromises deterrence? Would other firms see that major money laundering violations will only result in a fine? · Despite massive crimes committed by all the mega-banks leading to the 2008 financial crash, the DOJ has brought no criminal case, nor has it charged any senior executive. Can you comment on these theories:a. The DOJ is out-lawyered by the mega-banks who retain DOJ alumni;b. The DOJ misunderstands the law, as Judge Jed Rakoff claims;c. The DOJ considers that the odds of a settlement (deferred prosecution agreement) are far better than risking a trial. · AG Holder explained to Sen. Grassley that the DOJ did not consult experts outside the government as they weighed a prosecution and/or penalties for HSBC. It has been reported that HSBC did make a case that a prosecution would lead to global financial tremors. Should the DOJ report to Congress on the analysis it does when it settles a major financial crime case short of a criminal prosecution? Should the DOJ enjoy the sole discretion on whether to choose a private settlement over a public trial with a mega-bank, given that the victims of a massive crime may be numerous? · In defending its DPA settlement with HSBC, assistant attorney general Lanny Breuer said there was a ""sword of Damocles"" hanging over the bank. Said Breuer, ""HSBC is paying a heavy price for its conduct and, under the terms of today's agreement, if the bank fails to comply with this agreement in any way -- any way at all -- we of course, the government, reserve the right to prosecute the bank."" As you know, HSBC has subsequently paid fines for foreign exchange manipulation and other violations. HSBC has been charged with tax fraud in Belgium and France, and with aiding tax evasion in Argentina. On Jan. 20 the DOJ received a report from the HSBC independent monitor. News reports say it contains information about further problems. Can you provide this monitor report to us now as we consider your nomination? Further, the DOJ has issued a summons to HSBC related to an investigation of a firm that may help clients escape income taxes. Its website is offshore-protection.com. The DOJ says it requested information from HSBC about people who ""who may be evading or have evaded federal taxes."" Since HSBC is supposed to know its clients and why they use HSBC, HSBC should have declined any relationship with a firm that the government officially and publicly believes may be helping people evade taxes. Since the DPA authorizes the DOJ to decide when there is a crime, will you now take this opportunity to void the DPA and file criminal charges against HSBC and HSBC executives?· In the last two years the DOJ reached civil settlements with all the major U.S. banks for numerous, massive frauds. In each case, however, the firms paid the fines, which are effectively funded by shareholders, not the individuals responsible for the infractions. Should individuals pay fines? Several bank regulators claim a culture of crime infects Wall Street. Martin Wheatley, the UK's chief bank crime regulator, recently observed that when an industry attracts workers who essentially want to make money, the ethical challenge is ""built in."" A Dodd-Frank section (956) provides that banker pay can be reformed so that pay can be deferred and used to pay fines. New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley has proposed that banks fund an account from deferred pay for senior executives. As the nation's senior legal advisor, do you support this idea?

Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) is seeking to attach an amendment to legislation authorizing construction of the pipeline that would throw out federal protections for the lesser prairie chicken, a bird native to Midwestern prairies.The Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service listed the bird as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in March, citing the ""rapid and severe decline"" of lesser prairie chicken populations. Protections for ""threatened"" species are not as strict as those for ""endangered"" species, but the service said the listing recognizes that the bird is ""likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable future.""Moran said in a statement that the listing is ""yet another example of unnecessary intrusion into private lives and businesses by the federal government."" He said the listing is hurting farmers, ranchers, oil and gas development, transportation, and wind farms. ""I am confident there are ways to conserve the species without hindering economic development in rural communities,"" Moran said. ""Listing the bird as a threatened species is not the answer.""The lesser prairie chicken is the latest member of the grouse family to face congressional scrutiny. In December, a provision included in the omnibus spending bill barred the Interior Department from moving forward on proposing Endangered Species Act protections for the greater sage-grouse, and from finalizing those protections for the Gunnison sage-grouse, which the department has listed as threatened.The League of Conservation Voters called the Moran amendment ""egregious"" in a letter to senators urging them to vote against it, describing it as ""congressional meddling in science-based decision making.""The American Energy Alliance, a group linked to one of the Koch brothers, put out a statement Monday, saying the alliance would treat the amendment as a ""key vote,"" to be included in its annual energy scorecard rating of lawmakers. ""'Yes' is the pro-wildlife, pro-energy, pro-private property, and pro-human flourishing vote,"" the group wrote. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has been leading the Senate floor debate on the Keystone bill, indicated Tuesday evening that votes on the Moran amendment and others are likely on Wednesday.UPDATE: Jan. 28, 4:36 p.m. -- The Senate voted on the Moran measure Wednesday afternoon. A majority of 54 senators -- all the Republicans present and one Democrat, Joe Manchin (W.Va.) -- voted in favor of the measure, but the amendment did not get the 60 votes it needed to pass. "

The entire Senate Democratic caucus signed a letter Tuesday afternoon to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) expressing support for Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called for a ""clean"" bill to fund DHS -- meaning one that has no riders attached, including the legislation approved earlier this month in the House. ""The House bill cannot pass the Senate,"" Democrats wrote in the letter, which was first reported by Politico. ""Democratic Leader Harry Reid has called for a clean funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. The President has also made clear that he will veto any bill that expressly limits his authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion on immigration matters. While we agree our current immigration system needs comprehensive reform, including border security enhancements, this appropriations bill is not the place for this debate.""In December, Congress approved funding through the end of the fiscal year for every department except DHS, which was funded only until the end of February. That decision was made because Republicans hoped to use the DHS bill to block policies advanced by the president that could allow up to 5 million undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. temporarily and work legally. Republicans say the executive actions were unconstitutional and an overreach of Obama's authority. The House's DHS funding bill passed on Jan. 14, and McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that the Senate will take it up when they finish work on legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline. He said they aim to finish on Keystone this week. Although Republicans have a majority in the Senate, they would need six Democrats to join them in supporting the bill to get the 60 votes needed to move forward. Even if the bill did pass the Senate, Obama has said he would veto it, and there do not appear to be enough votes in either chamber to override a veto. Speaking at a press conference Tuesday morning, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) declined to say what the House would do if the Senate did not pass its DHS funding bill. ""There's no reason for me to speculate about what we will or won't do,"" said Boehner. ""At this point, it's up to the Senate to act, and I expect that they will soon."""

Eighty percent of college students report feeling frequently stressed, and one in 10 have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression or other mental disorders. Like the rest of the country, universities are fraught with busyness and competing distractions. Students rush around, faces buried in smart phones and heads cluttered with things to do.  Given this grim reality of college life, it's too bad the Islamic call to prayer won't be proclaimed from Duke University's bell tower. The adhan can be an antidote to some of the challenges college students face.  Since Duke's decision last week to not broadcast the call to prayer from its chapel steeple -- prompted by Islamophobic rhetoric and threats against Duke's Muslim community -- the national discussion around the incident has centered around questions of pluralism and religion in the public space. But what was missed in those debates was the meaning and purpose of the adhan: encouraging deeper mindfulness among those who hear it.The adhan, like the ringing of church bells, calls us to gratitude, appreciation and attentiveness--things that the modern American university desperately needs. This kind of practice is especially suited to universities with a religious heritage or mission -- like Duke or my alma mater, Georgetown -- where the balance between rigor and reflection is encouraged, but often hard to strike. Religious and non-religious students alike have much to gain from being called from the chaos of their days to remember the greater purpose and meaning of their lives.  A Catholic in a Muslim land: When I lived abroad in Amman, Jordan during and after college, the adhan was a familiar part of my daily life. Five times a day, the rolling syllables of Allahu akbar -- Arabic for ""God is greater"" -- echoed across the city. Chanted from tall minarets and amplified by loud speakers, the adhan bounced off stone buildings and reminded Muslims to pray wherever they were -- at home, at work, at school or even at the mall. Sometimes, when I'd visit my local produce shop, I'd find the owner praying outside, his rug unrolled on the sidewalk and his body bowing in humble prostration.  The adhan became something that I, as a Catholic, grew to deeply appreciate and enjoy. Countless times, the words ""Come to prayer, Come to well-being,"" prompted me to step back from my day and remember what was most important.  I remember one of my first nights in Amman, when I climbed into the backseat of a cab, laden with my heavy backpack and the stress of adjusting to a new city. My mind was full of questions and doubts about whether Amman could ever feel like home. As we sped down the streets of Amman as sunset fell, the adhan came on the radio, and immediately a feeling of calm settled over me. The lyrical words drew me out of my anxiety and calmed my racing mind.  In the months that followed, the adhan continued to remind me to praise and thank God for the blessings of the day, and to ask for God's help in facing the challenges that would inevitably come my way while living in Jordan. It made me more attentive to the world around me -- the beauty of the pink sky at maghrib, the white flowers on the jasmine trees and the kindness of those I met.  A good habit for all:  Colleges could benefit from being prompted to mindfulness. Deeper awareness and thankfulness are necessities for today's campuses, where stress and strain run rampant.  My Muslim friends at Georgetown described to me the benefits of being called to pray, not just once on Fridays, but five times a day. Alerted by their watch, phone alarm or intuition, they'd get up from studying or hanging out with friends to pray. Being called out of their daily activities helped them cope and keep perspective when they were over-worked or concerned about grades.  That's why the adhan can be good for everyone -- even for those who aren't Muslim, and for those who don't believe in God. For most people, something is ""greater,"" whether they choose to call it God or not. The adhan can help us recall what gives our lives meaning, and can help us cultivate an attitude of gratefulness. It can help us look up from the cellphone in our hand and notice the blue sky, the purple shadows stretching across the snow or the smiles of those we pass by.  I don't anticipate that many universities will choose to adopt the adhan on their campuses anytime soon. But, that doesn't mean that students and others can't begin habits that yield the same results. Many campuses have bell towers, which ring on the hour or other specified times of day.

They should also compel us to attend to the things that are akbar -- the deeper needs of our soul. Downtown Amman, Jordan at sunset. Watch a video of the call to prayer here."
