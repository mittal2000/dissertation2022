As long time Kate Middleton advocates, we have adopted a ""Kate-can-do-no-wrong"" mentality, specifically when it comes to her stylish wardrobe. The Queen, on the other hand, seems to feel differently. The Mail reported Sunday that Kate Middleton is set to undergo a ""subtle but significant regal makeover"" for an upcoming trip to Australia this spring. The makeover will be a big change from those $72 dresses we love so much. The wardrobe overhaul comes with direct support from Queen Elizabeth II, who has commissioned her own personal dresser, Angela Kelly, to work with Kate's stylists on a brand new look. Designs by Alexander McQueen and Alice Temperley have already been in the works for gowns and dresses.   Additionally, Kate will be encouraged to wear the Queen's favorite tiaras (no biggie), along with some of her other most beloved jewels to aide in her regal image. Her majesty is not the only person close to Kate to critique her clothing. In fact, just last year, her friend encouraged her to start dressing a bit more ""quirky."" Sounds like there are some conflicting views on her royal closet. But one thing is certain, Kate will look flawless no matter what she wears. Her most royal fashion moments:Want more?

'Ye's supposed campaign, which include accusations of him causing all kinds of havoc, including bashing Lena Dunham and using photos of baby North as bait, it has become hard to tell what's true and what is just being used to stir the pot.What we do know is that everyone has an opinion about Kim K. potentially receiving one of the highest honors that exist in the fashion world. Fans (and some non-fans) took to Twitter Monday to express their excitement (and) disappointment in the potential shoot. One user even tweeted that the rumor must be ""a sign of the apocalypse."" The report, which Jezebel credits to a ""well-placed source,"" claimed Kim was being photographed in Los Angeles Sunday night, however, US Weekly reported Monday that the rumor is false. Neither Kim nor Vogue has made an official statement, but we're going to go ahead and guess that for now, it's not happening. We wouldn't be surprised to eventually see the curvy reality queen land the prestigious cover, though. We'll all just have to wait (with bated breath!) to find out. In the meantime, we can debate more important things, like whether or not Kim should have dyed her hair back to brown.The very stylish couple:Want more?

The glamorous, aristocratic lifestyle, the formal and luxurious interior design. I worked with Vi from Tastemaker to create an interior design inspired by Downton Abbey. Our goal was to pull some of the historical decorative elements, but to reimagine them for a contemporary setting. The last thing we wanted was to create a space that felt dated, which was a weighty task when working with such a distinct style. So here is is, our downtown chic version of Downton Abbey:My favorite part of this design is the wallpaper. Inspired by the library in Downton Abbey, we wanted to recreate the studious atmosphere, but honestly who has that many books? In a flash of brilliance, Vi remembered one of our favorite wallpapers: Wall of Books from Kathy Kuo Home. This wallpaper brilliantly captures the elevated and stately feel of the Downton Abbey library and sets the tone for our modern space.The sofa, from Jayson Home, alludes to Downtown Abbey's red, arched back couch, but is a bit more modern in color and form. For accent seating, we pulled the Natural Herald Chair from World Market. The delicate neoclassical design pays homage to many of the pieces in the Downton Abbey interior without looking like it came straight from the set. Its natural linen upholstery and wider, shorter shape bring this chair into the 21st century. And for a piece that can double as both seating and a coffee table, we chose the Kenan Ottoman from AllModern. The rich wine shade adds warmth and color to the room, while the deep tufting creates a feeling of opulence.For larger accent pieces, we layered up the luxurious feel in the space, by choosing gold toned pieces. After all, what's more luxurious than gold? To create a focal point and break up the wallpaper, we added a large, carved mirror. The delicate shape and curvy form mimics the French feel of the Downton Abbey drawing room without going overboard. We paired this golden wonder with the Arteriors Waldo lamp, which stands tall and anchors the sofa. On the opposite end, we placed a black and gold side table -- the perfect place to rest a cocktail. The Global Views table from Horchow is reminiscent of a tiered, Victorian side table, but much more glamorous and modern. One of the most difficult pieces to pick out in this design was the rug. We struggled to find a carpet that didn't overpower the space or scream grandma's house. In the end, we chose the Sea Blue Safavieh rug from Overstock.com. The cool tones of the rug help balance the room. It's completely modern, but the nubby texture and subtle Ikat pattern conjure up visions of antique carpets without dating the space.And of course, one of our favorite accessories: throw pillows! We used these four pillows to tie together our accent colors and introduce a few more patterns and textures. Each one has an antique element -- ruffles, floral print, lace -- that is reimagined for a contemporary setting. Clockwise from top left: HD Buttercup, Anthropologie, SenayStudio on Etsy, Anthroplogie. Overall, we've created a modern interior design that alludes to a luxurious past without feeling old or dated. How'd we do it? It's all about looking at the nuances of a space and pulling out a few key decorative elements in order to create similar ambiance. Is there an interior design you'd like to see us recreate for modern living? Let us know."
3,WELLNESS,Foolproof Formula: Think Less + Feel More = Less Stress,"Eckhart Tolle, Contributor
Spiritual teacher, author of ""The Power of Now"" and ""A New Earth""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/think-less-feel-more_us_5b9dd2ebe4b03a1dcc8d58af,"The realm of consciousness is much vaster than thought can grasp. When you no longer believe everything you think, you step out of thought and see clearly that the thinker is not who you are.",2014-02-03,2014-01-28-AnaPereira2grafpointgmail_com2-thumb.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-01-28-AnaPereira2grafpointgmail_com2-thumb.jpg,"The thinking mind is a useful and powerful tool, but it is also very limiting when it takes over your life completely, when you don't realize that it is only a small aspect of the consciousness that you are. Here is a new spiritual practice for you: Don't take your thoughts too seriously.The stream of thinking has enormous momentum that can easily drag you along with it. Every thought pretends that it matters so much. It wants to draw your attention in completely. The mind is incessantly looking not only for food for thought; it is looking for food for its identity, its sense of self. This is how the ego comes into existence and continuously re-creates itself. The egoic self is always engaged in seeking. It is seeking more of this or that to add to itself, to make itself feel more complete. This explains the ego's compulsive preoccupation with future. The mind exists in a state of ""not enough"" and so is always greedy for more. When you are identiﬁed with mind, you get bored and restless very easily. Boredom means the mind is hungry for more stimulus, more food for thought, and its hunger is not being satisﬁed. When you feel bored, you can satisfy the mind's hunger by picking up a magazine, making a phone call, switching on the TV, surﬁng the Web, going shopping, or -- and this is not uncommon -- transferring the mental sense of lack and its need for more to the body and satisfy it briefly by ingesting more food. Or you can stay bored and restless and observe what it feels like to be bored and restless. As you bring awareness to the feeling, there is suddenly some space and stillness around it, as it were. A little at ﬁrst, but as the sense of inner space grows, the feeling of boredom will begin to diminish in intensity and signiﬁcance. So, even boredom can teach you who you are and who you are not. The realm of consciousness is much vaster than thought can grasp. When you no longer believe everything you think, you step out of thought and see clearly that the thinker is not who you are.How easy it is for people to become trapped in their conceptual prisons. The human mind, in its desire to know, understand, and control, mistakes its opinions and viewpoints for the truth. It says: This is how it is. You have to be larger than thought to realize that however you interpret ""your life"" or someone else's life or behavior, however you judge any situation, it is no more than a viewpoint, one of many possible perspectives. It is no more than a bundle of thoughts. But reality is one uniﬁed whole, in which all things are interwoven, where nothing exists in and by itself. Thinking fragments reality -- it cuts it up into conceptual bits and pieces. Whenever you are immersed in compulsive thinking, you are avoiding what is. You don't want to be where you are. Here, now.Your unhappiness ultimately arises not from the circumstances of your life but from the conditioning of your mind.-- Eckhart Tolle, Stillness SpeaksFor more from Eckhart Tolle, please click here."

If it gets really cold (and the forecast predicts a high of 29 degrees in the evening), players are often presented with chicken broth in the locker room, he says. Grandma's favorite cold remedy helps replenish not just fluids, but also salt, he says, since the players will still be sweating (somehow!) despite the frigid temps.A bowl of broth is likely to be the only change to a player's diet during the big game, according to Matava. ""Food is one of those things they want to keep as stable as they can from day to day and week to week,"" he says. ""They really don't want to get out of their ordinary routine."" That includes hitting the hay at around the same time as usual in their hotel rooms and eating their usual gametime snacks (like protein bars, nuts and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, he says).Of course, with their sky-high caloric needs, football players eat a lot, but Matava says just like awareness of the dangers of the sport has increased, so too has the awareness of the importance of nutrition. ""It's taken very seriously,"" he says, even during the off season.That doesn't mean the occasional fast food run has been completely wiped out. ""Fried chicken is a staple,"" says Matava, but players who enjoy the once-in-a-while treat at least don't eat it on game day, he says. Everything in moderation, we say."
