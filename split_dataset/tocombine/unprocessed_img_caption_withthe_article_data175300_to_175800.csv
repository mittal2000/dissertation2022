If you grew up obsessed with it -- postgame pizza, movie pizza, baby-sitting pizza, college pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza! -- and followed that American passion for cheese, sauce, and bread with an adult pursuit of the best slice, the finest pie, the Platonic Neapolitan, then the idea of naming America's best is likely contentious.Photo Credit: © ChrisThompson.Click here to see America's 35 Best Pizzas""A best pizza list? I know pizza. That's not great pizza!"" Yes, pizza is tough to rank responsibly. Consider that just years ago, The New York Times' then critic Sam Sifton said Motorino ""serves the city's best pizza."" It was enough to make you roll your eyes and call him out for knowing better, right? City's best? Not its best artisanal or Neapolitan pie? What about its best slice? And what is a ""best"" slice or pie anyway? After all, you could argue that great pizza can be many different things.Click here to see Where to Get Drunk On Your FoodGiven America's current love affair for Neapolitan pies, some might argue great pizza must meet the requirements of the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana, the international nonprofit founded in the 1980s by a group of pizzaiolos to cultivate and protect the art of making Neapolitan pizza. Their rules? Fresh tomatoes as long as they're San Marzano dell'Agro Sarnese-Nocerino D.O.P., Pomodorini di Corbara, and Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio D.O.P. Canned, peeled tomatoes (Pomodoro Pelato San Marzano dell'Agro Sarnese-Nocerino D.O.P.) as long as they're strained, broken up, and homogenized. And depending on whether you're making a Margherita or marinara, you ladle ""sauce"" (according to the organization's founder Antonio Pace, technically it's not a sauce) on and top it with oil, mozzarella or fior di latte, grated cheese, and basil; or just tomato, oil, oregano, and garlic.Click here for America's Healthiest Fast-Food Breakfast SandwichesThings get more contentious.Maybe great pizza means the use of the freshest ingredients and seasonal toppings? Does it involve a structural integrity to the underlying dough that ensures you can lift a slice without experiencing droopage? Is it an airy, charred cornicione that makes even the most ardent crust-chucker certain not to leave one pizza bone behind? Must it employ artisanal sausage, or does old-school pepperoni count? Does it involve fresh mozzarella? Or just the expert scattering and sauce to cheese ratio of good old-fashioned, low-moisture aged mozzarella and sauce made from canned San Marzano tomatoes? Does a bar pie count? And how do you stack those up against deep-dish pies?!Click here to see Mind-Blowing Bacon DishesThese are all questions you could get lost debating for hours. For me, great pizza doesn't include deep dish. That's not pizza. It's a casserole for crying out loud. Great pizza is a thin-crust New York slice right out of the oven that you can fold and that keeps its structural integrity despite the generous cheese, sauce, and orange oil on top about to burn the roof of your mouth that you're compelled to bite into anyway. It's a bar pie topped with hot pepper oil at Colony Grill in Stamford, Conn., or Eddie's in New Hyde Park -- pizza so thin that it's more like a hot cracker with your favorite toppings. It's the best renditions of Long Island's much-overlooked pan-crisped genre: the grandma pie. It's the charred, airy crust of Da Michele that inspires devotion and poetry, and the renditions in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, and New York City that aspire to and almost achieve that level of greatness. It's South Brooklyn Pizza (the East Village location), Little Vincent's incredibly saucy and bubble-crusted pie in Huntington, Long Island, Bianco's pistachio pie in Phoenix, and Great Lake's chewy crust in Chicago. For me, in its purest form, great pizza is fresh pizza: thin, cheesy, saucy, and with an airy bubbled crust. I could go on, but this isn't my list.You could argue that all of these things should be taken into account when compiling a list. When it comes to pizza, there are so many nuances, there should be niche lists detailing the best in each category. The Daily Meal will take that approach next year. In 2012, we did the next best thing: we assembled a panel of experts across America, and asked them to vote for the country's best pies.How did this list come to be? The Daily Meal's editors racked their collective pizza memory. We consulted venerable texts and online sources, sought out old-school Formica-table joints and brazen newcomers alike. We carefully considered the stalwarts of the country's two pizza capitals, New York City and (cough) Chicago, but not so closely that we couldn't look beyond them. We ended up with a list of more than 140 places for pizza, most any of which, you'd be very happy with stopping in for a pie.Knowing that it might still be possible to miss quite a few local gems across the country, we then asked each member of our panel to write in with five suggestions of their own. Altogether, we turned 140 places over to our panel and asked them narrow things down to five spots for each of seven regions: West Coast; Southwest and Texas; Midwest; South; Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, and New Jersey; New England; and yes, New York City.There were hundreds of votes cast by a venerable panel of about 20 American chefs, restaurant critics, and pizza authorities, most of whom, besides the Los Angeles Times' Jonathan Gold and Chicago Magazine's Penny Pollack, requested anonymity. These are people who, like you (and us) live and die pizza. And you know what? The results are probably going to really bubble your crust, and burn your upskirt. That's just the nature of a list like this.Panelists voted on places that you'd expect to make a best pizza list, like Bianco in Phoenix, Di Fara in Brooklyn, Pizzeria Mozza in LA, New Haven's Frank Pepe, and Una Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco. But they also put these places side by side with deep-dish pies in Chicago, and... wait, is that the jumbo slice from D.C? (Man, you've got to think that The Washington Post's Tom Sietsema and Tim Carman are going to be so mad.)No $1-slice joints made the list. Neither probably, did several of your, or our favorites. Consider that in New York City alone, Roberta's, Kesté, Paulie Gee's, and South Brooklyn Pizza (that East Village outpost) didn't make the list. Neither did Pizza Moto (arguably, New York City's most underrated pizza -- seriously, New York, how have you not acknowledged this as one of Gotham's best?).That's the way these things go, until everyone can attest to having visited every reputable pizza place across the country. Think we missed a few great places? We're sure we did. Clue us in in the comments below and they'll be sure to be considered next year.- Arthur Bovino, The Daily MealMore from The Daily Meal: America's 15 Best French Fries Coolest Food Trucks Ever America's Best Fried Chicken The Best (and Worst) Hot Dogs to Buy"

Based on the book, I held this conversation with my spouse at what would be our final counseling session:""I'm ready to talk about what happened. This isn't easy for either of us, but I have some things to say and I would like you to agree to hear me out and not interrupt or contradict me. When I'm done you can have all the time you want to respond and I promise to hear you out as well. Are you willing to do that? Good. Husband, I know we've talked about the issue of your affair before, but I need to go over it in a calmer way with you now and see if there is any possibility of salvaging our relationship. ""Here's what I know for sure. I know that you lied to me about the reasons for staying late at work, the necessity of being at work and for working the hours you did. I know that at some point in the last year you started an emotional and then a physical relationship with another woman. When we first talked about it a few months ago, you lied and said that you were going to treat her like any other colleague and would act honorably while you and I figured 'us' out. And then, about two weeks ago, you admitted to spending the night at her house and being physically intimate with her. Then I asked you to move out. Those are the facts. ""This whole experience makes me feel so many emotions. I feel betrayed, hurt, angry. I feel sad, confused and discouraged. I feel insulted, blindsided and deceived to my core. I am disappointed and uncertain. ""So here is what I need from you, now, in order to agree to consider staying in the relationship. I'm not making any promises about the future, but I'm willing to work with you to see if we can and want to build a new relationship, a different relationship; one that is not the status quo. What I have today is a firm, non-negotiable list of requirements that must be met in order for me to begin thinking about whether it's possible to continue as husband and wife.""First, you must acknowledge and take responsibility for your affair and admit how terribly you've hurt me, how what we had is forever changed because of your decisions. You absolutely cannot continue to work or volunteer at that place, where our marriage would be in constant threat and where you've proved that you cannot be around her without compromise. I want your promise that you will not see or communicate with that woman at all, starting now.""You know that I'm in counseling and I want you to do the same so that you can understand why you've done this and how to make better decisions in the future. You must commit to a monogamous relationship with me, and you must be willing and interested in actively working with me to build a new relationship based on truth and honesty and respect. I also want you to know that there must be an end to hiding things and deceiving me. These are my requirements. Nothing on this list is unreasonable.Him: ""You're right. Those are perfectly reasonable requests that would be necessary to fix the relationship... But I can't do them.""Me: ""Can't or won't?""Him: ""Won't. I don't want to.""Me: ""So... would it be accurate to say you want a divorce?""Him: ""Yes.""That night I slept soundly for the first time in months. Yes, it was the end, but it was also a beginning."
2,MONEY,Walmart Same-Day Delivery To Be Tested During Holiday Shopping Season To Challenge Amazon,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/walmart-same-day-delivery-amazon_us_5b9c62c9e4b03a1dcc7e457a,"The test of the ""Walmart To Go"" service began in Northern Virginia and Philadelphia earlier this month and is set to expand",2012-10-09,"FILE-In this Thursday, May 12, 2005, file photo, customers leave Wal-Mart as a machine pushes shopping carts back to the store in Cheektowaga, N.Y.

(AP Photo/David Duprey, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c62c92500003200360b44.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jessica WohlOct 9 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is testing same-day delivery of televisions, toys and other general merchandise bought online in a few U.S. markets as it tries to find new ways to keep up with competitors and to attract busy shoppers this holiday season.The test of the ""Walmart To Go"" service began in Northern Virginia and Philadelphia earlier this month and is set to expand to Minneapolis on Tuesday, Walmart U.S. said. Walmart then plans to expand the test to California's San Jose/San Francisco market in late October or early November.The latest test comes as the world's largest retailer faces increasingly sharp competition from Web retailer Amazon.com Inc and others. The new test gives Walmart a chance to connect its updated website with its thousands of stores in order to make the chain more convenient to shoppers.The test is not the only way that Walmart is working on marrying the reach of its thousands of stores with its online business. In September, Walmart U.S. President Bill Simon said that Walmart uses a group of stores around the country to fulfill online orders, which reduces shipping costs and time.In that speech, at a Goldman Sachs event, Simon mentioned that Walmart was quietly playing with same-day delivery but did not say which markets may have been participating.In the new test, shoppers in the Northern Virginia, Philadelphia and Minneapolis markets can pay a $10 flat fee for same-day delivery of items picked from general merchandise items carried in local stores. Customers can chose an unlimited number of those items.Customers in those three markets must sign up, place their orders by noon and pick one of three four-hour windows for delivery later in the day. The goods are delivered by United Parcel Service Inc.Some details of the test, such as the $10 fee, were posted on a website run by Kantar Retail IQ earlier this month.In San Jose and San Francisco, Walmart already uses its own trucks for online grocery delivery in a pilot that began in 2010. Walmart will use its own trucks rather than UPS to deliver other goods there, and shoppers will still need to order by 7 a.m. local time.For now, Walmart To Go is only being tested in four markets during the holiday season, including the test in Minneapolis, the hometown of Walmart competitor Target Corp.A Walmart survey found that the majority of respondents said that they would consider using same-day delivery. More than half of the more than 1,500 survey participants said that they would use same-day delivery monthly or more frequently, Walmart said.Walmart's other services offered nationally include Site to Store, where customers order online and pick up items at local stores; Pickup Today, which allows customers to pick out items online to pick up the same day in stores; and Pay with Cash, where shoppers go online to pick out items and then pay for them with cash in a Walmart store.Pay with Cash, launched in April, has proven popular with those who cannot or do not want to use credit cards to make online purchases. Pay with Cash accounts for 2 percent of Walmart.com purchases, the company said.The program follows Wal-Mart's launch in April 2010 of same-day grocery delivery in San Jose. That was also tested in San Francisco over the past year.Wal-Mart Stores Inc., based in Bentonville, Ark., operates more than 4,000 stores in the U.S."

Big Bird is endangered. Jim Lehrer lost control. And Mitt Romney crushed President Barack Obama. Those were the judgments rendered across Twitter and Facebook Wednesday during the first debate of the 2012 presidential contest. While millions turned on their televisions to watch the 90-minute showdown, a smaller but highly engaged subset took to social networks to discuss and score the debate as it unspooled in real time. (AP Photo/Matt Sayles, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c60fa240000310094a6b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Feeding my three-year-old picky eater grandson becomes much easier when I let him watch a few scenes from Sesame Street while he eats. But that's not the main reason for my defense of Big Bird and public television versus the commercial networks that Mr. Romney presumably prefers for children--no doubt in the spirit of free enterprise versus government support of quality television. The main reason is that an important research study has shown that Big Bird and his Muppet friends are not harmful to children's ability to think and focus, whereas some cartoons on commercial television stations are harmful to these abilities in children.I am referring to a study that was published last September in Pediatrics, the official journal of The American Academy of Pediatrics, called ""The Immediate Impact of Different Types of Television on Young Children's Executive Function."" The study examines the effects of watching fast-paced cartoons on the attention span and memory of four year old children. In this study, researchers divided 60 four year-olds into three groups. Each group was put into a room and directed to do one of the following activities: draw with crayons, watch a PBS show called Caillou, or watch a fast-paced commercial TV show called Sponge Bob. After nine minutes, the children took a battery of tests that required focus, concentration, patience, working memory, and manipulation. Researchers were hoping to capture the ""executive function"" of a child's brain with the tests.The results of the study were remarkably in tune with what common sense has been telling us for years. Children who watched the fast-paced cartoons on commercial television did significantly worse on the attention and memory testing than the children in the other two groups. There was no difference in performance between the educational TV (Caillou) group and the group that had drawn pictures with crayons. The researchers concluded that just nine minutes of viewing a fast-paced television cartoon had immediate negative effects on 4-year-olds' executive brain function. They issued the warning: ""Parents should be aware that fast-paced television shows could at least temporarily impair young children's executive function.""So what was it about the fast-paced show that had a negative effect on the children's brains? What the researchers concluded was that the unnatural pace of the cartoon sequences was over-stimulating and stressful to the child's brain. The human-Muppet interactions on Sesame Street are naturally paced, whereas the Sponge Bob sequences were unnaturally rapid and the over-stimulation from the ""surreal"" pacing may have taxed the children's brains.In an editorial in the same issue of Pediatrics, Dimitri Christakis, M.D., of Seattle Children's Hospital, writes that although the study was small, its results are nonetheless robust and critically important: ""Connecting fast-paced television viewing to deficits in executive function, regardless of whether they are transient, has profound implications for children's cognitive and social development that need to be considered and reacted to... what makes programs good or bad has to do not only with the content itself but with what in communications research are known as the formal features of that content. Some sequences are naturally paced (eg, human-Muppet interactions on Sesame Street), and some are rapid (eg, Sponge Bob Square Pants). Others occur in what seems like slow motion (eg, Mr. Roger's Neighborhood)."" What does this study mean for parents who want to avoid having the executive functions of their child's brain impaired by television shows? It speaks to the importance for parents to focus on the quality of the various TV shows that are available for kids. The study strongly argues that parents should not allow kids to watch cartoons that are unnaturally fast-paced--the kind of cartoons that are readily available commercial television. If parents do not want to stress their child's brain, they should stick to PBS--and hope that Mr. Romney does not get the opportunity to obliterate it."
