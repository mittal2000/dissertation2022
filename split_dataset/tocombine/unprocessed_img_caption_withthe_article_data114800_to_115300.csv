Israeli airstrikes hit a wide range of locations along the coastal area of the Gaza Strip as diplomatic efforts intensified to end the two week war that has killed hundreds of Palestinians and dozens of Israelis. (AP Photo/Hatem Moussa)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13aec2400003200381adb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"* PLO endorsement could help Cairo's truce bid* Israel presses offensive, Gaza toll hits 624* Slain officer brings Israeli losses to 31* Foreign airlines shun Tel Aviv over rocket risk (Updates Israeli death toll)By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Dan WilliamsGAZA/JERUSALEM, July 23 (Reuters) - The Palestinian decision-making body led by U.S.-backed President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday endorsed demands by Hamas for halting Gaza hostilities with Israel, a closing of ranks that may help Egyptian-mediated truce efforts.With Israeli and U.S. encouragement, Egypt has tried to get both sides to hold fire and then negotiate terms for protracted calm in the Palestinian enclave where officials said 624 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in 15 days of fighting.Hamas, the Gaza Strip's dominant Islamists, and other armed factions had balked at Cairo's offer, saying they wanted assurances of relief from an Israeli-Egyptian blockade and other concessions. The dispute was further complicated by distrust between Egypt under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Hamas.In a move that could effectively turn Abbas into the main interlocutor for a Gaza truce, his umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on Wednesday formally supported core conditions set by the Hamas-led fighters.""The Gaza demands of stopping the aggression and lifting the blockade in all its forms are the demands of the entire Palestinian people and they represent the goal that the Palestinian leadership has dedicated all its power to achieve,"" senior PLO official Yasser Abed Rabbo said in Ramallah, the hub city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank where Abbas is based.""We are confident Gaza will not be broken as long as our people are standing beside it to support it through all possible means until the invaders understand that our great people inside the homeland and outside will not leave Gaza alone.""Signaling that Abbas, too, sought a staggered cessation of hostilities, the Palestinian leader's Fatah faction on Tuesday proposed a truce followed by five days of negotiations on terms.There was no immediate response to the PLO statement from Hamas or Israel, which pressed the Gaza offensive it began on July 8 after a surge of cross-border rocket salvoes. VIOLENCE AFFECTS FLIGHTSIsrael has lost 29 soldiers in the Gaza clashes, including a tank officer who the army said on Wednesday had been killed by a Palestinian sniper overnight. Two Israeli civilians have been killed by shelling by Palestinian fighters that has reached deep into the Jewish state, spreading panic despite the success of its Iron Dome rocket interceptor and civilian shelters.Three Palestinians died in Israeli strikes on Wednesday, Gaza officials said. Rocket launches set off air-raid sirens in southern Israel, but there was no word of casualties.There was also violence in the West Bank, where a Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli troops near Bethlehem. The army said soldiers fired a rubber bullet at him during a confrontation with dozens of Palestinians hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails.Egyptian sources, speaking on Tuesday as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Cairo to advance truce efforts, said a unified Palestinian position could help achieve a deal.Unlike Hamas, which refuses permanent coexistence with the Jewish state, the PLO has pursued peacemaking for two decades.Those efforts were set back in April when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called off U.S.-sponsored peace negotiations over Abbas's surprise power-share deal with Hamas.Yet Netanyahu stopped short of cutting ties with Abbas, whose forces help secure the West Bank, and foreign mediators continue to see the Palestinian leader as someone the Israelis can negotiate with.Having unilaterally accepted an Egyptian-proposed truce last week that was rejected by Hamas, the Israelis made clear on Tuesday they would not stand down before their forces destroyed Hamas's military infrastructure, including rocket sites and a network of tunnels used for cross-border Palestinian raids.""A cease-fire is not near,"" said Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, the most dovish member of Netanyahu's security cabinet.Yet Israel faced mounting international alarm at the toll on Palestinian civilians, as well as economic pressure from lost tourism that soared on Tuesday when the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) took the rare step of banning flights to Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion International Airport for at least 24 hours after a rocket from Gaza struck nearby, wounding two people.European airlines also canceled flights to Israel, whose own carriers continued to operate.An Israeli official said Netanyahu asked Kerry to help restore the U.S. flights. A U.S. official said the Obama administration would not ""overrule the FAA"" on a security precaution but noted the ban would be reviewed after 24 hours. FOCUS ON HAMASFollowing meetings in Egypt, which has some leverage over Hamas through its control of its border with Gaza, Kerry said on Tuesday there was still ""work to do"" to resolve the conflict and urged the Palestinian Islamists to pursue negotiations.Because Washington, like Israel and the European Union, deems Hamas a terrorist group, they have no direct contact and Washington must rely on proxies such as Egypt, Qatar and Turkey.In a sign of the intensity of the U.S. diplomacy, Kerry spoke to Netanyahu and to Qatari and Turkish foreign ministers after meeting Sisi for two hours, a senior U.S. official said.""The Egyptians have provided a framework and a forum for them to be able to come to the table to have a serious discussion together with other factions of the Palestinians,"" Kerry said. ""Hamas has a fundamental choice to make and it is a choice that will have a profound impact for the people of Gaza.""Angered by an Israeli crackdown on its supporters in the West Bank and by Gaza's hardship under blockade, Hamas has said it is willing to continue fighting. In addition to freeing up Gaza's borders, Hamas wants a prisoner release by Israel.The Egyptian plan does not specify a timeline for easing the blockade, saying ""crossings shall be opened and the passage of persons and goods through border crossings shall be facilitated once the security situation becomes stable on the ground"".U.S. officials view Qatar, a tiny, gas-rich Gulf state that has supported Hamas financially and hosts some of the militant group's senior leaders, as important to the diplomacy.In contrast, the Egyptian government is deeply suspicious of Hamas as it is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood movement toppled from power in Cairo by then-army chief Sisi last year.Israel is openly opposed to giving Qatar or Turkey leading roles in mediation, given its troubled ties with both countries.The upcoming Eid al-Fitr festival - Islam's biggest annual celebration that follows the end of the fasting month of Ramadan this weekend - could provide all sides with a convenient moment to agree to a cease-fire.Asked about Eid, a senior Obama administration official said: ""It's a potential opportunity. We want there to be a cease-fire as soon as possible basically, and insofar as that's a marker that can compel Hamas to the table that would be a good thing, but the bottom line is they're going to have to stop firing rockets.""

More than one million Australians have already installed solar panels on their rooftops. It has caused demand for electricity from the grid to plummet. The race to power Australian homes from the sun has left Prime Minister Tony Abbott's Coalition government speechless. Photo credit: smh.com.au  Despite being a sun-rich country, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott continues to promote coal, a known heat-trapping pollutant, as the only source of energy for the future.  The government has just spent over $50 billion upgrading the coal-powered energy grid expecting more demand for more electricity. By the time coal-powered electricity reaches Australian homes it has traveled hundreds of miles through the grid - a network of wires, cables and poles. Photo credit: originenergy.com.au  As a result of falling demand, the remaining customers are being charged more for electricity. So more people are switching to solar.  The Australian boom for solar installations shows no sign of slowing down. Over one million Australian households are generating their own electricity from the sun and avoiding government-owned network charges of $349 million annually. Photo credit: abc.net.au In the meantime, Abbott's Coalition government has abolished the carbon tax. It's just another in a series of initiatives to promote coal and undermine innovations in renewable energies like solar thermal and ocean wave farms.The Hazelwood coal power station in Victoria's La Trobe Valley spewing tons of toxic mercury vapor into Earth's biosphere. Photo credit: abc.net.au  The Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, spent one year studying and writing a university thesis on ""A Tax To Make The Polluters Pay."" It appears that at one point in his life he believed, ""it better ensures that the polluter bears full responsibility for the cost of his or her conduct."" That was when he was young and not in charge of the environment, which regularly takes a back-seat to the Coalition's economic plan for the coming decade, one which will see a ramping-up of coal production to a whopping 770 million metric tons per annum - a death knell for the biosphere.  The abolition of the carbon tax comes at a time when Australian researchers lead the renewable energy sector with breakthrough solar thermal 'supercritical' steam. It's another game-changer for power stations enabling them to utilize supercritical solar steam that pressurizes water with enormous force. Heat from the sun, reflected off a field of heliostats (or mirrors) is concentrated onto a central receiver point to create the steam at these supercritical levels. This phenomenal achievement is likened to breaking the sound barrier. It is so impressive, its possible implications for solar thermal technology is revolutionary. Photo credit: abc.net.au  Solar thermal can almost compete with the peak performance capabilities of fossil fuel sources especially as the International Monetary Fund disclosed when the global fossil fuel industry subsidies of $1.9 trillion annually are removed and the playing field is leveled. For the past 15 years, climate disruption has battered the Australian continent. Bushfires, prolonged sub-continental drought, extreme heat waves and enormous floods are occurring more often, eclipsing more records more frequently.  Australian households are fighting back against climate disruption by leaving the coal-powered electricity grid in droves. Technological advances in battery capacity enable households to now operate during peak demand, at night. The price of solar panels in Australia has plunged by 80 percent over the past 4 years. One in eight households is now powered by the sun and the race has only just begun! Photo credit: abc.net.au  Tony Abbott and Greg Hunt have bet the 'family farm' on coal, a dirty, old, heat-trapping technology that's killing the Great Barrier Reef and contaminating the biosphere. Australian households, on the other hand, are leaving the coal-powered grid by capitalizing on innovation that harnesses the power of the sun thereby erasing their carbon footprints. We need a government that is in touch with the people.Earth Dr Reese Halter is a broadcaster and conservation biologist. His upcoming book is ""Shepherding the Sea: The Race to Save Our Oceans."""

More than one million Australians have already installed solar panels on their rooftops. It has caused demand for electricity from the grid to plummet. The race to power Australian homes from the sun has left Prime Minister Tony Abbott's Coalition government speechless. Photo credit: smh.com.au  Despite being a sun-rich country, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott continues to promote coal, a known heat-trapping pollutant, as the only source of energy for the future.  The government has just spent over $50 billion upgrading the coal-powered energy grid expecting more demand for more electricity. By the time coal-powered electricity reaches Australian homes it has traveled hundreds of miles through the grid - a network of wires, cables and poles. Photo credit: originenergy.com.au  As a result of falling demand, the remaining customers are being charged more for electricity. So more people are switching to solar.  The Australian boom for solar installations shows no sign of slowing down. Over one million Australian households are generating their own electricity from the sun and avoiding government-owned network charges of $349 million annually.

It's just another in a series of initiatives to promote coal and undermine innovations in renewable energies like solar thermal and ocean wave farms.The Hazelwood coal power station in Victoria's La Trobe Valley spewing tons of toxic mercury vapor into Earth's biosphere. Photo credit: abc.net.au  The Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, spent one year studying and writing a university thesis on ""A Tax To Make The Polluters Pay."" It appears that at one point in his life he believed, ""it better ensures that the polluter bears full responsibility for the cost of his or her conduct."" That was when he was young and not in charge of the environment, which regularly takes a back-seat to the Coalition's economic plan for the coming decade, one which will see a ramping-up of coal production to a whopping 770 million metric tons per annum - a death knell for the biosphere.  The abolition of the carbon tax comes at a time when Australian researchers lead the renewable energy sector with breakthrough solar thermal 'supercritical' steam. It's another game-changer for power stations enabling them to utilize supercritical solar steam that pressurizes water with enormous force. Heat from the sun, reflected off a field of heliostats (or mirrors) is concentrated onto a central receiver point to create the steam at these supercritical levels. This phenomenal achievement is likened to breaking the sound barrier. It is so impressive, its possible implications for solar thermal technology is revolutionary. Photo credit: abc.net.au  Solar thermal can almost compete with the peak performance capabilities of fossil fuel sources especially as the International Monetary Fund disclosed when the global fossil fuel industry subsidies of $1.9 trillion annually are removed and the playing field is leveled. For the past 15 years, climate disruption has battered the Australian continent. Bushfires, prolonged sub-continental drought, extreme heat waves and enormous floods are occurring more often, eclipsing more records more frequently.  Australian households are fighting back against climate disruption by leaving the coal-powered electricity grid in droves. Technological advances in battery capacity enable households to now operate during peak demand, at night. The price of solar panels in Australia has plunged by 80 percent over the past 4 years. One in eight households is now powered by the sun and the race has only just begun! Photo credit: abc.net.au  Tony Abbott and Greg Hunt have bet the 'family farm' on coal, a dirty, old, heat-trapping technology that's killing the Great Barrier Reef and contaminating the biosphere. Australian households, on the other hand, are leaving the coal-powered grid by capitalizing on innovation that harnesses the power of the sun thereby erasing their carbon footprints. We need a government that is in touch with the people.Earth Dr Reese Halter is a broadcaster and conservation biologist. His upcoming book is ""Shepherding the Sea: The Race to Save Our Oceans."""

But for those Christian fans of his, he's become quite the heartbreaker. Is his argument that religion leads to war on target, or does he miss the mark?In an interview about his new album ""Hypnotic Eye,"" Petty was asked about a bonus track song: ""Playing Dumb."" Evidently it dealt with the Catholic Church covering up the sexual abuse scandal.In elaborating on his disdain for the hush money paid out, Petty went on to take a shot at all religion, and its perceived connection to conflict, according to Chris Willman with Yahoo Music. ""Petty also arches his eyebrow toward not just the Catholic Church but religion in general in the article, saying, 'Religion seems to me to be at the base of all wars... I've nothing against defending yourself, but I don't think, spiritually speaking, that there's any conception of God that should be telling you to be violent. It seems to me that no one's got Christ more wrong than the Christians.'""Petty is hardly the only one to claim that religion is connected to conflict. Dr. John Kelsay, a professor of comparative religious ethics, and author of several books about religion and war, writes ""What will be the story of religion and war for the next quarter century? From all indications, it will be less the story of enhanced diplomatic initiatives-fostered by the ever-growing interconnections in economy, information technology, and environmental awareness-and more the story of increasingly bloody conflict, fostered by a resurgence of group identities. In such conflict, religion will serve less as a force for peace, more as one of several factors establishing differences between groups, and legitimating their irreconcilable claims. Considering the emphasis of writers at the beginning of the 20th century, it's an ironic commentary-but at century's end, we should prepare to see religion less in the service of peace; more in the service of a particularly bloody kind of war.""To test that argument about the connection, my students and I looked into the subject. To determine if a war is religious or not, we looked at the issues of conflict data collected by Kalevi J. Holsti in his book Peace and War: Armed Conflict and International Order, 1648-1989, by the Cambridge Studies in International Relations.In each century of analysis, our research found that religion was very infrequently a source of conflict. Never once did we see it factor in more than six conflicts. Three other issues of conflict (regimes, real estate and riches) were far more likely to act as a reason to fight. Religion and Issues of ConflictThere are several reasons for why we think religion is linked to conflict. First, if a war does have a religious component (however infrequently), it gets a lot more attention from the media. Second, a lot of wars we think are religious aren't. When Protestants and Catholics fight in North Ireland, they aren't fighting over details about the Eucharist or Virgin Birth, according to Time magazine columnist Lance Morrow. The issue is about political power and representation in the government, even jobs and real estate. If anything, religious leaders are often the ones working to stop the conflict, rather than start it.Petty is right; countries have gone to war over religion. But it's a fairly rare event over the last four centuries. It's certainly not ""at the base of all wars,"" as Petty claims.John A.

(AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d9883e280000f6376ff757.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ahmed RasheedBAGHDAD, July 23 (Reuters) - Islamic State militants seized four small oilfields when they swept through north Iraq last month and are now selling crude oil and gasoline from them to finance their newly declared ""caliphate"".Near the northern city of Mosul, the Islamic State has taken over the Najma and Qayara fields, while further south near Tikrit it overran the Himreen and Ajil fields during its two-day sweep through northern Iraq in mid-June.The oilfields in Islamic State hands are modest compared to Iraq's giant fields near Kirkuk and Basra, which are under Kurdish and central government control. Most of the Islamic State-held oil wells - estimated by a Kurdish official to number around 80 - are sealed and not pumping.But the monopoly over fuel in the territory it has captured gives the Islamic State leverage over other armed Sunni factions who could threaten its dominance in northern Iraq.Iraqi officials say that in recent weeks the group has transported oil from Qayara to be processed by mobile refineries in Syria into low quality gasoil and gasoline, then brought back for sale in Mosul, a city of 2 million people.Larger shipments of crude, some of them from Najma, are also sold via smugglers to Turkish traders at vastly discounted prices of around $25 per barrel, they said.""We have confirmed reports showing that the Islamic State is shipping crude from Najma oilfield in Mosul into Syria to smuggle it to one of Syria's neighbors,"" said Husham al-Brefkani, head of Mosul provincial council's energy committee.""The Islamic State is making multi-million dollar profits from this illegal trade.""Petrol stations in Mosul are now selling fuel supplied by traders working with the Islamic State, which charges either $1.0 or $1.5 a liter depending on quality - a huge increase on previous prices, one petrol station owner in the city said.""The fuel is brought from Syria ... It's triple the price before, but drivers have to buy it because subsidized government fuel was halted,"" he said.Brefkani said the Islamic State was the sole sponsor of the imports from Syria, where the group also controls oilfields in the Syrian province of Deir al-Zor. ""They use part of it for their vehicles and sell the rest to their traders in Mosul."" MILITANTS KEPT OILFIELD INTACTNajma and Qayara had been operated by Angola's state-owned firm Sonangol, but it pulled out last year declaring force majeure amid rising development costs and security concerns over Sunni militants in the area, even before last month's assault.Qayara, which has estimated reserves of 800 million barrels, had been producing 7,000 barrels per day of heavy crude before the Islamic State took over the field and a nearby 16,000 bpd refinery. Qayara refinery and second smaller plant at Kasak, northwest of Mosul, stopped operating when staff fled.But Qayara oilfield itself has kept pumping after the militants asked Iraqi employees to stay at their posts, promising to protect them - as they have done at most oil facilities in order to maintain production.Iraqi official gave the example of the battle to seize Baiji refinery in the north, Iraq's largest, where the Islamic States and other insurgents have been trying since mid-June to control the site without damaging its facilities.""(The Islamic State) were keen to keep energy installations inside Qayara intact. We did not realize why they did not destroy facilities, but a week later they started to fill the trucks with Qayara crude. They were planning from the beginning to profiteer the field,"" said an engineer who works at Qayara, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.Iraqi government sources said it was hard to assess how much money the group makes from selling crude or the fuel refined in Syria as the number of trucks fluctuates daily. One source said that a separate - and now terminated - smuggling operation into the Kurdish enclave and into Iran generated nearly $1 million a day earlier this month.One dealer and shipping company owner in Mosul said he buys 250-barrel truckloads of crude from the militants for $6,000.""The next step depends on our cunning in dealing with the Turkish traders,"" he said. FROM TAXES TO NYMEX?As another revenue earner, the Islamic militant group levies taxes on all vehicles and trucks bringing goods into Mosul.A large truck must pay $400, while small trucks are charged $100 and cars $50 if they are also carrying goods.Ahmed Younis, a Baghdad expert on armed groups, said the Islamists were in effect establishing an economic state based on the increasing resources and infrastructure under their command.Considering its spread across the Syria-Iraq border, its grip over oilfields there and its growing economic activity, the Islamic State will ""transform into an economic giant with assets of billions of dollars,"" he said.""In future, will they buy shares in NYMEX? Everything is possible,"" Younis said. TIKRIT OILFIELDSFurther south Islamic State fighters control another two oilfields east of Tikrit, home town of Saddam Hussein.One of them, Ajil, produced 25,000 bpd of crude that were shipped to the Kirkuk refinery and 150 million cubic feet of gas per day piped to the government-controlled Kirkuk power station.The gas is still pumped - albeit at lower volume of about 100 million cubic feet daily - because, according to energy experts, Kirkuk power station supplies many towns in the region and the militants want to avoid energy shortages.The militants are moving only small amounts of oil from Ajil because of fears that their primitive extraction techniques could ignite the gas, according to an engineer at the site.The other small oilfield captured by the Islamic State is Himreen, with a capacity of 5,000-6,000 barrels per day from five operating oil wells.""The militants brought technicians from outside Tikrit to deal with crude from Himreen and they started to dig up craters and siphon crude out of the wells using small water irrigation pumps,"" said an oil ministry employee working at the field.An Iraqi security official said trucks used to smuggle crude from Ajil and Himreen into Iraqi Kurdistan and Iran. Kurdish peshmerga forces used to turn a blind eye.But Iraqi national security forces as well as the peshmerga began to halt the trade on July 12, he said. The army used helicopters to bomb trucks heading east from Tikrit, while Kurdish security forces seized trucks with smuggled crude crossing into territories under their control.""We have managed to destroy more than 50 trucks as of July 12,"" Iraqi counter-terrorism spokesman Sabah Nouri said. ""Our helicopter strikes hit the smuggling process hard and cut a vital source of finance to the terrorists.""An oil ministry adviser estimated that in the first two weeks of July, before the operation was halted, the Islamic State made around $10 million - nearly $1 million a day.The mayor of Tuz Khuramto, a town on the route between Tikrit, the Kurdish enclave and Iran, said the smuggling route had been shut down 10 days ago.""Before that, between 30 to 60 trucks moved into the Kurdish region, but now we can say number is zero,"" Shallal Abdul said.
