0,TRAVEL,Dublin Travel: 10 Must-Sees In The City Of A Thousand Welcomes,"Emi Boscamp, Contributor

Yes, it's worth the money over the Aircoach or the DublinBus because engaging in conversation with Dubliners one-on-one is the best way to experience the city. I would not be surprised if it were a requirement for every cab driver in Dublin to have a witty personality. They will give you their personalized tours of the city -- hilarious, unfiltered stories included. I visited Dublin three months ago while I was studying abroad in Europe, and while I only spent three days there, the food, the beer, the music, and above all, the people left a lasting impression on me. Herewith, my must-sees for Dublin visitors:  1. Trinity College: Trinity's buildings are a mix of classical and contemporary architecture spread around elegant gardens. A leisurely stroll around its campus is ideal in the morning, before students are rushing to class. The Old Library is also truly a sight to behold: stacks of ancient wooden bookshelves that seem to go on endlessly.  2. The Little Museum of Dublin: An exhibition entitled ""Your Huddled Masses: The Irish in America"" tells the story of the Irish in America in a boldly original way, using sound, photography, film and striking illustrations to captivate the public imagination. It's a story of hardship and suffering, hope and retribution: the search for a better life. It's about the re-invention of home and the birth of great cities in a foreign land. It's a political story, but also a story about something more essential still: the American Dream. The exhibit begins next week through mid-September.  3. Cathach Books: This quaint and cozy bookstore specializing in 20th century Irish literature holds many treasures, including a large selection of first editions from this genre's masters: Joyce, Yeats, Beckett, and Wilde.4. Fallon & Byrne: This deli is perfect for a quick lunch. Head to the food hall to find just about anything: delicious soups and sandwiches, potent coffee, fresh fruit and vegetables, decadent cakes, aged meat, just-caught fish, cheese, charcuterie, and antipasti.5. The Winding Stair Bookshop & Café: It became a famous landmark in the 1970s and 1980s as a popular meeting place for writers, musicians, and artists with its iconic view of the Ha'penny bridge, but was then closed in 2005. In 2006, Elaine Murphy brought it back to life as a café with simple, old-fashioned, high-quality Irish cooking, and an extensive wine list. The bookshop remains on the ground floor.6. Chapter One: This Michelin star restaurant in the center of Dublin focuses on local and seasonal produce to create its diverse take on modern Irish cuisine. From squab pigeon with foie gras and chestnut mousse, red wine glaze, smoked butter milk potato and fried cabbage to rump of lamb cooked in smoked oil with nettle flavor barley, salt baked turnips, fried sweetbreads and pickled garlic, the menu speaks for itself.7. The Chop House: Anthony Bourdain described his experience at the Chop House as ""the best f**king meal I've ever eaten in Dublin."" The menu is diverse; the main focus is on traditional French cuisine but it also incorporates an Asian influence. If you're looking for reasonable prices, a very casual atmosphere, and Michelin-quality food, this gastro-pub is for you.8. John Kavanagh: This 150-year-old pub is known to Dubliners as ""The Gravediggers"" owing to its location next to Glasnevin cemetery. It's off the beaten path, but it keeps locals coming for lifetimes. Don't order anything but Guinness here. I don't even think you can. It's good.9. Slattery's Bar: Located in the Rathmines district, a mile-and-a-half south of central Dublin, it's far from the well-trodden tourist path. For those looking to start early, the bar opens at 7am. It's filled with older, lifelong regulars reading the paper and betting on horses. And you can get a hearty, delicious Irish breakfast alongside your perfectly poured pint of Guinness.10. Guinness Storehouse: Definitely buy your ticket online beforehand; you will pay €14.85 instead of €16.50, and you won't have to wait in line. While the tour itself is definitely less than awe-inspiring, being that it consists of walking around in a line, watching videos of how the beer is made, the 360° view of Dublin from the Gravity Bar is worth the trip. You can sit, relax, and enjoy a complimentary glass of the black goodness surrounded by breathtaking views.Click through the slideshow below to view photos of these must-sees!"

And true to form, they love to make lists of the best beers out there. The two most influential lists of this type are probably the Top 50 on RateBeer.com and the Top 250 on Beer Advocate.

4,WEDDINGS,The Truth About Planning a Wedding,"Lauren Grove, Contributor
Owner & Editor, Every Last Detail",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-truth-about-planning_us_5b9d444ae4b03a1dcc861a4e,"There is so much information out there about planning a wedding -- but how do you know what is right, what will work for you, and more importantly -- what the truth is?",2013-06-17,2013-06-17-2gian_carlo_photography_central_florida_international_weddings002.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-06-17-2gian_carlo_photography_central_florida_international_weddings002.jpg,"There is so much information out there about planning a wedding -- but how do you know what is right, what will work for you, and more importantly -- what the truth is? When I was planning my own wedding, I kept turning to the internet for answers, but always came up empty-handed. For some reason, the answers that I found weren't quite cutting it- they just didn't feel like they were ""right."" I found myself wanting to the know the truth about planning a wedding. After my own wedding, I took a wedding planning class to learn those truths, and soon after, I started planning and designing weddings. In my years working with brides, I discovered that many of them had the same questions about weddings that I had. Which is why I set out to educate brides about all things wedding -- the good, the bad, and the ugly! So what exactly are some of these truths about wedding planning that you should know?  Photo by Dear Wesleyann, via Every Last DetailTruth #1: You get what you pay for. I know we hear this all the time in every aspect of life, and when it comes to weddings, it's not any different. Want an amazing photographer? Be ready to pay more than $1,000. Want everything to go smoothly on your wedding day? Well if you're paying experienced professionals, you most certainly can! As the saying goes, you can't expect champagne when you have a beer budget! Your budget is what it is, but just keep this tidbit in mind when you're evaluating the expectations that you have for your wedding. Truth #2: Planning a wedding takes a lot of time, and it's hard work! Sure, when you start planning your wedding, it's exciting and fun and new. You buy magazines, start looking at wedding dresses, scour blogs with tons of pretty images, and start dreaming up your wedding. But then you have a million appointments to go to. Payments to make. Schedules to create. People to organize. Emails to answer. There is a reason why there are wedding planners -- because wedding planning does in fact take a lot of time and work to keep everything organized! If you're prepared to take on something equivalent to a full-time job, then go for it. If you're perfectly happy with your own job (and busy with it too), then you should definitely think about hiring a wedding planner!  Photo by Gian Carlo Photography, via Every Last DetailTruth #3: Prices are not inflated just because of the word ""wedding"". I know there's that myth that floats around saying that services and products for weddings are expensive because the word ""wedding"" is associated with them. In fact, I used to believe it. The simple truth of the matter is that they're not. Going deeper into it, weddings are (usually) way more involved than your average birthday party or event. If it ever seems like something is priced higher than ""normal,"" it's because that person realizes that providing services/products for a wedding requires more than your normal event. And in reality, you are expecting your wedding to be better than a backyard birthday party, right? Truth #4: Inspiration is not replication. You don't have to replicate what you see on Pinterest or wedding blogs, do what you think is ""popular,"" or what your friends did. The main goal of Pinterest and wedding blogs is to inspire brides. Sure, it's great to be inspired by the ideas that you see, but know that you don't have to incorporate every single thing into your wedding. In fact, weddings have different styles, so it's okay to think mason jars are cute and not incorporate them into your modern wedding. You don't have to do something in particular at your wedding just because you think it's the thing to do, or because all of your friends did it. Details are wonderful, but they're even more wonderful when they're unique to you, and no one else. Get inspired, and then take a step back to infuse your personalities and your story into your details. Your wedding is your wedding, and it should be a reflection of you and your fiancé, not a reflection of the most popular wedding on the internet.  Photo by Ahava Studios, via Every Last DetailTruth #5: DIY isn't for everyone. Ah, the infamous DIY. It seems like just about everything is DIY nowadays, doesn't it? In my world, the ever-so-popular DIY in weddings should be seen as ""handmade"" as opposed to DIY -- because thanks to the advent of Etsy, oftentimes DIY items aren't actually created by the bride. To me, DIY is actually doing everything for your wedding. This means invitations, favors, setting up, hair and makeup, food, desserts -- everything. It's a huge undertaking, and it's most definitely not right for everyone. Even if you want to just DIY your favors -- I did that, and let me tell you... it takes way longer than you'll expect it to! Which is why DIY isn't for everyone. If you're crafty, and your friends and family are crafty, and they all want to lend a helping hand, then go for it. But if it's just you and your trusty craft supplies -- you may want to think twice about DIYing your wedding! So there you have it -- some very important truths about planning a wedding! Have any of you discovered anything opposite to these truths?"

The couple's only child, Samantha, is reportedly at the center of Perelman's court battle with his former in-laws. When Cohen died in 2007, Perelman was appointed executor of her estate, and Samantha, now 23, was listed as the main beneficiary. Since then, Perelman has filed at least four lawsuits on behalf of Cohen's estate against his ex-father-in-law, the late Robert Cohen, and his ex-brother-in-law, James, claiming the pair had cheated Samantha out of a share of the family's highly profitable media business. (The late Robert Cohen was the president of the Hudson County News Company.) According to DNAinfo.com, Perelman's former in-laws claim he has spent at least $20 million in litigation costs over the course of five years. They also claim that Perelman's real motivation for filing the lawsuits is to re-claim money he paid out in his divorce settlement with Claudia Cohen -- a reported $80 million, according to New York magazine.For more details on the case, head over to DNAinfo.

Still others like to travel as a family, to experience a new place and try new things together. Active travel is one of the best types of family trips because it offers a variety of benefits that regular travel does not. Here are five reasons why families love active travel - and why you'll never hear ""I'm Bored"" again!Great way to bond In our day to day lives, it's often challenging to get everyone in a family together at the same time. With everyone so busy with work, school, sports, and hobbies it often seems impossible to coordinate schedules and spend quality time as a whole family. Active travel is a great way to bring everyone together. Family members are able to catch up with one another without the usual distractions of daily life. What better way to reconnect than while canoeing down the Cher River, cycling through lavender fields, or zip lining over an adventure park?Never get bored As with most families, each member has their own preferences and enjoys different activities. Traditional travel sometimes makes it difficult to keep everyone happy and entertained. With active travel, there are so many things to do that nobody will get bored. Multisport tours blend biking, hiking, canoeing, via ferrata, ropes course and zip lining, just to name a few. Once you finish one activity, there's always something new to experience. Everyone in the family will enjoy the variety and excitement of participating in these adventures together.Still have time to relax Despite its name, active travel also allows plenty of time to relax and unwind. On self-guided active vacations, you're the boss. If you don't want to do something, you don't have to. There's always plenty of time in between activities to sit and eat, people watch or just take in the beauty of your surroundings. Take a break whenever you want, sit back and relax. At night, when all the fun and adventure has died down, unwind however you'd like. You manage your itinerary, so you call the shots.All ages can participate Because of the wide variety of activities, active travel is perfect for the whole family. Everyone can participate, from young children to grandparents! And, if something happens to be challenging for some family members, there is always something else they can try. There's so much to choose from, you're certain to find the right fit for your whole family.Different way to learn about the region Anyone can pick up a book and read about a destination, but to truly learn about the history and culture of a country you must experience it first-hand. Adventure travel opens the doors of discovery for families to explore and learn together. Visit the sites you've read about, talk to the local people, go to Renaissance festivals, and visit museums full of artifacts that are over hundreds of years old. It's like real, live history and geography lessons. And with the added bonus of active adventures, you'll be able to see the country in a different way than most average travelers do.Traveling as a family can be an amazing experience. Active travel makes this experience even more incredible by creating new ways to bond and learn about each other while truly discovering the destinations you visit. These are just a few of the countless reasons why families love active travel. What will your reasons be?"

8,WELLNESS,7 Ways Stress Affects Men's Health,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stress-mens-health-effects-impact_us_5b9d41d5e4b03a1dcc86005a,"Stress and anxiety could play a large role in male fertility, according to new research. Recent studies conducted in Italy",2013-06-16,Frustrated Businessman reading bad news on his digital tablet. Dark scene.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d41d52100003000c57327.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Men and women's average stress levels may be roughly on par with each other, but the physical and psychological toll of long-term stress on men and women is quite different.In addition to the numerous health impacts of stress experienced by both sexes, tension and anxiety can also take a unique toll on the male mind and body, starting with the immediate stress response. While stress tends to activate the ""tend and befriend"" response in women, men have been found to react to stress more with the aggressive ""fight or flight"" response, according to one study.""When the fight or flight response is activated [in both sexes], our bodies go into emergency mode and take care of immediate and acute needs, focusing on getting energy to the muscles, and we don't take care of the longer-term needs of the body,"" Christy Matta, MA, author of ""The Stress Response,"" tells the Huffington Post. ""We shut down things like our immune systems, reproductive systems ... It does suppress the release of testosterone and it suppresses other reproductive systems. The wear and tear on the body is severe from repeated stress."" So in honor of National Men's Health Week (which concludes on Father's Day this Sunday), scroll through the list below for seven important health reasons for men to de-stress. 1. Decreased Facial AttractivenessThe male hormone testosterone has been linked with a strong immune system and facial attractiveness in men. A University of Aberdeen study in which women ranked the attractiveness of 94 men found that those with higher testosterone and lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol had higher immune system responses, and were deemed the most attractive, Health.com reported. Men with higher cortisol levels, in turn, were deemed less attractive. Cortisol, the study suggests, may play a role in blocking testosterone's appeal to potential mates. 2. Early Heart Disease Risk As A Result Of Inherited StressAn extensive body of research has established that stress is a risk factor in the development of heart disease, and inherited stress can also increase the risk of early heart disease. Recently, a Henry Ford Hospital study found that men with a family history of heart disease had a diagnosis of heart disease an average of 12 years earlier than those without a family history. They were also more likely to have a higher stress symptom score (an evaluation based on worry, impatience, anger and other symptoms) than men without a family history of heart disease -- suggesting that the propensity to get stressed may be, to some degree, inherited. “Depression and stress are known risk factors for heart disease, and they both have strong heritibility,” lead author Mark W. Ketterer, Ph.D., of Henry Ford Hospital’s Department of Behavioral Health, said in a press release. “None of the other risk factors, including high cholesterol, high blood pressure or diabetes, were shown to have a significant familial link in this group. Therefore, it’s likely that men who have an early onset of heart disease might have a genetic predisposition to stress, which causes the heart disease.”3. Leaves A Mark On Sperm & Offspring DevelopmentHere's a big incentive for future fathers to start de-stressing now: Research in animals suggests that chronic stress could result in gene expression changes to dad's sperm -- and those changes could manifest in his offspring in the form of a muted reaction to stress. ""It didn't matter if dads were going through puberty or in adulthood when stressed before they mated. We've shown here for the first time that stress can produce long-term changes to sperm that reprogram the offspring HPA stress axis regulation,"" lead researcher Tracy L. Bale, Ph.D., said in a university press release. ""These findings suggest one way in which paternal-stress exposure may be linked to such neuropsychiatric diseases.""4. Accelerates Prostate Cancer Development. A recent study on mice found chronic stress to accelerate the development of prostate cancer, suggesting that prostate cancer patients could benefit from stress reduction as part of their treatment.University of California studies have demonstrated that stress management can yield positive results in men with prostate cancer. 5. Erectile Dysfunction. According to WebMD, 10 to 20 percent of all cases of erectile dysfunction (ED) are linked to psychological factors like stress, anxiety and depression.  Robert M. Sapolsky, Ph.D., professor of neurology at Stanford, explained that turning on the parasympathetic nervous system (also known as the ""relax and renew"" system) is essential for arousal -- but when we're stressed, we're operating from the sympathetic nervous system (""fight or flight"").""You have trouble having an erection in the first place because you can't establish that parasympathetic tone,"" said Sapolsky in a 2012 talk for the Science of a Meaningful Life series. ""[Or] you manage to have an erection ... and you accelerate the transition from parasympathetic to sympathetic, and the whole thing goes too quickly.""6. Lower Sperm Count. Stress and anxiety could play a large role in male fertility, according to new research. Recent studies conducted in Italy, as reported by Reuters Health, found that men who were stressed ejaculated less and had a lower sperm count and concentration than those who were not under stress. Stress was also positively correlated with deformed and less mobile sperm. 7. Social Withdrawl. The stereotype of the ""strong and silent type"" may actually be a picture of the male stress response. A 2010 University of Southern California study found that men who are stressed out exhibit less activity in the brain regions associated with understanding others' feelings. When placed under acute stress, the men had less of a brain response to facial expressions, especially fear and anger, whereas women had greater activity in these brain regions.“These are the first findings to indicate that sex differences in the effects of stress on social behavior extend to one of the most basic social transactions -- processing someone else’s facial expression,” Mara Mather, director of the Emotion and Cognition Lab at USC, said in a press release. “Under stress, men tend to withdraw socially while women seek emotional support.""Both men and women can benefit from scientifically-proven stress busters like running, yoga, meditation or deep breathing.
