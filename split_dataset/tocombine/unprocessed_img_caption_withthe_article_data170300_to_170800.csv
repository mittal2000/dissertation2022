1,BLACK VOICES,"Jordan Davis Shooting Result Of Florida's Gun Laws, Opponents Say",Janell Ross,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jordan-davis-shooting_us_5badcde2e4b0bb1705fae6ba,"“Jordan Davis’ tragic death is the classic example of the problem with concealed carry,” said Rand. “We have looked at enough",2012-12-02,"This undated photo provided by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office shows Michael David Dunn, 45, who is charged with murder and attempted murder in the Nov. 23 shooting at a Jacksonville, Fla., gas station. Dunn parked beside a sport utility vehicle 17-year-old Jordan Davis was riding in with three other young men and told them to turn the music down, police said. Dunn exchanged words with Davis, who was in the back seat, and started firing, later telling police he felt threatened. (AP Photo/Jacksonville Sheriff's Office)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badcde2240000500054c0c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Saturday, Lucia McBath and Ron Davis buried their 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis.That Davis was killed after an exchange about loud music is not in dispute. Neither is the fact that Michael David Dunn, 45, fired eight to nine shots into the red SUV where Davis and three friends were sitting outside a Jacksonville, Fla., gas station, striking Davis twice.Dunn has been charged with murder and attempted murder in connection with the Nov. 23 incident, entered a plea of not guilty and remains in a Florida jail. But in claiming that he fired after seeing, in the words of his lawyer, “four black men” and a shotgun that police never found emerging from one of the vehicle’s rear windows, Dunn has raised the specter of a defense centered around Florida’s now-infamous Stand Your Ground law. The policy offers criminal and civil legal protections to individuals who use deadly force to defend themselves if and when they feel threatened. It's at the heart of volunteer neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman’s explanation for his decision to shoot another black 17-year-old boy, Trayvon Martin, in February.That two black boys have been shot and killed in one state in the span of just nine months, by a pair of men who described the unarmed teens as threatening, amounts to more than a geographic coincidence, gun control advocates say. Florida is a virtual laboratory for policies supported by gun-rights activists. Public records indicate that Florida has licensed nearly 1 million people who do not work in law enforcement or security -– more than any other state in the country -– to carry a concealed weapon since its program began in the late 1980s. And thanks to the state’s Stand Your Ground law, many feel legally empowered to use them in a broad and far too nebulous set of circumstances, according to gun control advocates. “Florida is like the Wild Wild West,” said Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Washington-based Violence Policy Center, a gun control organization.Hours before Ron Davis buried his son, he made a similar point.“I still believe to this day, unless the gentleman tells me different, that it was anger involved and having the accessibility of a gun,” Davis told CNN.Neither Davis nor his ex-wife, McBath, could be reached for comment Friday or Saturday. The family’s lawyer told The Huffington Post in an email that both he and the family would remain unavailable until after the burial. Dunn’s attorney also declined a request for comment.The Violence Policy Center tracks shooting deaths caused by concealed carry permit holders around the country. Between May 2007 and November 2012, 499 people have been killed by permit holders, according to the organization’s database. That figure includes 14 law enforcement officers, 23 people killed during mass shootings and 35 incidents of murder-suicide.It also includes Jordan Davis and 22 other people killed in Florida, according to the center’s records. “Jordan Davis’ tragic death is the classic example of the problem with concealed carry,” said Rand. “We have looked at enough of these cases to see this mindset that concealed carry seems to create. You see that pattern over and over and over again -- people get into an altercation over a parking space or just garden-variety disputes that then escalate. Things just get all the more intense when that’s combined with Stand Your Ground.”Gun-rights advocates say rolling back gun laws like Stand Your Ground and concealed carry would have far-reaching consequences and restrict Americans' Second Amendment rights in ways the framers never intended. They also argue that arming more of the nation’s law-abiding citizens will serve as a powerful deterrent for criminals. A 2004 National Academy of Sciences study found no definitive evidence that increased gun ownership reduces crime. Like most Southern states, Florida boasts a robust gun culture. In the northern and middle parts of the state, gun collecting, hunting and shooting are cherished pastimes and viewed as rites of passage. Jacksonville investigators have described Dunn as a gun collector.The last three fiscal years have been the busiest on record for the Florida Department of Agriculture staffers who process concealed carry permits, said Ken Wilkinson, assistant division director for licensing. Both there and across the country, interest in purchasing guns appears to be surging.“This is not my personal opinion here, but something that I see and hear a lot of,"" said Wilkinson. “It seems a lot of people think Obama is going to take their guns.”The FBI received 283,423 background check requests during the three-day weekend after Thanksgiving, part of the process to purchase a gun in most retail stores, said Stephen Fischer, a spokesman for the bureau. That's up from 2011’s record high of 215,192 requests over the same three-day periodOn Nov. 23, the day that Davis was killed in Jacksonville, the FBI processed 154,873 background checks submitted by gun sellers across the country, making it the busiest day since the program began in November 1998.What’s happening in Florida and other parts of the country did not develop organically, Rand said. In 1987, Florida passed the nation’s first “shall issue” and concealed carry permit laws, giving anyone who can pass a background check and meet other requirements on the state’s two-page application the guaranteed right to bear a secret arm.Florida charted new territory again in 2005, when it passed the nation’s first Stand Your Ground law. The policy represented a shift away from what had long been a standard of self-defense law: the right to defend oneself from threats in the home. Instead, it freed Florida residents to respond to threats anywhere.“I think it’s safe to say that Marion Hammer and the NRA had a lot to do with it,” said Rand. ” She gets whatever she wants down there.”Hammer, who in the 1990s became the first woman appointed president of the National Rifle Association, has spent much of the past three decades building relationships and wrangling with state policymakers in Florida. In 2005, she was inducted into the state's Women's Hall of Fame.Hammer could not be reached for comment Saturday. A woman who answered the phone at Hammer’s home and identified herself as her daughter said that her mother’s health is failing and she is no longer in a position to grant interviews. The NRA did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Friday and Saturday.Hammer is said to have provided the language that formed the basis of Florida's Stand Your Ground law, first introduced by state Rep. Dennis Baxley in the House of Representatives. Then-state Sen. Marco Rubio, now a U.S. senator, helped get the bill through Florida's other legislative chamber.The language Hammer provided for the bill also became part of model legislation suggested to conservative lawmakers in states around the country who are or were members of the American Legislative Council, better known as ALEC. Since 2005, 25 states have joined Florida in passing Stand Your Ground laws. Every state but Illinois now has a concealed carry law on the books.In August, Hammer told the Tampa Bay Times that the NRA will push for a bill in 2013 allowing gun owners to openly carry their weapons in Florida."

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2df082400003100973025.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sarah N. LynchWASHINGTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Outgoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro delayed immediately implementing a rule to lift a ban on broader-based advertising for private placements in part because she feared it would tarnish her legacy as a pro-investor leader of the agency, internal SEC emails obtained by a U.S. House of Representatives oversight panel show.The emails were highlighted in a letter critical of Schapiro sent to her on Friday by congressman Patrick McHenry, the Republican chairman of a prominent House subcommittee that oversees financial services, who called on Schapiro to hurry up and finalize the rule.Schapiro, who is stepping down as chairman in two weeks, decided to take more time seeking public comments about the rule after Barbara Roper, a well-known investor advocate with the Consumer Federation of America, wrote a letter to Schapiro's chief of staff voicing ""strong objections"" to lifting the ban without vetting the rule first.Schapiro's decision went against the recommendations of the SEC's staff, including Corporation Finance Director Meredith Cross, the emails suggest.It also angered Republican SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher, who told Schapiro he was ""furious"" and accused her of failing to negotiate with other commissioners in good faith, according to an email included in McHenry's letter.After changing her mind on the direction of the rule-making, she only informed Commissioner Elisse Walter - her close friend who is taking over the chairmanship this month - and no other member of the SEC until the following week, the letter says.""I don't want to be tagged with an anti-investor legacy,"" Schapiro wrote in an e-mail to Cross with the subject line ""Please don't forward.""""In light of all that's been accomplished, that wouldn't be fair, but it is what will be said ...""McHenry said Schapiro's concerns about her legacy shouldn't delay implementation of the rule.""The continued second-guessing, and the accompanying delays in the process, is simply unacceptable,"" McHenry wrote.The SEC issued a statement in response to reporters seeking a comment about the McHenry letter.""Chairman Schapiro strongly believes that protecting investors should be the desired legacy of all SEC Chairmen,"" the SEC said. ""It is part of our mission and should inform our decisions at all times. She (Schapiro) also believes that the agency should not consider investors - or the groups that represent them - to be special interests."" INVESTOR PROTECTIONSThe SEC's proposal would greatly loosen strict advertising rules to make it easier for hedge funds, private equity funds and other firms to reach potential investors in the private marketplace.The proposal pertains to several kinds of offerings, including those made under what is known as ""Rule 506"" of Regulation D, which allows companies to raise an unlimited dollar amount from accredited investors who meet certain income or asset thresholds.Proponents say it will help spur more capital-raising and makes a lot of sense - especially in a social media world.The SEC was required by Congress to lift the advertising ban under the 2012 Jumpstart our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act.The JOBS Act aims to reduce the regulatory burden for small business start-ups by relaxing various securities regulations.The law passed with bipartisan support, though shortly before it was enacted Schapiro wrote a lengthy letter raising concerns it could erode many important investor protections.Consumer advocates and state regulators are afraid it will leave the door open to fraud by people who will be able to peddle products to unsuspecting investors.The SEC was supposed to finalize the rule by July 4, but missed its deadline. Originally, staff had wanted to bypass the lengthier public comment process by adopting it as an ""interim final rule"" instead of a ""proposed"" rule. That would have let the SEC lift the ban right away, and then potentially tweak the rule down the road.Roper and other investor advocates, however, strongly opposed that approach, saying important protections need to be added to the rule. Schapiro later dropped the plan for an interim final rule and took the longer route of seeking public comments first.The SEC said late Saturday that it sought public comments first because there was a ""high level of investor interest and numerous requests to be able to comment on a specific proposal."" The SEC added that there could have been a ""very real threat of a legal challenge"" if the agency did not go through a more rigorous rule-making process.Investor advocates are still upset with the draft of the proposed rule because they say none of their suggestions for improving the rule were even contemplated, such as amending the definition of ""accredited investor"" to make sure unsophisticated people are not sold or marketed unsuitable products, and tweaking the filing rules so the commission can collect data on solicitation practices to help it police the marketplace.Democratic SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar has called for re-proposing it, and incoming SEC Chairman Walter has also raised concerns about a lack of investor protections.Republicans in the U.S. House and at the SEC, however, want to see the rule go into effect right away.

The company has been in discussions with HMRC for some time and is also in talks with The Treasury,"" she added.The company, the largest coffee chain in the world, with a market value of $39 billion, said it would release more details later this week.The Public Accounts Committee, which grilled Alstead and managers from Google and Amazon over their tax planning, is due to release its report on corporate taxation in the UK on Monday."

As AFP notes, McAfee's website had been launched by the tech pioneer to ""counter what he sees as erroneous claims by the media or authorities about him."" It had previously promised to provide more information about McAfee when ""it became available.""However, despite the recent blog post, the Daily Mail reports that McAfee may not be in police custody. Belize national police ""confirmed"" to the news website on Sunday that the ""whereabouts of the multimillionaire software developer are still unknown.""McAfee has been on the lam since Nov. 11, when a neighbor he had allegedly been ""quarreling with"" was found dead, lying face up in a pool of blood, in San Pedro, Belize. The man's body was found in his own home. According to a police report, 52-year-old Gregory Faull was shot in the back of the head; his laptop and iPhone were reported missing, but there had reportedly been no evidence that anyone had broken in. Faull, like McAfee, was an American expatriate living in Belize. As an earlier report by The Huffington Post notes, Belizian authorities believe that McAfee may be linked to Faull's murder, and police have said that the software mogul is needed for questioning and is a ""person of interest"" in the case.McAfee has ""disputed any connection to the crime,"" however, telling the media that he believes police will torture and kill him if he is captured.""They will kill me if they find me,” he told Wired in an earlier interview. However, though McAfee has been on the run for weeks, he has been anything but invisible. The New York Times writes,Asserting his innocence, Mr. McAfee became a multiplatform cyberdissident, with a Twitter account, and a blog at whoismcafee.com with audio links, a comments section, photographs and a stream of invective against the government and the police of Belize. He has done interviews on podcasts, like the “Joe Rogan Experience,” and offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of “the person or persons” who killed Mr. Faull. He has turned lamming it into a kind of high-tech performance art.On his blog, for example, McAfee has described the elaborate steps he has taken to evade capture. ""He has contended...that when the authorities searched his house in the days after the murder, he hovered nearby in preposterous-sounding disguises, including that of a drunk German tourist in a Speedo and 'a distasteful, oversized Hawaiian shirt,'"" according to the Times.McAfee has also described an elaborate disguise that included shoving ""a shaved down tampon deep into [his] right nostril."" He has allegedly also adopted a number of other personas, including that of a native vendor selling tamales and burritos.Though McAfee has claimed that he had ""no choice but to flee because police and politicians in Belize are corrupt and eager to kill him,"" some McAfee watchers argue that the man has ""grown paranoid and perhaps psychotic after months of experimenting with and consuming MDPV, a psychoactive drug,"" the Times reports.McAfee has reportedly been living in Belize for the last four years.

Movies and animated specials are filled with images of fluffy snow falling on top of villages adorned with spectacular Christmas displays. Even commercials are full of happy shoppers bopping around during snow storms, but no one even seems to be cold or have wet feet. Christmas cards all look like scenes from Normal Rockwell paintings, and we reminisce about how it used to snow more when we were younger while admitting we hope that it snows for Christmas this year.For the remainder of the winter, which is when the majority of snow falls, I might add, we go back to our snow-hating ways. We hate the cold, and we complain of fussing with boots, hats, and scarves. We don't want to deal with travel delays associated with the weather, and, in fact, we often plan a cruise to the Caribbean or a week in Cancun. We hope for an early end to winter, and complain if the flakes continue to fall in March or April.I've written about our tendency to want to split winter into two seasons before, as well as whether Charles Dickens is responsible for our obsession with the idea of a White Christmas.Finally, here are some images that show the snow on the ground for the past three Christmas days (images courtesy of the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center).

Yet his photographs of dolls themselves are not so forgiving.Far from the gloss of celebrity glamor, Rolston's photographs of ventriloquist dummies show the crackled paint and decayed wood that has phased the physical faces themselves, though not the smiles painted upon them. Rolston, who was discovered by Andy Warhol, snapped 100 dummies at the Vent Haven Museum in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky.There is an eerie beauty to the silenced puppets, their expressions somewhere between entertaining and grotesque. Rolston captures the dummies' ""head shots"" straight on against a white background, treating the wooden dolls as stars of another era. While the beauty of Hollywood's most stunning starlets will eventually fade, these ventriloquist dummies forever keep smiling, although this eternal existence is far from beautiful. The photographs are compiled in the book ""Talking Heads, The Vent Haven Portraits,"" which we predict would catalyze superbly bizarre coffee table small talk. What do you think of these creepy talking heads? Let us know in the comments."

Moving towards zero HIV infections, zero AIDS related deaths and zero discrimination will require community solidarity, along with public and private partners working together to encourage and foster progress in HIV/AIDS education, prevention, treatment and care. Since the theme's inception in 2011, numerous challenges such as war, terrorism, natural disasters and economic calamities have pushed for community and governments' prioritizing, while HIV funding has been hit with continued cuts, which assist to exacerbate the debilitating effects of HIV and the mortality rate of AIDS. All has not been lost in the desperate fight to bring relief to a people (black) disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. In the year 2012 ""Ending AIDS"" has become the prophetic call to community. As we turn the tide of this pandemic together, ""Ending AIDS"" is a ""war cry"" from the bowels of love demanding the passionate and compassionate merging of gifts, talents and skills within communities to overcome that (AIDS) which has already taken so much of God's precious life from us. With all the great medical strides gained through research, improving the quality of care and treatments, one would assume all populations' numbers would decline. Data acquired from The Henry I. Kaiser Family Foundation HIV/AIDS Policy Fact Sheet shows black Americans have been ""disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS since the epidemic's beginning, and that disparity has deepened over time."" Blacks account for more new HIV infections, AIDS diagnoses, people estimated to be living with HIV disease, and HIV related deaths than any other racial/ethic group in the U.S. Today, there are approximately 1.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S., including approximately 545,000 who are Blacks in the U.S.Since the beginning of AIDS, faith's hands have played an incredible role in healing and restoration, and as pastors and congregants become more informed and take the necessary actions to be empowered to prevent the transmission and/or spread of AIDS, the number of hands belonging to faith will increase, and the community will be better for it. The church is a cornerstone of black community, and as communities of faith increases their HIV/AIDS knowledge base and engage the process to end AIDS, so shall we see a significant decline in transmission rates for black people.Slowly but surely, 30-plus years into the AIDS pandemic, we are witnessing tenacity, strength and resilience unfold in our ranks. These qualities are entrenched in our history, for at the core of the black struggle is the absolute capacity to overcome and survive against the odds. In the early days of the epidemic, those qualities lacked in the fight against AIDS for many communities, including institutions of faith, as many still are paralyzed by HIV stigma. With federal, state, city and local budgets strained by deficits, without passionate and strategic planning and advocacy, it is difficult for many leaders to prioritize HIV/AIDS prevention, education, services, care and treatment. There are only a few entities responding to this health crisis with the urgency it warrants. Collaborative partnerships within community neighborhoods are proving to be the way to maximize efficacy and capacity to fulfill the mission of meeting the needs of the community. An example of such a successful collaborative partnership is the one forged between Love Alive International Foundation, Watchful Eye, Intersections of the Triad , Brooklyn Medical Plaza, Black Veterans for Social Justice, Benjamin Banner High School, and MOCADA Museum -- all located in Brooklyn working together to make services more available and accessible, while successfully maximizing resources for the greater impact of meeting the community needs, as they fulfill their perspective missions."
