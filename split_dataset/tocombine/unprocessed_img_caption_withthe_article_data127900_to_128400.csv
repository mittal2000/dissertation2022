We trust that our meat is pathogen-free, and that raw fruits and vegetables won't make us sick. We tend to believe that something labeled ""all-natural"" comes from a small farm that uses no chemicals. And we tell ourselves that the FDA and USDA would never pull the wool over our eyes if something were amiss.Unfortunately, food laws are significantly more complicated than that. Below are some shocking facts that will make you think twice about the safety of our food system.Clarification: Slide 8 of the above slideshow has been edited to reflect that foods can bear a ""zero trans fats"" label, as opposed to ""no trans fats."""
1,PARENTING,Baby Acting Crazy? It's Probably a Case of JBBB,"Claire Zulkey, Contributor
Freelance writer, blogger at Zulkey.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baby-acting-crazy-its-probably-a-case-of-jbbb_us_5b9dade9e4b03a1dcc8b594d,"Some parenting books are useful, but the danger of too much information is giving parents the impression that there's very much that's in their control.",2014-02-24,Their Baby Cuteness Doesn't Predict Adult Attractiveness ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b03bb26000036007ef76b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"When you become a parent, you spend a lot of time filling your head with strange acronyms and code. VBAC, for instance, means delivering a baby vaginally after you've already had a C-section. The 6 S's is some B.S. that's allegedly guaranteed to make your kid sleep like an angel. DH (when used on message boards) means ""dear husband"" (I assume sarcastically). And a good one that's made the rounds recently is the CTFD method of parenting (as in, Calm the F Down, and that applies to parents, not kids).I've been using one with my friends that I invented that is in a somewhat similar vein. I used it yesterday and someone said they wished it was Googleable, so here it is: JBBB. It stands for Just Babies Being Babies. Why does my son sleep for 20 minutes one nap and three hours the next? JBBB. Why does he love grapes one week and then scream and throw them on the floor the next week? JBBB. Why does he say the word ""thank you"" so cutely 3,000 times in a row and then stop when I take out my camera? JBBB. Why does he act like I'm trying to slowly torture him when I'm just trying to get him three blocks home in the car? JBBB. JBBMFGDB, man.Some parenting books are useful, but the danger of too much information is giving parents the impression that there's very much that's in their control. Especially with sleeping! I think it's incredibly mean to give new, sleep-deprived parents the impression that ""If you didn't do this your kid would sleep through the night,"" or ""If you start doing this other thing, your kid will sleep through the night."" This gives parents with ""uncooperative"" children the impression that they're doing something wrong, and, maybe even worse, gives parents who were lucky enough to have easygoing kids the impression that they had something to do with it.It's probably just a matter of convenience, but it truly helps me to remember that babies and young children are, basically, tiny insane people who make absolutely no sense. This is where JBBB comes into play. It's both an explanation and a comfort. Your kid's a snot-nosed, screaming, destructive, uncooperative, unrestful piece of crap despite your best efforts to engage, encourage, comfort, nurture and guide him? Whatever, dude. Have a beer. JBBB. Say it out loud. J.B.B.B. What can you do? Not much. J to the B to the B to the final B. It will set you free.Also on HuffPost:"

Peter Hoffman, chef/owner of NYC's Back Forty, is confident that the restaurant's cassoulet tasting event on March 9 will add delicious twists to the old favorite.""The French have elevated cassoulet to mythical status, but expect many versions of the dish at this year's walk-around tasting. Look for a version with lentils and fire-roasted pork, an Asturian version called Fabada with the superlative Iberian bean, fabes alubias, a version brimming with Brooklyn Cured meats, and our home entry from Back Forty with Chef Mike Laarhoven's smoked lamb belly, andouille sausage, and duck confit,"" says Hoffman.Laarhoven is one of six chefs taking part, and he's not surprised that the tasting is so popular among chefs and diners alike. ""I think cassoulet endures for several reasons,"" he says. ""The most obvious is that it's a beautiful, warm, stick-to-your-bones winter meal that can incorporate so many of our favorite foods. It's allowance for variation is important, which is really what our cassoulet event is about. It means something personal to so many people--who doesn't remember tasting their first cassoulet?""So what does Laarhoven expect to see from the other chefs?

4,FOOD & DRINK,The 'Mistake' That Leads to Better Brownies,"Epicurious, Contributor

I rarely follow a recipe -- even my own -- without tinkering with it. One of my current favorites to play with is my Best Friends Forever Brownies, which I developed in 2011 for the re-imagined frozen dinner of my dreams. Those brownies were thick for food photography reasons. Since then I've been making slimmer, sleeker brownies by doubling the batter, skipping the nuts, sprinkling it with a little flaky Maldon sea salt, and baking it in a large (18- by 13-inch) rimmed baking sheet -- known in the trade as a half-sheet pan -- much to the delight of friends and colleagues.Recently I was baking a batch and took it out a bit early to test for doneness; I wanted to be sure I didn't over-bake the batter. The brownies weren't anywhere near done, but instead of sliding the pan back in the oven, I absentmindedly left the pan out and raced from the room to deal with something else. When I discovered my mistake about 15 minutes later, I simply popped the pan back in the oven and finished cooking them.The reaction I got to the brownies the next day was better than ever. One young woman asked for the recipe, so I explained how I'd adapted the BFF brownies, leaving out what I assumed was my dumb mistake. The next day she reported back that hers weren't as moist and fudgy as she'd remembered mine to be from my recent batch.SEE MORE: Fudgy Brownie Thins With Sea SaltCurious as to whether I'd stumbled upon a happy accident, I made another batch, repeating the earlier mistake and leaving the half-baked batter out on the counter for 15 minutes before finishing it off in the oven. Bingo! The brownies really were fudgier, a fact confirmed by my colleagues, who by this time were seriously into -- and thoroughly enjoying -- their role as guinea pigs.Intrigued by the why behind my positive results to a most unorthodox baking method, I emailed Harold McGee, author of On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen, for his take on the topic:""The 15-minute respite is allowing both brownies and pan to cool down, so when you put them back in the oven, it takes some minutes for them to get back up to temperature before they can continue to cook and become more done. And the outer portions will end up less hot than they would with continuous cooking, and so will provide less carryover heat to the insides after you take them out of the oven the second time. So I think you probably end up cooking them less thoroughly in the same in-oven time, and that's why they end up moister.""I panicked when I read, ""cooking them less thoroughly"" and quickly emailed McGee again. He replied, ""I'm pretty sure that you're still reaching microbe-killing temperatures inside the brownies, though if that's a major concern I would just make sure with an instant-read thermometer."" I did and the finished brownies went way beyond the food-safe temperature of 160 degrees F, getting up to over 190 degrees F.And McGee's right about the ""outer portions."" Most get overcooked and crusty, but these brownies are as fudgy along the edges as they are in the center. Don't believe me? You'll just have to try them for yourself!See more from Epicurious: The Best Chicken Wings in AmericaAn Insider's Guide to Eating in New YorkTop 10 Pizzas in America The Great American Taco"

The Chicago Tribune reported that Ramis experienced complications related to vasculitis in 2010 after developing an infection. He then experienced a relapse of vasculitis in 2011. Autoimmune vasculitis is a rare condition where white blood cells, which are part of the immune system, attack the walls of the body's own blood vessels. When this happens, the vessels become inflamed and can swell, according to the University of North Carolina Health Care Kidney Center. When the blood vessels become inflamed, blood flow can be blocked or limited, leading to weakening and bulging of the blood vessel. When this happens, the limited blood flow to organs in the body can lead to damage to the organs, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute reported.While the condition can be treated with medications and steroids, it can come back, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Then the sad individual gets help, sees the world in color and has a dog run into frame to play with them, or they are suddenly on the couch petting their beloved cat. Well, there's a reason for that, pets can help individuals with depression/illnesses/anxiety. ""Pets offer an unconditional love that can be very helpful to people with depression,"" says Ian Cook, MD, a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA. Depression affects millions of individuals in the USA alone. A lot of people reading this suffer from some form or know someone who does. A pet might not be right for everyone, so don't just show up with a pet one day for someone you know with depression.  The first thought that enters many heads is ""I can barely take care of myself, a pet would be a mistake."" Well, with great pets, comes great responsibility. Depression studies have shown responsibility promotes mental health. ""Taking care of a pet can help give you a sense of your own value and importance,"" says Cook. It will remind you that you are capable -- that you can do more than you might think."" You still may be arguing that you can't even get out of bed or off the couch, well that won't fly (unless you get a bird, in which case let it fly around). Pets add routine to your life, you want be able to stay in bed till 2 pm or lay on the couch till 11:30, pets have a schedule and they will help you schedule your life again. You'll have to get up to feed them, let them out, play with them, walk them, feed them again. Pets get you off your butt and moving again. Depression has a strongest weapon, and that weapon is isolation. It will pull you back from your friends and family, you'll dodge calls/texts/snapchats/IM all of it. Leaving you to question all your thoughts alone, that is when depression strikes hardest. Pets offer the opposite of isolation, they bring companionship. A dog will never leave you alone, in a good way. My dogs run up to me all day throwing toys at me, laying on me, whine until I pick them up. I'm never alone, and I love my pets for that. I have woken up at 3 am to one of my dogs throwing a football at my head, meaning its play time now. Having a pet means you're never alone, even when you shut the door to go to the bathroom in peace, your pet will barge in ""You watch me go, why can't I watch you go?"" Pets give us routine, keeping us active, dogs have the added benefit of being brought on walks, or to dog parks. This exercise of taking your pet out promotes physical activity which in turn promotes mental and physical health. Walks help you lose weight, get you out of your depressing house which you've been cooped up in for far too long and also lets your pet relieve themselves with no shame. Say you're walking your dog or bring them to the dog park, well there's a good chance someone's going to come up to you to ask to pet your dog or ask what kind of breed they are, your dog will encourage you to interact socially. You may be shy or anxious or still feel alone, but guaranteed your dog will get attention and thus bring the interaction to you. So long isolation, hello social butterfly wonder dog. You may hate talking about yourself or not care what others say but pet owners love talking about their pets like children, and it's safe to say if you have a pet you like pets in general, so you'll go ahead and converse about them. Let your pet shine.  If I'm not petting one dog I'm petting the other, if I'm not scratching a friends cat behind the ears them I'm scratching another. Studies show that people feel better when they have physical contact with others. Petting a cat and listening to them purr soothes you, rubbing your dogs belly and watching their leg kick also relaxes you. You're no longer sitting in the house just lying there, you have someone to touch, to talk to, to interact with. Finally, there's laughter, endless laughter. Depressions got you down well your pet with 100% certainty will make you laugh. I've had my dogs fart on me when I've gone to pick them up and the sound scares them so they run away, one of them fell off my bed in the middle of the night while dreaming and got right back up with his tail wagging like it was the best dream ever. Depression makes you think about everything that has gone wrong and everything that can go wrong over and over again until you can take it no more. These little moments with pets that make you laugh make a world of difference. You may laugh as your cat chases a laser pointer around your house trying to catch the blasted red dot, or as they randomly fall asleep anywhere they like, like upside down on top of a loaf of a bread, the point being that though they are pets they have more empathy than we could ever dream.  The hardest step is getting up and seeking help and once you do that, take your pet for a walk or pet them, anything to get your mind on track a little more. Pets may not cure depression, but they certainly can help calm you.Rescue Idiot"
