I've only been there once but I've been interested in the continent and its culture since I was a boy. There is little wrong with an island that is the size of the U.S. and has about 25 million inhabitants, and most of them live along the coast. Australia presents itself to outsiders like a gigantic national park with gleaming cities along its perimeter. Storm Across the Great Southern On a motorcycle ride across the continent from Perth to Sydney, the recurrent notion I had was that I was touring a country that had the charms of 1950s America and the technological benefits of the 21st century. There did not appear to be litter along any roadside and every community, regardless of its size, was freshly painted and neatly trimmed. The weeks I was in Oz may have been the longest I've gone in decades without seeing graffiti on buildings. Norman Rockwell might have put on canvas idyllic towns like Esperance and Oyster Bay and Clare and Lorne. They seemed to me to reflect what has always been attractive about America but has since been lost in a crowd of people and buildings and traffic and franchised homogenization. The lifestyle and much of the culture is connected by economic and emotional tissues to the landscape. Australians view the countryside and every horizon as communal property and when they are rolling across the Outback and see a track leading into the bush, they are comfortable turning and following it to a watering hole or a place to camp. ""No Trespassing"" and ""Trespassers Will Be Shot,"" which are common phrases posted on American property lines, are all but unknown down under. Even in the parkscape cities like Perth, which decorates a grassy rise between the mouth of the Swan River to the east and the Indian Ocean to the West, the highways out of town on weekends are busy with loaded Utes and caravans bound for the bush or the Karri forests or the Stirling Ranges or the Leeuwin Peninsula.I spent my first night sleeping under the Southern Cross in a campground near the Leeuwin lighthouse on the rocky peninsula that separates the Indian from the Southern Ocean. Putting along the dirt track on the motorcycle after sundown with a tent and a bag and a computer and clothes I noticed the Aussies appeared to have settled in for the summer months of January and February close to the banks of the Blackwood River. Families had erected tents the size of small houses around fire pits and pickups and trailers were stacked with folding chairs, kayaks, barbecues, generators, cots, ice chests, and anything to sustain their long days under the southern sun. There was no loud music or pleading drunks. Instead, I heard the distant surf and the laughter of children playing in the lowering darkness and saw stars wheeling up from out toward the Nullarboor Plain.  Lean Smart or Get WetThe trip east along the southern tier of the Australian continent was rich with epic geography and botanical beauty. The road curling between giant Karri trees in the Margaret River Valley was a smooth tarmac enclosed by the tallest hardwoods growing on the planet and down near Esperance there were mountains rising up out of the ocean and inexpensive bungalows set along the palisades with views that might cost tens of millions in Malibu or Monterrey. I assumed this was what Southern California must have looked like before the arrival of the condo builders and the road pavers. Australia has more dirt track than sealed roadbed but riding it alone is a risky proposition. A mechanical malfunction or a minor accident could turn fatal because cell signals do not always reach the best places to ride. The Nullarbor was afire in late January. Brush was burning and the winds were moving it southward. The famous 90-mile stretch of straight road lay ahead but this was Australian Independence Day and I had envisioned several cold, cleansing ales at an isolated roadhouse in the Outback. Unfortunately, there was only a gravel camp site and a sign on the showers that all snakes in the area were poisonous and that it was important to close the door to keep them from ""slithering"" into the bathrooms, and I had not even zipped up my tent. There were no beer-addled drunken blokes to sing ""Waltzing Matilda"" with and the pub featured cheap Formica and a vinyl floor with plastic chairs at wobbly tables. Oddly, near the front door, propped up on an easel, there sat a large plastic poster with graphic depictions of ""The Spiders of Australia."" I had a beer and then went back to check again that I had zipped up my tent.Coming down off the Nullarboor, the proprietor of a petrol station introduced a baby kangaroo, a ""Joey"" that he had rescued while out cruising around in the bush with his four-wheeler. They are even stranger creatures when they are tiny. A hot wind followed the BMW down the Ayre Peninsula but there were oysters at Coffin Bay and by nightfall the next day bottles of local vintage wines were popped in the Clare Valley.  Little Lost JoeyWalking across the campground, I was greeted by a slender, gray-haired man with a bit of a limp. ""How's yer ride goin', yank?""""How'd you know I was an American?""""Ah, we know,"" he laughed. ""Yer pretty easy to spot.""""It's great,"" I answered. ""Might be the best place in the world to ride a motorcycle.""""Yep. Been ridin' all my life, too. How I banged up my knee.""""I noticed you were limping.""""Not real fond of our health care system, just now,"" he said. ""I had a knee replacement and wanted to get the top doc in Sydney but he only practices at the private hospitals. Government won't pay the full bill except at public hospitals so the operation cost me some money.""""Some money? A lot?""""Several hundred dollars.""I struggled hard not to laugh. He had gotten his knee replaced by his country's top orthopedic surgeon and had only spent hundreds. My inclination was to tell him about health care costs in the ""land of the free,"" what he might have spent on insurance premiums and deductibles and Medicaid and Medicare taxes, but I enjoyed my time with him talking motorcycles and the summer he and his mates rode up the Gibb River Road deep into the Kimberley. What may be the world's largest and least explored national park, the Kimberley and a motorcycle and I have a date. As I motored through the vineyards of the Baroosa Valley and down to the Limestone Coast, I began to wonder if the overwhelmingly pleasant disposition of the Australians I was meeting had something to do with their social contract. The country's minimum wage is $15.61, which is more than double the U.S. mandated wage rate, and no one is without health care. There is undoubtedly a calculation to be made on the impact this has on homelessness and substance abuse. Income tax rates for wage earners are also reasonable. Incomes ranging from $37,000 to $80,000 are taxed at a base rate of $4,650 plus 30 cents for each dollar over $37,000 for an effective tax rate of 12.6 - 21.9%. $80,000 to $180,000 in earnings is taxed with a base of $17,550 plus 37 cents for each dollar over $80,000 for a rate that ranges from 21.9 - 30.3 percent. Marginal tax rates, of course, can be higher for various reasons but middle class families do not appear to carry an unfair burden, even with the 1.5% tax that pays for the national health care plan called Medicare. Perhaps, much of this has to do with an almost insignificant amount of spending on the military. The $27 billion dollars spent annually on Australia's defense is only 1.8 percent of the gross domestic product. In the U.S., which has considerably larger economy and population, defense spending still appears to consume too much of the nation's treasure. America expends 4.7 percent of its gross domestic product on guns and bombs and planes and elective wars, which is $711 billion dollars every year. China has the number two global military budget at only $143 billion. Books are easier to balance when you aren't buying a lot of guns.Maybe Australia has figured out the recipe for a reasonable hybrid of capitalism and socialism. Their economy is booming now because of natural resource development in the northwest near the ecologically sensitive Kimberley region and mining and drilling and engineering companies are visiting cities like Houston to recruit young workers to forsake America for Oz. One trip along the Great Ocean Road on a motorcycle would create immigrants out of almost every Texas prospect. The Southern Ocean has spent eons eating away at the continental shelf and has left cliffs that rise above the surf by hundreds of feet. There are empty beaches below and in some coves it is possible to look down on sharks slipping between the giant rock formations cut by the sea. Waves of cold water coming all the way from Antarctica are eating away at Australia's southern coast and through the eons have left limestone stacks that have created a formation called the Twelve Apostles. The rock apostles stand in the water and form an eerily beautiful scene. A Few of the ApostlesRenting a hotel room seemed an absurdity when the sky was so close and the air fresh and clean. My preference was to sleep on the ground for the entire 5000-mile journey. One night I awoke to an odd crunching sound and turned my head to see a tall 'roo bent over eating grass a few feet from my head in the Grampian Ranges. As alarmed as I was I still smiled when the moonlight on the animal's face lit up an expression that almost asked, ""What the hell are you doin' here, yank?"" I went back to sleep feeling guilty for having eaten a kangaroo steak earlier that evening.  Morning in the Grampians The recurrent warning for motorcyclists in Australia is not to rise and ride too early or keep rolling close to sundown. The 'roos start moving about and they can ruin a good motorbike. The great motor trains of tractor-trailers crossing the continent at night have gigantic steel bumpers up front to knock the displaced creatures out of the way without even slowing the truck's speed. There did not seem to be many 'roos along the great ocean road and the twisting tarmac that edged out next to the ocean and revealed improbable views around every turn. The plant life was windblown and the rocky soil seemed almost uninhabitable for animals. By nightfall, there was a spot of drinking going on with a group of Aussies and some Czech immigrants on the beach outside Lorne. The ocean had a kind of unsettling loudness and I was barely able to hear the discussion between the Czech woman and her husband, which did not seem to be setting up a restful night of sleep ahead for the couple. The sand was soft, though, and the caravan park and the bridge across the river to a broad and empty beach were lovely and comforting. One of the most dependable characteristics of Australia that travelers encounter is the caravan park. Regardless of a town's size, there is a caravan park, (Americans call them campgrounds), and it's often in the prettiest part of the community. In Albany on the southern coast, I slept next to a river and in Lorne I camped with the ocean sounding through my sleep and in Lakes Entrance the next night on a windy hill beneath eucalyptus trees with 'roos loping past my tent. The Sounding SeaYes, I know, I've made Australia sound like utopia, but, of course, no such place exists on our little blue speck. Oz still struggles to find a way out of how it has treated its indigenous people, the aboriginals. As late as the early 70s, babies were being separated from their parents to be adopted and raised into the white culture. Wrongs are being undone but there seems no policy that is comprehensive enough to please all interests and the aboriginals do not readily choose the bush over the city, which suggests a sustaining wisdom for their culture. The U.S., of course, also has a bleak history of near genocide of Native Americans and our move toward civil rights has been a painful struggle that has not yet ended. These issues still confound both countries as Oz tries to manage Asian immigration and America talks about militarizing its frontier with Mexico to keep out undocumented border crossers. Observing from a distance, as with a lost love, I have been heartened that Australia's political discourse has not yet been riven with the destructive vitriol spewed by the two parties proselytizing on American cable television. The Aussies undoubtedly think their politics are infected and destructive but they have mostly not spent time in the U.S. watching our democracy's absurdities unfold at election time.None of this was of any consideration as the motorbike was pointed toward a dirt track that ran up the Great Dividing Range between the Snowy Mountains and the Victorian Alps. The dirt route was narrow and the passage of two vehicles appeared impossible but two wheels were, as always, freedom. In more than 100 plus miles, only one other vehicle passed in the other direction and it was a forest service Ute. Along the edge of this track there were no guardrails and a missed turn, as altitude was acquired, meant a tumble of a few thousand meters. Uninhabited canyons split the mountain ranges and shimmering rivers reached out toward coastal horizons. There was no sign of humanity other than the dirt track that had been bladed and blasted into the mountainsides. The BMW purred and leaned and took to the roll as if it were enjoying the ride as much as I was, and the sun flickered through the trees as I realized I had finally taken a trip that I wished might never end.But I am an outsider, a Yank, and went home to Texas. In retrospect now, I see Australia as a younger America. Great cities with global businesses, small startups with unknown potential, interesting food and art and architecture, (great writers like Tim Winton), and all the land and natural resources it might need to support its modest population. And yes, Australians might be able to make their country even greater. There are problems to be confronted. But it will be a mighty struggle for improvement. And I would suggest they not try too hard. Grab another VB and take a second look at the sunset. Things are pretty damned good down under.  Special thanks to I. F.

Oddly, near the front door, propped up on an easel, there sat a large plastic poster with graphic depictions of ""The Spiders of Australia."" I had a beer and then went back to check again that I had zipped up my tent.Coming down off the Nullarboor, the proprietor of a petrol station introduced a baby kangaroo, a ""Joey"" that he had rescued while out cruising around in the bush with his four-wheeler. They are even stranger creatures when they are tiny. A hot wind followed the BMW down the Ayre Peninsula but there were oysters at Coffin Bay and by nightfall the next day bottles of local vintage wines were popped in the Clare Valley.  Little Lost JoeyWalking across the campground, I was greeted by a slender, gray-haired man with a bit of a limp. ""How's yer ride goin', yank?""""How'd you know I was an American?""""Ah, we know,"" he laughed. ""Yer pretty easy to spot.""""It's great,"" I answered. ""Might be the best place in the world to ride a motorcycle.""""Yep. Been ridin' all my life, too. How I banged up my knee.""""I noticed you were limping.""""Not real fond of our health care system, just now,"" he said. ""I had a knee replacement and wanted to get the top doc in Sydney but he only practices at the private hospitals. Government won't pay the full bill except at public hospitals so the operation cost me some money.""""Some money? A lot?""""Several hundred dollars.""I struggled hard not to laugh. He had gotten his knee replaced by his country's top orthopedic surgeon and had only spent hundreds. My inclination was to tell him about health care costs in the ""land of the free,"" what he might have spent on insurance premiums and deductibles and Medicaid and Medicare taxes, but I enjoyed my time with him talking motorcycles and the summer he and his mates rode up the Gibb River Road deep into the Kimberley. What may be the world's largest and least explored national park, the Kimberley and a motorcycle and I have a date. As I motored through the vineyards of the Baroosa Valley and down to the Limestone Coast, I began to wonder if the overwhelmingly pleasant disposition of the Australians I was meeting had something to do with their social contract. The country's minimum wage is $15.61, which is more than double the U.S. mandated wage rate, and no one is without health care. There is undoubtedly a calculation to be made on the impact this has on homelessness and substance abuse. Income tax rates for wage earners are also reasonable. Incomes ranging from $37,000 to $80,000 are taxed at a base rate of $4,650 plus 30 cents for each dollar over $37,000 for an effective tax rate of 12.6 - 21.9%. $80,000 to $180,000 in earnings is taxed with a base of $17,550 plus 37 cents for each dollar over $80,000 for a rate that ranges from 21.9 - 30.3 percent. Marginal tax rates, of course, can be higher for various reasons but middle class families do not appear to carry an unfair burden, even with the 1.5% tax that pays for the national health care plan called Medicare. Perhaps, much of this has to do with an almost insignificant amount of spending on the military. The $27 billion dollars spent annually on Australia's defense is only 1.8 percent of the gross domestic product. In the U.S., which has considerably larger economy and population, defense spending still appears to consume too much of the nation's treasure. America expends 4.7 percent of its gross domestic product on guns and bombs and planes and elective wars, which is $711 billion dollars every year. China has the number two global military budget at only $143 billion. Books are easier to balance when you aren't buying a lot of guns.Maybe Australia has figured out the recipe for a reasonable hybrid of capitalism and socialism. Their economy is booming now because of natural resource development in the northwest near the ecologically sensitive Kimberley region and mining and drilling and engineering companies are visiting cities like Houston to recruit young workers to forsake America for Oz. One trip along the Great Ocean Road on a motorcycle would create immigrants out of almost every Texas prospect. The Southern Ocean has spent eons eating away at the continental shelf and has left cliffs that rise above the surf by hundreds of feet. There are empty beaches below and in some coves it is possible to look down on sharks slipping between the giant rock formations cut by the sea. Waves of cold water coming all the way from Antarctica are eating away at Australia's southern coast and through the eons have left limestone stacks that have created a formation called the Twelve Apostles. The rock apostles stand in the water and form an eerily beautiful scene. A Few of the ApostlesRenting a hotel room seemed an absurdity when the sky was so close and the air fresh and clean. My preference was to sleep on the ground for the entire 5000-mile journey. One night I awoke to an odd crunching sound and turned my head to see a tall 'roo bent over eating grass a few feet from my head in the Grampian Ranges. As alarmed as I was I still smiled when the moonlight on the animal's face lit up an expression that almost asked, ""What the hell are you doin' here, yank?"" I went back to sleep feeling guilty for having eaten a kangaroo steak earlier that evening.  Morning in the Grampians The recurrent warning for motorcyclists in Australia is not to rise and ride too early or keep rolling close to sundown. The 'roos start moving about and they can ruin a good motorbike. The great motor trains of tractor-trailers crossing the continent at night have gigantic steel bumpers up front to knock the displaced creatures out of the way without even slowing the truck's speed. There did not seem to be many 'roos along the great ocean road and the twisting tarmac that edged out next to the ocean and revealed improbable views around every turn. The plant life was windblown and the rocky soil seemed almost uninhabitable for animals. By nightfall, there was a spot of drinking going on with a group of Aussies and some Czech immigrants on the beach outside Lorne. The ocean had a kind of unsettling loudness and I was barely able to hear the discussion between the Czech woman and her husband, which did not seem to be setting up a restful night of sleep ahead for the couple. The sand was soft, though, and the caravan park and the bridge across the river to a broad and empty beach were lovely and comforting. One of the most dependable characteristics of Australia that travelers encounter is the caravan park. Regardless of a town's size, there is a caravan park, (Americans call them campgrounds), and it's often in the prettiest part of the community. In Albany on the southern coast, I slept next to a river and in Lorne I camped with the ocean sounding through my sleep and in Lakes Entrance the next night on a windy hill beneath eucalyptus trees with 'roos loping past my tent. The Sounding SeaYes, I know, I've made Australia sound like utopia, but, of course, no such place exists on our little blue speck. Oz still struggles to find a way out of how it has treated its indigenous people, the aboriginals. As late as the early 70s, babies were being separated from their parents to be adopted and raised into the white culture. Wrongs are being undone but there seems no policy that is comprehensive enough to please all interests and the aboriginals do not readily choose the bush over the city, which suggests a sustaining wisdom for their culture. The U.S., of course, also has a bleak history of near genocide of Native Americans and our move toward civil rights has been a painful struggle that has not yet ended. These issues still confound both countries as Oz tries to manage Asian immigration and America talks about militarizing its frontier with Mexico to keep out undocumented border crossers. Observing from a distance, as with a lost love, I have been heartened that Australia's political discourse has not yet been riven with the destructive vitriol spewed by the two parties proselytizing on American cable television. The Aussies undoubtedly think their politics are infected and destructive but they have mostly not spent time in the U.S. watching our democracy's absurdities unfold at election time.None of this was of any consideration as the motorbike was pointed toward a dirt track that ran up the Great Dividing Range between the Snowy Mountains and the Victorian Alps. The dirt route was narrow and the passage of two vehicles appeared impossible but two wheels were, as always, freedom. In more than 100 plus miles, only one other vehicle passed in the other direction and it was a forest service Ute. Along the edge of this track there were no guardrails and a missed turn, as altitude was acquired, meant a tumble of a few thousand meters. Uninhabited canyons split the mountain ranges and shimmering rivers reached out toward coastal horizons. There was no sign of humanity other than the dirt track that had been bladed and blasted into the mountainsides. The BMW purred and leaned and took to the roll as if it were enjoying the ride as much as I was, and the sun flickered through the trees as I realized I had finally taken a trip that I wished might never end.But I am an outsider, a Yank, and went home to Texas. In retrospect now, I see Australia as a younger America. Great cities with global businesses, small startups with unknown potential, interesting food and art and architecture, (great writers like Tim Winton), and all the land and natural resources it might need to support its modest population. And yes, Australians might be able to make their country even greater. There are problems to be confronted. But it will be a mighty struggle for improvement. And I would suggest they not try too hard. Grab another VB and take a second look at the sunset. Things are pretty damned good down under.  Special thanks to I. F.

(The New Yorker summed it up pretty neatly, deftly pointing out the ridiculous of the small and large ends of the spectrum.) While the numbers were spinning wildly out of control, most of us were still confused about what SPF we should be wearing. Higher is better, right? According to the American Academy of Dermatology, a very legit source on the subject, the required level is SPF30. So does that make these crazy-high sunscreens around 3x more effective? Not necessarily. Luckily, those exorbitant SPF levels are not long for this world; regulators are cracking down. Here to explain what level SPF we should actually be wearing is New York dermatologist Anne Chapas. Keep scrolling for seven sunblocks to keep you protected this summer. For regular, everyday use, what level sunscreen should we be wearing? ""The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that everyone apply a sunscreen with an SPF30 every day, and an SPF50 before participating in outdoor activities.""SPF30 seems low compared to all the other SPF levels on the market. Why is this number so low? ""The number means that it would take 30 times longer to burn than not wearing any sunscreen. That means if it would take a minute to burn without sunscreen, it would take 30 minutes to burn after applying the recommended amount of SPF30. This is usually adequate for low levels of sun exposure.""There are so many sunscreens that are topping SPF100. Does a super-high SPF become ineffective at a certain number?  ""The FDA has recently recommended changing the sunscreen labeling to avoid this confusion. Soon the highest level available will be 50+.""Should different skin tones wear different levels of SPF?  ""Everyone should wear sunscreen since the sun causes skin cancer and aging in all skin types. The Academy does not recommend different levels depending on skin tone.""Want more?

There was no screaming, and the only tears were from the blisters on my feet: I spent the weekend hiking in upstate New York, completely oblivious to the fact that I wasn't still a teenager.

After waking up in the morning and sipping my coffee from the private deck of my room in the woods, I got my day pass to Mohonk Preserve and started off on a journey I will never forget. Inside the Preserve, there's a particular trail called the Labyrinth, which is essentially nature's jungle gym. It's a steep climb up, over and through caves, boulders, several ladders and rickety bridges, all while on the side of a mountain where one wrong step and I wasn't going to live to see 32. I stopped at one point and stared up at the crevice, a claustrophobia-inducing straight climb up through a teeny tiny opening in the mountain. I eventually reached a 75-foot ladder, which was not much wider than a foot and mostly leaning sideways, rendering it fairly useless. After squeezing through the top, I discovered why it was all worth it: Standing out on a 1,500-foot ridge, I was treated to views that were completely breathtaking. I continued on to Sky Top, aka Smiley Tower, where I climbed the 101 steps to the top. From the top of the tower, there's a view of six states. While I certainly was feeling the strain on my muscles by the end of the trip (26.5 miles in three days!), there really are no words to describe how incredible the experience was.

From bistro-style tables and chairs to more traditional wood pieces, the best dining sets will fit into your outdoor space without making it feel overcrowded. Additionally, they should also be able to withstand the elements during the changing seasons.Most importantly, your outdoor dining set should complement your style and preference. If you're considering an outdoor dining set right now, here are some general things you should keep an eye out for. Consider the best materials. Sturdy woods and metals like teak and powder-coated aluminum are popular choices for outdoor dining furniture. Teak stands up to the elements extremely well and it's more durable than most other varieties. After exposure to sunlight and rain, teak also develops a nice shiny patina, aging well over time. Consider versatility. Aluminum on the other hand is best suited for seasonal use because it's lightweight, but still sturdy and powder-coated versions can often come in an array of colors, making it versatile for many different outdoor environments. Similarly, rattan and wicker pieces are also easy to move, and outdoor chairs made from these materials can often provide the most comfort because of their tight cushy weaves.Decide on size. The size of your dining set will depend on your outdoor space. Generally, bistro-style sets (two chairs and one table) are ideal for small patios and decks, so if you're looking to create a small corner for relaxing, they can be a great option. Although, if you're considering taking meals outdoors, go with a full dining set, which can range from four seats to eight depending on how much space you have in your garden/backyard.Think about the surface. Wood table tops require the least amount of maintenance since they can be easily wiped clean with a bit of mild soap. Metal tables, if left out in direct sun for extended periods can heat up quickly, so it's best to keep them in a shaded area or under a patio umbrella. Similarly, glass table tops are simple to clean and make pretty accents in a garden, but their fragile nature means they're best used in covered porches, patios or decks. Moreover, they're weak against the elements so they should definitely be moved indoors during colder seasons.Flip through the slideshow below to see some of our favorite outdoor dining sets in the marketplace right now. And, let us know in comments below what else you look for in an outdoor dining set. Have something to say? Be sure to check out Stylelist Home on Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest."

The white stitch detail on the black jacket with the gray double-breasted vest gave it the fashionable twist I was looking for! For ""Imagine,"" Joshua began with a white blazer with a crystallized collar, but I decided to save that for the finale. Nigel Lythgoe (AI's executive producer) asked for a more demure style. So, I put a tuxedo jacket on Joshua, and, I have to say, it was a nice clean change. For Joshua's last look, I wanted to keep him cool and fabulous. How could I keep him in blazers and suits all night?! I crystallized his shoulders with Swarovski crystals and made sure that, even with the dark slick colors, he popped on that stage!(LEFT, 1st look for ""I'd Rather Go Blind"" by Etta James) Joshua ""brought down the house"" for Randy's song choice in an Express shirt, D.Gnak by Kang.D vest, Moschino jacket, Zara pants, and Aldo shoes.

Last girl standing, I wanted her to be a dream! The designer of her first gown, Oliver Tolentino, sent me an email telling me how Jessica's grandfather lives across the street from him in the Philippines; how could I not go and visit his showroom in LA? Thank goodness he had that dress that stood out to me amongst all his beautiful pieces... It was nice to know Jessica was wearing a piece from part of her heritage. Her jumpsuit for Steven's song choice was absolutely perfect, with the huge pants and fitted top. I wanted the outfit to be muted and her voice, face, and statement jewelry pieces to take the limelight. For the Jackson 5 outfit, I had to style her up street chic and, of course, the coral red jacket was perfect! Can I just say...

Scroll down for the complete #fashion credits.(Have style questions? Have you seen something you #loved? Find me on Twitter: @SoysFashion.)JOSHUA LEDETFor Etta James I wanted Joshua to look super classy. A three-piece suit was in order, but I wanted to give it a little twist. The white stitch detail on the black jacket with the gray double-breasted vest gave it the fashionable twist I was looking for! For ""Imagine,"" Joshua began with a white blazer with a crystallized collar, but I decided to save that for the finale. Nigel Lythgoe (AI's executive producer) asked for a more demure style. So, I put a tuxedo jacket on Joshua, and, I have to say, it was a nice clean change. For Joshua's last look, I wanted to keep him cool and fabulous. How could I keep him in blazers and suits all night?! I crystallized his shoulders with Swarovski crystals and made sure that, even with the dark slick colors, he popped on that stage!(LEFT, 1st look for ""I'd Rather Go Blind"" by Etta James) Joshua ""brought down the house"" for Randy's song choice in an Express shirt, D.Gnak by Kang.D vest, Moschino jacket, Zara pants, and Aldo shoes. He wore a Christian Tse watch. (CENTER, 2nd look for ""Imagine"" by John Lennon) For his personal song choice, Joshua wore a Paul Smith top and Zara pants and jacket. He wore Aldo shoes and a Christian Tse watch. (RIGHT, 3rd look for ""No More Drama"" by Mary J. Blige) I styled Joshua in an American Apparel shirt topped with a G-Star jacket with Kizmit customizations, J Brand pants, and Hudson shoes. Accessories included a Nashelle necklace, Rodeo belt, and Oceanaut watch.PHILLIP PHILLIPSWhy is Phillip wearing the best of the best? Because of the fit and the quality of each garment! This night I wanted to give a recap of all the different looks Phillip has worn so far with a button-down shirt, t-shirt, and blazer. I love working with artists that know what they like because you can really explore other options within the same vein of style. Finding the perfect jacket, pants, shoes, and shirts is always a #FUN challenge with Phillip.(LEFT, 1st look for Steven's pick of ""Beggin'"" by Madcon) Phillip wore a top by AG Jeans paired with a Hartford button-up shirt, 7 For All Mankind jeans, a J. Crew belt, and shoes by The Frye Company. (CENTER, 2nd look for ""Disease"" by Matchbox Twenty) Phillip wore a Gap tee, John Varvatos button-up shirt, 7 For All Mankind pants, and a J. Crew belt. Accessories included shoes by The Frye Company and bracelets of his own. (RIGHT, 3rd look for ""We've Got Tonight"" by John Seger) I styled Phillip in a Supima shirt, Theory jacket, Dylan George pants, and shoes by The Frye Company.JESSICA SANCHEZThis was the night I wanted Jessica in a gorgeous gown. Last girl standing, I wanted her to be a dream! The designer of her first gown, Oliver Tolentino, sent me an email telling me how Jessica's grandfather lives across the street from him in the Philippines; how could I not go and visit his showroom in LA? Thank goodness he had that dress that stood out to me amongst all his beautiful pieces... It was nice to know Jessica was wearing a piece from part of her heritage. Her jumpsuit for Steven's song choice was absolutely perfect, with the huge pants and fitted top. I wanted the outfit to be muted and her voice, face, and statement jewelry pieces to take the limelight. For the Jackson 5 outfit, I had to style her up street chic and, of course, the coral red jacket was perfect! Can I just say... I #LOVED her Jeffrey Campbell boots!(LEFT, 1st look for ""My All"" by Mariah Carey (chosen by JLo)) Jessica wore an Oliver Tolentino dress and Bebe shoes. Jewelry included earrings, a bracelet, and rings by Erica Courtney. (CENTER, 2nd look ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"" by Aerosmith) For her song selection, this fashionista wore a skin tone-matching Zimmermann jumpsuit (here's the one she wore before), a Zara belt, and Bebe shoes. Jewelry included this Bijou Tresor necklace and Erica Courtney earrings, rings, and bracelet. (RIGHT, 3rd look for ""I'll Be There"" by the Jackson 5) Jessica wore a Silence & Noise shirt topped with a Cut25 jacket, jeans by Robin's Jean, Express belt and necklace, and Jeffrey Campbell shoes. Other jewelry included Erica Courtney earrings and rings."
