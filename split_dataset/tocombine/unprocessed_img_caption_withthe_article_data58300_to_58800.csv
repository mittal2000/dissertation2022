The song takes us back to the peak era of of alt- and pop-rock of the late '90s and early aughts, with Mark Hoppus' vocals taking center stage, complemented by Travis Barker's signature quick drumming. Guitarist and singer Matt Skiba, of the Alkaline Trio, has stepped in to fill Tom DeLonge's shoes. DeLonge went through a ""friendly divorce"" with the band and left for good in 2015.

Calvelli, executive vice president of public affairs for the Wildlife Conservation Society, wrote in a blog for The Huffington Post. ""It already appears on two state flags, on the seal of the U.S. Department of the Interior and National Park Service, and on our currency."" (Check out the state quarters for Kansas, North Dakota and Montana.)It is also considered the first American conservation success story.In the 1500s, an estimated 30 to 60 million bison, also known as buffalo, roamed North America. They played a vital role in Native American culture, providing many tribes with material for food, shelter and tools.But as Americans pushed westward during the 19th century, the species was driven to the brink of extinction. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Americans had so decimated the population that by 1884, there were just 325 wild bison living in the U.S.Now, after many years of legal protection, the population is healthy once again, estimated at more than 500,000 individual bison living in both commercial and conservation herds. According to a WCS Press Release, the current bill will ""officially commemorate the ecological, cultural, historical and economic contribution of bison"" and is the result of four years of effort by the Vote Bison Coalition -- a group of more than 60 organizations, tribes and businesses.While the House of Representatives passed the National Bison Legacy Act late Tuesday night, the Senate passed its version of the bill last December and is now expected to adopt the House version, according to WCS. Once signed by the president, the law would catapult the bison into a family of classic American symbols, including the oak (the national tree), the rose (the national floral emblem) and the bald eagle (the national emblem).UPDATE: The Senate gave final approval to the bill on Thursday, and it's now headed for the president's desk."
3,HEALTHY LIVING,These Lifestyle Factors Are Linked To Sperm Damage,"Kathryn Doyle, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/these-lifestyle-factors-are-linked-to-sperm-damage_us_572224cde4b01a5ebde4a91c,"Obesity, stress and cell phone use were linked to DNA fragmentation in sperm.",2016-04-28,Sperm DNA damage can affect male fertility as well as the genes they pass on to their kids. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572225922200002900254ccf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kathryn Doyle(Reuters Health) – - Certain lifestyle factors are linked to higher rates of damage in the genetic material in men’s sperm, a study suggests. The damage - which may stem from factors like obesity, stress and even cell phone use - could affect men's ability to conceive as well as the genes passed to their children, researchers say.Semen analysis usually looks at the numbers and the condition of whole sperm. But the authors of a small study in Poland believe the degree of breakage, or fragmentation, in DNA strands in the sperm might be a better indicator of fertility. DNA carries the cell's genetic information and hereditary characteristics.Men with fragmentation have lower odds of conceiving naturally and through procedures like in vitro fertilization, they write in the International Journal of Impotence Research.Researchers have noticed before that lifestyle factors can influence the level of sperm DNA fragmentation, said Ricardo P. Bertolla of Sao Paulo Federal University in Brazil, who was not part of the new study.“More importantly, we do expect that environmental and lifestyle factors may influence male fertility, but the degree of response is highly variable among individuals,” Bertolla told Reuters Health by email.Dr. Marian Radwan of Gameta Hospital in Rzgow, Poland, focused their study on 286 men under age 45 who were attending an infertility clinic.Radwan did not respond to a request for comment.Most of the men were overweight, nonsmokers, and with moderate levels of work stress and life stress. Half had been using a cell phone for 6 to 10 years.The men all had normal semen concentrations, but older men and those with higher work stress had more fragmentation of the DNA in their sperm.Men who were obese or had used a cell phone for more than 10 years also tended to have a higher percentage of immature sperm than others.Coffee or alcohol use, smoking and physical activity levels were not linked to DNA fragmentation, the researchers report.There is some evidence that DNA damage, beyond affecting a man's fertility, may be passed along to offspring, raising their risk of gene mutations linked to various illnesses, the study team notes.Even men with otherwise normal sperm parameters, like ejaculate volume and sperm concentration, may have increased levels of free radicals and DNA damage in their sperm, said Rima Dada of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, who was not part of the new study.Up to 40 percent of reproductive-age men have some issue with sperm production, Dada told Reuters Health by email.But they wouldn't know it, because standard semen analysis does not involve testing for DNA damage in sperm, she added.“The important thing is that majority of factors which cause oxidative stress which result in DNA damage are due to our poor social habits and unhealthy lifestyle, and simple lifestyle interventions and quitting smoking and doing yoga and meditation can reduce both psychological stress and oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage,” she said.Bertolla, however, is “currently not convinced” that cell phone use damages sperm. “I do not see any definitive proof that this is true,” he said.The new study does not prove that any lifestyle factors cause DNA damage in sperm, only that they are associated with each other, he noted.“There are some companies that produce antioxidants specifically designed to improve male fertility, but it is my opinion that antioxidants are useful only for those men that need it,” he said. “I know this sounds very simple and obvious, but there are many men that end up taking antioxidants without a real need for them (or who will not benefit from them), and this ends up giving a general notion that antioxidant supplementation will not work.”SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1pF9pxA The International Journal of Impotence Research, online April 14, 2016."

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) says gambling on a completely unpredictable Supreme Court nominee from a President Donald Trump is better than voting on President Barack Obama's moderate pick.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57223e3a2200002900254d59.jpeg?ops=crop_5_0_2563_1478%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) conceded Thursday that there's a flaw in the GOP's plan to block President Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court: Who the hell would a President Donald Trump pick for the seat?The argument Republicans make for denying a vote to Obama's pick, Merrick Garland, is that Obama is in his last year of office, so the next president should get to make the lifetime appointment. Not only is that an unprecedented move -- Obama is still the president and he's supposed to get up-or-down votes on his nominees -- but it's one that could leave Republicans worse off if their party's presidential front-runner wins.For all his success in the polls, Trump has given few details on any of his policies or the kinds of judges he'd put on courts. All he's said about the Supreme Court is that he'd defer to the conservative Heritage Foundation to give him names.""If Trump's elected president, it probably is a little more unknown than if there's a [Sen. Ted] Cruz elected president,"" Grassley said Wednesday in an interview with Robert Leonard of KNIA/KRLS radio in Iowa.""I would have to admit it's a gamble.""Here's a clip from the segment:It's not just the unknowns of Trump that create problems for Republicans. If former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, there's a fair chance she'd pick someone more progressive than Garland, who's considered relatively moderate. There's also a chance the Senate GOP will lose its majority in November, which could leave Republicans in the doomsday scenario of Clinton nominating a liberal Supreme Court pick and a Democrat-led Senate confirming Clinton's selection.Some moderate Republican senators like Mark Kirk (Ill.) and Susan Collins (Maine) have broken from party leaders and called for Garland to get a vote. Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.), who is running for Senate, and former Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) said this week that they think Garland deserves a vote, too.Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, is standing by his decision not to hold confirmation hearings this year.""I haven't second-guessed myself,"" he said. ""It's a gamble on who's going to be the next president of the United States. I second-guess that. But I guess that's a point that I'm willing to take."""

Nikki Haley (R) has vowed to prevent the Obama administration from sending Guantanamo detainees to her state as part of an effort to close the offshore prison.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) arrived on Capitol Hill for a House hearing Thursday morning with a long list of reasons why she will never allow Guantanamo Bay detainees to be transferred to the Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston, South Carolina.It’s “the city we call the holy city,” “the number one vacation spot in the country,” “the friendliest state in the union,” “the most patriotic state in the Union,” Haley told members of the House Oversight and Management Efficiency Subcommittee. “Why would anyone want to put terrorists in Charleston?” The South Carolina governor then switched to a more somber note. “We looked hate in the eye last year,” she said, referring to the shooting by a white gunman, who killed nine people at a historic black church in Charleston. “Our state is still recovering from that.” Homeland Security Committee ranking member Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), a black lawmaker who has been outspoken about calling the Charleston shooting an act of domestic terrorism -- a term Haley has also used to describe the attack -- jumped at the chance to point out a contradiction in her logic. “Can you, just for the record, tell me who has custody of the young man charged with killing the people at Mother Emanuel?” Thompson asked, referring to the church where the shooting occurred. “He’s in South Carolina,” Haley responded.“Do you know where? Is he in Charleston? Is he in Sumter?” probed Thompson. “He’s in Charleston,” Haley said. Thompson asked if that arrangement posed any security issues to the people of Charleston. Haley said it had not but implied that Thompson’s comparison missed the point. “It’s a constant reminder of what happened ... no one wants him there,” she said. “We just don’t want 80 more coming to Charleston. Dealing with one has shaken the state enough.”In February, President Barack Obama announced the vague outlines of a long-anticipated plan to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. His plan involves sending as many of the 80 prisoners as possible to other countries, and transferring the remaining group of people, who will either be charged with a crime, or are considered too dangerous to release, to an undisclosed facility in the U.S. Of the 80 prisoners still at Guantanamo, 26 are approved for transfer, meaning the number of detainees that could be sent stateside will likely be closer to 54 individuals.Congressional restrictions currently outlaw the transfer of any Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. and the Obama administration has not specified where it envisions sending the prisoners. But the Pentagon has reviewed military facilities and federal prisons in South Carolina, Kansas and Colorado as potential sites. The governors of all three states, including Democratic governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper, are adamantly opposed to transferring Guantanamo prisoners to sites within their states. Haley said on Thursday that the Obama administration “could pay the state of South Carolina to host these terrorists and we wouldn’t take them for any amount of money.” Throughout the hearing, Haley argued that the presence of Guantanamo detainees at the consolidated Naval Brig in Charleston would scare away business owners interested in investing in her state and terrify parents who send their children to schools in the area. In the years following the Sept. 11 attacks, her state housed former Guantanamo detainee Yaser Hamdi and Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen later convicted of plotting a terror attack with al Qaeda. Haley rejected the comparison to past precedents and said the current situation is different because of the timing and the number of potential prisoners.But toward the end of the questioning from lawmakers, Haley offered another reason to keep Guantanamo prisons in the offshore prison in Cuba -- and it's a reason that most public officials prefer to leave unsaid.“Why do we want to put them on American soil?” Haley asked. “What sort of rights are they now going to have? We’ve watched the Supreme Court totally start to go down that slippery slope. We’ve dealt with the habeas corpus issues. We’ve dealt with all that. So now, what rights are we going to say that they’re going to have because they are now are on U.S. soil?""

""These ideals guided our decisions.

The two new residential colleges are slated to open in 2017.The decision to retain the name Calhoun College, which has been called that since 1933, caps a period of petitions, protests and widespread student outcry. Nearly 1,500 current and former students had asked Salovey to remove the name entirely, saying such an honor for Calhoun showed ""disrespect for black perspectives,"" particularly after the rise of racial tensions on college campus across the country.But Salovey said renaming Calhoun College would be a refusal to ""face [our] own history of slavery and racism.""""Yale is part of that history,” Salovey said in a statement. “We cannot erase American history but we can confront it, teach it, and learn from it.

The term ""head of college"" will replace it.The New York Times notes some had linked the term to slavery, including the head of Yale's Pierson College. Yale said the title actually stemmed from a legacy that began at universities in England and can still be found on the eponymously named master's degrees.

Many people think that's already how things work, but it isn't.The way things work right now is that brokers who oversee retirement savings accounts can be paid extra to steer their clients into unnecessarily expensive funds or excessively risky investments, without disclosing that fact to their clients. That sort of conflicted investment advice costs Americans saving for retirement $17 billion a year, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers.To remedy the situation, the Obama administration proposed a fiduciary rule to keep Wall Street from taking so much money in fees from retirement accounts. The financial industry has opposed the rule from the start, saying it will raise costs and limit the advice investors can receive.Legislators have tried to undercut the proposed rule, which is currently being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, for some time. In December, there was a push, which ultimately failed, to include language neutering the rule in the massive omnibus spending bill. And in October 2015, the House passed a similar bill to the one passed Thursday. Three such measures have been introduced in the Senate.Fortunately for those worried about how this could affect savings, it's likely that Obama would veto any bill rejecting the fiduciary rule that made it through the House and Senate."

Marco Rubio is pushing his GOP colleagues to take action on emergency funding to combat the Zika virus.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Republican leaders in Congress may be taking a slow, deliberate approach to dealing with the looming threat of the Zika virus, but Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) warned his colleagues Thursday that it’s about time for them to freak out about the mosquito-borne disease.The administration of President Barack Obama asked for $1.9 billion in emergency funding to combat the virus in February, but Republicans in Congress have balked, saying they have questions that have not been answered about how the White House will use the money.In the meantime, health officials have warned that Zika, which is linked to birth defects, is even more dangerous than previously thought, and that dozens of states are at risk from the mosquitoes that transmit the virus.Rubio took to the Senate floor Thursday and tried to convey the threat to his fellow Republicans, saying he is especially concerned after getting briefed by officials in his state.""They are freaked out about the Zika thing. I don't know any other term to use. If they are freaked out, then I'm very concerned about it as well,"" Rubio said. ""And that's why I do support fully and immediately funding the situation."" Rubio spoke after a string of Democrats who had insisted that Congress act before it goes on a 10-day break Friday.The Floridian wasn't willing to go that far, but he suggested that during the recess lawmakers should be drawing up the legislation needed to act as soon as they return.""I hope that there is real urgency about dealing with this,"" Rubio said. ""I understand this is not a political issue. There is no such thing as a Republican position on Zika or Democrat position on Zika because these mosquitoes bite everyone. And they're not going to ask you what your party registration is or who you plan to vote for in November.""He also warned that cases of infection are inevitable in the continental United States, and that Congress should act sooner rather than later, for both practical and political reasons.""This is a real threat, and it is not just the tropical states,"" Rubio said. ""We are going to face the Zika problem in this country this summer and fall.""""My advice to my colleagues is we're going to deal with this, and I hope we deal with it at the front end, because not only is it better for our people, it's better for you,"" he added. ""You're going to have to explain to people why it is that we sat around for weeks and did nothing on something of this magnitude.""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not seem overly inclined to jump at Rubio's request.Earlier, he pointed out that the White House has funding already because it transferred almost $600 million from the effort to prevent Ebola outbreaks. ""Preventing the spread of Zika is something that both parties agree is a priority,"" McConnell said, adding that both sides have been working diligently on the funding.""That's especially notable when you consider how difficult it is for the [Appropriations] Committee to move forward when the administration keeps it waiting for month after month after month for information it needs, as has been the case here with Zika. Progress is being made, anyway.""Still, Rubio argued that this was no time to wait on the normal appropriations process.""It's just a matter of days, weeks, or hours before you will open up a newspaper, turn on the news and it will say someone in the continental United States was bit by a mosquito and they contracted Zika,"" Rubio said. ""And when that happens, then everyone is going to be freaked out, not just me.""""I want to know what people are going to say when this happens and [people] ask what did you do about it?"" Rubio added."

Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), flanked by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), left, and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) at a meeting on Capitol Hill. The three helped author a criminal justice reform bill that now has bipartisan support.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Efforts to reform the country’s strict sentencing laws aren’t dead in Congress just yet. A bipartisan group of senior senators revealed revisions Thursday to legislation that would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders and give judges greater discretion on sentencing for low-level drug crimes. The changes prevent violent criminals from qualifying for reduced sentencing options. However, they also expand provisions for low-level offenders, meaning more of them will benefit from the legislation and the total number of people affected will remain roughly the same as under the original bill.The revisions also ensure that inmates convicted under the Armed Career Criminal Act will not be able to qualify for reduced sentences, while boosting mandatory sentences for offenses involving the opioid fentanyl, which is tied to drug overdoses and deaths. As the authors intended, the tweaks convinced more Republicans to back the controversial bill. Without strong support within the GOP conference, Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) won’t be able to get the legislation to the floor for a vote. As of Thursday, four additional Republican senators joined -- Sens. Mark Kirk (Ill.), Steve Daines (Mont.), Thad Cochran (Miss.), and Dan Sullivan (Alaska) -- giving the bill 37 co-sponsors.The task now is to continue wooing more members of the GOP conference and convince Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that if he brings the package to the floor, it will have enough support to pass with 60 votes. “I think it’s time for those discussions to start right now,” Grassley said of approaching McConnell with the new text and cosponsors. “Mitch McConnell has been waiting for a signal from the Republican side that they’re ready for the bill; I think today we have a signal,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who helped author the bill. “We’re going to plead with him to put us on the agenda and try to move this as quickly as we can.” Durbin stressed that the bill can pass the upper chamber with a majority of Democrats and Republicans backing it. “This is the best chance in a generation to reform our federal drug sentencing laws,” he said. Still, the bill's fragility was lost on no one. To keep the package together, Senate Judiciary Committee leadership continued “breathing life into it again though various tribulations,” committee member Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said. And alterations to the bill are unlikely to win over its harshest Republican critics -- namely, Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Jeff Sessions (Ala.) and Cornyn’s fellow Texan, GOP hopeful Ted Cruz, who all argue that a reduction in mandatory minimums would make communities less safe. Cotton immediately attacked the changes, saying the “revised bill only raises more serious questions.” Sessions questioned whether the bill would “send a message to judges and prosecutors that we’re not interested in people serving sentences anymore"" as “the crime rate is beginning to go up.” The U.S. crime rate is at a historic low, according to a recent study by the Brennan Center for Justice, and remained steady from 2014 to 2015.Then there’s the issue of whether the bill will contain a provision on ""mens rea,"" or having a ""guilty mind."" The provision, if included, would require prosecutors to prove a defendant’s guilt by establishing that he or she consciously intended to commit the offense.Under federal regulations and statues, this isn't required for certain offenses, such as crimes committed by corporate executives against public health or welfare. Republicans in the House badly want the ""mens rea"" requirement to apply to these crimes, but Democrats don’t -- making it evident that there are still deep divisions to overcome despite Thursday's bipartisan announcement.“It’s pretty clear to me that it’s going to be in the House bill, so at some point we are going to need to deal with it,” Cornyn said of the contested mens rea provision. “We’ve seen the over-criminalization of our regulatory system.” “One of the reasons it’s not in this bill is because senators like myself take exactly the opposing view,” said Whitehouse. “If we want to get into re-litigating elements of federal criminal code, then we can have that discussion separately.”“Like I said, no consensus,” Cornyn said. Overall, the bill’s proponents are optimistic, pointing to recent endorsements by key groups like the National District Attorneys Association -- the largest group of prosecutors in the country.The presidential race doesn't hurt either, according to Inimai Chettiar, director of the justice program for the Brennan Center for Justice. The need for criminal justice reform has become an important topic on the campaign trail, Chettiar said, and it's ""putting more pressure on the federal government to do something.""Groups like U.S. Justice Action Network intend to keep applying that pressure, especially on senators who are up for re-election in hotly contested races this year, said Holly Harris, executive director of the advocacy organization. Cornyn wouldn't say whether growing support for the bill means a vote could come up soon after the Senate recess next week. But if floor time opens up due to a stall in appropriations bills, he and other lawmakers are going to be ready to get the sentencing bill in there. ""We’ve got some momentum,” Cornyn said."

It costs $6.99 to download the game, but you'll also need the $99 Gear VR device in addition to one of several compatible Samsung phones.It was inevitable that Minecraft would make the leap to VR. The game, which has sold 23 million copies of the PC and Mac versions alone, is available on a variety of devices, from smartphones to video game consoles. Microsoft showcased a demo of the game on its upcoming ""HoloLens"" augmented reality device last year. If there's a platform that can run modern games, Minecraft will be there.A promotional video for the new Gear VR version shows familiar gameplay. You navigate a 3D, blocky world, constructing buildings and harvesting materials while dodging enemies or working with friends. But rather than steering your character with a keyboard and mouse, you'll be able to look around in real time simply by moving your head. To move objects and navigate the world, you use a wireless gamepad.Put another way, the entire Minecraft experience will be considerably more immersive in virtual reality.Right now, the number of people with VR headsets is fairly low. While a first-run of the Samsung Gear VR sold out on Amazon and Best Buy when the device launched last year, it's estimated that the headset will only sell 5 million units globally by the end of this year. That's practically nothing compared to the number of Minecraft-ready smartphones in the world, though they've of course had a considerable head start.Most American consumers also don't know much about specific virtual reality devices, according to a recent poll.Still, Minecraft has a well-documented, unique appeal: If anything can get people interested in new technology, it might just be this game."

I couldn’t have even imagined that I would be recognized or celebrated for things that just come natural to me,"" said Hayes, a history teacher at John F. Kennedy High School in Waterbury, Connecticut. Hayes will spend the next year traveling around the country as an advocate for educators, according to the Council of Chief State School Officers, which issued the award.Teaching kids facts and analytical thinking skills isn't enough, she said, adding that she hopes to use her new platform to promote service-learning -- which involves community service activities, teaching kids to use their education for good and showing the importance of being empathetic. ""We spend a lot of time teaching kids to be self-sufficient and high achievers, and I think we really need to spend some time also teaching them: OK, now what do you do with that? What does it mean?

""I think we need to nurture empathy from a very early age.""Hayes teaches in the community where she grew up.

I felt successful. Even when I didn’t go to college immediately after high school, even when I went away, there was always something inside of me where I knew that was a good place. I could always go back,"" she said. Now, she tries to build that foundation for her own students who may be going through struggles. ""We really need to let kids be kids, and let people be people, and teach the person that’s in front of us. Meet them where they are, deal with things as they are -- not where they should be. We have to learn that we have some of the brightest kids in front of us that don’t look like the brightest kids -- but it's in there,"" Hayes said. That's why Hayes tries to celebrate all of her students for all of their accomplishments -- no matter how small. If a student who normally comes to class 15 minutes late shows up only 13 minutes late, she sees that as noteworthy.""We need to find that gift in every single student,"" she explained. ""Whatever they're good at, and keep reminding them every single day that they are so awesome.""Hayes' title puts her in a unique position to meet teachers and policymakers around the country. This has already reminded her of the inequities that exist between schools. As the presidential election approaches, she wants to remind people how important it is to give all students the same resources and opportunities to succeed.Indeed, low-income students tend to have the least experienced teachers, and many high-minority schools receive less funding than others. ""As a country, we really need to have some real talk about equity issues and making sure every student, in every state, and every community, has high-quality education,"" said Hayes, who carries a copy of the Constitution in her purse at all times.

The ride-sharing pioneer stands at the very nexus of pressing questions about technology and work in the app age. In short, the company is one of the biggest and most controversial business stories of our time, which is why HuffPost tries to cover the company's every move.So how can HuffPost readers rely on HuffPost's coverage of Uber going forward, knowing its editor-in-chief has a personal and financial stake in the company's success?According to media ethics experts, the newsroom will have to take precautions to keep readers' trust.""How influential is Arianna Huffington over The Huffington Post?"" Kelly McBride, a media ethicist at the Poynter Institute, asked in earnestness.Quite influential, HuffPost assured McBride.In that case, ""It's definitely a concern,"" McBride said. ""Uber is a massively controversial company, and it's sort of right in the sweet spot for Huffington Post coverage. ... It's a blatant, obvious conflict of interest, and it can be managed.""On Wednesday, Huffington told editors at the site that she was recusing herself from news coverage of Uber. This, according to McBride, was a good first step. Huffington should go further, she said, and designate an editor in charge of all things Uber, and assure that editor and everyone else ""that there's editorial independence to make decisions that serve the audience, not Arianna Huffington or Uber.""Huffington has already done so, she said in an email responding to questions about the board seat. The responsibility to watchdog Uber coverage will fall to Jo Confino, an executive editor overseeing the site's business coverage, who was previously at The Guardian for 22 years. ""Today might be my first day on the Uber board, but I’m in year 11 as Editor-in-Chief of The Huffington Post,"" Huffington said. ""And throughout all of those years HuffPost's editorial independence has been a paramount concern, whether we’re covering people that I or other staffers know personally, or stories involving the interests of our parent companies or involving our advertisers, as is clear from our multi-part Highline series on Johnson & Johnson.""Huffington said every story related to Uber will be accompanied by a disclosure noting that she's on the company's board. According to an email sent out to HuffPost staffers Wednesday, such a disclosure will be attached whether the story subject is Uber, one of its competitors or ride-sharing in general.That disclosure is going to see a lot of action. HuffPost's newspage for Uber indicates that the site often runs multiple posts about Uber each day. Many of these stories ask hard questions about Uber's business practices; as Huffington notes, that includes stories that ran on the site when she already knew she was joining the company's board. (See here, here and here.) Uber's business model famously relies on classifying drivers as independent contractors, rather than employees, in order to save money. Many on the left believe Uber is helping to put downward pressure on working standards in the broader transportation industry.Despite the assurances to staff, one senior editor, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the arrangement ""makes me very uncomfortable."" Given the company's newsworthiness, Huffington's relationship with Uber is problematic, but workable, said Bob Kaiser, the former managing editor at The Washington Post. Kaiser said making a clear disclosure in every story related to Uber would help. He noted that The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, includes a parenthetical disclosure to any coverage of Amazon or other business interests of Bezos.""I wouldn't have joined any board of a commercial enterprise when I was an editor or reporter myself,"" Kaiser said. ""I wouldn't have done it if I were her, but in this corrupt world we live in, this is not an egregious thing. It's modest by my standards.""For as long as there have been newspapers, media moguls have had relationships -- personal or financial -- with powerful businesses and politicians. That was true for William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, and it's true today for the likes of Rupert Murdoch and Michael Bloomberg.What makes Huffington different is that she is not a publisher who resides strictly on the business side. Her title is president and editor-in-chief, making her the site's top-ranking editor. She makes broad decisions related to news, as well as more granular ones, including assigning stories and spiking them. Bezos, for instance, does not regularly join story meetings with editors and reporters or steer coverage. That responsibility is left to the paper's editor, Marty Baron.""I don't think you'd find Marty Baron advocating for another company,"" said Aly Colón, the Knight Professor in Journalism Ethics at Washington and Lee University. McBride said one potential solution would be for Huffington to recuse herself as editor-in-chief, relegating herself to the business side as a publisher. ""When you're editor-in-chief, your job is to serve the editorial mission of the organization,"" she said. ""Which means you do have to set aside some of your personal passions, because they create too many conflicts of interest.""One problem HuffPost could face is the prospect of self-censorship by editors and reporters, McBride said. Even if the staff has assurances it can cover Uber as it normally would, she said, some journalists may be reluctant to pursue stories critical of Uber knowing of their boss' relationship to the company. This is an issue McBride said she often sees in newsrooms in smaller cities and towns, where publishers are friends with local power brokers.""That's really a question about the culture of the organization,"" Kaiser said of self-censorship. ""It shouldn't be. But if there's a culture of intimidation, then it could be.""According to Colón, all the editorial safeguards in the world may not erase some readers' skepticism. In this sense, he says, the very perception of a conflict of interest could saddle the site with a credibility issue on Uber matters. ""It's a challenging situation,"" Colón said. ""It doesn't mean [readers] will cease to trust Huffington Post news about Uber. But it will raise a question for anybody who knows she's on the board.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg: There are more than 100 other such bills pending in 22 states. These measures are causing headaches for politicians in both parties. Republican governors, for example, are having to convince corporations that their states aren't bad for business, despite the decidedly unwelcome message they're sending to broad groups of people. House Democrats held a press conference Thursday reminding everyone that there's an easy way to end these problems: Pass the Equality Act, which would extend federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBT people and make the state-level fights into non-issues. The bill would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of already protected classes (race, color, sex, religion and national origin). In other words, it would protect LGBT people from discrimination in credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial assistance, jury service and public accommodations.""To the extent that state laws come in conflict with that... it would be my judgment that the federal law would take precedence, and it would provide protection at the federal level for individuals and prohibit them from being discriminated [against] based on sexual orientation or gender identity,"" said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who is leading the Equality Act push in the House. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic members joined Cicilline Thursday in calling on Republicans to allow the Equality Act, which was first introduced in July, to move forward. They specifically called on House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) to schedule a hearing. ""When Speaker [Paul] Ryan took office last November, he promised he would return the House to regular order. He said, and I quote: 'The committees should retake the lead in drafting all major legislation. If you know the issue, you should write the bill. Open up the process. Let people participate,'"" Cicilline said. ""We are making this request in good faith,"" he continued. ""This is an opportunity for Speaker Ryan, Chairman Goodlatte and the House Republican Caucus to make good on their commitment to regular order.""Ryan's office referred The Huffington Post to the Judiciary Committee, whose spokesman did not return a request for comment. The Equality Act has more than 210 co-sponsors in the House and the Senate, including two Republicans. In 2013, the Senate passed a bill that would have barred discrimination against LGBT people in the workplace, but the House never took it up."

Ross, who wrote a 2001 book on the integration of the league. Marshall refused to put black players on the team until he was forced to in the 1960s, well after other teams had integrated.

24,BUSINESS,Why ClassPass' Price Increase Is Better For Everyone,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-classpasss-price-increase-is-better-for-everyone_us_5722003ee4b0b49df6aa3fc2,"High prices can weed out those who aren't committed, making a better experience for you.",2016-04-28,ClassPass users in an exercise class at Bonza Bodies Fitness in downtown Denver.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57221b26160000e40031cf5a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For a little while, endorphin addicts across New York City achieved the dream: Cheap, unlimited exercise classes were available almost anywhere at any time with the touch of the button. On Wednesday, that dream came to an end.ClassPass, which charges a monthly fee for people to attend exercise classes without committing to a single gym, is significantly hiking the price of its unlimited passes in New York City. The company is also adding two lower tiers of membership, letting customers take a limited number of classes per month for a smaller fee.Current ClassPass members let out a collective moan across the Internet this week, but the service is following a rather predictable trajectory for a startup: It lured customers in with low prices, found gyms with extra class space (in part because it had enough customers to make that attractive), and brought them together. It now has to turn its sights to balancing the two sides and, hopefully, to actually make money after several rounds of venture capital funding.It may lose some customers as a result of this price hike, but ultimately, that might be the point -- and it might make the service even better for those who stick around. New York, one of the most expensive of the more than 30 cities where ClassPass operates, will see unlimited passes increase to $190 for current members and $200 for new members. That's huge, considering the plan debuted at $99 and slowly crept up to $125. The two cheaper options will offer five classes a month for $75, or 10 classes at $125 for existing members and $135 for new members. ""[A] one-size-fits-all membership is not diverse enough to serve all of our members’ unique needs, which is why we have decided to roll out new plans,"" said Payal Kadakia, the CEO of ClassPass, in an emailed statement to the Huffington Post. ""We wanted an easier entry point for new users who have an appetite for boutique fitness as well as the ability to keep offering an exceptional experience to those who love our unlimited product.""This is to be expected, says Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern Business School and the author of the upcoming book The Sharing Economy.Sundararajan likened ClassPass' new subscription options to mobile data plans, saying: ""We used to pay a fixed amount for unlimited internet on our phones, and now have moved to tiered plans. It's a natural part of the evolution of a business like that.""The problem with ClassPass is that while there may be a huge number of potential new customers in a city like New York, there is limited physical gym space. If ClassPass gets too many customers, it actually hurts its own business. There's an easy, proven way to get fewer customers without losing money: raise prices.""One of the interesting things about marketplaces is sometimes it's the more the merrier: If the market grows larger, everybody is better off,"" said Marina Krakovsky, author of The Middleman Economy: How Brokers, Agents, Dealers, and Everyday Matchmakers Create Value and Profit. Telephone networks, and social networks like Facebook, work that way.""That's not really the case with something like gym memberships,"" Krakovsky said.It's true: Nobody wants to pay to be in a sweaty room so full of people they end up Zumbaing on top of the person next to them.""Classes can get overcrowded,"" said Krakovsky, adding, ""You may be better off having fewer members paying more.""Sundararajan explained that a nascent business like ClassPass might start out not really knowing what the right price is. Thus, it will set prices low to bring in customers and adjust them upward as, over time, it gets a better grasp on how much people actually use the service and how much that costs the company. That seems to be what's happening here. Even though ClassPass is raising prices for unlimited memberships, it won't auto-enroll its current members in that plan unless they opt in. Instead, it will enroll them in the 10 classes per month tier, which is the same price as the unlimited plan was in the past. ""The majority of our members never exceed 10 classes in a month, so we wanted to provide an option more in line with their needs,"" the company said in its statement.""Customers are going to be unhappy, naturally, because they feel like it’s a bait and switch,"" said Krakovsky. ""But at the same time, it’s not like they’re locked in. If someone doesn’t like it they can walk away, they’re not any worse off than they would be without ClassPass."""

Bush, who said something similar about the tax proposals of his rival Ronald Reagan in 1980. Bush, who eventually became president in 1989, accused Reagan of peddling a “voodoo economic policy” for claiming that he could enact across-the-board tax cuts and still balance the budget thanks to the economic growth the cuts would spur. Of course, Reagan won the nomination and then the election, and in the process, reshaped the political balance of power in the country. Obama acknowledged that could be why Republican presidential hopefuls today push tax cuts as an economic and budgetary cure-all, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Republican front-runner Donald Trump’s tax plan would reduce federal government revenues by $9.5 trillion over a decade, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. That would trigger an increase in the national debt of 80 percent of GDP by 2036 if there were not also massive spending cuts. The tax cuts Trump’s rival Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) proposes would reduce federal revenue by $8.6 trillion over a decade -- and go disproportionately to the wealthiest Americans, according to the Tax Policy Center.Obama argued that this particular orthodoxy left over from Reagan's presidency must end for sane policy to prevail.“If we can’t puncture some of the mythology around austerity, politics or tax cuts or the mythology that’s been built up around the Reagan revolution, where somehow people genuinely think that he slashed government and slashed the deficit and that the recovery was because of all these massive tax cuts, as opposed to a shift in interest-rate policy -- if we can’t describe that effectively, then we’re doomed to keep on making more and more mistakes,” he told the Times."

His parents figured college was the next step, but that dream was nearly cut short in his first semester. Miscommunication with a professor resulted in an argument over handing in a paper he wasn’t finished with. Richard stormed in and out of the classroom several times, trying to retrieve the paper. The incident left the professor feeling afraid, some students in the room shouting at Richard and college administrators unsure whether to bar him from classes.Richard is on the autism spectrum. There are ways to manage intense reactions such as his, but — like most people — neither the professor nor the students in that class knew anything about them. The increase in the number of young people diagnosed with autism in the last 14 years has been staggering — from one in 152 in 2002 to an estimated one in 68 today. Funding and focus for autism have remained centered on helping younger kids cope. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of children like Richard turn 18 every year. (Students in this story all asked to be identified by their first names only.) They are often as smart as or smarter than their peers, but they go to college in far fewer numbers. They are even less likely to go to college than people with most other disabilitiesOnly a few dozen colleges have programs specifically designed to support students with autism, a recent study found. Many of the programs that do exist cost thousands of dollars per semester, on top of tuition. But there are practical and inexpensive methods to help these hundreds of thousands of students navigate the social and academic landmines that stymie them. Failing to help likely consigns them, as adults, to low-wage jobs, dependence on public assistance or ongoing reliance on their parents — who may also be struggling and are unlikely to outlive them.A pilot program on five campuses at the City University of New York, where the number of students who disclosed that they are on the spectrum has more than doubled since 2012, has shown promising results.Most CUNY students are low-income, and almost 40 percent come from households with incomes below $20,000 a year. The pilot program was implemented at no cost to students, and, for the most part, students participating in it over the last four years have been more likely to stay enrolled, improve their academic performance (grades for 60 percent of the participants at Kingsborough Community College went up) and report increased satisfaction with their social experience.Faculty who oversee the program, dubbed Project REACH, emphasize that because of the vast differences in the behaviors and abilities of people on the spectrum, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. But the program is built around a combination that works: weekly workshops (which are open to all students with disabilities) and one-on-one peer mentorship seem to meet a lot of students’ needs.Related: More people with autism are getting training for technology jobsNick, a sophomore majoring in psychology, was diagnosed as a little boy with autism and attention deficit disorder. When he was younger he struggled with overwhelming waves of emotion and frustration that sometimes led to screaming and fits of rage that were hard to control. He and his parents chose the College of Staten Island because they heard it was supportive of students on the spectrum.Nick, 19, had an A average in high school and is now in the college’s honors program, where he currently has a 3.14 GPA. Sitting in the psychology department in a gray T-shirt and blue sweatpants, lightly tapping his foot, he says he still struggles sometimes.“I know if I could just take a minute out of my day and plan, I’d be so much better. I genuinely get so frustrated with myself,” he said, looking down, his foot-tapping becoming more strenuous and his face contorting, as if he were suddenly awash in that frustration.He put his head down on the table for a moment, and then looked up, focused on the present once again. “REACH helped me, because it made me more confident,” he said. “It made me understand more what autism was, and that made me more relaxed and more able to participate in class.”The group sessions, which simulate an actual class environment, not only teach relevant topics, but also help students work on behaviors that can be problematic in their regular classes, such as being disruptive or not speaking at all.“You can talk at people all you want about social skills,” said Kristen Gillespie-Lynch, assistant professor of psychology and director of Project REACH at CSI, “but there has to be an element of doing it for people to learn it. … That’s why we have the group classes.”The workshops vary depending upon student interest and what the faculty think is needed. Topics have included how to use a syllabus, job interviews and resume writing, as well as social skills. Classes have also discussed self-advocacy, including if, when and how to disclose a disability.  “Initially when I wrote the proposal, I thought we would mostly do social skills, but they weren’t interested,” said Stella Woodroffe, director of Access-Ability Services at Kingsborough Community College, laughing. “It sounded too much like therapy. They’d had enough of it. They wanted more college skills and social events.”Related: Pipeline to Prison: Special education too often leads to jail for thousands of American childrenSome classes discuss characteristics of autism itself.In March, a graduate student teaching a class began with a discussion of “executive functions,” which include planning, organizing your thoughts, and time management — challenging processes for people on the spectrum.

One talked quietly to himself.The instructor recognized the confusion and explained that executive function is similar to how a corporate executive has to operate.

A young woman sitting next to him, who had been completely expressionless since the start of class, suddenly came alive, smiling almost gleefully.The instructor nodded, without pausing for too long, and moved on to describe how executive functions are related to the process of writing a paper, and how to break that process into smaller steps, to make it less overwhelming.A few students were silent for the entire class, several spoke when prompted and one would have talked during every silence if the instructor hadn’t gently cut her off.James said he found the classes extremely valuable in helping to orient him to what was required and available at college. He moved to Staten Island from a homeless shelter in Florida in seventh grade and was mislabeled as “emotionally disturbed.” He finally got out of special education classes as a junior in high school and, earning decent grades, was accepted to the College of Staten Island. But that was almost 20 years ago, when there were few supports; without sufficient funds or any idea of how to manage financial aid, he dropped out.A state agency advised him to enroll in a clerical certificate program, which he passed. For the next decade or so he held a string of clerical and customer service jobs, his favorite as a security guard at LaGuardia Airport. He knew he needed a college degree, however, to get a job that would pay decently and that he would truly enjoy. He got tuition help from a Catholic charity and, at the age of 39, he will graduate in August with an education degree. He hopes to work with children with disabilities, and recently became a mentor to another student on the spectrum.“I help them to recognize when people are reacting and why, what activities to get involved in, what clubs are welcoming,” said James, sitting in the campus student center before going to a meeting of the A.L.P.H.A. Club, which helps arrange community service projects and social activities on campus.Barbara Bookman, director of Project REACH at CUNY, said the mentorships allow for an individualized approach, which is particularly helpful for students on the spectrum, who can have a wide range of challenges. She recalled a mentor at La Guardia Community College who developed a dictionary of sorts for one student, who, like many people on the spectrum, understood things very literally and would get confused by some professors’ use of language.A “professor told the class one day to have their eyes open and their mouths zipped,” said Bookman, who is also director of program relations and professional development at CUNY. “It was confusing. The student’s response was, ‘I don’t have a zipper on my mouth.’ ”Autism experts say that the peer mentor model is one of the best.“For a new student in college who’s just really landed on another planet, it’s like, ‘ok, here’s what you do, here’s what you need to know,’ and it’s especially useful if it’s somebody who has autism or is a peer,” said Naomi Angoff Chedd, a therapist at the Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Stony Brook University. “Things like, ‘This is how you avoid the construction site, this is how to get a seat near the window, these are the professors who are more understanding or are on the spectrum themselves.’ It’s just practical things that staff may not think of.""

He can empathize with what they go through, he said, especially since he was mercilessly bullied in middle school.He mentored a student last fall who had transferred from York College in Queens (which has no specific autism program) after failing all his classes.“It was hard to get him to open up at first,” admitted Cheriyan.Change in routine was difficult for the young man, as it can be for many people on the spectrum. Cheriyan saw that the student was taking 12 pages of notes for each chapter of a book. When he suggested that it might be more effective to selectively scale back a bit, the mentee seemed unconvinced. But after almost failing his mid-term, he listened to Cheriyan, who showed him how to focus more on what the professor said in class, instead of writing everything down from each chapter. He reduced his notes to five pages per chapter. He also agreed to use a computer program that could scan a book and read it aloud, allowing him to take notes while listening. He brought his grade up on the next exam and managed to pass his classes.Autism experts note that one of the most challenging things about college for some students on the spectrum is the abrupt shift in support. In high school they may have had an aide assigned to go to classes with them, as part of the special education services to which they were entitled. And many were likely not even present at the legally required meetings with secondary school leaders to determine what services they needed; their parents attended instead, since communication can be one of the toughest challenges for many on the spectrum.In college, things change. Students must, on their own, identify themselves as having a disability and ask for the accommodations and services they need. It is up to them whether to disclose their conditions to anyone on campus.“That’s one of the biggest changes and challenges for students with disabilities when they enter college,” said Joanne D’Onofrio, associate director of the Center for Student Accessibility at CSI. “They have to learn to be effective self-advocates and they may never have learned those skills when they were in high school.”CUNY’s program was financed on a relative shoestring by the private nonprofit FAR Fund.

His parents figured college was the next step, but that dream was nearly cut short in his first semester. Miscommunication with a professor resulted in an argument over handing in a paper he wasn’t finished with. Richard stormed in and out of the classroom several times, trying to retrieve the paper. The incident left the professor feeling afraid, some students in the room shouting at Richard and college administrators unsure whether to bar him from classes.Richard is on the autism spectrum. There are ways to manage intense reactions such as his, but — like most people — neither the professor nor the students in that class knew anything about them. The increase in the number of young people diagnosed with autism in the last 14 years has been staggering — from one in 152 in 2002 to an estimated one in 68 today. Funding and focus for autism have remained centered on helping younger kids cope. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of children like Richard turn 18 every year.

For better or worse, the other weevils are not named after famous movie sidekicks.Researchers said that they named the weevil after the Wookiee because of its dense scales on the head and legs, which ""reminds the authors of Chewbacca’s dense fur.""Not surprisingly, many scientists are nerdy people who love ""Star Wars"" and name their discoveries after characters from the movies.

Ted Cruz.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572207761900002e0056c77c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like most lawmakers in Washington, John Boehner really, really doesn't like Ted Cruz.The former House speaker sat down for an interview at Stanford University on Wednesday where he discussed his previous job and the 2016 election. When asked about his thoughts on the Texas senator vying for the GOP presidential nomination, Boehner made a face and let it fly.“Lucifer in the flesh,” the former speaker said of Cruz, according to The Stanford Daily. “I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.”It's not the first time Boehner has called Cruz ""Lucifer."" He has also referred to the senator, who led the failed effort to defund Obamacare during the speaker's tenure, as a ""jackass."" Boehner was more amiable to the remaining presidential contenders. He called Ohio Gov. John Kasich a ""friend,"" and said he would vote for Donald Trump if the businessman becomes the party's nominee. The former speaker has said he would not vote for Cruz, even if he were the nominee.Asked about Boehner's remarks on Thursday, Cruz said the speaker ""allowed his inner Trump to come out."" He then used the comments to attack the GOP front-runner.""John Boehner in his remarks described Donald Trump as his texting and golfing buddy. So if you want someone that's a texting and golfing buddy, if you're happy with John Boehner, speaker of the House, you want a president like John Boehner -- Donald Trump is your man,"" Cruz told reporters at a press conference in Indiana.But as to his working relationship with Boehner, which the speaker described as decidedly unpleasant, Cruz pleaded ignorance.""I've never worked with John Boehner. Truth of the matter is I don't know the man,"" he said. ""I've met John Boehner two or three times in my life. If i have said 50 words in my life to John Boehner I would be surprised and every one has consisted of pleasantries. 'Good to see you, Mr. Speaker.' I've never had any substantive conversation with John Boehner in any respect.""“When John Boehner calls me Lucifer, he’s not directing that at me, he’s directing that at you,"" he said, referring to the conservative movement that wanted Congress to defund Obamacare.Cruz's dismissal might make sense if not for the fact that the senator was once Boehner's lawyer. But the Texas conservative isn't the only one guilty of spinning tales. Boehner himself once praised Cruz -- albeit in a very public setting during his tenure as speaker.""A good guy. I don't always agree with him, but he's a good guy,"" Boehner said of Cruz in a January 2014 interview on NBC's ""The Tonight Show.""This post has been updated with Cruz's response."

Several of the reforms appear to respond to allegations in a federal complaint filed this year by Faith Ferber, an undergraduate at American.Ferber had to sign a confidentiality agreement before she could participate in a disciplinary hearing for the male student she said sexually assaulted her, according to documents shared with The Huffington Post. Federal guidelines say schools are not allowed to require confidentiality once a sexual misconduct case has been resolved.American's changes are a ""really good start,"" Ferber told HuffPost on Wednesday. But she said she still has concerns after an administrator publicly criticized her for filing the federal complaint accusing AU of violating the gender equity law Title IX.American alumni petitioned for reforms after news reports described how the school handled the assault case involving Ferber. The petition garnered nearly 85,000 signatures in a few weeks.Bianca Palmisano, an alumna who started the petition, met with students and administrators on April 18 to discuss reforms. Changes were forwarded to the university's Sexual Assault Working Group for implementation, the university said.""We made some important, incremental changes to policy with this petition, but more than anything, I know it inspired a lot of advocates working on this issue to keep pushing forward,"" Palmisano said. ""And that's a big win for me.""Days later, however, Gail Hanson, AU's vice president for campus life, told the student newspaper that Ferber's federal complaint ""discourages people from stepping forward, it doesn’t encourage them, and we’ve already seen a little bit of evidence of that.""""If things don’t work for you, everybody here is committed to continuous improvement, you just have to tell us, you don’t have to file a complaint,"" Hanson told the Eagle student newspaper last week. Ferber said such ""victim-blame"" makes her concerned the school ""will always be reactive instead of proactive.""""It shouldn't take 85,000 people watching you to do what's right for your students,"" she said.American confirmed it has agreed to changes listed in the document released by Palmisano, but didn't immediately have additional comment.Ferber's federal complaint pointed out the confidentiality agreement and said the disciplinary hearing in her case was delayed six months because the school didn't want it to interfere with final exams. The student she accused of assaulting her admitted responsibility and received one year on probation, according to Ferber. She said the university told her the student would be banned from Greek life, but he's now in a fraternity. American's planned reforms replace the requirement that students reporting an assault sign a confidentiality agreement with a statement that will be read aloud. The statement will clarify that accusers and the accused in sexual misconduct cases will be able to share their experiences and will guarantee their First Amendment rights are protected. AU also agreed to consider input from accusers when deciding punishment for offenders. Further, the school will not allow students on disciplinary probation to study abroad in an AU-sponsored program or participate in fraternity or sorority membership recruitment. The school said it would consider using Skype to hold ""timely hearings"" and avoid long delays.The school also said students on probation will not be allowed to serve in student government or as elected Greek life officers, though they can belong to a fraternity or sorority. Prior to Ferber's federal complaint, AU was already the subject of a U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation over its handling of sexual assaults.

The days are long. The stress is intense. The sleep is fleeting. The food is plentiful -- and much of it is, well, crap. Many candidates, staffers and the journalists who cover them put on quite a few pounds during the campaign cycle.Clay Aiken, the former American Idol star who ran for a North Carolina congressional seat in 2014, put on 30 during his time on the trail; or, as he put it, ""30 fucking pounds.""How did this happen? He explained in the latest Candidate Confessional podcast.""I ran in a very rural district too, so pretty much every day Bojangles, because you don't get out of the car. I mean, you're in the car all the time. So it was fast food and then of course every event you go to, people have put food out for you. They've prepared food for you. And it is good. But if you don't eat it, you look rude. So I just had to keep stuffing my face. Thirty pounds.""Aiken's Bojangles meal of choice that summer was a four-piece supreme dinner with dirty rice. There were no healthy choices there, he explained. But you did have the option of mentally tricking yourself into believing your calorie intake wasn't so bad.""You convince yourself that it is healthy because it is chicken,"" Aiken said.

He also practiced how to explain his felony drug conviction to potential employers.Earlier in the film, Samuels talks about how, years earlier, he wasn't making enough money to support his mother after she was diagnosed with cancer, and started selling drugs.“I’m just so ashamed to even bring that situation up,” he says in a mock job interview shown in “City of Trees.” “But it did happen, and I learned from my mistakes, and I’m trying to move forward with my life and show that I am a good citizen in society.”His peers applaud his answer.

About 600,000 prisoners are released in the U.S. each year, but their freedom comes with numerous obstacles: Many struggle to secure jobs, adequate wages, credit and housing. About half of those who are released wind up back in prison within three years, according to a Department of Justice study that tracked inmates in 30 states.Those obstacles “can contribute to a cycle of incarceration,” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch wrote last month when she announced the first National Reentry Week, which began this Monday. Reentry programs are part of the key to preparing ex-offenders to rejoin their communities, she wrote. Earlier this week, the DOJ released a reform “roadmap” to bolster reentry programs.While over three-quarters of Green Corps trainees enter the program with criminal records, organizers aren’t exclusively focused on reentry or hiring ex-offenders.

Washington Parks & People aims to combat poverty in some of the city’s impoverished, primarily African-American neighborhoods, both by restoring parks and green spaces so they are safe, vibrant places for the community and by teaching residents the basic skills to qualify for a variety of entry-level jobs in the emerging green economy. The Green Corps has graduated 173 trainees over the last six years. Over 70 percent found jobs or entered education programs within three months. They have planted over 3,000 trees and worked on projects like invasive species removal and stormwater mitigation.The “City of Trees” film shows numerous challenges and conflicts, mirroring common issues for nonprofits. A $2.7 million stimulus grant helped Washington Parks & People launch the training program, but made it difficult to raise other funds after its two-year cycle, and briefly put the program's future in jeopardy.

But officials said the charges against them stemmed from an immigration-related investigation that spun off their probe into the massacre.U.S. Navy veteran Syed Raheel Farook, 31, his wife, Tatiana Farook, 31, and her sister Mariya Chernykh, 26, were arrested by federal agents after being charged with conspiracy to make a false statement to immigration officials while under oath, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement.The investigation found that in 2014 Enrique Marquez, who had been a friend of Syed Rizwan Farook, allegedly agreed in return for payment to marry Chernykh, a Russian citizen, so she could apply for permanent U.S. residency status, charging documents stated.Chernykh also was charged with fraud and two counts of making material false statements to federal agents.Syed Raheel Farook and Tatiana Farook, who like her sister is originally from Russia, staged photos of Marquez and Chernykh to make them look like a married couple and created a joint bank account for the two, according to the charging documents. The Farooks were arrested at their home in Corona while Chernykh was arrested in Ontario."

She has been fighting for women and girls her entire career, and she’s just getting started.""As Clinton said in response to Trump's remarks on Tuesday night, telling the crowd: “If fighting for women’s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in!” Well done, Hillary.

40,BUSINESS,Campbell’s New Parental Leave Policy Is A Big Step Even If It Isn’t The Best,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/campbell-soup-parental-leave_us_57211afae4b0b49df6aa0225,The backstory on why the soup giant is making major changes.,2016-04-28,Campbell CEO Denise Morrison drew from her own difficulties juggling career and parenthood.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57211bbe160000e40031cdda.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Years ago, when Denise Morrison told her boss she planned to take a temporary leave from work to have her first baby, she knew this wouldn’t be welcome news to the higher-ups. She said she was among the first of her female colleagues to have a baby. ""I told my boss, ‘Pretend I have a broken leg,’” Morrison, now president and CEO of the Campbell Soup Company, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. “He said, ‘What?’ and I said, ‘Well, I’m going to be out for about six weeks. I can still read my mail, I can still work, I just can’t go into the stores.’ He looked at me and said, ‘You don’t have a broken leg,’ and I said, ‘Yes, but I’m pregnant.’”Now Morrison is trying to make things easier for the next generation of parents. On Thursday, she announced Campbell’s first company-wide parental leave policy, a gender-neutral package that guarantees 10 paid weeks off for a primary caregiver, and two for a secondary caregiver, after a birth or adoption. The policy is flexible, meaning she has instructed the human resources department to be open to individual arrangements to meet employees’ needs.“We’ve been watching the market,” Morrison said, referring to the groundswell of companies announcing stronger parental leave policies over the last year. “We are all about millennial mothers, and this is really good for consumers. Putting those factors together, I just said it’s time.” It’s not just mothers, though critics say requiring parents to designate a “primary"" caregiver may mean the so-called parental policy will still effectively be about women. Offering less time to the “secondary” caregiver -- in most cases, the father -- can also make it harder for primary caregivers to restart their careers after going on leave. A recent study of 22,000 companies around the world found that countries with the highest percentages of women in leadership, including at the boardroom and executive levels, offered fathers 11 times more paternity leave days than countries with the lowest percentages of female leaders.Still, Campbell’s gender-neutral program may be more welcoming to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer families.“Families today are a mosaic,” Morrison said. “Families will decide different roles in their lives. The expectation is that we as a company will be flexible.”Campbell’s new policy may be inclusive, but it’s still not particularly generous. Netflix, which last year ignited corporate focus on parental leave with its own new policy, offers up to a year off. Facebook provides four months for moms and dads. Music streaming giant Spotify gives up to six months of leave. Etsy, the hand-crafted goods seller, announced a “basically perfect” policy last month, offering men and women up to 26 paid weeks off. Even The Nation, a magazine struggling with the drop in print advertising, now gives staffers up to 16 weeks of paid parental leave.What makes Campbell’s move notable is that the company is a 147-year-old food giant, not exactly a cultural bedfellow with 21st-century tech firms or leftist magazines. The parental leave announcement marks yet another step in the Camden, New Jersey-based behemoth’s transformation under Morrison.In many ways, that journey began with the acquisition of baby-food brand Plum Organics in June 2013.Campbell bought the startup just as Plum was seeking to become certified as a so-called benefit corporation. Benefit corporations must meet the rigid environmental and social good standards outlined by the nonprofit B Lab. The designation provides companies with the same thing that LEED certification brings buildings: a public indicator that they're one of the good guys. A month after Campbell's acquisition, Plum became the first benefit corporation ever owned by a public company.“In doing that, it set a higher standard for our whole company,” Morrison said. “There’s been a steady drumbeat of change.”Until now, that change has been most evident in Campbell's food policies. Last July, the company vowed to remove all artificial flavors and colors from its foods by 2018. In January, the company said it would begin labeling all U.S. food products that contain genetically modified organisms and even publicly advocated for a national mandatory GMO label. As the name implies, Plum Organics built its brand selling non-GMO foods.Campbell’s parental leave announcement marks the first major initiative that emulates the way its Plum subsidiary treats its workers.Plum Organics had offered eight weeks of paid maternity leave and two weeks of paid paternity leave. Now, women or men who are primary caregivers at Plum can take 10 paid weeks off. Though secondary caregivers' leave remains unchanged at two weeks, the gender designations go away. “We think about our benefits for parents holistically, meaning we’re not just looking at parental leave -- we’re also doing everything we can to make sure our employees are being fully supported once they’re back in the office,” a Plum Organics spokeswoman told HuffPost.Campbell may be getting with that part of the program, too. The company plans to expand the daycare nursery at its Camden headquarters, which has been there for the last 25 years. A Campbell spokeswoman declined to comment on other pending workplace initiatives.“If we make it easier and more flexible for women and men to have good careers and good families,” Morrison said, “then that’s a step in the right direction.”Still, as HuffPost’s Emily Peck explained last year, corporate America has a long way to go.Yet for all the positive momentum on leave, the data still looks bleak. An overwhelming majority of employers don’t offer paid leave. Most states don’t offer paid leave. The U.S. unpaid leave law — the Family and Medical Leave Act — only covers 60 percent of workers.So, for now, change may have to come on a company-by-company basis. “I talk publicly about the seismic shifts happening not only in demographics but in family,” Morrison said. “For the first time at Campbell, we’re seeing that shift live in our workforce and in our world headquarters and now company-wide.”"

As a college coach, he set a record for wins, led the Hoosiers to three NCAA Championships, won a dozen other college championships and was named Big Ten Coach of the Year eight times. He also coached the U.S. Men's Olympic Team, Texas Tech and U.S. Army. But his conquest of college sports came with heavy doses of controversy and aggression. He was charged and convicted in absentia of assaulting a police officer in Puerto Rico during the 1979 Pan American Games, famously threw a chair across the court during a 1985 game, manhandled players and fans, and was not always friendly with the press and refs. He was fired from his position at Indiana in 2000 over his ""unacceptable pattern of behavior,"" which included verbal attacks on a female university official, and allegations that he choked a former player.Trump said earlier this week that he would like it if Knight endorsed his campaign. “Tough, strong, smart. I would like to get that for Indiana, I’ll tell you what. To me, that would be a great endorsement,” Trump said.Last night, Ted Cruz (R-Texas) chose basketball as his avenue to connect with Indiana voters. Cruz tried to recreate a famous scene from the iconic basketball movie “Hoosiers,” but it didn’t work out that well.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) is at far left.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democrats spent much of Wednesday reminding Republicans that mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus are now spreading to the U.S. In fact, there are already a good number present in 30 states. “The mosquitoes are coming,” Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) told reporters. “The mosquitoes are already here. You can’t build a fence to keep them out, and the mosquitoes won’t pay for it. The mosquitoes are here -- this is not a [President Barack] Obama fantasy.”A handful of House Democrats joined their Senate counterparts to put pressure on Republicans regarding a $1.9 billion request by the White House to combat the virus, which causes microcephaly and other fetal brain defects. Senate Republicans signaled interest last week in working with Democrats to push through emergency funding for Zika, which is threatening thousands of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said this week that appropriators are working to get to the right number. Republicans are floating less than the amount Obama requested, but more than $1 billion.Democrats want the full amount. With little chance of a vote on emergency funding ahead of Congress' break next week, Democrats lined up to vent their frustrations.“Senate Republicans finally said last week they were willing to work with us,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). “I was encouraged by our conversations. But it has been nearly a week since we have had those conversations.” Republicans are now trying to find offsets for emergency Zika funding to appease members within their conference, and are also considering attaching Zika funds to the appropriations process. Democrats are opposed to both approaches, arguing that the appropriations process is too slow and that offsets are unnecessary. “If this is not an emergency, there is nothing that is,” said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). “No floods, no earthquake, no fire, nothing will be an emergency if this isn’t.”Reid added that he has yet to see a piece of paper with a specific dollar amount from Republicans. He wouldn’t say whether Democrats would accept a slightly smaller amount than what they've already asked for.“We are down to budget priorities that cannot be cut further,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said.“We are less than 100 days out from the Olympics in Brazil,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.). “We should have acted long ago. This is a true emergency.”Brazil has been devastated by the virus, recording 91,000 new cases of Zika this year alone. Speaking to The Huffington Post, DeLauro added that health officials have voiced serious concern over the upcoming Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.“Our athletes will be frightened when they go,” DeLauro said. “Their families will be frightened. If there is anything that can be determined between now and then that they can avail themselves of in order to protect themselves, then let’s get to it.”The only way athletes and others traveling to Brazil will be prepared, DeLauro said, is if emergency money is made available for research, diagnostics and vaccines. What kind of tone are health officials displaying in meetings? DeLauro summed it up in one word -- ""anxiety.""Earlier this month, officials said they would start to redirect over $500 million that Congress had already approved to battle Ebola. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that if Congress did not provide emergency money for Zika, officials would need to dip into pots for research on malaria and tuberculosis."
