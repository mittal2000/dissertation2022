Yet with beautiful beaches, perfect weather, friendly people, fresh food and a lively downtown, it's easy to see why San Diego has been named ""America's Finest City."" This summer provides an excellent opportunity to explore the diverse neighborhoods of San Diego and to discover for yourself why this West Coast paradise is an ideal place to visit. 1. Downtown San Diego The San Diego International airport is one of the most conveniently situated airports in the world, as it is located right next to the city's downtown district. With hotels, restaurants, nightlife and attractions, Downtown San Diego is a good place for business travelers to hang their coats at one of the Convention Center or Harbor View hotels. An easy way to become familiar with the city's attractions is by climbing on board the San Diego Trolley. The tour allows you to hop on and off at any of the trolley's stops: Old Town San Diego State Historic Park, Midway Aircraft Carrier Museum, Seaport Village, Gaslamp Quarter and William Heath Davis House. Once you have learned about the Mexican-American heritage in the area, get out and enjoy the beautiful outdoors. Embark on a whale watching expedition or attend a Padres game. Be sure to set aside plenty of time to visit the World Famous San Diego Zoo as well as the museums and gardens of Balboa Park.  Balboa Park.

Eat at the hip and hearty Prepkitchen and pay a visit to one of the watering holes around the corner. List of events in downtown San Diego Little Italy. Photo by Suchet Rawal2. Coronado Island Catch a ferry and cross over the picturesque Coronado Bridge, an ideal place to take in a view of the downtown skyline and sailboats in the San Diego Harbor. Get a feel for this charming small town within a big city as you stroll through the island's boutique shops, restaurants and cafes. Coronado Bridge. Photo by Sucheta RawalNext, check in at the most historic hotel in the city, Hotel Del Coronado. Built in 1886, the property has been renovated with modern amenities and spacious guestrooms while preserving landmark architectural elements, including the original Otis elevator. The Del (as it's called) has hosted many famous visitors, including U.S. Presidents Harrison, Taft, Carter, Roosevelt, Reagan, Nixon and Ford as well as famous authors and Hollywood actors. It was also the backdrop of the movie Some Like It Hot starring the ravenous Marilyn Monroe. The resort is equipped to meet every need of a relaxing family vacation. The on-premise spa, salon, fitness center, swimming pools, restaurants, coffee shop, ice cream parlor, candy store, shopping arcade, history lane, gift shops and children's activity center give guests no reason to leave the property. In addition, Hotel Del's sandy backyard was named ""America's #1 Beach"" and is the perfect place to build a castle, search for seashells or swim in the sea. Yoga, surf and paddle-boarding lessons are offered right at the beach. Hotel Del Coronado.

Finish with the decadent molten chocolate cake with poached cherries, toasted almonds and vanilla ice cream. 3. La Jolla  Drive north for thirty minutes to arrive at the quiet residential area of La Jolla. This is where you will find California's famous bluffs and caves that harbor hundreds of seals and sea lions. Stay at Grande Colonial Hotel, a historic boutique hotel located on Prospect Street with direct access to quaint neighborhood shops and restaurants. Completed in 1928, this European-designed hotel has received countless accolades for its preservation efforts and has been affectionately named ""La Jolla's Jewel."" Large and sophisticated rooms overlook the Pacific Coast and take you back to an era where only the finest crystals, glass and mahogany were used to create an intimate and luxurious ambiance.

Since opening, the restaurant has garnered numerous awards for featuring America's best food and wine. Modern California cuisine led by award-winning Chef Jason Knibb and Pastry Chef Rachel King emphasize a market-driven, farm-to-table philosophy with locally made cheeses, artisanal breads and an award-winning wine cellar.

Drawing on inspirations from Italy, Spain and Morocco, the architectural elements of the pavilions and gardens create a magical ambiance for weddings, honeymoons and romantic getaways.

1,COMEDY,Pete Holmes Reveals New Stand-Up And TV Plans After Just Losing His Show,Tyler McCarthy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pete-holmes-show-comedy_n_5499717.html,,2014-06-16,"NEW YORK, NY - MAY 19: Comedian Pete Holmes poses backstage at the 18th Annual Webby Awards on May 19, 2014 in New York City. (Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images for The Webby Awards)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad3a443c000032000b1c50.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been about three weeks since it was announced that “The Pete Holmes Show” would not be picked up for a third run on TBS. But the series' host is shockingly optimistic about the opportunities the job opened up for him. “In the weirdest sense of the word, it’s really a dream come true. I know I’m supposed to be moping around and feeling bad for myself,” Holmes told The Huffington Post. “It’s nice to have this calling card and be able to open the door and see who wants to play.”(Story continues below.)A Men's Wearhouse sketch from a November episode of Holmes' TBS series. He has previously expressed some regret that his show didn't last more than 80 episodes, but he seems sanguine about the idea of moving on and excited to begin something new.“We have ideas for things as far out as an animated show or a narrative show or some kind of scripted story thing. I’m interested in things that can kind of tell different types of stories, not necessarily the best bit,” Holmes told HuffPost. “I’m intrigued by the idea of doing something different. I feel like we went out with a redhead and it didn’t work out. Now I’m interested in dating a brunette or something. Metaphorically, that is.”As he continues to toy with new show ideas, he remains a stand-up comedian above all else. From Holmes’ 2013 Comedy Central special ""Nice Try The Devil.""He told HuffPost that he had put together a new hour of stand-up before “The Pete Holmes Show” began back in October of 2013. However, he never bothered to record it.“Just after my previous special, ‘Nice Try The Devil,’ I had a new hour. So when people were coming to see me back then, I had a brand new hour already,” Holmes said. “Now, we used some of that hour on [""The Pete Holmes Show""]. For example, the Enrique Iglesias monologue on the first episode was from my new hour. So some of it got used in the show, but the parts that didn’t get used are about 30-40 minutes long. It doesn’t have the structure of an act just yet. There’s an opener and stuff to go in the middle, but I don’t know if I have the 3 or 4 big closers. Ideally, I like to have a big joke or piece every 15 minutes.”He still has about 30 - 40 minutes of un-taped material that he never used on his show. His hope is to combine that with new material to create what he calls a ""super hour"" in the near future. Holmes also said he’s been doing new stand-up more frequently since his show was cancelled. This is an impressive feat, as his show consisted of a new monologue of fresh stand-up four nights a week. One of Holmes’ personal favorite stand-up monologues from “The Pete Holmes Show.""“A lot of it is that I need to feel it to hit it. So if I’m talking about something that happened a year ago, it just doesn’t feel as good. I have a bit about green eggs and ham going through airport security. I think it’s really funny, but I honestly don’t think I could do it now. Only because it happened so long ago, I just don’t feel it. It’s like the memory of a memory,” he said. “What I liked about TV and what I think I became a little addicted to, was doing it and having it go up immediately. Then I could just move on.” When it comes to the show’s cancellation, Holmes continues to express how grateful he is for the 80 episodes he was allowed to make.“There’s no part of me that thinks we f***ed up,” he said. “Everything we did was what we wanted it to be, and we did it for less money in less time than should be humanly possible. Everyone I care about -- including people I look up to, and the press, and most importantly my peers -- have said good things, and I really just feel like I knocked it out of the park.”Fans will be pleased to know that TBS is allowing Holmes to keep all of his show’s content on his personal YouTube channel, so the entire library of sketches, interviews and monologues will exist online forever. This should tide fans over until he completes his next hour of material or lands a new TV deal. The final episode of ""The Pete Holmes Show"" airs June 19 on TBS. You can listen to his podcast ""You Made It Weird"" on the Nerdist network almost every week."
2,WORLDPOST,The Pudding in Ed Miliband's Head,"Christina Patterson, ContributorFreelance writer, columnist and broadcaster",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-pudding-in-ed-miliban_b_5499724.html,"Confidence can be very nice, but when you go to see a brain surgeon, you care an awful lot more about skill. If Ed Miliband has the skills to run a country, he certainly hasn't shown it.",2014-06-16,"Labour Leader Ed Miliband arrives at Isa Money Centre in Motherwell, Scotland, ahead of a public meeting with local community activists and undecided voters at the Isa Money Centre in Motherwell, Scotland.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc138792400003600381590.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you're going to wreck someone else's dreams, you'd better have a pretty good excuse. Sometimes, it can't be helped. Sometimes, eggs have to be broken to make delicious meringues, even if one of those eggs turns out to be your brother. You have to break those eggs, because, although you've never actually made a meringue, you know you've got it in you to make the most delicious meringue in the world.To be honest, most of us don't think like this. Some of us, for example, know that we can just about make an edible meal if we have to, but we also know that we're not likely to win The Great British Bake Off, even if we'd ever watched it, which we haven't. We know, because it's now more important to know the rules of TV talent shows than of European elections, that you can only win a competition for making puddings if the pudding you make is pretty damn good. You can't win a competition for making puddings just because you think you might be good at puddings. The proof of the pudding, as William Camden said in Remaines of a Greater Worke, Concerning Britaine, is in the eating. The proof of the pudding isn't the image you have of a pudding in your head.When Ed Milband won the Labour leadership contest four years, after losing the first three rounds and scraping in on the fourth, he must have had a very nice pudding in his head. It might, perhaps, have been one of those big, squashy meringues you get in artisan bakeries near Hampstead Heath. (To live near an artisan bakery, it helps to have a house that's worth £2.3m, a property ""portfolio"" of £4.5m, and an annual household income of about £340,000, but Ed seems to have all of these, so he doesn't need to worry about that.) Perhaps the meringues were served with some kind of mascarpone crema, gently sweetened with Manuka honey, and with some of those big, fat raspberries you get at the farmers' market, down the road.Perhaps, in fact, Ed Miliband has only ever bought food at a farmers' market, which is why he has no idea how much things cost in a normal shop. Perhaps he has only ever had bircher muesli with grated apple for breakfast, which is why he lost all motor skills when he had to face a bacon roll. Ed Miliband didn't eat the bacon roll in the way you'd normally eat a bacon roll: on your way to work, with a handful of Nurofen and a sachet of Resolve. He ate it in front of a big group of photographers, just before the local and European elections, in a flower market at 6.30am. Perhaps he thought it was the kind of thing you'd eat if you were working class. Or perhaps he thought it was a way of sending out a message about immigration. I'm the child of immigrants, he might be saying to people who don't want their children to get halal school meals, but look at me! I eat your food. I feel your pain.The trouble was that it was his pain we felt as he sank his big teeth into a thick wodge of meat, and felt the grease dribbling down his chin. If you want to see a picture, you can find it here. It's hard to know why his eyes looked like the Devil's when he took that bite, or why his mouth looked like the mouth of someone who had just had a lobotomy and was trying hard to remember his own name. Perhaps his advisors had been telling him that zombies were now a big thing. (Like, for example, the ""zombies"", with white faces and bandaged limbs, who recently marched past my flat. When I asked them why they were marching, they said they were trying to stop a Sainsburys from opening across the road. I was thrilled to hear that a Sainsburys might be opening across the road and told them I'd be happy to organise a march to hurry it up.)Perhaps Ed Miliband ate the bacon sandwich for the same reason he this week posed with a copy of The Sun. It wasn't clear whether this meant that the war he said he had launched on Rupert Murdoch was over, or whether it was more like the war in Syria, where everyone says it's terrible, but nobody does anything at all. It looked as though he posed with The Sun because The Sun was supporting the England football team, even though everyone knows that ""our"" chances of winning the World Cup are about the same as Nick Clegg's of moving into Number 10.When you look as though you shop in artisan bakeries, and spend your evenings talking about ""predistribution"", it might seem like quite a good idea to look as though you'll be watching the World Cup. You might, for example, have had quite a few lectures from backbenchers about the fact that your party's messages didn't seem to be ""playing"" all that well with people who were once a bit embarrassed to vote for a man called Tony but can now vote for a man called Nigel with no shame.But when you do decide to pose with a copy of The Sun, it's probably a good idea not to look as though you're in a video made by Somali pirates, and are trying to pretend, for your family's sake, that your kidnappers are treating you well. And when lots of people in Liverpool, and most of your party activists, think this is a betrayal, it's probably better not to say that you're sorry ""if"" you've caused offence. If, a quarter of a century after it happened, people won't accept a real apology from The Sun, for telling lies about people who died, it doesn't seem all that likely that they'll accept an apology that isn't an apology from someone for something he did a few hours before.Perhaps what people in Liverpool saw, which is what everyone else in the country would also have seen, was a man who seems very, very unhappy in his own skin. This is a man who says he has a lot of ""intellectual confidence"" and then hires very expensive people to tell him what to say. He's a man who says he wants to help the ""squeezed middle"", but who seems to think (in this interview, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11848303) that ""the middle"" is 88 per cent.. He's a man who says he wants to transform the country, but whose only policy, after four years, seems to be to tell energy companies to fix their rates.This country has the fastest growing economy in Western Europe. It has more people in work than since records began. If Ed Miliband thinks he can do better than that, we'd all be very pleased, but since the election is less than a year away, he'd better give us a tiny hint about how.Confidence can be very nice, but when you go to see a brain surgeon, you care an awful lot more about skill. If Ed Miliband has the skills to run a country, he certainly hasn't shown it. Whatever vision he had when he trod on his brother's dreams -- and probably broke his mother's heart -- is still stuck in his head. Perhaps he has a brilliant plan. Perhaps he'll tell us, without sounding like a robot or looking like a zombie, what it is. At the moment, it seems to be something along the lines of: I haven't yet worked out the recipe, but let them eat meringue.______________ Christina Patterson blogs at ""Independent Thinking."""

(AP Photo/Don Ryan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae4f472100003100c6d179.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The first government examination of a radical new tuition model called ""Pay It Forward"" was presented to lawmakers in Oregon last week, explaining for the first time how much a state would pay to implement the new system.Sending 4,000 students to college without a tuition bill would cost the state of Oregon $5 to $20 million a year for two decades, the Oregonian reports. Representatives from the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission laid out their examination of the costs of a pilot program to state lawmakers:If Oregon were to allow 1,000 students a year to start college on a tuition-free path in fall 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, and then allow them to complete as much undergraduate work as they can on that same tuition-free deal, the state would have to pay $6.5 million in the first year, $20 million at the peak in 2020 and amounts between those figures over 20 years, officials said.Under the Pay It Forward model, students attend public colleges without a tuition bill with the understanding they will send a small percentage of their income for a set number of years. Usually, depending on whose proposal you're looking at, it's around 3 to 5 percent for about 20 years. A graduate who has a low income during this period wouldn't pay much for their degree, while successful and wealthy degree holders will pay more, the same way income taxes work.Since Oregon's legislature unanimously passed a bill calling for an official study of implementing Pay It Forward in summer 2013, a number of other states have considered similar legislation.However, the Oregon legislature is already allocating roughly $700 million in each biennial budget toward community colleges and the state's university system. Adding $20 million would still keep appropriation levels below where they were in 1999, when enrollment was much smaller."

Tutu received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 in recognition of his leadership, as General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches, of the nonviolent resistance campaign to challenge apartheid.In granting the peace Nobel to Tutu, the Nobel committee wrote [my emphasis]:The Committee has attached importance to Desmond Tutu's role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa. The means by which this campaign is conducted is of vital importance for the whole of the continent of Africa and for the cause of peace in the world.  [...] This year's award should be seen as a renewed recognition of the courage and heroism shown by black South Africans in their use of peaceful methods in the struggle against apartheid. This recognition is also directed to all who, throughout the world, use such methods to stand in the vanguard of the campaign for racial equality as a human right.As a leader of the nonviolent struggle against apartheid, Tutu championed divestment - efforts to pressure U.S. institutions to sell their investments in companies doing business in South Africa and supporting apartheid by doing so. Here's what Tutu is saying now about the prospect of Presbyterian divestment from the Israeli occupation: [my emphasis]:As the Presbyterian General Assembly gathers for its biennial meeting I reach out in prayer and solidarity that the Assembly will make a strong witness for reconciliation, justice and peace. I am aware that the Assembly will consider eight overtures on the confounding and intractable conflict in Israel and Palestine, however I am especially urging the Assembly to adopt the overture naming Israel as an apartheid state through its domestic policies and maintenance of the occupation, and the overture calling for divestment of certain companies that contribute to the occupation of the Palestinian people. Both are worthy of adoption, by speaking truth in the first instance, and owning up to the Church's complicity in maintaining the occupation through its investments in the second.My Just Foreign Policy colleague Megan Iorio and I are in Detroit this week, working to help lift up the diverse voices - Christian, Jewish, and Muslim, Palestinian and Israeli - speaking to Presbyterians in favor of divestment from the Israeli occupation. On Sunday evening, we had the opportunity to speak with Rev. Don Wagner, a Presbyterian minister who has been a leader for decades in efforts to end the occupation and defend the human rights of Palestinians. I asked Rev. Wagner: what's the most important thing that you think we should be telling people right now about this debate? His answer: tell people about Archbishop Tutu's statement in support of Presbyterian divestment from the Israeli occupation. You can join Archbishop Tutu and Rev. Wagner in calling on the Presbyterians to choose divestment here. "

Friday 6th June is the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings which saw 156,000 troops from the allied countries including the United Kingdom and the United States join forces to launch an audacious attack on the beaches of Normandy, these assaults are credited with the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany. A series of events commemorating the 70th anniversary are planned for the week with many heads of state travelling to the famous beaches to pay their respects to those who lost their lives.

But the truth is that Obama's recent reluctance to use military force makes good sense in a complex world in which the United States can't control all events or put out every fire. He should stick to that approach in dealing with the current crisis in Iraq.  The most hopeful aspect of President Obama's foreign policy approach has been his instinct to rebalance U.S. foreign policy after what he has described as ""a long season of war."" His administration has made progress in that direction by getting out of Iraq and substantially reducing the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. While doing so, he has resisted calls for military intervention in Syria or saber rattling over Russia's actions in Ukraine. And rather than giving in to those who were pressing for military action in Iran, he has engaged in negotiations that may end up curbing Tehran's nuclear program without a shot being fired.  President Obama now faces tough choices over how to respond to the advance of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Iraq, but it is worth remembering that it is not a problem of his making. A major part of the problem is the sectarian regime in Baghdad that the United States helped install after the Bush administration and its supporters in Congress decided to launch a costly war in Iraq.  Contrary to the calls from Sen. John McCain and others to use military force in Iraq, it is extremely unlikely that sending arms or dropping bombs can extricate Iraq from a crisis that has been sparked by the repressive actions of the al-Maliki government. In fact, if U.S. bombing were to result in civilian casualties or the deaths of allied forces, it could make matters worse by handing a propaganda victory to ISIS while adding to the needless killing already under way in Iraq. The Obama administration is in the midst of deciding whether to engage in drone strikes or other military action in support of the al-Maliki regime. President Obama should resist the pressure to do so.  A reluctance to use military methods -- from sending troops, to dropping bombs, to providing weapons -- is a strength, not a weakness. The history of post-World War II U.S. foreign policy demonstrates that even seemingly low-risk propositions like arming the rebels fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan can end up threatening long-term U.S. security. Many of the fighters that received U.S. weapons and training in the Afghan war against Soviet aggression went on to join Al Qaeda or other terrorist organizations that have killed U.S. citizens and attacked U.S. allies -- a classic case of ""blowback.""  It is also important to remember that military force is irrelevant to many of the most urgent threats we face. Actions like President Obama's recent decision to curb emissions from coal plants can have important foreign policy implications, strengthening the United States' hand in persuading other countries to reduce their own carbon footprints. Climate change is a perfect example of the kind of pervasive threat to our lives and livelihoods that must be dealt with cooperatively, and that has no military solution. Unlike his predecessor, President Obama has decided to do something about it, even in the face of strong Congressional resistance and a significant undercurrent of climate denial in the body politic.  If there is a weak point in Obama's foreign policy vision, it is that although he is less likely to use force than his predecessor was, he still sees virtually every global problem as requiring some level of U.S. involvement. And he is still too attached to drone strikes and the use of Special Forces, tools that run the risk of embroiling the U.S. in a series of ""small"" wars and undermining our standing in the international community.   If we are to solve our myriad domestic problems and revitalize our economy we need to be more selective about our involvement in foreign crises large and small. The president should embrace that truth in his remaining years in office. For starters, that means staying out of Iraq.  William D. Hartung is the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy."

Once a vibrant, mixed city considered a bastion of support for President Bashar Assad, the eastern city of Raqqa is now a shell of its former life, transformed by al-Qaida militants into the nucleus of the terror group's version of an Islamic caliphate they hope one day to establish in Syria and Iraq. In rare interviews with The Associated Press, residents and activists in Raqqa describe a city where fear prevails, music has been banned, Christians have to pay religious tax in return for protection and face-veiled women and pistol-wielding men in jihadi uniforms patrol the streets. (AP Photo/militant website, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc138792300003200d0b21f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The startling developments in northern Iraq, where the militant group the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) has taken control of Mosul and other cities, highlights several troubling trends that have been evident across much of the Arab world for years.ISIS moved into Mosul and other cities swiftly and without any real combat because these underlying trends all played their role in this great unfolding drama that speaks to the troubling realities of the Arab world.This is about much more than any individual issue such as spillover from Syria, lack of Western military assistance to anti-Bashar Assad rebels, growing sectarian tensions in Iraq, or the spread of extremist Islamist militancy. Iraq today has reached a momentous moment of reckoning for the weaknesses of modern Arab statehood and governance. External factors certainly played their roles, such as the Anglo-American war on Iraq in 2003, decades of Israeli meddling in Arab conditions, and Iran's growing influence in the region.These external factors, however, could only impact on conditions in Iraq because of the underlying structural problems whose consequences are now playing out before us every day. These underlying Arab-made structural problems include corrupt and incompetent governance, weak citizenship, brittle statehood, and a severe lack of cohesion among different ethnic and sectarian groups within countries.The news that many locals have not resisted, and even often welcomed, the arrival of ISIS should clarify the intense problems that existed between the government and mostly Sunni local communities in northwest Iraq. Air attacks by the Iraqi government or military moves by foreign powers such as Iran or the United States will momentarily delay the expansion of ISIS-controlled areas. But military power in the long run remains helpless in the face of determined moves by disgruntled citizens to regain what they see as dignity, freedom and rights.The best proof of this is the steady expansion in the numbers and capabilities of extremist Salafist-takfiri militant groups such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, the Nusra Front and dozens of other groups that have been repeatedly targeted by military strikes by local governments and the American armed forces. So, military attacks against ISIS and its local allies in Iraq would momentarily pause the current trajectory of the group's expansion, but will not stop it in the long run.The fact that some Iraqis would consider life under the draconian rules of ISIS preferable to the conditions they had endured under previous elected Iraqi governments shows how severe are the grievances of ordinary citizens under the rule of Arab tyrants. Most disgruntled Arab citizens would not join groups such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda, but rather would seek reforms of their mismanaged states through gradual change, or the revolution some of them experienced in the last three years.So the only lasting antidote to the problems we are witnessing in Syria and Iraq, and in less intense forms in Bahrain, Libya, Egypt and Yemen, requires many years to take shape. That antidote is more democratic and inclusive government coupled with growing economies. Even just one of these two imperatives would give citizens the sense of hope that they and their children might enjoy a better future.When citizens suffer both police state-style governments with stagnant economies that mostly favor a small number of families close to the ruling regimes, we end up with situations like the ones in Syria and Iraq. Citizens who have grown frustrated because of their mistreatment by their own governments desperately turn to groups such as ISIS to give them an alternative lifestyle. There can be no greater indictment than that of the sickness, criminality and rot that have defined most Arab governance systems in recent decades.Making the transition from this desperate condition to a more democratic and economically developing society takes a long time. But ordinary Arab citizens who pay the price today - including millions of refugees, such as the half-million who fled the city of Mosul in two days earlier this week - have no practical options but to keep exploring ways of transforming their failing autocratic systems into more coherent and satisfying ones that are based on participation, pluralism and accountability.The rapid expansion of ISIS in Iraq is not a sign of the future, because these extremists have no base of support in the region. They only gain territory by force and in conditions of chaos. In more normal conditions, they have never had any serious support in Arab countries.ISIS is frightening, to be sure, but not because it portends our future; it is frightening because it reminds us of the criminal incompetence of ruling Arab regimes during the past half-century, and as such it clarifies what must be done to bring Arab societies back to some semblance of normal life. This will be a long and hard struggle, but we have no other options."

Freedom Summer, as it was aptly titled, helped change the course of this nation. Because of Mississippi's horrendously low black voter registration rate, this state became symbolic of the larger systemic issue of voter disenfranchisement across the country. Today, 50 years on from that historic summer, we are facing many of the same challenges in a host of states. After so many marched, organized, petitioned, registered voters, and risked their lives and livelihoods -- and some even died -- how do we as a country allow their victories to be stripped away before our very eyes? If there was ever a time to have a renewed Freedom Summer, that time is now, in 2014.In all my years of civil rights work, I never thought I'd see the day that the Voting Rights Act would be effectively gutted and transformed. Last year the Supreme Court did just that when it declared Section 5 of the Act (which requires areas with a history of discrimination to receive federal approval before making voting changes) unconstitutional. States have effectively been able to institute new requirements and make new regulations without federal approval -- and you'd better believe they have been busy doing so. While there has been pushback against this and other measures to block voters from the polls, at least 19 states have enacted harsh voting requirements like new ID laws. Making it more difficult for blacks, the poor, the elderly and other minorities to participate, these laws have caused us to regress as a society and forget about the goals of that Freedom Summer 50 years past. It is up to us to put an end to these draconian measures. We must urge Congress to pass the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014 and restore protections for our right to vote. When heroic Americans like Bob Moses, Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and many others sacrificed so greatly during Freedom Summer, we must ensure that their work lives on. We must conduct similar voter registration drives, especially in the 19 or so states that have instituted harsh new voting laws. If we fail to challenge these injustices today, we will do a disservice to all those who fought and died before us. I often say that we have a lot to celebrate, and we have undoubtedly made tremendous gains, but much work remains. It's time to stop living in denial and look beyond our own individual interests. The fate of our very democracy is at stake.As we mark the half-century since Freedom Summer, we have a tendency to rejoice prematurely. We have gone from people being murdered over voting rights to watching the first black president and attorney general in office. That is an undeniable achievement. But before we pop the cork off champagne bottles and celebrate, we have some unfinished business. In many of the areas that made up the Confederacy some 150 years ago, we now see right-wing Republican legislatures that are attacking everything from voting rights to same-sex marriage and a woman's right to choose. We are witnessing outright resistance against civil rights gains like affirmative action. And in states with new voter ID laws, we're seeing a concerted effort to limit if not suppress the minority vote. It is my firm belief that we ought to acknowledge and appreciate how far we've come, but only as we continue to push for change in the clear areas where we have remaining challenges. Those who struggled and sacrificed during Freedom Summer were often criticized as troublemakers, but they knew that they were fighting on the side of justice. When people raise issues and organize around causes today, they too will be scrutinized as somehow stirring trouble. But when you are aligned with equality and progress, that just becomes part of the journey; it should never deter anyone. As we continue on this road together, we can celebrate our victories, but to act as if we've arrived is premature. The aircraft is not at the gate of true freedom. It hasn't even landed on the tarmac yet."

GDP growth of all but two states was positive last year, although economic growth at the state level varied considerably.While some states experienced truly substantial growth, helping to drive the U.S. economy, others languished, according to a recent release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). In all, 12 state economies grew by less than 1% last year. Maryland’s economy remained flat, the third consecutive year in which the state’s growth rate slowed. And after being among the nation’s fastest growing economies in 2011 and 2012, Alaska’s GDP fell 2.5% last year. Based on figures published by the BEA, these are the states with the lowest real GDP growth rates in 2013.Click here to see the 10 slowest growing state economiesClick here to see the 10 fastest growing state economiesOne factor that impacted growth at both the national and state levels was government spending. According to Cliff Woodruff, an economist at the BEA, “[in] some of the bottom states, government seemed to be one of the sectors that was affecting those states.” This was especially the case in Alaska and Virginia, where low government spending dragged down GDP by at least one quarter of a percentage point. In all, the government sector weighed down growth rates in 39 states.In many of the states with the slowest GDP growth, government output as a percent of GDP was relatively high. In four of these states, the government sector contributed to more than 15% of total output. In Maryland, the government sector accounted for 21% of state GDP in 2013. By contrast, nationwide, the government sector accounted for just 12.5% of output last year.Outside of government spending, however, these states’ economies were often very different. For example, the three slowest growing states — Alaska, Maryland and Virginia — were also among the nation’s wealthiest. Meanwhile, Tennessee and Alabama, which had among the lowest median incomes in the nation, also posted weak growth rates last year.Industries in the private sector that contributed to underwhelming GDP growth figures differed considerably between these states as well. In Alaska, mining accounted for nearly all of the decline in output. According to Woodruff, “Alaska has continued to see a decline in [oil] production on their North Slope.” On the other hand, finance and insurance played a major part in constricting growth in New York. And in Tennessee, durable goods manufacturing and construction both weighed considerably on growth.Slowing GDP growth does not always have an immediate affect on many aspects of the economy. Just three of the slowest growing states had unemployment rates above the U.S. rate for 2013. Additionally, the unemployment rate in a few of these states was well below the national benchmark, including in Virginia, where just 5.5% of the workforce was unemployed last year.However, the housing market lagged alongside GDP growth in the nation’s slowest growing states. Home prices in every slow-growing state grew at a slower pace than the nation’s home price growth of 7.6% in 2013. In seven of these states, housing price rose by less than 4%. In Maine, one of the slowest growing states, home prices rose just 1.8% last year.Based on figures published by the BEA, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 states with the slowest growing economies. The BEA’s state growth figures are measured by real gross domestic product, which accounts for the effects of inflation on growth. GDP figures published by the BEA for 2013 are preliminary and subject to annual revision. Real GDP figures for past years have already been revised. Population figures are from the U.S. Census Bureau and reflect estimated growth between July 1, 2012, and July 1, 2013. We also used eata on median household income, poverty, and food stamp participation from the U.S. Census Bureau. Last year’s unemployment rates are annual averages and from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Home price data are from the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Information from the Energy Information Administration was also utilized.These are America’s slowest growing states.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly featured a slideshow showing the 10 fastest growing state economies.
