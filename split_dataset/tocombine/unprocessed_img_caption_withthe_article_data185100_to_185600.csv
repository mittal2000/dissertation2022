After a highly publicized custody battle, Christie Brinkley and ex-husband Peter Cook reached an out-of-court settlement over the weekend, the New York Post reported Monday. The couple, whose custody dispute landed back in the spotlight in March, settled a day before the they were set to go to trial, the paper reported. Both parties were quick to issue statements about the settlement, with Cook's lawyer stating on behalf of his client, ""The settlement we reached proves Ms. Brinkley's claims were baseless and that a hearing would have only proved to be a further embarrassment for her."" Meanwhile, 58-year-old Brinkley took to her Facebook to address the end of the legal ordeal with Cook, which she called ""an odyssey of frustration"": ""I finally won the right to establish boundaries with provisions such as an intermediary to deal with email bullying, verbal and emotional abuse,"" she wrote. Though the couple finalized their divorce four years ago, Cook appeared on a number of television shows in early March to counter Brinkley's claims that he owed her child support and had sent her ""inflammatory"" emails. During a March 7 interview with ""Nightline,"" the 53-year-old architect, who secretly married longterm girlfriend Suzanne Shaw in February, claimed that Brinkley was trying to ""publicly castrate"" him in order to drum up publicity for herself.
