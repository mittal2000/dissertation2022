While many products may claim to ease congestion, few have been proven effective.There's no one-size-fits-all congestion remedy for everyone, but knowing the five major types of congestion fighters can make finding a winning combination easier.More From Everyday Health: Treating the Common Cold Update: Zinc Nasal Sprays for the Common Cold The Vicks VapoRub DebateOver-the-counter congestion medications can ease congestion quickly if you know what to look for. For those who can't or would rather not treat congestion with any drugs, there are also alternative natural treatments that can offer to help you breathe easier without a trip to the pharmacy.Decongestants The king of over-the-counter congestion medications is a decongestant, which comes in either pill or spray form. They both work by shrinking the swollen blood vessels in the nose and air passages caused by congestion.Treating a stuffy nose with a decongestant nasal spray can offer the fastest relief. The medicine goes straight to the site of congestion without going through your body first, so there are fewer side effects than with oral decongestants.Popular decongestant nasal sprays include oxymetazoline hydrochloride (Afrin) and neo-synephrine.“The major drawback of nasal sprays is that they can be used only for a short time because of the rebound effect,” says Janet Engle, PharmD, professor and head of the department of pharmacy practice at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Pharmacy.The rebound effect means the drug loses its effectiveness with prolonged use, and you have to take it more often to get the same degree of congestion relief. This can also lead to dependency on the drug.""Afrin is very good at opening up the nasal passages,” says Michael Seidman, M.D., professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at Wayne State University in West Bloomfield, Mich., and medical director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. ""But don't use it for more than two to three days, or else the nose becomes addicted to it.""For congestion that lasts longer than a few days, experts say oral decongestants are a better option. A 2012 survey of U.S. pharmacists showed the most recommended pill to ease congestion was pseudophedrine (Sudafed).""Sudafed is still the gold standard,” says Engle, but she adds that, in recent years, Sudafed and all other medications containing the active ingredient pseudophedrine are now behind the counter in order to crack down on illegal methamphetamine production.As a result, Engle says people often confuse the decongestant phenylephrine, which can still be found on drugstore shelves, with pseudophedrine. “But it's less predictable than Sudafed,” says Engle. “It's worth the extra effort to ask for Sudafed from behind the counter.”Decongestants aren't for everyone though. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend over-the-counter congestion medications or other cold medicines for children under the age of 4. If you're pregnant, you should also consult your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medication.Side effects of decongestants include increased heart rate, so they should be avoided if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, an irregular heartbeat, glaucoma, or difficulty urinating.Dietary Supplements If you catch the first signs of congestion or other symptoms of a cold fast enough, dietary supplements like zinc may help. Zinc supplements work by binding with zinc receptors found on common cold and flu viruses to potentially reduce the amount of the virus circulating in the body.“Zinc surrounds the virus, so you have to suck on a lozenge for it to come in contact with the virus in the mouth and throat,” says Engle. “But you must take it within the first 24 hours after symptoms start.”Engle says zinc may help by shortening the duration of congestion symptoms, but it does not have decongestant effects.Other dietary supplements like echinacea, vitamin C and probiotics are often touted as cold and congestion remedies, but Dr. Seidman says they are better suited to boost overall immune function than fighting a stuffy nose.“If you are full blown into a cold, it is probably not going to help,” says Seidman. “It's best to take them at the onset of symptoms or just before.”Just Add Water Another remedy for a stuffy nose may already be in your home: Salt water.Whether salt water gets to your nose via neti pot, nasal irrigation, or a saline mist, it eases congestion by moistening and cleaning out the nasal passages.“The nose loves salt water,” says Seidman. “A home remedy I tell people is to mix 1 quart of water, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and run it up your nose.”Neti pots have become trendy recently as a way to rinse nasal passages, but they have been around for thousands of years. Nasal irrigation systems are also popular, but research is mixed on their effectiveness.The FDA has concerns about the risk of infection associated with the use of neti pots and other nasal rinsing devices. Although they are generally safe, the FDA says the use of tap water contaminated with a rare amoeba in neti pots has been linked to two deaths. The FDA recommends using purchased distilled or sterile water, boiled and cooled tap water, or water passed through one of its recommended filters in any of these devices to reduce the risk of infection.Engle says saline nasal sprays are a convenient option to moisten and help drain a stuffy nose because the contents are premixed and sterile, which reduces the potential for infection if used properly.For people squeamish about rinsing out their nose, experts say simply moistening the air around you can help.“A humidifier is a good thing for young children and people who don't want to use drugs,"" says Engle. Cool mist humidifiers are recommended in children's bedrooms to reduce the risk of burns from warm mist versions.Right on the Nose Getting relief right to your nose may be another option to ease congestion. Adhesive nasal strips, like Breathe Right, for instance, work by widening the nostrils to help people breathe easier.Engle says they aren't generally useful in treating colds, but they can be helpful for women experiencing pregnancy-related congestion.Using aromatherapy to breathe in the scent of eucalyptus or menthol-based rubs like VapoRub may also provide some relief.Feed a Cold The old adage “Feed a cold, starve a fever,” may have some scientific proof to back it up -- to a point. “There is evidence that mom was right with chicken soup for a cold,” says Seidman.For example, a long-standing study published in the journal Chest suggests chicken soup may help reduce the inflammation associated with congestion and the common cold. Plus, the steam from a hot bowl of soup may open stuffy noses. Drinking other hot fluids, like tea and broth, can also help thin the mucus in the nose and let it drain.When to See Your Doctor Experts say you should think twice before calling your doctor to ask for antibiotics to ease your congestion.Most stuffy noses are caused by infection with a virus, which makes antibiotics powerless to treat them. Antibiotics are only effective in treating infections caused by bacteria.“Everyone wants an antibiotic for congestion, but they don't necessarily need one,” says Seidman. “It's silly to take antibiotics because it's not going to help the cold or flu.”But there are warning signs that your congestion may be a sign of something more serious. See a doctor if you experience congestion symptoms that last more than 7 to 10 days, are accompanied by a fever of more than 101.5 degrees or a fever that won't go down, or that worsen over time.5 Top Congestion Fighters originally appeared on Everyday Health"
1,FOOD & DRINK,There Are HOW MANY Kinds of Milk for Sale?,"Epicurious, Contributor

There seem to be more choices now than ever, and that's a good thing, although it can be a bit confusing. Most conventional milk is from Holstein cows but milk from other breeds are also available as well as many non-dairy sources. Here are some of the milk varieties I've found recently and my take on each. Organic milk: What makes milk organic? Organic milk comes from cows fed organic feed and not given synthetic growth hormones or antibiotics. It's possible that organic milk has higher concentrations of some omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, but that's not the only reason to buy it. Organic dairy cows are required to spend time on organic pastures and organic practices are better for the environment too.SEE MORE: Your New Favorite Chicken RecipeNon-homogenized milk: There has been a lot of controversy about homogenization. While some say homogenization is not good for human consumption, there is not much in the way of science to back that up. According to Berkeley Wellness homogenized milk may actually be easier to digest and certainly has longer shelf life. That said, there is nothing wrong with drinking non-homogenized milk and many people enjoy the separate layer of cream that rises to the surface. It all comes down to personal preference. Grass milk (a registered trademark): Grass milk sounds like milk made from grass, but it's not. It's the name for milk that's from cows that graze on pasture all year round. Research show it is richer in omega-3 fats, vitamin E, beta-carotene, calcium and conjugated linoleic acid. Recently I got a chance to visit the Regli family Organic Valley dairy farm one of the producers of grass milk in Humboldt county. Some grass milk comes from Holsteins but the Regli's raise beautiful Jersey cows. Organic Valley does not homogenize their grass milk and this month it is being launched nationwide. Guernsey milk: Guernsey cows produce a richer, sweeter flavored milk with more nutrients than most dairy cows. Guernsey milk has 12% more protein, 30% more cream, 33% more vitamin D, 25% more vitamin A and 15% more calcium than average Holstein milk. It's hard to know which milk cows dairies are using, but sometimes you will see it on the label. Guernsey cows were mostly phased out in favor of Holsteins. Jersey milk: Locally there is another producer of Jersey milk where I live, St. Benoît. The milk is very rich. Jersey milk contains 18% more protein, 20% more calcium and 25% more butterfat than average milk. Like grass milk it is non-homogenized.Raw milk: Even more controversial than homogenization is raw milk. It is not even available for purchase in some states. Raw milk is not pasteurized. Some people maintain that pasteurization destroys beneficial bacteria, proteins, and enzymes that aid digestion. However raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can cause harm including listeria. You can read what the FDA says about raw milk and decide for yourself.  SEE MORE: Indulgent, Delicious BreakfastsLactose free milk: Have you ever wondered how milk can be lactose free? Lactose free milk simply contains lactase, a natural enzyme that helps break down lactose. Since many people are lactose intollerant, this enables them to enjoy dairy products with ease. Goat's milk : Over half of the world's milk consumption is goat's milk. The levels of Alpha s1 Casein in goat's milk are about 89% less than cow's milk which means it's less allergenic. It's naturally homogenized, so the cream does not separate and it has less lactose than cow's milk. More similar to human milk, it's also easier for us to digest. Soy milk : Soy milk is a controversial form or milk as well. It has less protein than dairy milk and unlike fermented soy products like miso and tofu, it contains ""antinutrtients"" that actually decrease assimilation of calcium, magnesium, copper, iron and zinc. Drinking it interferes with vitamin absorption as well. There are also concerns about how soy is grown and the chemicals used on it that do damage to the environment. Rice milk: Rice milk has no saturated fat or cholesterol, but barely any protein. Some rice milk is shelf stable until the package is opened. It's mild flavored and easy to digest. Almond milk: Although almond milk has calcium, vitamin D, and the antioxidant vitamin E it does not have very much protein. Unsweetened almond milk is naturally low in calories. I've heard of hemp milk and oat milk, but I've never seen either in my local grocery store. What kind of milk do you drink and why?See more from Epicurious:  Quick and Easy Dinners Taste Test: 3 Addictive Peanut Butters   The Secret to Stress-Free Weight Loss  Back-to-School Lunch Ideas for Kids"
2,TRAVEL,9 Stunning Landscapes of Vietnam,"Lina Eroh, Contributor

From white sand beaches and turquoise water to black rock forests and mountains that hug the clouds, here are some of the most amazing landscapes we came across. With a coastline of over 2025 miles, it's no surprise that Vietnam has a ton of beautiful beaches. And when the rest stop during your bus trip looks like this, you don't have much to complain about.The biggest beach destination in Vietnam is likely the town of Nha Trang, which boasts all day boat tours and all night parties. If you're missing Miami while in SE Asia, this is the closest we found. The beach in the main town is pretty nice, but the offshore islands are where you want to head if you're looking to snorkel or dive. With perfect visibility, good quality coral, and thousands of multicolored fish flitting about, having a great day is easy, especially since the all day island-hopping tour costs approximately $6.But Vietnam's coastline isn't all sparkling white sand and clear blue water. Our favorite coastal landscape was the sand dunes around Mui Ne, which come in both red and white varieties. Whether you jump, run, or slide, it's hard not to let the beauty of the dunes overwhelm you. Stretching for what seems like miles, the dunes are something you'd expect to find in Africa. Instead, they're here, only a few minutes away from one of the best places in the world to learn to kitesurf.Most countries with a coastline have beaches, but they don't all have rice terraces, especially ones that look like this.The terraces in Sapa were carved over two thousand years ago by hand and are still inhabited primarily by the Black Hmong tribespeople. These mountain dwellers live off the land, planting and harvesting rice year in and year out in order to sustain their families.Tourists can explore the terraces by taking a multiday trekking tour with a Hmong guide. You'll stay in homestays run by the local villagers, get knee deep in mud, and appreciate rice way more than you ever have.Further north and to the east of Sapa lies the unexplored Vietnam of the Ha Giang province. You need a permit to stay the night and a camera with lots of battery power to take all of the photos of the immense scenery that surrounds you as you drive by on your motorbike. The most beautiful part of the road, and arguably one of the most beautiful drives in the world, is the leg between Dong Van and Meo Vac. Here the road darts in and out of rock crevices and up and down mountains and valleys.Children in traditional tribal outfits scream ""hello"" from above and below as they carry double their weight of sticks in bamboo baskets. Men wear high-necked black tunics and matching berets and women wrap electric pink scarves over their hair, giving the game of ""I Spot"" a whole new meaning.Perhaps the most quintessential scene of Vietnam is the floating limestone karst formations of Halong Bay. Best seen on a multi-day boat tour, these rocks rise out of the still water and emerge through the mist forming, if you look hard enough, the shape of a descending dragon. At least that's what the locals tell you, and how Halong Bay gets its name. Kayaking through some of these formations is a must, as is sitting back on your boat tour and letting the scenery and mist envelop you.Did you enjoy these photos and stories?

The film is based on a novel by Yasmina Khadra and the many of the flashbacks are more novelistic than cinematic. They're not merely visuals amplifying a story, but independent vignettes, part and parcel of the back and forth between appearance and reality that constitutes the theme. Nothing is what it appears to be in the film which deals with a Palestinian born Israeli doctor (Ali Suliman) who discovers that his wife is a terrorist. Throughout the first part of the movie Amin, the doctor, is slowly and painfully disabused of his preconceptions about Siham (Reymond Amsalem), his beautiful wife. These early scenes, which are suspenseful could be compared to Vertigo in which Scottie (James Stewart) seeks to find an apparition, a woman who it turns out never existed. Then just as the protagonist and by proxy the viewer are ready to accept one truth, another asserts itself. Siham is, despite everything she has done to herself and others, what she always was, a devoted and loving wife. Does the film owe its provenance to Hitchcock or to filmmakers like Pontecorvo who used a cinema verite style to convey a political message? In the case of The Attack, the esthetic and the political aren't mutually exclusive. The Attack uses the unraveling of the suspense genre in the service of its message--which is one of moral ambiguity. There's no right or wrong. Both Amin and Siham are deluded into thinking that political reality does or does not define them. Their tragedy--and it's something they both learn too late to do anything about--is that the personal and the political are inextricably intertwined."
