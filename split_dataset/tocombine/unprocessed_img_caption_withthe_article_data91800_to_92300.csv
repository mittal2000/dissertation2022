Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition of several Arab countries which since March 26 has carried out air strikes against the Shiite Huthis rebels, who overran the capital Sanaa in September and have expanded to other parts of Yemen. AFP PHOTO / FAYEZ NURELDINE (Photo credit should read FAYEZ NURELDINE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1498a2400006800382b0f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Mohamed MukashafADEN, April 14 (Reuters) - Iran proposed a peace plan for Yemen on Tuesday and called for an end to Saudi-led air strikes against Houthi rebels allied to Tehran, but the move was likely to draw a cool response from Riyadh.On the battlefront, militiamen loyal to deposed President President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi said they had pushed back Houthi fighters at several points in southern Yemen, including districts of the port city of Aden, the focal point of a conflict that entered its most dangerous phase three weeks ago.After prolonged street fighting, Houthi fighters withdrew from Aden's Khor Maksar district, where the international airport and foreign missions are located.The pull-out deprives the Houthis of a bridge to downtown areas where they face heavy resistance from local fighters.Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies have been bombing the Houthis since March 25 to drive them from Aden, the most important city still loyal to Hadi.The Houthis, northern-based Shi'ite Moslims, seized control of Yemen's capital Sanaa in September, confining Hadi to the presidential residence. He fled to Aden in February then escaped to Riyadh last month as Houthi forces closed in on the city.The conflict, though rooted in local rivalries, has become a proxy battlefield for regional powers Sunni-ruled Saudi and mainly Shi'ite Iran. Saudi Arabia and other powers accuse Iran of arming the Houthis and interfering in Yemeni affairs. Tehran denies giving military support to the Houthis.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, speaking in Madrid on Tuesday, put forward a peace proposal involving a ceasefire, humanitarian assistance, a dialog between Yemeni factions, and a broad-based government.""This issue should be resolved by the Yemenis. Iran and Saudi Arabia need to talk but we cannot talk to determine the future of Yemen,"" he told a news conference.Zarif also said the air strikes ""are simply not the answer. All operations should end on land and from the air.""On Monday, Zarif had called for a new government in Yemen and offered to assist in a political transition.The offer was unlikely to please Riyadh, which says it is protecting Hadi and his government-in-exile from the Houthis.But as the world' largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia is also unhappy at the prospect of protracted upheaval in its southern neighbor.Hadi and his Saudi backers also face fierce opposition from soldiers loyal to former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has teamed up with his old foes the Houthis.Al Qaeda, which has staged suicide bombings against the Houthis, also poses a threat to Yemen's stability. The United States has poured aid and personnel into the country in recent years as part of its war on Islamist militants, but its military teams evacuated last month.Nearby shipping lanes and the narrow Bab el-Mandeb passage, through which nearly 4 million barrels of oil are shipped daily to Europe, the United States and Asia, could also be at risk from the fighting. SOUTHERN FIGHTSSouthern militia sources said they wrested control of an army base loyal to the Houthis after heavy fighting on Monday night near the Balhaf liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, in southern Shabwa province on the Arabian Sea.Yemen LNG, the company managing the facility, said it had halted production due to insecurity and was evacuating staff. Militia sources said they had moved into the port to secure it from looting.Militiamen said their fighters had killed around 40 Houthis and allied soldiers in the southern province of Dhalea over the past day, although this could not be independently confirmed.In the southern town of Houta in Lahej province, fighters said they attacked a Houthi tank with rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns on Monday night, killing about 15 rebels.Weeks of street battles have left parts of once thriving Aden in ruins and led to shortages of water, food and electricity. But armed townspeople say they have laid siege to pockets of Houthi and army fighters loyal to Saleh, forcing them to surrender in the dozens after running out of supplies.Mosque loudspeakers blared appeals for fighters to surrender.""We won't rest until we've ejected them from all our areas and neighborhoods,"" one fighter in Khor Maksar told Reuters.A cargo plane chartered by Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) landed in Sanaa on Monday with 15 tons of medical supplies.The MSF head of mission in Aden, Marie-Elisabeth Ingres, said the supplies should allow the organization to help out other parts of the country but supply routes needed to be kept open and fighting was hampering its work.It is trying to establish a supply route by sea from Djibouti directly to Aden, she said in a statement.The U.N. Security Council is due to vote on Tuesday on a resolution to blacklist Saleh's son Ahmed, the former head of Yemen's Republican Guard, and a Houthi leader and effectively impose an arms embargo on the rebels, diplomats said.(Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Angus MacSwan)"

Argentina's wine producing regions are situated within three distinct environments: the rugged red landscape of the north, the arid central valleys fed by rivers that flow down from the Andes, and lowland Patagonia.  NORTH: Salta and the Calchaqui ValleysTHE REGION'S WINE The country's highest altitude vineyards lie within the Salta Province's Calchaqui Valleys at elevations of between 3,280 and 9,800 feet above sea level. The town of Cafayate is at the heart of this wine region, where lush green vineyards contrast starkly with the red mountains that encircle them. Due to the high altitude, temperatures are low at night with great exposure to the sun throughout each day. With a dry climate too, these conditions cause the grapes to mature slowly, giving the wine an exceptionally intense flavour, while the grapes' thicker skins also result in a great intensity of tannin, transforming the wine's colour and mouthfeel. In this climate, robust wines like Malbec, Tannat, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Torrontes do especially well, of which Torrontes is said to be the region's greatest success.WINERY TOURS Explore Cafayate, which lies at over 5,500 feet above sea level, by hiking and riding on horseback through the surrounding landscape and by taking a tour of the boutique wineries. The hotel Grace Cafayate is set amidst the 1,360-acre La Estancia de Cafayate wine estate, so stays there encompass tours of the estate's vineyards with tastings of their own Torrontés, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. Vinas de Cafayate Wine Resort is another spot to head to for the chance to stay amongst picture-postcard vineyards; The wine resort arranges tours of the most prestigious wine producers in the region and hosts wine tastings in their own wine cellar. One of Argentina's oldest wineries is Bodega Colomé, which was founded in 1831 and located in the upper Calchaqui Valleys. In addition to tours of the winery, the bodega has a museum that's dedicated to installations by the artist James Turrell.Image by Grace CafayateCENTRAL: The Cuyo RegionTHE REGION'S WINE The central-west region of Cuyo encompasses Argentina's most well known wine regions: Mendoza and San Juan with La Rioja nearby. From Mendoza's Uco Valley to Famatina in La Rioja, these viticultural areas lie in the foothills of the Andes with a desert-like climate alongside rivers that flow down from the mountains; An environment that produces an exceptionally high yield of high quality of grapes for winemaking. Malbec garners most of the attention in Mendoza, which is produced alongside Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Bonarda and Syrah, with Torrontes produced in La Rioja too.WINERY TOURS Stay at the stylish Vines Resort & Spa in the Uco Valley to visit the Vines' own biodynamic Winemaker's Village, or stay at the boutique family-owned winery Montequieto for a tour that includes tastings of their award winning wines. Take part in a private wine blending experience with Argentina's most awarded winemaker Alejandro Vigil at the pioneering winery Bodega Catena Zapata, or join a sparkling wine masterclass at Bodega Cruzat. Finca Dinamia is Argentina's original biodynamic winery, and the winemaker that started it all, Alejandro Bianchi, now gives visitors an insight into this unique production process and the wines it produces. Bodegas Salentein in the Uco Valley offers tours and tastings of the winery, and houses collections of contemporary Argentine and classic Dutch art works for visitors to peruse. These exceptional wineries can be incorporated into a wine tour of Mendoza and beyond, with the unrivalled expertise of a local guide.THE FESTIVAL Since 1936 the winemakers of this region have gathered together in Mendoza City for the Grape Harvest Festival, giving the community and visitors the chance to celebrate with them. Each March around 2,000 people arrive for the event's parades, performances, wine tasting and fireworks.Alejandro Bianchi of Finca DinamiaSOUTH: Lowland PatagoniaTHE REGION'S WINE Argentina's southernmost wine producing region is an area that extends over 300 kilometres of Patagonia, incorporating Neuquen and the valley of Rio Negro. Lower in altitude than the other wine regions, this land lies at around 1,000 feet above sea level but is still characterised by desert-like landscape with rivers that flow down from the Andes. Patagonia's colder climate results in slowly-ripening grapes with high sugar, acidity and tannin, producing intensely flavoured wines of both red and sparkling varieties. Pinot Noir reigns above all other varieties here, but Malbec, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Riesling are also suited to the climate. WINERY TOURS Bodega del Fin del Mundo is credited with starting the wine industry in Neuquen back in 1999. Here, you can take tours of the vineyards and taste your way around the winery. Also hosting wine tasting tours is Familia Schroeder, another of Neuquen's leading wineries. In the more established wine region of Rio Negro, the wine estate Bodega Humberto Canale - founded by an engineer of the same name in 1909 - gives tours of its vineyards, colonial-style winery and on-site museum."

Rand Paul, R-Ky., speaks to students during a discussion on criminal justice reform at Bowie State University, in Bowie, Md., Friday, March 13, 2015. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f2762100004202c96dfb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rand Paul announced his candidacy for the presidency last week under the slogan ""Defeat the Washington Machine, Unleash the American Dream."" Yet he seems to be ready to give the biggest Washington machine of all -- the Pentagon -- a free pass. As Nick Gillespie, the editor-in-chief of Reason magazine, noted in a recent piece in Newsweek, Paul's current stance contrasts sharply with the position he took in 2011, when he proposed a budget that would reduce Pentagon spending, lower troop numbers, and close significant numbers of military bases. But most importantly, notes Gillespie, Paul ""started a long-overdue conversation about what the U.S. military should look like and act like in a post-Cold War world.""  This year, Paul made an about-face when he proposed a $190-billion increase in Pentagon spending over the next two years, a jump of about 16 percent. In an effort to maintain his reputation as a fiscal conservative, Paul called for offsetting his proposed Pentagon increase with cuts in other areas of the budget. But the goal of his proposal was clear: to shed the label of being soft on defense that his Republican rivals for the presidency have attempted to pin on him. Paul's change of course has already caused him considerable grief in the media, beginning with an interview with the NBC Today Show's Savannah Guthrie. When Guthrie asked about his shifting positions on Iran, foreign aid, and Pentagon spending, he was decidedly unpresidential, accusing her of editorializing and then talking over her. It was a bad start to his campaign, to put it mildly.  When he did get around to answering Guthrie's questions, Paul split the difference on Iran, saying that ""negotiation is better than war"" and that ""I'm one of the few people in my party who has not been beating the drums for war."" But he also signed the letter to Iran organized by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), which attempted to undermine President Obama's legitimacy in the midst of the negotiations over Tehran's nuclear program.  Paul also said he wouldn't immediately end aid to Israel -- another point of contention with his Republican rivals -- but indicated that it needed to happen over time.  He never answered the question on Pentagon spending. The old Rand Paul -- the one who criticized the president's drone policy, called for Pentagon spending reductions, and was less equivocal in his support for negotiations with Iran -- was a truly distinctive voice in the Republican field. These positions spoke to the concerns of libertarians and could also play well with other small-government conservatives, independents, and even some Democrats concerned about the hawkish stances of Hillary Clinton.  Campaigning as a pale reflection of the hawks who have dominated the discussion on the Republican side is unlikely to serve Paul well. His proposed Pentagon spending increase mirrors one made previously by Marco Rubio (R-Florida) and brings him into line with the rest of the Republican field. But as Nick Gillespie has noted, ""To the extent he sounds more like every conservative Republican, he sounds less interesting to libertarians. I don't see what he picks up by being a version of Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio.""  In addition to returning to his prior, more restrained approach to national security policy, Paul would be well served if he were to emphasize waste and bureaucracy at the Pentagon. The Department of Defense is the only federal agency that can't pass an audit. That means it doesn't know for sure how many contractors it has, where its spare parts are located, or how much it is being overcharged for basic supplies. And its payroll system is so antiquated that it frequently underpays veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  On the issue of bureaucracy, the Pentagon now has over 1 million civilian employees and an estimated 700,000 private contractors. (It does not have a precise number because of its audit problem.) That's roughly one and a half times as many contractors and bureaucrats as there are personnel in the active-duty military. Tens of billions of dollars could be saved by cutting back by 10 to 15 percent in these areas. Rand Paul can do better than simply mimicking the hawks in his party. Taking a stand for fiscal discipline would resonate with an important element in the Republican base, as well as many others who are concerned about how their tax dollars are being spent. And it would underscore the fact that the Pentagon already has more than enough money.William D. Hartung is the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy."

They came from U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command, from France and Norway, from Denmark, Germany, and Canada: 13 nations in all. They came to plan a years-long “Special Operations-centric” military campaign supported by conventional forces, a multinational undertaking that -- if carried out -- might cost hundreds of millions, maybe billions, of dollars and who knows how many lives.Ask the men involved and they’ll talk about being mindful of “sensitivities” and “cultural differences,” about the importance of “collaboration and coordination,” about the value of a variety of viewpoints, about “perspectives” and “partnerships.” Nonetheless, behind closed doors and unbeknownst to most of the people in their own countries, let alone the countries fixed in their sights, a coterie of Western special ops planners were sketching out a possible multinational military future for a troubled region of Africa.From January 13th to 15th, representatives from the U.S. and 12 partner nations gathered at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa for an exercise dubbed Silent Quest 15-1. The fictional scenario on which they were to play out their war game had a ripped-from-the-headlines quality to it. It was an amalgam of two perfectly real and ongoing foreign policy and counterterrorism disasters of the post-9/11 era: the growth of Boko Haram in Nigeria and the emergence of the Islamic State, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or ISIL. The war game centered on the imagined rise of a group dubbed the “Islamic State of Africa” and the spread of its proto-caliphate over parts of Nigeria, Niger, and Cameroon -- countries terrorized by the real Boko Haram, which did recently pledge its allegiance to the Islamic State.Silent Quest 15-1 was just the latest in a series of similarly named exercises -- the first took place in March 2013 -- designed to help plot out the special ops interventions of the next decade. This war game was no paintball-style walk in the woods. There were no mock firefights, no dress rehearsals. It wasn’t the flag football equivalent of battle. Instead, it was a tabletop exercise building on something all too real: the ever-expanding panoply of U.S. and allied military activities across ever-larger parts of Africa. Speaking of that continent, Matt Pascual, a participant in Silent Quest and the Africa desk officer for SOCOM’s Euro-Africa Support Group, noted that the U.S. and its allies were already dealing with “myriad issues” in the region and, perhaps most importantly, that many of the participating countries “are already there.” The country “already there” the most is, of course, Pascual’s own: the United States. In recent years, the U.S. has been involved in a variety of multinational interventions in Africa, including one in Libya that involved both a secret war and a conventional campaign of missiles and air strikes, assistance to French forces in the Central African Republic and Mali, and the training and funding of African proxies to do battle against militant groups like Boko Haram as well as Somalia’s al-Shabab and Mali’s Ansar al-Dine. In 2014, the U.S. carried out 674 military activities across Africa, nearly two missions per day, an almost 300 percent jump in the number of annual operations, exercises, and military-to-military training activities since U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) was established in 2008. Despite this massive increase in missions and a similar swelling of bases, personnel, and funding, the picture painted last month before the Senate Armed Services Committee by AFRICOM chief General David Rodriguez was startlingly bleak. For all the American efforts across Africa, Rodriguez offered a vision of a continent in crisis, imperiled from East to West by militant groups that have developed, grown in strength, or increased their deadly reach in the face of U.S. counterterrorism efforts. “Transregional terrorists and criminal networks continue to adapt and expand aggressively,” Rodriguez told committee members. “Al-Shabab has broadened its operations to conduct, or attempt to conduct, asymmetric attacks against Uganda, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and especially Kenya. Libya-based threats are growing rapidly, including an expanding ISIL presence... Boko Haram threatens the ability of the Nigerian government to provide security and basic services in large portions of the northeast.” Despite the grim outcomes since the American military began “pivoting” to Africa after 9/11, the U.S. recently signed an agreement designed to keep its troops based on the continent until almost midcentury.Mission Creep For years, the U.S. military has publicly insisted that its efforts in Africa are negligible, intentionally leaving the American people, not to mention most Africans, in the dark about the true size, scale, and scope of its operations there. AFRICOM public affairs personnel and commanders have repeatedly claimed no more than a “light footprint” on the continent. They shrink from talk of camps and outposts, claiming to have just one base anywhere in Africa: Camp Lemonnier in the tiny nation of Djibouti. They don’t like to talk about military operations. They offer detailed information about only a tiny fraction of their training exercises. They refuse to disclose the locations where personnel have been stationed or even counts of the countries involved.During an interview, an AFRICOM spokesman once expressed his worry to me that even tabulating how many deployments the command has in Africa would offer a “skewed image” of U.S. efforts. Behind closed doors, however, AFRICOM’s officers speak quite a different language. They have repeatedly asserted that the continent is an American “battlefield” and that -- make no bones about it -- they are already embroiled in an actual “war.”According to recently released figures from U.S. Africa Command, the scope of that “war” grew dramatically in 2014. In its “posture statement,” AFRICOM reports that it conducted 68 operations last year, up from 55 the year before. These included operations Juniper Micron and Echo Casemate, missions focused on aiding French and African interventions in Mali and the Central African Republic; Observant Compass, an effort to degrade or destroy what’s left of Joseph Kony’s murderous Lord’s Resistance Army in central Africa; and United Assistance, the deployment of military personnel to combat the Ebola crisis in West Africa.The number of major joint field exercises U.S. personnel engaged in with African military partners inched up from 10 in 2013 to 11 last year. These included African Lion in Morocco, Western Accord in Senegal, Central Accord in Cameroon, and Southern Accord in Malawi, all of which had a field training component and served as capstone events for the prior year’s military-to-military instruction missions. AFRICOM also conducted maritime security exercises including Obangame Express in the Gulf of Guinea, Saharan Express in the waters off Senegal, and three weeks of maritime security training scenarios as part of Phoenix Express 2014, with sailors from numerous countries including Algeria, Italy, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey.The number of security cooperation activities skyrocketed from 481 in 2013 to 595 last year. Such efforts included military training under a “state partnership program” that teams African military forces with U.S. National Guard units and the State Department-funded Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance, or ACOTA, program through which U.S. military advisers and mentors provide equipment and instruction to African troops.In 2013, the combined total of all U.S. activities on the continent reached 546, an average of more than one mission per day. Last year, that number leapt to 674. In other words, U.S. troops were carrying out almost two operations, exercises, or activities -- from drone strikes to counterinsurgency instruction, intelligence gathering to marksmanship training -- somewhere in Africa every day. This represents an enormous increase from the 172 “missions, activities, programs, and exercises” that AFRICOM inherited from other geographic commands when it began operations in 2008. Transnational Terror Groups: Something From Nothing In 2000, a report prepared under the auspices of the U.S. Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute examined the “African security environment.” While it touched on “internal separatist or rebel movements” in “weak states,” as well as non-state actors like militias and “warlord armies,” there was conspicuously no mention of Islamic extremism or major transnational terrorist threats. Prior to 2001, in fact, the United States did not recognize any terrorist organizations in sub-Saharan Africa and a senior Pentagon official noted that the most feared Islamic militants on the continent had “not engaged in acts of terrorism outside Somalia.” In the wake of 9/11, even before AFRICOM was created, the U.S. began ramping up operations across the continent in an effort to bolster the counterterror capabilities of allies and insulate Africa from transnational terror groups, namely globe-trotting Islamic extremists. The continent, in other words, was seen as something of a clean slate for experiments in terror prevention. Billions of dollars have been pumped into Africa to build bases, arm allies, gather intelligence, fight proxy wars, assassinate militants, and conduct perhaps thousands of military missions -- and none of it has had its intended effect. Last year, for example, Somali militants “either planned or executed increasingly complex and lethal attacks in Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Djibouti, and Ethiopia,” according to AFRICOM. Earlier this month, those same al-Shabab militants upped the ante by slaughtering 142 students at a college in Kenya. And al-Shabab’s deadly growth and spread has hardly been the exception to the rule in Africa. In recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, AFRICOM commander Rodriguez rattled off the names of numerous Islamic terror groups that have sprung up in the intervening years, destabilizing the very countries the U.S. had sought to strengthen. While the posture statement he presented put the best gloss possible on Washington’s military efforts in Africa, even a cursory reading of it -- and under the circumstances, it’s worth quoting at length -- paints a bleak picture of what that “pivot” to Africa has actually meant on the ground. Sections pulled from various parts of the document speak volumes:“The network of al-Qaeda and its affiliates and adherents continues to exploit Africa’s under-governed regions and porous borders to train and conduct attacks. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is expanding its presence in North Africa. Terrorists with allegiances to multiple groups are expanding their collaboration in recruitment, financing, training, and operations, both within Africa and trans-regionally. Violent extremist organizations are utilizing increasingly sophisticated improvised explosive devices, and casualties from these weapons in Africa increased by approximately 40 percent in 2014...“In North and West Africa, Libyan and Nigerian insecurity increasingly threaten U.S. interests. In spite of multinational security efforts, terrorist and criminal networks are gaining strength and interoperability. Al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, Ansar al-Sharia, al-Murabitun, Boko Haram, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and other violent extremist organizations are exploiting weak governance, corrupt leadership, and porous borders across the Sahel and Maghreb to train and move fighters and distribute resources... “Libya-based threats to U.S. interests are growing… Libyan governance, security, and economic stability deteriorated significantly in the past year… Today, armed groups control large areas of territory in Libya and operate with impunity. Libya appears to be emerging as a safe haven where terrorists, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-affiliated groups, can train and rebuild with impunity. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is increasingly active in Libya, including in Derna, Benghazi, Tripoli, and Sebha...“The spillover effects of instability in Libya and northern Mali increase risks to U.S. interests in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, including the success of Tunisia’s democratic transition...“The security situation in Nigeria also declined in the past year. Boko Haram threatens the functioning of a government that is challenged to maintain its people’s trust and to provide security and other basic services… Boko Haram has launched attacks across Nigeria’s borders into Cameroon, Chad, and Niger...“...both the Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of the Congo are at risk of further destabilization by insurgent groups, and simmering ethnic tensions in the Great Lakes region have the potential to boil over violently in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.”All this, mind you, is AFRICOM’s own assessment of the situation on the continent on which it has focused its efforts for the better part of a decade as U.S. missions there soared. In this context, it’s worth reemphasizing that, before the U.S. ramped up those efforts, Africa was -- by Washington’s own estimation -- relatively free of transnational Islamic terror groups.Tipping the Scales in AfricaDespite Boko Haram’s pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State and scare headlines lamenting their merger or conflating those or other brutal terror outfits operating under similar monikers, there is currently no real Islamic State of Africa. But the war game carried out at MacDill Air Force Base in January against that fictional group is far from fantasy, representing as it does the next logical step in a series of operations that have been gaining steam since AFRICOM’s birth. And buried in the command’s 2015 Posture Statement is actual news that signals a continuation of this trajectory into the 2040s.In May 2014, the U.S. reached an agreement -- it’s called an “implementing arrangement” -- with the government of Djibouti “that secures [its] presence” in that country “through 2044.” In addition, AFRICOM officers are now talking about the possibility of building a string of surveillance outposts along the northern tier of the continent. And don’t forget how, over the past few years, U.S. staging areas, mini-bases, and airfields have popped up in the contiguous nations of Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and -- skipping Chad (where AFRICOM recently built temporary facilities for a special ops exercise) -- the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia. All of this suggests that the U.S. military is digging in for the long haul in Africa. Silent Quest 15-1 was designed as a model to demonstrate just how Washington will conduct “Special Operations-centric” coalition warfare in Africa. It was, in fact, designed to align, wrote Gunnery Sergeant Reina Barnett in SOCOM’s trade publication Tip of the Spear, with the “2020 planning guidance of Army Maj. Gen. James Linder, commander of Special Operations Command Africa.” And the agreement with Djibouti demonstrates that the U.S. military is now beginning to plan for almost a quarter-century beyond that. But, if the last six years -- marked by a 300 percent increase in U.S. missions as well as the spread of terror groups and terrorism in Africa -- are any indicator, the results are likely to be anything but pleasing to Washington. AFRICOM commander David Rodriguez continues to put the best face on U.S. efforts in Africa, citing “progress in several areas through close cooperation with our allies and partners.” His command’s assessment of the situation, however, is remarkably bleak. “Where our national interests compel us to tip the scales and enhance collective security gains, we may have to do more -- either by enabling our allies and partners, or acting unilaterally,” reads the posture statement Rodriguez delivered to that Senate committee. After more than a decade of increasing efforts, however, there’s little evidence that AFRICOM has the slightest idea how to tip the scales in its own favor in Africa.Nick Turse is the managing editor of TomDispatch.com and a fellow at the Nation Institute.

The food stamps are supposed to supplement your budget, not be all that you eat. Here is the reality, with rent and other expenses, if you are living on minimum wage, food stamps may be all you have to eat. You can argue that it is supposed to be a supplement until we are blue in the face, but when there is no other money available, that $29 per week (on average) is all you have to eat on. No one, not even Gwyneth Paltrow can understand the hunger and desperation felt by those using the program. One week is a diet, day after day after day after day, it is soul crushing. Twice I live on the average food stamp budget  . I broke the rules, in that friends took me out to dinner and helped out. Both times I did it for two months each and could not wait for it to be over. I am a chef, I had every advantage. I had equipment, a great kitchen, I had transportation and the time to make everything myself. I did my best to eat healthfully and guess what. I still failed. It is impossible to get both the calories and the nutrition needed on this budget. Impossible!Rice and beans can only go so far. I was challenged a second time to do it as a diabetic. I am not diabetic, but the point was a good one. I had eaten a LOT of pasta and rice in my first challenge. What happens when I had to give that up? In the winter, with produce expensive, and the self imposed health restrictions, I went a little bit nuts trying to stay satiated. I really love my vegetables and I will never forget buying that one head of broccoli and dividing it up over several meals. This country does not need another celebrity to tell us how life is for ""these people."" These people are all around us and they are hungry. Republicans go on discussion boards and make the point that if they did not want to live in poverty they should have gone to college. Many have, jobs do not exist for every college graduate. Chat with your barista and see how many of them have advanced degrees. The truth is that all welfare is corporate welfare. It supplements the wages that the Walmarts and McDonald's restaurants refuse to pay. We need to have some compassion, stop hating the poor and try to understand them. Stop with the glib comments that show a total lack of understanding and donate to your local food bank. Keep in mind that no matter how many times you hear the story of the woman in the parking lot selling half of her food stamps for drug money, and using the rest for crab legs, and steak, and then driving off in her Rolls Royce wearing a fur coat and chatting on her new iphone it is still fiction."

On his TV show, Andrew goes all over the world looking for new tastes. In other words, he's sort of like the human version of Watson.""We have such a narrow definition of what is edible,"" he says. ""What I admire so much about Watson is I think it's going to change our food lives.""IBM, Bon Appetit, and the Institute of Culinary Education have collaborated to test and refine Chef Watson. This week they released a cookbook and an app in beta.The cocktail section in the new cookbook exemplifies the app's sometimes bewildering culinary innovations. Take cider muddled with pancetta (shown above) -- a meaty cocktail unlike anything I've ever imagined. I have to be honest -- that's one pairing I'm not sure I would endorse.But the good news is, Watson doesn't just process ones and zeros -- it can learn from flavor pairings that don't quite work.""It used to be that you had to program a computer for it to do something useful,"" says Florian Pinel (show above, black t-shirt), software engineer at IBM Chef Watson. ""Now we have these computers that can learn and reason a little bit like humans.""After talking about Chef Watson, I wanted to try it out for myself. So I went to see my friend Manoush Zomorodi, host of WNYC's technology and culture podcast New Tech City.Manoush and I (shown above) both like to eat. But while I love to cook and always go the extra mile for deliciousness, Manoush is all about mealtime efficiency. We set out to test Watson on two metrics: taste and convenience.We rummaged through Manoush's fridge and pulled out banana, avocado, Brussels sprouts, garlic, candied ginger, and jalapenos.Then we typed those ingredients into Watson and picked a recipe from among the options. It involved cooking avocado. We were skeptical, but we forged ahead.Chef Watson's recipe definitely had some bugs. But as they say, the proof is in the pudding, and these rich, garlicky-spicy Brussels sprouts did not disappoint.Listen to The Sporkful podcast through the player and subscribe in iTunes."

I muttered while hurriedly slapping some mascara on, being careful not to take my eyes off the mirror.""Well... It's just too hard! I don't want to get pregnant or give birth. And most of all, I don't want to have any of the pokey!""It was a good thing I was already done with my eye makeup at that point, because I'm pretty sure I would have ended up shaking with laughter and poking my eyes in the process. In our family, we say ""pokey"" for anything that refers to injections or poking yourself with a needle. Apparently, my son has heard our conception story often enough to remember that I had to go through A LOT to have him in our lives. Our son is an IVF baby. ""Oh, honey. Not everyone goes through that just to get pregnant. It's just that my body has a hard time making babies, so I needed all that stuff.""It was all I could say to remind my son that what I had to go through was not the natural way that most people experience. It was as far as I was willing to go in order not to say too much about sex and the whole reproductive process. I didn't think he, or I, was ready for that kind of conversation yet.Whenever I share some details with my son about how he was conceived, I always find myself trying to be really careful that I don't make it seem overly scientific. I don't ever want him to think that the route his father and I took was completely ""sterile,"" matter-of-fact, and unromantic.Though on the surface it may seem that way to some, the truth is that our experience was really quite romantic.My husband and I had several appointments where we were both around, and knew it took solid commitment, dedication and sacrifice from both of us to make it work.My husband was always around to assist me with the most difficult and most painful shots, in order to give me the hormones I needed to trick my body into thinking that it was getting ready for pregnancy. It didn't matter whether we were home or out at a banquet hall attending a wedding. He knew that when it was time for my injections, he had to show up to help me.My husband had to comfort me during those painful injections, when all I could do was lie on my stomach and cry in pain as I felt the fat needle and the viscous fluid being injected through my flesh.Both of us worried when I had some spotting after my embryo transfer.We held hands, cried and prayed together while on our drive to the hospital, rushing through intersections that early November morning as I bled at almost 20 weeks of gestation, terrified that I'd lost my baby, this baby we'd worked so hard for and hoped for.Aren't all those romantic? In spite of heavy reliance on predictability and timing, our incessant monitoring of numbers and obsessing over the slightest of symptoms perceived, we never felt more bonded, and I wouldn't trade any of it for a more traditional route.Romance shows up differently for different couples. Most of all, sometimes looking too hard for romance the way you expect it might make you miss the real things when they show up. Having someone stay with you in uncertain times...Having someone strong enough to cry and grieve with you in moments of pain...Having someone embrace you for all that you are, with all your sense of inadequacy and guilt...All of those are romantic AND more. They are real things that not only make your heart leap and melt, but, most of all, break it wide open so beautifully to flood your life with hope.This essay was originally published on Catharsis.

While she slips away into the advanced stages of this ferocious illness, I can't watch anything that illustrates the journey my family is on. Nonetheless, I applaud one outcome from the film; it is illuminating this ""neglected epidemic."" Maria Shriver in her recent Huff Post piece ""Help Me Wipe Out Alzhemer's Now"" shared these terrifying statistics:""Every 67 seconds, another one of us develops Alzheimer's. Women in their 60's are about twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's as breast cancer. With 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day, there will be 13.5 million of us with Alzheimer's by 2050."" And there is more: Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the nation and the only leading cause of death in the U.S. with no way to prevent, stop or even slow its progression according to the Alzheimer's Association. Now, add the enormous repercussions it has on the loved one's families. If you really wrap your mind around this, it can take your breath away. That I can attest to.First let me share a few of my tangible moments of beauty and grace while navigating this barbed path. I felt great joy watching my mother dance along the Hudson River as I photographed her as a Goddess; shared laughs when she emerged from her bedroom in an especially creative combination of clothes; experienced true love when her face lit up as I entered a room; let tears run down my cheeks as her kisses caressed the back of my hand; and believed my heart grew when I murmured ""I love you"" in her ear, moments before she fell asleep in her nursing home bed.Alzheimer's is having a crushing impact on my family as well. We see savings dwindle from paying for her constant care; careers put on hold to manage her daily medications, physical demands, and energetic wanderings (that often led to a visit with the local police); grandchildren no longer remembering her as the determined, fiercely positive woman she once was; and perhaps worst of all, her beloved husband of 67 years, now guilt ridden and lonely because he can no longer care for her at their home for over half a century. Five years ago, I photographed my mother (and father) for Goddess on Earth as Meng Po, the Chinese Goddess of Forgetfulness. This sacred myth tells us that as a soul prepares to be reborn, the Goddess Meng Po serves her tea of forgetfulness. Instantly cleared of the knowledge of past lives, Meng Po allows the soul to be made anew and the cycle of life continues. My mother's memory wasn't purged in an instant but in a slow, relentless march toward oblivion. To accompany her Meng Po portrait she had written; ""My memory is not what it used to be. I do forget and I do not remember everything. But my life is rich with daily, weekly, yearly experiences with my husband, my children, my grandchildren and my friends."" Today, she would not even be able to write her own name. But she is still Greta.This piece first appeared in GoddessonEarth.comFor more information on Goddess on Earth, visit the project's web site, Facebook or Twitter page."

He could have been imprisoned for what he said to me. That was almost 20 years ago, but I will never forget his words and their after effects.",2015-04-13,2015-04-07-1428444577-3302809-Ainsley.McWhaBlonde.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-07-1428444577-3302809-Ainsley.McWhaBlonde-thumb.JPG,"The agency director called me in for a one-on-one meeting, which was uncommon, but I knew what it was about. It was February, castings for Paris's Fall/Winter fashion week had already begun and for me, they hadn't been going well. It was because of my body. I sat down in the padded leather armchair across the desk from the director, a man in his late thirties, maybe early forties. (Years spent working in the modeling industry has skewed my ability to determine people's ages.) Oversized black and white images of semi-dressed girls lined the walls, blown-up photos from fashion shoots. Outside, it was raining. A sleeping Weimaraner lay curled up in the corner, snoring, oblivious to my fate. I wrung my hands. In a thick French accent, the director told me: ""Do not eat anything for the next two days. Drink only water. Go to Milan and for the next two weeks, really watch what you eat. Don't eat a lot and drink a lot of water."" This was not sound advice. When I returned from Italy, he said, it would be decided whether I was thin enough to walk in the Paris shows. I was 19 years old, five feet eleven and a half feet tall and, though I cannot disclose what I weighed (due to necessary guidelines for covering eating disorders), for a woman of my height, suffice to say it was certainly not enough. At this point, I had been modeling full-time for a year and a half after placing in the top 15 of an international agency's annual contest and winning a $50,000 two-year contract. Me at the height of my modeling careerThe problem? Four months earlier, I had weighed far less, and the director expected me to maintain that lower weight. The previous summer when I had first arrived in Paris, girls who I lived with at the agency model apartment had been coming home announcing that they had had ""the talk,"" and I vowed to not let that happen to me, too. I started by being selective with what I ate, and it progressed from there. I worked more, the other girls envied me and I believed I was closer to becoming a supermodel and acquiring the accompanying perks. When my old clothes didn't fit the way they used to, one of my bookers took me shopping, suggesting the new clothes I should buy to play this inevitable role. I never stopped eating altogether, but I ate very little. I was unhealthy, yet hawking the image of health. Since I lived on the other side of the world, away from family and friends, essentially alone, nobody witnessed my transformation aside from the girls I shared the apartment with and my agency. I worked every day. I left Paris before the sun came up to fly to Barcelona or Rome or Zurich or Frankfurt or Milan, returning home after dark, or staying over for a night or two then flying to the next job in another studio location. Once, but only once, I was force-fed by a photographer who wouldn't let me return to the set until I finished a bowl of pasta. That was an excruciating hour.This lifestyle was not sustainable. I learned this when the mood swings -- a frightening side effect of being malnourished and sleep-deprived -- became too much to handle. The January I was 19, I booked a shoot in Cancun, which included a week-long stay at a Club Med. At the 24-hour buffet, I ate more in five days than I had in the previous five months. Once I allowed myself to start eating, and with the endless options presented to me (Tacos! Ice cream! Pizza!), I couldn't stop. The dam had broken. I started to put weight back on, and even before the director called me in, I was dealing with the daily -- yet warped -- sensation of fatness. I showed up at castings feeling swollen and dejected. And this showed on my face, which, when you're trying to make a living off of looking happy, is bad for business. Instead of flying to Milan the day after the meeting, I flew to New York City, thinking that there, where the fashion market was slightly more forgiving of a slightly fuller figure, that I would be able to get my weight and eating under control. For the entire flight across the Atlantic, I felt like a cow and cried. I was a failure. In New York, my agent scheduled an appointment for me to meet with a nutritionist. At least this was a somewhat proactive step. But a nutritionist was not what I needed. I needed serious psychological help. Months of practically starving myself and thinking that this was not only a good idea, but also necessary, had actually resulted in me believing that I was fat and that I needed to continue losing weight -- even when there was no fat left for me to lose. Starvation will twist your thoughts like that. A fact I learned when I eventually returned home to my parents' house in the suburbs of Canada and started one-on-one counseling with a psychologist, treatment that also included a weekly group therapy session. What came next were months and months of costly rehabilitation to re-train my mind with the hopes that my body would follow.When I learned about France's recent law about hiring underweight models, I couldn't believe it. Paris has always been the strictest modeling market where weight is concerned. Meaning: Paris has always been the market that has demanded its girls be the thinnest. Any model will tell you this. The new law threatens to throw anyone hiring extremely underweight girls (with a Body Mass Index of less than 18) into jail for six months, or fine them up to 75,000 Euros. This applies to agents and clients alike. My old agency director? He could have been imprisoned for what he said to me. That was almost 20 years ago, but I will never forget his words and their after effects.   Now I am 37 years old. After going through my rehabilitative counseling, I went on to college for four years to study Psychology, hoping to someday help teenage girls with the issues that I had both dealt with and witnessed during my years as a teenaged model -- poor body image, non-existent self-esteem and eating disorders -- issues that impact non-models, too. At 24, after graduation, I was scouted to model again, and I returned to the job, albeit reluctantly, thinking that it would be a decent way to make good money for a short while. Really, I needed to prove to myself that I could do it, that I could succeed in this job that is seemingly as simple as standing there to get your picture taken, which it isn't. My face and image have been featured on magazine covers and high-fashion runways, in national and international fashion and beauty campaigns, television commercials and a Times Square billboard. I like to say that my grad school program was paid for by Oil of Olay and Virginia Slims. I went on to model until this past April when, having finally decided that my life needed a major overhaul, I moved from Brooklyn, where I had lived for the previous 10 years, to rural Idaho.Removed from the modeling world, I'm amazed at how little I consider my appearance anymore -- how little I think of my weight and my body and my skin and my hair. How I looked was a daily concern for most of my life, if only because it meant a paycheck -- sometimes a big one. These days, my body has stabilized to its natural weight, which, somewhat absurdly, happens to still be under the ""legal"" limit. If I were trying to model in France, under the new law, I would be told to eat more. In Idaho, I write for a local magazine, and I'm finally putting my Psychology degree to use, working as a community-based counselor. My clients are all women, aged 10 to 55, all dealing with issues ranging from abuse and suicide attempts to custody and chronic pain to severe depression and anxiety to absolute poverty. And it puts everything into perspective. Still, when I read the news of France's new law, I can't help but wonder where were these crusaders when I needed them. Not just me, but hundreds (maybe thousands) of young girls who didn't know better, all promised the same thing: If you're skinny enough, you will work.Me today Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter |   Contact HuffPost Women"

The Academy is for those who made the list to receive the rank of Sergeant Major. The school is a yearlong course designed to train these Senior Non-Commissioned Officers prior to their next duty assignment. While we were at Fort Bliss we began to hear word of a movie that was about to begin filming there. There was an article in the El Paso Times about it, as well as the post newspaper the Fort Bliss Bugle. The movie was set to star Michelle Monaghan, who you may know from many movies such as Mission Impossible III, and the HBO True Detective series. In addition, she is just as lovely off-screen as she is on-screen!Word of this movie was getting out, and there were postings on Facebook looking for extras. An email address was given out as well, if you were interested, all you had to do was make contact in order to receive a time, date, and location. I'm an introvert type who prefers to be heard and not seen, so the thought of actually doing this wasn't something I would normally consider. My oldest son who was almost 11 at the time and had a serious interest in film, would benefit the most from this experience. He was taking Tae Kwon Do classes, and after watching the latest Karate Kid movie featuring Jaden Smith and Taraji P. Henson, he was in love with the idea of starring in his own Karate movie. How often is a small town girl from Ohio confronted with an opportunity to show her son what making a movie is all about? NEVER! So I thought... what the heck, why not? We spend most of our weekends watching movies, why not be in one?And so we did...We participated in the Homecoming scene that was taped about two miles from where we lived on Biggs Airfield (a part of Fort Bliss).   After we spent about 5-6 hours on set, my son learned that making a movie is hard work, which requires the involvement of many talented people. Here is the writer and director of Fort Bliss, Claudia Myers, hard at work giving out instructions to everyone. Here's some more of the hardworking crew and extras...Another great thing about the movie is they were casting actual soldiers and their family members as well. You can really see the efforts of the creative talent behind the movie trying to keep the film as real as possible while touching on some key issues that plague the military today.If you haven't seen the movie Fort Bliss, then I highly suggest that you do. It's streaming on Netflix now, so make sure that you watch it. It's such an important film that addresses real issues that disrupt the lives of our country's service members. There are a number of matters that this film touches on that our brave men and women in uniform face. The acting is impeccable and the storyline is both heartfelt and real. Although, my son realized that making movies requires a lot more time than he is willing to give. He did get to experience an opportunity that may never present itself again. He got to be in a movie. And not just any movie, but a movie that I'm proud to associate myself with. And although if you blink, you will probably miss us; I'm still grateful to have been a teeny part of this film.So to all those involved in the making of this film...Thank you for letting us be a part of it!God bless you for telling this story, and God bless the men and women who selflessly put on the uniform, so that we can all sleep safe at night!-- Randi Evans is a writer for TheSidelined.com, you can read more of her work here.

I felt more lucky than frustrated when they decided to tow the plane away from the gate.As a result I got to spend an evening and morning with nearly 300 other stranded passengers, mostly Americans, who shared openly their thoughts about Hillary Clinton's predictable announcement that she wanted to be in charge of more than the decorations and Easter Egg rolling at the White House.There is nothing scientific about the group I hung out with -- some were older, some younger, some fit, some not, ethnically diverse, all in Paris for some reason or another, all among those I spoke to in economy class and remarkably patient in the many long lines that ensue after a flight is cancelled in order to get free lunch and hotel vouchers.""She is an amazing woman and a great leader. I have such confidence in her,"" said an elderly school teacher from the Norfolk, Virginia area. Her husband, in contrast, said that she paled in comparison to her husband, President Bill Clinton -- but that Jeb Bush, when people stopped to think about it was ""obviously far better than his President-brother.""Others I spoke to either saw her in heroic, ceiling-shattering terms or saw her as a more cold-blooded calculator fashioning her political views according to what her campaign machinery and mandarins dictated. Some saw her as a panderer to identity politics in America. One person said she'd be a ""tool of Netanyahu."" A number saw her as unexciting and wished that the Democrats had the guts to put forward a tough challenger to her.But going back to that first husband-wife standoff over Hillary, it struck me that if indeed America delivers a battle between its contemporary political aristocracies, the Bushes and the Clintons, that the challenge for Hillary will be to overcome comparisons not with her Republican rival but with her peripatetic global do-gooding husband. Bill Clinton's strategic depth is palpable and he, during and after his presidency, came to personify the better dimensions of 'globalization.'Hillary's file runs thinner. For example, in Jonathan Allen's blunt, Maureen Dowd-directed roster of what we know of Hillary, he starts with ""Hillary is a Hawk,"" another way of saying that she is stuck deep in a groove and not strategically nimble. That is an immediate contrast that will matter to many who ponder HRC filling in the title of Commander-in-Chief and only able to hold the throttle in the charge, bomb, and invade position.Jeb Bush too may find himself figuring out ways to differentiate his brand of Bush-ness from 12 years of his kin holding the keys to the White House. Jeb seems like he'd be less fun to have a beer with at a barbecue and more fun playing chess against -- and that, in my book, is a good thing."

But a broad deal to keep Tehran from building nuclear weapons has been reached. Alas, any accord will face significant opposition. Some Americans -- including many Republican members of Congress--fear peace more than war.Yet Tehran, though an ugly regime, does not threaten America. The U.S. is the globe's greatest military power with the most sophisticated nuclear arsenal and finest conventional force. For this reason alone Tehran is unlikely to attack America. Iran would cease to exist. Tehran's leaders are malign actors, but nevertheless have reason to feel insecure. In 1953 Washington helped overthrow democratically elected Prime Minister Mohamed Mossedegh. The U.S. gave refuge to the brutal Shah after he was overthrown in 1979 and then backed Saddam Hussein's aggressive war against Iran. In the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq invasion a number of American analysts publicly advocated attacking Iran. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama regularly declared military action to be ""on the table."" Israeli leaders also called for attacking Iran. Said Ariane Tabatabai of the Belfer Center ""In the past few years, the threat of an Israeli attack became a major concern for many Iranians.""Thus, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) had it exactly reversed when he claimed, ""A nuclear-capable Iran is the gravest threat facing America today."" Washington still has good reason to oppose Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, the importance of the Middle East has been inflated. The energy market is global. Regional instability is perpetual. An Islamic nuclear bomb already exists, in ever-dangerous Pakistan. Starting another, bigger Middle Eastern war would be more dangerous for America than living with an Iranian bomb.Israel is concerned over a possible Iranian nuclear weapon, but when asked in 2011 whether Iran would drop a nuke on Israel, former Defense Minister Ehud Barak responded ""Not on us and not on any other neighbor."" In December 2010 former Mossad head Meir Dagan said that Tehran's Islamic government is ""rational"" and ""considering all the implications of their action."" Israeli Defense Force's Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz made a similar point: ""I think the Iranian leadership is comprised of very rational people."" Who would recognize Israel's overwhelming retaliatory capacity.No one knows the extent of Tehran's nuclear ambitions. But Washington's ally the Shah started the Iranian program. Tehran's motive, noted former Mossad head and national security adviser Efraim Halevy, ""is not the confrontation with Israel, but the desire to restore to Iran the greatness of which it was long deprived."" Iran does not appear to have an active weapons program. In November 2007 the National Intelligence Estimate concluded: ""We judge with high confidence that in fall 2003, Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program,"" though it was keeping its options open. The IAEA stated that Iran's program ""was stopped rather abruptly"" that year.The IAEA and U.S. later found some activities that could be weapons-related, but, reported James Risen of the New York Times, the ""information has not been significant enough for the spy agencies to alter their view that the weapons program has not been restarted."" Risen cited a U.S. intelligence official who said: ""Mossad does not disagree with the U.S. on the weapons program."" In January 2012 James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, told the Senate: ""We assess Iran is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons, in part by developing various nuclear capabilities that better position it to produce such weapons, should it choose to do so. We do not know, however, if Iran will eventually decide to build nuclear weapons."" In October 2013 David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, told the Senate: ""Although Iran is engaged in nuclear hedging, no evidence has emerged that the regime has decided to build nuclear weapons.""In the aftermath of Washington's 2003 Iraq invasion Tehran offered to negotiate, only to be spurned by the Bush administration. Negotiations began to move seriously after the 2013 election of Hassan Rouhani as Iran's president.The interim Joint Plan of Action, reached in November 2013 and extended through March, froze Iran's number of centrifuges, ended 20 percent enrichment, reduced (with the objective of ultimately eliminating) stockpiles of 20 percent enriched uranium, froze supplies of five percent enriched uranium, stopped work at Arak nuclear reactor, and increased IAEA surveillance. When the negotiations were extended Tehran agreed to convert its remaining 20 percent enriched stockpiles, restricted its nuclear R&D, and added snap inspections of centrifuge production. By all reports Iran has fulfilled its commitments. Said the Arms Control Association's Daryl Kimball, the agreement has ""halted the most worrisome projects that Iran has."" Admittedly, these restrictions are not enough, since, for instance, Iran continues to enrich uranium to 3.5 percent. Moreover, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano acknowledged that ""we are not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran."" However, only negotiation is likely to yield additional limits. Amano noted that the agency needed Tehran's cooperation.For years hawks erroneously predicted that Iran was about to build nuclear weapons. Instead, negotiations have reduced Tehran's ""breakout"" capacity, the time necessary to enrich enough uranium to make one bomb. Before the JPOA Iran's breakout time was a month or so. Now it is two to three months. The U.S. hopes to push the breakout time up to a year. Tehran will remain a threshold nuclear state, but it already is one--legally under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.The basic dispute today is whether the West demands complete termination of Iran's nuclear activities or agrees to limits on centrifuges and provisions for intrusive oversight to provide advance warning of any Iranian breakout attempt. The choice is a classic example between the unattainable perfect and realistic good. Iran is unlikely to surrender: there is broad domestic support for Iran's nuclear program and even friends of the West do not favor national humiliation. In contrast, a more limited pact could discourage development of a nuclear bomb. Ryan Costello of the National Iranian American Council pointed out: ""No nation has ever built a nuclear weapon under the watch of IAEA inspectors, including the six non-nuclear weapon states that enrich uranium on their own soil.""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a dramatic appearance on Capitol Hill to oppose the talks, but none of his objections were persuasive. There is no evidence that Iran is bent on conflict. New York Times columnist Roger Cohen noted that ""greater economic contact with the world and the gradual emergence of a young generation of Iranians drawn to the West"" could moderate Tehran's foreign policy. Cheating is possible but less likely if Tehran gains more than it loses from the agreement. New threats actually would increase Iran's incentive to build nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, the prime minister's remarks, argued Rep. Jan Schakowsky, (D-Ill.), were ""an effort to stampede the United States into war once again."" (Netanyahu advocated America's disastrous invasion of Iraq.)Uranium enrichment may be the most important area of dispute. While technical arguments fly freely, the issue is fundamentally political. Noted the Crisis Group, Tehran has no need for so many centrifuges, other than to reject Western interference in Iran's affairs, just as the allies have ""no need to exaggerate the breakout risks of Iran's current inventory of a few thousand obsolete IR-1 centrifuges, which are under the most stringent IAEA inspection regime."" Compromise is required.Tehran must be permitted to enrich uranium and conduct nuclear research, while accepting barriers between civilian and potential nuclear programs, including steps to hinder reversibility, with meaningful international oversight. Both Washington and Tehran must receive sufficient benefits upfront to justify battling powerful vested interests against peace. Steady progress in future years will be necessary to preserve support for the deal. It might be necessary, suggested the Crisis Group, to ""postpone some difficult concessions until both sides have become accustomed to a new relationship.""Such an approach likely is the best the West can expect. Having endured years of escalating penalties, Tehran isn't likely to accept less. Even many Iranians inclined toward the West back the program. Iran's leaders have no reason to trust Washington, while U.S. officials who blithely imagine an easy military solution would be setting the stage for another extended Middle Eastern disaster.Compromise also is the best that Tehran can expect. Only reintegration into the international economy would meet Iran's economic and security needs. Rejecting limits on its nuclear activities would ensure persistent economic crisis and geopolitical isolation and risk an Israeli and/or U.S. military strike. Iran cannot hope for more than the old Reagan adage, ""trust but verify,"" since Tehran has not always been forthcoming. There are other issues between the West and Iran. The Washington Post complained that the administration ""has declined to counter increasingly aggressive efforts by Iran to extend its influence across the Middle East."" Netanyahu claimed much the same: ""the world should demand that Iran ... stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East."" Yet Tehran, in contrast to America (as well as Israel and even Saudi Arabia), has not bombed, invaded, or occupied neighboring states. The Islamic regime's military spending trails that of Israel, Iraq, and Qatar. Saudi Arabia devotes more than five times as much money as Tehran to the military. The regional environment remains extremely hostile to Tehran. For decades the U.S. has intervened all around Iran. Washington backed Hussein's Iraq in attacking Iran. Israel has bombed and invaded its neighbors when deemed necessary. Saudi Arabia backed the Taliban in Afghanistan, funded radical Sunni groups in Syria, and intervened militarily in Bahrain, which has a Shiite majority. Who is the most aggressive power?Demanding a regional Iranian surrender would risk the nuclear talks. In contrast, resolving the nuclear issue would improve the chances of addressing other disputes. A more prosperous Iran would naturally have more regional influence, but there are important areas for U.S.-Iran cooperation. The two governments could work together in Afghanistan and anti-piracy operations. Iran is a de facto ally against the Islamic State (and before that against both al-Qaeda and the Taliban). Further improvements in relations with Washington could draw Iran away from some of its more radical attachments. Said Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council: after signing a nuclear agreement the two nations ""can behave in a way that they do not use their energy against each other.""Nevertheless, negotiation critics promise a better result by rejecting the proposed deal. ""Call their bluff,"" insisted Netanyahu. Even Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, warned U.S. officials that expanding sanctions would wreck the talks. But radical GOP hawks don't care. Sen. Cotton insisted: ""The United States must cease all appeasement, conciliation and concessions towards Iran, starting with the sham nuclear negotiations."" His position is simple: Iran should surrender.Ironically, such a demand would encourage Iran to again expand its nuclear capability. Even many Iranians well-disposed toward America support their nation's nuclear program and do not want to be ruled from abroad. President Rouhani would face well-founded criticism for ""appeasement"" if he proposed yielding to such demands. Noted NIAC's Trita Parsi: Rouhani ""wants and needs a deal, but can't afford one that will end his political career in Iran."" Iran did not respond to prior pressure by crawling to Washington. Noted Parsi and Reza Marashi of NIAC: ""When Washington imposed on Iran the most comprehensive sanctions regime in history, Tehran did not capitulate. Rather, it responded to pressure with pressure."" Iran added centrifuges and increased reprocessing capabilities. Only the 2013 JPOA halted this process. A congressional demand for Tehran's capitulation would risk restarting Iranian efforts, ending enhanced inspections, and encouraging Tehran to follow North Korea in leaving the NPT entirely.Having blown up the negotiations, the U.S. then would find it difficult to maintain international support for sanctions. China and Russia already have reason to break with America. Europeans looking forward to business with Iran would blame Washington for the renewed crisis. War might be the only alternative to a nuclear Iran. Yet that would entail bombing a nation which had not threatened America and, indeed, had good reason to arm in response to Washington's threats. Moreover, a military strike likely would only delay rather than stop the program. Tehran then would have reason to move ahead as swiftly as possible, since nothing else would protect Iran from further attack. Thus, negotiations remain the only realistic option to prevent an Iranian bomb. The West must convince Tehran that it doesn't need a bomb. Pressure only goes so far. Equally important are benefits for abandoning any military designs. Noted James Clapper: ""Iran's technical advancement, particularly in uranium enrichment, strengthens our assessment that Iran has the scientific, technical, and industrial capacity to eventually produce nuclear weapons, making the central issue its political will to do so."" In his view Tehran would base its decision on a cost-benefit basis, including such interests as security and prestige. Thus, the benefits of any settlement must exceed the costs.Nearly four decades of hostility and conflict between the U.S. and Iran have malformed America's relations with the entire Middle East. Washington has found itself constantly at war, permanently allied with authoritarian regimes, and repeatedly suffering the consequences of previous mistakes. A possible Iranian nuclear weapon is as much an unintended consequence as cause of U.S. policy.However, the ongoing negotiations provide a unique opportunity to simultaneously limit the spread of nuclear weapons and reduce tensions in the Middle East. Americans should embrace the possibility of peace. Tehran is an ugly regime, but that only makes an enforceable nuclear agreement more critical. The Obama administration has no more important responsibility today than to finalize a workable nuclear agreement with Iran. For the people of America and Iran, failure is not an option.An earlier version of this post first appeared at Forbes online."

The ACHE Act enacts an immediate moratorium on the practice of blowing up the mountains over our homes because of the implications on human health.""CREDO calls the ACHE Act campaign ""a smart approach for beginning to deal with a public health crisis Appalachian communities have faced for far too long - but it needs national grassroots support to gain traction in Congress."" From the petition: The coal industry is waging a war on Appalachia, detonating millions of pounds of diesel fuel and explosives daily to rip the top off of mountains and access seams of coal contained within."

While there were no public protests over the meeting between the two presidents, there was grumbling on local radio and on social media.Likely Republican 2016 presidential candidate and Miami resident, Jeb Bush, who is close to conservative Cuban exiles, summed up the negative feelings of hardliners in a tweet: ""Why legitimize a cruel dictator of a repressive regime?"" A SMOKE BREAK SPARKS AN INTERESTObama has been taking the temperature of the Cuban-American community for years.His first practical lesson took place over a smoke break outside a fund-raiser at the Kaleidoscope Club in Chicago in 2004 when he was running for the U.S. Senate.Former Miami City manager Joe Arriola told Obama - both men were trying to quit cigarettes - how to appeal to Cuban-American voters.""I told him not to listen to the crazy right-wing in Miami ... that my kids' generation thought differently,"" recalled Arriola, a prominent Cuban-American politician.Arriola, invited Obama to Miami that fall for a fund-raiser that netted his Illinois Senate campaign $50,000.""We brought him down several times after that. He would have breakfast with us and we would pick up people to introduce to him,"" Arriola said.The chance encounter in Chicago sparked interest by Obama in the changes in the once solidly Republican Cuban-American enclave in south Florida.The Miami fundraiser was kept quiet because Arriola, a 67-year-old former Republican, was still serving the city of Miami, and another participant, Manny Diaz, was the mayor. They were unsure how the Cuban exile community - known for taking to the streets - would react.The encounter over a cigarette was also the beginning of a family friendship that would see two of Arriola's sons - Ricky and Eddy - join Obama's finance committee in both of his presidential runs.That a small group of Cuban-Americans saw purpose in helping a rising Senate candidate in Chicago turned out to be something that would help shape U.S. policy.""They identified Obama early on and saw the potential and brought him to Miami and got him immersed,"" said Carlos Saladrigas, one of a dozen Cuban-Americans who participated in the 2004 fund-raiser at the home of developer Jorge Perez. GENERATIONAL CHANGEArriola's message about changes in Miami exile thinking was not just an idle boast. Polling showed a generational shift was taking place as younger Cuban-American leaders emerged who were more open to engagement with Cuba than a previous generation, who left the island in the early days after Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution.During his first presidential campaign, and as part of a wider foreign policy vision that favored more openness to dialog, Obama advocated direct talks with Cuba, and even said he was willing to sit down with Raul Castro.He traveled to Miami to deliver a speech laying out a plan to undo restrictions on remittances and travel to the island for Cuban-American families, while keeping the long-standing trade embargo in place.In his re-election in 2012, Obama won almost 50 per cent of south Florida's Cuban-American vote, almost double what Democrats had been used to getting.The White House also reached out to other, younger voices in the Cuban-American community, including Felice Gorordo, co-founder of Roots of Hope, a non-partisan group of young Cuban-American activists.How far could the administration go without sparking rioting in Miami, one former top Obama adviser for Latin America policy, Dan Restrepo, asked Gorordo during a 2012 meeting to discuss reforming Cuba policy.""I said: 'Shaking hands (with Castro).' That's something that's hard to swallow in Miami. Anything up to that is tolerable,"" Gorordo told Reuters.When an unexpected handshake between Obama and Castro became the most talked-about VIP moment at Nelson Mandela's memorial service in December 2013, Obama's aides took note of the muted reaction from Cuban-Americans.By then, secret talks with Cuba were already under way, aimed at releasing a jailed U.S. contractor in Cuba, Alan Gross, while also restoring diplomatic relations.Obama appears to have accurately gauged the mood in Miami.One weekend in January, Cuban exiles protesting Obama's outreach to Havana were far outweighed by demonstrators protesting the captivity of Lolita, a killer whale at Miami Seaquarium.

Photo: Stephanie Berger  Dedicated theatergoers who try to see the best of the best are hereby alerted, during this ridiculously overloaded April, to make a quick detour to Brooklyn. Ibsen's powerful Ghosts is the play; director Richard Eyre provides an altogether gripping production; and Lesley Manville's portrayal as Helene Alving makes for indispensable viewing. Given that this is a brief engagement of only twenty-nine performances at the BAM Harvey Theater, it will necessarily reach a limited audience. Connoisseurs of fine acting will do themselves a favor and be part of that audience.The excellence begins with Eyre's adaptation, which streamlines the play--it flies by in an intermissionless ninety minutes--and freshens what in starchier translations can seem archaic. This production originated at the Almeida Theatre in Islington in the fall of 2013. It transferred to the Trafalgar Studios in the West End last winter, where it won Olivier Awards for Manville and as Best Revival. Eyre has contrived with set designer Tim Hatley to stage the play in three spaces: a living room with translucent panels backed by a full dining room, behind which is a porch which in turn looks out on the Norwegian vista. Thus, the downstage players can observe what is happening inside; when Helene overhears Oswald and Regina repeating the seduction of her mother by his father, she--and we--""see"" them as translucent ghosts. By the final scene of the play, of course, the ghosts of the past are downstage front and center in all-too-clear view. Eyre--formerly director of the National Theatre, more recently the director of the London/Broadway musical Mary Poppins--also has masterful lighting from Peter Mumford, both in the shadows and in a startlingly stunning orange fantasia of deathbed daybreak. Manville is best known for her screen career, notably eight films with writer/director Mike Leigh (including the role of Kitty Gilbert in his 1999 Gilbert & Sullivan film, ""Topsy-Turvy""). The actress began on stage with the Royal Court and the RSC; her only prior New York appearance was in the original cast of Caryl Churchill's Top Girls at Joseph Papp's Public Theater in 1982.The star is well supported. Will Keen is highly effective as the moralizing but ultimately morally-weak Pastor Manders (even if he does look disconcertingly like David Hyde Pierce). Brian McCardie is suitably blustery as the hired man, Jacob. Charlene McKenna, the only actor other than Manville who appeared in both the Almeida and West End productions, does even better as Regina. She patiently dishes up exposition as the ornamental housemaid, but then--once her parentage is revealed--stands up to, and forcefully combats, Helene.   Billy Howle and Lesley Manville in Ibsen's Ghosts. Photo: Stephanie Berger  The one newcomer to the cast is Billy Howle, as Oswald. His elite-artist sophistication makes way to fear, desperation and finally outright horror; the closing scene between him and his mother is terrible, in the best sense of the world. Howle's syphilitic attack and Manville's frozen terror as she contemplates the vial of morphine is likely to stay with you.Adaptor/director Eyre and his supporting players make this a production to be reckoned with, but it is Manville who puts this Ghosts on its own rarefied plateau. Broadway audiences have this season seen sterling performances from Carey Mulligan (in Skylight), Ruth Wilson (in Constellations) and Helen Mirren (in The Audience). No need for comparisons, but Lesley Manville in Ghosts is simply not to be missed. . Ibsen's  Ghosts, adapted and directed by Richard Eyre, opened April 12, 2015 and continues through May 3 at BAM Harvey Theater"
