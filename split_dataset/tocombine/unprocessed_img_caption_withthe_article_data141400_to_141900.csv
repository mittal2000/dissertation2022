0,FOOD & DRINK,Lunch Monitor: Helping Your Child Eat Better in School,"Marcus Samuelsson, Contributor
Award-Winning Chef, Restaurateur & Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lunch-monitor-helping-you_us_5b9d92e3e4b03a1dcc89b015,"Packing lunches and going over menus is a great way to make small changes in the way your kids eat. You can also go a step farther and help change school cafeteria menus. Most schools lack the funds to makeover their kitchens, but parents can help. How can you make a difference?",2013-10-04,"FILE - In this Sept. 4, 2013, file photo, students at the Maurice J. Tobin K-8 School in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood eat free lunches consisting of a sandwich with meat, a vegetable dish, a piece of fruit, and milk. The Agriculture Department says that around half a percent of schools _ or 524 schools out of around 100,000 _ have dropped out of the federally-subsidized national school lunch program since the government put new standards for healthier foods in place last year. (AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d92e326000035007fedcf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was recently a part of an event that set the world record for the most number of kids cooking with their parents. Having cooked with my Grandmother Helga growing up, I loved seeing so many parents instilling interest and enthusiasm for cooking with their kids. However, one comment I heard over and over at the event was from the parents, who are working hard to promote healthy habits at home, but wonder if similar messages are being taught at school.Whether it's from parents themselves or in the news, the state of school lunches is getting a lot of attention and for good reason. A study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association said that nearly 40 percent of an average child's daily calories are eaten while they're in school. Parents want to ensure that their kids are getting fresh, nutritious, and tasty food and schools want to make sure that food satisfies students so they are attentive in class. These objectives sound similar, but they're not. Packing lunches and going over menus is a great way to make small changes in the way your kids eat. You can also go a step farther and help change school cafeteria menus. Most schools lack the funds to makeover their kitchens, but parents can help. How can you make a difference? Work with your school to help make positive changes together. Some parents I've met have joined their children's school's health and wellness committee. Another suggestion is to observe Meatless Monday, an initiative that I'm a big fan of. Here are some ideas you can try at home: Go over the school menus and talk with your child about what items he or she likes to eat. If kids don't recognize some of the foods, add them to the grocery list and try them as a family. When I was a student in Sweden, lunch usually consisted of some kind of smoked, grilled or cured fish, some potatoes and greens. While that meal may seem exotic to American school kids today, what I didn't have growing up was exposure to other ethnic flavors and ingredients. Make some Latin, Asian or African-inspired meals and your children won't be surprised if arroz con pollo, spring rolls or couscous salad makes it onto the menu at school. Of course, some foods are both familiar and nutritious, like most whole grains. Whole grains, like brown rice, are high in fiber and help keep you feeling fuller, longer. This is one example of something that can be found in the cafeteria or parents can choose to pack for lunch, like the Fully Loaded Rice recipe found here. Want another option? I've recently teamed up with The Uncle Ben's Brand on their Ben's Beginners Cooking Contest. We not only broke the record for the most families cooking together, but they're going even further to encourage kids to cook. The Ben's Beginners Cooking Contest not only rewards kids for getting in the kitchen at home with a cash prize, but there's also a prize for schools -- the three schools with the most participation in the contest will each win a $30,000 school cafeteria makeover. It's the small things that can make a big impact so I encourage all of you to see what changes you can make with your family. Post your ideas and images on my Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages using the hashtag #schoollunch and I can't wait to hear from you all."

Similarly",2013-10-04,"Capitol Hill police officers look at a car following a shooting on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2013. A police officer was reported injured after gunshots at the U.S. Capitol, police said Thursday. They locked down the entire complex, at least temporarily derailing debate over how to end a government shutdown.

This week it’s been particularly hard. First the Federal government shutdown halted the WIC program, leaving 9 million mothers and infants without vital nutrition assistance. Then NIH turned away dozens of children who were scheduled to begin experimental cancer treatments, also because of the shutdown. And finally there was the news that Miriam Carey, the woman who was killed while leading police on a chase between the White House and the Capitol yesterday had been suffering from postpartum depression. The events are all examples of what should be the fundamental responsibility of society -- supporting and protecting its most fragile citizens -- and how we are failing miserably at the job. Each year, about 13,400 children are diagnosed with cancer, which is the number one cause of death by disease of kids in the U.S. Yet the same lawmakers who are standing before cameras this week demanding that clinical trials be reinstated also voted to cut the NIH research budget for childhood cancer research dramatically in recent years. WIC, too has been cut recently, by about $200 million since last year. Between 11 and 20 percent of all pregnant women are estimated to suffer from postpartum depression, which translates to close to a million in the U.S. each year. Yet medical providers -- and certainly health insurance companies -- can’t agree on how to screen and treat patients for it, and who should be doing that screening and treating. We will probably never know why Carey did what she did, and whether more mental health resources might have helped her. Similarly, however much we spend on curing kids of cancer or supplying mothers with formula and lactation support, there will always been some who fall through the net. But it seems we only pay attention to those who need us at moments of crisis, when they are in need every single day. It’s always tough to be a struggling young mother. But maybe this week the rest of us will notice and remember."

The new way to serve the miniature cabbages is... fried!I've never been one to follow trends, but after sampling them a few times, my husband, Marc, begged me to make them at home. It took a few weeks for me to consent, but I finally gave in and came up with my own version of deep fried Brussels sprouts.The reason I was hesitant is simple: the succulent morsels are fattier than the foods I usually like to eat at home, or for that matter, than those I like to publish. But as Marc says, a little oil doesn't hurt anyone now and then! Who can argue with that?Here, the Brussels sprouts are flash-fried and then tossed with lime juice, garlic and cayenne. The lime cuts through the richness of the oil while the garlic and cayenne add a wonderful kick to the otherwise sweet-as-candy Brussels.You may not want to make this recipe every day, and you may want to consume it in moderation. But I can promise you that after tasting these fried jewels, you'll understand why the petits cabbages have managed to seduce so many chefs and foodies alike!Flash-Fried Brussels Sprouts with Garlic and LimeServes 4 Active time: 20 min1 large garlic clove - skinned and crushed (use a microplane grater) 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne 1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 1 1/2 lbs (680 g) Brussels sprouts - rinsed, patted dry, trimmed and cut in half lengthwise canola or peanut oil for deep fryingStep 1: Place the garlic, salt, cayenne, lime juice and olive oil in a small bowl. Whisk until well blended and set aside.Step 2: Heat a deep fryer to 375°F (190°C). Place the Brussels sprouts in a wire basket and dip them in the oil. Immediately cover the pan to prevent the hot oil from splattering on you or your counter top (the Brussels have a very high moisture content and intense splattering will occur during the first minute of cooking). Fry the Brussels sprouts for 5 to 6 minutes, until golden-brown. Drain on paper towels and quickly blot them with more paper towels. Place the Brussels in a large bowl. Drizzle with the garlic-lime dressing and toss until well coated. Serve piping hot!Cook's note: If you don't have a deep fryer, you can fry the Brussels sprouts in a large skillet on your stove. Pour enough oil to reach 1 1/2"" up the sides of the pan. Heat the oil until it reaches 375°F (190°C) and proceed with step 2.Have you ever had Brussels spouts raw? They are also superb prepared that way, as in this Shaved Brussels sprouts and Yukon Gold potato blinis with balsamic reduction."
