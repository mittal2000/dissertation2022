0,WELLNESS,Bipolar Disorder: What a Family (Or Friend) Might See and What a Family Can Do,"Lloyd I. Sederer, MD, Contributor

(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1eaf2200008300d9801f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nearly 1 percent of people suffer from bipolar disorder (sometimes referred to as ""manic depression""). Bipolar disorder is a mental illness major mood swings of mania (bipolar I) or hypomania (a less intense form of mania called bipolar II) and depression. We see in the press that Catherine Zeta-Jones has admitted herself to a hospital for treatment of what has been identified as bipolar II: This form of bipolar disorder can produce considerable distress as well as difficulty meeting life's demands -- but without (yet) resulting in a full blown manic attack. People with bipolar disorder, I or II, with good treatment, self-care and supportive family and friends can -- and do -- live full and productive lives. Without effective treatment, bipolar disorder can have a devastating effect on the person and their family, relationships and work. What Might Bipolar Disorder Look Like to Family or Friends?Because bipolar disorder involves both depressive and manic states, either mood problem can herald the recurrence of the condition. But I will focus here about what you might see during an emerging manic or hypomanic episode. In fact, mania typically progresses from excitement to hypomania and, if not controlled, can escalate to mania. So what you will see first is probably hypomania.Over the course of days to weeks, your family member or friend starts sleeping less and less. He or she seems to have rather unlimited energy and is full of ideas. At first, the person may be funny and pleasant to be around, but soon that mood will become more irritable and unstable. Your loved one may start drinking more or using drugs secretly -- a very common problem in people with bipolar conditions. If the person was on medication for bipolar disorder, he or she has probably stopped taking it (causing the problem to come back) or will want to discontinue because it can dim the feeling of excitement, a very desirable, though problematic, feeling for someone with this illness. Money may be missing from where you keep it or from your bank account. Bad judgment is common during a hypomania, or in a full manic state: Your loved one may spend money recklessly and engage in risky behaviors, including casual (and unprotected) sex, gambling, driving at high speeds, and frequenting neighborhoods and settings where no good is known to happen. Your loved one may accuse you of being boring, oppressive, or ruining his or her life or hopes. As time goes by and if the illness is not treated, the excitement mounts and a person will be unable to get anything done; behaviors can become progressively more threatening to the safety and wellbeing of the family. Commonsense talk seems to go when you try to reason with the person who is now ill.What Can You Do?Faced with mounting evidence of serious problems and a family's efforts at reasoning defied, with worry and love driving them, a family may want to push harder, insist that their loved one faces facts -- does something! Tempers can escalate and each side digs in more deeply. The first thing you can do is what not to do, which is to not get into fights with your loved one. This may be the hardest prescription of all. What can work is a combination of listening and leverage. There is much to say about this, which I do in my book for families. I believe that all behavior, even illness behavior, serves a purpose. We just may not know yet what it is. By  listening and asking questions, you may find out -- not by crossing swords. Leverage is about a family being a two-way street: You get and you give. As a family or friend, what supports are you providing? Like a cell phone, money, car, even a place to stay. These are leverage points that can be used to negotiate for what needs to be done. What does a loved one need to do -- ultimately in their interest -- to continue to receive money, use the car, or stay together? Avoiding a fight is not the same thing as being disengaged. In fact, it's staying just as involved -- in a different way. It is hard to not get into a fight, you may need help. The second thing, therefore, is don't go it alone. Mental health problems, including addictions, are among the most common medical problems that exist. That means that there are others -- in your extended family and among their friends and co-workers -- who have been down the same road. Who can you confide in? Is there a spouse, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, friend, or someone who has had a depression, addiction, traumatic disorder or other mental problem and is open about it (and, thankfully, more people are)? That's someone to turn to. You can turn to a primary care doctor or clergy, someone who has known your loved one for some time. Families can turn to school counselors or employee assistance programs at work. Advocacy organizations, like a local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or the Mental Health America (MHA), are terrific resources that I almost always suggest; these organizations are staffed by experienced and trained people. NAMI has families who have been there. These organizations provide information and referral, by phone or in person. And they are free! Don't go it alone. This lesson has been learned with every persistent illness, including diabetes, colitis, cancer, Alzheimer's and countless other conditions. Mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, are no different. Third, learn about the mental health system of care, its treatments, its rules and how to work with and bend the rules. I am not talking about going to psychology graduate school. I am talking about becoming an informed and vocal advocate for your loved one. Health care in general -- not just mental health -- now demands informed and assertive families and consumers. Fourth -- and this is also hard, but no different from illnesses of all sorts -- you will need to think of managing the illness as more of a marathon than a sprint. Managing all but short-term illnesses (like infections or broken bones) means taking a long view. Sticking with it. A family's morale and determination will be tested. ""Never, ever, give up."" While often difficult to predict, a person's involvement in care or their illness improves. Mental health professionals have seen this again and again. You need to know this. Don't lose hope, don't give up. Take the long view, in your mind and with your efforts. RecoveryRecovery is a word that does not only apply to addictions. Recovery is about having a life of meaning, purpose, dignity, relationships and contribution. It is what we all want, and it is possible with mental illnesses like bipolar disorder, and the many other faces of mental illness. As we watch how Ms. Zeta-Jones manages her illness, there may be much to learn from someone so talented -- so successful, and yet ill -- about how to not let bipolar disorder, or any mental or addictive disease, derail or destroy a life or a family.Dr. Sederer's book for families who have a member with a mental illness, The Family Guide to Mental Health Care, is now available.www.askdrlloyd.com The opinions expressed here are solely mine as a psychiatrist and public health advocate.

For others who just couldn't wait to get out of their terrible weather, Vegas is the perfect answer -- and Cinco De Mayo begins the madness!Cinco de Mayo So what is Cinco de Mayo? It is a Mexican holiday that celebrates a victory in some town somewhere in Mexico but... Americans usually don't care about all that history and most Mexicans don't even celebrate it in Mexico! So what is it to Americans and the Latino population... An excuse to party!The pool parties are already in full swing, featuring the hottest names in the electronic dance music genre -- from Calvin Harris to Tiesto -- expect full on summer madness starting the second of May on through the fifth. The line-ups are crazy and the parties are even crazier. What better to shake off the spring blues than an 8,000 person pool party that makes Cabo San Lucas look tame?With temperatures in the upper 90s, bring your sombrero and get ready for some heavy drinking because the party doesn't stop when the sun goes down!What to do? Each year Vegas hosts one of the biggest boxing matches of the year over this vaunted weekend. This year we see Floyd Mayweather (again) vs. Robert Guerrero. Thousands will pay thousands to go to the MGM and watch the slugfest. Others will be looking for different action at night which may take them to the Supercross races to watch some high-flying stunts.Let's not forget that if you don't care for either of these events you can still head down to the sports book and place your bets on the Kentucky Derby!What Now? Okay, so you've partied all day, saw a boxing match, and still have some fight (pun intended) left in you? Why not hit (again -- pun intended) one of the best clubs in the world and take in some Vegas nightlife? Those same amazing DJs you saw during the day are spinning until the wee hours of the morning! MGM has just christened their new club, Hakkasan, so why not check out the latest and greatest Vegas has to offer?Home Sweet Home!?!? After this is all said and done you get to return to your terrible weather and spend some time daydreaming of how epic it all was but, hey -- Memorial Day is only a few weeks away, right?"
2,STYLE & BEAUTY,I Don't Think I Want to Meet My 'Match',"Cameron Frye, Contributor
Cameron Frye",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meet-your-match_us_5b9d1e8ce4b03a1dcc849cf7,"I filled out my profile and said what I wanted, told them what I was looking for and evidently, I'm into drunk, sex-obsessed short men who have no ambition, but are baby crazy. Thanks!",2013-05-02,"USA, New Jersey, Jersey City, Bored couple sitting at bar counter",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1e8c240000510094f2c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"No surprise to anyone, I see a shrink. I know, I seem so level-headed and on the right track. Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a train wreck in a glass case of emotions. But I do whatever I have to do to maintain some sort of semblance of normalcy in my life.After seeing this new doctor for a few months, she asked me if I was interested in dating again (not her -- that would be weird and a tad awkward). I wasn't back then, but after a while, I got fed up with bein set up or tricked into going on a date and well, you know how lovely they've been ending up. She asked if I had ever tried any dating sites, and I hadn't. I was dead set against them. All I had heard was one horror story after another, and I still think the numbers given by Match.com and e-Harmony are as real as my hair color. But since getting frustrated with the setups, the repeated run-ins with married men, I figured maybe I should just bite the bullet and try one out. Based on my doctor's suggestion, I went on 'How About We...' and I think she's either getting a kick back from them or she's just as evil as the majority of my friends. I filled out my profile and said what I wanted, told them what I was looking for and evidently, I'm into drunk, sex-obsessed short men who have no ambition, but are baby crazy. Thanks! It's nice to see my self-esteem will be nonexistent with the help of you and your risk-free trial. First off, the guys on there seem to have a drinking problem. Either that, or they have unlimited access to roofies. Everyone wants to go binge drinking and/or try every beer at The Cambridge Brewing Company in one night. I had half a glass of Guinness last week and I'm still surprised I made it up the stairs. The kid is a cheap date -- it's one of my major selling points. So, spending the night boozing it up usually ends up with me naked and face down in bed. Now, I know I was slutty back when I weighed the same as Nissan Pathfinder, and I'd take whatever attention I could get. But I'd rather not participate in drunken surprise sex now. I had a guy call me shallow and say I turned him down because he was overweight. No, I turned you down because I can't eat my weight in Mexican food anymore. Believe me, I love a good burrito. But it takes me three days to eat one. You wanted to have a 10-course dinner AND have booze too? If I tried to do that, it would get messy, and I don't think me projectile vomiting is the first impression I want to make. Call my crazy, but I'd like to think most guys frown up on that behavior. Granted, he could have been into Roman Showers (don't act like you don't know what they are!) and I'm not judging... OK, maybe I am. But that's not what I'm into. Good day, sir!One of my 'Daily Dates' was a lab tech who seemed to be obsessed with finding a 'real girl,' which makes me think the last few ladies had some extra candy in their panties and he wasn't about to be seen with a lollipop in his mouth. He also said he had a weakness for girls who ""...are just sooo sweet!!!"" I'm just going to assume it was a group of 12 old girls who made the profile up as a goof during a slumber party. Because there is no way there's a grown-ass man who writes like that. Listen, I weep for the editors who have to read my nonsense. I know I have the grammar and spelling skills of a feral rat, but I at least make an effort to sound like an adult. Speaking of bad spelling, it's the 'Merrimack River' NOT the 'Merrimike River.' Spell check is your friend, folks. And yes, I checked, there is no 'Merrimike River'.Although, I'm sure it would be lovely if it existed. Oh, by the way, men -- please use pictures with all of your clothes on and don't have a kid in your picture that looks depressed or like it's being held against its will. Women will think you're holding the child hostage and we don't need that kind of stress in our lives. ""DATE ME OR THE KID GETS IT!"" is not the best way to open a dialogue with a lady. I know... we're so high maintenance. Oh and no, I don't want to go to your apartment and listen to records. We all know it will end with me stuck in a crawl space and forced to listen to Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass records 24 hours a day. I'm not interested in going on patrol with Buffy (ends with me stabbed with a wooden stake and stored in a crawl space) and no, I don't want to go babysitting with you (not going there).OK, maybe I'm being a tad bit negative -- there have been a few guys I've been interested in. The guy who's date idea was learning Chinese in a small village way up in the mountains of rural China gets a thumbs up based on originality alone. So, they're not all bad -- there's been a few decent guys. Now I just need to con them into being interested in me. That'll be easy, right?No, no it won't. *bangs head*"

To many, Israel represents a beacon of democracy, stability, and prosperity in the middle of a bunch of very troubled states. (Having just come from Egypt, I can certainly understand that.) Of course it's the Holy Land -- three great religions share some of Israel's most sacred spots. And that means it's the center of a complex political puzzle, and full of great travel experiences. I'm spending about a week here to scout for an upcoming TV episode and I'm in the hands of fine local guides provided by the very supportive Israel Ministry of Tourism. For the next week I'll be sharing a couple of posts a day. Please share this with your Facebook friends who may be interested. I hope you enjoy my reporting.  The Israeli coast from Tel Aviv to the border of Lebanon is dotted with interesting sights. The thriving city of Haifa is home to the main temple of the Baha'i Faith. Its founder, Baha'u'llah, is buried in Israel. Sightseers must come away from a visit to any Baha'i sight thinking: These people are the ultimate in let's all just get along, live together in peace, and tend gorgeous gardens. Signs in four languages are commonplace in Israel: Hebrew (for its Jewish population), Arabic (for the Israeli Arabs -- about a quarter of the country), Russian (as many locals are recent Jewish arrivals from the former Soviet Union, and Russian tourism is booming), and English (for everyone else). Signs that are only in Hebrew present me with more than a language barrier: I literally can't tell which end is up. Visitors to Israel come away impressed by the country's many layers of history. That includes lots of Roman ruins. The ancient city of Beit She'an -- the best Roman ruins in Israel -- marked the eastern end of the empire at its peak. In A.D. 749, the impressive city was leveled by what must have been a mighty earthquake."

""Although short-term sleeping medications can help patients, it is exceedingly important that they be carefully used and monitored,"" Pamela S. Hyde, SAMHSA Administrator, said in a statement. ""Physicians and patients need to be aware of the potential adverse reactions associated with any medication, and work closely together to prevent or quickly address any problems that may arise.""Zolpidem-linked emergency department visits increased by 274 percent for women between 2005 and 2010, and 144 percent for men. Half of the visits in 2010 were caused by taking zolpidem in addition to another kind of drug, with 37 percent of the visits involving taking zolpidem in addition to a central nervous system-depressing drug. SAMHSA reported that taking zolpidem with other drugs can be dangerous because it makes the sedative effects of the pill even more powerful. Zolpidem is FDA-approved to treat (not cure!) insomnia, but side effects include parasomnias (like sleepwalking), daytime drowsiness, hallucinations and dizziness. Earlier this year, the FDA recommended drugmakers to lower dosages of zolpidem because of the morning drowsiness effects of the drug. ""All sleep drugs have the potential to cause this, so health professionals should prescribe – and patients should take – the lowest dose that is capable of preventing insomnia,"" Dr. Ellis Unger, a director in FDA's Office of Drug Evaluation, said in a teleconference as reported by the Associated Press. Last year, a study in the journal BMJ Open showed an association between taking 18 or fewer sleeping pills a year -- particularly zolpidem in the drug temazepam (Restoril) -- and having a 3.5 times higher death risk. However, it was not clear what was responsible for this association -- if it's that the sleeping pills themselves are dangerous, that people who have insomnia to begin with have a higher death risk, or that these people may have been taking other drugs or had other conditions that would raise their death risk. HuffPost Science's Cara Santa Maria explained how zolpidem works in the brain: It works on a receptor of the brain that binds GABA (short for gamma-aminobutyric acid), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in humans. GABA quiets the nervous system, and drugs that mimic or potentiate GABA are prescribed for anxiety, as anticonvulsants, and to help people sleep, like Ambien does.For more on zolpidem and other sleeping pills, click here."

I've often marveled at how American parents teach children that anything they set their minds to is possible, and how despite the fact that American parents work longer hours than their European counterparts, they still make time to raise strong, healthy families. However, after working in England, Germany and the United States and hearing from friends who live all over the world, I've noticed a few places where modern American parents could use a bit of extra coaching. And it really is modern parenting that's at fault for most of these shortfalls -- British, American and Continental parenting styles were quite similar until a generation ago. It's time to take a steady look at what traditional American and European parents knew, but modern American parents seem to have forgotten: Here are the top five mistakes that modern American parents make. 1. Regimenting time, not behavior It's no secret American children are overscheduled, but the real problem is that American parents spend energy creating boundaries around what kids are doing, rather than how they're doing it. My last article mentioned one mum who's a perfect example of this problem. She signed her daughter up for swimming lessons and brought her on time each week, but didn't invest time in helping her cope with losses and setbacks. Learning the backstroke is great, but learning to process disappointment is infinitely more valuable.Parents in Britain sign their children up for lessons, practice and play dates, too, but they are even more focused on correcting misbehavior and encouraging success. When I was growing up in England, my parents would have been absolutely horrified by some of the behavior tolerated by Americans exhausted from shuffling kids from rehearsal to soccer practice. 2. Setting the Bar Too Low  American parents famously suffer from ""everyone gets a trophy syndrome,"" congratulating children for showing up to sporting events rather than winning and pushing grade inflation higher and higher. But this is just one facet of a larger problem: setting low expectations for children's behavior.  I can't tell you how many times I've had a parent -- usually an American one -- come to me and say that their child just can not sit properly through a meal or keep from melting down on a trip to the grocery store. Invariably, it's because the parents have come to expect a tantrum or a fight, and the child duly obliges. ""I don't know,"" they say, shaking their heads. ""Jack just can't sit at the table for that long."" When I say that he can, parents often don't believe me -- until they try it out, establish higher expectations, and watch as their child rises to the occasion. Children all over the world misbehave and make mistakes, but American parents seem peculiarly inclined to make excuses for their children's horrid behavior. A few weeks ago, I went out to supper with a friend, and the family at the table next to ours had two children who were running around and spilling salt and pepper all over the table. When one of them made a mad dash and bumped into my friend's chair, his mum came over and scooped him up. ""Sorry,"" she said, smiling, ""he missed his nap today and he's a little wired."" But she never corrected his behavior, and sure enough, five minutes later they were off again running around like maniacs.Of course, it's important to acknowledge the connection between behavior and environment, and adults must be sensitive to children's limitations. But while being tired may be a factor, it doesn't excuse poor behavior. Don't be afraid to establish expectations, and hold your children accountable.3. Being Afraid of ""No"" One of the things that most surprised me when I moved to the States was how rarely I heard parents say ""no."" When confronted with poor or even dangerous behavior, Americans do far more negotiating, pleading and tolerating than their European counterparts. ""No"" is a powerful tool, and it's high time American parents reclaimed it. It's best paired with a concise, simple explanation: ""No, you can't touch the oven, it's hot and it could burn you."" ""No, you mustn't hit your brother, because that hurts his body."" Doing this helps establish that your rules aren't arbitrary.However, don't get caught up in justifying rules to your child. I only explain once, or twice at the most. After that, if the behavior continues, I say a simple but firm no, and move them away from whatever it is. For toddlers with limited listening comprehension, follow the simple explanation with a distraction. ""No"" doesn't have to be angry, and children shouldn't automatically worry that they're in trouble. Parents often display anger when they're frustrated or frightened -- much better to go to your child, get down on his level, touch him and calmly but firmly deliver your message. Wielding a firm ""no"" is especially important for those times when you can't get to your child fast enough to prevent bad or dangerous behavior. I love using the game ""Red Light, Green Light"" to teach them to respond to No and Stop, especially where their safety is concerned. With ""red light,"" there's no explanation needed, but they know they have to stop!For more, click here to see my new video with 4 tips for using no effectively.4. Tolerating Disorderly Bedtime Along with being a nanny, I've worked as a baby sleep consultant. I've had clients all over the world, but nowhere is there more call for help with getting kids to bed than in America. Because of that, I wasn't surprised when I came across this article about how parents around the world describe their kids. Among other things, it compares American attitudes to bedtime and schedule regularity with European ones. The research and interviews with parents revealed what I'd already discovered: When faced with a fussy child at bedtime, American parents entertain, distract and placate, where Europeans enforce the schedule. The American way, of course, essentially rewards children for waking, shortsightedly giving them attention and stimulation at a time when they really need rest. When parents are driving round the block or waking up to give yet another feed or bottle, it results in poorer sleep for everyone.5. Skipping Over Manners Many American parents are shockingly lax about teaching their children good manners. I've even met parents who gave up insisting on table manners at home because they thought it was too much effort! But without consistent reinforcement, it's impossible to summon proper manners in the situations that really require them. When your child has dinner with his boss as an adult, you don't want him to be desperately trying to remember which fork to use for salad and whether his glass is on the right or left.Looking at the graphs from the Atlantic article mentioned above, we can see a clear pattern. All the top words American parents use to describe their children, like ""intelligent,"" ""independent,"" and ""rebellious,"" focus solely on the individual child, as though American children develop in vacuums. In contrast, the other countries favor descriptions that acknowledge social development and interaction, like ""easy,"" ""even-tempered,"" or even Spain's ""good character"" and ""socially mature."" And what are good manners, after all, if not a set of social skills and habits that help people get along with one another? The absence of words about manners and positive social behavior from Americans' parenting vocabulary reveals quite a bit about their priorities: American parents are more likely to care that their children are ""cognitively advanced"" than that they are polite or conscientious. Of course, not every American parent makes these mistakes, and not every British or European parent is innocent of them. But like fish in water, we can be blind to the environment around us, and take for granted bad habits ingrained in the culture. By taking a step back and looking objectively at some of our cultural assumptions, we can become better, more aware parents and caregivers."

The acaracide selected is even one that is ""Ox Pecker-friendly"" (a bird commonly found ""pecking"" rhinos looking for ticks) to ensure little or no damage to other animals and organisms sharing the rhino's habitat.

The answer is not simple.",2013-05-01,People Throwing Confetti Over a Newlywed Couple Leaving Church,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d105c2000003100fdd175.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A wedding is expensive, but is taking out a loan to cover wedding expenses a viable option for brides and grooms? Maybe yes, maybe no. The answer is not simple.According to the latest statistics, the estimated cost of a wedding in 2012 grew to more than $28,000. One way wedding couples tackle the problem of high wedding costs is to take out a wedding loan. But is that a wise wedding planning decision?As with any loan, the ability to pay it back is a priority consideration. For brides and grooms uniting two healthy incomes, a reasonable expectation of paying back the loan without extraordinary sacrifice may exist. Under such circumstances, a wedding loan can be a convenience that makes sense. Taking out the loan would allow more immediate money to produce a dream wedding without delaying the nuptials.On the other hand, if a couple is uniting two average incomes, the burden of paying back a large loan may bring unnecessary stress to a new marriage. Even worse would be a scenario in which newlyweds share a single income after marriage. A marriage loan is enticing, and amidst the excitement of wedding planning, it's easy to think only of the present. But for some couples, a wedding loan can be a devastating blow, the kind of blow that a new marriage may not survive.  Where the loan originates is also a deciding factor. It is no difficult feat to find a predatory lender who specializes in bad-credit loans for weddings or any other purpose. These lenders usually possess superior power-of-persuasion skills, and no one is more vulnerable than a bride who simply wants the wedding of her dreams. But taking out a high-interest personal loan to finance a wedding makes little sense for any bride and groom.An exception to this rule would be the existence of money in reserve to repay the loan, such as an imminent inheritance, an insurance settlement, or another guaranteed windfall sum. If there is money on the horizon that can be earmarked for loan repayment, and there is no other way to obtain a loan, a bad-credit unsecured loan could work. The interest will no doubt be very expensive, but if it means not delaying a wedding, and getting the wedding underway sooner rather than later it is important to you, it can be a choice of last resort as long as the means for quickly paying it back exists.Budgeting for a wedding is crucial in order to keep the costs in check, and a wedding budget is a great trial of how the household money will be handled after the wedding day. Learning to budget, and sticking to it, is one of life's most valuable lessons. For wedding couples it may mean choosing less of ""this"" to have more of ""that"" at the ceremony, reception or honeymoon. But in the end, adhering to the budget will be rewarding.The burden of debt is detrimental to everything from a sense of self-worth to physical health to intimate relationships. No wedding couple wants to start a marriage with staggering debt. One way to help avoid that debt is to use budgeting software.Software doesn't have to be specific to wedding planning for it to be useful to wedding couples. For instance, Quicken's ""Mint"" is a free online software program than can be adapted for personal use, wedding planning, or any other budget projects, and it's just one of many budgeting programs that can keep brides and grooms on the right track. Pricier budgeting software may provide more bells and whistles than free software, but for wedding couples, more is not always necessary.Every wedding couple is unique, and every wedding couple's finances are just as individualized. The decision of whether or not to obtain a wedding loan to cover wedding costs is personal. But it's a personal decision that benefits from a thorough examination before any action is taken. Consider these questions:• Can the loan be repaid without hardship? • Is a more expensive wedding worth the burden of the debt? • Is there a safeguard for repaying the loan in the event of a loss of income? • Do both the bride and groom agree on how wedding and marriage finances should be handled? • What desired, after-wedding item could be purchased with just the interest expense that will be forever lost to the payback of the loan?If these questions are answered honestly, it will be easier to come to a decision about utilizing a wedding loan. For some, a loan will work. For others, taking out a wedding loan may be the first horrible decision a couple makes. It probably won't be the last terrible decision made in the course of the marriage, because all of us married folks make some doozies from time to time. But it is one that can set the stage -- good or bad -- for the future.For the happiest wedding, it's a saving grace to make no debt decisions in haste. Easy financing is not always what it's cracked up to be, even for a dream wedding."
