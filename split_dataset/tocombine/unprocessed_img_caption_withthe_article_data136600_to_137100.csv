They don't believe evolution should be taught in public schools in Texas. On the other side are board members who don't want religious or political ideologies to suppress a widely accepted theory.Huffington Post Science reached out to Bill Nye to get his take on the ongoing debate, which had recently flared during a board discussion about whether to approve new science textbooks. And the ""Science Guy"" had some choice things to say.""This textbook business is, to my way of thinking, a very serious matter, because of the economic impact,"" Nye said in an email to HuffPost. ""Everyone should take a moment and think what it will mean to raise a generation of students who might believe that it is reasonable to think for a moment that the Earth might be 10,000 years old."" ""It's an outrageous notion,"" Nye continued. ""It's not a benign idea. It's inane or silly. These students will not accept the process of science, which will stifle or suppress innovation.""How so?Using a Dallas-based high-tech company as an example, Nye said the suppression of science ultimately would mean that such companies ""would not be able to find competent engineers to come up with new ideas and create new products.""""It's not a religious issue, as such. It's the future of the United States' economy that's at stake,"" Nye said. The board ultimately decided to adopt the contested textbooks, but, of course, the evolution-in-schools debate has not been limited to the Lone Star State. So what can parents across the U.S. do to make sure their kids' scientific education isn't being stunted?Vote -- every chance you get, Nye concluded. ""Make your voice heard."""

Novitas has numerous contracts with CMS, including to administer doctor and hospital claims in the federal Medicare program for elderly Americans.The problem-plagued HealthCare.gov is being worked on by contractors racing to fix it by the end of November so that people can enroll in insurance plans for 2014 under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The law aims to provide health care insurance to millions of uninsured people. OBAMA ASKED FOR FEWER 'NO-BID' CONTRACTSFederal agencies are normally required to solicit bids for work, so as to get the best deal for taxpayers, but can award a contract to a favored company in emergencies as long as they document the urgency.A few weeks after taking office in 2009, Obama issued a memorandum to government agency heads ordering them to minimize the use of non-competitive contracts, calling them potentially ""wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse.""The procurement documents made clear how crucial the financial functions on the healthcare portal are. If payments were not made on time and accurately, CMS said, ""operation of the Marketplace and the Affordable Care Act will certainly be jeopardized.""Financial management includes such functions as transmitting premium payments to insurers. Building that capability into the Obamacare marketplace ""is already minimally two months overdue,"" according to the August documents.Just a few weeks before the financial-management contract was awarded, according to emails released last week by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, CMS officials were becoming increasingly concerned about the status of the federal insurance marketplace, asking for assurance that the lead contractor was not ""going to crash the plane at take-off.""On Tuesday, CMS's deputy chief information officer, Henry Chao, author of the ""crash"" email, told a congressional panel that 30 to 40 percent of the federal marketplace was still under construction.Invisible to consumers are what Chao called the ""back office systems."" Those include accounting and payment systems to send premiums to insurers and transfer funds to insurers that attract more than their share of customers with high medical costs.The no-bid contract awarded to Novitas includes these systems. Novitas is a subsidiary of Diversified Service Options, which is wholly-owned by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida .Asked about how Novitas was awarded the contract and the work it is doing, Florida Blue spokesman Mark Wright said a company official told him, ""We're not going to be able to get into this right now.""Chao told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that CMS and its contractors had focused on building HealthCare.gov so it could launch on Oct. 1, postponing construction of ""the financial management aspects of the system.""The lead contractor on HealthCare.gov, the U.S. subsidiary of Canada's CGI Group Inc, is also involved in building the financial management piece of the marketplace, a company official said.The construction ""is a bigger problem than people realize,"" said Robert Booz, a vice-president and healthcare specialist at technology consultant Gartner.""Everyone recognizes it's going to be a problem in January,"" he said, referring to financial management. In the worst case, if financial records are wrong, then people who have signed up for, and paid a monthly premium for, insurance may be told incorrectly that they are not covered.

Today considered one of the greatest rap albums of the '90s, ""Doggystyle"" was first met with mixed reviews. That mattered not, though, because the album quickly solidified itself among the pantheon of hip-hop greatness. Then known as Snoopy Doggy Dogg, the rapper had already developed a following thanks to his contributions to Dr. Dre's 1992 classic ""The Chronic."" Upon its debut, ""Doggystyle"" made him a household name that would never be forgotten. ""I don't believe I've ever listened to the whole album and I'm being honest with you,"" Snoop Dogg told MTV News on Friday. ""I ain't never listen to 'Doggystyle' top to bottom. I may have listened to songs, but I've never listened to it.""We've certainly listened, Snoop -- time and time again. Here's a look back at the album, released Nov. 23, 1993.""Doggystyle"" debuted at No. 1 and returned to that coveted spot in January of the following year after reaching three-time platinum status. The album was certified four-times platinum in May 1994.  The first single, ""Who I Am (What's My Name?),"" peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at No. 1 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. ""What's My Name?"" introduced Snoop, but it's ""Gin and Juice"" that's become an indelible rap classic. It, too, reached No. 8 on the Hot 100. The song was nominated for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 1995 Grammy Awards but lost to Queen Latifah's ""U.N.I.T.Y.""""Doggy Dogg World"" was never released as an official single in the U.S., but it received some airplay nonetheless and won the 1994 MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video. Here's Snoop performing ""Murder was the Case"" at the 1994 VMAs. The song become the basis for a 16-minute film directed by Dr. Dre and Fab Five Freddy that depicted the rapper's fictional death. It took almost no time for Snoop to become a rap sensation. Here is he on ""The Arsenio Hall Show,"" which was considered a groundbreaking program at the time.Snoop and his compatriots were causing such a splash that MTV aired a May 1994 program called ""Gangsta Rap: An MTV News Special Report."" The 30-minute segment also featured Dr. Dre, Tupac and Eazy-E. ""Doggystyle"" remains Snoop's greatest-selling album to date. His 1996 follow-up ""Tha Doggfather"" broke from Death Row Records and did not feature nearly as much collaborative work with Dr. Dre.  Snoop remains a rap fixture today, even amid his reincarnated Snoop Lion image. ""Doggystyle"" placed at No. 64 on Billboard's end-of-the-decade '90s chart, and it was ranked among The Source magazine's list of the best rap albums of all time. Watch Snoop Lion stop by HuffPost Live to discuss his documentary, ""Reincarnated."" Oh, and see him smoke a blunt on-air, too."

GREEN PROTESTEnvironmentalists walked out on Thursday, exasperated by lack of progress. Rich nations are preoccupied with reviving their weak economies rather than climate change.""It is abundantly clear that we still have a long way to go,"" said Christiana Figueres, the U.N. climate chief.Negotiators were on course for a 2015 summit in Paris but not on track for limiting global warming to an agreed ceiling of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times to avoid dangerous change, she said.In September, the U.N. panel of climate experts raised the probability that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly from burning fossil fuels, were the main cause of warming since 1950 to 95 percent, from 90 in a previous assessment.Delegates in Warsaw agreed that a new global deal, due to be struck in Paris in 2015 and to enter into force from 2020, would be made up of what they called ""intended nationally determined contributions"" from both rich and poor nations.Until now, rich nations that have emitted most greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution have been expected to take the lead with ""commitments"" to cut emissions while the poor have been granted less stringent ""actions"".""In the old system you had this firewall between commitments and actions, now there is one word for all,"" European Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said. ""There are many ways to Paris that would be more beautiful and faster.""But developing nations said the rich still needed to lead. ""In my understanding the firewall exists and will continue to exist,"" India's Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan said.Either way, U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern said there would be no coercion. ""It is not like someone is going to stand over you with a club and tell you what to do,"" he said.The Warsaw deal called on those nations able to do so to put forward their plans for curbs on emissions by the first quarter of 2015 to give time for a review before a summit in Paris at the end of the year.Under the last climate pact, the Kyoto Protocol, only the most developed countries were required to limit their emissions - one of the main reasons the United States refused to accept it, saying rapidly growing economies like China and India should also take part.Until Saturday, the only concrete measure to have emerged in Warsaw was an agreement on new rules to protect tropical forests, which soak up carbon dioxide as they grow.Developed nations, which promised in 2009 to raise aid to $100 billion a year after 2020 from $10 billion a year in 2010-12, rejected calls to set targets for 2013-19.A draft text merely urged developed nations to set ""increasing levels"" of aid.

According to author and music historian, Robert Gordon it was also an example of unity in 1960s segregated South Memphis. In his new book, Respect Yourself: Stax Records and the Soul Explosion Gordon uses the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement to emphasize Stax's groundbreaking interracial harmony from the relationship its white founders Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton shared with African-American music executive, Al Bell to the racially mixed studio house band, Booker T. & The MGs. ""The book is very much about race,"" says Gordon. ""What was going on inside Stax was a transcendent oasis above a society that was largely acting horribly. The issue with race is can we not see it and at Stax they did not see race. So that's certainly something to look toward.""  The Memphis native read from his book this past Saturday at a signing held at the Stax Museum of American Soul Music. It was a fitting location since Gordon believes that The Soulsville Foundation, which funds and operates the museum, The Soulsville Charter School and Stax Music Academy represents the future promise of Stax. ""I think the museum, school and academy is where we are going. This is really about enriching this neighborhood and about kids. Tell me that Jim Stewart, Estelle Axton and Al Bell would not be thrilled about that,"" he says.One of the leaders helping to carry forth the legacy of Stax is Justin Merrick, vocal director/operations director of the Stax Music Academy. And now the Grammy's are taking notice. Merrick is part of a historical moment this year as one of 217 quarterfinalists for the first-ever Music Educator Award. ""The fact this platform exists is exciting because people are taking note and music education is being valued,"" says Merrick.  The Grammy's aren't the only ones recognizing the work of the Stax Music Academy. Since it's launch in 2000 the program has served more than 2,500 students and they have performed for the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Bill Clinton and Stevie Wonder. Meanwhile the Academy's sister organization, The Soulsville Charter School graduated their first class in 2012 with 100 percent of students accepted to college. Merrick believes that it's an individualized approach to education that has led to such milestones.  Merrick advises:It's not just about making students productive citizens and getting them to college. It's also about them being self-actualized where they can reach individual success that is not based on systematic approaches. That means we have to individualize per student and it takes great energy. But when they see success in that you can hold them to other levels of success in their life.Rosalind Withers is also aiming high with a Kickstarter campaign to preserve the work of her father, legendary news photographer Ernest C. Withers. His coverage of the Emmett Till murder helped ignite the Civil Rights Movement and he was there to document the entire era. Presently his work is stored above two restaurants on Beale Street in Memphis. Last month there was a fire in the area at B.B. Kings Restaurant & Blues Club. Now Ms. Withers, the trustee and CEO of the Withers Collection Museum & Gallery, wants to transport the work to a safer location to begin the digitization process of nearly one million photos and negatives. ""There is an urgency to do what needs to be done with his work to move it from where it is jeopardized. We have to do this in a way that it is protected,"" says Ms. Withers.  Thus far the campaign has raised less than 2 percent of its goal, $55,000 and has about three weeks left to go. While some are surprised there isn't greater support for the campaign due to the nature of Mr. Withers' work, others speculate that it's due to revelations in 2010 that Mr. Withers was a paid F.B.I. informer. But none of this has stopped Ms. Withers from pressing forward.  Ms. Withers says:There is some impact on people's minds in reference to those allegations. He was the source the F.B.I. came to as a journalist but the information he shared with them was no different than what he shared with the media. So they were a client just like TIME and LIFE magazine and they were probably a good paying client. I know he did not give that work away for free.

According to author and music historian, Robert Gordon it was also an example of unity in 1960s segregated South Memphis. In his new book, Respect Yourself: Stax Records and the Soul Explosion Gordon uses the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement to emphasize Stax's groundbreaking interracial harmony from the relationship its white founders Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton shared with African-American music executive, Al Bell to the racially mixed studio house band, Booker T. & The MGs. ""The book is very much about race,"" says Gordon. ""What was going on inside Stax was a transcendent oasis above a society that was largely acting horribly. The issue with race is can we not see it and at Stax they did not see race. So that's certainly something to look toward.""  The Memphis native read from his book this past Saturday at a signing held at the Stax Museum of American Soul Music. It was a fitting location since Gordon believes that The Soulsville Foundation, which funds and operates the museum, The Soulsville Charter School and Stax Music Academy represents the future promise of Stax. ""I think the museum, school and academy is where we are going. This is really about enriching this neighborhood and about kids. Tell me that Jim Stewart, Estelle Axton and Al Bell would not be thrilled about that,"" he says.One of the leaders helping to carry forth the legacy of Stax is Justin Merrick, vocal director/operations director of the Stax Music Academy. And now the Grammy's are taking notice. Merrick is part of a historical moment this year as one of 217 quarterfinalists for the first-ever Music Educator Award. ""The fact this platform exists is exciting because people are taking note and music education is being valued,"" says Merrick.  The Grammy's aren't the only ones recognizing the work of the Stax Music Academy. Since it's launch in 2000 the program has served more than 2,500 students and they have performed for the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Bill Clinton and Stevie Wonder. Meanwhile the Academy's sister organization, The Soulsville Charter School graduated their first class in 2012 with 100 percent of students accepted to college. Merrick believes that it's an individualized approach to education that has led to such milestones.  Merrick advises:It's not just about making students productive citizens and getting them to college. It's also about them being self-actualized where they can reach individual success that is not based on systematic approaches. That means we have to individualize per student and it takes great energy. But when they see success in that you can hold them to other levels of success in their life.Rosalind Withers is also aiming high with a Kickstarter campaign to preserve the work of her father, legendary news photographer Ernest C. Withers. His coverage of the Emmett Till murder helped ignite the Civil Rights Movement and he was there to document the entire era. Presently his work is stored above two restaurants on Beale Street in Memphis. Last month there was a fire in the area at B.B. Kings Restaurant & Blues Club. Now Ms. Withers, the trustee and CEO of the Withers Collection Museum & Gallery, wants to transport the work to a safer location to begin the digitization process of nearly one million photos and negatives. ""There is an urgency to do what needs to be done with his work to move it from where it is jeopardized. We have to do this in a way that it is protected,"" says Ms. Withers.  Thus far the campaign has raised less than 2 percent of its goal, $55,000 and has about three weeks left to go. While some are surprised there isn't greater support for the campaign due to the nature of Mr. Withers' work, others speculate that it's due to revelations in 2010 that Mr. Withers was a paid F.B.I. informer. But none of this has stopped Ms. Withers from pressing forward.  Ms. Withers says:There is some impact on people's minds in reference to those allegations. He was the source the F.B.I. came to as a journalist but the information he shared with them was no different than what he shared with the media. So they were a client just like TIME and LIFE magazine and they were probably a good paying client. I know he did not give that work away for free.
