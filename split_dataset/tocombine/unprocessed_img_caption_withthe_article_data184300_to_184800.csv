Jazz, Baseball, Corporate Identities and the Bomb are all as American as the proverbial apple pie.Letters from America | Corey Helford Gallery mounts a U.K. invasion with an all-American Independence Day celebration on Wednesday, July 4 at Black Rat Gallery. The exhibition transforms the London tunnel into a bunker of America's most wanted artists, showcasing new works from RISK, Ron English, SABER, and TrustoCorp.SABER's famous flag series serves as a commentary about the National Healthcare System and his personal challenges with it. For the show, SABER will unveil first Union Flag piece, titled ""The Flag Of The National Healthcare System."" ""Quite literally, I paint for my life,"" he says. ""Every painting I touch, I try to envision my pieces on a travel into the future as a record of the great emotional value as well as artistic merit that can only be matched by someone living under such extreme conditions during these tumultuous times. I only hope that after I am gone, these pieces will be hung on the walls of a different era where we as nations care more about nurturing its citizens than perpetuating the system of profit over life.""The Jazz Loft Project: W. Eugene Smith in NYC, 1957-1965 | In 1957, W. Eugene Smith, a former photographer at Life magazine, moved out of the home he shared with his wife and four children in Croton-on-Hudson, New York and moved into a dilapidated, five-story loft building at 821 Sixth Avenue in New York City's wholesale flower district. 821 Sixth Avenue was a late-night haunt of musicians, including some of the biggest names in jazz--Charles Mingus, Zoot Sims, Bill Evans, and Thelonious Monk among them--and countless fascinating, underground characters.Between 1957 and 1965 W. Eugene Smith made approximately 40,000 exposures both inside the loft building at 821 Sixth Avenue, of the nocturnal jazz scene, and of the street below as seen through his fourth-floor window. He also wired the building like a surreptitious recording studio and made 1,740 reels (4,000 hours) of stereo and mono audiotapes, capturing more than three hundred musicians, among them Roy Haynes, Sonny Rollins, Bill Evans, Roland Kirk, Alice Coltrane, Don Cherry, and Paul Bley. He also recorded legends such as pianists Eddie Costa, and Sonny Clark, drummers Ronnie Free and Edgar Bateman, saxophonist Lin Halliday, bassist Henry Grimes, and multi-instrumentalist Eddie Listengart.The Jazz Loft Project runs through October 7 at the Museum of Photographic Art (MoPA)Baseball: The All-American Game | For the first time in Los Angeles, the public will have access to the largest exhibition of baseball-related traditional folk art since the American Folk Art Museum's historic The Perfect Game: America Looks at Baseball in 2003.This exhibition will explore baseball's impact on American folk art made between the late-1800s to present day. Approximately 75 works of baseball-inspired folk art and memorabilia will be shown from the private collection of Gary Cypres, owner of one of the largest sports memorabilia collections in the world. No other sport is more ingrained within the American national consciousness than the great game of baseball. Baseball became the first organized sport in the United States in 1857. After the Civil War ended in 1865, the sport became increasingly important in uniting a population that was previously divided. As baseball's popularity grew throughout the country, its imagery emerged in all mediums of popular culture.Baseball: The All-American Game runs through September 9 at the Craft And Folk Art Museum (CAFAM)Jeff Brouws: Franchised Landscapes | As a self-described ""visual anthropologist"", Brouws recognizes that photographs exist within a socio-economic, political, or historical context. Every landscape can be read as a ""field of information"" revealing evidence of the external forces that have shaped them.From his Franchised Landscapes series, Brouws references and complements the photography of the New Topographics movement of the 1970s. In addition to studying the newly constructed suburban world, as those artists so eloquently did, Brouws explores terrain vague inner city areas and considers how racial segregation, white flight, disinvestment, corporate takeovers, outsourcing, and other factors have reciprocally shaped urban, suburban and even highway spaces. As he clearly demonstrates, The New West has become a ""non-place"" landscape comprised of big box stores and fast food chains with their glowing, corporate logos mounted atop skyscraper-high poles. The poet Gary Snyder referred to these signs as ""...skinny wildweed flowers sticking up...in the asphalt riparian zone."" Brouws creates single images and diptychs, as well as typologies such as his Signs Without Signification--portraits of light-box signs from once thriving, but now abandoned businesses that reveal Capitalism's cyclical nature and it tendencies toward ""creative destruction.""Jeff Brouws closes July 14 at Craig Krull GalleryDeitrich Wegner | Every society accumulates contradictions amidst their ideals. Dietrich Wegner employs those contradictions, situating opposites together in sculpture and photography that feed on the friction between two conflicting ideas. When an image stands in limbo, between associations, it occupies a flexible place in our mind. Wegner creates images that are safe and unsettling, abject and beautiful. Some of his work shows us how a mushroom cloud can resemble a tree house, an anus a vortex, a suicide bomber a vulnerable human being, all in an effort to explore our varied states of contentment and security. In other works, such as in Cumulous Brand, babies are covered in multicolored tattoos in a meditation on how our identities evolve and how we declare them.Deitrich Wegner closes July 21 at Robert Berman GalleryFor the most comprehensive calendar of art events throughout Los Angeles go to Artweek.LA."

Of course, there's fragrance's lightweight summer-appropriate cousin -- the splash -- but there are also a handful of other breezy scent options (and a few workarounds) we're employing this summer to maintain that fine line of smelling good but not causing everyone in the elevator to faint. Keep these five guidelines in mind when buying your next summer perfume, then check out ten of our favorite blends in the gallery below. Less (ingredients) is more: Avoid complex blends, which will just overpower and transform after a couple hours. A few isolated citrus notes, like crisp pink grapefruit, mandarin and lime, will feel fresh and summer-specific. And, perhaps most importantly, will continue to smell that way throughout the day and into the night. Consider floral water: The lightest of the lightweights, this barely-there essence is incredible appealing. Further appealing is floral water's many varied uses: spritz it on as a balancing face tonic, linen refresher or a light touch in bath water. Switch up your spray formulations for a solid or roll-on perfume: If you still want to wear a bolder scent, a little bit on your wrists and neck will diffuse the heaviness that comes along with a traditional spray perfume. Look for oil-based perfumes or pure essential oils: While a little goes a long way with oil-based fragrances, these do wonderful things when skin starts to warm up. Some of our favorite essential oils are jasmine, neroli, orange blossom and lily of the valley. Look for them in perfume form or pure essential oils. And, please, keep in mind that a little dab will do ya. Heavier scents work better in the evening: They're moodier, and therefore feel more appropriate for nighttime. We love green, earthy scents like fig, sage, rhubarb, and even certains woods, which are bold but are still warm weather-appropriate.In other fragrance news, check out Kristen Stewart's new Balenciaga perfume ad.

2,WELLNESS,Coffee Skin Cancer: Caffeine Consumption Linked With Lower Risk Of Basal Cell Carcinoma,Amanda L. Chan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/coffee-skin-cancer-caffeine-basal-cell-carcinoma_us_5b9bf16be4b03a1dcc7b4640,"The Cancer Research study included analysis of 112,897 people who were in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals",2012-07-03,"Coffee (Or At Least, The Caffeine!) Can Help You Proofread Better ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ca3f4d170000b70056734e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"In addition to this finding, this finding, this finding and this finding -- all of which came out in the past month or so -- a new coffee study is showing us yet another health benefit of being a regular brew-drinker.Researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School have found that there seems to be a relationship between increased coffee intake (meaning the more, the better) and decreased risk of basal cell carcinoma -- the most common skin cancer. But researchers cautioned that if you aren't an avid coffee drinker already, this study shouldn't convince you to try to increase your coffee intake for the sake of protecting against skin cancer. ""However, our results add basal cell carcinoma to a list of conditions for which risk is decreased with increasing coffee consumption,"" study researcher Jiali Han, Ph.D., an associate professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School in Boston and Harvard School of Public Health, said in a statement. ""This list includes conditions with serious negative health consequences such as Type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease.""This year in the United States, there are expected to be more than 2,000,000 new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute. The Cancer Research study included analysis of 112,897 people who were in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Over a 20-year period, 22,786 people developed basal cell carcinoma. Researchers not only found a link between increased coffee consumption and decreased skin cancer risk -- for example, women who drank three or more cups of coffee a day had a lower risk of skin cancer than people who drank less than a cup of coffee a month -- but also a link between overall increased caffeine consumption (like from coffee, soda, chocolate and tea) and decreased skin cancer risk. Meanwhile, there was no link between decaffeinated coffee consumption and risk of the skin cancer. In addition, there was no link was identified between increased coffee or caffeine consumption and squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, which are two other kinds of skin cancer. ""These results really suggest that it is the caffeine in coffee that is responsible for the decreased risk of basal cell carcinoma associated with increasing coffee consumption,"" Han said in the statement. ""This would be consistent with published mouse data, which indicate caffeine can block skin tumor formation. However, more studies in different population cohorts and additional mechanistic studies will be needed before we can say this definitively.""However, there is such a thing as too much caffeine. The Mayo Clinic says that consuming heavy amounts of caffeine each day (500 to 600 milligrams a day, or more) can lead to muscle tremors, insomnia, irritability, restlessness and even upset stomach. But the Mayo Clinic did note that getting about 200 to 300 milligrams of caffeine per day -- that which is in about four cups of coffee -- for adults is not a detriment to health. Recently, a study of about 200,000 people in the journal CANCER showed that there may be a link between taking anti-inflammatory drugs and skin cancer risk. Researchers from the Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark found that people in the study with more than two NSAID prescriptions had a 15 percent lower risk for squamous cell carcinoma, a kind of skin cancer, as well as a 13 percent lower risk for malignant melanoma, a deadly form of the cancer. This is compared with people who only filled two or fewer NSAID prescriptions.The decreased skin cancer risk was especially pronounced when the people took them for at least seven years, and with ""high-intensity use,"" researchers said in the study.For more on the potential health benefits of coffee, click through the slideshow:"
