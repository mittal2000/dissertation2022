'Tis I! The blushing bride-to-be. I heard you had a smidge of trouble interpreting the 35-page PowerPoint presentation of my wedding table vision that I overnighted to you. Personally, I'm confused by your confusion, but I'm guessing it had something to do with my Louis XIV-meets-great-plains-of-Nebraska table theme? I told you my mother (DNA testing to prove motherhood pending) is forcing me to get married there, right? You still don't understand how 17th century imperial France could blend seamlessly with the Husker State? I see. Well, let me explain.The first thing you need to imagine is that the table is an enchanted forest come to life with over one thousand white flowers, billowing blades of wheat -- we'll need custom ceiling fans for that -- cornmeal shaped into Pawnee and Lakota tribal patterns and a few artfully placed wooden birds carved from local Silver Maples. I want it to feel organic and relaxed, but not be organic or relaxed. Okay, so that's the Nebraska influence, but on another level, the table is also home to the beguiling opulence of the Ancien Régime. The often imitated but never duplicated Sun King. I'm thinking footmen. Wigs. The higher the hair, the closer to Martha. We'll need the requisite thirty dishes served at dinner. Royal ballotine of pheasant -- because of the Bourbons' passion for the hunt -- stuffed duck à la Villeroy, a morel soufflé wrapped in heavy gold leaf, edible candles in towering silver candelabras and more fruit than a newbie vegan could eat in a month. The utensils for this feast have to be antique silver and we'll need some odd tiny forks that no one knows what to do with. The napkins, one hundred percent pure linen and folded to resemble a small French shoe. As for the menus, they'll be calligraphed by a one-eyed man I found on Etsy. Buy three get one free! The paper will be letterpressed an inch thick and the exact color of Louis XIV's eyes. Should we have them hand delivered by doves to each guest? Or, I guess that would be foot delivered? I love that, actually. Let's add that. Ah, doesn't it flow together effortlessly! No? Still, no? Hmm, how can I phrase it differently? Okay, imagine you're an exotic yellow ladybug. A French ladybug. Mademoiselle le bug. And you're crawling around in an enchanted forest with gorgeous lights and brush and flowers. There is also cutlery! Picture the forks and knives as tiny silver logs. And so much champagne. Which is just an added bonus. As for the actual table, it has to be one long mahogany table, but slightly serpentine and able to seat three hundred. Remember -- wait shouldn't you be writing this down? Here, use this India ink and ostrich quill I brought. Where was I? Yes, the guest list. Aunt Jenny cannot sit next to Cousin Millicent, that husband-swapping incident of 2006 still burns bright in family history. And please keep my college friend Michael away from hedge fund manager A, and hedge fund manager B for that matter. I don't need any cyber crimes committed during my father's toast. And on to that, since my father and I are estranged, I'm having him played by a man who did an amazing King Lear at the Globe Theatre last summer. I found him on WeddingWire! A solid five-star rating and a discount for weddings between November and March. Oh, did I mention that all of my bridesmaids are celiacs? If I see one breadcrumb on their plates I swear I will commit seppuku with my bouquet. Wait! No, don't walk away; we're only on page five!What was that? How will I pay for all this? Well, I'm thinking of selling an egg to a wonderful couple in California and my offer of one good young kidney is getting a lot of hits on that organ trafficking website in Moldova. Don't worry, I'll have the money!"

I received more than 30 photos in about 2 hours. These women gave me permission to share their gorgeous, round, fluffy and fat pictures here on the Huffington Post and all over Facebook.Sadly, in this day and age of mean, hate filled trolls who seem to have nothing better to do then sit behind a computer and comment anonymously about a total strangers weight, fitness level and health. These amazing women shared their scantily clad photos knowing full well that some of you are going to write some seriously mean crap here about their pictures -- and they are o.k. with that.

However, their first years of life have included almost daily seizures and a parade of medications to control the epilepsy. Moore has watched her twins take medicine that can be addictive, medicine that can be toxic, medicine that can cause blindness.And no matter what they try, the seizures are able to break through the medication, Moore said.However, a CNN report that mentioned marijuana's potential for calming seizures in children gave her hope that better treatments were possible. The only problem: There is no legal way for her to get medical marijuana in Maryland.During this session of the Maryland General Assembly, Moore said she is lobbying for change so that, perhaps, her twins will have the chance to try the treatment.Now, she is making her case through email and phone calls from a room in Children's National Medical Center; her two sons are recovering from a feeding tube surgery that became necessary because seizures have diminished their appetites and made it difficult for them to swallow.With numerous marijuana-related bills on the horizon this session, Moore has teamed up with former Frederick Alderwoman Karen Young and Delegate Patrick Hogan to highlight the substance's potential benefit to children with epilepsy.""I know it's a controversial issue, but at the same time, if it's something that can help her kids, then I feel like it's worth doing,"" said Hogan, R-District 3A.Twenty states and Washington, D.C., currently allow medical marijuana. Of those, only two states bar minors from receiving the treatment, said a spokesman for the organization Americans for Safe Access.Young said she has reached out primarily to Senate lawmakers on Moore's behalf. Hogan says he has spoken with Delegate Dan Morhaim, a physician and leading advocate for permitting medical marijuana. This session, Morhaim, D-Baltimore County, said he plans to sponsor a proposal that could enable children with epilepsy to receive the treatment.Last year, Maryland passed a bill that would give patients access marijuana through academic medical centers. But so far, none of the academic institutions has taken advantage of the new law, so there is still no legal pathway to marijuana-based treatment.Morhaim said his new proposal would also allow Maryland physicians on staff at a hospital or hospice to recommend medical marijuana for patients with certain conditions. The bill will likely get introduced in the Legislature next week, he said.He noted that marijuana is less dangerous than many other drugs he prescribes every day, such as blood pressure, diabetes and pain medicines.""In fact, there are medicines you can get over the counter that can have potentially more serious side effects than marijuana,"" he said.Delegate Michael Hough said he hasn't seen Morhaim's proposal and doesn't want to comment on it. However, he has opposed other medical marijuana bills out of concern that easing up on medicinal uses could lead to full-blown legalization. At a time when Frederick County is struggling through a drug abuse epidemic, lawmakers need to take a tough stand on marijuana, he said.""I want to make sure I have our law enforcement's back when they're trying to fight against these drug dealers,"" said Hough, R-District 3B.Moore said she used to think ""medical marijuana is a joke,"" but she has completely reversed her opinion. While the substance likely wouldn't take away her sons' seizures, she said it might perform as well as their current medications, but without some of the harmful side effects.""In all likelihood, it wouldn't mean life or death, but it could mean that they would be healthier and happier for longer,"" she said.

A new anti-smoking proposal would make New York the first city in the nation to keep tobacco products out of sight in retail stores. Mayor Michael Bloomberg says the goal is to reduce the youth smoking rate. The legislation would require stores to keep tobacco products in cabinets, drawers, under the counter, behind a curtain or in another concealed spot. They could only be visible when an adult is making a purchase or during restocking. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dcf172200003000d9c5a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By David IngramWASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. consumers will likely have to wait until 2015 or later to see a court-ordered advertising blitz detailing tobacco companies' deception, a lag of nine years after the original ruling, a court heard on Wednesday.Tobacco lawyers said at the hearing in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., that they planned to push forward with an appeal about the wording of the ads, even after they struck an agreement this month with the Justice Department and anti-smoking advocates about what the ad campaign would look like in newspapers and on television.The companies have fought the lawsuit since President Bill Clinton's Justice Department filed it in 1999, alleging the cigarette makers engaged in racketeering by hiding from the public the health consequences of tobacco use.They lost the lawsuit and an appeal, and they were ordered to place the ads, known legally as corrective statements. U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler said Wednesday the latest appeal would likely delay the ads until 2015 or later.""I'm of course concerned about the delays,"" Kessler told lawyers at the hearing. ""The bottom line is the public is not getting what I would consider to be the benefit of the corrective statements.""Defendants Altria Group Inc, Lorillard Inc and Reynolds American Inc argue that the proposed wording of the ads would violate their free speech rights.One of the proposed ads begins: ""A federal court has ruled that the defendant tobacco companies deliberately deceived the American public by falsely selling and advertising low tar and light cigarettes as less harmful than regular cigarettes.""Kessler ruled for the government in August 2006. It has since taken more time to implement her ruling than it did to hold a trial and issue a judgment. NEXT: LOGISTICSThe next step is for Kessler to approve the logistics of the proposed ad blitz. The sides agreed this month the campaign would include a year's worth of network TV advertisements in prime time, weeks of newspaper ads and more than a decade of declarations on tobacco company websites. The agreement even goes into details such as font and type size.Once Kessler approves, a federal appeals court in Washington is expected to take up the speech question and rule perhaps in 2015, according to an estimate Kessler made in court.""It will take some time, your honor, but I think that reflects the weightiness of the issues at stake,"" Noel Francisco, a partner at the law firm Jones Day who represents Reynolds American, told the judge.A further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court by whoever loses on the speech question ""seems entirely possible,"" Justice Department lawyer Daniel Crane-Hirsch said.Kessler said in 2012 that the ad campaign would not violate the companies' speech rights because the wording is factual and not controversial.Crane-Hirsch and tobacco lawyers warned Kessler the process could take even longer if she were to modify the logistics of the ad campaign that they have hammered out. Fox Broadcasting Co and the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, for example, have filed court papers asking that some of the ads go on their networks.Separately, the sides are still arguing over how tobacco companies should change their advertising at points of sale.Howard Crystal, a lawyer who represents anti-smoking advocates as part of the lawsuit, urged Kessler to move quickly. ""We'd like to get finality,"" he said.Early in the long-running case, the Justice Department hoped to extract $280 billion from the companies to pay for a smoking cessation program and other remedies.It later dropped the demand to $14 billion, and then Kessler ruled she could not force them to pay for such a program at all.The case is USA v. Philip Morris USA, et al, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 99-cv-02496."

In addition to participating in meditation exercises, attendees heard from medical researchers on the life-changing benefits of the practice, including its ability to promote better pain tolerance, immunity to influenza and self-control in children.Hawn has been speaking out about mindfulness for more than 10 years and started her foundation, The Hawn Foundation, to help introduce the practice to children in the classroom. She told the forum's audience that in order to create a more sustainable, unified society, schools should introduce the concepts of meditation to children at a young age. ""We have to create equanimity, we have to listen to each other. We have to care deeply, collectively, about our society as a whole, otherwise we will create a world not worth living in,"" Hawn said.Hawn's mindfulness panel is one of 25 sessions at the Davos conference that will focus on well-being, mental health and the effects of technology on the brain, demonstrating the growing role of stress management as a tool of success in the business world.Practicing meditation has been proven to reduce stress levels in businesses and classrooms, contribute to positive changes in cognitive function and may even improve heart health. And many business leaders, even prior to this year's World Economic Forum, have already acknowledged the role of a mindfulness practice in their careers and lives: LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey and Starfish chairman and broadcast journalist Soledad O'Brien have all spoken publicly about how meditation has kept their stress levels low and even led to game-changing innovation and better decision-making skills.In a World Economic Forum blog about the benefits of mindfulness, the actress addressed the crucial reasons why the practice is needed among the business elite -- and the prominent impact it can have on society.""Many of the world’s top business leaders, from Arianna Huffington and Rupert Murdoch to Ford Motor Company Chairman Bill Ford and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, credit mindfulness in the workplace as part of their success,"" Hawn wrote. ""The ability to remain calm and focused in stressful situations is central to making positive decisions... I firmly believe that by cultivating mindful change and raising awareness, we can ultimately transform our world for the better.""On a larger scale, reducing stress improves the bottom line along with employee well-being: Mental health-related illnesses have the potential to cost $16 trillion in lost worker output over the next 20 years, according to figures released by Harvard University and the WEF."

Sederer, M.D.Two weeks after he had been elected Pope, on Holy Thursday, Francis knelt on his knees and washed and kissed the feet of 12 imprisoned juvenile delinquents, two being Muslim and two being women. This was yet another remarkable departure for Time magazine's ""Person of the Year"" since the papal convention has been a re-enactment of what Jesus did with the apostles but with 12 priests at a ceremony held at St. Peter's or another grand Roman church. When one of the youth asked why, Pope Francis answered: ""Things from the heart don't have an explanation.""This also was the man, a Jesuit scholar, who at 76 replied to a query about gay priests with five words that rocked the world: ""Who am I to judge?"" This was the man who leaped into his papacy by turning away from the Church's long-standing disapproval of being gay by offering, in effect, the Gospel message ""He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone... "" (John 8:7). Pope Francis opened his arms and that of the Catholic Church to people regardless of their faith, gender, sexual preferences or past behaviors. This man, this new Pope, welcomed everyone. He was relentlessly positive and compared the Church to a field hospital during war, which when faced with ""a seriously injured person... you have to heal his wounds.""The Pope's message, which I take as a Jew, is non-sectarian. As a psychiatrist, I think his message resonates with what is becoming a prevailing ethos of good mental health care -- a belief that everyone has promise, can recover and rebuild from life's misfortunes and should be able to have what we all want, namely the warmth of relationships, the safety of home, the experience of community and the dignity of being able to contribute to society.Stigma against people with mental disorders has been around even longer than the Catholic Church. Blame for being ill or behaving oddly has accompanied that stigma. As a young doctor, I was taught to forecast to young people with a serious mental illness (and their families), like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic conditions, that they never could achieve lasting relationships or success in a career. It was a message to those ill that they should resign themselves to a bleak life and a fate that could not be countered. It was, as well, a clinical stance that, ironically, kept good clinicians from providing what may be more important than anything else -- fostering hope and helping to heal the wounds of illness.Francis' message is clear: as people and institutions, we need to be welcoming (not judging); not defer to the dogma of powerful, hierarchical authorities (""Excessive centralization... complicates,"" he said); serve those in need (the wounded); and practice what we preach. This is more and more the lesson taking off in my field as well, where a powerful concept of recovery is spreading. Recovery means sustaining hope, inclusion, finding strengths, building resilience and valuing, most of all, the patient's needs and wishes first -- not the convenience of practitioners or organizations, nor the mandates of received teachings or hallowed theories. Recovery does not deny illness. That would not help either. Recovery is about making a life despite limitations, which seems to have far greater application than just to those with mental and addictive disorders.Few people have the extraordinary privilege, and responsibility, of occupying the world's stage. The new Pope has riveted the attention not just of 1.2 billion Catholics, globally. He is speaking to us all. He has gotten our attention. The leadership he is exercising in his papacy dares not to miss so rare and important an opportunity. The reception he is getting, not just from Catholics, speaks to how much his message is one we have been waiting to hear. ...........Dr. Sederer's new book for families who have a member with a mental illness is The Family Guide to Mental Health Care (Foreword by Glenn Close). www.askdrlloyd.com The opinions expressed here are solely my own.

I will never understand why China's economy is so strong while millions of its people live with so little. Seeing such stark contrast is something I did not dream of in college. A year ago, I was writing my senior thesis for my BA and could never have guessed I'd be teaching English in China in just one year. Several people have called me ""brave"" -- but I'm not brave, I just took a professor's advice seriously -- go teach in China, he said. So I did.If you are fresh out of college and completely lost, this is the time to have adventures. A bachelor's degree is not an adventure -- although college might have been your craziest years -- for most grads, a BA (or BS, or whatever it was) is really a big fat question mark. ""Well, college was fun. Now what?""Three months ago I arrived in eastern China to teach ESL through Ameson Educational and Cultural Exchange Foundation's Year in China program. Ameson placed me in Jiangyin, China, a ""small town"" of about 1.3 million people hugging the Yangtze River just north of Shanghai. I've realized life here is inexplicable -- you have to experience it for yourself. I think people travel in search of answers; if you go somewhere really far away, and look back at your life, maybe you'll see things more clearly. That hasn't exactly happened to me yet. I haven't had any a-ha! moments, or times when everything suddenly makes sense, and traveling is definitely not always glamorous (i.e., China's public bathrooms), but I have felt the tiny kicks in a friend's enormous pregnant belly. I have learned to make dumplings with a friend's grandparents. I have even danced around like a turkey for kindergarten classes. Every memorable moment I've had in China is because I did something unexpected -- I said ""yes"" to an invitation; I listened to somebody when they need to talk; I took a chance and did something crazy. Whether you quit your first job, or move across the country, or even, fall in love, not planning is the greatest thing you can do for yourself because it lets your imagination run wild. If you have everything figured out at 24-years-old, there is something terribly wrong with you. Most of the time, I feel more lost than I ever have. I have more questions and less answers and I'll be honest -- it scares the hell out of me. It is okay not to know where you will be in five years, or even in a month -- that's life. Not knowing makes people do crazy things (like move to China), but, if you can stick out the chaos long enough, eventually, things begin to look familiar again and that question mark of a degree will look less threatening. Even if you have to take a detour from your grand plan, when the dust does clear, you probably won't feel as lost."
