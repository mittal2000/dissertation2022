Now before you unleash a barrage of nasty criticism in the comment box, just hear me out.Barney's has come under fire because of two incidents of racial profiling that recently came to light. Back in April, 19-year-old Trayon Christian went to the highend retailer's Madison Avenue flagship store to purchase a $349 Ferragamo belt. After making his purchase with his Chase Bank debit card, the New York City College of Technology student was stopped by two undercover NYPD detectives a block from the store. In an interview with the NY Daily News, Trayon said the detectives told him they had stopped him because someone at the store reported his debit card as a fake. The detectives then peppered him with questions like ""How could you afford a belt like this?"" and ""Where did you get this money from?"" Despite showing the cops two forms of identification (a school ID and driver's license), Trayon was handcufffed and taken to a precinct stationhouse where he was detained for two hours, according to the discrimination lawsuit he filed against Barneys and the New York City Police Department last week.Brooklyn resident Kayla Phillips had a similar experience at Barney's in February when she splurged on a $2,500 Celine purse with money she received from a tax return. Having just opened an account with Bank of America, Kayla used a temporary card given to her by the bank to make the purchase. After leaving the store with the designer bag, she was confronted and grilled at a subway station by multiple undercover police officers who wanted to know how she could afford the bag and why she paid using a card that didn't have her name on it. At some point during their exchange, Kayla presented the officers with her official debit card and a letter stating that she had not yet activated it. Kayla plans to sue the NYPD because of the incident, and has already filed a $5 million notice of claim informing the city of her intent.Not surprisingly, these two controversial events have attracted the attention of community acitivists and civil rights groups, including Al Sharpton's National Action Network (NAN). Rachel Noerdlinger, a representative for NAN, said in a statement, ""National Action Network will immediately demand a meeting with the Barneys New York CEO."" The organization plans on picketing the store if ""the pattern of racial profiling is not immediately rectified.""As for Jay Z's role in this saga, the hip-hop mega-mogul has a deal with Barney's to introduce a collection called ""A New York Holiday"". According to the company's website, Barney's and Jay Z ""have partnered with some of the most prestigious fashion houses in the world--Balenciaga, Balmain, Lanvin, The Elder Statesman, En Noir, Hoorsenbuhs, Just Don (coming soon!), Proenza Schouler, Rick Owens, Stutterheim, Acne Studios, and Cutler & Gross--to create exclusive, limited edition products inspired by New York City."" In the wake of the racial profiling incidents, an online petition has been created to convince the Brooklyn native to terminate his relationship with the retailer, and many have called for Jay Z to back out of the deal. I disagree.Where some see this as an opportunity to use Jay Z to punish Barney's, I view this as an opportunity to utilize Jay Z's relationship with Barney's to bring about change at the highest lever at the storied retailer. Having him in the corner suite where day-to-day decisions are made is far more effective than his dropping out of the deal. He has the potential to be an informed and articulate spokesperson on how destructive it is for a company like Barney's to engage in such racially laden behavior. The platform of his massive fame allows him to influence the higher ups at Barney's to do better. You can injure Barney's in the short term by boycotting and refusing to shop there, but the most effective way to have a long term influence is through education. The overall idea is to use his power to educate. Picketing attracts attention and may make Barney's lose a couple of zeroes in their bottom line, but a more thoughtful and strategic way of combatting this type of ignorance is through education and understanding. Jay Z is uniquely situated to accomplish both. The significance of working on the inside versus shouting on the outside cannot be underestimated.In the days since this controversy emerged, Barney's has issued a press release stressing their zero tolerance policy on discrimination and stating that they will review their ""practices and procedures as they relate to these matters to ensure that they reflect our continued commitment to fairness and equality."" To that end, the company will work closely with civil rights expert, Michael Yaki, and the National Action Network. Over the weekend, Jay Z released his own statement about the racial brouhaha. In the carefully worded statement posted on his website, Jay Z takes issue with his being criticized for not immediately speaking out and terminating his relationship with Barney's. He concludes his statement by expressing his hope that this controversy brings forth a dialogue to effect real change. It is up to Jay Z himself to now recognize the role that he can play by using his platform and leverage with Barney's to effectuate that dialogue."

On Saturday, Sebelius praised the hub's ability to perform complex calculations in quick time as an example of a successful segment of the system.HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said Sebelius spoke with Verizon's chief executive officer on Sunday afternoon to discuss the situation: ""They committed to fixing the problem as soon as possible.""The outage was affecting enrollment in all 50 states, as well as Terremark customers not connected with the marketplaces, according to the HHS spokeswoman. She said the data center's network connectivity went down during planned maintenance to replace a failed networking component.A spokesman for Verizon said the problem would be fixed ""as soon as possible.""""Our engineers have been working with HHS and other technology companies to identify and address the root cause of the issue,"" Verizon spokesman Jeff Nelson said.The administration has expressed confidence it can fix underlying problems with Healthcare.gov by early December, in time for people to meet a Dec. 15 deadline to enroll in new health plans to receive benefits on Jan. 1. Further delays would jeopardize its ability to enroll as many as 7 million Americans for coverage during Obamacare's first year.Sebelius, who faces Republican calls for her resignation, will be grilled about her role in the Obamacare rollout on Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Contractors have already blamed the administration for not conducting enough vital system-wide testing and for a last-minute design change requiring online visitors to set up accounts before window-shopping for insurance. The change is widely blamed for creating early bottlenecks as millions of people flooded the website.Health officials in Connecticut, one of the 14 states that constructed their own marketplaces, were the first to report on Sunday that potential customers would not be able to complete the sign-up process for some services but could create accounts and search for pricing comparisons.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the HHS agency responsible for the federal system, told Connecticut officials about the outage and gave no indication of when the data services hub would be functioning again, said a spokeswoman for Access Health CT, the Connecticut exchange."

The magistrate instead threw out the child's birth name and ordered the boy renamed Martin DeShawn McCullough.""The word 'messiah' is a title, and it's a title that has only been earned by one person, and that one person is Jesus Christ,"" the magistrate told Tennessee television station WBIR at the time.The parents appealed, and in September another judge, Chancellor Telford Forgety Jr., held that Ballew's ruling was unconstitutional.The parents, who have since dropped their dispute over the last name, have continued to call the boy Messiah DeShawn McCullough.A three-member investigative panel of the Tennessee Board of Judicial Conduct concluded this week there was ""reasonable cause to believe (Ballew) has committed judicial offenses,"" and directed the state board's disciplinary counsel to file the charges, according to a document obtained from a court clerk.The judicial code the panel cited centers on a clause that says religion and other personal biases must not play roles when judges are performing their duties.Ballew could not be reached for comment.Ballew has 30 days to file an answer with the court, at which time a hearing will be scheduled ""to impose just and proper sanctions as provided by law,"" according to the document outlining the charges against the judge.Messiah was the 387th most popular name for boys born in the United States in 2012, based on applications for Social Security cards filed with the U.S. Social Security Administration.In all, there were 762 applications for boys named Messiah in 2012, more than double the 368 applications made in 2011, the Social Security Administration said.

There'll be fun, sexy Halloween parties all over the U.S. starting this Saturday October 26th and of course on the actual day of Halloween, Thursday October 31st.  According for Forbes.com one of the reasons Halloween is so popular with adults is ""there's the fantasy, role-play element"" to it. At least six million adults will dress as witches and 3.2 million as vampires for Halloween. Of course topless witch costumes are popular with or without pasties and the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine even featured naked vampires.   Halloween is the one time of the year where adults become more daring and baring at parties. Last year, for instance, Lady Gaga went to a Halloween party dressed just as a topless mermaid.   The Daily Beast website reports this year's pop culture sexiest and most daring costume choice will be a Miley Cyrus naked wrecking ball costume. Just wear your birthday suit with a big grey spray painted ball and chain.  Where do you go to be your barest? The American Association for Nude Recreation lists over 260 nudist resorts and clubs all across the U.S. and Canada. Most are having nude Halloween costume parties. Many are in warm weather locations, like The Terra Cotta Inn clothing optional resort, located in sunny Palm Springs, California, and Cypress Cove, located in Kissimmee, Florida. At these resorts just body paint and a smile are always fun costume choices. And first timers are always welcome at Halloween or any time of the year.  Fantasy Fest in Key West, Florida is another fun destination to show off your sexiest and barest costume.  For the prudes out there that aren't into sexy costumes, here are five popular, non-sexy Halloween destinations:  1) Knotts Berry Farms, Buena Park, California  2) Salem, Massachusetts   3) New Orleans  4 Sleepy Hallow, New York  5) Orlando, Florida with Disney World's ""Mickey's Not-so-Scary Halloween Party,"" SeaWorld's ""Shamu's Halloween Spooktacular,"" the Central Florida Zoo's ""Zoo Boo Bash,"" and ""Halloween Horror Nights."""
