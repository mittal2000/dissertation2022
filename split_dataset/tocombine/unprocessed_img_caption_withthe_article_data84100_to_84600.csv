0,POLITICS,Obama Fears Nuclear Failure While Iran Seeks Political Opprtunism,"Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, ContributorPresident of the International American Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-fears-nuclear-failu_b_7777548.html,"When we analyze the negotiations and terms comprehensively, it becomes evident that the current terms being negotiated will not only keep Iran's nuclear infrastructure and threat primarily intact, but it will create a whole new regional security dilemma, geopolitical concerns, and nuclear arms race in the region.",2015-07-11,"President Barack Obama pauses while speaking after receiving an update from military leaders on the campaign against the Islamic State, during a rare visit to the Pentagon on Monday, July 6, 2015. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb905bc220000bb01dd893b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Iranian Leaders Want the Deal Both WaysOne of the lengthiest diplomatic negotiations, the Iranian Nuclear Deal, seems to be never-ending. Two deadlines have already been missed in the last month. In addition, the negotiators missed the target of Washington time set by the U.S. Congress. This would grant the Congress two months instead of 30 days to review any agreement. Nevertheless, it is crucial to point out that extensions or missing deadlines do not necessarily scuttle the nuclear talks or mean that the negotiations will fall apart. With Russia and China being on the side of Tehran, the Islamic Republic's attempts to obtain more concessions from the United States, France, and Germany are on the rise. After almost two years of negotiations and meetings, the motive to reach a final nuclear deal has also intensified for Obama administration. While at the beginning of the talks, President Obama might have been searching for a lifetime legacy in the Middle East by sealing a nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic, currently another reason is pushing the talks -- the President's fear of his credibility being damaged if a deal is not reached.President Obama is cognizant of the fact that not reaching a nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic would be a strong blow to him and the democratic party due to the considerable amount of political capital that has been spent on these marathon talks.As a result, diplomacy is being played in order to keep dragging the nuclear talks into a seemingly never-ending process. In addition, Iranian leaders are good at this and at obtaining more points to their advantage at final stages. It appears that Iranian leaders want the deal both ways. The Barrier: Iran Demands More -- Lifting of the Arms EmbargoIn the 11th hour, Iran has added another demand to the table: lifting the arms embargo on Iran as part of the UN sanctions against the Islamic Republic.The issue is that if the arms embargo is lifted, it will have severe repercussions on ratcheting up the conflict in Iraq and Syria, as Iran can gain access to more advanced weapons. Iran's demand in the final hours indicates that Iranian leaders are very skillful at diplomacy and realize President Obama's weakness and desperation to seal a deal.In addition, the Iranian negotiating team is capitalizing on the split in their opponent's teams as Russia and China are on the Iranian side when it comes to lifting the arms embargo. Iranian leaders will attempt to obtain the optimum amount of concessions without rushing to seal a deal.With the lifting of the arms embargo, the deal will be much sweeter for the Iranians. Iranian leaders will have it both ways. After 10 years , if Iran did not cheat and if the ruling clerics honored their commitments (which the Islamic Republic does not have a good record of doing so), Iran's nuclear break-out capacity will shrink to zero, meaning Iran will be a nuclear power. Secondly, Iran will gain more advanced weaponry, the IRGC will solidify its economic power, and the government will receive billions of dollars. Another issue is that, even if the six world powers and the Islamic Republic reach a ""final"" nuclear deal, the deal is not going to be final. Apparently, both sides will not be signing the final agreement until a few months later. First, the U.S. Congress and Iranian domestic counterparts will review the agreement. Then, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will have to inspect Iran's nuclear activities and verify the compliance with the article of the agreement. Finally, after the IAEA verified compliance, sanctions will be lifted and both sides will sign the deal.This method also appears to be a solution not to discredit Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's redline. Khamenei previously demanded that all sanctions should be lifted upon the signing of the final agreement. While in international diplomacy, deals are first signed and then implemented, the six world powers and the Islamic Republic are reversing the process.If a Deal Reached: Will It Be a Good Deal? Who Will Be the Winner?Another crucial and lingering question is whether the potential deal will a good one, and who will be the primary winner or losers. The response to such questions depends on the terms of the deal and the lenses through which one analyzes and examines the nuclear deal.It is crucial to point out that the winners and losers of such a deal will not be limited to the seven countries engaged in the talks. The repercussions or positive aspects of such a deal goes beyond the gilded circle. One can argue that the winners will be primarily President Obama, the Iranian government, Shiite proxies in the region, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, President Rouhani, the Syrian government, Bashar Al Assad, as well as Western corporations and companies.President Obama will finally have a quiet night as he would seal and achieve his awaited dream and foreign policy legacy. President Obama and his administration will also be creating the narrative that the deal is historic and a positive one for the world.On the other hand, the easing of sanctions on Iran will create a whole array of other winners including the IRGC, office of the Supreme Leader, and the Quds force (elite branch of IRGC which operates in extraterritorial landscapes).As the economic power of the IRGC and the Quds force increases, Iran's Shiite proxies in the region will benefit from the trickling down of these funds. Al Assad can be more assured that the Islamic Republic will continue supporting his government financially, economically, militarily, and through intelligence and advisory roles.Finally, non-state or state actors which will not benefit from the potential deal are those that are resisting the Shiite militias or are concerned with regards to the Iran's hegemonic ambitions, it's search for regional preeminence and supremacy and are worried about Iran's attempts to tip the balance of power in its favor. The question of whether the deal will be a good or bad one depends on how and who looks at the deal.When we analyze the negotiations and terms comprehensively and meticulously, it becomes evident that the current terms being negotiated will not only keep Iran's nuclear infrastructure and threat primarily intact, but it will create a whole new regional security dilemma, geopolitical concerns, and nuclear arms race in the region.--Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, a Harvard-educated American scholar and political scientist, is the president of the International American Council on the Middle East.

It marks the first endorsement from a major national labor union during the 2016 presidential campaign.""Hillary Clinton is a tested leader who shares our values, is supported by our members, and is prepared for a tough fight on behalf of students, families and communities,"" Randi Weingarten, the union's president, said in the statement.Weingarten and Clinton have been personal friends for years and the union threw its weight behind the Democrat during her 2008 campaign as well. In the resolution declaring its endorsement, the AFT said it polled its members twice and held two town halls before deciding which primary candidate to back.The endorsement comes at a helpful time for Clinton as Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders surges in polls. Still considered a long shot, Sanders has proven to be an attractive candidate to progressives in the labor movement, particularly those turned off by Clinton's unclear positions on President Barack Obama's looming trade deal. A number of local labor federations are flirting with the idea of getting behind Sanders, Politico reported.Clinton joined one of the AFT's executive council meetings last month, where she said teachers had become unfair targets of political attacks, according to the union.""It is just dead wrong to make teachers the scapegoats for all of society's problems,"" Clinton had said. ""Where I come from, teachers are the solution. And I strongly believe that unions are part of the solution, too.""Clinton plans to meet with officials from the AFL-CIO labor federation later this month to address their concerns with her unclear stance on the White House's trade pact, Reuters reported Thursday. The AFL-CIO vehemently opposed giving the president so-called fast-track authorization for the deal, though Congress ultimately granted it in June."

The boycott was also observed by the NCAA and United Auto Workers, among other groups. The NAACP said Thursday that the boycott would be brought to a vote in an emergency resolution after the South Carolina state legislature voted to remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol grounds.

""The situation is now under control,"" Ndayimanisha told Reuters.Burundi's opposition is boycotting the election, saying a decision by President Pierre Nkurunziza to seek a third term is unconstitutional. The announcement of his re-election bid triggered weeks of protests in April.The president cites a court ruling saying he can run again.Asked whether the election had been delayed, presidential spokesman Gervais Abayeho told Reuters in a phone text message: ""Postponed to July 21.""He said the president had signed the decree in response to a request from leaders of east African states plus South Africa.The African nations had sought a delay until July 30 to give time for Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to try to mediate between the opposing groups. Abayeho said such a delay ""would be beyond constitutional limits.""The constitution requires an election is held at least a month before the end of the president's term, which is Aug. 26. WASHINGTON ""DEEPLY CONCERNED""The U.S. State Department said on Friday it was ""deeply concerned by reports that fighting has broken out in several areas of Burundi and by recently broadcast remarks by Burundians threatening to use force against the government.""It condemned ""any armed activity or incursions into Burundi.""A general involved in a failed coup attempt in May said this week he and his comrades were still planning to oust Nkurunziza. The government says any attempt to destabilize Burundi would be met by the security forces.The crisis has alarmed a region with a history of ethnic conflict. Burundi's civil war had pitted rebel groups of the majority Hutus, including one led by Nkurunziza, against minority Tutsis, who commanded the army at that time.Rwanda, victim of a 1994 genocide in which 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis as well as moderate Hutus, were butchered, has vowed not to let such slaughter happen again.Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo denied her country was involved in Friday's clashes in northern Burundi.""I would think it's better for Burundi to concentrate on the issues Burundi has rather than looking for issues elsewhere,"" she added.Rwanda was among the nations calling for a delay in the election, along with Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa.

Its most common symptoms are disruptions in thinking and perception, and patients often have psychotic experiences.Although the link between smoking cigarettes and schizophrenia has been noted before, until now many doctors have followed a self-medication hypothesis whereby patients smoke to counteract the stressful symptoms of schizophrenia or the side-effects of antipsychotic medication.For this study, McCabe's team analyzed rates of smoking in people presenting with their first episode of psychosis and found that 57 per cent of these individuals were smokers.People with a first episode of psychosis were three times more likely to be smokers than those in the control groups.Robin Murray, a professor of psychiatric research at King's who worked with McCabe, said activity in the brain's dopamine system might be one explanation of a possible causal link between smoking and psychosis.""Excess dopamine is the best biological explanation we have for psychotic illnesses,"" he told the briefing. ""It's possible that nicotine exposure, by increasing the release of dopamine, causes psychosis to develop.""Previous studies, some by Murray, have also linked cannabis use to psychosis. But there is much debate about whether this is causal or whether there may be shared genes which predispose people to both cannabis use and schizophrenia.McCabe said the new results on smoking suggest ""it might even be possible that the real villain is tobacco, not cannabis"" -- since cannabis users often combine the drug with tobacco.

8,RELIGION,Black Pastors Across America Will Preach About HIV/AIDS This Sunday,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-church-and-hiv_us_559f5161e4b096729155e12a,The black church has always been a place of power for the African-American community. It was where black leaders secretly,2015-07-10,<p>The Rev. Tony Lee (left) is tested for HIV during a worship service at Community of Hope Church in Maryland.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559f5a101b0000d30427f849.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The black church has always been a place of power for the African-American community. It was where black leaders secretly preached the gospel of freedom to slaves meeting in underground churches. It was where clergy spoke against the injustices of segregation and rallied for the cause of civil rights.And on Sunday, it will be the place where pastors preach in unity about the epidemic of HIV and AIDS among African-Americans.The fourth national Day of Unity, organized by the NAACP, will bring the often taboo subject of HIV and AIDS to the pulpits of black churches across the country.The Rev. Tony Lee, pastor of Maryland’s Community of Hope AME Church, is one of several African-American clergy members who regularly gets tested for HIV in front of all his congregants during worship services. The powerful visual is a reminder to his members that HIV awareness is an important part of the fight for social justice in the African-American community. And for Lee, it’s vital that the church is a part of this movement.“Anywhere there are instances of people falling short of the fullness God wants for them, it’s important for the church to step in,” Lee told HuffPost. “Dealing with HIV/AIDS is a civil rights issue, but it’s also a kingdom of God issue. It’s about the work of the gospel.”African-Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV, compared with other American ethnic groups. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, black Americans accounted for about 44 percent of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents in 2010 -- even though they were only 12 percent of the U.S. population. That means the rate of new infection in the African-American population is eight times that of whites. In Maryland, where Lee’s church is based, the proportion of young people ages 20 to 29 newly diagnosed with HIV every year doubled between 2003 and 2012 -- jumping from 16 percent to 31 percent. The highest rate of new diagnoses is found in young people ages 20 to 24, according to Maryland’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.Lee said he’s going to focus his Sunday sermon on these statistics. About 42 other pastors have pledged to join in the Day of Unity so far, although that number is growing.When the NAACP started the Day of Unity program in 2012, some of the pastors who came in for training seemed influenced by the stigma surrounding HIV, according to the Rev. Keron R. Sadler, the NAACP's manager of health programs. People who don’t know the facts wonder if HIV is a “curse from God” or if it’s a disease that only affects lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Changing these misconceptions has been the campaign’s main challenge over the past few years, Sadler admits.""There's sometimes a lack of understanding and empathy for those impacted by HIV,"" Sadler said. ""And there are also doctrinal and theological challenges relating to sexuality, concerned with how the disease emerges, how it's contracted and treated. It's about raising awareness and dispelling myths.""The key, Sadler claimed, is framing the campaign as a social justice issue. Putting the structural and racial disparities associated with HIV against the backdrop of civil rights makes pastors more willing to talk about disease prevention and testing in church.The campaign also finds some black clergy members to act as ambassadors, traveling across the country to spread awareness. This word-of-mouth activism seems to be working. Sadler says that when the campaign started, she’d get eight to nine pastors in the room for a training session. Now, that number is closer to 30.In 2013 and 2014 combined, Sadler says, the NAACP’s efforts reached about 1,800 black religious leaders.“For over 200 years, the black church has advocated for social justice,” Sadler told HuffPost. “The black faith leader has been and is a trusted voice and they function as the social conscious of the community and, as a result, these leaders can be powerful forces for change.”At Lee’s church in Maryland, the whole congregation has gotten involved in the effort. The pastor says a team of church members have a ministry that goes to local night clubs to hand out harm reduction materials -- often condoms or information packets.Lee, who's an ambassador for the program, said over the years the pastors he’s spoken with around the country have grown more open and willing to talk about HIV.""The older parishioners may still be [hesitant about engaging in the topic], but I do think pastors are now able to have these conversations,"" Lee said. ""It's not as hard a conversation, as long as they have been equipped with information to know what they’re talking about and how they can connect it with the scripture."""

Oakland County Circuit Judge Lisa Gorcyca lifted the contempt of court charge and ordered they be released and sent to summer camp Friday. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559f335817000060043261d6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," PONTIAC, Mich. -- A judge who sent three children to a juvenile detention center last month for refusing to eat lunch with their father has decided to release them so they can attend summer camp.Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Lisa Gorcyca lifted her civil contempt order against the Tsimhoni children, ages 9, 10 and 15, at an emergency hearing Friday, ending their more than two weeks of incarceration at the Children’s Village detention center. The judge allowed the kids to immediately be transported to a popular Jewish overnight camp. “We’re really happy she’s allowed them to come out and enjoy camp like some of their friends,” Lisa Stern, attorney for mother Maya Eibschitz-Tsimhoni, told reporters at the courthouse. The ruling is the latest twist to a five-year divorce battle between Eibschitz-Tsimhoni and her ex-husband, Omer Tsimhoni. On June 24, Gorcyca found the children in contempt for disobeying her order to have a pleasant lunch with their dad and told them they were “brainwashed,” “defiant” and like members of Charles Manson’s cult, according to a court transcript. Gorcyca, a family court judge, warned she may extend their detention until they turned 18 if they didn't reconcile with their father.The judge's order locking up the children provoked public outrage since it was first reported this week by Fox 2 Detroit. One woman at Friday's hearing said her kids, classmates of the Tsimhoni children, had written them letters and picketed for their release. Gorcyca on Friday defended the punishment. She cited her lifelong dedication to working for children’s interests and criticized Fox for starting a ""media frenzy"" without learning all the facts of the case.“This was not a punishment. … The court agrees the placement is not ideal,” Gorcyca said, noting that no one had offered an alternative solution. “The decision was made so they could be placed in a setting where they would not be emotionally manipulated by their mother. … My intention was [for the children] to receive independent, objective and caring counseling.”A Children's Village staff member told the court that the Tsimhoni children were stable and had shown improvement in counseling sessions. They spent their time interacting with peers, attending summer school, and engaging in activities like hiking and art projects. Attorneys appointed to represent each child said their clients reported good treatment at Children's Village, but wanted to return home to their mom. The parents’ attorneys and the children’s court-appointed guardian ad litem, William Lanset, agreed that the children should be taken out of the center.“The plan has to involve taking them out of Children’s Village, but it cannot involve the mother,” Lanset told the judge before she ruled. “She damaged these children.”Eibschitz-Tsimhoni currently has custody of the children. Gorcyca and Lanset rebuked the mother for purposely alienated her kids from their father, sabotaging their relationship and visits, missing court dates, and ignoring court orders.  In June, the oldest child told the court he didn’t want to spend time with his dad because he was violent and had hit their mother -- an allegation the father denied. Gorcyca said Friday that she had never heard credible evidence of abuse or other wrongdoing by Tsimhoni. “This father has moved mountains to be part of his children’s life,” the judge said. Tsimhoni visits Michigan often, but lives and works in Israel. He attended Friday’s hearing by phone. His attorney said she would soon be filing a motion for change of custody. After the hearing, Eibschitz-Tsimhoni objected to complaints about her by Lanset and the judge, and said she has always wanted the children to have a good relationship with their father.“I’ve never done anything she said about me,” Eibschitz-Tsimhoni said.“The only thing I always said to the court is that love comes with love. ... You can't force somebody to love.”Each parent will be allowed supervised visits with the children at camp, and will split the costs. They and their attorneys are making plans for the kids to work with an expert or a program to rebuild their relationship with their father.Also on The Huffington Post:"

Check. And. Verify.There have been a lot of ridiculous details that have come out regarding the DeAndre Jordan free agency drama. First, the emoji-laden tweets from his Los Angeles Clippers teammates signaling their journey to Jordan's Houston home to get him to re-sign with Los Angeles, rather than jump ship to the Dallas Mavericks. Then came photos of chairs against doors and Paul Pierce once again proving why he is brought into these situations. Reports said that Jordan more or less ghosted Cuban, not returning communications as he began to have second thoughts about leaving LA. Then came a scathing interview Chandler Parsons gave ESPN, in which he said, among other things, that Jordan was ""scared"" to take the role of franchise player. But amidst all that, there still proved one nugget too good to be true, even if it's about the most Oz-like NBA owner, Mark Cuban:Don't get us wrong, the thought of a truly-over-the-rails Cuban hopelessly driving around Houston (Broussard later corrected the above tweet to clarify the location of an event that may or may not have happened) is beautiful. Cuban is crazy enough that many people took Broussard's information as fact. But we're not that lucky, and even Cuban isn't that desperate or unaware of DeAndre's address, as he pointed out himself.When you have Prof. Cuban schooling you in media ethics, you know you've got to reassess. Broussard did just that on Friday, tweeting an apology for not confirming with Cuban first.Regarding my Wednesday report: I should have attempted to contact Mark Cuban before reporting what my sources were telling me. I always try to carry myself with honesty and integrity both personally and professionally. I recognize that I tweeted hastily, I’m sorry for it, and I will learn from my mistake.Not on Mark's watch, Chris, will a mistake like this stand.So don't worry, guys, it's not like Cuban totally lost it over this whole losing Jordan thing after making trades and deals to build the future of the Mavericks around him.He just decided to fly to Houston and get a hotel room minutes from the player's home. He then had his driver take him to Jordan's home, which, I mean, the gate was just like, open -- so like, why would you not drive in and walk up to the door?After Jordan said he was on a date, Cuban, like any decent human, even offered to stop by the date to make it more fun. Let's just let Cuban take it from here:So let this be a lesson to everyone. If you hear a totally ridiculous story about just how far Cuban is willing to track down a free agent, don't take it at face value. Because there's probably a much more insane story Cuban is willing to explain in detail himself."

By contrast, S&P downgraded Greece’s credit rating to CCC- late last month and said the country has a 50 percent chance of ditching the euro as a currency. Germany’s economy expanded by 1.6 percent last year, and S&P analysts forecast growth to accelerate to 2 percent this year. Still, tumult in the eurozone ― fueled by both Greece’s default on a loan payment and the simmering conflict between Russia and Ukraine ― could destabilize Germany’s otherwise solid economic growth.“While the Russia-Ukraine and Greece crises have so far had a limited impact on the German economy, a renewed and deeper eurozone crisis would hit Germany’s economy more strongly through a number of channels,” S&P said. “However, we currently do not consider this a likely scenario.”"

Junipero Serra, the Spanish Franciscan who helped establish the mission system in California. And he offered a different way of looking at sin and sanctity.Speaking in Bolivia, the second stop on the three-nation “homecoming” tour for the Argentine pontiff, Francis denounced the “new colonialism” of global capitalism that is exploiting the poor and favoring the rich.But he went on to say:“I say this to you with regret: many grave sins were committed against the native peoples of America in the name of God. … I humbly ask forgiveness, not only for the offenses of the church herself, but also for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America.”That is a powerful statement, and delivered in Bolivia, whose people suffered so much colonial depredation.But Francis’ off-the-cuff follow-up was just as interesting, given that he will be facing the same issue when he canonizes Serra at an outdoor Mass in Washington on the first full day of his five-day visit.Serra has long been criticized for personally mistreating indigenous people (a claim many contest), or for being part of the Spanish imperial enterprise that brought devastation and disease to Native Americans, along with the gospel. They say there is no way Serra should be declared a saint, and there are efforts to have his statue removed from the U.S. Capitol, where it is one of two statues representing the state of California.Defenders say Serra actually worked to mitigate the excesses of the Spanish forces against the Native Americans, and that he should not be judged by present-day standards.That was the point Francis hit in his impromptu additions on Thursday:“I also would like us to recognize the priests and bishops who strongly opposed the logic of the sword with the strength of the cross. There was sin. There was sin, and in abundance, and for this we ask forgiveness. But there as well where there was sin, where there was abundant sin, grace abounded, through these men who defended the justice of the native peoples.”Will Americans accept such a nuanced view when it comes to Junipero Serra?Can Catholics begin to view their faith beyond the polarities of all good or wholly terrible?Saints are often seen as plaster icons of piety rather than flesh-and-blood Christians who made mistakes as well as pursuing holiness, for themselves and others.A good part of that blame can be laid at the door of the church, whose canonization process has too long focused on elevating the unblemished, or seeking to scrub away any stains that might darken a prospective saint’s image.Francis’ approach seems far more realistic, both about sin and saints. But is it simply a different way of explaining away the sins of people like Serra? Does it resolve the question of whether Serra should be made a saint? Can anyone qualify? Even the late Mother Teresa, who is a still a step away from formal sainthood, has her vocal critics.The Catholic Church is seen as more concerned with elevating its reputation than acknowledging its failings. Hence the fascination with Francis’ mea culpa, almost more than his “revolutionary” manifesto for sweeping structural reforms of the global financial system.Yet for decades, especially since John Paul II — who established a veritable “theology of apology” — popes have been making efforts to confess the church’s sins.The next step, one Francis is trying to take, is to lift notions of sin and sanctity — and religion itself — above the lower realm of simple black and white judgments.Those either/or verdicts are a kind of fundamentalism, forcing a blinkered acceptance of everything as good or a puritanical rejection of the whole because it is polluted by one failing or another — shortcomings that are the very reason for the church’s existence, and the pilgrimage of holiness.Also on HuffPost:"

The couple lack intimacy, not for a lack of love but because Nolan is gay -- a fact he has spent most of his life repressing.  Mexican-American actor Roberto Aguire comes in as Leo, a hustler whom Nolan pays for companionship, not sex, as he tries to come to term with his sexuality. The 27-year-old actor spoke to The Huffington Post ahead of the film’s nationwide release on Friday. Aguire opened up about what it was like to work with Williams in his final dramatic role and why he feels Latino actors shouldn’t be limited by the ‘Latino’ label.“Boulevard” deals with Nolan trying to come to terms with his sexuality after a lifetime of suppressing it. And you portray Leo, a character that becomes a catalyst for all of this. What drew you into the script the most when you first read it? [Screenwriter Douglas Soesbe] has a beautifully fluid way of writing dialogue that almost sounds like poetry. So when I read the script, immediately it captured me. I thought it was a story that had to be told. There is so much of this topic, especially right now, that’s prevalent in America. But it’s also very hidden in America. I think if you talk to anybody they know a person or they have an uncle, a brother, a son, a cousin who is in a later stage in their life who is coming to terms with who they really are. I think that story has to be told, it has to be shown that it doesn’t matter if you get to a later stage in your life, you can always make a change. You always deserve to find happiness, so that was the second thing that drew me to the script.And Leo also kind of suppresses the reality of being in the dangerous world of male prostitution. Leo is this beautiful character who is so complex and so complicated within this dangerous world that he lives in. I don’t think he’s a run-of-the-mill hustler [laughs], to put it that way. He kind of sticks out because he has this innate and hidden sensitivity into life, and almost like [a] childlike innocence that when you see him you just want to give him a hug, you just want to tell him that it’s going to be OK. You just want to tell him to get out of that situation.But for some reason, he’s stuck and he can’t get out -- very much like Nolan’s trapped in something that they’re just not happy with. But I think in Leo’s case it manifests itself in a physical danger and an emotional danger that he’s had to shut down in order to deal with. “Boulevard” was Robin Williams’ final dramatic performance. It’s been almost a year since his death on Aug. 11, 2014. When the news broke many who only knew him through his films mourned him like the loss of a close friend. As someone who had worked closely with him relatively recently, do you recall how you felt the moment you found out? Yeah, I was in my apartment in Los Angeles and I just remember feeling numb. I think the way you just described the general reaction to his death, which was ""the mourning of a close friend,"" is a testament to who he was. He had this ability to be able to touch people through every character that he did. Whether it was a dramatic role or a comedic role, after you watch[ed] one of his movies it was like you knew Robin Williams, you knew who he was.The great thing about Robin is, after you had the chance to meet him, that’s exactly who he was. He was this kind, generous, enormous soul who loved to interact with people -- be with people, to show people who he was. I think it speaks so highly of him and his humanity to see the kind of reaction that people had. Everybody around the world just united in this outpouring of love for Robin, and that’s beautiful to see. I think it’s so sad that we all lost such a genius of our time and such a humble and beautiful human being. But it’s beautiful to see how much people loved him, both the people that were close to him and the people that only knew him through his movies. Robin had a very long and successful career both in comedy and drama. What was your biggest takeaway as a young actor working with such a legend? So much. [laughs] It’s like a young writer saying, ""I sat down with Ernest Hemingway and I learned one thing."" It’s like, no way. There’s so much -- just to see the level of dedication was amazing. You’d think that a veteran actor working on a small independent project shooting over 22 days would maybe say, ‘you know what, I can maybe phone it in’ or ‘I can take a step back and cruise through this.’ I mean he could have easily with his talent; I think the movie would have still been great. But he showed up 120 percent in every single scene, there wasn’t a single scene that he wasn’t blowing everyone away with his performance. It didn’t matter how small the scene was or how emotionally trying the scene was.That’s amazing for a young actor to see, that drive [and] that dedication. I think nowadays there [are] a lot of young actors who are very lazy... celebrity-dom has made them lazy because they don’t have to be much of anything to just get in front of a camera and be a personality. To create a fully formed character full of life, struggle and humanity is tough. It’s not easy, and to see someone like Robin do it so effortlessly yet so meticulously precise[ly], it’s truly inspiring. As a young Latino actor it can be particularly hard to get your foot into this industry. Many find great roles in indie films, like Gina Rodriguez in “Filly Brown.” Where do you hope this opportunity will take you in your career? I hope that it just opens more doors. It’s interesting, I think as a Latino actor the biggest challenge is being called Latino because immediately the world has a perception of what that means. A Latino actor can’t play this and a Latino actor can’t play that because they’re Latino. Well, no. And I think Gina Rodriguez is a beautiful example of it. We can play anything we want to play. Just as an Aussie can play an American or a Scot can play a Frenchman or a Peruvian can play the world’s leading neurologist, I think Latinos can play anything. We can be anything that we want to be; we can be any role.I can tell you the huge difference between a Latino and [puts on a Scottish accent] a person from Scotland is you’ll never think that person from Scotland can’t do anything. I put on a Scottish accent and people are like ‘whaaa happened?!’ But it shouldn’t be mind-blowing. Latinos can do anything. I think that’s the biggest issue we’re facing right now, it’s Latinos being labeled as Latinos and being limited by it, as opposed to being labeled as Latino and being empowered by it. I hope that “Boulevard” is able to open a door for me to say, ""I’m a Latino actor and I can be a chameleon, I can be anything you want me to be.”  This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

You mustn't lose it.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559febda1b0000040727f97a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"It can be a long road to acceptance, particularly when it comes to who you are.That sentiment is what drives Robin Williams’ character Nolan Mack in the Dito Montiel-directed indie film “Boulevard.” The 60-year-old bank officer has led a lonely life despite his long childless marriage to his wife Joy (Kathy Baker). The couple lack intimacy, not for a lack of love but because Nolan is gay -- a fact he has spent most of his life repressing.  Mexican-American actor Roberto Aguire comes in as Leo, a hustler whom Nolan pays for companionship, not sex, as he tries to come to term with his sexuality. The 27-year-old actor spoke to The Huffington Post ahead of the film’s nationwide release on Friday. Aguire opened up about what it was like to work with Williams in his final dramatic role and why he feels Latino actors shouldn’t be limited by the ‘Latino’ label.“Boulevard” deals with Nolan trying to come to terms with his sexuality after a lifetime of suppressing it. And you portray Leo, a character that becomes a catalyst for all of this. What drew you into the script the most when you first read it? [Screenwriter Douglas Soesbe] has a beautifully fluid way of writing dialogue that almost sounds like poetry. So when I read the script, immediately it captured me. I thought it was a story that had to be told. There is so much of this topic, especially right now, that’s prevalent in America. But it’s also very hidden in America. I think if you talk to anybody they know a person or they have an uncle, a brother, a son, a cousin who is in a later stage in their life who is coming to terms with who they really are.

A Mexican-born migrant who has lived in the United States since 1973, Menocal said he enjoyed the exercise. He later took a job at the detention center serving breakfast, lunch and dinner to some 60 detainees and helping to clean the dining room, he says.The GEO Group, the private prison contractor that runs the detention center as a for-profit enterprise, paid Menocal $1 per day for his work -- a common practice across the United States, where many detainees toil for days in order to earn enough money to buy a phone card.But Menocal's job at the cafeteria wasn’t the only job he was expected to do. Each day, guards selected six detainees to clean each “pod” -- a cell containing roughly 60 migrants -- for no pay at all. One day, the six people chosen for pod cleaning duty refused to work. The guards swapped their orange jumpsuits for red ones, Menocal says, and punished them with solitary confinement, a chilling example for others who might follow their lead.“They put them in isolation -- we call it ‘the hole,’” Menocal told The Huffington Post. “You don’t get to see anybody all day, not even the guards who bring you food.”Now Menocal is a plaintiff in a lawsuit accusing the country's second-largest private prison contractor of unjustly enriching itself with the labor of immigrant detainees and forcing them to do custodial work for free under the threat of solitary confinement. On Monday, U.S. District Judge John Kane denied the GEO Group’s motion to dismiss the suit.The lawsuit, filed last year on behalf of current and former immigrant detainees at the Aurora Detention Center, said that GEO violated Colorado’s minimum wage law, as well as the Trafficking Victim’s Protection Act, a federal law that bars forced labor. A third claim under common law accused GEO of illegally enriching itself at the detainees' expense.While Kane denied GEO’s motion to dismiss the suit, he also said that Colorado’s minimum wage law wasn’t intended to apply to immigrant detainees. But the lawsuit will move forward based on the other two claims.A favorable decision for the former inmates could have broad implications for the largely privatized immigrant detention system, in which private companies routinely pay well below the minimum wage for custodial duties and other work. “GEO is making millions and millions of dollars a year, in part because they’re not paying the people who work at the facilities,” Nina DiSalvo, the executive director of Towards Justice, a nonprofit organization working with the attorneys handling the lawsuit, told the HuffPost. “It’s a pretty big deal that the regular practices that they’ve codified in policy handbooks would be forced labor.”GEO denied any wrongdoing in an email to HuffPost. “GEO’s facilities, including the Aurora, Colo. Facility, provide high quality services in safe, secure, and humane residential environments, and our company strongly refutes allegations to the contrary,” the statement says. “The volunteer work program at immigration facilities as well as the wage rates and standards associated with the program are set by the Federal government.”GEO has faced a series of allegations of misconduct at another immigrant detention center it runs in Karnes City, Texas, which houses immigrant mothers and their children. A group of women -- many of whom had passed the first stages of establishing an asylum claim -- launched a hunger strike before the Easter holiday to protest their continued detention. Some of the women said that guards at the GEO-run facility threatened to separate the mothers from their children if they continued to protest.The private prison contractor denied allegations of wrongdoing in that instance as well."

In April, PepsiCo announced that it was removing aspartame from Diet Pepsi in response to growing consumer concern about the artificial sweetener's possible adverse health effects, and replacing it with sucralose. On Thursday,the Wall Street Journal reported the drink company's CEO, Indra Nooyi, announced that the recipe change would take effect in late August of this year -- but also that Diet Pepsi containing aspartame will still be available for sale online after that time. There's no doubt that many, even most, consumers are dubious about aspartame. One analysis of social media in 2012 showed that 91 percent of posts about the sweetener are negative, and sales of diet soda have been plummeting for years. And many low-calorie drinks being introduced to the market today are sweetened with substances, such as sucralose and stevia leaf extract, that are perceived as being healthier than aspartame. Yet there's also no doubt that there exists a large cohort of consumers who have come to love the clean, almost metallic taste of aspartame-sweetened beverages. There might even be regular Diet Pepsi drinkers who are more loyal to aspartame than to Pepsi, and may be tempted to switch to Diet Coke after the Diet Pepsi changes.The infamous New Coke Fiasco of 1985 illustrated the very real risks of recipe tweaks -- so it makes sense that Pepsi would want to take steps to appease such customers. Especially because most mainstream health experts, including those at the FDA, have affirmed the safety of aspartame time and time again.Also on HuffPost: "

The actress and curator of the lifestyle website Goop shared a very important PSA with her readers this week in regards to yawning. If you're suppressing your yawns, she really wants you to stop. As Paltrow explained, while having dinner with Michael Lear -- a ""wonderful yogi and important quarterback for mindfulness and meditation"" -- she learned all about the importance of really ""leaning in"" to the yawn. “There’s a perception that it’s rude or that it means that you’re bored, but the reality is that it’s a very important mechanism for releasing stress,"" Lear explained to Paltrow. ""It feels good for a reason: Trust that your body knows how to calibrate itself.” From there, Paltrow goes on to explain the two different kind of yawns, which can lead to ""tearing."" But, she notes, tearing is not necessary for this exercise to be effective. Please see yawning instructions below:Although we're all for Paltrow's yawn enthusiasm, science doesn't have much to back it up.While a great number of theories about yawning exist -- like that it has to do with a lack of oxygen -- there's not much proof about why it actually happens. The most recent research suggests that yawning serves the purpose of cooling down the brain, and that we're probably more likely to yawn during the winter when the outside air can help with that cooling factor. But by all means, try out Paltrow and Lear's yawning methods. Yawning may be more powerful than we all thought! Also on HuffPost:"

The supermarket chain, still reeling from the revelation that it had systematically overcharged customers for packaged foods for years, is now facing a federal class-action lawsuit for using the term ""evaporated cane juice"" as a euphemism for sugar. The plaintiffs allege that Whole Foods called sugar ""evaporated cane juice"" on the label of its Gluten Free All Natural Nutmeal Raisin Cookies in an attempt to make consumers believe that the cookies ""do not contain as much sugar as they in fact contain."" Their suit was originally filed in a Missouri state court but is now before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. For a while, it seemed liked every food manufacturer interested in appealing to health-minded customers was citing ""evaporated cane juice"" on its ingredient label. It sounds healthier, and certainly more ""natural,"" than plain old ""sugar"" -- even though there's no actual difference between the two.Enthusiasm for the term started to dry up as early as 2009, when the Food and Drug Administration issued non-binding ""draft industry guidance"" recommending that producers avoid using it as a synonym for sugar. And it's taken a further hit in the past couple years, as consumers have filed a number of lawsuits regarding its use in jurisdictions all around the country. Though many of these suits have been dismissed in court, the food industry has started to recognize that its ability to attract gullible customers is outweighed by the legal risks it presents. Still, Whole Foods has stridently denied the claims in the Missouri lawsuit. The company's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the case on July 2. In their filing in support of this motion, they argue that no reasonable customer could have been led, by the label on its cookies, to believe that the product didn't contain sugar. That label, they say, ""prominently discloses both the total amount of sugar in the Cookies and the presence of added sugar by separately identifying brown sugar as an ingredient.""Given what the Whole Foods attorneys describe as the ""tepid response from courts to such claims,"" this suit's chances of success may not be great. But help could nonetheless soon come from the FDA -- in March 2014, its regulators re-opened discussion on the legal status of the term ""evaporated cane juice."" Also on HuffPost:"
