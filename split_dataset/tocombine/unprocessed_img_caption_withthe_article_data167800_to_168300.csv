Cooper said",2012-12-29,"NEW YORK - OCTOBER 02: R. Clarke Cooper attends 'The Case for Gay Marriage' panel during the 2010 New Yorker Festival at SVA Theater 1 on October 2, 2010 in New York City. (Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for The New Yorker)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafaef13c000018010b9883.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- R. Clarke Cooper, the head of the Log Cabin Republicans, is stepping down from his position at the end of the year after serving at the helm of the gay rights group for two election cycles. While the group searches for a permanent replacement, Gregory T. Angelo, the chairman of Log Cabin Republicans of New York State, will be stepping in as the interim executive director. ""There has never been a more exciting and historic time to be a gay Republican-with the wind at our backs following four referendum victories for the freedom to marry last November and the United States Supreme Court soon to rule on marriage equality, 2013 could mark a turning point in the fight for equal rights for all,"" said Angelo in a statement.Cooper took over as head of the organization in May 2010, after serving in the administrations of both former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) and former President George W. Bush. In an interview with The Huffington Post, Cooper said he let the national board of directors know of his decision to step down at its last meeting in October in Burbank, Calif. He notified Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus of his decision a week or two after the election. One Log Cabin Republican member who requested anonymity to speak openly said chapter leaders were not notified in advance of Cooper's decision. Some people, however, had known about his intentions as early as August, when Cooper was reportedly discussing it at the Republican National Convention. When asked what he is most proud of from his time at Log Cabin Republicans, Cooper -- without any hesitation -- cited the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, which barred gay men and women from serving openly in the military. ""I say that from a personal perspective, from a policy, organizational, institutional perspective, but also externally. I think probably the thing that ... really touched me the most in my time at Log Cabin is Bush administration colleagues and Army colleagues being so supportive ... and so congratulatory once the repeal succeeded,"" he said. Log Cabin Republicans filed the lawsuit that eventually led to a federal judge declaring DADT unconstitutional. They were also instrumental in pressuring Republicans in Congress to support the law's repeal in 2010. Charles Moran, chairman of the California Log Cabin Republicans, said that after the heavy GOP losses in the 2012 elections, the group had an even more important role to play in ""continuing to be a strong voice of inclusion in the Republican Party.""""We are ready to move forward, and need the professional infrastructure and bold leadership to ensure we have the resources, position and message to take advantage of the 2014 mid-terms and a seat at the table so the Republican Party truly understands that inclusion wins,"" Moran said. ""The grassroots is the backbone of the Republican Party and Log Cabin Republicans. It’s time to get back to basics.""Cooper's announcement comes a day after the group placed a head-turning full-page ad in The New York Times opposing former Sen. Chuck Hagel's (R-Neb.) potential nomination as secretary of defense -- citing his record on LGBT rights, Iran and Israel. Typically, such an ad can cost more than $100,000 -- a sum that many pointed out was out of reach for the group. Cooper said that the group received a hefty discount -- due to when the ad ran -- and raised funds from multiple donors in order to pay for it. ""This is being true fiscal conservatives. We're not paying full price. And honestly, if we had not raised the funds, we would not have run the ad,"" he said. The group stirred up controversy in the 2012 election cycle with its decision to endorse Republican Mitt Romney for president, despite the former governor's opposition to marriage equality.Going forward, Cooper said he wants to see more gay Republicans involved in politics.""It's one thing to call for change, and it's another thing to step up. Walk the walk, not just talk the talk,"" he said. ""Take a more active role in state and party politics. LCR has an important role as an ancillary group. But more importantly, LGBT Republicans need to take official roles in their state parties. They need to seek roles in the national party, and they need to run for office. That's where positive change will occur.""Cooper said he is currently considering a few other options as he figures out his next steps, although he declined to be more specific. He will, however, be fulfilling some of his obligations as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve that are required for promotion. This article has been updated to include the comments of Charles Moran."

And while a last minute ""micro deal"" is still possible, there will be little celebration, nor should there be.Whatever transpires in the next few days, look for politicians to point fingers at each other. By diverting your attention to those in the other party on Capitol Hill, their hope is, of course, to influence your assessment of who is to blame for taking the country so close to the edge.I argued in a prior post that the fiscal cliff is the result of a monumental Congressional political miscalculation back in the summer of 2011 -- one that a ""game theorist"" could have predicted based on an analytical assessment of the conditions under which politicians cooperate.Yesterday, Jon Horne, a PIMCO colleague, pointed me to a column by Nate Silver which takes the analysis an important step further. And Mr. Silver's findings are quite depressing.An anchor for Mr. Silver's analysis is the view that ""one of the firmest conclusions of academic research into the behavior of Congress is that what motivates members first and foremost is winning elections."" By combining this with realities on the ground, his analysis makes a strong case for continued political polarization going forward.Mr. Silver's conclusion is stark: ""As partisanship continues to increase, a divided government may increasingly mean a dysfunctional one.""It was once fashionable to argue that a divided government was good for the economy. The view then was that politicians would be too busy with political brinkmanship to get in the way of a dynamic private sector. As a result, unfettered by government interference, the private sector was more likely to invest, hire and prosper.It is hard -- very hard -- to make this argument today; and for at least three reasons.First, even diehard conservatives would admit that, since the 2008 global financial crisis, the country still has to overcome certain market failures. And for that, enlightened government policies are needed, including in clarifying property rights in segments still suffering from post financial bubble disorder.Second, it is hard to deny the extent to which America has experienced a worsening in the distribution of income, wealth and opportunities in recent years. If we are not careful, this will tear at the social fabric that underpins a dynamic and prospering private sector.Then there is the international evidence and related comparisons.America has fallen behind several other countries when it comes to enhancing our human and physical capital. In many cases this is not something that the private sector can (and will) -- remedy fully. In particular, some of the slippages in education and infrastructure need (and should be solved via) public-private partnerships; others involve (indeed, urgently require) more active government reform efforts.The bottom line is simple and consequential: Our self-inflicted fiscal cliff drama may be the most visible illustration of Congressional political dysfunction but it is unlikely to be the last one or the most challenging.Judging from Mr, Silver's analysis, we could well experience several iteration of the analytical equivalent of the fiscal cliff in the months ahead. And we would do so with declining policy flexibility.If left to fester, the related inability of Congress to step up to economic responsibilities would risk being associated with more than just sluggish growth, persistently high unemployment, and a growing sense of financial discomfort.It would also undermine the country's longer-term growth potential and, with that, the ability of many citizens to realize the American dream."

Walker/Getty Images for DIFF)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2417c3c000066000c06e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's the last weekend of the year, and while everyone is busy compiling their ""Best and Worst of 2012"" lists, I turn to my passion for cinema from a region that I adore: the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This year for MENA has been fruitful and full, even seeing the coveted Foreign Language Oscar going to A Separation, a film from Iran. The movements of the Arab Spring brought some new governments and some old governments dressed as new ones but importantly -- and in my personal opinion most welcomed -- the revolutions drew a lot of attention to a part of the world that, until then, had been ignored or worse, mistrusted by the west. As Pascal Diot, the Manager of Dubai Filmmart, so aptly put it at this year's Dubai International Film Festival ""the problem of the western world right now is that there is still a fear of the ""other"" and of someone who is different from them."" This year's Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF) ended more than a week ago and it exceeded all of my expectations. They were high, considering I wanted the festival to be both a watchable extravaganza of cinematic masterpieces and a marketplace of sales and distribution worthy of Cannes. Turns out, DIFF does things its own way, and if you come to it expecting it to be like any other film festival in the world, you'll be quickly proven wrong. DIFF sets its own standards high and then outshines them, year after year.Perhaps this trend mirrors the region's thirst for movies. There is no denying that cinema in the Middle East is becoming the business to watch -- pardon the pun. When it comes to the United Arab Emirates alone, gross box office has grown 200 percent since 2007, with barely 300 screens. Compare that with the 3 percent decline in GBO in the U.S., despite nearly 40,000 screens nationwide, and you get the idea. Audiences in the Gulf are also some of the youngest in the world, with nearly half of all GCC nationals under 25 years of age, and they rely on new trends in VOD, TV and video -- as well as good old traditional outings to the cineplex -- to satisfy their growing cravings for cinematic entertainment. In fact, Mohammed Al Mubarak, the chairman for Image Nation, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Media, pointed out that ""the average Abu Dhabi family goes to the movies three times a week, which is unheard of anywhere else in the world.""Image Nation International financed The Help, an independent film that was made for $25 million, generated more than $210 million in global box office and was nominated for multiple Academy Awards, claiming one for supporting actress Octavia Spencer. Even a less well received production like Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance made back its initial budget in worldwide box office. As a company, Image Nation admits to a dual agenda: to invest in international partnerships to finance overseas films and to use the profits from these to finance locally produced Emirati films. And in case you were wondering, they do exactly that with their projects. During this year's DIFF, Mohammed Al Otaiba, head of Image Nation Abu Dhabi, announced a new project to be directed by award-winning Emirati filmmaker Mohammed Saeed Harib, a yet untitled sports comedy scheduled to be filmed entirely in the Emirates in the spring of 2013 to be released in the fall of next year. The film will be Image Nation's third local production, following the seemingly never-ending success of Sea Shadow released in 2011 and the horror film Djinn, set for release in 2013. Harib's long running animated series Freej potentially reaches 35 million homes in MENA, and he's part of the highly anticipated film adaptation of Khalil Gibran's The Prophet produced by Salma Hayek. Going back to what Al Mubarak said, the way movies are watched may differ slightly in the countries of the GCC and the Emirates, yet the preferred choice of movies is eerily similar to what western audiences crave. At a recent visit to the VOX theaters in Mall of the Emirates -- one of the venues where films are screened during DIFF -- the line-up read like that of any local movieplex in NYC: Life of Pi, Jack Reacher, The Hobbit and Rise of the Guardians -- with some Bollywood thrown in and one Arabic title, the Egyptian box office topper Abdo Mota.DIFF also started and ended with two blockbusters, albeit ones directed by world cinema figures. Ang Lee's Life of Pi kicked off the festival in full 3D grandness and Wayne Blair's The Sapphires, the story of four talented Australian Aboriginal girls set in the late 1960s distributed by The Weinstein Company, was the closing gala presentation for this edition of DIFF. Arab cinema from MENA was definitely the intended beneficiary of the festival, but the powers-that-be at DIFF know how to bring in international names to create the buzz needed at any cinematic event. Cate Blanchett, Kevin Spacey, Colin Firth and countless other western stars graced the various red carpets for the myriad of galas that surrounded the films. Yet the presence of the Egyptian superstars and other well-known figures from the region definitely got most photographers' flashes in a frenzy on the red carpet. But the reason I came to DIFF this year was to observe the deals being made, to watch the trends for cinema from and about the region in years to come. This may not seem as glamorous as walking the endless red carpet with Freida Pinto at the Madinat Arena in Jumeirah, but to a lover of MENA cultures and a believer in the unifying power of cinema, it was in fact the most exciting aspect of the festival. Definitely all the films screened at this year's DIFF were winners by their sheer presence in the line-up, from the Jordanian When Monaliza Smiled, to the Kurdish story Bekas, from the Saudi Wadjda, to the Egyptian Winter of Discontent, from Emirati shorts like Safi and Half Emirati, to future cult classics like the U.S.-made Death Metal Angola and Indian Ship of Theseus. On separate occasions, I sat down with both Shivani Pandya -- managing director of DIFF -- and Pascal Diot and they both enlightened me to the ways DIFF helps filmmakers and cinema from the region. Diot pointed to the clear aim of the Filmmart ""We have two goals: One is to help the Arab world to make, to sell, to co-produce, to be exposed to the rest of the world; the other is to bring the remaining part of the world to the Arab world and to emphasize and develop co-production.""Shivani Pandya flanked by Abdulhamid Juma, DIFF Chairman & CEO (left) and Masoud Amralla Al Ali, DIFF Artistic Director (right) Cooperating is an idea that came up often during DIFF, in fact much is dedicated to creating bridges with other cultures, other countries and other organizations. Recently, a DIFF-curated series of films was screened at New York's Film Society of Lincoln Center, and Pandya admitted ""What was really interesting is the people who would typically visit Lincoln Center had no idea and no exposure"" to Arab cinema, yet, she continued, ""when they watched the films they were really intrigued and wanted to watch more."" Toronto this year had a good line-up of DIFF-supported films, and in Venice, Haifaa Al Mansour's Wadjda enjoyed a gala premiere. Of Al Mansour's journey, Pandya said ""Haifaa is like a beautiful case study for us. Wadjda blossomed right through, went through the motions at different levels, from Torino Film Lab, through to Dubai Film Connection,"" which are both ways DIFF helps filmmakers from pre- to post-production and every step in between. In fact there are so many resources and programs funded and supported by DIFF -- between Enjaaz, DFC and the Film Forum -- it's hard to keep track. And there's even another film festival in April, the Gulf Film Festival, to satisfy those spring cravings for cinema from the region.All in all, how DIFF differs from say, Cannes is ""a scale"", as Diot pointed out. He continued, ""the Dubai Filmmart is a regional oriented market, emphasizing Arab but also Asian and African content."" Pandya added that the Filmmart is ""a place to give these filmmakers a platform to sell their films and if they go to Cannes, it's beautiful and a really big market but they're competing with the rest of the world, where people's priorities may be European and American films."" When people come to DIFF, Pandya continued, ""they are looking for films from the region and when you add Asia and Africa, they are getting the best they can get out of the festival."" In the world of show business, finding an organization -- or even a person for that matter --that keeps true to its promise is nearly impossible. The entertainment industry is usually a land full of ""let's talk about it"" which only really mean ""I'll call you, don't call me"". But DIFF is ""DIFFerent"" indeed, keeping true to its two main mantras: ""Script-to-Screen"" and ""A Film for Everyone"". With around 300 distributors from the Arab world and nearly 200 from the remaining countries (plus countless more through their partnership with Festivalscope, a professional online platform where exhibitors and film programmers can access films in the DIFF line-up) this year's festival and Filmmart managed to keep its first promise. And with around 160 films from 60 countries, there was indeed enough choice to please even the pickiest moviegoer. Bottom line, if you're not watching films from or about this part of the world, you're not really watching films.All images courtesy of the Dubai International Film Festival, used with permission."

Monroe (26) enters the stadium after a welcome by head coach Mack Brown, left, before the start of an NCAA college football game against TCU on Thursday, Nov. 22, 2012, in Austin, Texas.(AP Photo/Jack Plunkett)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6c82e2200004301dce818.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dave Miller, National Football Post  With the 2012-13 college football postseason in full swing, let's take a look at some programs that can use a victory in their postseason matchup in order to finish the year strong and use the win as a possible momentum-builder moving forward.Northwestern: We know all about the Wildcats' struggles to make the NCAA tournament in men's basketball, but the football team's inability to win a bowl game is an equally pressing issue. NU will play Mississippi State in the Gator Bowl, and Pat Fitzgerald will be looking to bring the program its first bowl win since the 1948 Rose Bowl. The Wildcats have lost nine straight since reaching the Rose Bowl after the 1995 season. While the 'Cats have been outmatched in some cases, such as against Eric Crouch's Nebraska squad and a Peyton Manning-led Tennessee team, NU has also lost to Bowling Green. This season, NU gets a Mississippi State team that is not an SEC power. Fitzgerald has a chance to finish with a win in a season that featured terrible losses late to Michigan and Nebraska. Another postseason loss would leave a bad taste in the mouths of many 'Cat fans.Texas: The Longhorns endured yet another disappointing season, which included yet another blowout loss to rival Oklahoma. Mack Brown will enter 2013 squarely on the hot seat despite still having powerful people around the program squarely behind him, and the Longhorns now potentially have a serious off-the-field issue on their hands. Texas, which will play Oregon State in the Alamo Bowl, has won six of its past seven bowl games, so history is on the Longhorns' side. But Brown's squad looked dreadful in a Thanksgiving night loss to TCU, and the 'Horns were unable to bounce back in the regular-season finale to Kansas State. Brown cannot afford a loss to Mike Riley's Beavers, because it would be an even longer offseason for him than he should anticipate. A loss in the Lone Star State would lead to a long eight months in Austin.Michigan State: The Spartans will try to end the season on a positive note when they match up with TCU in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl. Because of the defense, many expected Mark Dantonio's squad to once again compete for a Big Ten title despite key losses on offense. The team dealt with a lot of issues, but the most important loss from last season was unquestionably quarterback Kirk Cousins, whose steady hand and leadership was sorely missed. Throughout the summer, word out of East Lansing was that Andrew Maxwell was ready to take over under center. But he completed just 52.9 percent of his passes, and he'll be facing a Horned Frogs defense that has a passing defense efficiency rating that ranks 29th in the country. Dantonio scored a huge win over Georgia last season in the Outback Bowl, but losing to TCU would give the Spartans a losing record this year. And that would make an already disappointing season that much worse.Oklahoma: The Sooners will battle Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel and Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl, and it's a chance for Bob Stoops to actually net a win in a showcase game this season. ""Big Game Bob"" hasn't exactly been prevalent in Norman as of late, and OU fell to both Kansas State and Notre Dame at home this season. In A&M, Stoops and Co. get one of the most talked about teams in the country led by the Heisman Trophy winner, and it will give Stoops a chance to regain his moniker.Clemson: Dabo Swinney's Tigers will face LSU in the Chick-fil-A Bowl with a chance to erase the memories of last year's Orange Bowl disaster against West Virginia. They also have a chance to actually beat a standout opponent in 2012 after falling to Florida State and South Carolina. Clemson is one of the most talented and athletic teams in the nation, but the Tigers have still been unable to deliver Swinney a standout victory. A game against an SEC power that was BCS worthy presents such an opportunity.USC: The Trojan players don't need a victory so much as head coach Lane Kiffin needs it. 'SC will battle Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl, and exactly no one would have predicted that the preseason No. 1 team in the nation would end up playing in El Paso on New Years Eve. But that's exactly what happened to the Trojans, whose defense was so soft that it ultimately forced coordinator Monte Kiffin to resign. Paul Johnson's Yellow Jackets present a tough challenge with the triple-option attack, and the Trojans have struggled against the run this fall, especially against Notre Dame and Oregon. Of course, Matt Barkley will be on the sideline, and motivation will be a real question mark for 'SC. But with questions about Kiffin's coaching credentials, it would help if he can show that he can keep a team motivated and get it prepared for a bowl game after the program sat out the last two postseasons. Certainly, the Trojans don't want to finish the season with five losses in their last six contests.Follow @Miller_Dave"

""In fact, if you could open a window whilst in flight, the air would rush out...because air moves from the high pressure cabin to the lower pressure outside, probably causing further injury and damage.""January Jones's dried placenta pills, which the actress admitted in March she consumed after giving birth, win no favor with Catherine Collins, principal dietician at St George's Hospital in London.""Nutritionally, there's nothing to be gained from eating your placenta - raw, cooked, or dried,"" Collins said. ""Apart from iron, which can be easily found in other dietary choices or supplements, your placenta will provide toxins and other unsavory substances it had successfully prevented from reaching your baby in utero.""Gary Moss, a pharmaceutical scientist, patiently points out to Palmer that while caffeine may have an effect on cellulite, rubbing coffee granules into the skin is unlikely to work, since the caffeine can't escape the granules to penetrate the skin.Phelps's claim that it's fine to pee in the pool because ""chlorine kills it"" is put straight by biochemist Stuart Jones, who reminds him that ""urine is essentially sterile so there isn't actually anything to kill in the first place"".And for Cowell, Kay Mitchell a scientist at the Centre for Altitude Space and Extreme Environment Medicine warns that very high levels of oxygen can in fact be toxic - particularly in the lungs, where oxygen levels are highest.""Celebrity comments travel far and fast, so it's important that they talk sense,"" said Sense About Science's managing director Tracey Brown. ""The implausible and frankly dangerous claims about how to avoid cancer, improve skin or lose weight are becoming ever more ridiculous. And unfortunately they have a much higher profile than the research and evidence.""To encourage more vigilance among celebrity pseudo-scientists in the future, SAS provided a checklist of ""misleading science claims"" it suggests should be avoided:* ""Immune boosting"" - you can't and you don't need to* ""Detox"" - your liver does this* ""Superfood"" - there is no such thing, just foods that are high in some nutrients* ""Oxygenating"" - your lungs do this* ""Cleansing"" - you shouldn't be trying to cleanse anything other than your skin or hair."
