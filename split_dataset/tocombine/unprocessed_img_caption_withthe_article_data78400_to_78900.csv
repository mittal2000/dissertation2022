While post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries and depression are critical issues that drum up worthy media attention, the answer is much more ordinary: sleep problems.Sleep disorders are ""the absolute number one military disorder when people come back from deployments,"" Lt. Col. Kate E. Van Arman, medical director at Fort Drum's Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic, told attendees at a defense centers health conference on Wednesday. ""Among TBI soldiers, it is the number two problem after headaches.""Van Arman went on to explain that two-thirds of military members sleep fewer than six hours per night, and one-third get fewer than five hours of rest, the Army News Service reported.Deployed soldiers face even worse circumstances, logging just three hours of sleep on average -- far less than the seven to nine hours of sleep the National Sleep Foundation recommends adults get nightly.And even when deployed soldiers do manage to catch some Zs, Van Arman pointed out, they aren't likely to be high-quality. Battlefields are a sensory overload zone, resulting in poor sleep that can affect soldiers' circadian rhythms.Sleep disorders can include insomnia, night terrors and teeth grinding, and sleep deprivation can have serious health consequences like increased risk for stroke, obesity and diabetes, as well as memory loss. And according to a 2013 study from the U.K., just one week of sleep deprivation can actually change a person's genes and impact inflammatory, immune and stress responses.

They found that children who had been exposed to indoor insecticides were 47 percent more likely to be diagnosed with childhood leukemia than those who had never been exposed. They were also 43 percent more likely to be diagnosed with childhood lymphoma.""Remember that pesticides are designed and manufactured to kill organisms,"" said study author Chensheng Lu, of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. Parents should avoid using these chemicals in the vicinity of their kids, and in places where the kids spend a lot of time, Lu told Live Science.In the new analysis, the researchers looked at the children's exposure to three types of pesticides: indoor insecticides, outdoor insecticides and herbicides. The largest of the studies included nearly 1,200 children with cancer. The investigators also found that children who had been exposed to herbicides were also 26 percent more likely to be diagnosed with childhood leukemia than those who had never been exposed.However, the researchers did not find an association between the use of outdoor insecticides and childhood cancers, according to the analysis.Previous research has suggested that the use of pesticides may affect children's health more than adults' health. Children may be particularly vulnerable because their immune systems are still developing, and therefore may provide less protection than adult immune systems. Their bodies ""may be less able to detoxify and excrete pesticides than those of adults,"" the authors of the new analysis wrote.Studies have also shown that children have experienced acute toxic effects on their respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous and endocrine systems as a result of exposure to pesticides at home or school, the researchers said.Because the use of pesticides is increasing, ""public health policies should be developed to minimize childhood exposure to pesticides in the home,"" the researchers wrote in the new analysis. Meanwhile, parents, teachers and doctors should learn about common types of pesticides and labeling information, and be aware of the potential health effects of those chemicals, they added.""Every effort should be made to limit children's exposure to pesticides,"" the researchers noted.The study was published Sep. 14 in the journal Pediatrics.Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter.

4,POLITICS,"The Fed Is Considering Raising Interest Rates, But The Economy May Not Be Ready",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-interest-rates_us_55f1bb6de4b03784e27858bd,The Fed balances concerns about inflation with its commitment to full employment.,2015-09-14,"<p>Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, heads the central bank committee that will decide whether to raise interest rates next week.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f1c0272c00003600aaf680.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Should we be more concerned about the pace of job growth or the threat of inflation? That is the question the Federal Reserve will face on Thursday when it decides whether to raise interest rates above near-zero levels, where they have remained since December 2008. The Fed is reportedly considering a modest increase in the federal funds rate -- the most influential of the interest rates it adjusts -- based on its judgment that economic conditions have improved enough to begin curbing inflation.Preventing runaway price inflation is one half of the Fed's ""dual mandate,"" along with maintaining full employment. But the balance between full employment and price stability is zero-sum: When the Fed increases interest rates to limit inflation, it does so by deliberately reducing economic demand. Higher rates mean consumers and business owners have less disposable income, which drives down demand for goods and services. Lower demand means employers need fewer workers. And the existence of fewer jobs reduces upward pressure on wages, which, in turn, keeps prices in check. That is why a Fed interest rate hike is controversial: Critics fear that the risks of slowing down job and wage growth outweigh the potential benefits of curbing inflation in the near term. What's more, they point out, inflation remains below the Fed’s target level of 2 percent. (Click here for a longer explanation of how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy affects the economy.)In fact, the debate over an interest rate increase in September -- or at any other time -- is really a debate about the kind of economy we want to have. If you err on the side of protecting savers and lenders from inflation, you are more disposed to support higher interest rates, even if may do not back a rate hike now. On the other hand, if you favor economic policies that prioritize workers -- the jobs available to them and the wages they earn -- you will prefer low interest rates and be concerned about a prospective rate increase. Preempting inflation, but maybe too soonThe Federal Reserve has elicited praise for steering the U.S. out of recession faster and more effectively than its counterparts in Europe. The central bank has maintained interest rates at the “zero lower bound” -- 0 to 0.25 percent -- in the six years since the Great Recession, during which time it engaged in quantitative easing, an unprecedented multi-trillion-dollar asset purchasing program. It has done all this despite the criticism of politicians, pundits and inflation hawks in its own ranks who argued that the Fed's policies were opening the door to hyperinflation.Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argues that the Fed has shown a strong commitment to job growth in the wake of the recession. “Nobody reasonable believes this Fed ignores employment,” he said. Posen served on the monetary policy committee of the Bank of England from 2009 to 2012 and is in frequent contact with Federal Reserve officials.Despite the overall dedication to low interest rates, in recent months the Federal Open Market Committee, the group of Fed officials responsible for adjusting interest rates, has moved toward raising rates -- even though inflation remains much lower than the target of 2 percent. When the committee last met in July, it indicated that it was satisfied enough with job growth to lift rates in September. Yet then, as now, millions of Americans were out of work and wages were stagnant. Inflation at the time was even lower: That month, personal consumption expenditures excluding energy and food -- one of the inflation measures preferred by the Fed -- had risen just 1.2 percent since the previous July. Since then, Fed officials have expressed some trepidation that a rate hike in September may be too soon. But tellingly, this caution was prompted not by lackluster jobs and wage growth, but by the volatility in the U.S. stock market in August. The mostly liberal economists who oppose a rate hike say that even before the stock market troubles, the economy was still creating too few jobs to warrant raising rates.But Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, points out that part of the Fed's job is to anticipate in advance when excessive inflation may be about to take hold. “The Fed moves preemptively: The fact that we are not where we want to be does not mean we do not want” to raise interest rates, Swonk said. Indeed, John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, has warned that the central bank should not wait to hit the actual 2 percent inflation ceiling before moving to raise rates. Doing so would risk forcing the Fed to raise interest rates drastically to “reverse course,” Williams said in a June speech, which could cause undue harm to the economy.“I see a safer course in starting sooner and proceeding more gradually,” Williams said.Where's the wage growth?Those who oppose the pending interest rate hike say that the official unemployment rate masks an economy that has not yet achieved full employment. Wages have risen a measly 2.2 percent in the past 12 months, they point out, and 6.5 million people are still working part-time involuntarily. The economy needs an additional 3.3 million jobs just to reach pre-recession employment levels.Forget September, these economists say: The Fed should not raise interest rates until nominal, or pre-inflation, wage growth reaches at least 3.5 percent -- and maybe even as high as 4.5 percent.“We are almost at the sweet spot of unemployment for business, but that is not how I think we should make policy,” said Josh Bivens, a monetary policy expert at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute. “We should make it for the vast majority of American households that make a living on wages.”Bivens argues that the Fed should be willing to tolerate inflation slightly higher than the target of 2 percent in order to drive up demand for labor enough to spur an increase in wages. But even so, he doesn't think inflation will reach that level without 3.5 percent wage growth.In late August, Bivens and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz joined dozens of grassroots activists from the ""Fed Up"" campaign at the Kansas City Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium to protest a potential interest rate hike.Other economists would also like to see wages grow more, but think the Fed can raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point -- the amount reportedly under consideration -- without undermining that goal.The Fed will stop raising rates “on a dime if they think the economy is slowing to the point where wages were not going to accelerate,” Swonk said. “It is not a one-way street.” She added that while she would prefer to wait for higher wage growth, she respects the Fed’s apparent concerns about future inflation.Posen, similarly, would like to wait on an interest rate hike. But he is unsure whether low rates can impact the number of workers re-entering the workforce, since they have not done so already, even as unemployment went down and other economic indicators improved. ""The question is not whether government should not do anything, but whether monetary policy is the right tool,"" he said.Bivens concedes that a 0.25 percent rate increase might not slow down the job market, but doesn't think that's a persuasive argument in favor of the policy. “You can argue it is a very, very small move in the wrong direction, but I would say we should not go in the wrong direction at all,” he said. Fears of an asset bubbleSome advocates for an interest rate increase argue that prolonged low rates have already sparked excessive inflation -- less in the area of consumer goods, which is what the Fed's 2 percent target addresses, and more in the real estate and stock markets. Low rates can create bubbles, they say, by making it cheaper for banks and companies to borrow, which encourages companies and investors to bid up stock and housing prices above their real value. Mark Calabria, a financial policy expert at the Cato Institute, told HuffPost last month that he wants the Fed to begin raising rates over time, because “we're long past any job market benefit, and long into risks to financial stability.” Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump echoed this reasoning in August, saying he was not sure low interest rates are ""a very good thing, because I really do believe we're creating a bubble.""But Posen does not see evidence of a bubble. “The stock market boom is a recovery from a huge bust,” he said.

She soon received backlash, including terrifying death threats. On Sept. 7, Proudman, a barrister in human rights law and feminist legal activist, tweeted a screenshot of a message she received on LinkedIn from Alexander Carter-Silk, a partner at Brown Rudnick. Instead of focusing on her career or work abilities, he pointed out her ""stunning picture."" ""You definitely win the prize for the best Linked in picture I have ever seen,"" he wrote.Having no time for such behavior on a professional networking site, Proudman called him out.""I am on linked-in for business purposes not to be approached about my physical appearance or to be objectified by sexist men,"" she wrote. ""The eroticisation of women’s physical appearance is a way of exercising power over women. It silences women’s professional attributes as their physical appearance becomes the subject.""In a phone interview, Proudman told The Huffington Post she’s received both positive and negative feedback since posting the tweet.""It’s sparked a real debate about how do we call out sexism, when is it safe to do so and how can women feel comfortable in calling sexism out,"" she told The Huffington Post. ""Because the backlash I’ve received has been phenomenal."" That backlash has included death threats, including a detailed email from someone threatening to cut off Proudman’s head. Others have told her they know where she works and lives. She has also been called a ""feminazi.""Proudman has also received hundreds of supportive emails and LinkedIn messages. She told HuffPost that fathers have reached out to thank her for standing up for their daughters. She’s received support from Twitter users as well, including women who have shared their experiences with sexism.Proudman told HuffPost that Carter-Silk has since sent her an email to apologize. He also told legal news site Roll On Friday that his comment was ""unfortunately misinterpreted."" She continues to receive backlash though.""People say, 'We already have equality. We don’t need the feminist movement. We live in the existence of equality. What more do we need?' Well hardly,"" she said. ""Once you call out sexism and then your life is threatened, it just shows the kind of patriarchal society that we do live in and we need to break that glass ceiling for sure.""Despite the nasty comments and death threats, Proudman refuses to be suppressed when it comes to speaking up about misogyny. ""It just shows the face of nature of sexism in our society,"" she said. ""When you threaten the social order, when you threaten patriarchy, this is what you -- this is the result, threats to your life to silence you.

He galvanizes his core audience -- liberals who criticize gun laws and long for universal healthcare -- and alienates the non-choir folk who might actually have something to glean from his films. That was blindingly transparent at Thursday's opening-night Toronto Film Festival screening of Moore's new documentary, ""Where to Invade Next."" A packed house at the expansive Princess of Wales Theatre not only laughed at the movie's many witty moments, but gleeful cheers and applause broke out at regular intervals as the film's interview subjects pointed out the copious examples that prove America, however great, is culturally, politically and sociologically inferior t0 other countries. Sitting among the crowd, and agreeing with the bulk of their endorsements, I wondered whether what should be seen as a relatively nonpartisan doc would register anywhere outside of the admitted echo chamber that exists within the mainstream entertainment media. Will anyone who doesn't already question America's military industrial complex see this film? Aren't proponents of women's rights already aligned with the points Moore raises? Doesn't anyone with half a brain think the country's lack of paid-vacation laws is chintzy?The answers to these questions, in all likelihood, are resounding affirmatives. That's not to say that ""Where to Invade Next"" isn't good. Its execution, in fact, is quite effective. It's built on the guise of Moore assuming the Pentagon's duties by ""invading"" -- aka visiting -- other countries to poach ideas that would make America a fairer, more hospitable place. Along the way, he learns that Italy provides citizens with eight weeks (!!!) of paid vacation. In France, school-cafeteria lunches are five-star affairs. Slovenia offers free college education. Portugal has decriminalized all drug use and seen its usage rates plummet. Women's health clinics in Tunisia are government-funded.Wouldn't it be great if America emulated such policies? ""Obviously,"" the TIFF viewers shouted by way of periodic applause in response to the film's talking heads, who blanch at the notion that the United States doesn't offer the same advantages. The fact that ""Where to Invade Next"" is built with practical alternatives to America's systemic flaws makes it a stirring work of political theater, and with only a gentle presence from Moore throughout, progressive audiences will continue to howl, just as they did at Thursday's screening. But watching the movie with such a devout congregation was a living reminder that a Moore documentary serves constituents rather than the overall populace. With peachier projects like ""Bowling for Columbine"" and ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" that was inevitable. With ""Where to Invade Next,"" which ends on a hopeful note and should be seen as Moore's least parochial outing yet (there's only one George W. Bush crack!), it's just a shame. This isn't a quote-unquote liberal movie -- it's a look at the decency that exists across the globe but is often undervalued on our home turf.For continuous updates from the Toronto Film Festival, follow Matthew Jacobs and Erin Whitney on Twitter.Also on HuffPost:For a constant stream of entertainment news and discussion, follow HuffPost Entertainment on Viber."

If only Donald Trump knew that ...In an attempt to get The Donald to look in the mirror and realize just how ridiculous his entire campaign has been thus far, Bill Maher decided to give him a little taste of the racism he's been spewing.For his closing monologue on ""Real Time"" Friday night, Maher channeled the real estate mogul-turned-reality TV host-turned presidential candidate and called for Americans to rally against the growing number of Australians ""taking"" our jobs.""Australia is not sending us its best people,"" he said. ""They’re bringing drugs -- yes, enough for everybody, but still -- they’re rapists -- OK, not rapists, but they do a lot of fucking -- and I assume some are good people.""Maher also brought up the fact that Australians are even taking American film roles (read: Cate Blanchett, Naomi Watts, Hugh Jackman), and it just isn't fair. But aside from the joking, the comedian had a serious point to make -- it's not undocumented workers Trump should be worried about, it's the people who continue to hire them. And if he really wants to rethink immigration, the employers might be a good place to start.Watch the entire monologue below. Also on HuffPost:"

Since the 2007 release of his documentary “A Jihad for Love,” which chronicles the lives of gay and lesbian Muslims in 12 countries, he’s been labeled an infidel in Saudi Arabia.Sharma’s latest autobiographical documentary strives to highlight the complexities of his religion.“I’m still a little shaken from it all,” said New York resident Mamta Prakash after watching the premiere at Cinema Village in the West Village. “It really brought across his strong faith and love for Islam and was extremely moving.”The documentary opens with clips from Sharma’s marriage to his husband at City Hall in Manhattan. He grapples with his identity as a devout Muslim when many fellow Muslims condemn his wedding. He is faced with what he calls a crisis of faith.“I need evidence that my faith is strong enough to survive this journey,” he says.Equipped with an iPhone 4S and two small cameras, Sharma then takes viewers on one of the largest human pilgrimages in the world. “I was terrified, I was absolutely terrified,” Sharma said. “I even wrote my will before I left because I did not know if I would come back alive.”In the film, Sharma comments on Mecca’s growing commercialization, calling it the “Mecca of capitalism.” After prayer rituals at a holy site, he finds himself in a crowded Starbucks at a huge adjoining shopping mall.At one point, Sharma meets a Pakistani man who had come to Mecca to be forgiven for participating in an honor killing of his brother’s wife.

Sharma takes viewers to what he calls the “front line of Islam”: a growing dissonance between its peace-loving majority — who come to Saudi Arabia to complete the hajj, a once-in-a-lifetime religious obligation required of all able-bodied Muslims — and government-supported violent extremists.Sharma’s conclusion in the film is complex, if not revelatory. The hajj teaches him to reconcile his sexuality and faith from within.“It’s not about Islam accepting me,” Sharma says near the end. “It’s up to me, as a gay Muslim, to accept Islam.”The film has met both acclaim and criticism.“There is an enormous amount of debate and discussion about it,” Sharma said. “Scores of people have responded positively at festivals, and that has been heartening.

Adams, PsyDBen was a wounded man. His wife divorced him to marry her lover and moved far away making it inaccessible and expensive for Ben to father his three children in a meaningful way. He defined himself as ""a man reduced to a paycheck."" By the time Ben entered my office, he showed classic symptoms of depression: isolated, self-loathing, overworked, and unhappy. Yet he wanted to be a happier man and took his therapy seriously. Conservatively, 1 in 10 men suffer from some degree of depression. But even if a man is not suffering from a clinical disorder, 10 in 10 men face fear, disappointment, anger, conflict and stress. No matter what method used or treatment pursued to help people recover from challenging or painful life experiences, many therapists, physicians, and other health care providers underutilize a very potent healing agent. It's called compassion and self-compassion. Just as the body's immune system protects against disease, compassion and self-compassion operate like an emotional immune system capable of warding off feelings of alienation, inadequacy, and even shame. By design, compassion connects and self-compassion soothes.Compassion begins with empathy. Empathy evokes thoughts and feelings that acknowledge and connect with the suffering of others (I know how you feel). Fortified with empathy, compassion calls forth the intent and actions to help alleviate that suffering (I can relate to how you feel and I want to help you.) Self-compassion is being aware of your own suffering with an interior response that is supportive and kind rather than harsh (I made a bad mistake but I'm a good man and I can find a way to get through it).Compassion is everywhere. Men perform countless acts of compassion on individual and grand scales. For example, a man exhausted from a day of work may drive miles to see his child play soccer. Another man spontaneously mows his elderly neighbor's lawn without seeking praise or compensation. Around the world, first responders risk their lives to save others in distress. The tragic day of September 11, 2001 is a grisly demonstration of compassion in action. Each of these acts is born of compassion and I believe compassion and self-compassion are at the core of living a healthy, happy, and connected life.◊♦◊Ben's wounds of loss, anger, disappointment, and fear aroused his feelings of suffering and isolation. This self-absorption created a merry-go-round of thoughts and images that repeated his negative emotional and behavioral responses. Caught in this circular pattern, Ben unwittingly unleashed a myriad of invisible consequences. He compounded the problem by self-medicating through increased alcohol consumption and poor eating habits.At the beginning of what turned out to be a pivotal session, Ben told me that his ex-wife's new husband, Larry, had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He shared this news with a slight but telling smirk. Ben wanted to talk about how to be the best father to his children during this tragic ordeal. This presented me a golden opportunity to challenge a piece of his self-absorbed worldview.""Sure,"" I said, ""it's a great idea to discuss your fathering. Then I paused and asked him, ""What kind of father do you want to be as your kids experience illness and death?"" Ben looked startled and said, ""What do you mean?"" ""Well,"" I replied, ""how do you want them to know you? Do you want them to see your indifference and satisfaction at Larry's suffering?"" Ben just shook his head and said, ""No.""""Then speak beyond your hurt and anger and come from a place of compassion. What might that look and feel like? What would your children see in you? This is a chance to give life to the man you talk about becoming.""Ben thought for a moment and said, ""Let me get back to you on that one.""At the start of his next session, Ben handed me a letter he had sent to Larry and his ex-wife. I read it aloud:Despite all that has happened between us, no one deserves to suffer or be deprived of living a full life. I am sorry for any grief I may have caused and I am sorry for what you both must endure. Please let me know the way I can help the two of you, especially when you need extra help with the kids.Over time, Ben grew happier, in no small way, by embracing compassion and practicing self-compassion. He talked about cooperating with his ex-wife rather than ""being in competition."" Practicing self-compassion gave Ben an interior language that comforted him and strengthened his emotional resilience. Ben merged compassion and self-compassion into his masculine schema and told me, ""acting more compassionately makes being a man a bit easier."" Without knowing it, Ben stacked the deck in favor of living a more physically and emotionally healthy life.---Published in partnership with The Good Men Project and the Society for The Psychological Study of Men and Masculinity.Edward M.

Take advantage of the warm weather and end-of-season produce, and make these recipes before the weather turns cool. 1. Golden GazpachoI have made this delicious gazpacho over and over (and over) again -- and love keeping a pitcher in the fridge for solo lunches on hot days. The recipe is adapted from Oleana chef Ana Sortun's inspiring cookbook, Spice: Flavors of the Eastern Mediterranean. With its silky texture and pure tomato flavor highlighted by a touch of curry powder and turmeric, it's a perfect example of Sortun's brilliant use of spices to create rich, full Mediterranean flavors that leave you feeling satisfied. GET THE RECIPE2. Double Chocolate Zucchini BreadThis quick bread makes the perfect afternoon snack whenever you're in need of a chocolate fix. It has a deep chocolate flavor from unsweetened cocoa powder and bittersweet chocolate chips, yet it's not so sweet that it tastes like dessert. It's also loaded with zucchini, so there's some virtue in it. GET THE RECIPE3. Homemade Tomato SauceI have to admit: I have an entire shelf in my pantry devoted to my favorite jarred tomato sauce. I'm usually in a hurry when I make pasta for dinner -- and who has time to simmer a sauce on the stove for over an hour?! But when tomatoes are in season, and I've got a little extra time, I love to make tomato sauce from scratch. It's so delicious and always makes me question how I can ever eat that run-of-the-mill jarred stuff! This recipe is based on one of the most popular Internet recipes, cookbook author Marcella Hazan's Tomato Butter Sauce. GET THE RECIPE4. Juicy Steakhouse BurgersI worked in a fine dining steakhouse for six years, so I'm very picky when it comes to my burgers. If they're not tender, juicy and flavorful, they're just not worth it. Problem is, it's difficult to replicate steakhouse burgers at home because most steakhouses use closely-guarded recipes and custom ground beef mixes, both of which are hard to find. After many trials, I discovered the solution to making great steakhouse burgers at home is to use readily available 85% lean ground beef, a panade -- which is a mixture of bread and milk that keeps meat tender and juicy even when cooked to medium-well -- and lots of seasoning. GET THE RECIPE5. Southern Peach CobblerWho can resist sweet yellow peaches topped with buttermilk biscuit batter, baked until the fruit is bubbling and the topping is golden? The recipe is a great way to use up all those summer peaches, as well as any other summer fruit you'd like to mix in (hint: blackberries would be wonderful). Be sure to add a scoop of vanilla ice cream or dollop of sweetened whipped cream on top! GET THE RECIPE"
21,COLLEGE,College Scorecard Sandbags Equity in Higher Education,"Patricia McGuire, ContributorPresident, Trinity Washington University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-scorecard-sandbag_b_8129780.html,"The College Scorecard completely ignores the increasingly non-traditional nature of the nation's undergraduate student body today, and instead, presents data as if most college students are privileged children whiling away four years in some grove of academic luxury.",2015-09-13,2015-09-13-1442157293-4012324-TopTendataillustration.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-13-1442157293-4012324-TopTendataillustration-thumb.jpg,"In the tsunami of data about higher education that the Obama administration unleashed on an unsuspecting nation late last Friday, one fact emerges that was already painfully clear: the ""haves"" in higher education have quite a lot; the ""have nots"" struggle mightily. And this economic chasm is seriously influenced by gender, race and social class -- issues on which the College Scorecard is silent, but which affect just about every factoid presented. The silence of the administration on the impact of discrimination on collegiate data piles more sandbags on those institutions working the hardest to help disadvantaged students find some equilibrium on the playing field -- schools that serve large numbers of low income students, students of color, mostly women whose struggles with pay equity are legendary. The administration wonks worked feverishly to exorcise their obsession with the notion that more data will be more ""transparent"" and, hence, ensure better college choices among students and families. The reality is that even smart wonks educated at some of the best of the ""haves"" can be blind to social reality; their monument to algorithmic gymnastics in the College Scorecard obscures some of the most important and painful facts about college life and American society today.Start with the data set that is really new in the White House College Scorecard (which has existed for quite some time): the data pulled from IRS records about the earnings of student loan borrowers 10 years after they first enrolled. While we all might wonder whether taxpayers really understood that their tax records would be used in this new and curious way to create some kind of correlation to educational quality in college -- data privacy and consent being somewhat elusive concepts for the federal government except when enforcing rules for colleges -- the information is now in the public arena and so merits examination.We can argue about proportionality in using earnings data to assess the quality and effectiveness of a college or university; a nation preoccupied by materiality and driven by acquisitiveness exalts bankrolls over justice, we know this already. Love it or hate it, the reality is that the earnings data is now in play thanks to the Obama administration. Thanks, Obama!Quite starkly, the earnings data illustrates this immutable fact of American society: discrimination on the basis of race and gender, well known in all national pay equity studies, also subverts the data about earnings of college graduates. Nationally, pay equity studies show that women on average earn about 78% of what men earn, and the pay equity gaps by race and gender are much worse. The administration presents the collegiate earnings data as if it were value-neutral, not only with no reference to the mission of institutions that may have different values from those the administration apparently exalts, but even more devastatingly, with no reference to the pernicious effects of gender and race discrimination on career opportunities and earnings. In fact, the data is an illustration of America's continuing shame when it comes to the still-unequal playing fields of career opportunities and earning power. While women and people of color who have attended and graduated from college fare better than their counterparts who have not gone to college, the pay equity and career opportunity gaps remain quite stark. The rich get richer, and the rich tend to be predominantly white and male; low income students, students of color and many women progress more slowly and with fewer avenues for significant progress, the figleaf of ""undermatching"" initiatives notwithstanding.To illustrate the pernicious effect of earnings data presented as simply a value-neutral indicator of something about academic quality -- which is it not -- consider this chart (I am not a wonk, but I did prepare this chart based on data in the College Scorecard and the federal data system IPEDS):This chart presents the ""top ten"" schools by average earnings found on the Scorecard in each of four categories (I chose these based on likely comparisons for my own university, Trinity in Washington): private nonprofit universities (blue), Catholic colleges and universities (purple), women's colleges (red), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (green). The chart is arrayed in that order which is the order of earning power of the top ten in each category from most to least. Knowing national pay equity data, can anyone be surprised by this clear illustration of the unequal playing field? The colleges and universities with the highest earners have pitiful proportions of Black students and Pell recipients, and modest enrollment of women. (The percentage of federal Pell Grant recipients is a marker for the proportion of low income students in the population.) A synopsis of the data shows that the private nonprofits (which include the wealthiest universities in the nation) earn on average $81,900; for that group of schools, the proportion of Black students enrolled is just 5%, women are 40%, with Pell Grantees just 16%. Among Catholic colleges, the top ten earnings average is $68,400, with 4% Black students and 53% women, and 15% Pell Grantees. Among women's colleges, the top earnings average is $51,150 with 15% Black students and 31% Pell. Among HBCUs, the top earnings average is $42,190 with women at 68% of their populations and Pell at 53%.Many flaws arise in considering the earnings data. The data purports to represent average earnings ten years after the first enrollment for student loan borrowers. For many students of all backgrounds, those first ten years after first enrollment may well be full of life events that can repress or alter earning power significantly -- if not delayed completion in graduate school, then first and second jobs, marriages, children and families, parent care. Many women, in particular, find it necessary to stop out of the job market for a period of time, or to reduce work hours, in order to have children and care for families. The value-neutral approach to the collegiate earnings data ignores the facts of life about women and families.Moreover, in other data released almost at the same time as the College Scorecard, the National Center for Education Statistics provides an updated report on ""non-traditional"" students in higher education. As this report has illustrated for years, and reinforced in the latest data, 74% of all undergraduates have at least one ""non-traditional"" characteristic, and more than 55% have two or more non-traditional characteristics such as having children, being a caregiver, delaying college enrollment, attending part-time, working full-time. These characteristics affect every single data point on the College Scorecard, including graduation rates (non-traditional students move through college on non-traditional pathways, but the Scorecard uses the scurrilous IPEDS graduation rate as the norm) and loan repayment rates (which, in fact, reflect the deferment of loans while still in school or the income contingent repayment plans which the Department of Education has encouraged). The more such characteristics that are present in a student body, the more likely it is that the data will be different from what the administration has deemed to be the ""norm"" whatever that may be. But the College Scorecard completely ignores the increasingly non-traditional nature of the nation's undergraduate student body today, and instead, presents data as if most college students are privileged children whiling away four years in some grove of academic luxury. To the extent that there are still some of those kinds of students in college, they are more likely to be children of privilege, predominantly white and economically secure, able to attend college full-time with parents paying the bills -- and, quite possibly, with lucrative jobs awaiting thanks to the old boys' network of their families and the schools and colleges they have been so fortunate to attend.The Obama administration claims that the new College Scorecard will provide more ""transparent"" data to students and families trying to decide which college to attend. Unfortunately, by presenting some data in value-neutral or misleading ways, and ignoring other truly important questions in the college choice process -- What are the student's abilities? Where will she get the best academic advising and support services? Where will he have the continuous engagement of real faculty? What is the campus climate for women, or students with disabilities, or students with children, or poets or engineers or, yes, true scholar-athletes? What is the mission of the college? Will the student be able to thrive spiritually as well as academically? -- the administration presents a data mashup with limited utility for consumers but large potential for misrepresentation of social realities."
22,PARENTS,Is Hating High School Inevitable?,"Jacqueline Dooley, ContributorBlogger, entrepreneur and mom of two girls. Author of Doorways...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-hating-high-school-ine_b_8129520.html,"I hated high school. Just like my daughter, I was shy, self-critical, approval-seeking and incredibly sensitive. She has all of these qualities, and on top of that, she's battling nausea, extreme fatigue and stomach pain due to her oral chemotherapy medication and her anti-rejection medication.",2015-09-13,2015-09-13-1442151308-6645624-hatinghighschool.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-13-1442151308-6645624-hatinghighschool-thumb.jpg,"Last week was back to school week for many people, my own kids included. My daughters started ninth grade and sixth grades, respectively. While my sixth grader had no trouble getting back into the swing of things (she attends a tiny, bucolic private school where she's gone since she was four), it was much, much harder for my 14-year-old.She is an incoming freshman at a large public school with more than 1,800 kids. She spent the majority of her elementary and middle school years at the bucolic private school I mentioned above. She graduated with a class of 18 eighth graders who she's known since young childhood, and moved into a school with over five hundred 9th graders who have no idea who she is. They don't know she nearly died at the age of 11, but a liver transplant saved her life or that the cancer that took her liver has spread throughout her lungs. They don't know that she's sick because right now, she doesn't look sick.I thought putting a 504 plan in place would be enough to alleviate some stress. Section 504 of The Rehabilitation act of 1973 requires that public schools provide eligible students ""reasonable and appropriate"" accommodations so they can participate fully in school. My husband and I met with various school officials (the nurse, guidance counselor, school psychologist, etc.) before the school year began to create this plan. It included things like allowing her more time to get homework and tests completed due to being absent because of her illness. I thought we were all set.But I forgot how physically and emotionally punishing high school can be, particularly for incoming freshman. And it seems so much worse now. There are over twenty security guards at my daughter's new school and two police offers on the grounds at all times. Students have to wear photo I.D. badges around their necks. If they are even a minute late, they need a note from a parent otherwise the lateness is unexcused. This can only happen a couple of times before they get detention. There are many more rules -- this is just what I've picked up during the first week.On her fourth day of school, my daughter needed labs drawn at the local hospital a mile away. She hadn't eaten breakfast (there was no time). She was about two minutes late and had to find the attendance office, then she lost the note I gave her so she had an unexcused absence. She went to class starving and with an aching arm due to the blood draw and felt like she'd failed her first period teacher because was unable to get the lateness excused. She was so flustered and stressed that she forgot to take her medication in the morning. This has never happened before. Transplant recipients must take their medication at exactly the same time every day or they risk organ rejection. We all panicked, but since she's so good about her medication then this one slip up should be fine (though I still worry). I hated high school. Just like my daughter, I was shy, self-critical, approval-seeking and incredibly sensitive. She has all of these qualities, and on top of that, she's battling nausea, extreme fatigue and stomach pain due to her oral chemotherapy medication and her anti-rejection medication. She has also stepped from a very sheltered, protected environment into a place that makes very little sense to her. The reality of her situation is that she may not live to graduate high school. This is a blunt, painful truth that is woven into the fabric of her life, a thread of fear that touches every single thing she does.So when she came home on Friday, exhausted and stressed, and admitted that no part of her day was enjoyable -- not even lunch, not even art -- it gave me serious pause. I know it's the first week, and I told her this. It may get better. It will definitely get easier as she becomes more familiar with the school grounds and the new rules and as she makes friends. Most of us just had to suck it up. Hating high school is inevitable, right?Yet, for a teen who has cancer, whose future is terribly, tragically uncertain, there is something perverse about watching the clock, waiting for the bell to ring. She literally does not have time for this kind of stress in her life. I don't want her to spend her days trying to fit into a system that makes no sense in the context of her life. It seems to me the system is set up to make it easier for all the adults to maintain order and achieve the goal of delivering an education and I get that, I really do. And yet... and yet... is this environment good for the kids? There seems to be a pervasive attitude of suspicion that the kids operate under, as though screwing up is an eventual certainty. Is this prison or high school? I question these things because I always have, but it is even more important now than it was when my daughter was younger because the thought of her watching the clock each day (even at lunch time) fills me with desperation. I want her to enjoy at least some part of her day. The question that keeps circling around and around in my mind is, ""does hating high school have to be inevitable?"" I want to believe that the answer is ""no"" but I'm not feeling very hopeful right now."

They - and We - Deserve an Expanded Social Security,"Nancy Altman, ContributorFounding Co-director, Social Security Works",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/happy-grandparents-day-th_b_8129542.html,"After 80 years, Social Security has stood the test of time.

As the wealthiest nation in the world, at the wealthiest moment in our history, there is no question that we can afford to expand Social Security.  The real question is how can we afford not to do so.",2015-09-13,2015-09-13-1442154586-6892798-GrandfamiliesGraphicUpdatedWOHashtagcopy.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-13-1442154586-6892798-GrandfamiliesGraphicUpdatedWOHashtagcopy-thumb.jpg,"Mother's Day has been an official, nationally recognized day for 101 years. Father's Day became a national holiday 58 years later, in 1972. And Grandparent's Day, which comes on the first Sunday after Labor Day, became a national holiday in 1978, just six years later. Some joke that every day is Children's Day.For a nation that claims it values families, it fails miserably to put its money where its mouth is. There are no national mandates or programs for paid family leave, universal child care, job flexibility or the many other policies that help families succeed. But one national program that truly values families is Social Security.Social Security protects all generations. It is the nation's largest and, despite its modest benefits, most generous children's program. If a worker dies or becomes disabled, his or her children receive benefits until age 18, and the care giving parent receives benefits until the child reaches age 16. (Children of deceased or disabled workers used to receive Social Security benefits until age 22 if they were in college, university, or vocational school, but the Social Security student benefit was repealed in 1981.) Virtually all grandparents, aged 62 or older and retired, receive Social Security benefits. Two-thirds of Social Security beneficiaries aged 65 or older get half or more of their income from Social Security. One third rely on Social Security for virtually all of their income. These grandparents often provide the essential backstop for working families. Grandparents routinely step in to help their adult children, overburdened by family-unfriendly work Grandparents provide care to their young grandchildren, pick them up from school, and care for them after school. Grandparents care for their grandchildren when they are sick. With parents working increasingly long hours to make ends meet in a difficult economy, the role of grandparents is perhaps even more important than ever. In many families, the role of the grandparent is not just helper, but primary caregiver. Nearly eight million children live in families headed by grandparents or other relatives. Grandparents are often essential to military families where parents are deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. Not surprisingly, Social Security is the most important source of income for families where grandparents are rearing their grandchildren. Without Social Security, 59 percent of grandparent-headed families would live in poverty. Even with Social Security, twenty-one percent of these families have incomes below the poverty line.It is time to increase Social Security's modest benefits and add benefits to help America's working families. The Social Security Works All Generations Plan does just that. It increases benefits across the board and ensures that those benefits won't erode over time. The plan also provides a minimum benefit of 125 percent of poverty, so that seniors who have worked hard their whole lives do not spend their golden years in poverty. It restores the student benefit, so that children whose working parent has died or become disabled can obtain higher education while incurring just a bit less debt. And it provides care giving credit toward retirement for family members who take time out from the workforce to provide essential care.The All Generations Plan brings our nation into the 21st century by adding family benefits other industrialized countries offer. It provides up to 12 weeks of paid family leave at the birth or adoption of a child, as well as paid sick leave. It provides a $1,000 payment at the birth or adoption of a child. All of these additional benefits fit perfectly within the overall framework of Social Security. After all, Social Security is insurance against the loss of wages. In addition to death, disability, and old age, wages are lost, and often additional expenses are incurred, when workers become sick or when their families need them, whether as the result of illness or the birth or adoption of children. Consistent with Social Security's history of self-financing without borrowing, the plan pays for all of these improvements and restores Social Security to long-range actuarial balance, while spreading the costs fairly, recognizing that it is time for the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share. After 80 years, Social Security has stood the test of time. It is incredibly efficient, spending less than a penny of every dollar on administration; the remaining 99 cents is paid in benefits. The question isn't can we afford to expand Social Security. As the wealthiest nation in the world, at the wealthiest moment in our history, there is no question that we can afford to expand Social Security. The real question is how can we afford not to do so.When President Franklin Roosevelt signed Social Security into law, he described it as ""a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means completed."" True to this vision, past generations have built additions onto this sturdy structure. Now it is our turn.The movement to expand Social Security is growing. Poll after poll shows the American people overwhelmingly favor expanding Social Security. Every Democratic Senator but two and the vast majority of Democratic members of the House of Representatives support expansion. Nearly a dozen Social Security expansion bills have been introduced in this session of Congress alone. Two presidential candidates - Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin O'Malley - have detailed proposals to expand Social Security. Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton has spoken generally of her support for enhancing Social Security.Grandparents Day is a time to honor grandparents, and especially those who are going above and beyond by taking on the responsibility of rearing their grandchildren. It's also a time to fight for them. Expanding Social Security would truly honor today's grandparents and tomorrow's. It would also improve the lives of mothers, fathers, children, and, indeed, all of us, both individually and collectively. Now is the time to lift up every generation, every family, and every individual by expanding Social Security. That would truly result in a very happy Grandparent's Day for all of us.Nancy Altman is co-author, with Eric Kingson, of Social Security Works! Why Social Security Isn't Gong Broke and How Expanding It Will Help Us All (The New Press, 2015), which provides a detailed description of the Social Security Works All Generations Plan."
