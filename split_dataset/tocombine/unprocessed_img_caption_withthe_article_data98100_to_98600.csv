Tsipras, whose first foreign visit will be to Cyprus, will join him on Tuesday in Rome before meeting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday.France and Italy, the two governments that have pushed hardest to loosen the strict budget austerity imposed at the start of the euro zone crisis, may offer Varoufakis and Tsipras a sympathetic ear when they visit.But they have both said they would not accept the new leftwing government's call for a ""haircut,"" writing down part of Greece's 320 billion euro debt and potentially exposing their own Treasuries to billions of euros of losses.Varoufakis told Dijsselbloem on Friday that Athens did not want an extension to the bailout but a new accord and would not deal with the troika mission overseeing the bailout.On Saturday, he told the weekly Agora newspaper that Greece needs ""fiscal breathing space"" with a bridging deal of a few weeks while a new agreement with creditors is worked out and economic reforms including a crack down on tax evasion begin.With both sides keen to prevent tensions during the first few days of the Tsipras government slipping out of control, he warned against ""verbal fetishism"" and said the differences could be overcome.While there was resistance in Europe to a straight haircut on the face value of the debt, there was more willingness to explore other options including extending maturities or cutting interest payments that could have the same effect.In an interview with German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, Greek Economy Minister Georgios Stathakis said it would be better to link the country's debt repayments to its economic growth rate as it needs a feasible solution to bring its sovereign debt under control.Athens faces about 10 billion euros ($11 billion) in repayments this summer and is shut out of international bond markets while it waits for a final bailout tranche from international lenders of 7.2 billion. WARNING ON ECB FUNDING TO BANKSHighlighting the risks Athens faces if no deal is reached by the Feb. 28 deadline, European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen said Greek banks, already facing serious deposit outflows, would be cut off from ECB lending.As well as ensuring continued ECB support for the banks, agreement is needed for some 7 billion euros in funds to be released. Without the funds, Greece would probably be unable to meet 10 billion euros in debt repayments that fall due between June and September.However, Merkel repeated that further debt cancellations were unacceptable and Athens would have to respect its obligations.Varoufakis said Greece would continue to issue new short-term T-Bills while talks proceed, even though Athens has already reached a 15 billion euro issuance limit agreed with the troika.But that would do little to prevent the crisis that could ensue if the banks lost support from the ECB and the issue is likely to feature heavily in discussions next week. With financial markets on edge, Greek banking stocks have fallen by nearly 40 percent since Sunday's elections.Following his finance minister's visit to Paris on Sunday and to London on Monday, Tsipras himself will visit Rome on Tuesday to meet Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Paris on Wednesday, where he will meet President Francois Hollande.Notably absent from the list of destinations was Berlin or Frankfurt.

A new study from the University of Texas at Austin found that the more lonely and depressed people are, the more likely they are to binge-watch television. The researchers conducted a survey on over 300 millennials, asking how often and how much they watched TV, how often they felt lonely, and examining various measures of depression and self-regulation. Those who lacked self-regulatory skills reported being unable to stop clicking ""next"" even though they knew there were other things they needed to do, indicating a lack of self-control. The data also showed that feelings of loneliness and depression were directly correlated with binge-watching.Loneliness, depression and lack of self-control have also been implicated in other types of binge behavior, such as heavy drinking and excessive social media use. ""Even though some people argue that binge-watching is a harmless addiction, findings from our study suggest that binge-watching should no longer be viewed this way,"" study author Yoon Hi Sung said in a statement. ""Physical fatigue and problems such as obesity and other health problems are related to binge-watching and they are a cause for concern. When binge-watching becomes rampant, viewers may start to neglect their work and their relationships with others. Even though people know they should not, they have difficulty resisting the desire to watch episodes continuously.""Previous research has shown this to be the case. A 2013 marketing study found that 71 percent ofge-watchers had intended to watch just one or two episodes, and then ended up getting sucked in. The research also found that more than half of binge watchers prefer to watch at home alone. The research will be presented at the International Communication Association Conference in Puerto Rico this May."

Anti-bailout Syriza, led by the 40-year-old Alexis Tsipras, won Sunday's snap general election, but it was unclear whether he would have enough seats in parliament to form a government alone, or whether he would need the support of a smaller party. (AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14486240000350076f23d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with economist Edward Hadas about the significance of Syriza's victory for the Greek economy and the eurozone.The left-wing party Syriza won national elections in Greece last Sunday with a program promising to roll back the stringent austerity measures imposed on the country in the wake of the financial crisis. Syriza wants to renegotiate the terms of Greece's bailout agreements with its creditors -- the troika made up of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Troika leaders have insisted that Greece must fulfill its commitments, raising the prospect of a confrontation that could destabilize the eurozone, 19 of the 28 members of the European Union using the euro as their currency. In his first week in power, Greece's new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras signaled that he would not relinquish his anti-austerity campaign pledges. He moved quickly to block the privatization of state assets and promised to rehire public workers, causing the Greek stock market to tumble. ""We are coming in to radically change the way that policies and administration are conducted in this country,"" Tsipras vowed at his first cabinet meeting.Economists have disagreed over the right approach to save the Greek economy and whether Syriza's economic proposals will be effective. Some have warned that austerity is a painful necessity and Greece just can't afford the financial instability caused by Syriza's policies. Others argue that austerity is actually harming the Greek economy. Edward Hadas, the Economics Editor at Reuters Breaking Views, told The WorldPost in a Q&A that while Syriza is inexperienced, the new government could actually be good for Greece. Do you think Syriza is right to oppose the austerity program?A lot of serious economists agree that by squeezing cash out of the economy, the austerity measures have made it very difficult to drive demand, increase wages and curb unemployment. The troika plan was badly designed. It made a bad situation worse.Syriza's finance minister does recognize the underlying problems that led to the bailouts in the first place. The Greek economy has many structural problems, including dependence on imported capital from the rest of the eurozone. Some of Syriza's policies could make this better, others could make it worse. For example, they've proposed reversing the increase in the retirement age for civil servants, which would be a waste of human capital. However, they have also said that a serious effort must be made to widen the tax base, which would clearly be very good for Greece. What has Syriza promised to do exactly?The fact that you have to ask shows their policies are not very clear. Various members of Syriza have made lots of radical noises. Yet their suggestion to walk away from the reconstruction plan is not reconcilable with their pledge to stay in the euro.Have Syriza's decisions in its first week in power made things any clearer?Several things they've said have alarmed people, but they are mostly a sign of inexperience. Syriza is clearly not used to being part of the government. Many members of the new government are academics not accustomed to the world of politics.What does all this mean for the eurozone?I think Greece will compromise over the bailout and will not end up leaving the euro. European debates tend to include lots of ultimatums and then a last-minute deal. If Greece does leave the euro, the financial markets will react out of fear the eurozone could break up. Yet financial markets don't get the idea of a political project. The political determination to keep the euro together has only increased in the last three years.There is always a chance that things could go badly wrong. Currently, there is wide recognition that the European project is a good thing. This could change if an anti-Europe party came to power in an important European country, for example the National Front in France.How bad are the challenges facing Greece right now?It's a mess: Unemployment is high, investment is low, the tax base is narrow, and educated people are leaving in droves.These are longstanding issues. Greece faced a civil war after World War II and was later ruled by military regimes. Some social divisions have not been resolved. Economies need strong civil institutions and these have not taken root in Greece.It is promising that Syriza is made up of political outsiders, and is willing to consider more unorthodox policies. They appear committed to breaking the cycle of those who have governed Greece so badly in the past.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

The Syriza party won Sunday's national election.Greece's economy has shrunk by about 30 percent since 2008, according to data compiled by the World Bank. Its economy was smaller in 2013 than in 2005. About a quarter of its workers are unemployed, according to the Hellenic Statistical Service, or Elstat. Youth unemployment exceeds 50 percent.""We are not going to cooperate with a rottenly constructed committee,"" Varoufakis said, according to news reports. The troika has been monitoring Greece's progress toward commitments made by previous administrations as part of its bailout, such as selling off state assets and trimming worker benefits and government payrolls.Varoufakis added that the Greek government would not seek to delay the approaching Feb. 28 deadline to extend the terms of the country's bailout. ""This platform enabled us to win the confidence of the Greek people,"" he reportedly said.""The Greek state has a future, but what we won’t accept as a future is the self-perpetuating crisis of deflation and unsustainable debt,"" Varoufakis said, according to news reports.The comments come as Greece's economy staggers to grow following a brutal, six-year recession that decimated household finances and appears to have been worsened by the very bailouts that were supposed to rescue it.Just over 10 percent of the 240 billion euro bailout has been used to finance government operations, according to figures compiled by MacroPolis. The rest has gone to repaying creditors and bailing out banks.It is against this backdrop that previous comments by Varoufakis, highlighted Friday by the radio program ""Left Business Observer,"" may prove instructive in trying to understand the Syriza party's aims and the lengths to which Greece's new ruling party will go in order to reduce the country's debt burden.In a November interview, Varoufakis told Doug Henwood that the world should expect a ""potentially explosive negotiation"" if the Syriza party should win Greece's then-upcoming election.""The only thing you can really do is negotiate with the rest of Europe,"" Varoufakis said. ""But to negotiate, to be taken seriously, you have to have a credible threat. You have to be prepared to blow the whole thing up, simply by being intransigent if you are not taken seriously.""So, this is my recommendation: Prepare for a very tough, very painful, potentially explosive negotiation.""In a 2010 interview with Henwood, Varoufakis recounted a conversation he claimed to have had with an official at the European Central Bank, who told him that the international creditors planned to push the country into a ""permanent recession"" in order to drive down wages as part of a plan to reform the Greek economy.In a November 2014 interview, Varoufakis predicted that countries pushing Greeks to accept austerity -- such as Germany -- would be doomed to repeat the experience of the victors of World War I, who imposed such harsh conditions on Germany that many believe it led to the rise of Adolf Hitler.""I think we'll have a repeat performance of that,"" Varoufakis said of Germany today."

ALL TOGETHER is hosted by Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, executive editor of HuffPost Religion. You can download All Together on iTunes, or Stitcher. When Raushenbush was growing up in the 70’s, his Presbyterian church in Madison, Wisconsin had a woman serving on the altar as associate pastor. This just seemed normal to him. He later found out that women in a pastoral leadership position in the church at that time was not common and is still the exception rather than the rule within Christianity. Recently, Rev. Libby Lane was consecrated as Bishop of Stockport making her the first woman Bishop in the Church of England. The stain glass ceiling break-through only occurred after years of debate and still, at her consecration, a priest stood and objected. In Orthodox Christianity, the Roman Catholic Church and in some Protestant denominations, women are not allowed to serve as pastors or priests. Pope Francis, who has been so open on many issues, has slammed the door shut to any debate on women serving as priests. Given that women surrounded Jesus during his ministry, were the last to stay with Jesus at the cross, and the first to see him resurrected; it appears clear that Jesus believed in the spiritual power and perception of women. So, why does the church not hold women in the same esteem as did Jesus, the founder and center of the faith? To help him understand the continuing sexism in the Christian Church, Raushenbush spoke with four extraordinary women: the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church Katharine Jefferts-Schori, the recent US ambassador for Religious Freedom the Rev. Dr. Suzan Johnson Cook, The President of Union Theological Seminary, The Rev. Dr. Serene Jones, and the one and only Sister Joan Chittister. These four women spotlight the Church’s original sin of sexism; however their lives and wisdom inspire hope for the future when all the church might benefit from the spiritual power of women on the pulpit as well as the pew. Raushenbush recommends a new book by Rev. Dr. Susan Shaw called Reflective Faith: A Theological Toolbox for Women. The book offers readers to consider for themselves the role of women in the church and in scripture in an easy to read style.The podcast ends with a final question, answer and demand from none other than Beyonce who asks: ""Who runs the world? Girls."" "

(Photo By Douglas Graham/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e698260000350083bf9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Republicans in Congress aim to revamp an anti-regulatory law from the Newt Gingrich era in an effort to paralyze new financial, environmental and labor rules with a never-ending string of court challenges.Next week, the House will consider a bill to amend the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, which then-Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.) shepherded through Congress. The 20-year-old law imposed a host of cost-benefit standards on federal regulators, including a requirement that they consider the costs that new rules might impose on state and local governments. But in order to garner Democratic votes and protect against a presidential veto, Gingrich made a significant concession: The regulators' calculations could not be challenged in court.That would change under a new bill from Reps. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) and Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.), which would open up every aspect of these complex analyses to judicial review -- leading to an inevitable barrage of lawsuits from those affected by the pending rules.The proposed Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act is part of a multifront attack on the federal regulatory state by Republican lawmakers, and Democrats have overwhelmingly opposed the measures in the House. But Sanchez signed her name to the current bill, and some Senate Democrats are working with Republicans on parts of the plan.Regulatory cost-benefit analyses are inherently vulnerable to challenge. The long-term benefits of regulations are often difficult to quantify, while the costs can be comparatively immediate and straightforward. The problem is even more acute with regard to public health and safety issues, where the value of human lives must be weighed financially against corporate costs.Foxx spokesman Sheridan Watson defended the bill as a way of making the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act function properly. ""It simply picks up on where ... the existing UMRA statute leaves off, giving it teeth through an enforcement mechanism to ensure adherence to the law and acting as a deterrent for agencies skirting the rulemaking process,"" he said.Katherine McFate, president of the Center for Effective Government, disagreed. ""It doesn’t improve or streamline the regulatory process, which is already plagued by hurdles and delays,"" she said. ""It would rob the American people of critical upgrades to public health and safety standards."" ""Cost-benefit analysis has been and will continue to be a blueprint for big banks to water down, dilute and block Wall Street reforms,"" warned Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate for Public Citizen. ""The bill ensures that if financial agencies adopt reforms based on cost-benefit analyses that do not reflect Wall Street preferences, big banks will be waiting in the wings with a lawsuit to overturn the rule.""Rep. Sanchez was not immediately available to comment.Financial reform advocates are particularly concerned about the bill because many regulations under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law have yet to be written. Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, described the bill as an ""effort to cripple regulators’ ability to protect the public interest by loading them down with new paperwork requirements and enabling even more industry lawsuits."" She said it ""would be a gift to Wall Street and would invite a resurgence of the reckless practices that caused such enormous economic damage just six years ago.""The renewed focus on the cost-benefit analysis is the brainchild of conservative power lawyer Eugene Scalia, the son of the Supreme Court justice. The GOP has been unable to derail either Obamacare or Dodd-Frank in Congress or in the courts on constitutional grounds, so Scalia turned the attack onto the cost-benefit and economic impact analyses that regulators performed in developing rules. He looked for weak spots and aimed his arguments at conservative judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Already, under existing law, Scalia has managed to overturn some Dodd-Frank rules. But the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act's prohibition on judicial review appears to have stymied other attempts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce raised the law's restrictions in its formal criticism of the Volcker Rule, a central tenet of Dodd-Frank. The corporate lobbying group denounced regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for concluding that the Volcker Rule would not have a significant economic impact and thus did not require a detailed cost-benefit analysis. Other regulators did perform extensive economic impact analyses in crafting the rule, and eventually so did the OCC. The Volcker Rule ultimately survived without a serious challenge in court. But given the new bill's potential to boost corporate lawsuits against regulation, it's not surprising that the Chamber of Commerce supports it.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified Foxx as a representative of Virginia; she represents North Carolina."

Analysts are now predicting what was almost unimaginable just a few years ago: China’s coal use could peak and begin to decline by 2020.That dramatic shift would put China on track to meet its treaty pledge of peaking total emissions in 2030. Falling demand for coal reflects strict new pollution controls, growing renewable energy use, and an economic shift away from coal-intensive infrastructure development.But hopes for a low-carbon economy also rest on precarious foundations. The same economic transformations that are reducing coal use -- steep declines in construction and industries like steel and concrete -- also threaten to stoke mounting social unrest, with massive factories shutting their doors and laid-off workers taking to the streets.If those strains grow too great, the Chinese government may return to its traditional fix-all for economic woes: massive stimulus spending on infrastructure projects that put people to work but further aggravate the country’s massive environmental challenges.At the crossroads of these transformations is the city of Tangshan, a polluted metropolis in the heart of China's rustbelt, 100 miles east of Beijing. Tangshan at times produces more steel than the entire United States, feeding a flourishing economy while also making it one of the most polluted cities in China. But today Tangshan has been hit hard by both economic transformation and pollution control: moribund steel markets have erased profits, and polluting factories have been shuttered to clear the air over neighboring Beijing.Liu Hongliang is native to the villages on the northern outskirts of Tangshan, and several years ago he and his wife put their savings together to open a restaurant. Surrounded on all sides by cement and steel factories, the place did brisk business feeding factory workers. But as the economic tides turned, those factories have shuttered en masse, drying up the income streams for Liu and his fellow villagers.“A few years ago you’d rush to the morning market because you were worried there wouldn’t be any meat left,” Liu recalled. “Now there aren’t any people left.”Tangshan resembles other Chinese cities in the proliferation of new shopping malls and low-end service jobs, but these shifts are outpacing many locals’ ability to adapt.“We’re farmers here but we’ve got no land,” Liu lamented. “Malls and stuff can’t use people like us, and the factories are shutting down.”Most worrying to the Chinese government has been a strong rise in labor unrest, with protests over layoffs often turning into direct confrontations with local police.The Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin has documented a sharp uptick in labor activism over the past year. While part of that can be attributed to better documentation of protests through social media, Geoffrey Crothall of CLB says many of the protests are driven by the wrenching economic transformations China is experiencing. Construction and coal mining have seen particularly steep increases in unrest in recent months, with disputes over unpaid wages escalating into violent confrontations.“In many of these disputes the workers involved are getting increasingly desperate,” said Crothall. “They’re pushing the boundaries a bit more and that’s leading to a more aggressive police response.”Roiling unrest from labor disputes could put the brakes on the rapid economic and environmental transformations the Chinese leadership hopes to engineer.“Whatever structural changes there are will have to happen slowly,” said Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research. “It will not happen in one or two years, and if there’s an economic slowdown the government will ... spend more money to build infrastructure. There’s no other way, I believe.”But analysts tracking Chinese coal markets for Greenpeace East Asia see encouraging signs of government resolve in 2014.“The leadership has resisted the urge to prop up growth with a new round of spending on infrastructure and industry,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, a coal researcher with Greenpeace. “That is very important going forward as it indicates the government is serious about rebalancing away from the dirtiest industries and is comfortable with trading some quantity for quality in the GDP numbers.”In another hopeful sign, Chinese media recently reported that the government planned to halt all new approvals for coal-to-gas projects, a carbon- and water-intensive industry that was previously marked for rapid expansion. Those changes are rippling through the country's markets and mines, with China imposing a blanket moratorium on new coal mines in eastern regions.Analysts see those measures playing into a constellation of new coal restrictions taking shape throughout the country. Twelve of China’s 34 provinces have already pledged to rein in coal use, and the central government is now calling for caps on coal consumption in the Yangtze and Pearl River Delta, regions that together burn more coal than the entire European Union. With those indicators all pointing in the right direction, Greenpeace is now calling for the Chinese government to codify the goal of peak coal in the years ahead.“We are optimistic that China's coal consumption will peak before 2020, and at least hopeful that this could also be made an official target,” said Myllyvirta."

Isaac is as wowed by the new âStar Wars: The Force Awakensâ trailer as its fans. Isaac, one of the stars of the upcoming film, said that the trailer was âpretty mind-blowingâ during an appearance at Monday nightâs Dec. 1, 2014 Gotham Independent Film Awards. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea449250000cf0037dae9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At the height of his struggle to survive in the lucrative but cutthroat heating oil industry during the most violent year in New York City history, Abel Morales exclaims: “I've spent my whole life trying not to become a gangster."" Morales, the lead character in J.C. Chandor's ""A Most Violent Year,"" is a Latino immigrant who makes the comment as his family life and business spiral out of control. Oscar Isaac, 35, (“Inside Llewyn Davis) portrays the righteous Morales, who faces the dark side of the American dream as his moral compass is set against his own ambition. The Guatemalan-born, Miami-raised Isaac has been busy with a diverse array of roles, including X-wing pilot Poe Dameron in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" a young artificial intelligence programmer in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,"" and a powerful villain in ""X-Men: Apocalypse."" ""A Most Violent Year"" is the first to hit theaters, with a nationwide release on Friday. Isaac spoke with The Huffington Post this week about the importance of portraying emotionally complex Latinos on the big screen and how he thinks ""Star Wars"" fans will react to J.J. Abrams' upcoming installment of the franchise. ""A Most Violent Year"" starts without much context on the characters or what’s going on. For most of the film, I couldn’t really figure out if Abel was as righteous as he pretended to be or not. What are your thoughts on Abel? Is he truly the same man he sets out to be in the beginning? I kind of don’t want to spoil it for you. It’s the kind of movie where you bring a lot to it as an audience member. In a way, I don’t want to limit it by interpretation of it. I think, that’s exactly the right question. That means I think the movie succeeded for you because that’s exactly what the whole movie is about. It’s about how do you navigate this system, this capitalist system. We’re all told, ‘In this country you gotta hustle to make it.’ So there’s hustling, cutting corners, doing things the other guy, your competitor, won’t do. And what you’re trying to do is navigate this crazy train particularly in a troubled time in New York’s history -- it was one of most violent years on record. So he does have this sickening ethical dilemma, where he wants to do things in certain way. He doesn’t want to be seen as a gangster, but I think that you’re right to question whether it’s really a moral thing or whether it’s actually just pragmatic.I also spoke with J.C. Chandor, who directed and wrote the film, about Abel and his American dream. He mentioned that Abel made it a point to “sand away"" his heritage to achieve his dream. He perfected his accent and changed his clothes, for example. That’s an interesting thing. I remember J.C. told me that with Henry Ford’s workers, one of the things that they would do is they would come in their Sunday’s finest, which was their ethnic clothes. They would come into this little melting pot and they would come out with a suit. And it was a way of [saying], 'And now you are an American.' You wear a suit and you go after the American dream.I think it’s a very good thing and it’s a modern thing that we try now to incorporate our culture. We try to make that just as much a part of America, as opposed to totally hiding it or denying it or turning your back on it.On that note, I recently saw in your interview with Vogue UK that you changed your last name from Hernández to Isaac because you wanted to avoid being typecast in stereotypical roles? That was my given name: Oscar Isaac Hernández. I felt that was little long for the marquee. [laughs] In Miami, that is an incredibly common name, Oscar Hernández. There are like 10 pages of Oscar Hernándezs in the phone book. And I was starting off in theater, there were actually a couple of other Oscars auditioning for parts as well. That was more of a differentiation from the people that were down there.At the same time, in Miami starting out it is difficult. You do get cast if you’re a Latin man, because you look a certain way. Casting directors, often -- it’s easy just to see people of a certain ethnicity as just one thing. For me it was important to be an actor, first and foremost. To me it was the most important thing, I wanted to be able to play anybody, and where I’m actually from to be secondary.There’s actually been a lot of contention in recent weeks in terms of diversity in Hollywood, and it was triggered by the fact that no actors of color were nominated for an Oscar this year. What are your thoughts on the subject?As far as awards distribution and why people get some and why they don’t -- for me, it’s just not something that I’m interested in pontificating about. I don’t really know or how you rectify that, other than people that make movies should make more of them. That’s one of the things that I loved about what J.C. did with this film, which is he made his hero an American of Latin American descent who is completely idiosyncratic, who is not a cliche, whose identity although much made up of where he comes from is just as much made up of who he is emotionally and psychologically and spiritually. The fact that he presented a Latin man not as a gangster, not as a sidekick, not as a villain, but as a powerful, flawed individual -- that’s a great thing. That helps audiences look at Latinos as more than just one thing. And switching gears completely, congratulations are in order. You’re going to have a huge role in the upcoming “X-Men: Apocalypse” and you’ll be playing an X-wing pilot Poe Dameron in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”Thank you.There is a lot of mystery surrounding the new ""Star Wars"" film. You’ve said you’ve “signed your organs away” and aren’t allowed to reveal any details. [laughs] Yeah, I can’t. So I won’t ask you details about the movie, but I will ask you one thing: The last three films weren’t received with as much fervor as the first three. So is ""The Force Awakens"" a movie that fans of the original 1980s trilogy will be happy with?Abso-frickin-lutely. Without question. I think particularly fans of the universe will just be in ecstasy. But I think that even people that haven’t -- there are believe it or not still people that haven’t seen or are not fans. I think this will win a lot of new fans. I just think it’s been done with such love, such energy, that it’ll be really compelling for everybody.

Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill, speaks during a ""United we Dream"" rally on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, July 10, 2013 in Washington. DREAMers (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors) gathers on Capitol Hill in a solemn and aspirational citizenship ceremony, sending a clear signal to the House of Representativesâ GOP leadership as they go into their meeting that afternoon to discuss immigration reform with their caucus. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e69e2600002d0183bfa0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As undocumented immigrants prepare to apply for President Barack Obama's new deportation relief programs, they're also facing a barrage of concerning news. House Republicans voted to end the policies. Senate Republicans are aiming to do the same. Twenty-six states sued the federal government, hoping to block Obama's programs from going into effect, and the House is considering filing a suit as well.It's enough to make some undocumented immigrants nervous -- and some advocates think that's the intention. Their goal now is to convince immigrants that it's safe to come forward.""The lawsuits and legislation are partly about scaring immigrants into not coming forward and partly about pandering to the deportation-only wing of the Republican party,"" Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) said in an emailed statement. He added, ""The law is clearly on the president’s side, and I think the courts will agree.""Obama announced a series of executive actions in November that could allow up to 5 million people to stay in the U.S. and work legally, focused on people who came to the U.S. as children and on those who are parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. Republicans have said the policies are unconstitutional and an overreach of Obama's authority, and are taking steps to block them. The House voted earlier this month to tie measures to end the president's immigration policies to a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Friday that it will get a vote in the upper chamber next week. The White House has threatened a veto, but the bill won't get to the president's desk to begin with. The entire Senate Democratic caucus voiced support this week for keeping immigration measures out of a DHS funding bill, and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters on Friday that Democrats plan to block the bill from going forward next week. ""Our goal is to keep the Democrats united and make it clear to Sen. McConnell and the Senate Republicans that this House approach is unacceptable,"" Durbin told reporters on a call hosted by the pro-immigration reform group America's Voice. Supporters of the executive actions also think they will prevail in the courts, even if there are short-term setbacks. A judge is set to issue a first ruling soon on the lawsuit from 26 states contending Obama's actions were unconstitutional. Marshall Fitz, the vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, told reporters on Friday that advocates expect the judge's ""personal bias"" will lead to him ruling in favor of the states, but that an appeals court -- or, if it went that far, the Supreme Court -- would determine the executive actions were constitutional. ""As a federal district judge, he does have the power to slow the process down, but he's not going to be the final arbiter of the legality of the president's actions,"" he said on the America's Voice call. ""And we are extremely confident that at the end of the judicial process these actions will ultimately be upheld as constitutional and that they will go into effect."" There is no set start date for the policy for parents, although it's not expected for a few months. The expanded DACA policy will begin accepting applications on Feb. 18. Advocates are trying to get people ready to apply as soon as the process begins. Their reasoning is that the more people apply, the harder it will be to take the policy away. Then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott (R), now the governor, said as much in December when announcing the states' lawsuit against Obama. ""It will be difficult or impossible to undo the president’s lawlessness after the defendants start granting applications for deferred action,"" he said in a statement at the time. Lorella Praeli, advocacy and policy director for United We Dream, said ""the best way to fight Republicans' attempts"" to block the programs is to make sure people apply. ""What has become evident to us is that the Republican party's overall strategy with regards to the executive action on immigration is to create kind of a chilling effect so that people don't come forward and apply,"" Praeli said. Members of Congress have been involved in the effort as well. In Nevada, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's (D) office has distributed flyers that instruct immigrants on how to prepare to apply for relief, including how to request any immigration files they might have with DHS by using a Freedom of Information Act request. Gutierrez has been holding workshops around the country to spread the word about the deferred action programs. His Saturday event in Chicago is set to be the biggest: DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, Sen. Dick Durbin (R-Ill.), Mayor Rahm Emanuel and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Leon Rodriguez are also slated to attend, according to the congressman's office. Laura Vazquez, an immigration legislative analyst for the National Council of La Raza, said the community-based organizations the group works for are seeing a lot of interest in the executive actions, but also some concerns. She said they are trying to communicate that it's safe to apply for executive action. NCLR sent an email from Vazquez to its network earlier this month: ""Don’t be afraid; this bill is not a law and applications for administrative relief will be coming out in the next few months. Don’t let these recent actions deter you from preparing to apply for relief."""
12,COLLEGE,UVA Students Say Banning Sorority Members From Frat Parties Is 'Dangerous',Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uva-sorority-party-ban_n_6581704.html,,2015-01-31,"The Rotunda stands under renovation on the University of Virginia (UVA) campus in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S., on Friday, Jan. 16, 2015. This year's rush week at UVA, the prolonged annual rite in which fraternities and sororities recruit new members, carries fresh significance. Depending on who you talk to, the student rituals embody either an unchecked culture of sexual violence or a community victimized by stigma and false accusations. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae551b240000510054e367.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many students at the University of Virginia think banning sorority members from attending parties celebrating the end of fraternity recruitment this weekend could backfire on the national sorority organizations that issued the restriction. In fact, some students suggest that the ban could even put students at risk, because sorority women trained in sexual assault prevention won't be able to go to the bid night events. Fraternities could also host unregistered -- and therefore largely unregulated -- events at a later date instead.""Every sorority woman is trained in bystander intervention,"" said sophomore Abraham Axler, who is on the executive board of UVA's student council. He is referring to the sexual assault prevention strategy of stepping in to stop a potentially risky situation. To remove sorority women from fraternity events, Axler said, ""seems dangerous.""The presidents of the national sorority organizations reaffirmed Thursday that they would not budge on a controversial directive banning undergraduate members from fraternity parties during bid night this weekend. They say the rule is meant to protect female students' ""safety and well-being."" If caught at one of the events, sorority members would likely face a fine from their organization, or the entire chapter could be banned from hosting its own social events.Sororities contend that they have always restricted members from fraternity recruitment events, said Timothy M. Burke, an attorney with Fraternal Law Partners, which counts the National Panhellenic Conference, an umbrella group for all 26 sororities nationally, among its clients. However, UVA senior Story Hinckley said that the bid night parties celebrate the end of recruitment and aren't recruitment events. ""They're deciding that all of a sudden on Sunday, the fraternities are safe and men are not rapists, but throughout the day and night Saturday it's unsafe,"" she said. ""It's really confusing and strange.""Burke sided with students who argued that frat parties may be even safer than other campus gatherings because of the rules and education programs put in place for members. ""[Fraternity parties are] no more dangerous than the rugby team's parties, for example, and frankly, the national men's groups and the national women's groups are both conducting a great deal of educational programming for their chapters, designed to help them conduct parties safely,"" Burke said. ""Those kinds of safety measures are not being done for other student groups, generally.""The national sororities have all declined this week to respond to the criticism from students. Tracey Vitters, chair of the nonprofit Students Active For Ending Rape, an advocacy organization against sexual violence and rape culture, criticized the message being sent by the ban. ""Really, the conversation should be less about telling women 'Don't go to this party,' and more about the NPC reaching across the aisle to the fraternities and saying 'You need to do better.'"" "

Don't think you'll find fun in Yangon using Tinder, the dating app that's popular elsewhere.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6004c2400005000569627.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recent talk about young women and sex has centered around the ""hookup culture,"" and how millennials are forgoing serious relationships in favor of casual hookups; sleeping with men but not dating them; and taking a laissez-faire approach to romance. In many ways, this shift makes sense: In a competitive, media-driven world where news is reduced to sound bites and anything we want can be delivered to our doorstop tomorrow, why not be as efficient as possible when it comes to romance, too? Hooking up -- for both men and women -- makes sense for our modern society. It's about satisfying a physical need, and that's that. Mobile apps like Tinder and The Grade have made hookup culture prominent by making hooking up more accessible. Tinder is on-demand, instant gratification interaction with a potential partner: Swipe through photos, see one that strikes your fancy, and ""like"" him or her. If he or she ""likes"" you back, the app connects you. The ease and low risk factor are two reasons the more than 50 million active users on Tinder check their accounts as much as 11 times per day. But in addition to making hooking up easier, these apps have also made hooking up a far more equal opportunity. In fact, you could argue that for women, hooking up in the information age is the safest and most liberating it's ever been. Expressing interest in someone on Tinder is not much different from doing so at a bar, except that you also have a chance to pre-screen: Most apps allow users the ability to see if you have mutual friends -- which, of course, could be built-in references -- and shared interests. You're also spared having to deliver, or hear, any awkward pickup lines, never a bad thing. But perhaps the best part: No unsolicited suitors. On most dating sites -- and certainly in bars -- anyone can message you, or try to spark up a conversation. With Tinder, only someone you've ""liked"" can make contact. College-age people often say theirs is a generation that is interested in efficiency and ease. They already feel comfortable online, and they know what to look for -- and look out for. This sort of pre-screening and early stage anonymity is very appealing -- and safe. Of course, the comfort level this generation feels is what might also be considered the greatest risk to mobile app dating: Because interacting feels so natural, it may be easier to let your guard down with people who are, let's not forget, strangers. But it's nothing that this generation hasn't been warned about when it comes to the Internet. Like with other aspects of life, social media doesn't change the way people date, but instead helps facilitate practices and habits already in place. The intention and the outcome, after all, are the same: Find a mate. And like anything else, hooking up in the information age is all about portion control -- and using mobile apps for healthy reasons and in healthy doses. Some days, it may be for physical satisfaction. On others, it may be about finding romance. Really, that's no different from more old-fashioned approaches to meeting people. Sometimes you really do have to kiss a lot of frogs to find your prince, if a prince is what you want. That said, you don't want to be kissing frogs all day, every day; just because mobile apps make connecting easier doesn't mean you should do so at the expense of everything else in your life. (Which, it could be argued, people already know. Indeed, there's reason to believe that the pervasiveness of hookup culture is likely greatly exaggerated. A study presented at the recent annual meeting of the American Sociological Association found that just under one-third of college students have had more than one partner in the past year -- a number comparable to rates in 1988, 1996, 2002, and 2010. Which means that hooking up has not replaced committed relationships.)Is there a risk that, in the time of Tinder, people start to take dating and hooking up less seriously? Sure, if you believe that having easier access to things makes people callous, which I'm not sure it does. But let's remember that dating is supposed to be fun. The math is pretty simple: In the end, what social media dating does is give users -- and, most poignantly -- women more options. And more options means more freedom, and more power, too."

It was unclear exactly how long the bridge would be, but the strait varies from around 4-15 km in width (2.5-9 miles).The government order said the project should be completed no later than December 2018 and described SGM as ""one of Russia's leading holding companies engaged in the construction of oil and gas, transport and maritime sectors.""It did not say how much the project was worth but Kommersant newspaper, which published an interview with Rotenberg on Friday, said it was costed a few months ago at 228.3 billion roubles ($3.3 billion at the current rate).SGM saw revenues surge after its creation in 2008 from units from state-controlled gas company Gazprom.According to the U.S. Treasury, Rotenberg and his brother Boris have won billions of dollars from projects awarded to them by Putin.The Rotenberg brothers deny getting help from the Russian leader for their businesses.Forbes magazine puts Arkady Rotenberg's fortune at $1.8 billion, making him Russia's 27th richest person.""IMPORTANT FOR COUNTRY""He welcomed the decision in the interview with Kommersant but said the project would probably be his last after he long ago decided to leave management, selling some of his businesses to his son.""At 63 I think more about what should be left behind, what will be the results of life,"" he said.""Moreover, I long planned to gradually stop running businesses ... But the bridge project came along and I decided it was very important to carry it out. It is important for the country.""Rotenberg, Putin's childhood judo partner, is among a number of friends and allies of Putin who have been at his side for many years and are now wealthy businessmen or top politicians.The Kremlin says contracts are awarded by fair tenders and that Putin's associates are not shown any favoritism.Rotenberg said Turkish and South Korean companies could take part in the construction of the bridge from Russia's Krasnodar region.It would be crucial in increasing Russian traffic to Crimea. At the moment Russian vehicles can only enter Crimea by being ferried into its port.Rotenberg also shrugged off any possible new condemnation from the West - which does not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea - as a result of the project, saying he had no plans to leave Russia and that his businesses were also based at home.Italian authorities seized property, including an apartment in Sardinia and a hotel in Rome, worth about 30 million euros ($34 million) belonging to Rotenberg's companies in September.""But yes, expansion abroad for me is closed, but this is not terrible,"" he said.

Because their 20th-century business model, built around a centralized, command-and-control electric grid, is increasingly outdated in an age when we can produce power on individual rooftops from ubiquitous sunshine and manage energy individually on ubiquitous smartphones. If we can overcome the roadblocks being thrown up by monopoly utilities, that $48 billion can go right into the pockets of utility customers in a more democratic energy system. Read on for an explanation of how we can achieve energy democracy out of the turmoil of today's electricity system.A System Under StressThe following timeline explains the changes being wrought to the U.S. electricity system in the context of its 100-year history.There have been three waves of change crashing over the electric utility system in the past 50 years: Shock & Competition, Deregulation, and Transition. The third wave, powered by distributed renewable energy and stagnant energy demand and aided by state regulation, isn't going to recede.Already, The Wall Street Journal notes that the era of growing electricity sales is likely over.Not only is demand falling, but competition from renewable energy sources is growing. In the past few years, that competition isn't just from other large power producers, but from utility customers themselves (see the growth of ""small solar"" in particular (and red), representing residential and commercial installations 1 megawatt and smaller).The $48 Billion Question for a New Business ModelUtilities haven't given up in the face of this threat. In fact, they're often actively fighting it while they continue to invest in the infrastructure for last century's grid (read more in our report).These battles are the origin of ""Utility 2.0,"" a business model discussion inside and outside of utilities that would allow electric companies to accommodate flat energy demand and rising customer energy production.

Because their 20th-century business model, built around a centralized, command-and-control electric grid, is increasingly outdated in an age when we can produce power on individual rooftops from ubiquitous sunshine and manage energy individually on ubiquitous smartphones. If we can overcome the roadblocks being thrown up by monopoly utilities, that $48 billion can go right into the pockets of utility customers in a more democratic energy system. Read on for an explanation of how we can achieve energy democracy out of the turmoil of today's electricity system.A System Under StressThe following timeline explains the changes being wrought to the U.S. electricity system in the context of its 100-year history.There have been three waves of change crashing over the electric utility system in the past 50 years: Shock & Competition, Deregulation, and Transition. The third wave, powered by distributed renewable energy and stagnant energy demand and aided by state regulation, isn't going to recede.Already, The Wall Street Journal notes that the era of growing electricity sales is likely over.Not only is demand falling, but competition from renewable energy sources is growing. In the past few years, that competition isn't just from other large power producers, but from utility customers themselves (see the growth of ""small solar"" in particular (and red), representing residential and commercial installations 1 megawatt and smaller).The $48 Billion Question for a New Business ModelUtilities haven't given up in the face of this threat. In fact, they're often actively fighting it while they continue to invest in the infrastructure for last century's grid (read more in our report).These battles are the origin of ""Utility 2.0,"" a business model discussion inside and outside of utilities that would allow electric companies to accommodate flat energy demand and rising customer energy production. It's good policy, focused on shifting the principles of the electricity system to a low-carbon, flexible, and efficient one as well as shifting utility incentives to achieve these outcomes.But Utility 2.0 will prove inadequate if it remains indifferent to the flow of energy dollars out of communities (the $48 billion question).Already, 500,000 U.S. homes sport solar energy and it gets more affordable every year. Rooftop solar, smartphones, and widespread energy storage will give utility customers unprecedented opportunity to control their energy usage, and to capture their share of the nation's energy dollars. A 2.0 utility business model that doesn't accommodate this opportunity for local, equitable access to energy production and management will leave many U.S. electricity consumers deeply unsatisfied.Energy DemocracyThat's the central point of Utility 3.0, or as we call it, energy democracy.

It saw ""quite a number of incidents"" of backlash in January.""There are still communities that think, for instance, Ebola is spreading with spraying chlorine, disinfecting of the houses, and it is the Red Cross team that are coming with the chlorine, so they are making that connection,"" she said.To de-escalate tensions, the Red Cross is sending police and authorities a day in advance to prepare villages for the arrival of its teams, she said.""If we don't get full access in Guinea, then we definitely risk that this will become something permanent. If it's permanent in Guinea, then we know also that it will be in the whole region, because there are porous borders,"" Hald said.The number of new confirmed Ebola cases totalled 99 in the week to Jan. 25, the lowest tally since June, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, signaling the tide might have turned against the epidemic.. The outbreak has killed 8,810 people out of 22,092 known cases.Some 27 sub-prefectures in Guinea reported at least one security incident or other form of refusal to cooperate in the week to Jan 21. Two districts in Liberia and four in Sierra Leone reported at least one similar incident, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said on Friday.The decline in new cases should not lead to complacency, she said: ""Because one unsafe burial - only one - can really create a new chain of transmission and cause other cases of Ebola.""(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Larry King) Like Us On Facebook   Follow Us On Twitter  "

(Photo by Chelsea Lauren/Getty Images for Sundance)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4a0d11f00002e0124223e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Halfway through ""The Overnight,"" Adam Scott and Jason Schwartzman get naked. Very naked. We say ""very"" not only because the scene is revealing, but because it's a slow burn to get there. In the comedy, which premiered to rave reviews at the Sundance Film Festival, Schwartzman plays a free-spirited artist who invites an anxious couple he meets at the neighborhood park (Scott and Taylor Schilling) to his palatial Los Angeles home for a playdate. When he and his wife (Judith Godrèche) suggest they put the kids to bed and have their own playtime, the night devolves into a series of oddities, all compounded by increasing amounts of alcohol and weed. One such curiosity involves Schwartzman's character convincing Scott's to let go of the self-consciousness he feels about his tiny penis and skinny-dip with the others. Scott made sure to emphasize during the Q&A following the movie's world premiere that he and Schwarztman, who guest-starred on ""Parks and Recreation"" in 2013, wore prosthetic genitals for the film. Given the culture of Sexy Sundance, when HuffPost Entertainment sat down with the actors in Park City, Utah, the next day, we had to lead with talk of prancing around nude in Patrick Brice's movie. ""The Overnight,"" which Scott and his wife, Naomi, produced with Mark and Jay Duplass, sold to The Orchard with plans for a release later this year. In the meantime, put this comedy on your radar -- it was one of Sundance's best, and now you can watch Schwartzman take a bong hit knowing he needed a major tutorial about the ""lighter part.""The movie premiered only yesterday, but surely all of these interviews are about your prosthetic penises. On a scale of 1 to 10, how tired are you of talking about them?Schwartzman: 10 being what?Fucking over it.Schwartzman: Zero. I’m happy to talk about it. It’s weird, I haven’t talked about prosthetic genitals all year.Scott: Might as well get it all in.Schwartzman: Yeah, I have lots to talk about. Today’s the day. What was your initial reaction to the script's nudity requirements?Schwartzman: There are two reactions happening simultaneously. One is, ""How are we going to do this? What is this? What is happening? Technically, what happens?"" Then, as a reader and a follower of the story, which is that, ""Wow, this plot has elevated itself to a new level. It’s gone to a new place."" And I think that’s the most important thing. When my character goes skinny-dipping, that’s sort of the moment in the movie where we realize we’re in for something a little more. More than what the other couple bargained for, certainly.Schwartzman: Exactly. I’m sure there’s people who go and eat food and then maybe smoke pot and dance and stuff. I don’t really go to those types of thing, so if there was a lot of pot-smoking and stuff, it already would have been like, ""Well, this is an unusual night."" But not for most. Once I’m asking him to take off his shirt when we’re taking pictures, that could also just be like, ""This is my art, this is what I do."" But I think once you take off your pants, it’s the statement that this is going to be a different kind of evening. But then Adam, when he takes off his, that’s more of a character breakthrough, so they kind of have different functions. What's it like applying these prosthetics?Scott: It’s pretty much like any other prosthetic. You just glue it on, apply makeup and it sort of blends. There’s no real salaciousness. You have to shave a little bit so the glue sticks well. And we’re swimming around in a pool, so it had to be waterproof.Were there any hiccups with that?Schwartzman: There weren’t with the glue, but with that prosthetic, once we were naked in the beautifully warmed pool, we didn’t really want to get out of it. The only hiccup came when, after five hours in the pool, the prosthetics were a bit more waterlogged. They had gotten heavier.Scott: Oh yeah! It was filled with water.Schwartzman: You know those little dinosaur things you can buy? They’re like this big, you put them in water and then two days later they’re like a stegosaurus? That’s sort of what happened. Was there any pride or insecurity with getting to play these two roles?Schwartzman: Not really, I didn’t think like, ""Oh, I have this big prosthetic, I feel great right now."" My confidence didn’t change once the prosthetic was on me, deep down. My mind never went there. Scott: I remember when I first read it, I was like, ""Why do I have to play the guy with the tiny dick?""Did you ever ask anybody that question?Scott: No, I didn’t, but I started really thinking about it and I was like, ""Huh, this character’s really going through something interesting."" And what does a tiny dick mean? What does it mean to him? And what does everyone else think about it? That was really interesting. Schwartzman: And his wife.Scott: It’s funny, though. My knee-jerk reaction was what you said: I wonder what Mark Duplass, who was like, ""Hey, maybe you should play this part,"" thought here.You both play increasing levels of drunk and stoned very well, particularly you, Adam, since your character is a relative novice. You seem like a pro.Scott: No, I don’t drink and we certainly weren’t smoking pot on set.Schwartzman: Patrick had to show me how to smoke out of a bong. I had no idea. He handed me the thing and was like, “And then just take a big, massive bong hit.” Then he walked away and I was like, “How do you do the massive bong hit? I don’t know how to do that. Can you demonstrate?”What was everyone's reaction to that?Schwartzman: I don’t think it was like, “Whaaaat?” Scott: There were plenty of people who could show you how to do it expertly. Schwartzman: If there was ever a set where there was a bong-hit technician, that was the set. People knew what they were doing. It’s hard to take a bong hit. I’m not a huge man. That bong was half the size of my body.Scott: It was giant.Schwartzman: I didn’t even have the arm span to reach the lighter part. I don’t even know what to call the lighter part. ""I don’t know how to do the lighter part of the bong!""You're both married with children. Do you respond to the restlessness these characters are feeling now that they're full steam ahead in the parenting process?Schwartzman: Obviously there’s reality to always appraising your situation. That’s a part of life and marriage, and that’s what’s great about it. More what I kind of hooked onto was this idea of being a certain age and then, through your kids and your living circumstances, maybe having to make new friends. And what is that? They meet at a park through the kids. Playdates, I can totally relate to. Going to someone’s house for dinner that I don’t even know? I would never go to someone’s house that I don’t know for dinner. Scott: Ugh. What a bummer. Schwartzman: I cannot imagine. If either of you guys walked up to me like that, I would be in hell. All day long, I’d be like, “I think I’m getting ill, I have a fever.”  Scott: “I can’t just watch ‘The Bachelor’ in my underwear?""Schwartzman: Oh, I know.

(AP Photo/ Saudi Press Agency)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1449124000033003829b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The palace coup is complete. In a far-reaching decree on Thursday night, the new Saudi king Salman unraveled the legacy of his half-brother Abdullah and set the kingdom on course for a significant regional realignment. A possible rapprochement with Turkey and Qatar, a return to the traditional role Saudi Arabia has occupied as mediator between Fatah and Hamas, and a qualitative change in the support Riyadh has given the military rulers of Egypt are all now on the table.Blowing away the cobwebs also means dealing with the spider. Prince Bandar bin Sultan has been stripped of his last remaining role as head of the National Security Council. This, one senses, really is the end of the line for Bandar, and the region will be all the more stable for it. Abdullah's two sons, Prince Mishaal bin Abdullah, who is the governor of Mecca, and Prince Turki, who governed the capital Riyadh, have been dismissed. Abdullah's only son left in power is Prince Muteb, who stays as head of the National Guard. There is no love lost in this family. A conservative cleric, Saad al-Shethri, who backed gender segregation in higher education, has become Salman's personal adviser. But a balance has been struck with the addition of the new information minister, Adel al-Toraifi, a young liberal who is a former head of Al Arabiya news channel.The two men to emerge with the power to run the country are Mohammed bin Nayef, the deputy crown prince, and Salman's son Mohammed, who now has three roles: defense minister, general secretary to the royal court, and president of the newly formed Council of Economic and Development Affairs. Another Salman son, Abdulaziz, is deputy petroleum minister. The second generation has now been firmly secured by the Sudairi clan.Salman started his reign by buying the love of his people, the same thing the late King Abdullah tried to do during the first months of the Arab Spring. All state employees will receive two months of bonus salary, and all retired state employees will receive two months of bonus pension. Students who receive state grants and those on social security will get two months of extra funds as well. The bill comes to a mere $30 billion.""Dear people: You deserve more and whatever I do I would not be able to give you what you deserve,"" the newly inaugurated monarch said on Twitter, just a few weeks after Riyadh signaled it would have to cut back on public spending because of the oil-price crash. Salman was retweeted 250,000 times.King Salman has had rave reviews. All manner of former opponent of King Abdullah are now singing Salman's praises. Informed Saudi observers note that King Abdullah became dogmatic in his last years. Salman, for them, marks a return to the moderation of King Fahd.The new king stressed continuity, but his first seven days in power have been anything but. And the gear change will be noted first abroad. In a world in which personal relations play out in politics, it is important to remember who Salman's and Bin Nayef's friends are.King Salman has remained close to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, the emir of Qatar, so the threat that Saudi Arabia made last year to lay siege to its tiny neighbor or have it expelled from the Gulf Cooperative Council now looks like a bad memory. Similarly, bin Nayef is close to senior Turkish officials, Saudi sources tell me. The rift between Turkey and Saudi Arabia after the Arab revolutions of 2011 will have pained him, not just because the two regional powers need each other to contain Iran's expanded influence in Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon and Syria but personally. It is likely that he will repair that rift.It is also payback time for bin Nayef's personal enemies. The interior minister has still not forgotten that two-hour conversation that the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed, had with Richard Hass 12 years ago, which we know about courtesy of WikiLeaks. Speaking about bin Nayef's father, who was the Saudi interior minister at the time, the Emirati prince observed that Darwin's theory that man was descended from the apes was correct. Bin Nayef, the son, has more recent scores to settle with Abu Dhabi's ruler. Erem News, which, like every Emirati news outlet, is controlled by the royal court, questioned bin Nayef's appointment as deputy crown prince. Saying that Salman failed to consult the Allegiance Council, the UAE mouthpiece noted, ""The mechanism of choosing Mohammad Bin Nayef from among several prominent grandsons has attracted the attention of observers."" This was not a casual post. An Egyptian TV anchor, Yousef Al-Hosseini, tried the same thing on as soon as Abdullah's latest illness became known. According to Arab Secrets, this was part of a campaign masterminded by the ousted Khaled al-Tuwaijri, Abdullah's confidant, to keep Prince Meteb lined up for the role of deputy crown prince. The website named the route through which the anchor's script was dictated, from the Saudi royal court through to Sisi's office manager, Abbas Kamil, the man who has been secretly recorded asking for the satirist Bassim Yousef to be taken off the air.Tuwaijri, Bandar and bin Zayed ran out of time. The king died before a serious challenge to Salman could be mounted. And now two of them, at least, are yesterday's men. We will watch with interest what happens to the third. This food chain of intrigue from Riyadh to Cairo is likely to be broken.The changes taking place in the Saudi royal palace are already having their effect. Bin Zayed stayed away from Abdullah's funeral, as did the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. And just at the time when Sisi needs a fresh injection of Saudi cash, Egypt is more unstable than ever, with full-scale military operations in the Sinai and mass protests around the country that never seem to die down. The Egyptian Pound is at an all-time low. The options for Sisi appear to be narrowing. This is not a good time for the Egyptian army to lose its chief bankroller in Riyadh, but this now is a real possibility. Even if bin Nayef decides to keep the funds going -- and there was always a difference between funds promised and hard cash received -- it may now come with strings attached. The policy of declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization may also be about to change. Salman himself received Sheikh Rached Ghannouchi, the leader of Ennadha, in his condolences for the late king. This is the most senior Islamist to be welcomed in Saudi Arabia. The removal of Suleiman Ab Al-Khail as the minister of endowments and Islamic affairs, who was an arch opponent of the Brotherhood, is another sign that the policy might be about to change.Even if it doesn't, the outcome of the earthquake this week in Saudi Arabia will be received with quiet satisfaction by senior foreign office officials who bridled at David Cameron's launching of an inquiry into the Brotherhood in Britain, which was done under Saudi and Emirati pressure. Up until Salman took over, the inquiry headed by Sir John Jenkins has proved to be a political embarrassment. It has been unpublishable because it came to the ""wrong"" conclusion, clearing the Brotherhood of any involvement in terrorism in Egypt. Now the new masters of Riyadh might even welcome such a conclusion."
21,POLITICS,Joe Biden Twists Data,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-us-economy_n_6579012.html,,2015-01-30,"US Vice President Joe Biden addresses the first Caribbean Energy Security Summit in Washington, DC on January 26, 2015. AFP PHOTO/NICHOLAS KAMM (Photo credit should read NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e6592500008e013a58dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org.Biden twisted international data on economic growth when he said the U.S. is “the only country in the world expected to continue to grow.” India, China and several Asian nations are expected to grow much faster than the U.S., just not as fast as they have in past years.Overall, the U.S. gross domestic product is expected to grow at a faster rate than the world average in 2015, but a little slower than the world average in 2016 and 2017.Putting his spin on the nation’s economic recovery during a speech at the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Jan. 22, Biden argued that an international comparison is in order (at the 18:10 mark).Biden, Jan. 22: Listen to what the international community says. International Monetary Fund — every year rates what they expect the growth rate to be in the world, country by country. [The U.S. is] the only country in the world expected to continue to grow. They estimate growth rates at over 3.6 percent in the next two years. Every other part of the world, all of our competitors — their growth rate is being cut in half or is below zero. China, Europe — that’s not good for us. We want them to grow.The following day, during a speech in Los Angeles, Biden reiterated the point (at the 7:40 mark).Biden, Jan. 23: We are … better positioned than any nation in the world to lead the world economically. Look at the numbers. Look at the World Bank projections. Look at the IMF projections. We’re the only nation in the world where we’re projected to grow significantly. Every other nation’s going to have their GDP cut significantly. The Chinese it’s been predicted to be cut in half of what it was in the previous 15 years. That’s not a good thing; we want them to grow.While the comments give the distinct impression that U.S. GDP growth is outpacing every other country, and that the U.S. is the only country with a growing GDP, that’s not the case at all.Let’s go to the two sources listed by Biden, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.In a news release on Jan. 19, the IMF announced updates to its World Economic Outlook from its forecast in October 2014. Those updated projections showed the U.S. economic outlook had improved since its last report, and in fact with regard to GDP, “the United States is the only major economy for which growth projections have been raised.” The IMF cited the declining unemployment rate, appreciation of the dollar and a decline in oil prices for the upgraded forecast for the U.S.IMF, Jan. 19: Among major advanced economies, growth in the United States rebounded ahead of expectations after the contraction in the first quarter of 2014, and unemployment declined further, while inflation pressure stayed more muted, also reflecting the dollar appreciation and the decline in oil prices. Growth is projected to exceed 3 percent in 2015–16, with domestic demand supported by lower oil prices, more moderate fiscal adjustment, and continued support from an accommodative monetary policy stance, despite the projected gradual rise in interest rates.But that doesn’t mean the economies of all other countries are not growing. Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the U.K., India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa will all see an increase in GDP year over year, but the updated projections show their economies won’t increase as much as projected in October.Nor does it mean there aren’t countries whose GDP is expected to grow faster than the U.S. In fact, even as the IMF downgraded the GDP forecast of major economies outside the U.S., the overall global growth of GDP was projected at 3.5 percent in 2015 and 3.7 percent in 2016 — tracking the projected GDP growth in the U.S.Biden is correct that China’s GDP growth is well below where it was in the 2000s, but the latest forecast of GDP growth in China — 6.8 percent in 2015 and 6.3 percent in 2016, according to IMF forecasts — is still nearly double the growth rate projected for the U.S.The U.S. has the world’s largest economy, with a GDP of $17.5 trillion in 2014, followed by China ($10 trillion), Japan ($4.8 trillion), Germany ($3.9 trillion), France ($2.9 trillion), U.K. ($2.8 trillion), Brazil ($2.2 trillion), Italy ($2.2 trillion), Russia ($2.1 trillion) and India ($2 trillion).Data on GDP from the World Bank presents a similar picture to the IMF. According to the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report, the world’s economic prospects are expected to improve in 2015, but the report warned that some trends present some “downside risk.”World Bank, Jan. 13: Underneath the fragile global recovery lie increasingly divergent trends with significant implications for global growth. Activity in the United States and the United Kingdom is gathering momentum as labor markets heal and monetary policy remains extremely accommodative. But the recovery has been sputtering in the Euro Area and Japan as legacies of the financial crisis linger. China, meanwhile, is undergoing a carefully managed slowdown with growth slowing to a still-robust 7.1 percent this year (7.4 percent in 2014), 7 percent in 2016 and 6.9 percent in 2017. And the oil price collapse will result in winners and losers.Overall, the World Bank stated, “After growing by an estimated 2.6 percent in 2014, the global economy is projected to expand by 3 percent this year, 3.3 percent in 2016 and 3.2 percent in 2017.”As the accompanying chart shows, the World Bank expects GDP growth in the U.S. to do slightly better than the world average in 2015 (3.2 percent in the U.S. versus 3.0 percent for the world). But in 2016 and 2017, the World Bank projects the GDP growth for the U.S. will lag the world average.As for China, it’s true that GDP growth has been more rapid in years past, with a peak of 14.2 percent in 2007. But the projected growth rate in China is still more than double the growth rate for the U.S. As the report noted, China is “undergoing a carefully managed slowdown” but growth is at a “still robust” 7.1 percent in 2015.Biden is correct that the U.S. economy is outperforming most major competitors, particularly those in Europe. But it’s an exaggeration to say the growth rates for European countries have been cut in half.The IMF downgraded its forecast for GDP growth in the European nations of Germany, France, Italy and Spain to 1.2 percent in 2015. That’s 0.2 percentage points lower than it had projected in October. And while there have been a few instances of countries seeing a net decline in GDP in 2015 (such as Russia), most are projected to improve, just not as quickly as the U.S. But in the case of India (which is projected to see 6.3 percent growth in 2015), China and several Asian nations, the growth rate — even with downgraded forecasts — is expected to be much higher than in the U.S."

(AP Photo/Aaron Favila)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1448a240000500024fac3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Don't get me wrong, Francis. You seem like a sincere, congenial man, and I admire you for bringing the world's attention to the need to address poverty, fight climate change, and eliminate inequality. But, sadly, your unwillingness to accept access to the full range of contraceptives as a necessary and moral good is completely incompatible with your efforts to make the world a better place. You see, modern contraceptive methods--like the birth control pill, condom, and intrauterine device--do much more than provide people with a healthy sex life. Contraception saves lives, especially those of women and girls living in the developing world, who often don't have access to antenatal services. Mothers and babies die when women aren't able to delay, space, or avoid pregnancies. And young children whose mothers die in pregnancy or childbirth are more likely to die themselves. Incredibly, if all women in the developing world who want to avoid pregnancy used modern contraception, the number of unintended pregnancies would drop by 70 percent and unsafe abortions would fall by 74 percent. The ability to plan one's family provides women and girls with more educational and job opportunities. And many economies would get a much-needed boost. There is no doubt that universal access to contraception would bring us closer to achieving economic and gender equality in one fell swoop. Imagine that!But, Francis, providing people with access to the full range of contraceptives is also crucial to combatting climate change. If you're serious about engaging in this work, you simply must end your proscription of modern birth control. Though the population-climate link is based on science, it's not rocket science. And your defense of the Church's ban on modern contraception--less than a week after you stated that ""the majority"" of climate change is caused by humans and after years of calling for climate action--is mind-boggling. Modern-day contraceptives are extremely effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly. And preventing unintended pregnancy helps to slow population growth--one of the leading causes of climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions. According to a 2010 study, leveling the world population at 8 billion, instead of the projected 9 billion, by 2050 could provide 16 to 29 percent of the emissions reductions required to prevent dangerous climate change. It would have a much greater impact than if global deforestation were completely eliminated. And while most of the world's climate pollution is being emitted from industrialized nations--namely, the United States--the fastest population growth is happening in developing countries--some of which, like Mexico and the Philippines, have a majority Catholic population. In fact, roughly 16 percent of the world population practices Catholicism, and the religion is growing fastest in Africa--the continent with the most rapid population growth. Francis, that means nearly one-sixth (and growing) of the world population acknowledges your teachings. Nearly a sixth of the people on Earth have been told, by you, that it is a sin to use modern contraception. And all of them will contribute to and be affected by climate change. Therefore, you have a responsibility to ensure that your followers have all the tools they need--including contraception--to reduce their carbon output and strengthen their resilience to the inevitable effects of climate change. For many people around the world--especially women and girls living in poverty-stricken countries--having the ability to prevent unwanted pregnancies means they have a better chance at coping with extreme weather events. That's because families who are able to plan the birth of their children are likely to have more resources and, as a result, are more able to respond to changes in their environment.Surely some of the families that you visited during your recent trip to the Philippines would have been better equipped to withstand the effects of super-typhoon Haiyan if they had access to contraceptives. It is largely due to the influence of the country's Catholic Bishops that 90 percent of the unintended pregnancies--half of all pregnancies there--are the result of a lack of modern contraception.Planning and preventing pregnancy is not only a personal choice; it's a human right that saves lives, combats poverty, and helps to close the inequality gap. But more than that it's a crucial requirement for slowing population growth and, in turn, saving the planet from its greatest threat--climate change. The world is depending on you, Francis."
