It's a challenging question to answer because each child and family is different. These days children seem to get their first phones at earlier and earlier ages. In general, it seems that most parents ""give in"" during the transition to middle school. This is the age when peer groups become more important and when children start to seek independence from their families. And in the 21st century, a phone is an important marker of a child's independence from his or her parents. Or is it?We gave my 11-year-old son his first phone this Christmas, a full five months before his fifth grade graduation. Why? While on a business trip for several days, I wanted to speak to my son many times. Since we no longer have a babysitter, I had to rely on my 14-year-old daughter, my husband or the landline at home, and this was not a reliable system. So we bought him a phone. As a working mother, my son's phone gives me peace of mind. He can text us if he needs anything, or if he wants to go to a friend's house after school. More importantly, I can text him, when I am stuck in a meeting and will be late coming home, or when I am traveling and want to make sure he remembered to finish his project for school.But these are not the only benefits I receive from my son having a phone. If we get into an argument, it is sometimes easier to first apologize in writing. If I want to share a parenting lesson with him, I find he will more easily read a text rather than listen to me tell him the exact same thing face-to-face. It gives him time to absorb the substance of the words rather than tune out my voice (which he often hears as lecturing). So, I have to be honest, I love that my son now has a phone. Yes, sometimes he ignores me while playing Doodle Jump, but more often than not, we use it to communicate. And now that he is getting to the age when he wants to pull away from his mom and hang out more with his friends, his phone actually helps us stay close. If you are thinking about getting your child a phone, I recommend three things. 1. Fill out a contract together. Mine came from Common Sense Media; here is a link to a more personal one from a mom to her son. This is extremely helpful for many reasons, not only because it sets the rules for your child clearly, but also because it will help you think through the issues of phone ownership in a thoughtful and proactive manner.2. Do not allow your child to charge the phone in his or her bedroom. If possible, anyone with a device (yes, that means you) should charge it in a public place in your home.3. If you can afford it, get a case that protects the phone. We are going to try this $15 one -- it says it is the kind that you can drop from a helicopter.Also on HuffPost:"
1,MONEY,Time to Manage Your Charitable Portfolio?,"Susan Danish, Contributor
Executive Director, The Association of Junior Leagues Internat...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/time-to-manage-your-chari_us_5b9dc373e4b03a1dcc8c9b77,There is really very little to be gained by passivity in charitable giving. Make your investments in issues and in organizations that matter to you. You will be far less likely to fall for anything bogus.,2014-01-07,"'Have No Regrets' --Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin Group",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dbc28240000320053b4ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Whether you select your own stocks and bonds or invest in mutual funds and other vehicles, those with funds to invest put a good deal of effort into managing their portfolios, seeking the right balance of return and capital preservation or capital growth, whatever the objective at one's stage of life. Many of us are not particularly good at managing investments, however, so we seek professional help -- brokerage firms, financial advisors and the like. But when we give two percent of our household incomes (on average) to charitable causes and nonprofit organizations, we tend to be pretty darned passive about it. You're probably shocked at the two percent figure, particularly if you tithe or are otherwise unusually generous. However, the fact is that Americans contribute plus-or-minus two percent of their household incomes annually and have for many years in succession. The same plus-or-minus two percent applies to the percentage of Gross Domestic Product we contribute, and it's been at that level for many decades. Still, two percent of a very large number is also a very large number.The catch is, we are such a generous and activist people that we create new causes and nonprofit organizations all the time. The IRS is the only significant national regulator of charities and it has had little inclination or resources to ensure all are worthy of the designation, and so the numbers of nonprofits grew at pretty steep rates up until the last couple of years, when organizations that did not meet certain basic standards and reporting requirements were winnowed out. Good start, IRS.The upshot of dramatic growth in the number of nonprofits and the stagnancy in the rate of giving is more and more causes and organizations vying for a relatively fixed piece of the economic pie. But then you know that from all the mailings and phone calls and sidewalk intercepts and charity events, etc. that you experience almost every day. (Adding to the problem are all the small-p political and business interests masquerading as charities that raise money for their special interests, but that is a subject for another day.)It is literally impossible to cope with all the causes and organizations out there, so we tend to respond to who's in front of us, who asks us. They are probably good organizations and maybe we have done our research (I tend to think the BBB Wise Giving Alliance is the most methodical so-called-charity watchdog), but responding to requests is not a strategy. We're making investments. Why don't we bother to balance our giving portfolio to ensure that what we care most about, what is most important to us, is where we share our wealth?We can all take a page from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the Kresge Foundation and other well-run foundations. There is a standing joke among nonprofits (grant-seekers, in foundation lingo) that foundations (grant-makers, in foundation land) are always working on new strategic plans, especially when there are changes in foundation leadership: new CEO = new strategy. That said, major, professionally run foundations tend to examine their founders' intent, the nature of social issues relating to that intent, and a host of other factors to determine where they think investments of dollars for which they are responsible can make a difference. (I put ""they think"" in italics because there are not definitive societal priorities; there is always a significant element of subjectivity.) In other words, foundations set priorities and tend to do so in the context of a strategy, allowing the foundation to invest in several different thrusts and activities within each, just as we could as individual and family donors.I tend to think of a charitable portfolio having the following key elements:1) Stage of life, family-related giving. Supporting one's kids' sports leagues, community centers, etc. and later in life the programs that assist our grandparents or parents or relatives with disabilities throughout the lifespan is often at the core of our charitable activities and changes with our responsibilities at different stages of life.2) Issues that touch us in personal ways. Whether it is cancer or heart disease or learning for learning-disabled kids, these are the issues that affect people we care about, so we give these issues a greater urgency than other charitable choices.3) Issues that ignite our passions. Maybe you care a lot about access to family planning or reducing poverty or music or the visual arts. These are issues that relate to our values as citizens of the whole, but may or may not affect us quite as personally (except in aesthetic ways relative to the arts). Yet, they have their place in the queue of giving.4) Religion, religious community. Many of us want to support our chosen faith institutions and we may also want to support faith-related programs or causes that primarily benefit a given faith community, so perhaps we support the institution itself as well as individual religion-affiliated entities or umbrellas, like Catholic Charities or Jewish Federation.5) Ethnic identity giving. Some of us are quite melting-potted but many of us remember and honor our roots or perhaps identify with those roots and want to do something about the continuing challenges and well-being of our national or ethnic peoples.6) Community giving. United Way has morphed from an umbrella campaign to an entity that takes on big issues of community concern with community strategies. There are other kinds of organizations in this total-community space, most of them home-grown and often issue-oriented. Given that United Way raises over four billion dollars annually, it appears that ""community"" matters to many donors and should be budgeted for. This will drive you crazy but there is another level of priority-setting and portfolio-building --big buckets, like education, the arts (and within the arts, visual arts, music, etc.), health, and however else you think of the big elements that comprise what we think ""community"" should include. One could approach this cut as a separate priority or portfolio or as an element of ""Issues that ignite our passions.""With the exception of the so-called charities and solicitors that actually generate very little for the cause, so many of the organizations we are asked to contribute to appear very worthy of a gift, but I suggest resisting... unless that cause or organization holds a place in your charitable portfolio. There is really very little to be gained by passivity in charitable giving. Make your investments in issues and in organizations that matter to you. You will be far less likely to fall for anything bogus, far more likely to have a discernible impact, and infinitely more fulfilled and at peace with your investment in community."

But not everyone was pleased.Media outlets were quick to point out that Mindy's cover, though stunning, was a close up, black-and-white shot -- a stark difference from the full-length color photos chosen for the three other ladies who earned covers for the Women in TV issue. ""Kaling has said publicly that she's a size 8, and while that's an average size for normal women, it's not exactly the Hollywood status quo. It would have been a powerful move for Elle to show a full-length shot,"" Styleite wrote.Fashionista also noted: ""Kaling, the only woman of color to get her own cover, is also the only cover image rendered in black and white."" (Elle has come under fire before for allegedly lightening a cover star's skin as well as cropping out curvier stars' bodies.)So what does Mindy herself make of all of the hullaballoo? It seems she thinks it's pretty funny:That tweet seems to be the star's first mention of the so-called ""controversy,"" and she manages to make light of the whole thing (and plug her show at the same time -- two birds, one stone).

You've got a pooch. Your jeans are tight. You have discernible muffin top. Here's a tip: Don't hide out in sweats. Here are five tried and true styling tricks to slyly mask your post-holiday gut.Tip #1 CAMOUFLAGE CLOTHING: Walk to your closet and think about non-binding pieces that will comfortably drape over your bulging belly. Look for loose pieces like tunic tops, button downs, wrap dresses and empire waist topsTIP #2  STRETCHY BOTTOMS: Leggings are the most forgiving bottom. Soft, expansive and slimming, a black legging will impart a lean silhouette when paired with a top with volume. Another option is a jean with four-way stretch or compression.TIP #3  TEST DRIVE SHAPEWEAR: By reconfiguring the old school girdle, these microfiber bulge busters compress excess body flab to deliver a sleeker you. Wearing compression underwear or a tank top under your clothing can whittle a thick waist, trim thighs, mash muffin top and smooth miscellaneous lumps and bumps.TIP #4  COMPRESSION CLOTHING: Ready -to -wear clothing (meaning non-innerwear) like dresses, skirts, jeans and leggings have tapped into shapewear technology. The result is garments that can tame a protruding stomach, shape thighs and shave 10 pounds from a silhouette.TIP #5  STRATEGICALLY PLACED ACCESSORIES: After getting dressed, take five minutes to ""lean out"" your silhouette with accessories. A dangly eye catching scarf will slyly cover your bloated belly. And create verticality which will make you look longer and leaner. Long earrings will elongate your neck and visually draw attention (away from your butt) to your face. An easy-to-wear ankle bootie will lengthen your leg and-literally-lift you out of the frump and dumps.Voila! A sleeker, slimmer you.  P.S.

5,WELLNESS,10 Ways We Can Shape Up Together in the New Year,"Rana Florida, Contributor
CEO, The Creative Class Group & Best-Selling Author, Upgrade",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-and-fitness_us_5b9dbc52e4b03a1dcc8c3829,"In this New Year, we need to change our diets and the ways we think about and consume food. But to get there, it has to be a community effort.

More than one third of U.S. adults -- 35.7 percent of us -- qualify as obese according to National Institute of Health guidelines and the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents, especially among minorities, has almost tripled since 1980. The obesity epidemic has given rise to another epidemic, Type 2 diabetes, which is a man made disease. No hunter-gatherer ever suffered from this disease and it was extremely rare in our great-grandparents' time. But today, thanks to the excessive amount of sugar that we consume and our lack of exercise, it's become extraordinarily common. ""We evolved to crave sugar because sugar is an energy-rich food,"" Harvard professor of evolutionary biology Daniel Lieberman explained in an NPR interview with Terry Gross, ""but we didn't evolve to digest large amounts of it rapidly.""In this New Year, we need to change our diets and the ways we think about and consume food. But to get there, it has to be a community effort. Here are 10 ways we can all work together to create a fitter, healthier society.  Photo Credit: Huffington Post: ""Students in Sara Wright's fifth-grade class are embracing a new seating arrangement -- without chairs. The Wea Ridge Elementary School teacher in Lafayette, Ind., has swapped desk chairs for exercise balls, a move inspired by research on ramping up classroom motivation, WISH-TV reports.""1. School. Even though children are bursting with energy, we train them from an early age to sit still for eight hours a day, with just a measly 45 minutes to eat and run around. Kids need regular breaks for to get up, move around, exercise, jump and be active -- and not just gym class.2. The office. The places where many of us spend 40 to 70 hours a week, sitting at our desks, sitting in meetings, sitting in our boss's office, are chambers of fat. As I wrote in my book Upgrade, ""there's no reason to neglect our health or put aside our need for a healthy physical space just because we are at work."" Extended sitting slows the body's metabolism of glucose and lowers levels of HDL cholesterol. We can use standing desks or sit on exercise balls instead -- we all need to change our mindset and get up off our behinds.3. Grocery stores. Neighborhood stores and national chains need to think about the health of their customers and carry more fresh produce and other healthy choices. Processed foods that are high in trans fats and sugar should be banished to the back shelves or banned completely.4. Celebrity chefs. So many of the foods they prepare are filled with fat and sugar. They are tastemakers and influencers, and they can use their platforms to focus on healthier fare and portion control, and to show us that bigger and richer is not always better. 5. City and suburban planners. Their obsession with the car has killed walkability. Too many of us live in isolated McMansions in neighborhoods that have no urban fabric. Most Americans spend far too many hours of their days stuck in traffic. Every city needs sidewalks, bike lanes, bike sharing programs and parks. And playgrounds should keep their lights on longer, so kids can go out and play more.6. Exercise. The recommended daily minimum of exercise is 20 to 30 minutes, three to five days a week. It should be vigorous enough to raise your heart rate between 60 and 85 percent. That is not a big commitment.  7. Employee fitness programs. In their book The Power of Full Engagement, Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz report on one corporate fitness program that yielded ""a reported 47.5 percent reduction in absenteeism over a six-year period for participants... They also found that such employees used 14 percent fewer disability days than nonpariticapnts -- a total of nearly 12,000 fewer disability days overall. A study in the journal Ergonomics concluded that 'mental performance was significantly better in the physically fit than in the un-fit.'""8. City fitness programs. Mayors can use their bully pulpits to raise consciousness about fitness and goals, sharing details about their own efforts to diet and shape up. City facilities should be made available for exercise.9. Parents. At the very least, they can put a stop to their children's junk food binging, restrict technology and force their children to hit the backyard or park for active play. 10. Healthy food choices. The average adult male needs to take in about 2,200 calories a day to maintain their weight and 2,000 to lose weight; for most females the requirement is approximately 1,800 and 1,200 respectively. Countless apps are available to help you keep track of your daily caloric intake. Restaurants and fast food chains should be forced to report caloric information on all menus so customers can choose wisely."
