The vast destruction wreaked by the storm surge in New York could have been prevented with a sea barrier of the type that protects major cities in Europe, some scientists and engineers say. The multibillion-dollar price tag of such a project has been a hindrance, but may appear more palatable after the damage from Superstorm Sandy has been tallied.

I was away on 9/11, and again now during Superstorm Sandy. Some may consider being out of New York during those events a blessing, but it is my home and the only place I want to be when my family, friends, neighbors and loved ones need me.It breaks my heart to be away from home, powerless and unable to get back (whether it be due to weather or lack of available flights) to the people and the city that I love so much. Watching these horrific tragedies on television from across an ocean is almost unbearable. I have been fortunate enough to have gotten through, at long last, to family and friends; but it is not the same as seeing them with your own eyes and knowing firsthand that the people you hold dear are safe and sound.One of the things I love most about New York is the way we all pull together in hard times. We are known for it! New Yorkers are tough! We have to be... But the great part about that is that we are tough when we need to be as well. And, right now, we need to be!The amazing thing that I have noticed about these two horrific events is the way they seem to have brought so many people together. The one -- and, perhaps, only -- advantage to being so far away in a crisis is that you get to see the beauty in others, too. Everyone here knows I am from New York, and they stop me constantly to check on me and ask how I am, how my family is, and the state of things at home. These are total strangers in a foreign country that do not know me at all but, as soon as they realize I am American, they offer words of support and encouragement. The same was true when I was away after 9/11 and unable to return home for several days. There was such an outpouring of kindness and emotion from strangers that it almost made me feel like I was home. Don't get me wrong, I still wanted to click the heels of my ruby slippers three times because there really is no place like home, but for now, I will have to rely on the kindness of strangers. It is an incredible thing to feel that unconditional love and support from people all around the world. It reminds us of our common bond -- our basic humanity. Despite whatever chaos exists in the world, when you get right down to it, we are all human and we all understand what it is to suffer and how important it is to support one another in times of need.For more by SidneyAnne Stone, click here.For more on emotional health, click here."

Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall along the New Jersey shore, left parts of the state and the surrounding area without power including much of lower Manhattan south of 34th Street. AFP PHOTO/Brendan SMIALOWSKI (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c78c81f00005100213b57.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The embryos are safe. So are the frozen eggs and sperm at the NYU Fertility Center. But saving them required dramatic effort on the part of hospital workers, as Hurricane Sandy took down power and the backup generator failed. “There were heroes here,” Dr. Jamie Grifo, the fertility center's program director said in an interview today, describing the scramble Monday night and Tuesday. The building that houses the Fertility Center is located at 38th Street and First Avenue, which is outside the flood zone. But by Monday evening the power had failed, the basement had filled with water, and the fire department warned they needed to shut down the generator because they feared it was a fire hazard. The staff at the center offered to pump out the water in order to keep the generator functioning, and did so through the night. Anything frozen, Grifo explained, was never in danger. When sperm, eggs and embryos are stored for later use, they are frozen in liquid nitrogen, which does not depend on a power source. The real risk was to the live incubated embryos, which are created from eggs retrieved from ovaries, mixed with sperm, grown to a specific number of cells, and returned to the uterus, in a complex and carefully timed process. At 6 AM Tuesday morning Grifo picked up several staff members and drove to the office. They were there prepping for the day when the lights went out, and they quickly diagnosed that the generator, which was on the roof, had run out of fuel. The pump providing that fuel, which was in the basement, had blown a fuse. The alarm system for that pump did not fail, but the alerts it sent, by phone and internet, went unheard because the NYU system was down. So the staff switched to the third level of backup, battery packs in the lab designed to keep the incubators working in the event of a generator failure. There were only six hours of power in those batteries, and if the generator could not be restarted by then -- a complicated process that involved refilling the reservoir, changing the fuel filters and jump starting the engine -- the embryos would lose their life support. Meanwhile a patient had arrived for a scheduled egg retrieval. A phone call was made to Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York, which is the IVF program at Mount Sinai, and Dr. Alan Copperman agreed to take that patient immediately. Dr. Grifo got his car and drove the patient, her husband and their baby -- who had been conceived via Grifo’s lab -- 60 blocks north to Mount Sinai. Meanwhile, racing the clock, his staff began freezing the incubated embryos in liquid nitrogen. The half dozen patients who had planned to have those embryos transferred this week will have to wait a month, Grifo said, which certainly adds emotional stress to a process that can be draining -- but no embryos were lost. At the same time, the fertility center's staff carried ten 5-gallon containers of Number 3 generator fuel up eight flights of stairs to the roof, hoping to restart the system. The generator was restarted and has functioned continuously ever since. Once full power returns to the building, the incubators are waiting. Until then patients are being seen at a variety of offices around the city, particularly the New Hope Fertility Center in Columbus Circle, which has lent Grifo space, and where he did 11 egg retrievals yesterday, two today and has one scheduled tomorrow. He received offers of help from around the country, he said, a testament to the fact that “the people in this field understand that there is a paitent at the end of this. Everybody is working together not to compromise patient cycles.” He looks forward to welcoming the babies that he hopes will be born as a result of their work during these chaotic days. Perhaps one of them will be named Sandy. "

3,DIVORCE,Why My Son Has Faith In Marriage,"Terry Gaspard, Contributor
Licensed Clinical Social Worker, College Instructor, Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-my-son-has-faith-in-m_us_5b9c733ee4b03a1dcc7ebd24,"Even though children of divorce learn the hard way that marriage isn't a sure thing, they might also learn to take their time to pick a partner and acquire a healthy respect for commitment.",2012-10-31,Young man proposing marriage to surprised woman on the beach at sunset,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c733e240000500094ae0a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I wasn't expecting a phone call from Sean, my 28-year-old son, on a Saturday night three weeks before Christmas. We chat on the phone plenty but just not on Saturday nights. Coincidentally, I was celebrating the launch of my website with a small group of female friends when he caught me off guard saying, ""I proposed to her on a street car in New Orleans and she said yes."" Lucia and Sean had been dating for about two years, and Sean had recently shared with me that he felt sure he had met his match. This was the beginning of a year filled with joy and anticipation.  To say my son is romantic and sentimental is putting it mildly. Every birthday since he reached adulthood, I've been the lucky recipient of a bouquet of my favorite flowers in a real vase. But what I realized recently is we've spent a lot of time chatting about love. While I was launching a website and writing a book about restoring faith in love post-divorce, my insightful firstborn was soaking it all in -- even reading some of my blogs and posting them on his Facebook page. Just a couple of weeks ago, I was blessed to witness my son and his new bride exchange vows at a scenic overlook by the Hudson River. Sean and Lucia were both raised in divorced homes. As they stood in front of their family and friends and read their personally written vows, promising to love and cherish one another forever, I was overcome with emotion. I felt so proud that I had a raised a man who was so willing to put his heart on the line and pledge to love this woman forever.What was most striking about the ceremony is that despite being raised in fractured homes, Sean and his new wife radiated hope and confidence. As I greeted family and friends at the cocktail hour, it occurred to me that nearly every person in attendance at the wedding had been affected by divorce somehow. They had either been divorced themselves, grown up in a divorced home, or been impacted by divorce in some other personal way. And yet they were all here, imparting words of wisdom, toasting the bride and groom, and projecting optimism for the new life these two were just about to start.My son is an incredibly confident person. He has been since birth. He's always had a lot of friends, done well academically, and most importantly, he's been comfortable taking risks with his life. Moving across the country for his career and proposing to Lucia are prime examples. He's also had the advantage of having two parents who strived to keep his best interests at heart. Although he lived between his dad's house and mine, it did not deter him from feeling loved unconditionally.Sean's been fortunate enough to have kept most of his friends since elementary school. I've been lucky enough to see them grow up and watch the kind of adults they've become. One of his friends, who also grew up in a divorced home, cornered me outside of the ladies' room during the reception, looking for advice about moving in with her boyfriend. All around me were young people taking a chance on love, determined to keep a positive outlook on the future.Even though children of divorce learn the hard way that marriage isn't a sure thing, they might also learn to take their time to pick a partner and acquire a healthy respect for commitment. Rather than taking on a pessimistic view of marriage, they might embrace the silver lining inherent in experiencing their parents' breakup. They use it as an opportunity to make good decisions in picking a romantic partner and are better prepared to make a permanent commitment.I've asked myself why my son has faith in marriage, and there's no easy answer to this question. The truth about any relationship is that there are no guarantees, but you make a choice day in and day out to see things through. Growing up in a divorced home, I know that my son witnessed the breakup of my marriage, but he is sure enough in himself to believe that my fate does not need to be his fate. He has made a choice to live a life of intention and purpose, and has decided that he doesn't need to be defined by his past."

But here it is, Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2012, and I feel mostly good.",2012-10-31,"'I Promised Myself When I Made It Through, I'd Take My Girls to Disney World'",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c617326000036007f74af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"I was diagnosed on Jan. 18, 2011 with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. I was 43, a wife, a mother of four, and a midwifery student. I was breastfeeding my fourth child, our first son after three girls, an ""oops"" baby; he was just four months old when I noticed a weird lump in my right breast, up by the armpit. I was a natural-earth-mama type, hardly ever going to doctors, preferring herbal or homeopathic remedies, and my first thought was that I had a swollen lymph gland and that it would probably clear up by itself. It really did not even cross my mind that it could be cancer, and in fact I considered myself ""immune"" to it (no family history, no risk factors, 11 years of breastfeeding -- and counting -- to protect me). After a month, I did see a doctor, still thinking it was an infection either of my lymph gland or milk duct. She didn't think so, though, and sent me for an ultrasound. Both the doctor that read the ultrasound and the breast surgeon I saw afterward felt very sure that I had a fibroadenoma, or possibly a galactocele... both benign conditions. The surgeon recommend a repeat ultrasound in a month, to see if there were any changes, and a possible future but not urgent biopsy.I put off the ultrasound, though... it was the Christmas season, and I didn't feel like dealing with it. Then, Elizabeth Edwards died. Her story was a bit like mine: a late pregnancy, a lump that was noticed while breastfeeding. My mother urged me to go ahead and get a biopsy. Something told me she was right, so I scheduled it for Jan. 12.Nothing could prepare me for the reality of getting that phone call a week later from my surgeon, five months after first feeling the lump, telling me that I had breast cancer. It was so overwhelming, I fell apart; my mother had to take my kids that day, because I didn't want them to see me in that state. The absolute worst thing about the diagnosis, in those first days, was being told I had to wean my baby. It may be hard for some people to understand, but I could not see how I would be able to do that. I had never used bottles with my other babies and nursed them into toddlerhood; I considered extended breastfeeding to be the core of my mothering philosophy, the only way I could feed and comfort and care for my son. Having that ripped away from our relationship was completely devastating. I should have spent the month gradually weaning him, so that it would be done by the time I started chemotherapy, but I just couldn't do it... so there I was, nursing him for the last time on the morning of my first chemo. The second worst thing about the diagnosis was having to tell my mother (she had just gone through this the year before when her sister was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer), my oldest daughter (a junior in college), and my two elementary school-aged daughters. I feel terrible that not only have they had to see me go through this, causing them much fear and stress, but they also are now at higher risk for getting breast cancer themselves. This haunts me every day.I had eight rounds of chemo; after the fourth one, I had to be hospitalized for four days due to a neutropenic infection (my white blood cell count went down to zero), but other than that I got through it as well as can be expected. The chemo did its job and shrunk the tumors quite a bit (it turns out I had a second, smaller tumor as well). In July 2012, I had a bilateral mastectomy with immediate tissue expander placement. I chose to do the double because I knew that I would be constantly worrying about the other breast... and I'm glad I did, because the pathology report showed some precancerous cell changes in there. This is when I found out that I was Stage IIIA, due to the size of the lump and the fact that cancer was found in a few of my lymph nodes. The recovery was smooth but challenging (surgical drains to empty -- yuck -- and no hugging the kids for a few weeks); the expanders were extremely uncomfortable. A month after the surgery, I started radiation treatments: one per day (weekdays only) for 33 days. This was the easiest part of breast cancer treatment for me. I didn't mind going there every day, although my skin got pretty bad toward the end, quite burned and raw. I then had two months off to recover before my reconstruction surgery. On Dec. 14, I had a DIEP flap breast reconstruction. That's when they take the flab from your tummy and use it to reconstruct the breasts. This was the part I was ""looking forward"" to, because I had quite a mummy tummy after four kids, not to mention being quite anxious to get the expanders taken out. It was a long surgery, a long recovery, and I have some pretty crazy scars to show for it. But my plastic surgeon was amazing, and the results are better than I could have imagined. The year 2011 was, in short, the worst year of my life... a year that changed just about every part of my life. But here it is, Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2012, and I feel mostly good. I'm NED (no evidence of disease), and while I still frequently feel emotionally overwhelmed and terrified, other times I feel like a strong-survivor-warrior-goddess-woman who can do anything (at least during the short time periods in between the near-constant Tamoxifen-induced hot flashes).

Ameridose was accused by a business customer this year of failing to separate sterile and non-sterile products in its warehouse, charges it vehemently denied.

""This is a company that produces and ships a lot of sterile injectables. We are trying to mitigate the effects (of the Ameridose recall) on drug supplies."" FILLING THE GAPThe FDA has already spoken with other manufacturers about filling the supply gap left by the shutdown of Ameridose and now the recall of its products, Woodcock said, including helping those whose manufacturing facilities have been curtailed by technical or other issues ""get back into production.""Ameridose has been a major manufacturer of sodium bicarbonate injections, for instance, which are used in emergency care to normalize the acidity of a patient's blood. It also produced succinylcholine, a neuromuscular paralyzing agent used by anesthesiologists during surgery. Hospitals could face shortages of both drugs, Woodcock said.Those in Massachusetts, which have been major Ameridose customers, warned that the recall ""will exacerbate an already troubling shortage of medications that has arisen due to the permanent closure"" of the compounding pharmacy blamed for the meningitis outbreak and the temporary closing of Ameridose, the Massachusetts Hospital Association said in a statement.It added that drug ""shortages are prevalent,"" especially of generic sterile injectables including cancer drugs and anesthetics. In a study by the American Hospital Association, 82 percent of hospitals said patients had experienced delays in treatment due to drug shortages; more than half said the shortages prevented them from providing patients with recommended treatment.Ameridose is owned by the same people as New England Compounding Center (NECC), the compounding pharmacy whose injectable steroids turned out to be contaminated with fungus and are blamed for 368 cases of fungal meningitis. FDA inspectors have been combing through Ameridose's facilities since the company was closed.Separately, NECC hired Harris Beach PLLC, a law firm with offices in New York City and Newark, New Jersey, to lead its defense against civil claims, according to a filing on Wednesday with the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.NECC's defense will be led by high-profile corporate defense attorney Frederick Fern, a specialist in medical tort litigation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. According to the law firm's website, Fern has represented many pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including in a large case involving the diet-drug combination called fen-phen, and is also a registered pharmacist."

Leslie Booker began her career in the fashion industry and would have never guessed she'd one day exchange the runway for a juvenile detention center in the Bronx. But then again, Leslie certainly wouldn't be the first to see her life transformed by the practice of yoga.Leslie teaches yoga and meditation practices to youth in detention facilities in New York City through Lineage Project. Lineage places yoga instructors in prisons, public schools and other community sites where young people can most benefit from the calming and therapeutic techniques of the practice. In their own words, Lineage's mission is to ""use mindfulness practices to break the cycle of poverty, violence and incarceration in New York City."" Their students range from ages 10 to 24 and come from some of the economically poorest neighborhoods in New York City. Many are at risk of incarceration, and many, like those at Horizon, are already behind bars. The young adults at Horizon Juvenile Detention Center have been convicted for a range of offenses, some quite serious and violent. As Leslie points out, though, they are 14, 15, 16 years old -- little more than children -- and many of them have grown up in extremely trying circumstances. Before Leslie introduced the teens to the practice of meditation, aggression and withdrawal seemed to be among their only options for managing the insurmountable stress of life both at home and in the detention facility. After all, if no one ever taught you to take a deep breath and practice some self-love, you'd be hard-pressed to come up with the techniques on your own.The identities of the teenagers included in the video are concealed for their protection. But their voices and sentiments paint a remarkable portrait of the work Leslie and her students are doing through the practice of yoga. Yoga alone can't erase the past, but it can forever impact the future. And Leslie hopes that, equipped with mindfulness techniques, these young adults can return to their homes and communities with the vision of a very different life than they might have imagined for themselves.For more on Lineage Project, click here.Subscribe to The Chopra Well and don't miss next week's inspiring episode of URBAN YOGIS.

The call to put more heart than greed and more courage than fear into the ether. The call to try to overcome the very mistakes that make us human. We are in training. We keep getting thrown back in to more and more advanced tests to our humanity. We won't fail. We'll rise up, and rebuild. We are evolving. Aren't we?

9,WELLNESS,Do You Share the Compulsion to Take Notes?,"Gretchen Rubin, Contributor
Writer, The Happiness Project",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/take-notes_us_5b9c7767e4b03a1dcc7ee968,"For notes related to books I'm writing, I've wondered whether I should organize my notes better, but I do find that the action or scrolling through them and seeing odd juxtapositions of ideas helps to stimulate my own ideas and creativity.",2012-10-31,Cropped image of woman's hand with pen writing down notes,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c776726000035007f7d2a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of my ""Secrets of Adulthood"" is: People are more alike than we think, and we're less alike than we think.For instance: For years, I thought that my habit of constant note-taking was quite peculiar. But since I've written about my love of note-taking I've discovered that many people share this passion.In her essay ""On Keeping a Notebook,"" in Slouching Toward Bethlehem, Joan Didion describes this drive:The impulse to write things down is a peculiarly compulsive one, inexplicable to those who do not share it, useful only accidentally, only secondarily, in the way that any compulsion tries to justify itself.She's right to use the word ""compulsion."" I don't have to push myself to take notes; I have to stop myself from taking too many notes.I use a very loose method of organization. For my major topics, such as ""happiness"" or ""Churchill,"" I keep a single, giant, dedicated document. I add all relevant notes there, along with subject tags so that I can find the note later. I also have a document called ""Notes"" where I keep notes that don't belong in any particular place.For quotes, I have one document for general quotes; the other for happiness-related quotes, which I use for the Moment of Happiness, my daily emails of happiness quotes. (If you want to get a daily happiness quote by email, sign up here.) I love having a chance to make use of the quotes I love; I wish I knew how to make use of my giant trove of non-happiness-related quotes.For notes related to books I'm writing, I've wondered whether I should organize my notes better, but I do find that the action or scrolling through them and seeing odd juxtapositions of ideas helps to stimulate my own ideas and creativity. I worry that if I kept the notes in a highly-structured way, I might lose some of these benefits.How about you? Do you share this compulsion to take notes? How do you organize them?For more by Gretchen Rubin, click here.For more on happiness, click here.Would you like to get a signed, personalized, free bookplate for a copy of Happier at Home or The Happiness Project, to make a gift more personal?

Todd Akin, R-Mo., speaks during a news conference at the start of a statewide bus tour in St. Louis. Akin has backed millions of dollars of earmarks in recent years. He even proudly defended an earmark for military armor during a TV ad in his Republican Senate primary. Now Akin has aligned himself with a group that wants to ban earmarks. And the membership of the Senate Conservatives Fund has pledged $290,000 to help finance his campaign against Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. Akin denies he has flip-flopped and rejects any assertion of a quid pro quo for campaign cash.
