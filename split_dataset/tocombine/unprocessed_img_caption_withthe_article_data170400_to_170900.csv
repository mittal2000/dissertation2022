This one ends with great optimism about our ability to achieve an AIDS-free generation, and a reminder of what we still need to do to get there. This week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton introduced a Blueprint of actions for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and for our global partners -- with a clear focus on ensuring that no child is born with HIV, and that mothers with HIV remain alive and healthy.Standing with Secretary Clinton was our Foundation Ambassador Florence Ngobeni-Allen -- living proof of how far we've come toward this goal. While she lost her husband and daughter to AIDS in South Africa 16 years ago, today she is an AIDS advocate and mother of two healthy, HIV-negative children. Last week, UNAIDS reported that new HIV infections among children have fallen by 24 percent over the past two years alone -- and by as much 40 percent in six high-prevalence countries at the heart of the epidemic, including South Africa. But as many countries get closer to the goal of elimination of pediatric AIDS, in some ways our job gets harder as we focus our efforts in those countries still facing the most daunting obstacles. I'm spending this World AIDS Day in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where I'm reminded of some stark realities on the road to an AIDS-free generation.DRC is a huge country -- roughly the size of Western Europe -- and one of the world's most populated. But after a decade of conflict, it's also one of the poorest in terms of development, infrastructure, and access to healthcare. Life expectancy is just 48 years, maternal mortality is unacceptably high, and 20 percent of children die by the age of five.Across the country, women and families are also struggling to keep their babies HIV-free and healthy. Access to services to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV is in the single digits, one of the lowest in the world. Only 15 percent of people living with HIV who need antiretroviral treatment receive it, and very few of those are children or pregnant women.Still, after a week on the ground, I see reasons to be optimistic. DRC's government is confronting its AIDS epidemic, and has committed itself to the elimination of pediatric AIDS as a key goal. I visited the National Multisectoral AIDS Control Program in the capital of Kinshasa to meet leaders from across DRC, and discuss how we can better partner in our shared efforts to support families affected by HIV. I've been energized by the work I've seen from policymakers, colleagues, and partners - including a thriving network of local, private health care providers. Faith-based partners in particular are an integral part of health service delivery in DRC. The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation has been a partner to DRC since 2001, when we helped the government introduce PMTCT services to the country. Since then, we've tested nearly 700,000 pregnant women for HIV, and provided about the same number of women with services to keep their children HIV-free. This has also been the first year of the Foundation's new initiative in DRC, partnering with PEPFAR, the CDC, and the Ministry of Health to expand PMTCT and pediatric treatment. Over five years, our goal is to also improve HIV/AIDS services, strengthen DRC's health system, and promote local ownership and sustainable approaches. We call this initiative Project Malamu, from an expression in a local language that is a common response here to the greeting,""How are you?""It means that the person and his or her family are all doing well, and are in good health. We'll know that we're truly reaching an AIDS-free generation when ""Malamu"" is the response you hear from children, mothers, fathers, and families throughout DRC."

But for many children you probably do not know, December 1, World AIDS Day, may be the most important date on the calendar, signifying commitment and unity in the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the promise of many more birthdays and holidays to come. As physician-in-chief of Texas Children's Hospital and chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, I am firmly committed to American children, and cherish my role in helping to ensure that our children have access to health care second to none. It is through this service that my head -- and my heart -- have also led me beyond this country, to the other side of the globe, where I have met and treated some of the world's poorest and least fortunate children and families. Witnessing the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS on children and families across the globe has prompted me to act -- not just on December 1, but every day of the year. For nearly 17 years, I have led the development of the Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI), part of Texas Children's global health initiatives. What began as a small program in Romania today encompasses a network of state-of-the-art children's centers stretching across southern and East Africa, with more than 134,000 HIV-infected children in care. Across Africa, our centers provide comprehensive medical, psychosocial and prevention services to thousands of HIV-infected infants, children and adult family members, as well as ever-growing numbers of adolescents and young adults -- survivors of what had been a disease almost uniformly lethal by five years of age. Thanks to the widespread availability of HIV testing and antiretroviral medications in places like Botswana, transmission of the virus, including transmission from mother to baby, has been dramatically reduced. This huge public health success story is restoring hope to whole communities across Africa and around the world. And now, the lessons we have learned in scaling up the care, treatment and prevention of pediatric HIV/AIDS are being applied to a multitude of other medical conditions including malaria, tuberculosis, cancer and sickle cell disease, that have robbed children of their health and lives for generations. My work with BIPAI has made me, and many others, better physicians. I have learned how to diagnose disease using only my hands, eyes, and ears; how to deliver medical care under the most challenging conditions; how to improvise; and how to forge health care partnerships. I have learned how to talk to people who are not only afraid for their lives but also frightened of me, and the tools that I hold. And I have learned how to turn a handful of health professionals and a modest building with virtually no equipment and only a few medications into a thriving medical clinic that provides a lifeline to thousands of sick children.I have seen firsthand the lifesaving power of modest investments in health care, and I firmly believe that a better future for all citizens of the world will certainly mean a better future for our own children. So, on this World AIDS Day, I ask that each of you take a moment to reflect on how you can best help. Volunteering, advocating, and donating are just a few of the ways that individuals can impact the fight against HIV/AIDS. Certainly, on World AIDS Day 2012, we have much to celebrate, but also much work yet to do. The reward for our efforts will be nothing less than many thousands of birthdays and holidays that will be cause for celebration, not sadness. Please join me in the fight of my life, against pediatric AIDS."

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a 9 percent increase in net income for the third quarter, but revenue for the world's largest retailer fell below Wall Street forecasts as its low-income shoppers continue to grapple with an uncertain economy. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2deef240000510055b004.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, plans to begin denying health insurance to newly hired employees who work fewer than 30 hours a week, according to a copy of the company’s policy obtained by The Huffington Post.Under the policy, slated to take effect in January, Walmart also reserves the right to eliminate health care coverage for certain workers if their average workweek dips below 30 hours -- something that happens with regularity and at the direction of company managers.Walmart declined to disclose how many of its roughly 1.4 million U.S. workers are vulnerable to losing medical insurance under its new policy. In an emailed statement, company spokesman David Tovar said Walmart had “made a business decision” not to respond to questions from The Huffington Post and accused the publication of unfair coverage. Labor and health care experts portrayed Walmart’s decision to exclude workers from its medical plans as an attempt to limit costs while taking advantage of the national health care reform known as Obamacare. Among the key features of Obamacare is an expansion of Medicaid, the taxpayer-financed health insurance program for poor people. Many of the Walmart workers who might be dropped from the company’s health care plans earn so little that they would qualify for the expanded Medicaid program, these experts said.“Walmart is effectively shifting the costs of paying for its employees onto the federal government with this new plan, which is one of the problems with the way the law is structured,” said Ken Jacobs, chairman of the Labor Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. For Walmart, this latest policy represents a step back in time. Almost seven years ago, as Walmart confronted public criticism that its employees couldn't afford its benefits, the company announced with much fanfare that it would expand health coverage for part-time workers. But last year, the company eliminated coverage for some part-time workers -- those new hires working 24 hours a week or less. Now, Walmart is going further.Have you worked at Walmart? The Huffington Post wants to know about your experience. Send us an email here.“Walmart likely thought it didn’t need to offer this part-time coverage anymore with Obamacare,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “This is another example of a tremendous government subsidy to Walmart via its workers.”In pursuing lower health care costs, Walmart is following the same course as many other large employers. But given its unrivaled scale, Walmart’s policies tend to influence American working conditions more broadly. Tom Billet, a senior consultant at Towers Watson, a professional services firm that works with large companies to develop benefit plans, said other companies are also crafting policies that will exclude some part-time workers from medical coverage. Billet portrayed the growing corporate interest in separating out part-time workers as a reaction to another aspect of Obamacare -- the new rules that require companies with at least 50 full-time workers to offer health coverage to all employees who work 30 or more hours a week or pay penalties.Several employers in recent months, including Darden Restaurants, owner of Olive Garden and Red Lobster, and a New York-area Applebee’s franchise owner, said they are considering cutting employee hours to push more workers below the 30-hour threshold.“In the past, firms were less careful about monitoring whether someone was full- or part-time,” Billet said, noting that some of his clients were planning to track workers’ hours more carefully. “I expect health plans like Walmart’s won’t be uncommon as firms adjust to this law.” For Walmart employees, the new system raises the risk that they could lose their health coverage in large part because they have little control over their schedules. Walmart uses an advanced scheduling system to constantly alter workers’ shifts according to store traffic and sales figures. The company has said the scheduling system improves flexibility and efficiency. But in recent interviews with The Huffington Post, several workers described their oft-changing schedules as a source of fear that they might earn too little to pay their bills. Many said they have begged managers to assign them additional hours only to see their shifts cut further as new workers were hired.The new plan detailed in the 2013 ""Associate’s Benefits Book"" adds another element to that fear: the risk of losing health coverage. According to the plan, part-time workers hired in or after 2011 are now subject to an “Annual Benefits Eligibility Check” each August, during which managers will review the average number of hours per week that workers have logged over the past year. If part-time workers hired after Feb. 1, 2012, fail to reach the 30-hour threshold, they will lose benefits the following January, according to the book. Part-time workers hired after Jan. 15, 2011, but before Feb. 1, 2012, must work at least 24 hours a week to retain coverage and will also be subject to an eligibility check each year. Those hired before 2011 aren’t subject to the minimum hours requirements or eligibility checks.As for full-time workers under the plan, those who lose hours and slip to part-time at any point during the year will see their spouses’ health coverage dropped immediately. Those workers will also lose their dental and life insurance policies in the following pay period, according to the plan.Some Walmart workers who are excluded from the company’s health care plans are likely to become eligible for Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion, which aims to replace a patchwork of standards now set by individual states with one minimum federal threshold -- income below 133 percent of the federal poverty line, which for an individual currently comes to $14,856. However, the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that the decision to expand the program is voluntary for the states. At least eight states, including Texas, have said they will not expand the program, which would leave Walmart workers there with one less option.Part-time workers who lose their Walmart insurance but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid should be able to buy insurance through the health care exchanges to be established under Obamacare -- essentially, online marketplaces offering an array of health care plans. For workers who do qualify for health coverage under Walmart's new policy, the latest package represents an upgrade over previous plans. Walmart’s health plans began covering 100 percent of spine and heart surgeries this year at select hospitals and medical centers. They also include a smattering of preventative care services required by Obamacare. But the company’s plans still leave many workers facing significant financial distress in the event of major illness. Under the new policy, one major offering, the so-called Health Reimbursement Account Plan, costs nonsmoking workers $34.80 a month -- a seemingly affordable sum. Yet it comes with an annual deductible of $2,750, a hefty expense given that half of Walmart’s hourly workforce earns no more than $10 an hour. While a shifting of Walmart employees to Medicaid rolls may increase the burden on American taxpayers, it is likely to be a better deal for the workers themselves. “The packages Walmart is providing for low-income people aren’t offering very much coverage except for catastrophes,” said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning think tank. “It’s likely they’ll be better off going with a government-sponsored plan.”"

The storm has claimed at least 40 lives in the United States, and has caused massive flooding across much of the Atlantic seaboard. US President Barack Obama has declared the situation a 'major disaster' for large areas of the US East Coast including New York City. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb35d1a2400003000975666.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Could an Internet blackout -- like the one that began Thursday in Syria -- happen in the United States?Not likely, says Renesys, which on Friday published an infographic titled ""Could It Happen In Your Country?"" The global Internet intelligence company took a map of the globe and color-coded countries based on how difficult it would be to achieve an ""Internet blackout"" in that country. The U.S. falls in the category of least risk, according to that graphic.But why?Renesys points out that the U.S. is served by a huge number of Internet service providers, more than 40 in all. Like Canada and the Netherlands, it is a ""global Internet economy"" -- which means that even if the government wanted to black out the Internet, it likely could not. Says James Cowie on the Renesys blog:If you have more than 40 providers at your frontier, your country is likely to be extremely resistant to Internet disconnection. There are just too many paths into and out of the country, too many independent providers who would have to be coerced or damaged, to make a rapid countrywide shutdown plausible to execute. A government might significantly impair Internet connectivity by shutting down large providers, but there would still be a deep pool of persistent paths to the global Internet.Eva Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation says she largely agrees with the Renesys assessment, but in a phone interview with The Huffington Post, she spoke about the weak links in U.S. connectivity.“We do have a limited number of entry points for undersea cables coming into the U.S., so in some ways that is a weakness,"" she said.""If you want some insight into how vital the undersea cables are, you should take a look at the logs of the NANOG [North American Network Operators Group] mailing list, the people that essentially run the Internet’s backbone in North America, from around the time of 9/11,"" she added. ""They were actually in danger of losing an undersea cable that came into Manhattan, and thus losing a very large chunk of Internet, because so much of it was sitting under WTC 2.""But Galperin believes an undersea cable cutting isn’t something the nation's Internet users should worry about any time soon.“If you get to where the government is cutting cables in order to shut out Internet access to the U.S.,"" she said, ""you’ve abandoned the rule of law. All bets are off.”Moreover, simply snipping undersea cables in the U.S. would not cut it off from the world completely. Internet traffic from many parts of the country could still reach Canada and Mexico.And, should this heady combination of legal and infrastructural roadblocks not be enough to keep the U.S. government from considering a blackout, other obstacles still exist. Cutting the country off from the global Internet would be an economic and political catastrophe, both domestically and globally.“This is an extremely unlikely scenario.” Galperin said. “I’m astonished people still worry about this.”The fears aren't coming out of nowhere. Members of the U.S. Congress have at times raised the idea of giving the president the legal authority to create an Internet ""kill switch"" -- the power to order ISPs to disconnect certain websites, stop the flow of information from certain countries or even create an internet service blackout.Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other authoritarian leaders have used similar tactics to bring down the Internet during periods of civil unrest. Murbarak, for example, simply ordered Egypt's ISPs to stop providing domestic Internet ahead of large-scale protests during the Arab Spring in January 2011, and the country was largely cut off from the global Internet. It is believed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad may have ordered a similar crackdown on the free flow of data into and out of Syria as the conflict between pro-Assad forces and anti-government rebels worsens. (Internet returned to two Syrian cities on Saturday, according to reports.)But in the U.S., plans for an Internet ""kill switch"" have met with much resistance. After two bills failed to progress in 2009, Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.) in 2010 sponsored a bill known as the Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act. The bill would have given the Department of Homeland Security the power to command ISPs in the case of a ""cyberemergency,"" but the proposed legislation died later that year. It was was resurrected briefly in 2011 but failed again after Mubarak shut down Egypt's Internet. No ""kill switch"" bill has been proposed in the U.S. since 2011."

But the uproar has already begun, with a swarm of coverage that has transformed a conference championship into a playoff for the national title.Forget the reemergence of Notre Dame as one of the nation's elite programs, something that would normally dominate the college football landscape. For this week anyway, all eyes will be turned on the Georgia Dome, and rightly so -- the winner will be riding a streak of six consecutive national championships for the conference. The victor will probably be the favorite in the national title, despite the Fighting Irish's vaunted defense and unblemished 12-0 record.If Georgia is that team, it will be due to a number of factors: the coaching of Mark Richt, the play of the defense led by All-American Jarvis Jones and the efforts of two freshmen running backs who have fans screaming, ""Gurshall."" But amidst the myriad of storylines for Georgia's season, the play of Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray exceeds them all.The junior's story is well-known by now. His career has been marked by brilliant statistics, then discredited by inopportune losses. Murray has already shattered the school record books, and has now moved on to the conference marks. He leads the nation in passer efficiency and holds school records for single-season touchdowns (35) and overall touchdowns (89).But Murray has also been plagued by a 3-9 record against ranked opponents and the unshakeable notion that he can't win the proverbial ""big game."" Those first two victories over ranked opponents came against No. 24 Auburn and No. 25 Georgia Tech last season, and the third came in a 17-9 victory over No. 2 Florida earlier this year. But though Murray passed for the game-winning touchdown against the Gators, he also threw three interceptions and completed only 50 percent of his passes.Murray will be the second Georgia quarterback to play in back-to-back SEC titles, after David Greene accomplished the same feat from 2002-2003. If he can win one, he would join rare company for Georgia, which has won two SEC Championship games, in 2002 and 2005. If he wins the national title, his victories would finally match his statistics in declaring him the best quarterback in Georgia history.His work can easily be erased though -- a loss would cause a freefall for Georgia's ranking and its bowl hopes. Murray, even with an inspiring performance, would go down as the quarterback who couldn't win.Murray asked for permission to be excused from media interviews this week. There was nothing controversial about doing so, though it was surprising, since he had never refused weekly interviews in his three years as a starter. But the message was clear: no distractions. The given reason was that he wanted to have as much time to prepare against Alabama.With the amount of noise surrounding this game, it's no wonder. The weight of storylines yet to be written has to be crushing, when Murray's history could go from one extreme to the next. With one result, he would be dubbed a champion; with the other, a disappointment.And, in a sport which deifies the starting quarterback's ability to influence games, only the scoreboard will close the book on Murray's legacy.-----------Gurley crucial to Georgia's success against AlabamaTodd Gurley has been the revelation that the Bulldogs sorely needed at the tailback position this season.But if they are to go where they hope, Gurley will need to be a playmaker against No. 2 Alabama in the SEC Championship game Saturday.It's the natural progression for a running back that burst into the scene in No. 3 Georgia's first game of the season, rushing for two touchdowns and scoring a 100-yard kickoff return to boot. Reach the SEC Championship game? That was expected. But now the hard part -- winning -- will be dependent on whether Georgia's most prominent addition can make a difference.Gurley runs like a much smaller man, boasting top-level track speed despite being taller than most running backs. He has runs of 55, 51 and 49 yards on the season, bolstering his reputation as a break-away threat. But it will be his size -- all 6-foot-1, 218 pounds of it --which will prove crucial for No. 3 Georgia's chances of upturning Alabama as the top team in the conference.It's not that Gurley will need to break a big run. Alabama simply won't allow that, with the defense holding conference opponents to 2.4 rushing yards per carry, on average. In fact, the Crimson Tide hasn't allowed a rush longer than 32 yards all season.But Gurley, who leads conference running backs with 1,138 yards and 14 touchdowns, can make this game competitive for Georgia simply with his yards after contact. The Alabama defense, which often dominates the line of scrimmage, will hit Gurley early and often. But if he can manage to squeeze through a few yards after the hit, the line will soften.The Georgia offense will be placed in more favorable second and third down situations. The Bulldogs could maintain the semblance of balance required to get receivers open downfield and quarterback Aaron Murray, who leads the nation in passing efficiency, would receive the extra time required to complete those passes.This isn't news for the Georgia offense -- offensive coordinator Mike Bobo maintains a strict balance in order to strike this very chord. The blueprint to winning against Alabama has already been given to Georgia in the form of its earlier matchup against then-No. 2 Florida, a 17-9 victory that came partly as a result of the Bulldogs' suffocating defense.But the overlooked performance of Todd Gurley in that game could be the difference against the Crimson Tide. Gurley ran for 118 yards on 27 carries against the Gators, with most of the yards mirroring the grind-it-out variety, rather than the bigger gains he has been known for.His longest run was for 23 yards, but it was Gurley's ability to add extra yards that allowed Georgia to gain 14 first downs, despite only going 1-for-10 on third downs and having three turnovers.If Gurley can reproduce that type of performance, the Bulldogs may have a chance to win a conference championship. And the freshman running back so readily compared to Georgia legend Herschel Walker would be poised to bring the Bulldogs a championship of his own."

That all changed against LSU. The Tide escaped Death Valley with one of the most dramatic comeback victories in school history. Alabama got the win, but the Tigers exposed serious holes in the Tide's secondary. But the next week, hot shot quarterback Johnny Manziel and a young, hungry Texas A&M team took it to Alabama. The loss dropped the Tide to No. 4 in the BCS standings behind three undefeated teams, putting the Tide's dreams on hold. Flash forward to today, after two of the undefeated teams lost, Alabama is right back in the hunt for the national title. A win over No. 3 Georgia will give the Tide a chance to play for its third national championship in four years. Let me be the first to admit that this will be hard fought, tough game for Alabama, but I believe they'll pull away late and here's why.Georgia's big game struggles Georgia and quarterback Aaron Murray have struggled on the big stage and what bigger stage than the SEC Championship.In the 2011 SEC Championship, the Bulldogs played well for most of the first halftime before falling apart and getting destroyed by LSU.This season, in a highly anticipated matchup, Georgia was routed by South Carolina. It was hard to watch as the Gamecocks front seven manhandled Georgia's offensive line and put Murray on the ground.Even if you look at the Florida game this year, Murray struggled. Yes, the Bulldogs won, but Murray still threw three interceptions. Georgia tried to give the game away, but Florida just played a little worse and the Bulldogs escaped.On the other side, Alabama's AJ McCarron is a proven quarterback and has performed well on the biggest stage. If it comes down to quarterback play, McCarron has the edge.Coaching battleGeorgia head coach Mark Richt has consistently under achieved. He's had national championship caliber talent, but has yet to win the big one. There's no denying that Richt is a fantastic coach, but ultimately coaches are defined by what they do in big games and Richt has yet to get his team over the hump.Alabama's Nick Saban is a proven big game coach and has three BCS National Championships to prove it. What other coach could lose as much talent as Saban did last year and still have his team within a game of playing for back-to-back national championships?Poking the bearWe all want players and coaches to be honest when answering questions and that's exactly what Georgia safety Baccari Rambo was. During an interview on ESPN radio, Rambo was asked if he thought Georgia was more talented and he responded, ""I feel like we are more talented. We have better players at each position across the board, especially on defense. It's gonna be a great challenge. I know it's gonna be a great battle. It's gonna come down to who has the best defense. It's gonna come down to who makes more turnovers. It's gonna be a battle of the defenses.""Even if the part about Georgia being more talented is true, why say it? All this does is give Alabama, especially its defense, a little extra motivation. That statement puts more pressure on the Georgia players and Richt because if Georgia loses, people will point to coaching as the reason since they supposedly have better players. Also, Georgia hasn't done anything on the national stage in recent memory, so it would be wise for the Bulldogs to keep quiet. With all that said, I believe Georgia has more NFL level talent, but Alabama has the better team and should win this game and clinch its spot in the national championship and a date with No. 1 Notre Dame.

Rodriguez/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c90fc26000036007f8786.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rumors swirled this week about the suspected, but likely soon-to-be-officially-confirmed, second pregnancy of pop star Jessica Simpson. ABC News blogger Luchina Fisher encapsulates the skewed cultural mindset when it comes to women and body image when she writes: ""Jessica Simpson could be gaining back some of the 60-plus pounds she lost after giving birth to daughter Maxwell Drew in May."" Fisher skips a chirpier, pop media approach to the story that might offer tentative congratulations for Simpson and her fiancé, Eric Johnson, or make some other kind of cutesy remark about Simpson, who also has a clothing line, ""designing for two."" Instead, Fisher cuts right to the proverbial chase by zeroing in on Simpson's body. During her first pregnancy, Simpson's weight fluctuation became typical tabloid fodder. Her subsequent campaign to lose the weight by becoming a spokesperson for Weight Watchers garnered equal attention, a tacit nod that Fisher makes in leading her piece with a statement about Simpson's body rather than her alleged pregnancy. The preoccupation with women's pregnant bodies has reached new highs causing us to stoop, as Fisher illustrates, to new lows as we widen our cultural obsession with physical ideals to include pregnancy. Demi Moore was one of the first women to break the ""belly barrier"" when she posed naked and pregnant for the cover of Vanity Fair in 1991. Since that time, other celebrities (including Jessica Simpson) have followed suit, or rather birthday suit: Britney Spears, Christiana Aguilera and supermodels Miranda Kerr, Cindy Crawford and Claudia Schiffer. These images provoke responses that range from disgust over the public display of a private issue to praise for these women proudly exposing their pregnant bodies and helping to overturn notions that pregnancy somehow distorts women's bodies in a way socially viewed as negative. These daring representations also raise concerns about the emphasis placed on the bodies of these women rather than their overall health or well-being. In the light of the photo shoot, in the airbrushed pixels of the computer proofs, the pregnant body shifts from a functional, organic entity to a glammed-up, commodified extension of the woman's idealized self-image. For civilian women (i.e. the non-celeb sect), the pressure to capture every moment of your pregnancy is registered through an uptick in professional pregnancy photographs, pregnancy time-capture videos posted to YouTube and on social media sites such as Pinterest. The home photo front enables women to demonstrate a large amount of creativity in the way they showcase their bodies: Women with a 'Hello My Name Is' badge taped across her navel, women lying in fields or beneath trees with their rounded bellies exposed and pregnant women swimming or submerged in soapy baths. A subgenre of ""crazy"" and ""awkward"" pregnancy photos reveals women posing pregnant with firearms, with their bellies ornately painted as if they were sports super fans and even perched on horseback, mostly naked except for some strategically placed, flowing white material. The desirable pregnant body is more than the vehicle for a new life, it is the vehicle for the ideal woman: playful, graceful, dreamy, seemingly uninhibited by the way she lounges among the bugs and dirt in a wild, English garden, seemingly unencumbered by the extra 8 pounds forever pressing on her bladder. It is a highly contrived capture of a, presumably, joyful moment in the woman's life, yet the cultural weight these images accrue surpass their status as mere artifacts to become bench markers of an envisioned mommyhood that will never live up to the realities of new mothering. That women feel more comfortable expressing and documenting their experience of pregnancy is a good thing. Among friends my age, the photographic evidence of our pregnant mothers are few and far between, typically relegated to the requisite snap from a baby shower or candid shot at a neighborhood picnic. Then again, those photographs ended up in albums, not splashed across websites fired up around the world. And the purview of contemporary women reared on mobile media encourages a freeness about seeing and being seen that our mothers can only observe and shake their heads at. This does not account for the relentless preoccupation with women's bodies, especially ones that bear the mark of difference in some way, or excuse the disconcerting messages to women about the right and wrong way to be in their pregnant bodies. That is why the scrutiny on Jessica Simpson's barely pregnant body and its impact on her career as a Weight Watcher's spokeswoman is so disheartening. The media has already proscribed a pregnancy journey for Jessica Simpson where the presentation, display, marketability of her body and attendant assessments about that body takes precedence over the life growing inside."
