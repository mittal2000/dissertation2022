1,POLITICS,"RNC Announces New, Vastly Less Insane Primary Debate Schedule",Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rnc-debate-schedule_n_6489772.html,,2015-01-16,"MESA, AZ - FEBRUARY 22: Republican presidential candidates (L-R) U.S. Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich participate in a debate sponsored by CNN and the Republican Party of Arizona at the Mesa Arts Center February 22, 2012 in Mesa, Arizona. The debate is the last one scheduled before voters head to the polls in Arizona's primary on February 28 and Super Tuesday on March 6. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e69171c2600001123b62ec4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Republican National Committee, in its after-action report on the 2012 election (known by its nickname, the ""RNC Autopsy""), made it a goal to do something about the long-winded primary process that its leaders believe did their efforts more harm than good. The process of ""de-suckifying"" the presidential primaries has been long developing -- the broad strokes came to light back in December 2013, in a report from CNN's Peter Hamby -- but are now beginning to find form. The RNC has already decided to stage an earlier convention, and to run a disciplined primary calendar. On Friday came news of the third prong of these reforms: making the debate schedule less insane.There is, perhaps, no worthier goal. If you can bear to recall the last time there was a GOP presidential primary, the debate season was baffling and horrible to all living creatures. When I look back on the schedule from that cycle, I still feel the dread, deep in my bones, lurking like a Korean water ghost. Look at this nonsense! If you include all the various forums and stunt appearances, the number of debates (or debate-like pseudo-events) add up to 27 occasions in which candidates had to meet and spar with one another. There was a debate on May 5, 2011. May 5, 2011! CNN, which is bad at debates, staged seven. In one particularly idiotic period, there was an ABC News debate on the night of Saturday, Jan. 7, 2012, followed by an NBC News debate on the morning of Sunday, Jan. 8. What could possibly happen overnight to necessitate such a thing? ""Question to Rick Santorum, followed by a one-minute rebuttal from Jon Huntsman: What did you dream about last night? Did you sleep okay?""That was a clown debate schedule, bro. The good news is that the RNC has actually maybe found a way to de-clown it. Per Politico's James Hohmann and Alex Isenstadt:The Republican National Committee will announce Friday that it has sanctioned nine presidential primary debates, starting this August in Ohio and continuing through March 2016, with the potential to add a few more.What they've come up with makes a lot more sense. The schedule, as outlined, features nine debates, with the option to add three more if a competitive primary persists into the month of March. The earliest debate is August 2015, which is still too early, really, but at least it's not May. The RNC is going to limit the debates so they are more geographically diverse -- no state will host more than one debate. And CNN is only getting two debates (three if the race extends into March), thus reducing the role that Wolf Blitzer will play in all of this.What of the other networks? Fox News will get the first crack at the candidates in the aforementioned August debate. In the nine-debate scenario, Fox News (or Fox Business) will get two more debates. CNBC, CBS, ABC, and NBC News (in partnership with Telemundo) get one each. Should the primary season roll into March, Fox and CNN would host additional debates, with the 12th debate being advertised as a ""Conservative Media Debate.""Back in March 2014, the RNC was talking about imposing a greater amount of control over who gets to moderate the debates. According to Politico's Katie Glueck, RNC officals were mulling the demand to ""hand-pick"" the moderators. At the time, it wasn't clear what sort of role the big news networks would play in this process, as RNC chairman Reince Priebus seemed inclined to feature only ideological allies as debate moderators. As Hohmann and Isenstadt report, it's more clear that the RNC is pushing for a ""partnership"" between ""mainstream media organizations"" and ""more conservative commentators and outlets."" What's to stop a candidate, thirsty for additional attention, from breaking with the RNC's plan and attending an unsanctioned debate? Here's where the RNC wields the stick. According to Hohmann and Isenstadt, ""any candidate who participates in a non-sanctioned debate will not be allowed to participate in any more sanctioned debates."" What are the ramifications here? Well, there will be fewer opportunities for candidates on the fringes of polling, or who are short of money, to use these free media appearances to generate momentum. That likely means that this cycle won't become the wild tilt-a-whirl of flash-in-the-pan frontrunners for which the last GOP primary cycle is best known. However, it probably limits the ability of a candidate to do what Rick Santorum did -- slowly punch his way to relevance over the course of a long and varied debate season. From the standpoint of the media, this process may be one step on a slippery slope. Good people can debate (though, please, not 20 times) whether seeking to have your candidates confronted by moderators that are more ideologically inclined in their direction smacks of smarts or cowardice. Speaking only for myself, I don't see any reason why conservative moderators in a GOP primary debate wouldn't ask substantive, hard-hitting questions, but I'm prepared to find out that I'm wrong. As far as this issue goes, the Democrats can't claim purity -- back in 2007, the Democratic candidates, by dribs and drabs, backed out of a debate on Fox News.What's more concerning is the fact that this debate schedule's been set with memories of Priebus making broad threats about various outlets' editorial decisions still fresh in the memory. Back in 2013, Priebus -- angry about a Hillary Clinton miniseries in production at NBC, and a Hillary documentary by Charles Ferguson coming from CNN -- threatened to sanction the two networks. The punishment? Refusing to allow them to stage a sanctioned primary debate. (Worth noting again: It completely eludes me why Priebus thought that Charles Ferguson was going to do a Hillary hagiography, given his past work. Clinton's allies were, if anything, even more eager to get the documentary canceled than Priebus was.) Those two projects, having been scuttled, no longer loom over the landscape as matters of concern. Still, if past is prologue, it's not hard to see how being extended the opportunity to stage a debate might color a news organization's editorial decisions. How much criticism of the candidates can, say, CBS News induge in before Priebus tells the network it's no longer allowed to join in any reindeer games?Also at issue is the role of local news organizations and newspapers, whose involvement in the debate process is unclear at this time. It's very possible that future announcements will bring state-based media and publications into the fold as partners -- there's certainly a longstanding precedent for it. This is something Priebus should consider carefully: I consider it near-axiomatic that if you want a media that's disinclined to fixate on the Hot Gaffe Of The Week, look to the locals.So there's no guarantee that this process won't, in the end, prove to be problematic. Still, not having 20-some-odd debates is something that we can all get behind. And here's hoping that the RNC will hand down strong sanctions on anyone who confuses a lectern for a podium.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

Paul Bastean, owner of the range, told AFP that business had grown as a result of anxiety about reaction to the jury announcement in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Typical sales of five to seven guns a day have risen to 20 to 30 in the last week, while gun-handling courses for November and December are fast selling out. Violence erupted in the St Louis, Missouri suburb for a second night on November 25 over the decision by a grand jury not to prosecute a white police officer for shooting dead Brown, an unarmed black teenager.

Politics triggers pre-programmed emotions. It generates conversation and, let's face it, amps the theater of media and 140-character tweets. But when politics distracts us from focusing on concrete issues that can potentially save lives -- by preventing unsafe behaviors in the future -- it hurts us all. Why did the unfortunate mother carry her firearm off-body? We know that she was using a zippered pouch, but does anyone seriously believe that was a wise choice with a nimble and curious toddler? Safety isn't just about prescribed rules, it's also taking time to consider situational context...When these incidents happen, shock and blame seem to trump more pragmatic dialogue. Shouldn't we dig deep enough to find the remedy as well as the cause of the tragedy? Or as Sgt. Joe Friday of Dragnet said: Just the facts, ma'am. The ""anti-gun"" side trumpets the tragedy, but the gun owner's side disregard much of what they say because of their own political orientation. The gun side often behaves as if making too much of these incidents creates political risk and harm, and so takes a dissonant stance in response to an avoidable tragedy. Gun owners shy away from the political outrage of the ""gun control"" people. This is a big problem. Take politics and culture out of the issues of responsibility and safety that should inform intelligent conversation and messaging. The leaders of the gun community and control advocates can both own this. They both can exhibit the level of leadership common in other segments of society in order for progress to be made.However, if that leadership is not on the immediate horizon, gun owners are the ones that can actually take immediate concrete steps to reduce avoidable tragedies. They should not shy away from embracing a safety code that respects the rights of their neighbors and protects innocent lives. The airline industry, and even individual pilots, are fine describing a crash as ""pilot error,"" and more importantly, using the ""learning"" to avoid future disasters. We find no issue in placing responsibility for the majority of fatal auto crashes on the driver. It is usually not the machine, but the operator of the machine who is at fault. As they say in the military, there is no such thing as ""accidental discharge.""If we continue to make safety a political ""third rail"" -- or the province of Twitter and media -- we have less chance to gain the focus needed to create behavioral changes, and these incidents will continue to happen over and over again. No one in the gun industry we have spoken to says they are not committed to making safety paramount. Everyone acknowledges the many opportunities for human error (whether through lax safety choices or just being uniformed). Many want to do more to promote safety.But the lack of support for coming up with more innovative ways to promote smart safety campaigns is glaring. No one wants to read another article about an avoidable shooting. Taking this on is something that is aspirational and heroic. An industry that has been referred to as a ""cottage industry,"" but now generates national conversations every day, should at least consider other ways to promote non-political safety messages that talk to new and unschooled consumers of firearms. Along with reminding those who have grown up around guns. No one gets hurt with an extra reminder or two about safety. No one.Our organization has launched two national safety PSAs. The most recent, ""Playthings"" has been viewed by almost 7 million people -- the most viewed gun safety spot in history. The Blaze's Dana Loesch, was one of the first to say she liked the campaign and the use of humor to promote safety. Getting more people and industry folks behind campaigns like ours -- by trying new approaches -- will save lives and amplify a non-political message we can all agree on.

Today the Justice Department limited the circumstances in which  local and state police can use a federal program to seize a person's property without evidence of a crime. That might sound odd, since you would assume that it was already illegal in America for police to take your property without due process -- but you would be wrong. Originally pushed in the 1980s as a way to combat illegal drugs, civil asset forfeiture has become common throughout the country. Today people all over America who are simply suspected of drug law violations can have their assets seized without any ability to defend themselves in a court of law. Even if they are never convicted, or even charged with a crime they can have their property, bank accounts, cars, and assets taken from them forever.Civil asset forfeiture is another ugly aspect of the drug war, and we are making it a top issue in 2015. Today's actions by Eric Holder are a good first step to ending the unjust enforcement of this program once and for all.

That represents 86 percent employment growth since the organization began tracking job figures in 2010. By the end of 2015, companies said they expect to hire an additional 36,000 new solar workers.The solar industry installed 7,200 megawatts of new solar power last year, the foundation said. More than half of the solar industry jobs -– 55 percent -– involved installation, and 19 percent were in manufacturing. The report found those jobs pay an average of $20 to 24 an hour. ""We can very definitely say that these solar jobs are good, well-paying jobs, which I think is important,"" Andrea Luecke, executive director of the Solar Foundation, said in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""While the economy has improved since we started this census series in 2010, at the height of recession, there are still lots of people without college degrees looking for work. Solar provides that kind of work.""The report found that 21.6 percent of workers in the solar industry were women. Latino workers made up 16.3 percent of the workforce, while Asian and Pacific islanders represented 7 percent. African-Americans made up 6 percent of solar staffers. Luecke said the recent growth is largely due the surge in solar installations.""The reason that installations are growing like gangbusters is because of cost reductions,"" Luecke said, noting that the average price of solar panels has declined 64 percent since 2010.Luecke said the foundation expects the trends to continue for at least the next two years. ""We can expect the census for 2015 and '16 to show solid job growth,"" Luecke said. But for 2017, ""we're not that bullish,"" she said, largely due to the anticipated expiration of the investment tax credit -- a 30 percent tax credit for residential solar. It's unclear whether Congress will extend the credit. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz issued a statement praising the solar job figures, noting that one out of every 78 new jobs created in the U.S. last year was in solar energy. ""This diverse and vibrant workforce is vital to achieving the President’s goal of doubling electricity generation from renewable sources yet again by 2020,"" said Moniz."

With its announcement that it will hear the appeal of state bans on same-sex marriage from Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee, and Kentucky, the Court is doing that job. The country will soon have resolution of a major dispute over fundamental rights. Because the Constitution guarantees the right to equal treatment for all, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as marriage, the Court should uphold the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry. Some have argued that the Court should stay out of the debate over marriage equality. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jeffrey Sutton, whose ruling upholding state marriage bans will be reviewed by the Supreme Court, argued that the issue should be worked out by the voters of the states, not by judges. And certainly, as even Judge Sutton acknowledged, the country does seem to be moving in the direction of recognizing the rights of gay and lesbian couples to marry. Thirty-six states have marriage equality for same-sex couples. But what Judge Sutton, and everyone, should also recognize is that much of that movement is due to the courts rather than the ballot box. And anyway, one reason we enshrine rights in the Constitution is so that we don't need to depend on the political whims of our neighbors to enjoy fundamental freedoms. Even if the country would eventually get to national recognition of marriage equality through the democratic process -- and that is a big ""if"" -- the Court is doing its duty by stepping in now. Currently, our nation is a patchwork of marriage law, with many gay and lesbian Americans still unable to enjoy the fundamental liberty of marrying and raising a family with the person they love. The nation's experience with state bans on interracial marriage is a useful guide. By the time the Supreme Court decided Loving v. Virginia in 1967, all but 16 states had gotten such abhorrent laws off their books. It was unquestionably right for the Court to issue its unanimous ruling making clear that even one such state law still on the books was one too many. Such restrictive marriage laws violated the Constitution, and could not stand. The Court should follow the Constitution again in striking down marriage laws that discriminate against gay and lesbian couples. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees ""equal protection of the laws"" to ""any person."" These words protect everyone -- white or black, gay or straight, man or woman -- against hostile and arbitrary discrimination by state governments. Denying this equality in the context of marriage is perhaps especially hurtful. As the Supreme Court has recognized, marriage is ""the most important relation in life"" and the ""foundation of the family in our society."" When states tell gay and lesbian couples that their relationships and their families are not worthy of legal recognition, these couples and their children are treated as second-class citizens, regardless of the intent of those who voted on these provisions. In striking down part of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act two years ago, the Supreme Court has already decided that the federal government cannot deny benefits to same-sex couples lawfully wed in states that recognize marriage equality. Now the Court will decide whether all states must respect same-sex couples' right to marry. It has done the right thing today by agreeing to take the case. When it decides the issues later this year, it should do the right thing again and follow the Constitution, making history once more and finding that discrimination has no place in American society."

He donned the same type of yellow, transparent poncho worn by the hundreds of thousands of people in the area as tropical storm Mekkhala hit, with wind gusts of up to 130 km/h (80 mph).At a Mass near the airport, he put aside his prepared homily and delivered a very personal, emotional message of comfort to survivors, who stood amid puddles in mud-soaked fields and along roadsides.He told them that he had vowed to make the trip in November 2013 when he saw reports of the devastation Haiyan had caused.""I felt that I had to be here ... I am here to be with you, perhaps a little late, I have to say, but I am here,"" he said.The Pope, speaking through an interpreter who translated his comments into English from his native Spanish, said he ""respected the feelings"" of those who felt they had been let down by God because of the disaster but implored them to move forward in their faith.""Many of you have asked the Lord, 'Why?' And to each of you the Lord is responding to your hearts from his heart ... so many of you have lost everything. I don't know what to say to you but the Lord does know what to say to you,"" he said.Nearly 3,000 victims are buried in the city's almost half-hectare mass grave site. Hundreds are still unaccounted for.He asked the crowd to hold a moment of silence and thanked those who helped in the rescue effort after the worst recorded storm ever to make landfall.""This is what comes from my heart and forgive me if I have no other words to express,"" Francis said. ""PIERCED MY HEART""""What he said pierced my heart,"" said Maria Alda Panahustad. ""My house was destroyed by (Haiyan) and again by Ruby,"" she said, referring to another storm that hit the central Philippines last month, killing 27 people..The papal Mass was accelerated and the remainder of the program - a visit to a nearby cathedral, lunch with survivors and the blessing of a new center for the poor - was compacted so he could leave four hours early because of worsening conditions.In the cathedral, he apologized for leaving early. ""I'm sad about this, truly saddened,"" he said.The Vatican said he blessed the center from his car. He also stopped briefly at the home of a poor fisherman on his way into Tacloban city after the Mass.Minutes after the Pope's plane left for Manila, a jet carrying 11 people, including Philippine Cabinet members, overshot the runway at Tacloban because of the storm. No one was hurt but authorities closed the airport.A 21-year-old volunteer was killed when a scaffolding holding huge speakers was blown over by the wind, Leyte health officials said.Saturday's storm was an eerie reminder of Haiyan, which hit the same area with 250 kph (155 mph) winds and created a seven-meter high storm surge, wiping out almost everything in its path when it swept ashore on Nov. 8, 2013.Haiyan destroyed about 90 percent of Tacloban city, 650 km (400 miles) southeast of Manila. More than 14.5 million people were affected in six regions and 44 provinces.The government estimates it needs almost 170 billion pesos ($3.8 billion) to rebuild the affected communities, including the construction of a four-meter high dike along the 27-km (17 miles) coastline to prevent a repeat of the disaster.

Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) is expressing concerns about an anti-abortion bill that was expected to have overwhelming GOP support in Congress, National Journal reported on Friday. The bill would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life is in danger. Congress will vote on the legislation next Thursday, the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The decision protects a woman's right to have an abortion up until the point that the fetus would be viable outside the womb, around 22 to 24 weeks. Ellmers reportedly told her Republican colleagues in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday that she is concerned the bill would alienate young voters, who she suggested are turned off by the Republican Party's crusade against legal abortion. ""I have urged leadership to reconsider bringing it up next week … We got into trouble last year, and I think we need to be careful again; we need to be smart about how we're moving forward,"" Ellmers told National Journal. ""The first vote we take, or the second vote, or the fifth vote, shouldn't be on an issue where we know that millennials -- social issues just aren't as important [to them].""Politico reports that six GOP congresswomen, including Ellmers, also expressed concerns that the rape exception in the bill is too narrow because it only would only apply to women who have filed police reports. According to statistics from the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, more than two-thirds of sexual assaults go unreported. Ellmers did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment, nor did Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the original sponsors of the bill.The Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus reinforced the doubts Republican women are having about the bill in a statement on Friday.“Forcing women to go on-the-record about such a traumatic experience as a prerequisite to getting help is unconscionable, and adds to the pain of women who are survivors of rape or incest,” the statement said. “Families across this country don’t want politicians inserting themselves into these extremely personal decisions, much less defining whether a rape or case of incest was legitimate or not.""

In the wake of Thursday's nominees, Rock would have been the perfect host to counterbalance the forthcoming #OscarsSoWhite broadcast.Just consider how he started his monologue at the 77th annual Academy Awards, 10 years ago: ""Welcome to the 77th, and last, Academy Awards,"" Rock said. Unlike this year, where all 20 men and women nominated in the acting categories are white, the 2005 Oscars included five black nominees -- Jamie Foxx (twice), Morgan Freeman, Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo. (Foxx and Freeman would go on to win.) ""It's kind of like the Def Oscar Jam tonight,"" Rock joked.His monologue was blistering -- he torched Hollywood for its bad ideas (chief among them, putting Jude Law in every movie) and mercilessly mocked then-President George W. Bush. ""Bush basically reapplied for his job this year. Can you imagine applying for a job, and while you're applying for that job, there's a movie in every theater in the country that shows how much you suck at that job?"" Rock said, referencing Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" He later compared Bush to an employee at the Gap.But it was Rock's take on the differences between how Hollywood views white audiences and black audiences that seems particularly timely now.""A lot of Jewish people were mad about 'Passion of the Christ,' and I can relate,"" Rock said, referring to the charges of anti-Semitism that dogged Mel Gibson's film. ""Because I had to deal with a movie called 'Soul Plane' this year. I would trade you 'Passion of the Christ' for 'Soul Plane' any day of the week. At least they make movies for white people to enjoy. Real movies with plots. With actors, not rappers. With real names. 'Catch Me If You Can.' 'Saving Private Ryan.' Black movies don't have real names. You get names like 'Barbershop.' That's not a name, that's just a location. 'Barbershop,' 'Cookout,' 'Car Wash.' They've been making the same movie for 40 years. You know 'Laundromat' is coming soon. After that, 'Check Cashing Place.'""Ten years later, things haven't changed all that much. ""Now, when it comes to casting, Hollywood pretty much decides to cast a black guy or they don't,"" Rock wrote for THR last December. ""We're never on the 'short list.' We're never 'in the mix.' When there's a hot part in town and the guys are reading for it, that's just what happens. It was never like, 'Is it going to be Ryan Gosling or Chiwetel Ejiofor for Fifty Shades of Grey?' And you know, black people fuck, too. White women actually want to fuck black guys, sometimes more than white guys. More women want to fuck Tyrese than Jamie Dornan, and it's not even close. It's not a contest. Even Jamie would go, 'OK, you got it.'""Watch Rock's Oscars monologue below; an edited version of his opening appears on the Oscars' YouTube page."

The track won two awards this week, first at the Golden Globes and then at the Critics' Choice Awards. Common accepted both trophies, and his speech on Thursday night mixed good humor with some powerful social commentary:Thank you, Ava DuVernay, for making the first feature film about Dr. King so beautifully. When Ava first heard ""Glory,"" the first draft, she was like, ""That's good, but I need something bigger, like 'We Are The World.'"" I said, ""'We Are the World'? You talking Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, 'We Are the World'? 20 million copies, 'We Are The World'?"" No pressure, right Ava? Well, we knew the spirit and intention of that song, and we knew the spirit and intention of ""Selma,"" and of what Dr. King is about. That's love, that's justice, that's freedom. For all people. We created ""Glory"" in that spirit.Watch Common's full speech, which also includes a touching tribute to his father, below:"
