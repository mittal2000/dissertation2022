British officials say a mysterious virus related to SARS may have spread between humans, as they confirmed the 11th case worldwide of the new coronavirus in a patient who they say probably caught it from a family member. Officials at the World Health Organization said the new virus has probably already spread between humans in some instances. (AP Photo/Health Protection Agency)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cedec250000320036432d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kate KellandLONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have worked out how a deadly new virus which was unknown in humans until last year is able to infect human cells and cause severe, potentially fatal damage to the lungs.In one of the first detailed studies of the virus - which emerged in the Middle East and has so far infected 15 people worldwide, killing nine of them - Dutch researchers identified a cell surface protein it uses to enter and infect human cells.The finding, published in the journal Nature, came as the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the 15th case of the virus, known as novel coronavirus or NCoV, in a male patient in Saudi Arabia who died on March 2.Other cases have been in Jordan and Qatar, and in patients in Germany and Britain linked to travel in the Middle East.NCoV is from the same family of viruses as those that cause common colds and the one that caused the deadly outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that first emerged in Asia in 2003.The WHO first issued an international alert about it in September after it was identified in a Qatari man in Britain who had recently been in Saudi Arabia.A study published last month found that NCoV was well adapted to infecting human cells and may be treatable with medicines similar to the ones used for SARS, which killed a tenth of the 8,000 people it infected.In this latest study, led by Bart Haagmans at the Erasmus Medical Center in The Netherlands, researchers set out to find how the virus got into cells - which receptors it used - and then to find out where in the body those receptors were common.POTENTIAL VACCINES""Once you can identify the receptor and you know the distribution of the receptor in the body, then you can get more information on the pathogenesis (the way it infects people) of the virus and the possibility for transmission,"" Haagmans said in a telephone interview.Researchers identified the key receptor for the disease as a cell surface protein called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4).They also found cells containing DPP4 receptors were common in the lower respiratory tract but not in the upper respiratory tract - giving clues to why the virus causes illness in the lungs rather than in the nose and throat as a cold virus would.The findings should help researchers find ways of developing potential drugs or vaccines to block the DPP4 receptors and prevent infection, Haagmans said.A few drugs that block DPP4 receptors are already on the market, licensed for use in diabetes, but Haagmans said his team already tried using those to stop the virus in laboratory tests and found they did not work.He said, however, that the team was working with other molecules that might block the receptors and could form the basis for developing a potential vaccine.Initial analysis by scientists at Britain's Health Protection Agency last year found that NCoV's closest relatives were most probably bat viruses.Yet further work by a research team in Germany suggests NCoV may have come through an intermediary - possibly goats.Haagmans said since DPP4 receptors were also present in other species, including bats, his findings showed it was feasible the virus came from bats. He said the idea that goats may have been an intermediary also looked feasible.(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Pravin Char)"

When TSA agents pilfered your luggage, they spoke up. When the blueshirts forced us through inadequately tested scanners, they said something. When agents treated us like prison inmates, they fired up their laptop computers and they wrote.Today, those watchdogs -- and I include myself in the group -- are at a crossroads. Some of our closest supporters are gently advising us to give it a rest. They say our relentless criticism of an agency that is just trying to protect us makes us look shrill and unreasonable.Besides, every dog needs a break.I know that's true. I had an opportunity to take my sons, ages 8 and 10, dogsledding a few weeks ago in Lake Louise, Canada. Our two lead dogs, Linus and Sally, reminded me of the friends I've worked with who are united by a concern about the TSA. They want to move forward no matter what.Our guide told us his dogs would keep running despite their injuries.But if you're racing sled dogs, you know that's impossible. You have to give the huskies a break and feed them. A sled dog can consume between 10,000 and 12,000 calories per day. If you don't stop every few hours to allow them to recover, your team will get run down and lose the race.What do the TSA's watchdogs want? If you rewind to 2010, when the agency began secretly installing poorly tested body scanners in America's airports, and then forcing passengers to use them or face a prison-style pat-down, the watchdogs have a lot to be proud of. Thanks to their advocacy, the TSA quickly abandoned its ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to aviation security.Today, a select few passengers don't have to subject themselves to an invasive scan or a humiliating pat-down because the watchdogs said something -- even as others insisted that this was the price we had to pay for keeping America's skies safe. Yet a majority of passengers must still be screened in a way that critics claim is unconstitutional.We're not there yet Here's what the watchdogs want:Decommission all full-body scanners. The technology is unproven and potentially dangerous. The expense can't be justified to the American taxpayer.Fix the screening process. Every airline passenger should be checked in a way that is non-invasive, doesn't involve harmful radiation and respects their civil rights and the U.S. Constitution. We know the current system doesn't do that. Let's find something that does.Kill VIPR. The TSA's Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response team, which patrols roads, NFL games and political conventions, needs to be shuttered now. No one asked for these ad hoc teams of TSA agents and no one will miss them.Restructure the agency. The TSA needs to trim its $8-billion-a-year budget by eliminating a vast layer of ineffective middle management and reducing the size of its force, which is often referred to as ""Thousands Standing Around.""Retrain TSA's workforce. Frontline TSA agents like to see themselves as the last line of defense against terrorism. They aren't. Rather, they are the face of the federal government, and at the moment, it's not a good one. Agents need basic customer-service training, and they need to be aware of the civil rights and disabilities concerns of passengers.The TSA's critics have a vision of what the agency could be: rather than the paramilitary organization that strikes fear in the hearts of law-abiding Americans, an agency focused on excellent customer service that helps Americans travel more safely.I've seen glimpses of this organization from time to time when I fly. It is the TSA agent who smiles and helps an elderly passenger in a wheelchair through the screening area instead of barking at her. It is the more common sense security line afforded to TSA Pre-Check passengers and airline crewmembers.And I think: It could be this way for all of us. It should be.When it is, this watchdog will rest.By the way, after you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google.

A newbie to this mommy-and-me infant class, I greeted the discussion time each week with equal parts eagerness and apprehension. I desperately wanted to get to know these other moms, to connect with them, to make a friend. But, really, they scared me half to death with their angelic babies, their new mom glows, and their judging eyes.Slowly each mom began sharing their thoughts about motherhood with the group. One mom gazed at her baby with twinkly eyes and said she felt overwhelmed with love. Another mom gushed about how in love she was with her beautiful baby girl. And another said that she was amazed that her heart had the capacity to feel such (surprise!) love. From the sounds of it, I was shocked that these moms were able to tear themselves away from gazing lovingly at their beautiful little bundles of love in order to get themselves to this class.Then it was my turn. With sweaty palms, a fluttering heart, and a wavering voice, I said, ""It is all just so much more than I ever expected."" To which I received a symphony of deafening silence and blank stares.Maybe they saw the half-crazed look in my eye, sensed the signs of post-partum depression, and were afraid that they might catch it, like a cold or the stomach flu. Or maybe they really had no idea what I meant.But that was the only way I could think of to describe motherhood: more. More painful, more exhausting, more expensive. More vulnerable, but more protective. More fearful, but more purposeful. More isolating, but more unifying. More challenging, but more fulfilling. And, yes, there was more love too.I've always lived on the edges of the emotional spectrum. A highly sensitive child, I had difficulty separating another person's pain from my own. I wear my heart on my sleeve and often wish that my paper-thin skin were thicker and coarser because then things would be less charged, less affecting, less intense.But why in the world would I want less when there can be so much more?Because with more of this comes more of that. Providing for a family is more expensive and work is more stressful, but the pride that comes from doing those things is also more satisfying. Friendships are more difficult to maintain, but they are also more meaningful. The world seems more dangerous, but it is also more amazing. People are more complex, but they are also more resilient. Marriage is more work, but it is also more rewarding. Parenting is, well, more everything.Eventually I dropped out of that infant class after I met a group of friends -- real friends -- who were more fun than any pretentious class could be. Those other moms could keep their sugar-coated, gushy, twinkly-eyed love.I want more.This post originally appeared on the author's website. "
5,WELLNESS,How to Find Joy on the Job and in Life,"Frank Niles, Ph.D., Contributor

Ok, maybe not love, but at least like? If you don't, you're not alone. Eighty percent of employees say they are dissatisfied with their jobs. Responses to my recent blog post on passion told much the same story -- most would rather be anywhere than at their current job. There's lots of reasons for this -- boring work, office politics, low pay, controlling boss... the list is endless. Whatever the cause, being dissatisfied at work isn't good for you or your employer. Chronic unhappiness creates a host of emotional and physical problems and lowers our job performance. We also carry these negative emotions into our homes and neighborhoods, hurting the relationships we cherish most deeply.To break the cycle, sometimes the best option is to find a new job. If the environment at work becomes so toxic that it negatively affects your health and kills your resolve to wake up in the morning, giving your two weeks' notice may be the way to go. If quitting is not an option, don't despair. You can thrive on the job and in life and experience joy along the way by doing just one thing:Choose to be positive.Sounds clichéd, right? It's not and here's why: Choice is the ultimate expression of autonomy. It's the one thing we can control when times get tough, and it's how we remain true to ourselves. Famed Austrian psychiatrist and Nazi concentration camp survivor Viktor Frankl called this type of choice ""tragic optimism."" which simply means, ""saying yes to life in spite of everything.""When I share this insight with clients, they're understandably skeptical. Choosing ""yes"" in the face of life's challenges is difficult. Most of us would rather avoid the ""in spite of"" part altogether. It's necessary, however, to face our challenges head on. Avoiding or ignoring problems and the negative feelings that go along with them doesn't work, and actually makes us feel worse. Yet, we can't force ourselves to be positive. Becoming optimistic is not a matter of the will. It's a byproduct of purpose. We can only say ""yes to life"" when we know what it looks like and how to get there. We can only be positive when we have something to look forward to. Here's how to start: The next time you face a negative situation (or any situation, for that matter) ask yourself this:""What meaning can I create from this experience?""When we ask this question, something remarkable happens. We awaken to the possibility of the present, the moment-by-moment unfolding of existence. We begin to see every experience (whether good or bad) as an opportunity to impart significance to our actions. The disagreeable co-worker is no longer the person we tolerate, but someone who needs our compassion. The tasks we dread doing -- writing emails, leading meetings, and giving presentations -- become opportunities to develop discipline and skills and influence others. The long commute is a time to learn (audiobooks are one of the best inventions), reflect, and give thanks. These are just a few examples. When we approach life in this way, our focus shifts from the feelings of an experience to the meaning of an experience. It's not that we ignore negative feelings or pretend they don't exist (remember, that doesn't work). Rather, we choose to create meaning alongside our feelings. Follow the 4 R's here. Recognize your feelings (acknowledge them), release them, re-focus on your quest, and repeat as needed.So this is your quest -- use your experiences to become a better version of yourself and enrich the lives of others.This is how we create meaning. This is how we say yes to life. This is how we choose to be positive. Creating our own meaning fuels optimism because it gives us a purpose, a tangible reason to wake up in the morning. By living in the present, we also discover who we are, what we love (our passion) and what we can become. I recently had the opportunity to witness optimism firsthand. Last month, my wife and I bought a couch at a large furniture warehouse. After I backed our rental truck up to the loading dock, I met ""Ben,"" the warehouse manager.He exuded enthusiasm as he loaded the truck, so I asked him, ""What do you like about your job?"" Without a pause, he said, ""Not the money. I'm responsible for millions of dollars of merchandise and I only make a little over minimum wage."" He quickly followed up by saying, ""But I love furniture and I love helping customers find the perfect piece. And back here, I'm my own boss."" Ben went on to say that he wanted to use his experience to open his own business one day. Ben is a picture of optimism.He doesn't complain about circumstances beyond his control or wait to discover his purpose, as many of us do. Instead, he takes ownership of his life by creating meaning out of the moments he is given. He strives to be the best at what he does while helping others get the ""perfect piece."" This is his source of enthusiasm.The same is true for us. Even though our journeys may be different, the pathway to positivity is the same. When we choose to say yes to what we are given by living in the present, making meaning of each day, our experiences go from dread and ""I can't wait until today is over"" to appreciation and purpose. If you follow the simple (but not easy) steps I outline above, you'll be on your way to reaching new levels of performance and experiencing joy and satisfaction on the job and in life.I'd love to hear how you create meaning in your experiences and stay positive.

Bloomberg, who pioneered the 2008 requirement that chain restaurants post calorie counts on their menus, sees the soda law as another way to help those who can't help themselves from overindulging. ""There's one public health crisis that has grown worse and worse over the years and that's obesity,"" he said Monday. The obesity rate among adults in New York City is about 24 percent — up six points in the past decade but lower than the national average of about 34 percent. Meanwhile, the city's Type 2 diabetes rate outpaces the nation's, according to city data. Bloomberg has warned that people are killing themselves with sugar, which has been linked to Type 2 diabetes. A 16-ounce Coke — the largest size allowed under Bloomberg's proposal — packs 56 grams of sugar, nearly as much as two Snickers bars. Americans drink a lot more soda than anyone else in the world, according to a 2011 Euromonitor study. We also spend about $245 billion each year treating diabetes. Of course, many factors can contribute to diabetes and other vices may plague countries where soda isn't a multi-billion-dollar industry.

As a therapy client once put it:I can't stand the sight of him. Or the smell of him. I would rather eat glass than have to sit across from him in a restaurant and watch him eat another dinner roll!And yet, ironically, one of the most common themes that surfaces over time is a genuine difficulty moving on. One of the most common divorce related phenomenons involves couples who decide to end their marriage in the legal sense, but remain each other's most significant other for months or even years. As a therapist, I hear a lot about how hard it can be to truly, psychologically divorce. Many divorced parents take weekly family outings with their children and their ex. For some divorced couples, their ex remains the very first person they call with good news or bad. For many couples, this arrangement makes co-parenting easier and they frequently say it works for them. However, if you dig a little deeper, the challenge is that this arrangement holds them back in other areas of their lives. For example, a client explained recently:Rob never cooked when we were married, so when he is trying to put together a meal for the kids and calls with questions, I am happy to talk him through it. After all, it's wonderful that he's there for the kids in this way and branching out into things he never bothered with when we were married. Still, when we get off the phone I usually break down. I feel like I should be there with them, and we should be a family. Rob is clear that he is not attracted to me anymore, but as I lose weight and get in shape, I keep hoping that his feelings will change.Similarly, a client speaks of the challenges associated with dating someone who can't seem to emotionally divorce:I'm in love with Cheryl, and I want to be with her. But at the Thanksgiving program at her kids' school, she stared at her ex-husband the entire time. He's remarried with a new baby and she can't keep her eyes of off them. Then she asks if I would mind if just the two of them took their kids to lunch. I said okay but I don't know if I can keep doing this. I can accept that her kids are a priority, but I can't accept that her ex-husband is still so high on her totem pole.And another client wrote to me in an e-mail:I need to find a new ""emergency contact"" to write down on medical forms. I still put my wife... oops, ex!If the scenarios above sound familiar, it is quite possible that you are divorced on paper, but still emotionally married. If so, consider the following:This may reflect that you never wanted your marriage to end. Most divorces are not a mutual decision. If you did not want it to end and your partner broke it off, consider that it is never optimal to direct emotional or romantic energy toward an unavailable partner. Instead of torturing yourself by over-focusing on your ex, feel good about your ability to commit to a relationship and start seeking one with an available and therefore suitable partner. This may, instead, reflect that you did want the relationship to end, but you are conflicted about this decision. If so, seek professional help to see if your marriage can be reconciled. If you do not want to explore this possibility, keep in mind that your ex likely did not want the marriage to end, and you are sending mixed messages by continuing to make him or her your number one emotional priority. Consider that you are essentially pouring salt on his or her wounds each and every time you indulge yourself by reaching out. If you have children, keep in mind that your ability to get along and make shared parenting decisions is a strength that will reduce anxiety for your kids and serve them well.  However, if you remain each other's number one for years to come and continue to be legally divorced but psychologically married, this is incredibly confusing for children. It is quite likely that they will have a much harder time understanding and accepting your divorce. They will also be vulnerable to following in your footsteps by choosing romantic partners who are not truly available to them.If you are seriously struggling to move on, it might help to meet with a therapist who specializes in divorce. If you are opposed to therapy, watch the film Celeste and Jesse Forever, which details the marriage and divorce of a couple who are legally divorced and emotionally married. As art reflects life, it might help you move on once and for all."

A parent hears a different opinion many times per day about how to raise their child, from the media, other parents, teachers and child professionals. The latest hot topic is about allowing children to use or access online technologies and the problems that can occur as a result.  With the heated discussion around the revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), which is currently due to be published in May 2013 and said to include ""Internet-Use Disorder,"" expect that the flood of information and opinion is only going to increase. Articles and opinion pieces, by experts, journalists or everyday citizens (informed or otherwise) have focused on certain aspects of this proposed diagnosis and perhaps missed some of the key issues. A concerned parent would have a difficult time finding a source of any clear and accurate information about how to manage a child with problematic Internet use or how to prevent their child developing a so-called ""Internet addiction.""On one side of the debate we have those who are outraged that ordinary people who use the Internet daily will now be classified as 'addicts' and having a serious mental disorder. These authors use rhetoric pointing to 'hysteria' and 'prejudice,' while at the opposite end of the spectrum are those promoting this inclusion in the DSM because it legitimises the work of treatment centres and specialists. They use rhetoric which includes words like 'epidemic' and 'serious public health concern.' The remainder of the commentators are arguing about semantics, for example, whether the word 'Internet' accurately describes all online behaviors, such as video game addiction, social media addiction and online communication addiction.The moral panic and criticism within this debate is to be expected; whenever something new and radical enters social awareness, people commonly respond strongly and often attack those who hold a certain position, especially when they feel that their freedom of choice may be threatened as a result. While some of the tactics may be reproachable, this discussion and debate is actually a good thing; it means that people are engaging with the ideas and trying to develop and refine our knowledge about human behavior. This is exactly the purpose of including 'Internet Use Disorder' in the appendix section of the DSM with a recommendation for further research to be conducted. We cannot further our knowledge and treatment of mental health conditions without more accurate research about the prevalence (how many people are affected), the criteria for diagnosis (signs and symptoms) and the most effective treatment methods. It will take many years and perhaps even decades of research studies, case studies, expert debate, published research articles and more debate before this will become a widely-accepted category of mental health disorder. Before that time, we will hear much more from experts who will argue that it's not possible to be addicted without a chemical basis (i.e. illicit drugs and alcohol), from experts revealing the neurochemical pathways of behavioral addiction and also from those who will suggest that the cause of the problem is lazy parenting. However, none of this discourse helps parents or children right now. It doesn't necessarily help parents to argue about the cause of a disorder, when for a struggling family the most important question is ""how do I deal with this?"" Regardless of whether it's called an addiction, whether it's focused on the Internet or any other digital object or whether it's judged or accepted by other people, if your child displays a number of the signs below, it would be advisable to make some changes within your family before it worsens into something that could be classified as a disorder. The most effective treatments are preventative; unfortunately, often, the early signs are difficult to notice until the behavior becomes unmanageable, but if issues are addressed early then generally the results are more positive.  Signs of Problematic Internet Use: • Increased time spent on online activities • Preoccupation or obsession about online activities • Failed attempts to set boundaries or control behaviour • Neglecting important tasks such as school, work or spending time with friends or family • Dishonesty about activities or time spent online • Decreased sense of achievement or meaningful engagement in online activities (but continuing to do them anyway) • Increased emotional responses in association with online activities, e.g. guilt, shame, fear, sadness or anger • Physical changes such as loss of sleep, weight loss or gain, backaches or headaches • Attention changes, such as difficulty concentrating, trouble remembering or a frequent lack of awareness of time passing • Disinterest in other activities that they used to enjoyOnce these symptoms have been present for some time, children may become dependent on the online activities, and this would present as high levels of ongoing distress if they are removed from these activities. Secondary issues may then develop, such as depression, anxiety, poor performance at school or work, loss of social contact, loss of physical or emotional health and some very rare and extreme cases may be fatal, for example when a child or adult spends a considerably long period of time on online activities and neglects the basic survival necessities such as food, water and sleep.We have developed a global society where the Internet can be a medium for both positive and negative influence in our lives. The Internet has made information readily available to anyone who seeks to look for it; however, we now have multiple sources of conflicting and confusing information. The best advice that I can give parents is to know your own family and trust your instinct to choose what's right for all of you, to establish good communication pathways between parents and children, to nurture and guide your child, to support them when they make mistakes, to demonstrate daily that you care about their interests and wellbeing and to seek help from a professional when it's clear that they are struggling with something that they can't control on their own. The world may be becoming an increasingly complex place to live, however, parenting doesn't need to be difficult. As long as the basics are there -- love, respect and communication -- a family can overcome any challenges together."

In an effort to combat obesity, the New York City Board of Health voted to ban the sale of large sugary drinks. The controversial measure bars the sale of sugar drinks larger than 16 ounces at restaurants and concessions. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ceb71240000500094dfe2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If all had gone according to NYC Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan, today would have been the first day without super-sized beverages in New York City. Known as the ""soda ban,"" Bloomberg's legislation put a cap on the number of ounces of sugary, calorie-laden drinks available for sale in the city. If it hadn't been struck down, restaurants, fast food joints, pizza parlors, movie theaters and bars would currently be unable to sell more than 16 ounce containers of sugary drinks that have more than 25 calories per ounce. That means: sodas, energy drinks, sports drinks, juice drinks, slushies and smoothies, among other beverages. Exceptions include alcohol and milk-based drinks. But in a last-minute ruling, State Supreme Court Justice Milton Tingling dismissed the law, explaining that the New York City's Board of Health lacked the jurisdiction to enforce it. He further went on to find that the rule was ""arbitrary and capricious"" -- that it did not accomplish what it set out to do. Or, as HuffPost Live host (and resident legal expert) Mike Sacks put it, ""law-speak for too stupid to be legal.""Tingling made clear that the city's Board of Health was only meant to intervene ""when the City is facing eminent danger due to disease,"" he wrote in the decision. ""That has not been demonstrated herein.""But the mayor disagreed with this assessment, suggesting that actually obesity is an immanent danger. ""The best science tells us that sugary drinks are a leading cause of obesity,"" Bloomberg said during a press conference in which he revealed that he would appeal the decision. ""It would be irresponsible not to try everything we can to save lives, he went on. Adding later, ""People are dying every day-- this is not a joke, this is about real lives.""What's more, the mayor explained, the disadvantaged were disproportionately affected: ""Higher consumption of full sugar drinks leads to obesity and that happens much worse in poorer neighborhoods."" Indeed, research in the NYC Community Health Surveys finds that city residents who live below the federal poverty line are twice as likely to be obese as those who live in households with income at least six times the poverty line. And sugary drink consumption was highest among those who were obese or overweight. The city's survey also found that those who live in households with an income of twice the poverty level or less (in other words, seriously poor individuals) were more likely to drink at least 12 ounces of sugary beverage per day than were those living above the poverty level. Overall, 27.5 percent of city residents drink more than 12 ounces of sugary beverages per day. Nationally, a Harvard analysis found that soda consumption makes up 11 percent of children and teenagers' calories and about nine percent of adults' calories -- that's 224 extra calories per day. There's no question that sugary beverages are a contributing factor to ill health, but the question remains: would capping portion sizes truly work? The best research we have suggests yes: a 2011 study in Obesity found that people who were given an unlimited portion of soup -- via an auto-refilling bowl -- ate more soup and underestimated how much they ate, when compared to a control group who ate from a bowl that emptied, even though both groups had equal access to an unlimited amount. The research suggests that a lack of apportioning both encourages overconsumption and prevents people from estimating how much they have eaten. Of course, to make a direct comparison, similar work would need to be done using sugary drinks instead of savory broth. Bloomberg vowed to appeal the decision, while many New York City establishments are voluntarily enacting the restriction, including the Barclays Center.  "
