In the conversation, Rogers is described as an ""evil"" man who ""ruined a generation of children"" because his message to young children - that they are special just for being who they are -- leads to narcissism and attitudes of entitlement. If kids believe they are special, a commentator asks, why should they work hard and try to do better?Needless to say, this is silly. Young children should feel they are special, and they should be treated with the kindness and genuine interest that Rogers exemplified. On this foundation, we will then be able to teach them values -- the importance of effort, responsibility and concern for others. And they will want to learn what we have to teach.The criticism of Rogers is an extreme example of a common, more serious critique of modern American parenting. Many thoughtful clinicians and scholars believe that we have become too concerned with our children's feelings and not concerned enough with their competence and moral behavior. I share the critics' concern about the pervasive narcissism in contemporary culture. It is also not difficult, in our everyday lives, to find appalling examples of parental indulgence. But the claim that permissive parenting is a cause of the current epidemic of narcissism is questionable, at best. (Psychologists Jean Twenge and W. Keith Campbell make this claim in their 2009 book, The Narcissism Epidemic. The authors cite very few studies, however, to support this theory and these few have inconclusive results.)In her important book, Raising America, a history of expert advice offered to parents over the course of the 20th century, Ann Hulbert finds in every generation two competing traditions of child rearing. Advocates of a parent-centered philosophy believe, especially, in the importance of a child's obedience to adult authority. In this view, good relationships (and good feelings) follow from good behavior. Advocates of a child-centered philosophy believe otherwise -- that good behavior follows from good feelings. In real life, as Hulbert demonstrates, these are false choices. Feelings matter. Behavior also matters. Classic parenting research by Diana Baumrind established decades ago that children who are responsible and socially mature are more likely to have parents who are both responsive to their children's feelings and also expect good behavior.As parents, there will always be some tension between our empathic concerns (our desire to comfort our children, to protect them from disappointment, to help them feel better now) and our socializing concerns (our desire, for example, to help them work harder, respect others and learn the skills they will need to do well in life). Most parents struggle to find the right balance between these competing concerns. Our children are special, and our love for them is unconditional. Over time, we help them learn that success (and happiness) is earned -- by sustaining good relationships and hard work. Fred Rogers would undoubtedly agree."

It was clear and sunny, with light winds, when Asiana Flight 214 from Seoul, South Korea crashed just before noon, killing two passengers and injuring more than 100.Aircraft safety experts said Glide Path was far from essential for routine landings, and it was not unusual for airports to take such landing systems off line for maintenance or other reasons.But pilots have grown to rely on the decades-old technology, which is designed specifically to prevent runway misses, so investigators are likely to look closely at the issue.""The pilots would have had to rely solely on visual cues to fly the proper glide path to the runway, and not have had available to them the electronic information that they typically have even in good weather at most major airports,"" said Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the former US Airways pilot who gained fame with a successful crash landing on the Hudson River in 2009.""What that means is that then the automatic warnings that would occur in the cockpit when you deviate below the desired electronic path wouldn't have been available either. So we don't know yet if that's a factor in this particular situation, but that's certainly something they'll be looking at,"" he told the local CBS News affiliate.Glide Path is a computerized system based at an airport that calculates a plane's path of descent and sends it to pilots in real time.San Francisco International has turned off the system for nearly the entire summer on the runway where the Asiana flight crashed, according to a notice from the airport on the Federal Aviation Administration's Web site. It showed the system out of service June 1-August 22 on runway 28 Left.Kevin Hiatt, chief executive of the Flight Safety Foundation and a former Delta pilot, said it was common for airports to take instrument landing systems offline for maintenance on clear days. Pilots use several other instruments and visual cues to land in clear conditions, Hiatt said.""All of those are more than adequate to fly an aircraft down for a successful landing on the runway,"" he said.Sullenberger said the San Francisco runway safety area had been increased to avoid short landings.Airport spokesman Doug Yakel told reporters there had been construction on the runway recently, but not on Saturday.""Given that we had clear visibility today, we were operating under what's called visual flight rules,"" when good weather allows a pilot to see well to operate the plane, he added. He did not take further questions on the instrument landing technology.Former Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation Mary Schiavo said pilots had become increasingly dependent on instruments for flying. But she added that modern planes had plenty of systems for landing safely, down to a pilot watching the lights on the runway."

But an invigorating Sun Salutation or Virabhadrasana (Warrior II) could be exactly what your body needs to fight fatigue.Turns out, in addition to improving sleep quality, relieving stress and anxiety and improving overall physical health, yoga can also be an excellent natural energy-booster. ""Yoga works on unblocking stuck blocks of energy along the spine. You bring what the yogis call prana, or 'life force,' into the back and all these areas of the body through breath and movement,"" Vyda Bielkus, yoga instructor and founder of the Health Yoga Life studio in Boston, tells the Huffington Post. ""You're moving the circulatory system and awakening the nervous system -- basically bringing new life into the body."" Active poses that stimulate the blood flow through the body -- particularly those that gently stretch the spine -- can help combat fatigue and boost feelings of vitality, and might also help to counter some of the effects of long periods of sitting. ""As we sit throughout the day, the energy in the spine gets stuck and stagnant,"" Bielkus says. ""So when we elongate the spine, it energizes the nervous system. That's why the back bends are so invigorating. And when you're moving in a back-bending way, you're also bringing more emphasis to the heart and opening up the chest muscles, which really opens up the body."" Consider these 10 poses your yogic espresso shot -- a quick, effective way to give you the boost of energy you need in the morning or throughout the day. "

I was telling him about some of the intense challenges I've been facing and my underlying fear that I simply can't handle all that is going on (and what I fear may unfold in the coming days, weeks, and months). Theo listened to me with empathy and compassion, and then said something simple but profound. He said, ""Mike, it's important to remember that you have more than all of this requires.""As I took a step back and allowed what he said to resonate with me, I was touched by a few specific things. First of all, I appreciated his acknowledgment and reminder. Second of all, it allowed me to take inventory of some of the adversity I've overcome in my life, and, in doing so, it reminded me that I am quite resilient. And, finally, over the next few hours and days after Theo and I had this conversation, I got to thinking more and more about the power of the human spirit.In just about every situation and circumstance in life, we really do have more than is required to not only ""deal"" with what's happening, but to thrive in the face of it. As the saying goes, ""if it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger."" And while I don't believe that we have to necessarily suffer and struggle in order to grow and evolve in life, one of the best things we can do when dealing with adversity or challenge is to look for the gifts and find the gold in the situation as much as possible.Think about how this plays out in your own life and how it has played out in your past. Often we have things happen that initially we don't think we can handle -- sometimes these are things we consider ""bad"" and sometimes they're things we consider to be ""good."" Feeling overwhelmed is feeling overwhelmed, regardless of what it is we're feeling overwhelmed about.However, as we look back over the course of our lives, we can probably find many, many examples of times we were able to overcome challenges, deal with fear, rise above limiting beliefs, and deal with things we didn't initially think we were capable of. Another great saying that I love is, ""circumstances don't define you, they reveal you."" Ain't that the truth?Here are a few things to think about and do so that you can remind yourself, especially when things get particularly difficult or scary in your life, that you do, in fact, have more than the circumstances or situations of your life require.Remind yourself of all you've done, experienced, and overcome. Take some inventory of your life from the perspective of resilience. Think about all the times you've dealt with change, loss, newness, fear, pain, disappointment, failure, etc. and been able to work through it. You've also probably had many experiences in life where wonderful things and exciting opportunities showed up for you and you were able to step up and take your experience of life to a whole new level. Even though we're all unique, our stories are different, and we have varying personalities and life experiences, most of us have done, experienced, and overcome a lot in our lives up to this point, and by remembering this and acknowledging ourselves for it, we can create an even deeper and more authentic sense of self confidence.Remember that you have a great deal of support and you can reach out for it. One of the things that can get in our way when life gets intense, is that we sometimes think we're all alone. No one understands me. No one really cares about me. No one has time to support me. Regardless of our circumstances, relationship status, or family situation, just about everyone of us has some important and powerful people around us who we can lean on and who would be happy to help us -- if we're willing to ask for and, more importantly, receive their help. This one can be tricky for many of us, myself included, but when we remember that other people love being of service and our request for help is not a sign a weakness, but a clear indication of self care as well as a beautiful opportunity for people to serve, it can empower us to reach out and tap into the incredible amount of resource we have around us.Focus on what you appreciate about yourself and your authentic power. Self-appreciation and self-love, as I write and speak about often, are the cornerstones of self confidence and authentic power. Having a fundamental belief in our own goodness, power, and beauty are essential to us living an empowered and inspired life. While it's not always easy to do and can sometimes seem downright counter-intuitive, selfish, and arrogant, self appreciation is truly the ""key to the kingdom"" when it comes to personal empowerment and resiliency. Remembering that we are good enough just as we are and have all that we need within us and around us to deal with the stress, challenge, and uncertainty that is somewhat inherent to being human in today's world, is essential to our well-being and overall fulfillment in life.Regardless of what you're dealing with in your life right now -- however hard, easy, challenging, or wonderful things are -- you truly have more than is required by any of the circumstances and situations of your life. And, the more we remember this and live from this perspective, the more freedom, power, and peace of mind we'll experience.See more at: http://mike-robbins.com/you-have-more-than-this-requires/#sthash.m9UEZHoY.dpufFor more by Mike Robbins, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."
