0,DIVORCE,Why Celebrity Divorces Can Break Our Hearts Too,"Cristen Conger, Contributor
Co-host, Stuff Mom Never Told You podcast and staff writer, Ho...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-poehler-will-arnett-over_us_5b9c3feae4b03a1dcc7d5b6e,"When the Internet told me that Amy Poehler and Will Arnett are splitting after nine years of marriage, I audibly gasped.",2012-09-08,"NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 28: Actors Amy Poehler and Will Arnett attend The Comedy Awards 2012 at Hammerstein Ballroom on April 28, 2012 in New York City. (Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c3fea2100003300c50c98.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the Internet told me that Amy Poehler and Will Arnett are splitting after nine years of marriage, I audibly gasped. Then, as I stared at the red carpet snapshot of them with a Photoshopped rip down the middle, digitally rendering those comedy gems asunder, I wanted to shake my laptop and just make it go away. I could generally care less about who's shacking up with whom in Hollywood and shrugged my shoulders at the feverish coverage of the K-Stew breakup heard 'round the world. After all, stuff happens. People cheat. Love fades. Move on. But Poehler and Arnett's divorce news elicited -- I'm hesitant to admit -- a genuine emotional response of sadness. Sure, I've never met either of them, and until today I mistakenly thought they had one adorable red-headed baby boy, not two. Yet some bizarre pangs of despondence struck me because -- I'm even more hesitant to admit -- if there were a celeb couple I could pick to regularly invite me over to weekend brunch and share laughs and mimosas with, it would probably be those silly kids. Poehler is one of my favorite women in comedy, not just for her hilarious characterizations on ""Saturday Night Live"" or ""Parks and Recreation,"" but also for being an approachable, outspoken public figure on behalf of women and girls. She turned an ambitious feminist (aka Leslie Knope) into one of the most beloved characters on primetime, for one. Along with Amy Miles and Meredith Walker, she also started up Smart Girls at the Party, which encourages younger girls to ""change the world by being yourself"" and features an interview with Poehler and 7-year-old feminist Ruby. I could go on and toss out more examples (Broad City) and choice quotes (this), but you get the idea: Amy Poehler is awesome. For whatever reason, her marriage to Will Arnett, who's made me double over laughing I don't know how many times as the Segway-riding Gob Bluth, offered me some unfounded sense of comfort. Maybe it has something to do with being a smart-minded, comically inclined and feminist-thinking single woman that cozied up to the idea that there are attractive, talented dudes out there who are into us sort of gals. Or maybe it had something to do with imagining them just hanging out and cracking jokes and holding hands afterward -- who knows. Like I said, I don't normally get invested in the personal lives of celebrities, aside from an Internet-fueled habit of clicking on just about headline with the words ""Lindsey Lohan"" and ""nightclub"" in the title. A psychologist might tell me that I developed a ""parasocial relationship"" to Poehler and Arnett -- in other words, a fake friendship in which we eat bagels and lox together during the most magical and punchline-filled brunches imaginable. In the early 2000s, some researchers began digging into the psychological correlates of these A-list attachments and came up with a buzzy name for it: celebrity worship syndrome (CWS). A touch of CWS isn't unhealthy, and in fact a 2003 study linked it to extroversion, so nothing to worry about -- yet. More intensive CWS that serves as a form of coping or obsession may be a sign of neuroticism or poor mental health, but since I've never attempted to track down Amy Poehler and asked to babysit her children or started an ""Adopt Me, Amy and Will"" tumblr, I think I'm in the clear. One finding on CWS that helped explain why I negatively reacted to the divorce news of two perfect strangers is that people who indulge in celeb idolizing also tend to imagine the world as just and fair. Perhaps those parasocial relationships are a tool for making sense of our existence in a way. We find some relatable attributes as I've done with Poehler and derive a sort of hope from seeing that someone incredibly successful and at the top of her game can find a loving partner and build a presumably happy home. Some evolutionary biologists have theorized that it's an innate human behavior that drives us to mimic those around us with greater prestige. So when we witness a crack in that glossy celeb veneer, it understandably concerns the adoring public that had looked up to them, erroneously or not. Which gets to the ultimate irony of celebrity worship and these psychological attachments we sometimes form that spurs us to cheer them on, or, in the case of the Poehler-Arnett split, feel sadness or disappointment: we want to be like them, but we don't want them to be like us because it's a reminder of the universal, no-celebrity-exceptions truth that sometimes stuff happens, love fades, and you have to move on."

(AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d22f2500003600388c8a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A last-ditch effort by federal and state law enforcement authorities to hold Wall Street accountable for nearly bringing down the U.S. economy is unlikely to lead to any criminal charges against big bank executives, according to a source close to the investigation.Barring a ""hail mary pass,"" said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is still ongoing, the members of a task force President Barack Obama formed in January to investigate fraud in the residential mortgage bond industry will instead most likely bring civil lawsuits against some of the banks involved, though it isn't clear when these cases might come. That means any penalties for those accused of fraud or other misconduct would be measured in dollars, not jail terms. A spokesman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a co-head of the task force and the driving force behind its formation, declined to comment. Adora Andy, a Department of Justice spokeswoman, said in a statement that ""all appropriate remedies, civil and criminal, are on the table.""""As always, if working group members uncover evidence of fraud or other illegal conduct, we will pursue such conduct aggressively,"" Andy said.The subprime mortgage bubble popped more than five years ago, triggering a full-fledged economic meltdown. Since then, the question confronting regulators and government prosecutors has been whether the banks that drove the market's expansion simply made terrible business decisions, or committed fraud in order to reap short-term profits.The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a number of civil lawsuits, has alleged the latter (as a regulatory agency, the SEC cannot bring criminal suits). But with the exception of one failed case against Bear Stearns in 2009, the Department of Justice, which historically would lead any criminal effort, has declined to criminally prosecute those who created the financial instruments built out of toxic mortgage loans.By pooling investigative resources, it was hoped that the Justice Department, the SEC and a handful of state attorneys general, led by Schneiderman, could accomplish what the agencies had mostly failed to deliver on their own: a sense of justice, however fuzzily defined.But from the start, the task force -- officially, the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group -- has been dogged by critics questioning the seriousness of the effort, and by concerns that the legal timeframe in which investigators must bring cases is coming to a close.  Civil cases, if and when they are filed, could lead to large financial penalties and possibly aid for struggling homeowners. Yet it seems unlikely that such a result will satisfy those whose anger sparked the Occupy Wall Street movement, or even many middle-class Americans who may wonder how, in contrast to other financial crises, this one could end with none of the people who seemingly helped orchestrate it behind bars.""Without accountability, the unending parade of megabank scandals will inevitably continue,"" Neil Barofsky, the former watchdog over the $700 billion bank bailout fund and a frequent critic of the Obama administration's response to the financial crisis, recently told The Huffington Post.How and why the government chose this path will be the subject of debate for years to come. Some say prosecutors lacked resources. Others assert that the complexity of the financial transactions makes it virtually impossible to prove criminal intent in court, where prosecutors must convince a jury of guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" In a civil action, by contrast, the bar is lower: jurors need only conclude that ""a preponderance of evidence"" indicates guilt.One former prosecutor said a simpler human dimension may also be preventing government lawyers from filing criminal charges: the basic fear of losing a big case.""Losing has a chilling effect, because no one wants to take a spin like that and come out on the short end,"" said Cliff Stricklin, a former prosecutor who worked on the Enron task force and also successfully prosecuted Qwest Communications chief executive Joseph Nacchio for accounting fraud. (Nacchio is currently serving a seven-year sentence in a federal prison.)""[Losing a case] makes you wonder if there was indeed a crime, and if so, how you go about proving it,"" Stricklin said. ""It is a signal to the public that either the government is jumping to conclusions or isn't competent.""CATASTROPHE OR CRIME?Mary Jo White, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, adheres mostly to the view that the financial crisis was a catastrophe, but not a crime. Now a prominent defense attorney at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, White said she thinks calls from some quarters for more criminal prosecutions are unwarranted.""The financial crisis was so expensive and so many people were injured that one's instinct is to think that there must have been massive wrongdoing from the top on down,"" she said.But criminal cases must be built on compelling evidence, not suppositions, and evidence of broad-based misconduct that would rise to that level doesn't exist, White said.""I don't think the criticism is fair,"" White said.William Black, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and a prominent former bank regulator, is in the camp that thinks prosecutors have missed a massive opportunity.""They don't get the whole concept of looting,"" he said.Black, who worked with prosecutors to develop some of the 1,100 criminal cases that emerged from the Savings & Loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s, said that Wall Street accounting fraud flows from a simple recipe: grow by buying high-interest loans, leverage the business by borrowing lots of money and keep next to nothing in reserve against losses.""You are mathematically guaranteed to report record profits,"" he said.But those profits are based on a fiction, he said, one that costs investors when the bank collapses -- and in some cases, can cost taxpayers too.Financial firms like Goldman Sachs profited tremendously by purchasing loans described widely in the industry as ""liar's loans,"" Black said. These loans were made without the borrower having to prove income, or even that he or she had a job.""It makes no sense that an honest lender would ever make liar's loans,"" he said. Nor does it make sense that a sophisticated bank like Goldman, which runs an entire business based on the ability to calculate risk, would purchase such dangerous loans without knowing that they were toxic, he said.Indeed, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission produced evidence last year which suggests that Goldman Sachs traders knew these investments were more dangerous than they were letting on to their customers. Internally, they characterized offerings as ""junk"" and ""monstrosities"" even as they offloaded the mortgage bonds onto investors, according to the report. The SEC came to the same conclusion when investigating whether the bank had misled investors about a product known as Abacus. That probe led to a $550 million settlement in 2010.The SEC has won $2.2 billion in penalties stemming from financial crisis-related cases, though it has been dogged by complaints -- most notably from federal judge Jed Rakoff -- that its fines are too small and that it doesn't target individuals often enough. An SEC spokesman declined comment. Still, the agency's efforts to pursue financial crisis fraud far outstrip those of the Justice Department. The government's lone criminal case related to the creation of complex mortgage investments came in 2009, when a federal jury declined to convict two former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers accused of lying to investors about the soundness of the securities they were selling. Last month, the Justice Department announced that it had dropped a probe of Goldman Sachs, launched after the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that the bank sold investments ""in ways that created conflicts of interest with the firm’s clients and at times led to the bank's profiting from the same products that caused substantial losses for its clients.”There was ""not a viable basis"" to bring criminal charges against the bank or its employees, the Justice Department said in a statement explaining its decision. LAST CHANCE FOR PROSECUTORSObama's multi-agency mortgage task force was supposed to succeed where previous investigations had failed. ""This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans,"" Obama said in his State of the Union address in January. The goal of the new unit was to drill down into the sophisticated financial instruments the banks created to package and sell mortgages in a search for fraud. But the group was met with skepticism from many legal experts, who wondered how this effort would be any different from previous investigations.The group got off to a rocky start. Three months after its formation, it had failed even to secure office space. In May, Schneiderman told the Wall Street Journal that he wanted more resources and wished that investigators at his partner agencies would pick up the pace.According to the Justice Department, the investigation is now in full swing. More than 200 investigators are on the job, ""devoting significant resources to investigate and prosecute misconduct by financial institutions in the origination and securitization of mortgages,"" the agency said in a statement.The DOJ has issued 30 civil subpoenas in the past four months, it said, and the SEC has issued more than 300 -- though that number includes pre-existing investigations.The New York attorney general's office, HuffPost previously reported, is now investigating several major institutions. But if none of these cases yield a criminal indictment, who, if anyone, is to blame?Schneiderman, though he never promised criminal cases, is likely to attract some criticism for the lack of prosecutions due to his aggressive advocacy for the task force. Last year, Schneiderman led an insurgency against a robo-signing settlement shaping up between state attorneys general and five large banks. His goal, he said, was to preserve his ability to continue an investigation he had opened in the spring into possible fraud that led to the housing bubble and crash.The states leading the negotiations dispute that Schneiderman's ability to continue his investigation was ever in doubt. Nevertheless, his initial opposition to what became a $25 billion deal led directly to the creation of the task forceSchneiderman co-leads the task force, along with Robert Khuzami, the enforcement director of the SEC; Lanny Breuer, the head of the criminal division at the Justice Department; Stuart Delery, the head of Justice's civil division; and John Walsh, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado.Though each of these entities are sharing documents and resources, it is up to the individual agencies to file charges.The biggest challenge for Schneiderman, who took office in January 2011, was the ticking clock. Most mortgage bonds were packaged and sold in 2006 or earlier, and the statute of of limitations on most types of fraud cases is five years from the commission of the alleged wrongdoing.It is possible to extract ""tolling"" agreements from a business or individual under investigation that effectively extends the allotted time in which to bring a case, in exchange for more lenient treatment. But Schneiderman would have had to enact tolling agreements in very short order after taking office. It isn't clear whether a bank or an individual would accept such an agreement in a criminal case if they knew the statute of limitations was about to run out.It is also true that while the New York attorney general's office has the authority to bring criminal fraud cases, it historically almost never does. Like the SEC, the office instead typically files lawsuits with the expectation of wringing a settlement -- and political bragging points -- out of a Wall Street firm. It's part of the recipe that both Andrew Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer used to pave their way to a governorship.Instead, the attorney general's office typically defers to the Department of Justice, which has a large team of experts parked in the U.S. attorney's office just a few blocks away in lower Manhattan. But instead of taking on Wall Street's top executives, that office has focused on alternate cases -- such as the recent prosecution of hedge fund king Raj Rajaratnam, who was convicted of insider trading.Stricklin, now in private practice at the Bryan Cave law firm in Denver, said that he doesn't know whether there was criminal conduct in the run-up to the financial crisis.""The truth is more complicated than can be explained in sound bites,"" he said.But he has seen, he said, a decline in the talent level of those working white-collar cases at agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department, which over the past decade have diverted some of the most talented people over to counterterrorism.""The government needs to decide if it is really going to tackle white-collar crime or not, and if so it needs to allocate resources,"" he said. Otherwise, the result will be fewer cases, and more losses, Stricklin said.""It always matters to bring solid criminal cases where you are holding people accountable,"" he said. ""But the worst signal is not to do nothing, but to do something partway."""

4,TECH,Kindle Fire HD 4G: FCC Approval Still Needed,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kindle-fire-fcc_us_5bb3572ae4b0fa920b96b0b2,But they say it's very unusual for a company to announce major new products without first getting the sign-off from the agency,2012-09-08,"Jeff Bezos, CEO and founder of Amazon, holds the Kindle Paperwhite at the introduction of the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD and Paperwhite devices in Santa Monica, Calif., Thursday, Sept. 6, 2012. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3572a210000e700c7c508.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alistair Barr and Sinead Carew(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc trumpeted cutting-edge wireless technology as a key selling point for the fanciest of the new Kindle devices introduced by CEO Jeff Bezos on Thursday. There's just one problem: the devices have not yet been approved for sale by the Federal Communications Commission.FCC approval is required for wireless communications products, to assure that they operate safely and won't improperly interfere with other signals.A pre-order confirmation email sent by Amazon late on Thursday, September 6, for the $499 Kindle Fire HD 8.9-inch 4G tablet included the following note: ""We will send you an email asking you to confirm your pre-order of Kindle Fire when it is approved for sale by the Federal Communications Commission.""Amazon is accepting pre-orders now and plans to ship the 4G devices on November 20. A company spokeswoman said Amazon expects to receive FCC approval before November 20.Attorneys and analysts familiar with FCC compliance procedures agreed that the FCC is unlikely to reject the Amazon devices out of hand, or prolong the approval process past its ship date.But they say it's very unusual for a company to announce major new products without first getting the sign-off from the agency.""I can't think of an instance where a device has been offered by a U.S. carrier or an independent retailer that has not had FCC approval yet,"" said John Jackson, a wireless analyst at CCS Insight.An FCC spokesman declined to comment.The 4G Kindle Fire tablets are a crucial part of Amazon's attempt to challenge Apple Inc's iPad at the premium end of the booming tablet market.The lack of FCC approval at this stage is likely a result of Amazon's lack of experience with wireless hardware, according to Charles Golvin, a wireless analyst at Forrester Research.Lazarus said Apple Inc, Motorola, now owned by Google, Samsung and Microsoft have never had such issues.""These companies have dedicated staff whose job it is to ensure FCC compliance and they do their job very well,"" Lazarus added.Sprint Nextel, a leading wireless carrier, does not release phones for pre-order unless they have already been FCC approved.""In the vast majority of cases, we will not accept a phone into our formal lab process that has not already received FCC approval,"" said Sprint spokeswoman Michelle Leff Mermelstein.A spokeswoman for AT&T, which is providing the 4G data plan for the new Kindle Fire wireless tablets, declined to comment.FCC rules bar marketing of devices that are not approved for sale by the FCC. However, there is an exception that permits advertising as long as a disclaimer is included in the promotion, according to Mitchell Lazarus, a partner at law firm Fletcher, Heald & Hildreth, who has 27 years of experience obtaining FCC approvals for new technology, including wireless devices.Amazon's press release announcing the devices and the product description pages on the company's website include disclaimers saying ""The 4G device has not been authorized as required by the rules of the Federal Communications Commission. This device is not, and may not be, offered for sale or lease, or sold or leased, until authorization is obtained.""""Most companies try to get the FCC work done before they announce new products, so they don't have to make these awkward disclaimers,"" said Lazarus.Amazon may be waiting longer for FCC approval because the company engineered its own 4G wireless modem to be thin enough to slip inside the new Fire tablets, Forrester's Golvin said.Bezos highlighted the new modem during his presentation on Thursday, noting it was 2.2 millimeters thick.Most wireless devices have modems that have been used in other gadgets that have already been approved by the FCC, smoothing the process, Golvin said.The other new Fire tablets unveiled by Amazon on Thursday only have Wi-Fi and those devices do not have the FCC disclaimer.""That would indicate that this is related to the new 4G LTE modem,"" Golvin said.Lazarus said companies cannot accept orders and payments from consumers and they cannot ship devices until they are approved. They can accept wholesale orders, but they are not allowed to ship products to retailers until they get FCC approval, Lazarus added.(Reporting by Alistair Barr in San Francisco, Sinead Carew in New Yorki; Editing by Jonathan Weber, Gary Hill)"

Author of Swiped.

We need a paradigm shift in the way we see identify theft: the ultimate guardian of the consumer is the consumer.,2012-09-08,"Former President Bill Clinton addresses the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2012. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3572a1f0000250123d4b3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Was it excessive exuberance? Was it judgmental deficiency? Was it the thrill of hearing a barnburner by the President of the World? Well, whatever it was, it was a dangerous mistake.  Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention, during a particularly rousing segment of President Clinton's forceful and unabashed dissection of the Republican depiction of Obamacare as a destroyer of Medicare, an enthusiastic Democratic Delegate waved her Medicare card in front of a national news pool camera. The problem is that anyone sharing the moment either online or on television, or researching a replay of that moment, had or will have the opportunity take a long, slow look at a cornucopia of her personal identifying information and be in a position to use it for nefarious purposes.  At the very least, the video offers would-be thieves the opportunity to retrieve her name and her Medicare identification, which also happens to be her Social Security Number. While that may well be enough to begin the identity theft process, they need only go to a variety of other sources to acquire additional personal information to have a more complete picture of the victim.  I can totally understand the emotion of the moment, but that minor burst of unmitigated joy carries with it the possibility of weeks, months, if not years of personal pain and life disruption. But there's a problem that lies deeper than just this moment of bad judgment; in fact, this brief flash of television footage underscores a huge problem for all card-carrying Medicare recipients -- that they are essentially sitting targets for identity theft, whether they wave their card in front of the world, or if the card otherwise leaves their possession. Consumer advocates have railed for years against the dangers of using SSNs as an identifier for other purposes, and of the display of SSNs on any card that you must carry with you -- simply because it greatly amplifies consumers' risk for identity theft. The Government Accountability Office recently called for the removal of SSNs from Medicare cards, but until that actually happens, Medicare recipients will be left to fend for themselves on this one.  With all of the information floating around the brick and mortar, as well as the cyber world about us, combined with the hundreds of millions of files that have been improperly accessed since 2005 due to a pandemic of data breaches, there is little doubt that each of us will suffer some form (if not multiple forms) of identity theft during our lifetime.  Therefore, we need to create a paradigm shift in the way we see the crime and our continuing exposure to it. There are three distinct phases:1. Limit your risk of exposure: That means don't carry either your -- or your child's -- Social Security card in your wallet. Limit the number of debit and credit cards you leave home with (and always keep a record of the contact information in a safe place). Don't provide personal information to people you don't know by phone, in person or online. Use the most sophisticated security software on your computer, iPad and smart phone, and update it as much as possible. Shred all documents you no longer want or need which contain your sensitive data. Beware of phishing email (spear and well as general). Be careful as to the links you click, or pictures you open, even if you think you know the person. Never send money to people you don't know or money to people you do know, unless they specifically ask you verbally. Do not respond to texts telling you to call numbers that look (and will sound) official because you might be talking to Ivan and not Peggy in customer service or card security. Use strong passwords on all of your apps (alpha numeric not stupid  Like your birthdate), and don't share them among sites. Always spell the URL of every site you visit properly.2. Either enroll in a credit and public records monitoring program, or establish a set of personal protocols that require you to review your credit reports and Social Security Earnings Statements at least annually, your bank and credit card accounts daily and your Explanation of Benefits from your health insurer as appropriate. Also sign up for email and text notification programs with your financial institution, which alerts you to activity in your account -- in many cases in real time.3. Check with your insurance agent, your account rep at your bank or credit union, your HR department at work, or Student Services at your university to find out if they have a damage control program that can help you navigate the nightmare of an identity theft in the event you become a victim. Several insurance companies offer assistance to their home and auto policyholders; banks and credit unions have them for their depositors and members; Employee Assistance Programs provide help in a bundle of benefits and institutions of higher learning protect their students; faculty or staff as a perk of your relationship with them. Others charge various fees for different levels of service. You can check with the Consumer Federation of America as well as various other organizations to get specifics, as well as reviews of various programs.Bottom line here -- it doesn't matter how many laws exist, or how vigorously they are enforced -- your identity is your asset. No one has a greater stake in protecting your financial security than you do. And, the ultimate guardian of the consumer is the consumer.  It's good to be enthusiastic about a candidate and a cause. It's bad to wave personal identification cards in front of cameras."

On that day, Johnson took to Twitter to rail against the absurdity that the movie we were honoring is not available to watch in its original form. Lamenting that George Lucas, such an ardent supporter of film preservation, has done the exact opposite with one of the most popular movies of all time. Needless to say, I kind of like Rian Johnson.In the aforementioned ""Looper,"" Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Joe, a man who gets paid a handsome sum to kill people sent back in time by a futuristic criminal organization. (In the future it's hard to dispose of bodies, so these unfortunate souls are sent into the past to be executed.) This all goes swimmingly until Joe recognizes his latest would-be victim as his older self (Bruce Willis). Here, Johnson discusses the confusing aspects of time travel movies, revisits the polarizing ""Breaking Bad"" episodes that he directed and explains why the original ""Star Wars"" should be made available. (And, also, why the urge to tinker with his own films is tempting.)Time travel is a tricky thing. Was that always something you wanted to tackle? Yeah, I know. The goal wasn't to sit down and write a time travel movie. I just did it. For whatever reason, like 10 years ago when I came up with this idea, it happened to require a time travel, and I wrote the idea when I was reading a bunch of Philip K. Dick's books. I kind of just discovered him. And so I was blowing through all his novels so -- not that this was a specific reference to a Dick thing -- but I was just kind of seeped in this sci-fi concept world. But no, time travel was, I mean, I don't know -- it's fun, and that's part of the danger of it. You know, it's so much fun that it's tempting to want to explain and dive into it, and there are films that do that that I love, like ""Primer,"" for example.  Oh, ""Primer"" is great. It's a great movie, and a big part of the pleasure of ""Primer"" is digging into it, but this was distinctly not that, you know? The pleasures of this film kind of lie elsewhere. So I don't know, it's the sort of thing where I came up with a really complex, and, I think, pretty solid set of rules for time travel.  What were your rules that you made up? Well, first and foremost, and this sounds like a cheat, but, in reality, this is the only thing that made sense to me: I feel like so often the paradox element of time travel is approached from a chart perspective, or from a timeline perspective -- from a mathematical perspective where ""A"" happened so ""B"" happened so ""C"" happens. In my mind, it made much more sense to look at the universe and the way the universe deals with these paradoxes. To look at it as an organic body and to look at it ... it's almost like you push a foreign object into an organic body. It doesn't have a machine like response to it. It kind of figures out what it is and tries to do its best to adjust to it. And, so, that's why when the older self is back in the present, a physical thing, like a scar, that's kind of like more of a one-to-one simple thing -- so that happens and then that appears on the younger person. But, in terms of the memories changing ‑‑ and there was originally a longer thing in the diner, where the old Joe character went into this in more detail -- but the memories are kind of doing their best, and so it kind of gets really, really cloudy when things are still in flux. And in the present moment where they're defined, they become sharp again. But the main thing is, the memories are just trying to adjust and trying to figure out how to deal with this paradox. Which, to me, is how the universe actually works. You know, it's a big, organic mass.  I'm glad it stayed away from the whole, ""Don't do anything in the past, because it'll just mess up everything."" Exactly, yeah, yeah. And that was also part of the approach to it. And, again, it's the sort of thing that sounds like a shortcut, but, to me, it also just sounds like the way it would actually be, which is the scientists don't know exactly how it works. There is nobody who can draw, ""don't do this, don't do that."" They know it's dangerous and they know the less you mess with it, the better. And that not only seemed like a good way of just kind of explaining everyone's take on it, it also seems pretty realistic to me in terms of the extent we would actually know about time travel.  You mentioned ""Primer,"" is that the movie that does time travel the best? Oh, there were so many that ‑‑ I mean, the first ""Back to the Future"" is kind of a perfect script, I think. In terms of handling time travel the best, it depends on your definition. To me, that means it effectively uses it in the story. I think that I'm not really on the wavelength of people who pick it apart in terms of whether the time travel ""makes sense"" in the movie, because time travel never is going to make ... it doesn't make sense. It's just a matter of whether the system they've come up with is consistent and plays its role in the narrative without overwhelming the narrative. ""Twelve Monkeys"" is a tremendous film. And, like I said, ""Back to the Future,"" ""Primer"" ... the first ""Terminator"" is probably the closest model that we had, just because it's easy to forget the first ""Terminator"" as a time travel movie, because it so deftly sets up the situation and then gets out of the way.  For a movie like this, does having a lower budget actually help? It's got a gritty look to it that's cool. The fact that there's not a ton of special effects makes this movie better, in my opinion. I appreciate that. Well, I don't know.  There's a realism to it that I think if you have $200 million and you throw too much CGI, it's going to be like, ""Oh, whatever."" Right. Well, I don't know. Even if I had $200 million, I'm very wary of overusing CGI. I think it's a great tool and it can be used really effectively, but I feel like it does tend to be overused and especially in sci-fi stuff. It's so easy to create the shiny futuristic world that you do a virtual camera move through at the beginning. It's so easy to do that -- so it's tempting to do that. It seemed more interesting to me to create a much more grounded, recognizable world that's, like, 10 degrees off. You're right, though. To some extent, I wouldn't say it's a function of budget, but that was just the more interesting approach, I guess. I don't know. I also have no idea what I would do with $200 million. It seems like an ungodly amount of money. I think I would make eight movies with it.  What was the hardest thing to get your mind around? Like, ""OK, how do I make this part work?"" Well, honestly, it didn't have to do with time travel. The hardest part to me was getting the back half right, once we get on the farm. And that's where I put the most work into it. Actually, writing the script ‑‑ I hate rewriting. I'm so bad at it that I really try to discipline myself to bear down on it with this one ... to the extent where I actually wrote the script and I didn't feel like the farm part was working in the first draft, so I threw out the last 60 pages and just started from scratch with them. I really, really wanted to get it right, and it was important to me that the movie felt cohesive and that the themes drawn through from the beginning to the end felt all of a piece, even though there is this tunnel, kind of shift in the middle of it. And it was also important to me that it stayed as entertaining through the farm parts as it was in the first half -- when we're in the city with the sci-fi. So, I guess that was the biggest challenge for me: Just figuring out how to make that tick. And for that, I studied ""Witness"" more than I did ""Blade Runner."" Yeah, I actually went through and diagrammed out how they ... because I think ""Witness"" is a brilliant film.  Harrison Ford's only Oscar nomination. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, seeing how often they trek back into the city from the farm, seeing how they structured it. So yeah, that was actually the biggest challenge.  I get the feeling from some dialogue in this movie that you hate ""future clothes."" Oh! [Laughs] I don't know. No, I don't hate them. If they're done well, I think they're really cool. I just kind of didn't want to deal with them. There is a line where Jeff Daniels says, ""Why don't you put a rubberized thing around your neck,"" or something.  Yeah, a glowing collar, or something like that. Yeah. Well, the notion of it, just telling the younger generation to do something new without being ridiculous made me happy, I guess.  Jeff Daniels' character is from the future. Is his younger self cruising around somewhere? Well, Jeff never leaves that den. That's one of the restrictions and that's why he's always dressed in super comfortable clothes. I don't know if we even made this explicit in the movie, but he never leaves that den area -- although he has created this criminal empire ... so he's probably fucked a bunch of stuff up anyway.Joe, our main character, is not really a nice guy. No. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You root for him, but, at times, you're rooting for the older one -- but by the time the end of the movie comes, you don't like him anymore. And that was the other fun thing for me, is using the audience's moral compass as a dramatic element in who you're rooting for at what point. Yeah, and Joe's arc is very much ‑‑ again, looking at a non-sci-fi movie for inspiration -- is very much drawn to Rick's arc in ""Casablanca."" From Bogart's arc in ""Casablanca,"" where he starts as an essentially selfish person and ends up with this act of unselfishness. And that's why we named the club ""La Belle Aurore,"" actually, which was a ""Casablanca"" nod. But, anyway, who you root for, who you hope ‑‑ who your moral compass aligns with -- having that swing wildly, to me, was always built into the structure of the thing.  I remember the day my ""Star Wars"" piece, which you participated in, ran. You went on a Twitter rampage about how we can't see the original ""Star Wars"" today. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Does that make you angry? Well, you know, we all grew up as ""Star Wars"" fans. I feel like too often -- and look: Lucas ... it's his movie. If he wants, he can obviously do whatever he wants to it. And I love his work. I think too often the discussion about the special editions gets put in the ghetto of fanboy anger and ""you ruined my childhood,"" and blah blah blah. Whereas, I feel like there is a real, legitimate issue with it, which is ‑‑  The movie that was nominated for Best Picture, we can't see anymore. And this watershed event in effects. I mean, think about if we couldn't see the original ""King Kong"" and see that original effects work because someone in the '50s had decided that that looked phony with the stop-motion and they've rotoscoped over it with a man in a suit. Imagine wanting to do effects and wanting to study the work of those guys, wanting to see how it was done then and literally not being able to. So, it goes beyond ‑‑ I mean, it's film preservation, in my mind. And it's a pretty dire one. I guess we all kind of assume and hope that there's prints in a vault somewhere that will come out. I'm sure there are, but I don't know. And I don't know Lucas. I'm sure he's been asked about it. I'd be curious to hear his take on that, because he's been such a champion of film preservation. He came out against the colorization, so I know that his heart's in the right place about it.  His own words have been used against him many times. I'm sure -- and I'm sure it's something that he's probably sick of dealing with. Like I said, I love the guy's films so much, so much admiration. It just makes no sense to me that the work of all these great artists would be pasted over and then treated as if they don't exist anymore. I feel like just for film preservation's sake, it's an important thing.  But as a director yourself, is that temptation there? I'm sure there had to be a scene in ""Looper"" that you just couldn't get exactly right. But maybe someday it's like, ""You know what? I could fix that."" Is that temptation there? Yeah, you can totally relate to it. Absolutely. But, at the same time, I don't know. And again, that sort of leads it over into a creative rights discussion, which is a totally different thing. So, yes, that temptation is there. The argument against that temptation of once you put a movie out there, it belongs to the audience, not you, that's kind of an entirely different realm. That's a different discussion in the fact that this original thing that was created is something that is actually from a film preservation standpoint -- a thing of value and a thing that should be studied in the future and should be accessible. So, I don't know, they're kind of two different arguments. And, too often, they get melded, I think. Yes, the filmmaker has the right to do whatever he wants with this material he created, but, I don't know. I guess what gets me is just trying to make the original disappear. That's the problem.  You seem very embedded in the online community. The Internet likes you a lot. [Laughs]  But can that come back to haunt you at times? Has that ever happened? You know some journalists pretty well. Can that create awkward situations? Well, I don't know. I'm figuring it out as I go along. I mean, the truth is the reason that's so is just because it's a world that I really ‑‑ the truth is, if I wasn't making movies, I'd probably be writing about them. It's a world that I love and that I've been in since the early days of the Internet. It's always just been something that I engaged in and enjoyed, so I guess the answer is, ""I don't know."" I'm slowly figuring it out, beat by beat, I guess. And I know what you mean. And the truth is, like I said, I'm kind of dealing with it for the first ‑‑ you know, we're all kind of feeling our way through this new paradigm where we're all accessible to each other and we're figuring out how to make it work. I mean, at the end of the day, in terms of ‑‑ on a basic level -- I know the journalists and the film writers that I do know, they're really good writers and they have enough integrity to where I know there would never be anything in terms of journalistic ethics that would get violated. But, you're right; it's a complicated situation. I don't know. But I just, I mean, I love having conversations with smart people about film and that's where it's happening right now. And I don't want to have to disengage with that, but, I don't know.  You have directed two of the most popular episodes of ""Breaking Bad."" Oh, I don't know about that. I've been lucky to direct a couple of them.  The two that people talk about often. So, the ""Fly"" episode -- how does an episode like that happen? Because I just streamlined this show in July. Oh, did you? You just went through it?  Just went through it on my way to Comic-Con and back. But when I got to your episode, when you're mainlining it, it really stands out because this show moves so fast and then it's just comes to a screeching halt for one episode. I don't mean that in a critical way, I just mean it was so different. The truth is, I had nothing to do with it. They assigned me the episode  That's how it works? It's not like they gave me a stack of scripts and I picked one, they sent it to me. And when they first sent me the treatments, they sent it for the whole season and I started reading from the beginning so I did the equivalent of what you did. And I had the same reaction when I got to the ""Fly."" I was like, Oh, really? No plot, they're just sitting and talking? And oh, all right, well. And I had that same reaction a lot of the fans ... well, I don't know. It tends to be a very divisive episode and split people one way or the other. But the more I dug into it, the more I really appreciated what they were going for with it and obviously, we had a lot of fun with it.  You learn more about Walt and Jesse in that episode than probably any other episode. I mean, you're trapped in a room with them. You really get to dig into their relationship, and, I mean, the writing on that show is just so brilliant. But, creatively, I'm just there to make it visually interesting and keep things moving on set. It's really the writers -- it's Vince Gilligan -- it's just stepping in and facilitating their vision.Mike Ryan is senior entertainment writer for The Huffington Post.

The study looked at 168 stage III patients with non-small cell lung cancer -- the most common type of lung cancer -- who were being exclusively treated with chemotherapy and radiation between 2000 and 2010. The main findings were presented Thursday at the Chicago Multidisciplinary Symposium in Thoracic Oncology.While the study suggests a correlation between patients' survival rates and their relationship statuses, there were some variations by gender and race. Married women had a 46 percent overall survival rate -- the highest in the study -- while single men had the lowest, at just three percent. Married white patients had an overall higher rate, at 40 percent, than married African American patients, at 26 percent.Researchers, however, aren't sure why married patients have a better survival rate.The findings “suggest the importance of social support in managing and treating our lung cancer patients,"" lead author Elizabeth Nichols said in the press release. ""Patients may need help with day-to-day activities, getting to treatment and making sure they receive proper follow-up care.”Marriage has also been connected to higher survival rates in colon cancer patients. A study by Penn State's College of Medicine and Brigham Young University in 2011 found that married cancer patients tend to be diagnosed at earlier stages and received more aggressive treatment, therefore increasing their chances of survival.Keep in touch!

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c3f372100003300c50c46.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Credit.com:Wednesday night, in the midst of former President Bill Clinton's speech at the Democratic National Convention, the camera cut away to an audience member holding up what is a familiar sight for the roughly 50 million Americans who participate in Medicare -- a Medicare ID card.While that ID card was a great image of what President Clinton was discussing -- whether Obamacare would mean cuts in benefits for Medicare participants -- that simple act of airing a private citizen's ID card, which displays one's Social Security number as an identifier of their Medicare status, can seriously harm the identity of the citizen.In fact, the Social Security Administration even says on its own website that, ""The potential for misuse of SSNs [that] could result from the need for Medicare recipients to carry their Medicare cards with them is a valid concern.""The Government Accountability Office even suggested in August that Social Security numbers be removed from all Medicare cards because of the identity theft risk is poses to Medicare participants.The video of the DNC attendee was aired on multiple stations covering the convention, including but not limited to PBS, ABC and MSNBC. The full video of the speech, including the medicare card moment, are also still up on YouTube. The Medicare card fully displayed the woman's name and Social Security number, something that hackers can now use to steal the citizen's identity, according to Adam Levin, Co-Founder and Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911.""It's good to be enthusiastic about a candidate and a cause,"" Levin says. ""It's bad to wave personal identification cards in front of cameras, unless you are Todd Davis and Lifelock will handle your 15 incidents (or more) of identity theft for free.""But not all hope is lost. Here's what Levin advises this citizen to do immediately to help protect herself.""Now that her information is out there, close monitoring of her credit report, bank accounts and any other financial accounts is the key to discovering fraud and then beginning the process of resolving it,"" he says.The first step for any consumer who thinks he or she has exposed their Social Security number to the outside world is to place an initial security alert on your credit report, Levin says. This can be done through any of the three major credit reporting agencies -- TransUnion, Equifax or Experian -- and once you call one, you do not have to call the others. This will essentially flag your credit reports so that creditors know to be extremely careful about releasing any other information about you.An initial alert will stay in your file for 90 days, but that doesn't mean your work is done. You should be monitoring your credit report and financial accounts on a daily basis to make sure nothing seems out of place. The initial alert also entitles you to a copy of your credit report with each of the major credit reporting agencies. You can also monitor your credit using the free Credit Report Card or going to AnnualCreditReport.com to pull a full report one a year for free.If you spot anything hinky on your credit report (check out these signs that you've been compromised to know what ""hinky"" means), then you should file an identity theft report with a local or federal government agency to document that your identity has been compromised and then file an extended alert with the credit reporting agencies, which will remain on your credit report for seven years to prohibit identity thieves from lying in wait and then using your identity down the road.Seems like a lot of work? It is. But it can all be prevented by being careful about how, when and where you share your information. Showing your Social Security number and name on national television can be a costly mistake.""It is said that cyber security is only as effective as its weakest link. Human beings are the weakest link,"" Levin says."
