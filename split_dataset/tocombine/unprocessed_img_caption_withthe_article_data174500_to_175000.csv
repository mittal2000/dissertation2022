When you're being treated for breast cancer you are mostly in a reactive state. You're really carried along like one of those dance numbers where smartly dressed men in suits hold you aloft.It wasn't until afterward that I got a chance to catch my breath, when the drama receded. When it's not such an emergency and instead of thinking about dying all the time you start to think about how you're going to live.Now what? The truth is having had cancer in some way informs everything you do, from the smallest blueberry that you eat with the hopes that its antioxidants will tip the scales in your favor, to the relationships you have and don't have. Everything is reevaluated.For me, I kind of skipped through cancer because I was so supported and then when I had to step into my day-to-day life, I really felt the impact like an aftershock. I was a writer before I was a blogger and that is how I process my experiences, so it was a logical step for me.What is different about blogging [and] writing fiction or television?I really didn't anticipate the strong immediate response I've gotten from readers that were not women with cancer. I began by writing with my cousin and other breast cancer patients in mind. I thought it might speak to them and reduce the fear of someone at the start of their journey.But the readers who seem most interested in the blog are people whose mother-sister-wife-friend has had cancer. I think it gives them a window into the experience they may not have had. Also, the humor is an important part of my worldview. I swear that at the start of my treatment, I actually googled ""cancer humor"" and was shocked and appalled to find nothing. We have done a lot of laughing on this journey. I would very likely be bitter and angry were it not for my ability to see what is funny about it. No, really.Also, there were people who discouraged me from being public about my cancer status, and that just seemed wrong to me. I know that I have the ability to make this less frightening to other women, and nothing would stop me from doing that. Also it's a truth about me, the same way that I stopped coloring my hair (when it grew back), and people respond so positively to that. I think you are always safer in the world if you lead with who you are.How has it affected your faith?My faith was not really tested by cancer. That is to say, my belief does not have god in it. I have a strong belief in how we treat each other as human beings. That we have the ability to enact godliness towards one another. Having said that, much of how I have healed in this process was brought about [by] my religious practices and values.The members of my temple and my community stepped forward to feed my family and to care for us, as we have done for other people when they have needed our help. In the same way, the ritual of a Sabbath and setting aside a time for rest and to celebrate by eating special foods and drinking wine was very much what was called for in this experience. Much of this value emerged as I wrote the blog. I don't take cancer personally or feel that it has meaning in that way.People will occasionally post that anger will give you cancer, and I'm only really angry at the people who post things like that. Cancer is just cancer -- it's like saying that if a car loses control and hits you while you walk on the sidewalk that there's a reason for it -- the reason you have cancer is that you were walking down the street and your cells spun out of control. Done.How did you keep from being afraid?I wasn't terribly afraid for myself. I don't like hospitals or enclosed spaces, but I have Ativan for that. I felt confident in my doctors, and I was love-bombed.More than anything, I was really concerned about my kids. I had done a pretty good job of keeping their world relatively safe, and then I had to spring this on them. Also, I didn't want me dying to become part of their story. I have known a lot of people who have lost their mothers to cancer, and I was worried for my kids in this way. The truth is, they are very much in their own lives, but I want to be there for them if they [need] me, to jump on a plane or answer the phone or just sit with them, for as long as I could.I do know women who did not have the kind of medical coverage I had, and had to be fearful about money in a moment when they were dealing with a cancer diagnosis, which is unconscionable as far as I am concerned. When I'm done here, I'll blog about that.How do you cope with the change of energy?That's been hard for me because there is so much I want to do. I have had the wish, like Calvin and Hobbes, to have a fleet of clones running around doing my bidding. I have to take naps, but the truth is I have always done that. I haven't really scaled back what I wish to accomplish, but I have to be really disciplined about how I expend my energy.I have long joked that I should keep a stack of Post-it notes with the word ""no"" on them next to the phone so that I don't over-volunteer. I just have to work smarter and be a little more princessy. Waking me during a nap is a hanging offense.How do you control your thoughts?I am a big fan of cognitive therapy. I would rather meet Aaron Beck* than Beck. I struggled with anxiety when I was younger, and was able to really resolve it because of those tools. In terms of cancer, I was helped by this skill set. I tried to not go down the rabbit hole with fear. I have learned that being afraid is not a form of protection.Also, worry can exhaust you, and to get through this you need to be fit. I have, however, become smart about not getting tests done on a Friday. If you do, you can devote your entire weekend to worry. I get test on Mondays and schedule follow-ups on Wednesdays. Also I live walking distance from a bakery called Big Sugar and if used in moderation, one of their chocolate cupcakes can really take the edge off.*Dr. Aaron Beck -- father of cognitive therapy.Thank you, Racelle.

AFP PHOTO / Stan HONDA (Photo credit should read STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6b2a240000310094aab9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In last night's presidential debate, Governor Romney managed to offend me and other women in both new and creative ways. It was astounding, really. He made these seemingly throwaway comments that, twelve hours later, are still gnawing at me. Full disclosure: I am not of any concern to Mitt or his campaign. First of all, I live in Illinois, where I have yet to see a single campaign ad. Team Romney is not seeking my vote, nor does it matter to them. I'm an Obama supporter, which was probably clear to you after reading my headline.  That said, I am an interested participant in our democracy. I am the geek that will watch all three presidential debates, not to mention last week's vice presidential sparring. Every four years I indulge myself. Last night, in response to a young woman's question about lessening the wage gap between men and women in the workplace (it felt like a flashback to 1984, honestly), Mitt started talking about things like binders and moms utilizing flex-time to go home early and fix dinner. The thinly-veiled misogyny in Mitt's responses has me reeling. Why is it that women, moms specifically, need to go home and make dinner? Where are the men? Do men not eat? Do men not cook? Do men go hungry, waiting for their working women to tend to their most basic of human needs? In choosing those words and sharing anecdotal evidence of his progressive work place strategies, he both dates and outs himself. He makes himself the helper of women, and it is through his beneficence that moms can cook and tend to their families. Thank you, Mitt. Truly, thank you. Sigh.We need to embrace a culture that does not continue to restrict the duties of the home -- which are really very important to a family's well-being -- to women. You know who should be cooking and cleaning and shopping and tending children and laundering? Parents. If the family leaders -- either one or two parents, male or female -- make specific arrangements that one will work outside the home and one will work inside the home, all is good. A decision has been made and agreed upon. Cue the songbirds. If the finances are such that both parents, should there be two parents, need to work outside the home, do not assume that all of the work that must continue to be done inside the home -- IMPORTANT WORK -- will be done by women, specifically mom. MOM is not code for 'managing others' messes.' Last night, Romney revealed to us all his narrow, narrow understanding of the American family. To him, that is a husband/father, a wife/mother and a number of adorable children -- the more children, the better. If a family should lack a husband/father, that family runs the risk of children playing with AK-47s. If that family should include two moms or two dads, well, let's just not talk about that, alright? So much has already been said and written about the binders of women Romney commissioned. What I haven't seen is an exploration of how completely condescending and paternalistic that comment was. Here was Mitt, casting himself as the beneficent patron of women. Are we to honestly believe that in 2002, Team Romney could find NO qualified female candidates for cabinet posts? Really? And if was only through the helping hand of Governor Romney that women were allowed into the inner sanctum of Massachusetts governance? Really? I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men. And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said, 'How come all the people for these jobs are -- are all men?' They said, 'Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.' And I said, 'Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified?' And so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' and they brought us whole binders full of women.Apparently, I am supposed to be grateful to Mitt for helping a gal out. Um, no. I am not grateful. I am scared. Truly scared. On paper, Mitt Romney would love me. I am white, a home owner, a mother, my husband is the sole income earner and yes, I cook and clean for our family. In reality, I challenge everything he stands for. His positions related to women are alarmingly dangerous to my sisters young and old. They are dangerous to families, too, as women are such a strong thread in the family fabric. I will not cook for you, Mitt, but I may give you some of my old binders, which have been collecting dust since 1991. Seems like you need them."

One in 10 cases of tuberculosis in China cannot be treated by the most commonly-used drugs, a problem driven by lack of testing and misuse of medicine, according to a national survey that shows for the first time the size of the epidemic of drug-resistant forms of the killer lung disease. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6b192400005100533053.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"* New tools to fight TB being developed* Diagnoses of drug resistant TB laggingBy Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - New tuberculosis infections dropped 2.2 percent worldwide last year, but with nearly 9 million new infections, the World Health Organization said TB remains a massive problem that could worsen if countries shortchange funding to fight it.In its annual assessment released Wednesday, WHO also said only one in five people with drug-resistant strains of TB is being diagnosed each year, leaving hundreds of thousands of people who are potentially infecting others with this particularly deadly form of the disease.Overall, the report found that 8.7 million people fell ill with tuberculosis in 2011 and 1.4 million died, including nearly 430,000 people who were also infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.Dr. Mario Raviglione, director of the WHO's Stop TB program, said the report, based on data from 204 countries and territories, paints a mixed picture of progress in the fight against TB, noting that ""51 million people have been cured and 20 million lives have been saved"" since 1995.Raviglione also cheered progress in developing rapid diagnostic tools that allow patients to be quickly tested for drug-resistant strains of TB, and he looked forward to the expected addition of at least two new drugs to fight drug-resistant forms of TB in the next year.But the report cited slow progress in identifying cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis, which health officials called a growing health emergency.""On the one hand, we have existing as well as new tools on the horizon which could make a significant difference and even support dreams of elimination in some settings,"" Raviglione told reporters at a press conference.""On the other hand, we are at risk of stagnation if additional resources are not urgently mobilized by the governments of endemic countries, first, and if the international community then is not ready to fill the gap.""Despite advances in curbing the disease, the report said not all countries enjoyed equal progress.Cambodia, for example, has made big strides in reducing TB rates, with the number of cases dropping by 45 percent between 2002 and 2011. But the African and European regions are not on track to halve 1990 levels of mortality by 2015.INDIA AND CHINARaviglione said there were 60,000 reported cases of drug resistant MDR-TB from all countries in the report, with India and China representing most of those cases.MDR-TB is resistant to at least two first-line drugs - isoniazid and rifampicin - while XDR-TB is resistant to those two drugs as well as a powerful antibiotic type called a fluoroquinolone and a second-line injectable antibiotic.""India and China are the countries that need to accelerate the detection, the diagnosis and the treatment of MDR-TB in order for the entire world then to be able to progress, because they have the majority of cases,"" Raviglione said.He said India, China, Russia and South Africa represent two thirds of the world's cases of drug-resistant TB, and he urged those governments to step up efforts to test and treat patients.""If they don't move, we will always have slow progress.""One bright note is that past investments in technology are beginning to pay off in new and more effective tools.For example, a new rapid molecular diagnostic test for TB and resistant forms of TB called Xpert, being marked by California-based Cepheid, is being rolled out in 67 developing countries, with South Africa representing more than a third of that response.A big part of that is from a deal by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the U.S. Agency for International Development and UNITAID - a group that facilitates the procurement of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis drugs - to cut the price of the test from $17 to $10.""There is also progress in the pipeline towards new drugs and towards new vaccines,"" Raviglione said.""We expect at least two if not three entirely new compounds that kill the TB bacillus very effectively to be available in the next few months,"" he said.But WHO officials worry about a funding gap that could stall progress in fighting the disease.Between 2013 and 2015, WHO projects $8 billion per year will be needed to fight TB, and while much of that will be spent by affected countries, WHO said there is already a $3 billion funding gap projected in 2013.""Particularly serious is the gap for the care of MDR-TB, which will mean millions of unnecessary deaths in the next few years,"" Raviglione told the briefing.Dr. Grania Brigden, TB adviser for Doctors Without Borders, said the report reinforces that MDR-TB is an escalating public health emergency.""With barely one in 20 TB patients being tested for drug resistance, we're just seeing the tip of the iceberg,"" said Brigden, who called for more treatment and better drugs.

(AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6b1c26000035007f7867.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Middle-income households and homeowners in expensive real-estate markets are still the biggest losers when it comes to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's tax plan. In Tuesday night's debate, Romney offered up the latest rendition on his tax plan, which includes slashing marginal tax rates by 20 percent across the board and offseting revenue with a limit on household write-offs for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and other other popular deductions. ""... In terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be to say everybody gets -- I’ll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits. And you can decide which ones to use,"" Romney said. This cap, he explained, could be anywhere from $17,000 up to $50,000 and would offset revenue lost from a lower tax rate. Higher-income tax payers could have an even lower cap, Romney has said.But for consumers, a cap on mortgage deductions could hurt, especially in areas where housing costs are high, like California, New York and other metropolitan areas including Washington, D.C. For example, a homeowner holding a $500,000 mortgage would have interest payments that exceed a $17,000 cap, and that does not include other itemized deductions such as charitable contributions, medical bills and doesn't consider high state or local income tax. That leaves homeowners in high-cost housing markets holding a higher tax bill, Politico  and Bloomberg have both reported.. On Wednesday, Ezra Klein pointed out in the Washington post, ""A deduction cap at the lower level could raise taxes for middle-class homeowners who use the mortgage interest deduction in areas where real-estate values are high. And a cap at the higher level wouldn’t be likely to raise enough revenue to pay for the rate cuts.""Romney's proposed deduction cap would affect at least 13.7 million taxpayers. According to Bloomberg, at least 3.7 million U.S. taxpayers last year reported deductions of $25,000 or more. About 10 million others wrote off $15,000 to $25,000. Lobbyists for the housing industry are already ramping up efforts to keep mortgage tax breaks as generous as possible, the Hill reported last week.Meanwhile, all middle-income earners will actually pay more under Romney's plan, according to the study of Romney's tax plan by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax think tank in Washington, D.C. Even using the most progressive approach to closing loopholes, the study showed that 95 percent of Americans will still pay more taxes or around $500 more per year on average, Mother Jones has reported. ""All of the promises couldn't be met simultaneously without resorting to tax increases on households with income below $200,000,"" the studys author William Gale of the Tax Policy Center said last week about Romney's tax plan.

I don't intend to advocate divorce nor diminish any of the hardships that befall many people post-split.I do want to suggest, however, that the black-and-white thinking that surrounds divorce obscures some of the good things that never would have happened if certain marriages had never ended.So I have compiled a list of people whose contributions to the world were inspired by their lives being blown apart.1. Pema Chodron. After her second divorce, this world-reknowned Buddhist nun started her study of Buddhism. Had she remained married, it is unlikely that she would have launched the spiritual journeys of the hundreds of thousands of people who have read her work or studied with her.2. Madeleine Albright. The first female Secretary of State, Albright's perfect-seeming life exploded when she discovered her husband was having an affair. Albright credits the pain of her divorce to her transformation from university lecturer to political leader. ""I hated being divorced,"" she said. ""But I loved being Secretary of State.""3. Constance Ahrons. After her own horrific divorce, complete with multiple court hearings and even a kidnaping, this Marriage and Family therapist wrote The Good Divorce, a bible on how to divorce with dignity in the best interest of the children. The twice-divorced Ahrons has also voiced her criticism of Judith Wallerstein's studies on the long-lasting destruction divorce has on children. Ahrons believes that the children of these truly hellish divorces would have been just as troubled if their parents had stayed together because the dysfunction was due to the parents' mental illness and abuse. Regardless, Ahrons is a realist; she maintains that the traditional nuclear family isn't viable for many and that people can and do benefit from adding stepparents and stepsiblings into their families.4. Nora Ephron. Had it not been for Ephron's second marriage derailing when she was pregnant with her second son, there would be no Heartburn, nor Huffington Post Divorce section. Enough said.5. Eleanor Roosevelt. Although she wasn't technically divorced, she was a figurehead in a parallel-lives marriage. Her mother-in-law ran her house and raised her kids; her husband carried on with her former best friend. Devastated to learn of her husband's betrayal when she turned 40, Eleanor used the collapse of her personal life to catapult herself into the public, where she became a relentless advocate for the disenfranchised and one of the world's great humanitarians. Clearly, her famous line, ""you must do the things you think you cannot do"" came from experience.As for the things that have transpired from my own bad divorce: some days I can think of a lot of good, some days I can only think of a lot of needless drama. Divorce has put quite a crimp in my perfectionism and my compulsion to make everything look neat and tidy. I keep waiting for the day when I'm ""over"" my obsessive-compulsive self, but I'm beginning to think that day will never come. As Pema Chodron says:""We think that the point is to pass the test or to overcome the problem, but the truth is that things don't really get solved. They come together and they fall apart."" What about you, my divorced homies? Did any good things come from your divorces? "

(Jack Dempsey/AP Images for HBO)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c67c5240000300094a981.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What does America want? Do we want skinny people? Perhaps ultimately costing them their health? Is the school lunch debacle about our children's health -- specifically, the prevention of chronic diseases and the promotion of healthy lifestyles -- or only about losing weight? As of this school year, The National School Lunch Program has cut calories at each meal and has finally included more fruits and vegetables in the lunch line. According to the USDA:The Healthy, Hunger‐Free Kids Act of 2010 directed USDA to update the NSLP's meal pattern and nutrition standards based on the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The new meal pattern goes into effect at the beginning of SY 2012‐13, and increases the availability of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in the school menu. New dietary specifications set specific calorie limits to ensure age‐appropriate meals for grades K‐5, 6‐8, and 9‐12. Other meal enhancements include gradual reductions in the sodium content of the meals (sodium targets must be reached by SY 2014‐15, SY 2017‐18 and SY 2022‐23). While school lunches must meet Federal meal requirements, decisions about what specific foods to serve and how they are prepared are made by local school food authorities.However, the message we hear through the media -- and yes, from the students too -- is all about too few calories and being hungry for more. This calorie frenzy reinforces America's unhealthy obsession with numbers -- whether they be on a scale or a nutrition label. Are calorie maximums really essential when serving high-quality, healthy foods? Perhaps just getting Americans, specifically our children, to eat fruits and vegetables should be our major concern rather than calorie-counting! So please, America: Throw away the scales and stop focusing only on calories. Yes, calories are of extreme importance for weight management. But they are only of equal, or perhaps even lesser, significance than food quality. Raising happy and healthy eaters -- our students -- should (really must!) begin with high-quality, nutrient-dense foods rather than lower-calorie processed foods. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats are nutrient-dense foods. Foods such as avocados and nuts are nutrient-dense as well as caloric, but also are vital components of healthy eating programs. Proteins are also critical... Yet the new school lunch program limits students in grades 9 to 12 to just two ounces of protein at lunch (14 grams/protein/day). The question is: Should schools put a maximum calorie level on these foods? If so, should they raise the new maximum 550 kcals to 650 kcals for grades K-5, 600 to 700 for grades 6-8 and 750 to 850 for grades 9-12? Be proactive! See what the new school lunch guidelines are here. Let your voices be heard.Unfortunately, when children (adults, too!) feel they are being restricted -- and they actually are -- psychological rebellion ensues. Research has shown results signifying that daughters of mothers who restrict their intakes and/or put them on diets eventually fall prey to binge eating and weight gain. However, The National School Lunch Program has decreased calories on average by only about 100 calories at the lunch meal.[1] So are kids crying hunger because there are fewer calories, or because they just don't like the food being offered... and, consequently, are taking in even fewer calories?When trying to look at this new lunch scenario from an objective point of view, it seems the government and the public must make some critical decisions. Either allow individuals to be responsible for providing their own lunches, or focus on giving children quality food that not only meets the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 but also looks and tastes great! Can we parents expect a lunch aide to get our children to eat veggies if we can't get them to eat veggies at home? If there is simply a 100-calorie difference in students' meal choices, it seems barely significant enough to cause a raucous. Obviously, if students are not eating the fruits, veggies and grains that make up these calories, they will be hungry and wanting more food. So, if we can shift the focus on calorie-counting to increasing the palatability of the new, healthier foods being offered, we can stimulate a positive impact on school lunch programs. Perhaps even nationwide! Let's Move encourages the Chefs Move to School program. However, getting Jaime Oliver -- or even any chef -- to come to a school once is just not enough. Parents... Can you volunteer your time or recipes? Instead of salad bars, let's offer vegetables on a hummus platter, or even with ranch dressing. Research reported in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association concluded that vegetable consumption increased by 80 percent when served with ranch dressing. In other words, get creative! Pair these new foods with some older, more familiar foods or just fun foods like dips.[2]Suggestions to help you make good of the new No Hungry Kid Act:• Invite chefs to your school once a week, bi-monthly or once a month to teach lunch workers new and healthy recipes.• Have students rotate through the school kitchen to help prepare meals and offer new ideas.• Have children plant gardens and eat the food they grow.• Include cooking class in your curriculum and teach kids how to make healthy, tasty food.• Create yearly school cookbooks featuring the students' favorite new healthy recipes.• Teach students how to modify their favorite recipes to develop more wholesome, healthy recipes. When all is said and done, parents need to be the gatekeepers of their children's intakes. If you can financially afford to, send a balanced lunch from home half of the week or all of the week. Take the time to make your children's lunches. Help organize a committee to create change in your local school. Concentrate on what you can do with this new program rather than bemoaning its limitations. Americans need to change the ways they think about -- and eat -- food. Encourage the consumption of wholesome, less processed foods, and of course, don't forget to get moving physically to stay healthy and prevent disease. References:1.

The 231 total does not include two people who have a non-meningitis fungal infection from injections in their joints (as opposed to back injections), so the total of infections reached 233.In Washington, Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Edward Markey, a senior member of the committee that oversees business, called on the Justice Department to investigate whether NECC violated federal laws designed to stem illegal activity in controlled drugs.The NECC already faces multiple investigations by the FDA and several states, but Markey's request could launch an even more serious probe involving the Drug Enforcement Agency, which oversees sales of potentially addictive, or ""controlled,"" drugs. 'CAN'T ASSURE THE STERILITY'The FDA said Monday it was looking into two other drugs made by the NECC.The agency said it had received reports of a patient with possible meningitis who received an injection of a different steroid than the one found to have caused the deaths. It said Tuesday that one transplant patient was infected with a fungus after receiving a drug used in open heart surgery made by NECC. The FDA had originally said two such patients were infected.Another patient identified by the FDA received an injection of the steroid triamcinolone, also supplied by NECC.During a conference call on Tuesday with doctors on the meningitis outbreak, FDA official Janet Woodcock stressed that the two additional products had not been linked to confirmed infections. She asked doctors to contact patients injected since May to make sure they have no signs of infection.NECC said in a statement that it was reviewing the new information from the FDA.The FDA has been inspecting the NECC facilities. Woodcock said that based on the condition of the plant and other factors, ""we really can't assure the sterility of these products.""The legal threat to NECC also mounted as more victims of meningitis filed lawsuits.Lyn Laperriere, who remains in hospital with fungal meningitis, filed a federal lawsuit in Michigan on Tuesday. The lawsuit says he received an epidural injection of methylprednisolone acetate manufactured by NECC on Sept. 6 and shortly afterward showed symptoms of fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting as well as light sensitivity.Laperriere went to a hospital in Ypsilanti, Michigan, where he was admitted and began treatment first for bacterial meningitis which proved ineffective, the lawsuit states. He was later diagnosed with fungal meningitis.Brenda Bansale of Howell, Michigan, who also is hospitalized for fungal meningitis, filed a federal lawsuit in Detroit on Monday that contends she was injected on Aug. 28 and developed severe headaches and nausea on Oct. 4.All but eight of the 23 states that received suspect medications from the Massachusetts specialist pharmacy have reported at least one case of fungal meningitis.Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include headache, fever and nausea. Fungal meningitis is not contagious.The outbreak has raised questions about how the pharmaceuticals industry operates. NECC engaged in a practice called drug compounding that is not regulated by the FDA, which generally oversees drug makers.In compounding, pharmacies prepare specific doses of approved medications, based on guidance from a doctor, to meet an individual patient's need.A Reuters investigation found that NECC solicited bulk orders from physicians and failed to require proof of individual patient prescriptions as required under state regulations, emails to a customer showed.State pharmacy regulators have said that NECC violated its license in Massachusetts by not requiring patient prescriptions before shipping products.The 15 states reporting cases of meningitis are Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, Texas, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio and Florida.

It may surprise you that while luxurious surroundings are always a plus, it is not always my primary requirement.",2012-10-17,"First lady Michelle Obama waves as she is introduced onstage to address the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's 42nd Annual Phoenix Awards dinner in Washington, Saturday, Sept. 22, 2012. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c68992500003200360ddf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to spa-ing I admit that I am a major pain in the you-know-what. Bravo's Real Housewives have nothing on me when it comes to spa-ing. I can out-diva any of them (but in a nice way). I've never worked on a FLOTUS, but as an award-winning esthetician and international spa consultant, I know what I like. I can't imagine (sans security) it would be that different from Mrs. O. I have no problem requesting an esthetician who understands the needs of my brown skin and a senior or award-winning therapist for my body treatments. I would think that Michelle Obama's personal assistant would request as much for her. Why would anyone want less? Would your spa pass muster in this regard? There are certain amenities and qualities which I look for that would satisfy most folks, probably even a FLOTUS. It may surprise you that while luxurious surroundings are always a plus, it is not always my primary requirement. I must also mention that I am not of fan of the one-size-fits-all spa robes. Act like you know, and stock your locker room accordingly, please. Prepare properly for the ""bootylicious-ness"" that may be headed your way. Here is my personal checklist that I use before recommending a spa to my friends and clients.1. I want to be engaged in conversation and be seen as an individual. I want your therapists to be knowledgeable enough to answer questions about my skin and know what they are talking about. I want for them to educate me and delight me with information about some new advancement or offering at your hotel/spa that they think might interest me, and not just because it's the ""item of the week."" I don't want robotics, and I don't want to be patronized.  2. I want more than a perfunctory peek through the loupe at my skin. A good skin analysis can shock a client into becoming a facial believer. Skin can reveal a lot. I can tell from looking through my magnifying lamp how much stress, water, pizza and sleep my clients have taken in. I want someone who has enough expertise and life experience to do the same for me. 3. I want to receive the appropriate facial or treatment. Often, clients will book a service because it is familiar or sounds exotic. It isn't necessarily always the best treatment for their skin. I want a therapist who is sharp and knowledgeable enough to recommend what is correct, even if what they are selecting costs less. This is a sign of integrity and expertise and will always endear me, bring me back for more and inspire me to rave about you on social media.4. I want the correct and appropriate products used on my skin. I find that estheticians who have not been trained to work on ethnic skin cannot confidently select the right products to use. Because their references are European, their techniques may also be too aggressive. Having a skincare professional cause hyperpigmentation (dark marks) is inexcusable and a direct result of insufficient training. I want to be able to trust my facialist enough to doze off and wake up with my skin glowing, not damaged. 5. I want recommendations for home care. Recommending a home care program or product means that you are invested enough in me as your client to want my skin to look good post-service. A clever therapist knows that product sales are a way to stay connected to the client. I personally love receiving follow-up calls or notes inquiring about my skin. One of my therapists from the Oberoi Rajvilas in India checks in with me frequently on Facebook. She will be my first stop when I'm in that part of the world again. So, for all of the above-mentioned qualities, how many did your spa meet? If the number is three or less, then maybe it's time to redirect your renovation budget, stop slapping gold leaf on everything and reset. Think about investing more of your money and time in staff training. After all, you never know when the FLOTUS might decide to visit.Linda Harding is President of Moontide Consulting.."

Lifestyle and career blog",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/personal-finance-tips_us_5b9c6abde4b03a1dcc7e7a73,"We don't necessarily believe these things should be free, but we think a normal person who works for a living should have certain things and be able to afford to do certain things.",2012-10-17,Young woman with a piggy bank and using a calculator,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6abd26000036007f784b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Growing up in the U.S. in this period of time has given most of us a relatively impaired view of ourselves. We grow up believing strongly in our rights, but those rights have little to do with what's allowed and a lot more to do with what we think the world owes us for merely existing.We don't necessarily believe these things should be free, but we think a normal person who works for a living should have certain things and be able to afford to do certain things.Yet some of the things we think we're owed end up leading us into debt -- things we might actually be able to live without. Here are a few examples:VehiclesAt some point, a car went from being a long-distance transportation device to being a substitute for legs. We don't just use the car to visit relatives 30 miles away; we take it to work a couple of miles away or to the grocery store down the street.If we find ourselves without a car, we feel trapped. We consider it to be a ""fixed cost"" of life, so we figure we'll just have to take out a loan to buy one. We now care more about the ownership of a car than its intended use, which was to facilitate necessary (relatively) long-distance travel. Sure, cars allow people to commute further to work, but those of us who don't actually go far for work, or don't get paid enough to make up the cost of the vehicle, might just be throwing money out the window.Food and HealthAmericans eat out more than any other people on earth, and as a result, we're also the least healthy. We think being hungry is occasion enough to go to the nearest burger joint and drop $10 for a meal that probably racks up another $10 in medical bills in the long run. Not only do we think this is acceptable, we think it's normal.We assume that growing fresh food in the backyard is for ""granolas"" and gardening hobbyists. Cooking is a rare skill only held by people who studied that sort of thing, and eating vegetables is for rabbits and vegans. We demand to subsist on processed corn derivatives and pulped animals because they're ""tasty."" The result -- besides a food bill that's five or six times higher than that of someone who cooks their own food -- is a lifetime cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars in over-the-counter pills and more serious medical treatments for our failing livers, hearts and arteries.EntertainmentMany of us spend our time at work trying to make the world more efficient. We work to make systems work better, to add new innovations, and to remove dead weight where we can.Yet when we leave work and come home, we leave that philosophy behind. Somehow we consider things like a big-screen TV, the latest video games, cable service and an awesome sound system to be required in the same way that a dining table, chairs, and a frying pan might be. We never consider that we might better substitute things that could actually save us money, make us healthier, or help us become more competitive as employees. This is surprising since the list for such pursuits is incredibly long, including anything from playing sports to gardening to studying a foreign language or starting our own business on the side.EducationThis is a big one -- we think going to college is our right. We don't really worry about how much it costs or how much money our degree will help us make later in life; we just sort of assume the cost will take care of itself and someone will hire us and give us lots of money for our ability to drink 15 PBRs and still flawlessly quote Voltaire.No one bothers to consider that the four years you spent in a drunken stupor could have been spent learning a useful trade and contributing to society. As an experienced plumber, you could have a permanent job making $50,000 a year, with zero debt and a nice chunk of change already saved up in that time; yet somehow an unemployed graduate with a degree living in destitution, massive debt and with no employable skills at all has the nerve to look down on such people.If we were to let go of our ridiculous ideas about what we're entitled to and what's ""normal"" for us as Americans, we could begin to shake off the shackles of our creditors. If you don't borrow money, you don't have to pay interest, which is why the quickest way to debt-free living is not to take out major loans in the first place and to match your standard of living to your income (or beneath it).Alan Brady is a passionate blogger who spends his time researching and writing about the economy, recent job market trends and business.
