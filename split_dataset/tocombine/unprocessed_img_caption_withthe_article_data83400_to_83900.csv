2,IMPACT,New Cartoon Video Demystifies Ebola,"Georgianne Nienaber, ContributorWriter and author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-cartoon-video-demysti_b_7797046.html,"The Global Health Media Project has produced a cartoon video, The Story of Ebola. The video presents the Ebola virus in scientific, yet understandable terms for West African countries still facing the viral threat.",2015-07-19,2015-07-14-1436907288-5144406-9f334d5d7cff497999c75edaed78c724.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-14-1436907288-5144406-9f334d5d7cff497999c75edaed78c724-thumb.jpg,"Remember the panic that ensued when the United States encountered its first cases of Ebola? Despite the parade of experts across our First World television screens, misinformation, fear and confusion spread faster than the virus. Imagine how a family living in a small village in Western Africa feels to see health workers clad in dehumanizing protective gear descending upon their homes. Reach deep for empathy for the family whose loved one was wrapped in a body bag and hauled away with no traditional ceremony. Consider the fear and confusion that clouds judgment and results in reactions that give a virus undeserved power.The Global Health Media Project has produced a cartoon video, The Story of Ebola, in collaboration with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), UNICEF, and award-winning cartoonist Yoni Goodman. The video presents the Ebola virus in scientific, yet understandable terms for West African countries still facing the viral threat.The challenge was to relate the concept of an ""invisible germ"" as something that can be fought through understanding of how Ebola is spread. Preventive behavior is the key to winning the fight against Ebola. Ebola is small. Ebola is a germ. It is not a superhuman entity. Villagers have the power to take control of this disease, and the Story of Ebola tells them how to accomplish this.In an email conversation Deborah Van Dyke, Director of the Global Health Media Project, said ""We set the narrative in the communities where people are at risk so the story feels like it's about them, relatable."" Currently translated in French, Portuguese, Swahili, Kissi, Krio, Thembe, and Fular, the goal is to provide voice-overs in those and in a number of other West African languages as funds become available.The Story of Ebola is skillfully presented through the eyes of a young girl whose revered grandfather dies from the virus. The family is confused, frightened and saddened when the grandfather is taken away without the benefit of a traditional burial. This is a double loss. The health care worker, who is from the community and thankfully not a foreigner, explains how Ebola is spread and how a simple thing like regular hand-washing is a vital tool in prevention.The visuals are simple, direct and clearly understood. Purple coloring is a stand-in for the invisible virus, making it real, but less frightening. Seeing is believing. Knowledge is power. The girl's mother also contracts Ebola, but because she is treated early, survives. The drama ensues when her parents initially decide to run away, fearing that the health care workers are the source of death, instead of the virus. The young girl is the heroine of the film, convincing her frightened parents to go to the clinic immediately. Of course, the mother survives.I especially like the animated visual of the sun rising and setting to represent the passage of time. It is a very African concept. The connection with nature is soothing in the midst of the frightening drama that unfolds. The end result is that a complicated scientific message is delivered in an easy to understand format.Ebola has not been eliminated. Just this week, the New York Times reported that a young woman died hours after being admitted to an Ebola treatment unit in Liberia. This was the second Ebola fatality since Liberia was declared free of the virus on May 9. Six Liberians have been infected since then.""The new cases in Liberia show us that that our efforts should not be focussed on becoming Ebola-free, but on staying Ebola-free,"" said Savita Naqvi, UNICEF Regional Advisor on Communications for Development in a press release. ""It's not over yet and no one should drop their guard. We need to continue working with communities, keeping them engaged and vigilant, even beyond zero new cases.""Correction: Translations, but not productions, have been completed in other languages, as noted in original post."
3,BUSINESS,The Art of Storytelling - 7 Lessons From Cartoonist Liza Donnelly,"Vala Afshar, ContributorChief Digital Evangelist, Salesforce",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-art-of-storytelling_b_7827738.html,"Liza Donnelly is a cartoonist and writer with The New Yorker Magazine, where she has been drawing cartoons about culture and politics for over thirty years.",2015-07-19,2015-07-19-1437320146-1799952-119_liza_donnelly_v1.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-19-1437320146-1799952-119_liza_donnelly_v1-thumb.png,"There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you. ― Maya Angelou Liza Donnelly is a cartoonist and writer with The New Yorker Magazine, where she has been drawing cartoons about culture and politics for over thirty years. Donnelly's work has appeared in many national publications and she truly is one of the top cartoonists in the world. Liza Donnelly is also the author of fifteen books and an experienced public speaker, speaking at the United Nations and the first TED Women conference.  Liza Donnelly, Cartoonist - The New Yorker Magazine Donnelly (Twiiter: @lizadonnelly) started drawing when she was little as a coping mechanism and to help make people happy. After graduating from college, Donnelly moved to New York City and worked at a museum, while submitting cartoons to the New Yorker, and within two years, Donnelly sold her first cartoon. I asked Donnelly to give us advice about the art of effective storytelling. Here are 10 ways to improve the art of storytelling:1. A good story has a beginning, a compelling middle and an endDonnelly says:I usually do single panel cartoons - a single image. In a good cartoon, the beginning and end are implied. What you're seeing is the middle of the story. You can see the back story and you can see where these people came from, and where they're going.2. A good storyteller is a great collaborator  As a cartoonist I work with my world around me, I work with the people around me. I rely on knowing what's going on around me and using it. I use what I see and what I sense and what I hear. 3. Good stories inspire and ignite reflection  Rarely do we cartoonists use phrases verbatim on people. People think we go to cocktail parties and you know eavesdrop. We don't do that. We're like sponges in a way, we pick up what's going on around us and soak up either knowingly or subconsciously and squeeze it back out. Donnelly's cartoons do have an ulterior motive. She draws cartoons hoping to get people to think about what they are doing, or to take note of something that they are doing that might be funny or wrong.4. Share stories that are important and matter to you  I try to draw about everything that I can, mostly about American life or about Americans, people in this country. I'm focusing more on women's rights because I feel like the kind of cartoon I do can get at things going on in our culture that you might not be able to get from an article, or a traditional political cartoon.5. Great storytellers know their characters It is better to be informed than opinionated. Although I do it intuitively and I go to the same people, characters that I feel comfortable with that I know something about. Most of my cartoons are making fun of my demographic, because I know my demographic and you have got to draw or write about what you know otherwise it might ring false.6. Great storytellers are able to create stories with a twist The first cartoon Donnelly sold to the New Yorker Magazine was a caption less cartoon with a twist. Paul Cezanne, the artist has a theory of three elements in nature a cone, a sphere, a cylinder. That's what he bases his art theories on, and so I just come out of art school, you know art school, so I drew a cone, a sphere, and a cylinder that's the given, and I added to the picture a TV set.7. Humor is a powerful tool in storytelling Referencing her TED talk, Donnelly spoke about the power of humor in storytelling. Women plus humor equals change, what I meant by that was that humor is a powerful tool. If you go to anybody doing stand-up, they are in a powerful position. They're standing on that stage and they have control of their audience.Donnelly concluded our interview by drawing a cartoon live. Drawing a live cartoon by one of the top cartoonist in the world was truly an extraordinary experience - perhaps one of my favorite moments of any show we've ever done since we started in 2013 (this was episode 119).

4,IMPACT,She Dreamed of Africa -- And Then She Was Sent There,"Sidonie Sawyer, ContributorBorn in France, immigrated to the USA / Features and Travel Wr...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/she-dreamed-of-africa--an_b_7827858.html,"My daughter joined the Peace Corps last year, right after graduating from college in Florida, with an International Affairs degree.

She wants to be a diplomat. After having trekked the World with me during her childhood, she was still dreaming of Africa: the culture, the music, the food, the spirits, the ancestors 'beliefs, the fabrics, everything was always drawing her to Africa.When still in school, she decided to apply to the Peace Corps and tempt fate to see where she would be shipped to, if accepted. The odds of being sent to Africa were slim, as the wonderful program has a presence in hundreds of locations around the planet.Still, she liked the opportunity to do some good, learn many things, and live in a foreign country for a little while - a while that is in fact quite not so little, as a commitment of 27 months is required of all applicants. Yes, that's two years and three months.The Application Process.For months she studied the purpose and intent of the federal program; she filled out paperwork, wrote essays, letters, forms. She gathered tons of information from her past 20 years in this world. She waited anxiously for an answer.It came in April - she was accepted in the Peace Corps program! She still had no idea where on Earth she would be asked to make a life for the next two and more years of her young existence. She had to get all her medical records since her birth, pass medical tests, get many immunizations and boosters. She read testimonials and absorbed the concept and the details of the ultimate goals of the program launched in 1961 by seating President John F. Kennedy.Its purpose, as outlined by the Peace Corps Act: ""To promote world peace and friendship through a Peace Corps, which shall make available to interested countries and areas men and women of the United States qualified for service abroad and willing to serve, under conditions of hardship if necessary, to help the peoples of such countries and areas in meeting their needs for trained manpower"".Africa! Here She Comes!Finally, 11 months after applying, the long-awaited letter came, and in mid-May she learned with great joy that she will be sent to Africa! With a few tears she added that her new country was going to be Burkina Faso. Huh? Burkina Faso? Ok, I knew it was in West Africa, and that's just about it.We grabbed our world map, spread it on the floor and looked at the massive shape of the African continent. Right at the line where desert (white) meets jungle (green), there it was: the country formerly-known as Haute Volta (in my memory of geography) was just right there, landlocked between Niger, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Benin, Mali and Togo. No Ebola in the country.The first thing she found was how remote it was from any ocean. Being a Miami-born girl, she is a beach child, a surfer, a diver, a sun-worshiper. Well, she will now have to do without all those. But she wanted this, and was happy with it.I have a feeling she was chosen to go to Burkina Faso because she speaks fluent French and that is the official tongue of the country in West Africa. Her purpose there was stated as English teacher. She still did not know her exact location. Would she be in a big city, in a small village?Only 50 Pounds of Stuff Was Allowed to go With Her.The packing of the extra-large suitcase was an adventure in itself - with a long list of items required by the Peace Corps. Then June 3rd came and we said a long goodbye at the airport. Tears and smiles, hugs and kisses. I knew it was going to be hard, but the sheer span of the enterprise was still not completely grasped by either side.Three days in Philadelphia for gathering with the other 30 team members going to the same country; one bus trip to New York City; two airlines stops later (Brussels and Ouagadougou), she finally made it to her temporary new country.Africa, at Last!A couple of days in the capital, Ouagadougou (a name that always made me smile), where they were given cell phones and many instructions, the group of 30 were shipped to Leo, in the south of the country, for their three months of training. She met a few volunteers like her from Florida, she felt good about meeting them.The training is basically about how to live in Africa. It's got nothing to do with how to teach English to African children. They learned of their final destination. Only at that point did my daughter found out that she was assigned to a small village, Bagassi, in the west of the country. They each took lessons in the dialect of their village.She learned Djula. She's good at languages - she was the most fluent in French of the entire group for that session. She made instant friends; she's good at that too.Bagassi.Once in her village, where she is the only white person, she was given a house of bricks with walls of mud - no water, no electricity, no bathroom, but a hole in the ground far away in the back field. She sleeps on a cot under a mosquito net. There is no furniture, just a few tables, used as shelves, wardrobe, cupboard, pantry.The water she can drink comes in plastic pouches. She bought a solar panel to charge her phone. We speak every Sunday. The well for washing water is a mile away and she can fill two jerrycans each day. She got a puppy for company - and that puppy just had puppies, three of them, one got stolen - village people eat animals, there's no such thing as a pet.She teaches English to 200 students of all ages. I sent her many books on ESOL and other beginners' methods. She also started a girls club for the many (all) with questions about their bodies. She put a box for secret questions the girls can ask anonymously. It's always full.When we met in Paris in March, during her first 10-day break, we came upon a translated book by Jane Fonda about the female body, that's all we could find, so thank you for that Miss Fonda, your book is helping young girls in Africa.No Regrets.My daughter says sometimes it's difficult, sometimes it's heart-wrenching, but she loves it - she cannot wait for the other year and a half! She made many friends in the village, and she travels around the country a lot, to see other volunteers and attend Peace Corps meetings.During last October's elections, the worry was to see if the military coup that took place will allow Americans to stay in the country. It did. Now for this coming vote for president, also in October, the same question remains to be answered. She has had experiences she would never have obtained in the United States. She became even more resilient, resourceful, humble, compassionate and driven. I am very proud of her - she is changing lives, and changing the world at the same time.Follow her blog - when she travels to the capital and has access to the Internet, she updates it.Questions?

Inning by inning, it chronicles the opening game of the 1954 World Series, which the underdog New York Giants eventually won in four games over the Cleveland Indians. Hano takes readers into the stands in order to view the game from the perspective of the ordinary fans. He describes the most famous catch in baseball history -- Willie Mays' over-the-shoulder steal of Vic Wertz's fly ball to the Polo Grounds' deep center field that, had Mays not caught up to it, would have certainly been a triple (or even an inside-the-park homer). Hano also describes bleacher fans' thrill when Dusty Rhodes hit the game-winning pinch-hit home run in the 10th inning. A Day in the Bleachers is a baseball book but also a book about American culture at mid-century. We not only learn what occurred on the field but also about the observations and comments of the bleacher bums. Although A Day in the Bleachers is Hano's best-known work, he was for five decades one of America's preeminent sportswriters and one of our most under-appreciated chroniclers of the social and political events of the second half of the 20th century. Hano, now 93 years old, is a world-class writer, with 27 books (including biographies of Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, Roberto Clemente, Muhammad Ali, and Kareem Abdul Jabbar and a number of novels, several of them pulp fiction written under pseudonyms) and over 500 magazine articles, many of them for SPORT, Sports Illustrated, and TV Guide. He's also been a champion for social justice. He successfully battled racism in Orange County in the early 1960s and land developers in Laguna Beach and the Sequoia National Forest, and also helped stop dam building in parts of the Grand Canyon. In 1963, his peers voted him magazine sportswriter of the year and he also won the prestigious Sidney Hillman journalism prize for his article on the plight of California farm workers.Jon Leonoudakis, a brilliant documentary filmmaker, is making a film entitled Hano! A Century in the Bleachers that will debut this fall with screenings in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles and a promotional event in New York City. The DVD will be released on November. He just launched a crowdfunding campaign for the film and you can learn all about it and share your support at this link.   The original cover of the classic book. Leonoudakis and Hano. A more recent cover emphasizes Willie Mays' catch. Leonoudakis' subject is a gregarious, witty, colorful character with a remarkable memory for details and a lifetime of fascinating stories about his personal journey from a Depression-era boyhood to his encounters with Hall of Fame athletes, politicians, movie stars, writers, and everyday Americans. Hano was born in New York in 1922. His older brother taught him to read when he was three years old. He was briefly a Yankees fan, at age four, but when the Yankees lost the 1926 World Series he switched his allegiance to the New York Giants. His grandfather was a New York City cop and had free passes to the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium, which accounts for Hano's regular attendance at both ballparks. He began his writing career in 1930 on a mimeographed newspaper that he and his brother published when they were seven and ten years old.One of Hano's early heroes was Carl Hubbell, the Giants' ace pitcher who mortified batters with his dazzling screwball. As a pitcher on Long Island University's baseball team, Hano tried to emulate Hubbell. During an interview for the documentary, Hano told Leonoudakis, ""I want to throw a screwball and get it on film."" So, the day before his 93rd birthday, the two of them went over to Bluebird Park near Hano's home in Laguna Beach. Leonoudakis set up the cameras and went into the catcher's crouch as Hano took aim some 25 feet away. Hano, who is legally blind, tossed twelve screwballs, nine for strikes. If you don't believe it, you can see it on film as a clip from Leonoudakis' forthcoming documentary. Hano, who had been editor-in-chief of LIU's weekly newspaper, got his first newspaper job as a copy boy at the New York Daily News in 1941. The next year he enlisted in the Army. During artillery training at Fort Ord in 1943, he was accidently run over by a four-ton truck, crushing his right ankle and two vertebrae in his back. He not only survived, but recovered to serve with his unit in the Pacific until 1946. After the war, Hano pursued a career in book publishing in New York, becoming managing editor of Bantam Books, a paperback pioneer, in 1947 at age 25. He was fired in 1949 after trying to unionize his fellow employees. He moved to Lion Books, where he recruited authors and put out a number of anti-war novels. When he wrote A Day in the Bleachers, Hano was not yet a professional sportswriter. On the evening of September 28, 1954, he said to his wife, ""I think I'll go to the game tomorrow,"" referring to the first game of the World Series at the Polo Grounds. ""You'll never get in,"" she said.Hano stood in line for 40 minutes, talking with other fans, and finally paid $2.10 for a seat in the centerfield bleachers. Hano didn't go to the game intending to write a book. Like many fans, he kept score. But during the game, he also began scratching notes in the margins of the program as well as the newspaper he'd brought to the game. He recorded his conversations with fellow fans as well as what was happening on the field. After the game he took the subway home and later that evening began to write about his day. Less than four weeks later, he completed the manuscript. He found a publisher, who quickly brought out the book, which got glowing reviews, even though Hano was not part of the baseball writers' old-boy-network. The book was not a commercial success at first, but it established Hano's reputation as a remarkable writer. Over the years the book has gained a wider following and, equally important, has inspired many other writers to look at baseball and other sports from various idiosyncratic angles. By now, it is recognized as a sportswriting classic. Fortunately, the book is still in print.In 1955, Hano moved with his wife Bonnie and children to Laguna Beach, California, where they live today. He's made his living as a freelance writer and as an occasional writing teacher at the University of Southern California, Pitzer College, and the University of California, Irvine.After moving to Laguna Beach, he made friends with one of the area's few African-American families and learned that blacks were forced to drive out of town to get their haircuts because local barbers refused to cut their hair. When Hano reached out to the barbers, they told him they couldn't cut that kind of hair, and two of the barbers said that they were concerned they would lose white customers if they served blacks. Hano found a 1905 accommodation law on the books that stated if you're open for business, you were open to the whole public. Hano told the barbers about it, and they didn't care. In October of 1963, he took action, notifying the police and newspapers, telling them of his plans to desegregate the barbershops. Shortly thereafter, his son Stephen, who is white, entered a barber shop and was served. Midway through Steve's haircut, Hano arranged for Eli Pitts, who is black and a family member of Hano's friends, to enter and ask for a haircut. A barber asked Steve if he minded and young Hano said it was fine with him. The barber begrudgingly agreed to do so, and half-heartedly cut his hair. This event effectively cracked the Jim Crow practice in town, with one barber closing his shop and leaving town.In the early 70s, when Laguna Beach's political leaders wanted to change the town's zoning laws to allow developers to build high-rise hotels along the beach, Hano led a group to vote to impose height limits to three stories. It passed and the law is still going strong today.When Disney wanted to build a ski resort at Mineral King in the Sequoia National Forest, Hano wrote an article that pointed out they'd be chopping down 200 trees to support a parking lot for thousands of cars. It had an effect. William Douglas on the Supreme Court mentioned the piece in his decision. When President Lyndon Johnson wanted to build hydroelectric dams on the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, Hano rented a plane, flew through the canyon and the proposed site, and then wrote an article in the Los Angeles Times' West magazine objecting to the project . Stuart Udall, who was LBJ's secretary of the interior, told Hano: ""You pulled my chestnuts out of the fire when you wrote that piece,"" because he personally opposed the plan but had to publicly support it. In 1991, when Hano was 70 years old and his wife was 65, they both joined the Peace Corps in Costa Rica. One of their biggest accomplishments during their two years n that country, was helping to re-build a schoolhouse that had been broken down over 30 years from earthquakes and disrepair. An astonished friend, upon learning that Hano was joining the Peace Corps, asked him, ""Isn't there an age limit?"" Hano replied: ""Yes, you have to be at least 18.""Leonoudakis' film features interviews with a remarkable collection of Hano's colleagues, friends and others who hold him in high regard, including ballplayers Orlando Cepeda and Felipe Alou, New York Times columnist George Vecsey, sportwriters Al Silverman, Ray Robinson, John Schulian, and Ron Rapoport, artist Mark Ulriksen (who has illustrated 49 covers for The New Yorker), and Laguna Beach Council Member Toni Iseman (a big fan of Hano and his wife Bonnie, who rarely miss a monthly City Council meeting). As a sportswriter, Hano championed the efforts of Latino ballplayers to gain full acceptance in the major leagues in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He wrote profiles of Cepeda, Clemente, and other Latino stars for Sport magazine, describing the struggles they faced, the stereotypes they encountered among sportwriters, and the racism that persisted in major league baseball long after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947. Two of the film's most compelling interviews are with superstars Cepeda and Alou, who powerfully recall the racism and discrimination they experienced as young players on the San Francisco Giants from the late 50s to early 60s, particularly at the hands of manager Alvin Dark. Leonoudakis remembers reading Hano's biography of his hero, Willie Mays, when the future filmmaker was eight years old and growing up in San Francisco. Many years later, he devoured Hano's 1954 classic, A Day in the Bleachers. In 2010, he interviewed Hano for his documentary film, ""Not Exactly Cooperstown,"" about the Baseball Reliquary, a quirky people's hall of fame, and was not surprised to discover that Hano is a great storyteller and has a great memory. After he finished his next film project, ""The Day the World Series Stopped,"" about the 6.9 scale Bay Area earthquake that briefly halted the 1986 World Series, ""something tugged at my sleeve about Hano,"" Leonoudakis recalls. ""I did more research on him, and discovered the tremendous accomplishments in his career and personal life, and how they blended together as part of his efforts as a champion of social justice. Here was a guy who saw 70 games at the Polo Grounds in 1926 at the age of 4, saw Babe Ruth pitch his last game in 1933, then actually ran into the Babe and talked with him about it a few days later. He saw the 1934 NFL Championship game at the Polo Grounds, known as 'The Sneakers Game.' He won a contest and got a free trip to see the 1956 World Series, so he was there for Don Larsen's perfect game. He interviewed John F. Kennedy the day after he won the Democratic nomination in 1960. He went to the first Super Bowl. He wrote powerful articles about Cesar Chavez and California farm workers. What a life! Interviewing him on camera was like mining gold."" Anyone who donates will be in the film's credits if they do so by August 14.

Inning by inning, it chronicles the opening game of the 1954 World Series, which the underdog New York Giants eventually won in four games over the Cleveland Indians. Hano takes readers into the stands in order to view the game from the perspective of the ordinary fans. He describes the most famous catch in baseball history -- Willie Mays' over-the-shoulder steal of Vic Wertz's fly ball to the Polo Grounds' deep center field that, had Mays not caught up to it, would have certainly been a triple (or even an inside-the-park homer). Hano also describes bleacher fans' thrill when Dusty Rhodes hit the game-winning pinch-hit home run in the 10th inning. A Day in the Bleachers is a baseball book but also a book about American culture at mid-century. We not only learn what occurred on the field but also about the observations and comments of the bleacher bums. Although A Day in the Bleachers is Hano's best-known work, he was for five decades one of America's preeminent sportswriters and one of our most under-appreciated chroniclers of the social and political events of the second half of the 20th century. Hano, now 93 years old, is a world-class writer, with 27 books (including biographies of Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, Roberto Clemente, Muhammad Ali, and Kareem Abdul Jabbar and a number of novels, several of them pulp fiction written under pseudonyms) and over 500 magazine articles, many of them for SPORT, Sports Illustrated, and TV Guide. He's also been a champion for social justice. He successfully battled racism in Orange County in the early 1960s and land developers in Laguna Beach and the Sequoia National Forest, and also helped stop dam building in parts of the Grand Canyon. In 1963, his peers voted him magazine sportswriter of the year and he also won the prestigious Sidney Hillman journalism prize for his article on the plight of California farm workers.Jon Leonoudakis, a brilliant documentary filmmaker, is making a film entitled Hano! A Century in the Bleachers that will debut this fall with screenings in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles and a promotional event in New York City. The DVD will be released on November. He just launched a crowdfunding campaign for the film and you can learn all about it and share your support at this link.   The original cover of the classic book. Leonoudakis and Hano. A more recent cover emphasizes Willie Mays' catch. Leonoudakis' subject is a gregarious, witty, colorful character with a remarkable memory for details and a lifetime of fascinating stories about his personal journey from a Depression-era boyhood to his encounters with Hall of Fame athletes, politicians, movie stars, writers, and everyday Americans. Hano was born in New York in 1922. His older brother taught him to read when he was three years old. He was briefly a Yankees fan, at age four, but when the Yankees lost the 1926 World Series he switched his allegiance to the New York Giants. His grandfather was a New York City cop and had free passes to the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium, which accounts for Hano's regular attendance at both ballparks. He began his writing career in 1930 on a mimeographed newspaper that he and his brother published when they were seven and ten years old.One of Hano's early heroes was Carl Hubbell, the Giants' ace pitcher who mortified batters with his dazzling screwball. As a pitcher on Long Island University's baseball team, Hano tried to emulate Hubbell. During an interview for the documentary, Hano told Leonoudakis, ""I want to throw a screwball and get it on film."" So, the day before his 93rd birthday, the two of them went over to Bluebird Park near Hano's home in Laguna Beach. Leonoudakis set up the cameras and went into the catcher's crouch as Hano took aim some 25 feet away. Hano, who is legally blind, tossed twelve screwballs, nine for strikes. If you don't believe it, you can see it on film as a clip from Leonoudakis' forthcoming documentary. Hano, who had been editor-in-chief of LIU's weekly newspaper, got his first newspaper job as a copy boy at the New York Daily News in 1941. The next year he enlisted in the Army. During artillery training at Fort Ord in 1943, he was accidently run over by a four-ton truck, crushing his right ankle and two vertebrae in his back. He not only survived, but recovered to serve with his unit in the Pacific until 1946. After the war, Hano pursued a career in book publishing in New York, becoming managing editor of Bantam Books, a paperback pioneer, in 1947 at age 25. He was fired in 1949 after trying to unionize his fellow employees. He moved to Lion Books, where he recruited authors and put out a number of anti-war novels. When he wrote A Day in the Bleachers, Hano was not yet a professional sportswriter. On the evening of September 28, 1954, he said to his wife, ""I think I'll go to the game tomorrow,"" referring to the first game of the World Series at the Polo Grounds. ""You'll never get in,"" she said.Hano stood in line for 40 minutes, talking with other fans, and finally paid $2.10 for a seat in the centerfield bleachers. Hano didn't go to the game intending to write a book. Like many fans, he kept score. But during the game, he also began scratching notes in the margins of the program as well as the newspaper he'd brought to the game. He recorded his conversations with fellow fans as well as what was happening on the field. After the game he took the subway home and later that evening began to write about his day. Less than four weeks later, he completed the manuscript. He found a publisher, who quickly brought out the book, which got glowing reviews, even though Hano was not part of the baseball writers' old-boy-network. The book was not a commercial success at first, but it established Hano's reputation as a remarkable writer. Over the years the book has gained a wider following and, equally important, has inspired many other writers to look at baseball and other sports from various idiosyncratic angles. By now, it is recognized as a sportswriting classic. Fortunately, the book is still in print.In 1955, Hano moved with his wife Bonnie and children to Laguna Beach, California, where they live today. He's made his living as a freelance writer and as an occasional writing teacher at the University of Southern California, Pitzer College, and the University of California, Irvine.After moving to Laguna Beach, he made friends with one of the area's few African-American families and learned that blacks were forced to drive out of town to get their haircuts because local barbers refused to cut their hair. When Hano reached out to the barbers, they told him they couldn't cut that kind of hair, and two of the barbers said that they were concerned they would lose white customers if they served blacks. Hano found a 1905 accommodation law on the books that stated if you're open for business, you were open to the whole public. Hano told the barbers about it, and they didn't care. In October of 1963, he took action, notifying the police and newspapers, telling them of his plans to desegregate the barbershops. Shortly thereafter, his son Stephen, who is white, entered a barber shop and was served. Midway through Steve's haircut, Hano arranged for Eli Pitts, who is black and a family member of Hano's friends, to enter and ask for a haircut. A barber asked Steve if he minded and young Hano said it was fine with him. The barber begrudgingly agreed to do so, and half-heartedly cut his hair. This event effectively cracked the Jim Crow practice in town, with one barber closing his shop and leaving town.In the early 70s, when Laguna Beach's political leaders wanted to change the town's zoning laws to allow developers to build high-rise hotels along the beach, Hano led a group to vote to impose height limits to three stories. It passed and the law is still going strong today.When Disney wanted to build a ski resort at Mineral King in the Sequoia National Forest, Hano wrote an article that pointed out they'd be chopping down 200 trees to support a parking lot for thousands of cars. It had an effect. William Douglas on the Supreme Court mentioned the piece in his decision. When President Lyndon Johnson wanted to build hydroelectric dams on the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, Hano rented a plane, flew through the canyon and the proposed site, and then wrote an article in the Los Angeles Times' West magazine objecting to the project . Stuart Udall, who was LBJ's secretary of the interior, told Hano: ""You pulled my chestnuts out of the fire when you wrote that piece,"" because he personally opposed the plan but had to publicly support it. In 1991, when Hano was 70 years old and his wife was 65, they both joined the Peace Corps in Costa Rica. One of their biggest accomplishments during their two years n that country, was helping to re-build a schoolhouse that had been broken down over 30 years from earthquakes and disrepair. An astonished friend, upon learning that Hano was joining the Peace Corps, asked him, ""Isn't there an age limit?"" Hano replied: ""Yes, you have to be at least 18.""Leonoudakis' film features interviews with a remarkable collection of Hano's colleagues, friends and others who hold him in high regard, including ballplayers Orlando Cepeda and Felipe Alou, New York Times columnist George Vecsey, sportwriters Al Silverman, Ray Robinson, John Schulian, and Ron Rapoport, artist Mark Ulriksen (who has illustrated 49 covers for The New Yorker), and Laguna Beach Council Member Toni Iseman (a big fan of Hano and his wife Bonnie, who rarely miss a monthly City Council meeting).

John McCain (R-Ariz.) during a news conference Saturday -- but things got heated when he started bickering with reporters. The real estate mogul-turned-presidential-candidate took questions from reporters following his comments at the Family Leadership Summit in which he questioned whether Arizona Sen. John McCain (R) was a war hero. In a fiery exchange with reporters, Trump raised his voice, often interrupting before a full question was asked. At one point, he even yelled at one journalist, telling him to “go back to being a pundit.” ""If a person is captured, they're a hero as far as I'm concerned,"" Trump said. ""But you have to do other things also. I don't like the job John McCain is doing in the Senate. He's not taking care of our veterans.”Trump went back and forth with reporters, trying to clarify his statements, but the businessman kept giving different answers as if there was some confusion.“I like the people who don’t get captured and you have many people who didn’t get captured, I respect them greatly,” he said.When asked about his multiple student deferments and a medical deferment, which allowed him to avoid service, Trump said “millions of other people” took the same option.“I was going to college and got student deferments,” Trump said to a swarm of media. “It’s a long time ago, student deferments and ultimately a medical deferment because of my feet. I had a bone spur.”Trump even went on to say he “wasn’t a big fan” of the Vietnam War and had many friends that served and many that also had student deferments.“I wasn’t a protester, but the Vietnam war was a disaster for our country. What did we get out of the war other than death,” Trump said.When asked if he would apologize to the Arizona senator, Trump refused."

Below is the Pit River, and in the distance, Highway 395.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a9917d1700002200bafb09.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In the foggy early morning hours of Wednesday, July 8, special agents from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Drug Enforcement Administration and state and local law enforcement descended on the Pit River Tribe’s XL Ranch and the Alturas Indian Rancheria in northeastern California, seizing 12,000 marijuana plants and 100 pounds of processed pot from the two large-scale growing facilities.The Alturas Indian Rancheria and the XL Ranch are located on opposite sides of the town of Alturas, California. The tribes that operate them, Alturas and Pit River, are separate federally recognized tribes, but are descended from the same 11 bands of Achumawi- and Atsugewi-speaking peoples that called the region home long before the arrival of white settlers.The U.S. Attorney’s Office has not yet filed any charges against the tribes or individuals related to the raid. The office declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.Pit River tribal leaders have declared the raid a violation of their sovereign rights. ""We are very disappointed with the decision of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as the lead federal agency, to descend on sovereign land with an army of nearly fifty law enforcement officers,"" Pit River Tribal Chairman Mickey Gemmill Jr. said in a press release. ""That the BIA would take such a disrespectful approach to an Indian tribe on its own land is a serious assault to the Tribe’s right to self-governance.""The raid has reignited intense battles over sovereign rights on tribal land, particularly when it comes to the legalization of marijuana. But it’s also a story of two tribes’ conflicted internal politics when it comes to grow operations on tribal land, and of the perilous path faced by tribes looking to legalize pot. ***Defiance grows along the banks of the Pit River. It is indigenous to the 11 autonomous bands of the Pit River Tribe. The 1970 film The Dispossessed detailed the Pit River peoples’ struggle to reclaim their land from the United States, California and big business. Another film, Forty-Seven Cents, won an Emmy in 1973 for its depiction of the tribe’s refusal to accept the U.S. government’s paltry offer of 47 cents an acre to each tribal member as repayment for lands stolen in 1853.Inspired by the iconic occupation of Alcatraz that thrust the political demands of Native Americans into the mainstream, about 100 men, women and children from Pit River took over an area of forest land in a region known as the Four Corners in the summer of 1970, in protest of the Forest Service and Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s ownership of their stolen ancestral land. The occupiers erected a Quonset hut, a type of prefabricated military-surplus structure, and told authorities they’d “have to be killed” in order for law enforcement to tear it down and evict them.On Oct. 27, 1970, 52 armed police officers and more than 50 Forest Service personnel carrying crowbars came to arrest the protesters in an effort to “break the back” of the tribe’s effort to reclaim their lands. A melee ensued, with Pit River people fighting back with tree limbs, two-by-fours and their bare fists. Dozens of Indians were arrested, but only one was ultimately sentenced. Six years later, Pit River won federal recognition of their sovereign rights.That fighting spirit has endured over the decades at Pit River. More recently, the tribe has organized to protect their sacred Medicine Lake from geothermal developers. And in the tradition of leaders past, the current tribal chairman Gemmill’s email address includes the unofficial Pit River maxim: “resistanceresistance.” When it comes to marijuana, the tribe has upheld this tradition of resistance.The Justice Department released a memo in October 2014 laying out new guidelines about the proper regulatory steps tribes must take if they want to legalize marijuana. Soon after, Pit River and dozens of other tribes moved to legalize the cultivation of medical marijuana on tribal land.But although the memo provided guidance to tribes seeking to legalize marijuana, it also clearly stated that ""nothing herein precludes investigation or prosecution.""The Pit River told authorities they were legalizing marijuana and setting up a farm. At times, they were even cavalier: They set-up the XL Ranch, with 40 brand new greenhouses and the capacity to grow up to 60,000 plants, right alongside Highway 395, a main thoroughfare through town.""We have been transparent in our conversations with the federal government and made no secret of our intent to exercise our sovereignty in the manner we believe appropriate,"" Gemmill said in a statement after the raid. ""We consulted with the U.S. Attorney’s Office prior to implementing our Ordinance and continued to consult with that office and other government officials throughout its implementation.""Gemmill did not respond to The Huffington Post’s requests for comment beyond the press release.But others within the tribe thought the council was going too far in calling attention to the operations. ""From tribal council it was this arrogance, really thumbing their nose to the Modoc County Sheriff,"" a source inside the Pit River government, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, told The Huffington Post. ""They could have put it on the other side of the hill and nobody would have seen it, but they wanted it out in the open. They wanted people to know what they were doing.""***While openness of the operations may have made the farms a target for the feds, underlying tribal politics may have been their real downfall.Among the parties implicated in the search warrant for the raid is Phillip Del Rosa, a member of the Alturas Indian Rancheria. The Alturas is a tiny tribe with only two undisputed members: Phillip and his sister Wendy, descendants of the 40 landless Indians that the Office of Indian Affairs originally placed onto the Alturas Rancheria in 1924.Wendy is listed as a primary informant in the search warrant for last Wednesday’s raid, which is just the latest installment in an ongoing Del Rosa family drama.Since 2008, the siblings have been locked in an internal struggle over the tribe and its business ventures, including the Desert Rose Casino, a second casino and failed attempts at cigarette manufacturing. In addition, Wendy has disputed Phillip’s claim to the chairmanship of the Alturas Rancheria. In October of 2013, Wendy accused Phillip of embezzlement and revoked his voting rights. The drama has continued to play out in state and federal courts over the last few years, costing the tiny tribe over $2 million in legal fees, prompting the BIA to withhold $500,000 in federal funding, and leading the California Gambling Control Commission to freeze $550,118 in revenue from the casino.But Phillip Del Rosa doesn’t appear to be the mastermind behind the marijuana operations. A source within the Pit River government told The Huffington Post it was Indian law attorney John Peebles of the firm Frederick, Peebles & Morgan who brokered the Alturas and Pit River deals, and Canadian investor Jerry Montour, CEO of tobacco corporation Grand River Enterprises, who financed the grow operations. Peebles introduced both Phillip Del Rosa and Pit River representatives to Montour, the source said, facilitating the deal that got both grow operations underway.Both Peebles and Montour are listed as people of interest in the search warrant for the raid, and the warrant also cites Wendy and several confidential informants as pointing to Peebles and Montour as the central players in both grow operations. Neither Peebles nor Montour responded to requests for comment for this story.Montour, who is a Mohawk from the Canadian province of Ontario, has been convicted of multiple crimes in Canada, including conspiracy to import marijuana in 1988. And Peebles’ other business dealings include helping online payday lenders avoid state regulations by seeking shelter under the sovereign jurisdictions of Indian reservations (a subject The Huffington Post covered previously).According to an agenda from a Feb. 24 meeting of the Pit River tribal council obtained by The Huffington Post, eight members of the Pit River tribal council approved an ordinance authorizing the XL Ranch operation. Two members abstained, while Gwen Wolfin, representative of the Atsugewi band, voted against it. The ordinance was ambiguously called a “Non-Profit Association Ordinance,” which the decision’s critics allege was an attempt to cover the council’s tracks.  But tribal members from both Pit River and the Alturas Rancheria now dispute whether those growing facilities received members' approval. In the search warrant for the raid, Wendy Del Rosa alleges that the actions of Phillip Del Rosa and his business partners do not represent the Alturas Rancheria. She claims the operation was opposed by the tribe (or perhaps more accurately, by her and her adopted allies within the tribe), and is quoted as asking authorities to ""take all appropriate law enforcement action to close this illegal drug operation and bring those responsible to justice.""A press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office states that the two farms “appear to have been operating in conjunction with each other,” although Pit River leaders dispute this claim. Despite evidence indicating that the same attorney and investor, Peebles and Montour, orchestrated and financed both grow operations, Pit River claimed in a press release that it has ""no affiliation with the Alturas Indian Rancheria and is not cooperating with any marijuana cultivation being conducted on the 20 acre Alturas Rancheria.""***In the months since the ordinance authorizing the marijuana operation was approved, Pit River members have raised concerns about policing, environmental issues and labor issues at the XL Ranch. ""At individual band meetings, members expressed to their council people that they had concerns about the venture,"" the Pit River government source told The Huffington Post.""Tribal members who were coming in and out were being profiled, followed and stopped by police,"" said the source. ""The tribe held a 'know your rights' training at one point to inform tribal members about what to say and what not to say to the cops.""Members also raised concerns about the environmental impact of the operations, which were located near the headwaters of the Pit River -- particularly in light of the unprecedented California drought. ""When you are talking about 50,000 plants and eight to 10 gallons of water per day per plant, that’s just a lot of water,"" the source said.They also raised concerns about labor conditions at the sites, especially after Don Rouse, a 74-year-old member of the Hoopa tribe employed on the ranch, died in early June. Some employees on the ranch said they thought working conditions contributed to his death.""It was really hot, people didn’t have enough water, there was no adequate restrooms or camping, and no overtime, so they were basically working however long they could stand it,"" said the Pit River government source.Gerri McGarva, who worked at the XL Ranch facility and rode to work with Rouse every morning disputed claims about mistreatment. “They let Don have pretty decent jobs for his age,” said McGarva. “If it was so bad, why are his grandkids still out their working? … It was a very good place to work and them guys treated you really good.”Rouse’s family did not respond to a request for comment on his death.A job posting on the Pit River website advertises a temporary $15-per-hour job through Pomari-Awte at the XL Ranch. The listing leaves the number of hours open-ended, and does not mention any overtime compensation.Backlash also seems to be growing among Pit River members who are frustrated with the way tribal council has responded to the raid. “Our people in power that we have elected dropped the ball on us,” said Yogi McGarva, a Pit River tribal member, brother to Gerri and also an employee at the XL Ranch.The memory of the 1970 Four Corners occupation weighs heavily on his mind, and Yogi is concerned that the tribal council won’t stand up to the federal government for the Pit River peoples’ hard-won rights. “They’re gonna roll over and play dead, like they always do, and get their checks and go on,” he said.Shortly after the raid, staff of the Pit River Tribe received a directive from tribal council not to speak to the media, according to the government source. Workers at the XL Ranch received a similar gag order, several confirmed to The Huffington Post. And the tribal council passed a motion on July 14 that would suspend without pay any staff or workers who comment on the raid or the marijuana operation to the media or on social media.***It rained hard on the Tuesday night before the raid, and law enforcement rolled in with the fog on Wednesday morning. ""They just keep flying around the rez ????"" one tribal member posted on Facebook in alarm and confusion at 6:42 that morning.The raid had clearly been planned some time in advance. The search warrant indicates that federal agents began surveilling the sites in April. “I had been telling people for days that we were being watched by somebody up there,” said the worker, referring to the hill above the XL Ranch.Law enforcement, dressed in camouflage and wielding Tasers and assault rifles, descended on the ranch at around 7 a.m., according to accounts from the scene. The Pit River Tribe’s press release described the police force that entered tribal land as an ""army."" One tribal member who worked at the facility and wished to remain anonymous because employees aren’t authorized to talk to the press said ""it felt like the cavalry coming in.""""You could see them coming off the hill, all the pickups and everything,” said Gerri McGarva, who was working at the facility that morning. “They said, ‘This is a raid, put your hands up’ before anybody stepped out of the car.”""At one time I counted 55 law enforcement vehicles with three or four people in each vehicle,"" said her brother Yogi. ""There was 100 to 150 officers down roaming around in there.""Witnesses allege that workers were brutalized by the police, and Pit River tribal members responded with indignation about what they perceived to be a violent invasion of sovereign Indian land.""They told us to walk through the gates with our arms up, or they would shoot and kill us,"" said Gerri, who said four people were initially arrested but that the authorities ""got a bunch more later.""Gerri alleges that at least one tribal member was hit with a Taser, an account another tribal member repeated on Facebook. The worker who wished to remain anonymous claims to have witnessed two officers beating another worker. The U.S. Attorney’s Office, DEA and Modoc County Sheriff declined to comment on the allegations. Bureau of Indian Affairs spokeswoman Nedra Darling said the agency “is not aware of any instance of inappropriate conduct by law enforcement during the execution of the judicially authorized search warrants.” But, because of “the ongoing nature of the investigation, we are unable to provide further comment,” she said.In a press release last Friday, Gemmill expressed outrage over the treatment of tribal members. ""This action was especially appalling given that some tribal members were subjected to excessive police force, severely injured and arrested during the search.""Peebles and Montour, the business partners who were identified as persons of interest in the ongoing investigation into the financing and management of the operation, were not at the scene and were not among the workers allegedly hit with Tasers and arrested by the police. According to tribal members, they haven’t been seen since the raid.“Them lawyers [from Frederick, Peebles & Morgan] should be right here in Alturas defending us in front of the courthouse,” said Yogi.In the aftermath, one tribal member beseeched the community to rally at the Modoc County Sheriff’s Department in support of brutalized and arrested workers, calling on Facebook for ""support of our Native Brother an Sisters for standing for our rights ON OUR OWN LAND. MODOC COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT will be held accountable for their excess force an use of Taser Guns,"" and using the hashtag #OurLandTakeAStand. ***The high-drama raid might just be the result of a big misunderstanding about the legal status of marijuana operations on tribal land. Following the Justice Department’s memo from October, many tribes rushed to legalize marijuana.""When this memo appeared, everyone was like, ‘Marijuana is legal! Marijuana is legal in Indian Country!"" said Lael Echo-Hawk, an attorney at Garvey Schubert Barer and member of the National Indian Cannabis Coalition. ""It absolutely is not.""""What that memo said was that tribes need to go talk with the U.S. District Attorney, and the District Attorney can decide whether or not to use his prosecutorial discretion and not prosecute tribes and entrepreneurs as long as they are operating under a robust regulatory scheme, which is what the Department of Justice is requiring all the states to do that are regulating marijuana,"" explains Echo-Hawk.Legalizing marijuana, which remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance under federal law, requires robust regulations and painstaking care in legal, financial and environmental planning -- details that Alturas and Pit River hop-scotched over in their rush to cash in on the industry.""[Alturas and Pit River] talked to the U.S. District Attorney, but they didn’t have any non-prosecution agreements,"" said Echo-Hawk. ""They didn’t have any agreements worked out with the sheriff.""There are many considerations tribes must weigh before jumping into the marijuana industry. Although tribes have jurisdiction over their own members on their land, non-tribal members are still subject to state laws. The state also maintains jurisdiction of roads on the reservation -- and, of course, of roads off the reservation, which tribes presumably will use to ship marijuana and production implements.Water is another issue, as the Bureau of Reclamation has said it will not provide water to legalized marijuana growers, a decision that would extend to tribes.Echo-Hawk also says tribes could be jeopardizing essential federal funding, and must procure statements from federal departments promising they won’t cut funding if tribes pursue legalization.For these reasons and others, tribes have generally followed the states they are located within rather than preceding them on the path to legalization. A recent exception to this rule, the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe, has faced opposition from the state of South Dakota, where marijuana is not legal.Despite these obstacles, Echo-Hawk believes the medicinal and economic benefits of marijuana and hemp make pursuing legalization in Indian Country a worthwhile endeavor. ""It has to be done right,"" she said. ""Every single ‘i’ has to be dotted, every ‘t’ crossed. It’s going to take time to lay the groundwork and put it all in place, and you can’t jump the gun.""But Pit River and Alturas appear to have done just that.Pit River officials may now be backtracking and pointing fingers about who’s to blame for the raid, but the tribe has remained assertive about what it views to be its sovereign right to cultivate marijuana. It’s the latest act of defiance in a place where defiance is indigenous.But this time around, the industry that brought law enforcement into Pit River land wasn’t gold, like it was in the 1800s, or natural resources and energy, like it was in the 1970s. After generations of attempts to “civilize” Indians by teaching them to cultivate the land and start their own businesses, it was a farm that brought in the feds again."

Special Agent Charles Turner took this surveillance photo on June 19, 2015.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a993501700002200bafb0a.png?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In the foggy early morning hours of Wednesday, July 8, special agents from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Drug Enforcement Administration and state and local law enforcement descended on the Pit River Tribe’s XL Ranch and the Alturas Indian Rancheria in northeastern California, seizing 12,000 marijuana plants and 100 pounds of processed pot from the two large-scale growing facilities.The Alturas Indian Rancheria and the XL Ranch are located on opposite sides of the town of Alturas, California. The tribes that operate them, Alturas and Pit River, are separate federally recognized tribes, but are descended from the same 11 bands of Achumawi- and Atsugewi-speaking peoples that called the region home long before the arrival of white settlers.The U.S. Attorney’s Office has not yet filed any charges against the tribes or individuals related to the raid. The office declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.Pit River tribal leaders have declared the raid a violation of their sovereign rights. ""We are very disappointed with the decision of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as the lead federal agency, to descend on sovereign land with an army of nearly fifty law enforcement officers,"" Pit River Tribal Chairman Mickey Gemmill Jr. said in a press release. ""That the BIA would take such a disrespectful approach to an Indian tribe on its own land is a serious assault to the Tribe’s right to self-governance.""The raid has reignited intense battles over sovereign rights on tribal land, particularly when it comes to the legalization of marijuana. But it’s also a story of two tribes’ conflicted internal politics when it comes to grow operations on tribal land, and of the perilous path faced by tribes looking to legalize pot. ***Defiance grows along the banks of the Pit River. It is indigenous to the 11 autonomous bands of the Pit River Tribe. The 1970 film The Dispossessed detailed the Pit River peoples’ struggle to reclaim their land from the United States, California and big business. Another film, Forty-Seven Cents, won an Emmy in 1973 for its depiction of the tribe’s refusal to accept the U.S. government’s paltry offer of 47 cents an acre to each tribal member as repayment for lands stolen in 1853.Inspired by the iconic occupation of Alcatraz that thrust the political demands of Native Americans into the mainstream, about 100 men, women and children from Pit River took over an area of forest land in a region known as the Four Corners in the summer of 1970, in protest of the Forest Service and Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s ownership of their stolen ancestral land. The occupiers erected a Quonset hut, a type of prefabricated military-surplus structure, and told authorities they’d “have to be killed” in order for law enforcement to tear it down and evict them.On Oct. 27, 1970, 52 armed police officers and more than 50 Forest Service personnel carrying crowbars came to arrest the protesters in an effort to “break the back” of the tribe’s effort to reclaim their lands. A melee ensued, with Pit River people fighting back with tree limbs, two-by-fours and their bare fists. Dozens of Indians were arrested, but only one was ultimately sentenced. Six years later, Pit River won federal recognition of their sovereign rights.That fighting spirit has endured over the decades at Pit River. More recently, the tribe has organized to protect their sacred Medicine Lake from geothermal developers. And in the tradition of leaders past, the current tribal chairman Gemmill’s email address includes the unofficial Pit River maxim: “resistanceresistance.” When it comes to marijuana, the tribe has upheld this tradition of resistance.The Justice Department released a memo in October 2014 laying out new guidelines about the proper regulatory steps tribes must take if they want to legalize marijuana. Soon after, Pit River and dozens of other tribes moved to legalize the cultivation of medical marijuana on tribal land.But although the memo provided guidance to tribes seeking to legalize marijuana, it also clearly stated that ""nothing herein precludes investigation or prosecution.""The Pit River told authorities they were legalizing marijuana and setting up a farm. At times, they were even cavalier: They set-up the XL Ranch, with 40 brand new greenhouses and the capacity to grow up to 60,000 plants, right alongside Highway 395, a main thoroughfare through town.""We have been transparent in our conversations with the federal government and made no secret of our intent to exercise our sovereignty in the manner we believe appropriate,"" Gemmill said in a statement after the raid. ""We consulted with the U.S. Attorney’s Office prior to implementing our Ordinance and continued to consult with that office and other government officials throughout its implementation.""Gemmill did not respond to The Huffington Post’s requests for comment beyond the press release.But others within the tribe thought the council was going too far in calling attention to the operations. ""From tribal council it was this arrogance, really thumbing their nose to the Modoc County Sheriff,"" a source inside the Pit River government, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, told The Huffington Post. ""They could have put it on the other side of the hill and nobody would have seen it, but they wanted it out in the open. They wanted people to know what they were doing.""***While openness of the operations may have made the farms a target for the feds, underlying tribal politics may have been their real downfall.Among the parties implicated in the search warrant for the raid is Phillip Del Rosa, a member of the Alturas Indian Rancheria. The Alturas is a tiny tribe with only two undisputed members: Phillip and his sister Wendy, descendants of the 40 landless Indians that the Office of Indian Affairs originally placed onto the Alturas Rancheria in 1924.Wendy is listed as a primary informant in the search warrant for last Wednesday’s raid, which is just the latest installment in an ongoing Del Rosa family drama.Since 2008, the siblings have been locked in an internal struggle over the tribe and its business ventures, including the Desert Rose Casino, a second casino and failed attempts at cigarette manufacturing. In addition, Wendy has disputed Phillip’s claim to the chairmanship of the Alturas Rancheria. In October of 2013, Wendy accused Phillip of embezzlement and revoked his voting rights. The drama has continued to play out in state and federal courts over the last few years, costing the tiny tribe over $2 million in legal fees, prompting the BIA to withhold $500,000 in federal funding, and leading the California Gambling Control Commission to freeze $550,118 in revenue from the casino.But Phillip Del Rosa doesn’t appear to be the mastermind behind the marijuana operations. A source within the Pit River government told The Huffington Post it was Indian law attorney John Peebles of the firm Frederick, Peebles & Morgan who brokered the Alturas and Pit River deals, and Canadian investor Jerry Montour, CEO of tobacco corporation Grand River Enterprises, who financed the grow operations. Peebles introduced both Phillip Del Rosa and Pit River representatives to Montour, the source said, facilitating the deal that got both grow operations underway.Both Peebles and Montour are listed as people of interest in the search warrant for the raid, and the warrant also cites Wendy and several confidential informants as pointing to Peebles and Montour as the central players in both grow operations. Neither Peebles nor Montour responded to requests for comment for this story.Montour, who is a Mohawk from the Canadian province of Ontario, has been convicted of multiple crimes in Canada, including conspiracy to import marijuana in 1988. And Peebles’ other business dealings include helping online payday lenders avoid state regulations by seeking shelter under the sovereign jurisdictions of Indian reservations (a subject The Huffington Post covered previously).According to an agenda from a Feb. 24 meeting of the Pit River tribal council obtained by The Huffington Post, eight members of the Pit River tribal council approved an ordinance authorizing the XL Ranch operation. Two members abstained, while Gwen Wolfin, representative of the Atsugewi band, voted against it. The ordinance was ambiguously called a “Non-Profit Association Ordinance,” which the decision’s critics allege was an attempt to cover the council’s tracks.  But tribal members from both Pit River and the Alturas Rancheria now dispute whether those growing facilities received members' approval. In the search warrant for the raid, Wendy Del Rosa alleges that the actions of Phillip Del Rosa and his business partners do not represent the Alturas Rancheria. She claims the operation was opposed by the tribe (or perhaps more accurately, by her and her adopted allies within the tribe), and is quoted as asking authorities to ""take all appropriate law enforcement action to close this illegal drug operation and bring those responsible to justice.""A press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office states that the two farms “appear to have been operating in conjunction with each other,” although Pit River leaders dispute this claim. Despite evidence indicating that the same attorney and investor, Peebles and Montour, orchestrated and financed both grow operations, Pit River claimed in a press release that it has ""no affiliation with the Alturas Indian Rancheria and is not cooperating with any marijuana cultivation being conducted on the 20 acre Alturas Rancheria.""***In the months since the ordinance authorizing the marijuana operation was approved, Pit River members have raised concerns about policing, environmental issues and labor issues at the XL Ranch. ""At individual band meetings, members expressed to their council people that they had concerns about the venture,"" the Pit River government source told The Huffington Post.""Tribal members who were coming in and out were being profiled, followed and stopped by police,"" said the source. ""The tribe held a 'know your rights' training at one point to inform tribal members about what to say and what not to say to the cops.""Members also raised concerns about the environmental impact of the operations, which were located near the headwaters of the Pit River -- particularly in light of the unprecedented California drought. ""When you are talking about 50,000 plants and eight to 10 gallons of water per day per plant, that’s just a lot of water,"" the source said.They also raised concerns about labor conditions at the sites, especially after Don Rouse, a 74-year-old member of the Hoopa tribe employed on the ranch, died in early June. Some employees on the ranch said they thought working conditions contributed to his death.""It was really hot, people didn’t have enough water, there was no adequate restrooms or camping, and no overtime, so they were basically working however long they could stand it,"" said the Pit River government source.Gerri McGarva, who worked at the XL Ranch facility and rode to work with Rouse every morning disputed claims about mistreatment. “They let Don have pretty decent jobs for his age,” said McGarva. “If it was so bad, why are his grandkids still out their working? … It was a very good place to work and them guys treated you really good.”Rouse’s family did not respond to a request for comment on his death.A job posting on the Pit River website advertises a temporary $15-per-hour job through Pomari-Awte at the XL Ranch. The listing leaves the number of hours open-ended, and does not mention any overtime compensation.Backlash also seems to be growing among Pit River members who are frustrated with the way tribal council has responded to the raid. “Our people in power that we have elected dropped the ball on us,” said Yogi McGarva, a Pit River tribal member, brother to Gerri and also an employee at the XL Ranch.The memory of the 1970 Four Corners occupation weighs heavily on his mind, and Yogi is concerned that the tribal council won’t stand up to the federal government for the Pit River peoples’ hard-won rights. “They’re gonna roll over and play dead, like they always do, and get their checks and go on,” he said.Shortly after the raid, staff of the Pit River Tribe received a directive from tribal council not to speak to the media, according to the government source. Workers at the XL Ranch received a similar gag order, several confirmed to The Huffington Post. And the tribal council passed a motion on July 14 that would suspend without pay any staff or workers who comment on the raid or the marijuana operation to the media or on social media.***It rained hard on the Tuesday night before the raid, and law enforcement rolled in with the fog on Wednesday morning. ""They just keep flying around the rez ????"" one tribal member posted on Facebook in alarm and confusion at 6:42 that morning.The raid had clearly been planned some time in advance. The search warrant indicates that federal agents began surveilling the sites in April. “I had been telling people for days that we were being watched by somebody up there,” said the worker, referring to the hill above the XL Ranch.Law enforcement, dressed in camouflage and wielding Tasers and assault rifles, descended on the ranch at around 7 a.m., according to accounts from the scene. The Pit River Tribe’s press release described the police force that entered tribal land as an ""army."" One tribal member who worked at the facility and wished to remain anonymous because employees aren’t authorized to talk to the press said ""it felt like the cavalry coming in.""""You could see them coming off the hill, all the pickups and everything,” said Gerri McGarva, who was working at the facility that morning. “They said, ‘This is a raid, put your hands up’ before anybody stepped out of the car.”""At one time I counted 55 law enforcement vehicles with three or four people in each vehicle,"" said her brother Yogi. ""There was 100 to 150 officers down roaming around in there.""Witnesses allege that workers were brutalized by the police, and Pit River tribal members responded with indignation about what they perceived to be a violent invasion of sovereign Indian land.""They told us to walk through the gates with our arms up, or they would shoot and kill us,"" said Gerri, who said four people were initially arrested but that the authorities ""got a bunch more later.""Gerri alleges that at least one tribal member was hit with a Taser, an account another tribal member repeated on Facebook. The worker who wished to remain anonymous claims to have witnessed two officers beating another worker. The U.S. Attorney’s Office, DEA and Modoc County Sheriff declined to comment on the allegations. Bureau of Indian Affairs spokeswoman Nedra Darling said the agency “is not aware of any instance of inappropriate conduct by law enforcement during the execution of the judicially authorized search warrants.” But, because of “the ongoing nature of the investigation, we are unable to provide further comment,” she said.In a press release last Friday, Gemmill expressed outrage over the treatment of tribal members.

There are many vague terms in the text,” said newly-appointed Labor Minister George Katrougalos.He said the government, elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, would fight for an agreement that was “socially just” and dismissed suggestions that it would have to take on the powerful labor unions and risk street protests.“The Left is with demonstrations. The Left wants the people on the streets,” he said.TOUGH BAILOUT TERMSThe deal, approved with the support of opposition parties on Thursday after 39 Syriza rebels withheld their backing, agrees a painful mix of tax hikes, spending curbs and pension cuts as well as a rollback of collective bargaining agreements.In addition, 50 billion euros ($54.14 billion) in public assets are to be placed in a special privatization fund as collateral for loans of up to 86 billion euros that must be agreed with European partners.Acceptance of the tough bailout terms marked a turnaround for Tsipras after months of acrimonious talks and a referendum that resoundingly rejected a less stringent deal proposed by the lenders. But opinion polls suggest the prime minister's popularity remains high.A poll published on Saturday in the leftwing Efimerida Ton Syntaknon newspaper suggested Syriza would get 42.5 percent of the vote if an election were held now, almost double conservative New Democracy's 21.5 percent.In addition, 70 percent said they would prefer to accept the bailout deal if it kept Greece in the euro.($1 = 0.9236 euros) (Writing by James Mackenzie; Editing by Tom Heneghan and Louise Heavens)Also on HuffPost:"

The Observatory also said it had received information about the gas attack on Hasaka city but gave no further details.In a statement, the YPG said its forces had captured industrial grade gas masks in the last four weeks from Islamic State fighters, ""confirming that they are prepared and equipped for chemical warfare along this sector of the front"".MOSUL DAMIt said soldiers exposed to the gas ""experienced burning of the throat, eyes and nose, combined with severe headaches, muscle pain and impaired concentration and mobility"".""Prolonged exposure to the chemicals also caused vomiting,"" it added.The YPG said it was investigating Islamic State's use of chemical weapons with help from international experts from UK organizations Conflict Armament Research and Sahan Research.In a separate statement, those organizations said the three attacks - two in northeastern Syria and one in Iraq - were ""the first documented use by (Islamic State) forces of projectile-delivered chemical agents against Kurdish forces and civilian targets"".In the attack in Iraq, Islamic State forces had fired a projectile ""containing a liquid chemical agent at the peshmerga Mosul Dam checkpoint"", they said.

19,POLITICS,Why America Is Not The Next Greece,Daniel Marans and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-america-is-not-the-next-greece_us_55a814c5e4b04740a3df6b11,The key difference is that the United States has its own central bank -- the most powerful one in the world.,2015-07-18,<p>The United States has its own currency. The Federal Reserve controls the country's monetary supply.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a858881200002c00135396.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Watching the battle play out between Greece and Europe's financial leadership, observers in the United States might wonder how it is Greece got itself into this mess. Could such a thing ever happen here?No, it could not. The reason lies in the different structure of the United States and the European Union, and has led to much confusion in the United States, as politicians have warned that if this or that policy isn't enacted, America could become “Greece on steroids.”The key difference is that the United States has its own central bank -- the most powerful one in the world. Greece, meanwhile, does not. And while the states of the United States are genuinely united -- a common banking system, common federal budget and common political system -- the eurozone is a federation of countries with a common currency that, in the face of crisis, must largely fend for themselves.When countries’ economies slow down, they have two sets of tools at their disposal: monetary policy (adjustment of the money supply) and fiscal policy (adjustment of government expenditures). Central banks fill the demand gap of a recession by printing currency, and governments do it by spending more than they save.But in a monetary union of many countries, like the eurozone, the largest and most powerful countries, like Germany, can use their outsized influence to secure a monetary policy that works for them. Those same policies may be counterproductive for other countries with different economic needs. If Germany is concerned about inflation, for example, it may be inclined to raise interest rates, which would be devastating for the economies of countries struggling with high unemployment.And if a monetary union does not have a corresponding fiscal union, troubled countries also have limited fiscal policy tools to stimulate their economies. While fiscally centralized governments can transfer money from one part of the country to another, separate countries that run out of money in an especially severe recession must either cut back dramatically, beg their richer neighbors for help -- or, as in Greece’s case, a combination of both.Let's consider an example: Varoufakis compares Nevada and GreeceIn April, Greece's then-Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis traveled to Washington to meet with President Barack Obama and Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, one of Greece's creditors. He also sat down with The Huffington Post for an interview, and we asked him why austerity has survived in Europe as the consensus of most elite politicians and bureaucrats, whereas in the United States, it had its moment but has since become somewhat discredited.Consider, said Varoufakis, what would have happened to the state of Nevada if the United States operated as the eurozone does. ""Suppose that in 2008 the United States was structured as the eurozone was. Well, take the great state of Nevada. Its banks went bankrupt, its real estate and construction sector went under,"" he said. ""Imagine if the state of Nevada had to bail out the banks of Nevada, pay unemployment benefits, which were skyrocketing, and have no central bank standing behind it. Let me simply suggest to you that the great state of Nevada would become insolvent in one day.”The nightmare scenario Varoufakis describes is exactly what happened to Greece.Just as Nevada and a handful of other states bore the brunt of a burst housing bubble driven by Wall Street, so too did Greece suffer the worst effects of European banks’ casino lending. To be sure, until 2008, the Greek government took on loans it could not pay off -- and hired Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms to help cover it up. But it takes two to tango: German and French banks in particular lent to Greece despite knowing they were making risky bets. In fact, German and French banks had so much bad Greek debt on their books that when it looked like Greece was going to go bankrupt in 2010, European leaders feared that allowing the country to default would be an economic catastrophe for the continent. They were worried it would open other euro nations up to speculative attack, setting in motion a chain reaction to unravel the euro.But Europe’s fiscal and political divisions made the action they took to address their concerns far more complicated and less effective than it could have been -- and far less beneficial to Greece itself. What might be a standard transfer between fiscally united states required the eurozone to take extraordinary measures. And the lack of political unity within the euro area meant that the powerful eurozone nations were inclined to choose the measures that accommodated their domestic needs first and Greece’s economic needs a distant second.Bailout funds went to the Greek government, but were destined for the banksSo rather than take the politically unpopular step of bailing out the big banks directly, the German-led eurozone used the Greek government as a conduit for the funds. In 2010 and 2012, the eurozone nations, together with the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB), provided Greece with rescue loans totaling 240 billion euros. But the vast majority went toward paying money the Greek government owed its creditors, which were initially mostly big banks. Then, in March 2012, European governments bought out the remaining Greek debts on banks’ books at a discount.Whether Greece’s creditors were private or governmental, however, as of January 2015, just 11 percent of the troika’s bailout loans had gone toward funding its government. The rest went toward debt repayments.“The effect of these bailouts was to shift debt from the shoulders of privateers to the shoulders of taxpayers,” Varoufakis explained. “This is something that our parliament opposed when it was happening. We’re against it. We thought that it was a terrible deed. And we even demonstrated in the streets against those bailouts.”But for the German-led eurozone, the benefits of Europe’s stealth bailout were twofold. By bailing out the big banks through Greece and then buying out those banks’ debts, Europe both reduced risks of financial contagion from Greece and allowed its leaders to scapegoat Greece for what would have otherwise been an unpopular policy. European leaders convinced their publics that Greece’s slacker behavior was to blame for the bailouts, not their own failure to regulate their big banks -- or forge a closer fiscal and political union. They told their constituents that Greece was, at best, a welfare queen in need of discipline; at worst, they called it a “cancer,” unworthy of membership in the currency union.All of the Greece-bashing had an impact. From Finland to Spain, angry European taxpayers wanted their pound of flesh from Greece.And did they ever get it. Since 2010, Greece has implemented one of the most dramatic fiscal adjustments in modern history. In 2014, it boasted the largest cyclically adjusted, primary budget surplus in Europe. To get there, Greece’s government has raised taxes and cut spending dramatically. It employs 30 percent fewer government workers than it did in 2009; pensions have, on average, been cut by 40 percent.A broad array of economists believe this fiscal austerity has devastated Greece’s economy. In the years since Greece implemented its creditors’ austerity policies, its economy has shrunk by almost one-third, and adult unemployment remains above 25 percent.Greece’s budget tightening would not be as much of a drag on its economy if it had monetary stimulus at its disposal. By devaluing currency, a country can boost its exports and domestic consumer demand. Iceland, for example, was able to recover economically despite a massive fiscal contraction because it had its own currency and could print as much of it as it wanted.But Greece is on the euro, and the European Central Bank, which controls the euro, has not afforded Greece anywhere near enough stimulus. During much of the recent economic recovery period, the ECB’s cautious monetary policies reflected the inflation concerns of Germany.Unlike its counterparts in the United States and Great Britain, the ECB raised interest rates twice in 2011, which is believed to have contributed to the continent’s double-dip recession -- and hit struggling economies like Greece’s especially hard.Leaving Greece behindNow that the ECB has turned on the monetary gas, Greece has not shared in the gains. In January, the ECB refused to include Greece in its quantitative easing program, because it says Greece owes it too much money.In negotiations between Greece and its creditors, many experts also say the ECB has acted as an enforcer for Germany rather than a lender of last resort. That is because in addition to controlling the eurozone monetary policy, the ECB has served as a deposit insurer for troubled banks in Greece and other struggling nations -- the European FDIC. But critics note that the ECB has effectively abdicated its role as a source of deposit insurance at strategic moments to get Greece to concede at the negotiating table. Most recently, the ECB capped emergency liquidity to Greek banks in late June ahead of the Greek referendum, forcing Greece to impose capital controls that have kept its banks closed to this day. Now that Greece has reached a highly concessionary agreement with its international creditors that surrendered most of its financial sovereignty, the ECB announced that it will resume the emergency lending.It would be one thing if this at least allowed to Greece to pay off its debt. But even for the eurozone, it has been penny-wise and pound-foolish. Because Greece’s debts have grown faster than its economy, the IMF now projects that Greece will need a massive debt write-off if it is ever to emerge from the new bailout program and finance itself on the private markets again.So going back to Varoufakis’ hypothetical: Imagine a similar sequence of events happening to Nevada. It would be as though, instead of the stimulus and the federal safety net, Nevada just got TARP -- and then immediately had to start paying the tab for Wall Street banks.It sounds crazy.But if Nevada were part of the eurozone it would have been hammered in the same way. ""If [Nevada] had to go to the international markets to borrow, those borrowings, those funds, would come with austerity strings attached by the IMF. That would crush the state of Nevada completely,"" Varoufakis said. ""So austerity has staying power in Europe because we lack the automatic stabilizers you have in the United States. If we had them it would have died also. It would have been a passing phase.""Why couldn’t that happen to Nevada?Instead of begging the IMF or wealthier independent countries for money, however, Nevada simply benefitted from the “automatic stabilizers” that come with fiscal unity. Federal programs that normally support Nevadans, like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance, are built to accommodate greater demand. That means that greater outflows from the federal government to Nevada during the recession replaced some of the income lost from layoffs elsewhere. It prevented Nevada’s acute recession from becoming a Great Depression.We do not often think of them this way, but these “automatic stabilizers” are enabled by hidden transfers from wealthier American states to poorer ones. According to an analysis of government data by WalletHub -- which combined several metrics, including the ratio of federal spending to the amount a state pays in federal taxes -- states like New Jersey, Delaware and Illinois subsidize states like South Carolina, Maine and Mississippi. Nevada is somewhere in the middle: it tied Michigan for 16th least dependent on the federal government.In addition, partisan gridlock notwithstanding, the relative political unity of the United States meant there was strong public pressure to enact special fiscal and monetary stimulus policies that provided economic relief nationwide. On the fiscal side, the federal government passed an $800 billion stimulus package. That put money in people’s pockets and in state and local government coffers with a combination of spending projects and targeted tax cuts. And the federal government picked up the tab for bailing out the banks.An analysis by The Huffington Post of White House data shows that Nevada received nearly $1.6 billion in federal stimulus dollars.On the monetary side, unlike the ECB, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at or near zero since 2009. It also kept credit cheap for American businesses and consumers by buying trillions in private assets in an unprecedented program known as “quantitative easing.” Advocates who want the Fed to do more, by tying interest rate hikes to wage growth, for example, do so knowing it might benefit some parts of the country more than others.Economists Mark Zandi and Alan Blinder estimate that the stimulus alone increased U.S. GDP by 3.4 percent in 2010 -- keeping the unemployment rate 1.5 points lower than it would be otherwise.Evidence suggests that the stimulus package, and other measures, worked in Nevada too. Unemployment peaked in Nevada in November 2010 at 13.7 percent, and its unemployment rate has been dropping ever since then. As of June, official unemployment in Nevada was down to 7 percent.Is the eurozone doomed, then?It depends what is meant by ""doomed."" The eurozone is unlikely to unravel in the near future, if only because the costs of leaving the eurozone remain very high. It says something about the real or perceived risks of leaving the currency that the leftwing Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was willing to agree to Greece’s worst austerity package yet and surrender Greece’s financial sovereignty rather than face the prospect of leaving. In the near term, a Grexit would cause untold economic damage as the value of people’s savings plummeted and the cost of essential imports like food, oil and medicine skyrocketed. Tsipras apparently judged the risks to be too high.But the eurozone has lost its moral and political credibility. It does not speak well of an economic system if the main reason people are in it is because the alternative might be worse. That has the capacity to prevent it from expanding in the future, and is already inspiring a wave of extreme political movements within its borders.The Greek crisis has exposed the contradictions at the heart of the currency union: It was always a political idea awkwardly implemented through monetary means. Joining European nations under a common currency was meant to be the next logical extension of the European Union, formed to bring peace to the continent after World War II. As many warned when the eurozone was created, though, yoking countries with very different political and economic policies to the same currency could deprive them of much-needed flexibility during economic downturns. The resulting economic instability would exacerbate the very political divisions the union was meant to heal.Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman summed it up presciently in a 1997 essay.“Political unity can pave the way for monetary unity,” he wrote. “Monetary unity imposed under unfavorable conditions will prove a barrier to the achievement of that unity.”Some European leaders appear to be heeding Friedman’s advice after the fact. They are renewing their efforts to unite Europe politically and economically to bring it into line with the monetary union.“I think this is one of the lessons” of the Greek crisis, said Peter Wittig, the German ambassador to the United States, at a press briefing on Monday. “We have got to learn how to harmonize even better our fiscal and economic policies in the future.”"

While fiscally centralized governments can transfer money from one part of the country to another, separate countries that run out of money in an especially severe recession must either cut back dramatically, beg their richer neighbors for help -- or, as in Greece’s case, a combination of both.Let's consider an example: Varoufakis compares Nevada and GreeceIn April, Greece's then-Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis traveled to Washington to meet with President Barack Obama and Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, one of Greece's creditors. He also sat down with The Huffington Post for an interview, and we asked him why austerity has survived in Europe as the consensus of most elite politicians and bureaucrats, whereas in the United States, it had its moment but has since become somewhat discredited.Consider, said Varoufakis, what would have happened to the state of Nevada if the United States operated as the eurozone does. ""Suppose that in 2008 the United States was structured as the eurozone was. Well, take the great state of Nevada. Its banks went bankrupt, its real estate and construction sector went under,"" he said. ""Imagine if the state of Nevada had to bail out the banks of Nevada, pay unemployment benefits, which were skyrocketing, and have no central bank standing behind it. Let me simply suggest to you that the great state of Nevada would become insolvent in one day.”The nightmare scenario Varoufakis describes is exactly what happened to Greece.Just as Nevada and a handful of other states bore the brunt of a burst housing bubble driven by Wall Street, so too did Greece suffer the worst effects of European banks’ casino lending. To be sure, until 2008, the Greek government took on loans it could not pay off -- and hired Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms to help cover it up. But it takes two to tango: German and French banks in particular lent to Greece despite knowing they were making risky bets. In fact, German and French banks had so much bad Greek debt on their books that when it looked like Greece was going to go bankrupt in 2010, European leaders feared that allowing the country to default would be an economic catastrophe for the continent. They were worried it would open other euro nations up to speculative attack, setting in motion a chain reaction to unravel the euro.But Europe’s fiscal and political divisions made the action they took to address their concerns far more complicated and less effective than it could have been -- and far less beneficial to Greece itself. What might be a standard transfer between fiscally united states required the eurozone to take extraordinary measures. And the lack of political unity within the euro area meant that the powerful eurozone nations were inclined to choose the measures that accommodated their domestic needs first and Greece’s economic needs a distant second.Bailout funds went to the Greek government, but were destined for the banksSo rather than take the politically unpopular step of bailing out the big banks directly, the German-led eurozone used the Greek government as a conduit for the funds. In 2010 and 2012, the eurozone nations, together with the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB), provided Greece with rescue loans totaling 240 billion euros. But the vast majority went toward paying money the Greek government owed its creditors, which were initially mostly big banks. Then, in March 2012, European governments bought out the remaining Greek debts on banks’ books at a discount.Whether Greece’s creditors were private or governmental, however, as of January 2015, just 11 percent of the troika’s bailout loans had gone toward funding its government. The rest went toward debt repayments.“The effect of these bailouts was to shift debt from the shoulders of privateers to the shoulders of taxpayers,” Varoufakis explained. “This is something that our parliament opposed when it was happening. We’re against it. We thought that it was a terrible deed. And we even demonstrated in the streets against those bailouts.”But for the German-led eurozone, the benefits of Europe’s stealth bailout were twofold. By bailing out the big banks through Greece and then buying out those banks’ debts, Europe both reduced risks of financial contagion from Greece and allowed its leaders to scapegoat Greece for what would have otherwise been an unpopular policy. European leaders convinced their publics that Greece’s slacker behavior was to blame for the bailouts, not their own failure to regulate their big banks -- or forge a closer fiscal and political union. They told their constituents that Greece was, at best, a welfare queen in need of discipline; at worst, they called it a “cancer,” unworthy of membership in the currency union.All of the Greece-bashing had an impact. From Finland to Spain, angry European taxpayers wanted their pound of flesh from Greece.And did they ever get it. Since 2010, Greece has implemented one of the most dramatic fiscal adjustments in modern history. In 2014, it boasted the largest cyclically adjusted, primary budget surplus in Europe. To get there, Greece’s government has raised taxes and cut spending dramatically. It employs 30 percent fewer government workers than it did in 2009; pensions have, on average, been cut by 40 percent.A broad array of economists believe this fiscal austerity has devastated Greece’s economy. In the years since Greece implemented its creditors’ austerity policies, its economy has shrunk by almost one-third, and adult unemployment remains above 25 percent.Greece’s budget tightening would not be as much of a drag on its economy if it had monetary stimulus at its disposal. By devaluing currency, a country can boost its exports and domestic consumer demand. Iceland, for example, was able to recover economically despite a massive fiscal contraction because it had its own currency and could print as much of it as it wanted.But Greece is on the euro, and the European Central Bank, which controls the euro, has not afforded Greece anywhere near enough stimulus. During much of the recent economic recovery period, the ECB’s cautious monetary policies reflected the inflation concerns of Germany.Unlike its counterparts in the United States and Great Britain, the ECB raised interest rates twice in 2011, which is believed to have contributed to the continent’s double-dip recession -- and hit struggling economies like Greece’s especially hard.Leaving Greece behindNow that the ECB has turned on the monetary gas, Greece has not shared in the gains. In January, the ECB refused to include Greece in its quantitative easing program, because it says Greece owes it too much money.In negotiations between Greece and its creditors, many experts also say the ECB has acted as an enforcer for Germany rather than a lender of last resort. That is because in addition to controlling the eurozone monetary policy, the ECB has served as a deposit insurer for troubled banks in Greece and other struggling nations -- the European FDIC. But critics note that the ECB has effectively abdicated its role as a source of deposit insurance at strategic moments to get Greece to concede at the negotiating table. Most recently, the ECB capped emergency liquidity to Greek banks in late June ahead of the Greek referendum, forcing Greece to impose capital controls that have kept its banks closed to this day. Now that Greece has reached a highly concessionary agreement with its international creditors that surrendered most of its financial sovereignty, the ECB announced that it will resume the emergency lending.It would be one thing if this at least allowed to Greece to pay off its debt. But even for the eurozone, it has been penny-wise and pound-foolish. Because Greece’s debts have grown faster than its economy, the IMF now projects that Greece will need a massive debt write-off if it is ever to emerge from the new bailout program and finance itself on the private markets again.So going back to Varoufakis’ hypothetical: Imagine a similar sequence of events happening to Nevada. It would be as though, instead of the stimulus and the federal safety net, Nevada just got TARP -- and then immediately had to start paying the tab for Wall Street banks.It sounds crazy.But if Nevada were part of the eurozone it would have been hammered in the same way. ""If [Nevada] had to go to the international markets to borrow, those borrowings, those funds, would come with austerity strings attached by the IMF. That would crush the state of Nevada completely,"" Varoufakis said. ""So austerity has staying power in Europe because we lack the automatic stabilizers you have in the United States. If we had them it would have died also. It would have been a passing phase.""Why couldn’t that happen to Nevada?Instead of begging the IMF or wealthier independent countries for money, however, Nevada simply benefitted from the “automatic stabilizers” that come with fiscal unity. Federal programs that normally support Nevadans, like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance, are built to accommodate greater demand. That means that greater outflows from the federal government to Nevada during the recession replaced some of the income lost from layoffs elsewhere. It prevented Nevada’s acute recession from becoming a Great Depression.We do not often think of them this way, but these “automatic stabilizers” are enabled by hidden transfers from wealthier American states to poorer ones. According to an analysis of government data by WalletHub -- which combined several metrics, including the ratio of federal spending to the amount a state pays in federal taxes -- states like New Jersey, Delaware and Illinois subsidize states like South Carolina, Maine and Mississippi. Nevada is somewhere in the middle: it tied Michigan for 16th least dependent on the federal government.In addition, partisan gridlock notwithstanding, the relative political unity of the United States meant there was strong public pressure to enact special fiscal and monetary stimulus policies that provided economic relief nationwide. On the fiscal side, the federal government passed an $800 billion stimulus package. That put money in people’s pockets and in state and local government coffers with a combination of spending projects and targeted tax cuts. And the federal government picked up the tab for bailing out the banks.An analysis by The Huffington Post of White House data shows that Nevada received nearly $1.6 billion in federal stimulus dollars.On the monetary side, unlike the ECB, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at or near zero since 2009. It also kept credit cheap for American businesses and consumers by buying trillions in private assets in an unprecedented program known as “quantitative easing.” Advocates who want the Fed to do more, by tying interest rate hikes to wage growth, for example, do so knowing it might benefit some parts of the country more than others.Economists Mark Zandi and Alan Blinder estimate that the stimulus alone increased U.S. GDP by 3.4 percent in 2010 -- keeping the unemployment rate 1.5 points lower than it would be otherwise.Evidence suggests that the stimulus package, and other measures, worked in Nevada too. Unemployment peaked in Nevada in November 2010 at 13.7 percent, and its unemployment rate has been dropping ever since then. As of June, official unemployment in Nevada was down to 7 percent.Is the eurozone doomed, then?It depends what is meant by ""doomed."" The eurozone is unlikely to unravel in the near future, if only because the costs of leaving the eurozone remain very high. It says something about the real or perceived risks of leaving the currency that the leftwing Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was willing to agree to Greece’s worst austerity package yet and surrender Greece’s financial sovereignty rather than face the prospect of leaving. In the near term, a Grexit would cause untold economic damage as the value of people’s savings plummeted and the cost of essential imports like food, oil and medicine skyrocketed. Tsipras apparently judged the risks to be too high.But the eurozone has lost its moral and political credibility. It does not speak well of an economic system if the main reason people are in it is because the alternative might be worse. That has the capacity to prevent it from expanding in the future, and is already inspiring a wave of extreme political movements within its borders.The Greek crisis has exposed the contradictions at the heart of the currency union: It was always a political idea awkwardly implemented through monetary means. Joining European nations under a common currency was meant to be the next logical extension of the European Union, formed to bring peace to the continent after World War II. As many warned when the eurozone was created, though, yoking countries with very different political and economic policies to the same currency could deprive them of much-needed flexibility during economic downturns. The resulting economic instability would exacerbate the very political divisions the union was meant to heal.Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman summed it up presciently in a 1997 essay.“Political unity can pave the way for monetary unity,” he wrote. “Monetary unity imposed under unfavorable conditions will prove a barrier to the achievement of that unity.”Some European leaders appear to be heeding Friedman’s advice after the fact. They are renewing their efforts to unite Europe politically and economically to bring it into line with the monetary union.“I think this is one of the lessons” of the Greek crisis, said Peter Wittig, the German ambassador to the United States, at a press briefing on Monday. “We have got to learn how to harmonize even better our fiscal and economic policies in the future.”"

Varoufakis spoke to The Huffington Post in April about what the structure of the eurozone has to do with Greece's debt crisis. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a856911300002b0093a01c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Watching the battle play out between Greece and Europe's financial leadership, observers in the United States might wonder how it is Greece got itself into this mess. Could such a thing ever happen here?No, it could not. The reason lies in the different structure of the United States and the European Union, and has led to much confusion in the United States, as politicians have warned that if this or that policy isn't enacted, America could become “Greece on steroids.”The key difference is that the United States has its own central bank -- the most powerful one in the world. Greece, meanwhile, does not. And while the states of the United States are genuinely united -- a common banking system, common federal budget and common political system -- the eurozone is a federation of countries with a common currency that, in the face of crisis, must largely fend for themselves.When countries’ economies slow down, they have two sets of tools at their disposal: monetary policy (adjustment of the money supply) and fiscal policy (adjustment of government expenditures). Central banks fill the demand gap of a recession by printing currency, and governments do it by spending more than they save.But in a monetary union of many countries, like the eurozone, the largest and most powerful countries, like Germany, can use their outsized influence to secure a monetary policy that works for them. Those same policies may be counterproductive for other countries with different economic needs. If Germany is concerned about inflation, for example, it may be inclined to raise interest rates, which would be devastating for the economies of countries struggling with high unemployment.And if a monetary union does not have a corresponding fiscal union, troubled countries also have limited fiscal policy tools to stimulate their economies.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it crashed killing all 298 on board including 80 children. The aircraft was allegedly shot down by a missile and investigations continue over the perpetrators of the attack. (Photo by Rob Stothard/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a94ec41200002b00135639.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A year after a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all aboard, a Dutch town is remembering the victims with Ukrainian sunflowers. Flight MH17 was hit by a missile over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, amid fighting between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government. The plane was destroyed by a Russian surface-to-air missile fired from rebel-controlled territory, according to a Dutch Safety Board investigation. Hilversum, a town near Amsterdam, lost 15 residents in the crash. One year later, Hilversum residents have a new way to remember those who died -- with sunflowers grown from seeds gathered near the crash site. Crash investigators found sunflowers blooming around the twisted wreckage and human remains when they first reached the scene of the disaster, after two weeks of Russian obstruction. The flowers quickly became a symbol of hope and remembrance. Some laid the blooms in front of the Dutch Embassy in Kiev as a memorial to the victims. Paul McGeough and photographer Kate Geraghty, both journalists at the Sydney Morning Herald, made it their mission to send seeds from the crash site to victims' families and friends. McGeough wrote that they hoped the flowers would bloom as symbols of remembrance and renewal.McGeough told The Huffington Post that he sent seeds to Thomas Schansman, the father of MH17 victim Quinn Lucas Schansman, who lives in Hilversum.Some of those seeds were nurtured into flowers by the town's head gardener. Others flourished in the church of the Rev. Julius Dresme, pastor of the St. Vitus Church, where the victims' funerals were held.Seeds from those flowers were to have been given away at a memorial service Friday. They will be planted in families' gardens, as well as the schools and sports clubs they attended. ""It was a really good thought, because the seeds, they become flowers. They have seeds again, and on and on. And you can see, there's life,"" the gardener told RFE/RL. ""There will always be seeds from Ukraine now in Holland,"" he said.The MH17 disaster heightened tensions among Russia, Europe and the U.S., as the as the world blamed Russian President Putin for sponsoring and arming the separatists suspected of bringing down the plane. Secretary of State John Kerry accused pro-Russian separatists of drunkenly piling up corpses and disturbing the crash site. Rebels initially blocked international investigators from reaching the site.Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine have all called on the U.N. Security Council to conduct an independent investigation into the crash. Putin has rejected the calls as ""premature.""CORRECTION: An earlier version said an unnamed American journalist may have given the father of an MH17 victim the seeds. Paul McGeough, an Irish citizen who works for the Sydney Morning Herald, said he gave the seeds to Thomas Schansman, the father of crash victim Quinn Lucas Schansman.Related on HuffPost: "

In the past three decades, the prison population in the U.S. has ballooned due to a number of factors that have created a system rife with discrimination and other abuses. And the burden falls disproportionately on low-income people and people of color.The President made a historic visit on July 16 to a federal prison -- the first sitting president to do so. His visit spotlighted the massive overcrowding problem -- he was shown one 9-by-10-foot cell that sometimes holds three prisoners -- that is the result of a broken criminal justice system. The visit came days after a galvanizing speech at the NAACP highlighting racial disparity in U.S. prisons, and other issues such as the overuse of solitary confinement.It is significant that the President is drawing attention to these issues. But these words must be quickly backed up by actions.Consider this: the United States has under five percent of the world's population but over 20 percent of the world's prisoners. That's because over two million adults are currently in the United States' prisons and jails, putting the U.S. ahead of all other countries when it comes to incarceration rate.The U.S. mass incarceration crisis has been a long time in the making. Lawmakers in the 80s and 90s competed to see who could get more ""tough on crime."" Typically that meant passing harsh sentencing laws with mandatory minimums and longer prison terms. Lawmakers also passed laws treating youth under the age of 18 as adults and boosting detentions of immigrants subject to deportation. These policies collectively contributed to a vast expansion of the prison population and have disproportionately affected minority communities.In fact, racial discrimination runs through the core of the mass incarceration epidemic. Black males aged 18 to 19 are a full nine times more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers. Likewise, black females are twice as likely as white females to be incarcerated. The UN Human Rights Committee, which monitors states' compliance with their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has expressed ongoing concern about sentencing disparities and the overrepresentation of individuals belonging to racial and ethnic minorities in U.S. prisons and jails, calling on the U.S. to reform mandatory minimum statutes, among other recommendations.President Obama and the Justice Department are to be commended for putting a spotlight on the issue of mass incarceration and beginning to chip away at the problem. But we are in a crisis, and concerted action by the President and Congress is needed to address it. Human rights principles should guide the way forward on badly needed criminal justice reforms. That means punishments must be proportionate, free of bias and serve a legitimate purpose. And we must stop treating youth like adults and revamp immigration enforcement and detention policies.The President and Congress must convene and fund a national commission to create a strategy and timeline for addressing the root causes of mass incarceration, including disproportionate sentencing for nonviolent offenses, mandatory minimums, discrimination, youth incarceration and immigration detention. Congress must pass legislation to end racial profiling and reform mandatory minimum sentencing policies.These steps alone won't solve the United States' many criminal justice challenges. But they can help bring the criminal justice system better into line with human rights standards and break the cycle of mass incarceration.Photo Credit: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images"

When it comes to ballet, in particular, many American balletomanes appear oblivious to the bustle outside the precincts of New York City. On the subject of The Nutcracker, for example, many subscribe to the myth that George Balanchine's 1954 reinvention of the Russian classic for New York City Ballet ""sparked an American holiday tradition"" -- in the words of Laura Jacobs, who penned a fascinating exploration of Balanchine's Nutcracker for Vanity Fair, even as she played fast and loose with the essential detail of the ballet's arrival on American shores. Other scholars - like Jennifer Fisher, who wrote a sociological meditation on the industry that now props up most American ballet companies (Nutcracker Nation) - identify Willam Christensen's 1944 production for San Francisco Ballet as the first full-length American production, whose enormous popularity astonished even its creator.And now a captivating children's book arrives to set the record straight for the younger generation.In The Nutcracker Comes to America, author Chris Barton introduces us to the remarkable Christensen brothers, Willam, Harold and Lew, whose ""dance-loving, violin-playing grandfather"" emigrated from Denmark and settled in Utah. We follow the young men's zigzagging journeys from the ballet studio to vaudeville stages across the country, to New York to dance for the greats like Balanchine and Fokine, and into the army, against the backdrop of World War II. Lew, the most naturally gifted of the three, became the first homegrown American danseur noble, and a choreographer of some repute. For Lincoln Kirstein's Ballet Caravan, he created Filling Station, a comic slice of Americana set in a gas station populated with ""truckers, a gangster, a state trooper, and a little girl who really needed to use the restroom."" The restless Christensens couldn't seem to stay put. Which turned out to be providential for American ballet, especially on the West Coast. Willam brought ballet to Portland, Oregon, and later established the formidable Salt Lake City company that would be known as Ballet West. In between, there was San Francisco, where he and Harold spun off the ballet troupe from the opera company, while Lew ""traded in his ballet shoes for army boots."" It was during wartime America, when many dancers were off fighting and money was especially scarce, that Willam needed a big hit ""to keep ballet alive in San Francisco."" He loved the great Russian classics and though he'd never seen them performed - at least not in their entirety - he would research them painstakingly. As part of his research for The Nutcracker, he cornered Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova and had them recount for him as much of the detail of the Petipa production as they could recall from their own experience dancing in it.The Christensens' peregrinations, and the delightful goings-on onstage and backstage during the first Nutcracker, are illuminated in the arresting illustrations by Cathy Gendron - multiple coatings of thin oil glaze meticulously layered over pencil drawings on gesso, then lightly textured, as if burnished by steel wool. The colors glow softly on the page, and the whimsical yet realistic figures convey energy and emotion that will intrigue adults as much as children. Ballet to the People's favorite drawing is of Lew Christensen on a New York City sidewalk, still in his army uniform, having just returned from wartime service. He is looking wistfully through the windows of a ballet studio while class is in session. The narrative reads: ""[Y]ears in the army had done a number on his body. He couldn't dance like he'd danced before.""Lew would eventually bring the Balanchine technique and style to San Francisco Ballet in the early 1950's, when he took over the company reins after Willam moved to Salt Lake City. Don't be misled by the book title. This is much more than the story of the transplanting of a famous Russian ballet. And not just a book for little girls who dream of dancing in tutus and pink satin pointe shoes. This is a real-life adventure story about ""a trio of small-town Utah boys"" with grit and talent, who bucked stereotypes, endured failures and persevered, and who individually and together enriched the cultural life of America. For older readers and adults (and dance writers keen to fill in the gaps in their historical knowledge), Barton provides a more detailed timeline at the end of the book, including some marvelous vintage photos. Throughout the children's tale and the more grown-up addendum, a light wit prevails, and there is much to read between the lines. About the 1892 premiere of The Nutcracker at the Mariinsky Theatre, Barton comments laconically, ""It does not catch on."" And those who are familiar with the hard business of ballet know that it was the Christensens' sheer determination that kept San Francisco Ballet afloat for decades. English critic Richard Buckle famously groused that every Christmas brings us ""one more Nutcracker closer to death."" Yet across America, spurred by the early Christensen and Balanchine productions, and by the popularity of the brilliantly animated 'Nutcracker Suite' in Disney's Fantasia, the ballet has become a hallowed ritual -- not just for audiences, but for the legions of young performers who grow up through the ranks of mice, soldiers, Mother Ginger's children, candy canes, snowflakes, waltzing flowers, and Russian acrobats, their eyes on the prize: the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier. So many of those young dancers in training are unaware of the colorful history behind this tradition. Barton and Gendron's new book does its bit to fill that gap, with charm and wisdom."

In fact, the simpler the model, the likelier your success. No matter if you're a beginner or a seasoned fitness veteran who hasn't reached their desirable level of leanness -- master these five nutritional habits before attempting anything else.1. Focus on food choices before anything elseTo lose fat, you want to burn more energy than you take in (i.e. caloric deficit). With this in mind, the next step that the majority will do is perform a google search for ""how many calories do I need to eat to lose fat?Before calorie counting, manipulating macros or worrying about which particular diet to implement -- focus on your daily food selections. Keep it simple and focus on understanding what healthy food choices look like.Without awareness and a basic knowledge base of what to eat, all eating strategies are useless.Here's a secret: Making healthier food choices will kickstart your weight loss before any fancy dieting or exercising strategies (especially for those coming from a world of little to no activity).2. Take a balanced approach with your macronutrientsWe live in a world of extremes. It's either low carbs, low fat, the no starch diet, the DNA diet or some random detox.However, each macro serves a pivotal role with your fat loss and obtaining optimal health (internally and externally).Think of carbohydrates as gasoline that helps fuel your body during workouts and energy (i.e. glucose) for your body to function on a daily basis.Think of protein as your basic building block of life. Protein plays a key role in the development of your nails, skin, hair, and obvious ones such as muscle growth.Your fats are beneficial due to their role in satiation and proper hormone optimization.When thinking of your diet, think moderation and balance--that is what leads to lasting change. Extreme behaviors may work short term, but the weight, along with negative side effects comes back in the long run (often with extra weight).3. Have a plan for what you're going to eat each dayWillpower is a finite resource that isn't to be trusted in the long term due to its depleting energy reserves.Every day, we make thousands of decisions. Each decision we make requires energy.As we make more and more decisions each day, we start to become more susceptible to making decisions that go against what we intentionally didn't want to do.Why is that?Because of a little thing called decision fatigue. You start the day at 100%, but deciding on countless minutiae throughout the day such as what to wear--depletes your willpower.To avoid decision fatigue, it's imperative you automate as much of your habits as possible. Have a plan each day for how you're going to eat, therefore, your current emotional state nor surroundings won't sabotage your fitness goals.Will you be at work a little longer than expected? If so, prepare an extra meal or know what will be available to eat at that time.With preparation, success is a guarantee. With preparation plus automating your smaller habits, you'll have plenty of energy in the willpower tank when big decisions arise.4. Eat & experiment until you find a method that satisfies your palate and complements your physique goalsThere isn't one diet or template that is superior to another. The perfect diet is the one that fits your personality, goals, and lifestyle.The only way to obtain the perfect diet is to experiment and test until you find the perfect concoction that blends flawlessly with your goals.Your diet should almost feel effortless with little to no resistances about your particular style of eating. Meshing your lifestyle with your fitness goals increases the chances of your new healthy habits sticking. You can trick and force yourself into doing tasks for only so long until you start to resent your newly adopted lifestyle.5. Keep the big picture in mindLife happens. The unexpected often occurs, no matter how much preparation we do in order to avoid it. When the unexpected occurs, we often make poor decisions and slip up on our diets.We're not perfect, nor are we expected to be or will we ever become.Perfection is a fantasy and expecting to achieve perfection is a sure fire way to set yourself up for disappointment.Mishaps and temporary lapses off your diets won't come close to ruining all your progress. Fitness doesn't ruin itself in instantaneous moments.Keep the big picture in mind and realize that your fitness lifestyle is for the long term.If you hypothetically eat 4 times a day. That's 28 meals a week and if you had 3 out of those 28 that were less than ideal. Your compliance to your goal is still 90% and that's going to deliver the results you want.At the end of the day, it's not worth it to live within a diet that simultaneously imprisons you along the way.
