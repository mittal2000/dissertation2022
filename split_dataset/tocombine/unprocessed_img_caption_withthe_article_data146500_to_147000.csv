DiMaggio's death was exactly 18 years after his father -- described as a heavy methamphetamine user -- committed suicide. DiMaggio's friend, Andrew Spanswick, told HuffPost Crime he was worried the suspect would take his own life on the anniversary of his father's death.Spanswick saw red flags when he realized that the day DiMaggio allegedly burned his San Diego home down -- with 8-year-old Ethan and 44-year-old Christina Anderson inside -- was the anniversary of the day the man's father went missing in the 1990s. A few days later, DiMaggio's father was found dead.Just hours before DiMaggio's body was found, Spanwick was hoping his old friend would be brought to justice, where he could receive the help he needed. ""Hopefully he's not repeating mistakes and the trauma his parents brought on,"" Spanswick said early Saturday morning before the rescue operation. ""I hope he doesn't kill himself today.""In a bizarre twist of fate, an FBI helicopter spotted DiMaggio's campsite in the Cascade region of Idaho, not far from where tipsters saw him and Hannah Anderson hiking a few days prior. It wasn't immediately clear if DiMaggio fired on responding officers, but police officials confirmed he was shot dead. Anderson was unharmed and was taken to a hospital where she'll undergo crisis counseling.The case is still under investigation.On Friday, police found DiMaggio's car while investigating a tip that two horseback riders had spotted the pair on a trail several days ago. DiMaggio and Anderson were said to be in good condition, carrying the camping gear necessary for Idaho's remote wilderness.DiMaggio was said to be a good friend to the Anderson family. Police have said he had an ""unusual infatuation"" with the teen, but her own father said he never saw strange behavior. The details of what happened during Anderson's several days in apparent captivity are unclear.Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline."

So why do we hear more about Blue Ivy and Jay's controversial trip to Cuba than we do about his philanthropic efforts? To a degree, it is by design.",2013-08-11,"Jay Z performs at the Yahoo Wireless Festival at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London in England on Saturday, July. 13, 2013. Thousands of people attended the event featuring headliner Jay Z. (Photo by Jim Ross/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb434c62100006401c7f45b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the aftermath of the backlash against the Trayvon Martin verdict, Jay Z recently made headlines when he attended a New York City rally condemning George Zimmerman's acquittal. His approach was classic Jay, although not in the way one might think. Whereas Jay Z the rapper, the God emcee, is borne of braggadocio and boundless confidence; Jay Z the public figure is far more measured. He rarely soapboxes, an acknowledgement of the almost king-like position he holds in popular culture that also recognizes the public's sometimes wary view of drumbeating celebrities (think Sean Penn in a row boat).Thus, instead of dominating the rally -- making it an extension of the ubiquitous Jay-Z marketing machine -- Jay instead chose to quietly attend alongside his wife, the charming and equally influential Beyonce.Some wish Jay would do more with his clout inside the board room and amongst the MTV generation. Last week, civil rights icon and Calypso crooner Harry Belafontelashed out at the rapper-entrepreneur, admonishing him for not doing more to advance social causes.There is much wrong with Mr. Belafonte's stance. If nothing else, I recommend he review the lyrics to the raunchy ""Big Pimpin'"" before he lays out any expectation of social activism on poor Jay. Further, if he does not think Jay has done enough for the greater good of humanity, I wonder what he could possibly think of someone likeCam'ron, or the legion of other seemingly nihilistic entertainers pervading our Spotify playlists.Belafonte's recent criticism emphasizes the profound, generational misconceptions surrounding hip hop and its relationship to black culture. Hip hop is composed of artists who -- despite being labeled cultural atheists -- actively, consistently pay homage to obscure soul singers from their childhoods pioneers who made them proud of their heritage. Think Tupac's namedrop of Marvin Gaye in ""Keep Ya Head Up,"" or the foundations of Kanye West's entire discography in the early 2000s.No artist better embodies this than Shawn Carter (AKA, Jay Z, J-Hova, Jigga Man). Not only does he link the current mold of entertainers to their musical forefathers through songs like ""Ain't No Love (In the Heart of the City),"" but he consciously places himself within a larger context of African American lineage. He is, by his own admission, the fulfillment of both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.'s respective visions for black America.He is both proudly self-made and self-sufficient, while also being a uniter:I feel like a young Cassius Clay/ ...tell them rumble young man rumble/ ...Martin had a dream, Hov gotta team -- ""FUTW,"" Magna Carta Holy GrailI'm representin for the seat where Rosa Parks sat/Where Malcolm X was shot/where Martin Luther was popped -- ""The Ruler's Back,"" The BlueprintI arrived on the day Fred Hampton died -- ""Murder to Excellence,"" Watch the ThroneEvoking these leaders of the modern civil rights movement is a tipping of the hat to the sacrifices they made, and recognition that Jay has become an extension of their legacies. Or at least a fulfillment of the sort of opportunity they sought out.For years as one of the most prolific entertainers on the billboard charts, Jay Z quietly laced his albums with verses containing chock loads of social commentary (the Greek tragedy and sermonizing of ""Meet the Parents,"" the indictment of Reaganomics in ""Blue Magic"") and, occasionally, political thought.But, lyrics alone do not capture the way Jay Z has immersed himself in the political process, especially since the emergence of a politician by the name of Barack Obama. In his book Decoded, Jay-Z said of Obama:""He was my peer, or close to it, like a young uncle or older brother. His defining experiences were in the nineties in the projects of Chicago... he'd seen me -- or some version of me -- in those Chicago streets.""He goes on to further describe his deep admiration for Obama, as well as his own growing involvement in politics, mainly through promoting voter registration. This election cycle, he raised $4 million in one night alone by co-hosting with his wife a fundraiser for the president, charging $40,000 for entry to his 40/40 club. The feeling is clearly mutual -- last fall, Obama said Jay Z exemplified ""what Made in America means.""In an era where almost every celebrity seems to have their own pet cause, Jay Z's work with water purification in third world countries -- and subsequent appearance before the United Nations -- reeks more of the typical celebrity ego massage. Indeed, Jay Z's understated work for this cause (and his foundation), coupled with the way he supported Obama without upstaging him, reveals a celebrity quite serious about social justice.So why do we hear more about Blue Ivy and Jay's controversial trip to Cuba than we do about his philanthropic efforts? To a degree, it is by design. Jay's brand is the engine behind his growing $500 million empire. And no one has been savvier at defying expectations and remaining relevant than him. But, as he recognizes in Blueprint 2:Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help/They call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude/To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects/So if it is true that a mogul of Jay Z's stature has yet not ""done enough"" it is only because he has co-opted himself into being a post-racial figure... with an explicitly racial past. Just like Obama -- who he views, alongside Oprah Winfrey, as a public figure that must balance activism with an even hand. In fact, it is this fusion of activism and celebrity that could be the right modern template for the way stars conduct themselves politically moving forward.The recent book Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics provides a history of the way celebrities have impacted political discourse. From Charlie Chaplin through Warren Beatty, the author explains that stars have seen mixed results when dabbling in national discussions bigger than their art. Harry Belafonte probably is best situated in the Jane Fonda category. Many celebrities make the same mistake, damaging their brand while expounding on their personal beliefs to the point where they are pigeonholed.Jay Z seems to be adhering to the path first pursed by someone like Paul Newman, a celebrity who never let his politics overwhelm his hard-earned persona. Balancing business, politics and entertainment is like dancing on the razor's edge. But if done correctly, this approach certainly ensures for maximum impact in the years to come. And no one today seems better suited for these times than the worldly, entrepreneurial Mr. Carter.And if you can't respect that/your whole perspective is whack."

It has already announced a series of steps to curb pollution and reduce carbon emissions.The central government will direct more of its budget to fund environmental protection industries and encourage eligible companies to issue bonds, it said.($1 = 6.1230 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Sui-Lee Wee; editing by Tom Pfeiffer)"
4,WELLNESS,7 High-Protein Breakfast Ideas,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/high-protein-breakfasts_us_5b9d6bb6e4b03a1dcc87ce3e,A rule of thumb for most people is to get 20 to 30 grams of protein at a meal. This can be particularly difficult during,2013-08-10,"Steel Cut Oatmeal with Apples, Honey, and Cinnamon",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d6bb626000036007fde23.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Melinda Johnson for U.S. NewsProtein tends to be misunderstood. At times, it's flying high on a fad-diet craze, when it seems that half of our population is shunning carbs in favor of a high-protein diet. At other times, protein is forgotten completely, as people order salads with low-fat dressing in an effort to fit into their skinny jeans. While a high-protein, low-carb diet is overkill, there is good evidence that a moderate-protein diet may be the way to go.More From U.S. News: Best Diets Overall Best Weight-Loss Diets Best Heart-Healthy DietsOne reason is that we need enough protein, in combination with exercise, to build muscle or even hold onto what muscle we have. We tend to lose muscle mass as we age, and this makes our metabolism go down. In fact, one of the biggest culprits of middle-aged weight creep is due to loss of muscle mass. Muscles also become critical for quality of life as we age -- once an elderly person loses enough muscle mass, things like balance or the ability to get up out of a chair are compromised. In fact, studies have shown that many elderly people do not consume enough protein, and when this is combined with being bedridden or sedentary, their ability to be independent can decline very rapidly due to losing muscle mass.Protein also plays a role in ensuring that we don't feel hungry too soon after a meal, making it a helpful partner in a weight-loss plan. A higher-protein breakfast, in particular, has been shown to help people feel less hungry during the day and eat fewer overall calories. However, research indicates that most Americans eat the bulk of their protein later in the day, at dinner and lunch, with less protein at breakfast and in snacks. This may also be problematic for the elderly or those trying to build muscle -- recent studies suggest that spacing protein throughout the day, rather than bulking up on protein at later meals, is more helpful for maintaining or building muscle in people who exercise.A rule of thumb for most people is to get 20 to 30 grams of protein at a meal. This can be particularly difficult during breakfast. To get started, here are seven examples of higher protein breakfasts:Day One Toast with nut butter: Two slices of whole-wheat bread with 1 tablespoon of peanut butter on each, topped with sliced banana. One cup of skim milk to drink. Total: 22 grams of protein.Day Two Strawberry smoothie: Blend together 1/2 cup of strawberries, 6 ounces of plain Greek yogurt, 1/4 cup of uncooked oatmeal, a drizzle of honey (as needed) and 1/2 cup of skim milk or soy milk. Total: 21 grams of protein.Day Three Mediterranean sandwich: Whole-wheat pita with 4 tablespoons of hummus, tomato slices, 1 ounce of goat cheese and 1/4 cup of sliced almonds. Have a café latte to drink, made with 1/2 cup of steamed skim milk. Total: 22 grams of protein.Day Four Melon bowl: Half of a cantaloupe (using the center as a bowl), filled with 1 cup of cottage cheese. Total: 25 grams of protein.Day Five  Breakfast burrito: Corn tortilla filled with two scrambled eggs, sautéed onions, 1/4 cup of black beans and pico de gallo. Total: 25 grams of protein.Day Six  Apple walnut oatmeal: Cook 3/4 cups of dry oatmeal with 1 and 1/4 cup of skim milk, and add 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, plus 1 chopped apple. Sprinkle with cinnamon and drizzle with honey. Total: 24 grams of protein.Day Seven Salad for breakfast: Toss together 1/2 cup of shelled soybeans, 1/2 cup of chopped tomato and 1 ounce of mozzarella cheese. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar, and serve a whole-wheat breadstick on the side. Total: 25 grams of protein.Melinda Johnson, MS, RD, is the Director of the Didactic Program in Dietetics and lecturer for the Nutrition Program at Arizona State University, and a Spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

The collection, a partnership with cosmetics company Lancôme, will arrive just in time for the designer's New York Fashion Week presentation next month.Classic as Wu's designs may be, don't expect subtlety from the Lancôme line: ""I'm not a 'no-makeup makeup' kind of a person. There's always a look,"" Wu tells Women's Wear Daily. In fact, we got a preview of Wu's makeup back in February, when the designer tested out dramatic violet eyeshadows for his runway show.The collection, which will be sold at Nordstrom and Bergdorf Goodman, features 15 products, including eyeshadow palettes, lipsticks, mascara and nail polish. ""When you have great hair and makeup, it brings out the clothes even more,"" Wu says. ""This project feels very organic to me and is one of my favorite collaborations that I’ve ever done.""Here's hoping that our fashionable first lady enjoys the collection as much as she does Jason Wu's dresses.
