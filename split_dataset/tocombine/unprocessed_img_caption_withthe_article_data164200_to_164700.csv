1,PARENTING,Apps for New Moms: Helping Hands Come at a Developmental Price,"Catherine Steiner-Adair, Contributor

(AP Photo/Sang Tan, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc9cf2100003100c543ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's hard to be nostalgic about sleep deprivation. Or about endless nursing, a fussy baby, mountains of laundry, a to-do list longer than the last book you read for pleasure and late-night runs to Walgreens for things you would easily have remembered earlier in the day if only your brain still worked like it did before -- before a baby took over your life. We've all been there. Even so, my heart sinks a little at the steady drum roll of media reviews promoting apps and tech toys for babies and desperate parents. Every parent has desperate moments, and we're all primed for the pitch and the promise of apps and other digital devices we're told are the new must-haves for our parenting ""tool kit."" But as a child psychologist and family therapist, I spend a lot of time with new parents and young families, and it seems that the more apps and digital devices fill their toolkit, the less room there is -- literally the fewer free minutes in the day -- for the kind of intimate, just-us, face-to-face moments between parent and infant that form the very essence of emotional bonding and so much more. From birth, that one-on-one tech-free interaction is building the neurological and psychological infrastructure for your baby's future capacities to listen, learn, love and feel a sense of connection and belonging in life.One recent tech review lauded a host of new apps designed to ""lend a hand"" to new moms, especially in the first few months, when the round-the-clock needs of the baby preempt sleep for mom and can feel so tedious at times. We've all become tech junkies to some degree, so it's understandable that we'd reach for that fix when we're stressed out, bored, anxious or exhausted. Or just looking for some fun.I'm all for exercising to online workouts in the living room while babies play or nap, but the lure of the screen as a pacifier for new parents, as well as for new babies, is dangerously seductive. Here's what I mean. The reviewer wrote that ""with today's digital tools, we have some benefits our parents and grandparents did not."" I would say that too often these ""tools"" are diversions, temptations, and highly addictive distractions that your parents and grandparents didn't have to fend off!Because the truth is that more often than not, screens pull our attention away from our babies. More than just lending an invisible hand, they distract us, entertain us and allow us to multitask to the nth degree. They entice us with efficiency and the promise of never a dull (i.e., offline) moment. But so much of the early months are all about letting go of life as you know it -- letting go of the endless entertainment, the always-on, ever-connected mode that actually disconnects us from the tender potential of the moment with our baby.Yes! Parenting an infant can be tedious, humbling and frustrating beyond anything most competent and confident adults are used to experiencing in their 30-something life. But there is a deep underlying process that occurs in those hours of sleep deprivation, endless hours of nursing and trying to remember which poo was what... or when. When we are consumed by the details of our baby's everything, we change. We become parents psychologically, we become a ""we"" in the dark hours of the night as well as the light of day.In our addiction to screens, we so quickly forget that nursing is more than just feeding; that it's not just a matter of milk, but of nourishing attention: your gaze, your breath, your voice, your touch. The same goes for tedious moments, frustrating moments, seemingly empty moments that apps tend to fill; fill them the old-fashioned way. The finger games, the silly songs, the long looks into each other's eyes, all that creates that love lock that becomes the foundation for your relationship and will carry you through many a tough moment of parenting. Babies don't need our undivided attention with each feeding or every waking minute, but they do need to feel well held, in the deepest sense. They know when we are distracted. They just do. Of course it's okay sometimes to read if you want while nursing, but a screen will lock your attention in a different way than a book or magazine. We'd like to think it doesn't matter. We tell ourselves it doesn't matter. But it does. In those irreplaceable moments of baby's first months, let bedtime rock with the rhythm of your baby and you alone together. Channel your inner Madonna in live lullabies to your loving captive audience. Trade the iLife for the we life."

A Texas sheriff has told local newspapers that Kyle has been fatally shot along with another man on a gun range, Saturday, Feb. 2, 2013. (AP Photo/The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Paul Moseley)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc90d24000032005355cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As I read the news of Chris Kyle's death, it hit me very hard. I did not know Mr. Kyle personally, but I certainly did know of him, even prior to this story unfolding. The lives of Mr. Kyle and I have several parallels that made it nearly impossible for me to have not known of him. We are both veterans of the War on Terror, with Kyle serving in Iraq while I served in Afghanistan, we are both authors of popular memoirs based on the service to our country, and we both work diligently to bring a voice to those veterans returning home from war who need it the most.Mr. Kyle's work has risen him to the level of being a hero in the books of many, but the tragic cause of his death has certainly elevated his popularity to a new height. With that popularity has come criticism.I have heard, repeatedly throughout the day, one variation or another of the questions: ""That is so sad, but why would he have ever given a gun to a soldier who may have had PTSD?"" or ""Why would someone in their right mind take someone thought to have PTSD to a gun range?""As I mentioned, I didn't know Mr. Kyle, but I can certainly tell you exactly why he would take a soldier with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to a gun range.First, it is important to understand what PTSD even is.Our bodies, our minds, and our instincts are all geared toward survival. Every last person is programmed with a plethora of systems and responses that are all designed to keep us alive in even the most perilous of situations.When a person is faced with an extremely fearful, life-threatening event, the subconscious mind takes a snapshot of the stimulus activating each of the five senses at the very moment of fear. The brain records what the victim is seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and feeling at that moment. The brain then catalogs this to a quick-access system for future use. The next time the brain encounters one of these stimuli again, such as smelling the same odor that was present during the moment of fear, the brain sends a danger warning to the body. The idea is for your brain to react to the same danger, again in the future, without the need to process the situation consciously, saving time and providing a faster response.The problem with this response system is that we can't just turn it off. We are not able to tell our brain that a particular stimuli is not an actual threat, and it becomes what is known as a ""trigger."" These triggers are what set off the feeling of fear and panic in PTSD victims, and the long-term effects of living with such triggers have the ability to develop into significant mental instability for the sufferer.It is believed that one way to reduce the profoundness of the body's reaction to a particular trigger is to expose the victim to it, repeatedly, within a safe environment. Over time, the body may begin to understand that the stimuli being received is not an actual threat, and the event no longer triggers the negative effect it was once associated with.While there are numerous variations and causes of PTSD, one constant for combat veterans will almost always be gunshots or explosions; the two are almost always present during extremely traumatic events during war. The sound of a car backfiring, a balloon popping, or a firework exploding can become a powerful trigger for many combat soldiers, as they are distinctly similar to the sound of the gunshots experienced during the soldier's moments of fear. One of the best ways to reduce the power of this trigger is to expose the soldier to gunfire in a safe environment -- an environment such as a gun range with friends.The next crucial aspect to understand is PTSD and violence are not synonymous with one another. Because a person suffers from PTSD, even in profound cases, it does not mean they are any more likely to harm you than if they did not have the condition at all. Is there the possibility of violence? Of course, but that can be said of all people in any set of unknown circumstances.Now, why would Chris Kyle have brought a soldier possibly suffering from PTSD to a gun range? The answer is quite simple. It is called sacrifice. Sacrifice is a word with a concept that has become lost on many people, but certainly not all. If placing yourself in only a slightly increased risk of danger may have a profound and powerful benefit to someone else, there is nothing questionable about that action at all. In fact, it is quite commendable.Hindsight is always 20/20, and it is easy to see what can happen after it already has. However, when we make decisions in life, we don't have the benefit of hindsight, and we just go ahead and do the best we can with what we have. That is how Chris Kyle lived: doing the best he could, with what he had, to help someone else. I only wish there were more Chris Kyles in the world.For more by Bryan Wood, click here.For more on PTSD, click here. "

The accident resulted in multiple ligament tears in her knee, the New York Times reported. The 28-year-old athlete lost her balance after a jump, landing on her right leg,  The Guardian reported. She was airlifted to a nearby hospital, according to the paper, where she was being treated for a tear to her anterior cruciate ligament, as well as a tear in her medial collateral ligament. She also suffered a lateral tibial plateau fracture, according to the U.S. team's medical director Kyle Wilkens.Knee ligaments connect the thigh bone and lower leg bone. They fall into two categories: cruciate, which are found within the knee joint, and collateral, which run along the side of the knee joint. Vonn injured both her anterior cruciate ligament and her medial collateral ligament, requiring surgery.Although the injury is serious, the U.S. team released a statement that she would return next season: ""She will be out for the remainder of this season but is expected to return to racing for the 2013-14 Audi FIS World Cup season and the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi,"" they said. An orthopedic surgeon who specializes in ski injuries told The New York Times that it was entirely possible to recover in the time frame cited by the team. “Typically, the A.C.L. alone will keep her out six to eight months, at least at the high, intense level of skiing she’s used to. The M.C.L. can often heal on its own. And a fracture with an A.C.L. is commonly a minor component,"" Dr. Tom Hackett told the paper. Given the optimistic prognosis, it seems unlikely that Vonn will have any complications, but that is not always the case with multiple ligament injuries. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons wrote of such injuries:These multiple injuries can have serious complications. They can disrupt blood supply to the leg. They can also affect the nerves that supply the muscles of the limb. In severe cases, multiple ligament injuries may lead to amputation.Still, the organization concluded in their summary that in many instances, injured athletes could return to high level competition following treatment."

Quads screaming, lungs labouring, I soldier on ever higher up the steep face of Decker Glacier in Garibaldi Provincial Park adjacent to Whistler, British Columbia.Fitted with sticky touring skins for traction, my unwieldy fat powder skis shuffle along like heavy railway ties. Stuffed with warm layers, shovel, avalanche probe, water and lunch, the pack on my back begins to feel like a masochist's sack of stones. This Sisyphean toil; is it really worth it?It all depends. If you're looking for an easy day of playing in the snow, definitely not. You'll hate it; you'll hate the person who talked you into renting that touring gear, promising you an ""epic"" wilderness experience; you'll hate yourself for not signing up for spin class more often; you'll hate Mother Nature for seducing you and then cruelly exposing your feeble physiology. But if you're like me, all that poisonous self-loathing will evaporate the moment you finally reach the top of that ridge and look down upon an untamed ocean of white, its rippled lines of peaks resembling gargantuan whitecaps. And you'll crack a satisfied smile, knowing how much fun that steep slope beneath you -- the very same pyramid of pain you've spent the last hour secretly cursing -- is going to be to ski. No crowds. No controls. Just untouched, untracked powdery lines beckoning to you like sirens in a whipped cream pleasure palace. Yeah, backcountry ski touring is totally worth it if you're willing to earn those turns. From the summits of Whistler and Blackcomb, alluring wilderness ski and snowboard terrain stretches to the horizon in every direction. It's accessible, and begging to be shredded. All you have to do, as I did, is take the next step.""With the evolution of equipment on piste and heli skiing has become easier and people want to access the backcountry more and more,"" says my touring partner, Peter Smart of Extremely Canadian. Whistler's renowned steep skiing clinic founder is now taking its legendary program into the backcountry, and Smart has invited me along for the ride.Big line skiing. basic avalanche safety and mountain travel skills training are all part of the package. Suddenly, Whistler just got a whole lot larger.As we strip off our skins and prepare to let 'er rip down Decker's unblemished face, Smart explains that although backcountry touring is growing in popularity, interest in the sport has yet to hit critical mass. ""The major obstacle,"" says this former ski racer turned instructor,"" is getting the word out for people to realize that you can hire a guide and travel safely in the backcountry and have a great outdoor adventure as opposed to what you might hear about or see in the movies.""Safety, of course, is paramount. Avalanche risk is mitigated by employing members of one of the best mountain guiding associations in the world, the Association of Canadian Mountain Guides. And we start our day with avalanche transceiver rescue training before heading up the Glacier Express on Blackcomb Mountain and a rendez vous with backcountry bliss. That's right, bliss. I can't think of a better word to describe the exhilarating act of ""writing my name on the face of the Gods"", as a wise mountain man once described backcountry touring's powdery pleasures. Sure, getting to the starting line was a bitch. But like anything worth earning in life, all that toil was worth it -- not to mention an incredible aerobic workout.  More Whistler out of bounds winter experiencesHeli-skiingI'm not going to lie to you; after busting my butt earning those turns with Extremely Canadian, the sound of a chopper coming to scoop me up and onto another mountaintop is sweet music to my ears. And spending a day in a private alpine playground near Pemberton with Coast Range Heliskiing is tantamount to a walk in part on a ski porn flick. This boutique operation specializes in taking small groups of four to five people heli-skiing or boarding in some of the most spectacular ski territory in Canada, with access to over 200,000 acres of diverse terrain - from wide open powder bowls to challenging glade skiing. The day I climb aboard, we manage to shred nearly 12,000 vertical feet of untracked powder. Designed for intermediate to advanced skiers and boarders and led by professional Association of Canadian Mountain Guides certified guides, Coast Range's four run Discovery Experience package is perfect for first time powder pups. Here's a video of what you can expect.SnowshoeingLooking for something slower and mellower? Snowshoeing is one of the best ways to experience the subtle beauty of Whistler. The area gets over 10 metres (33 feet) of snowfall every year, and snowshoes allow you to travel on foot through open bowls and old-growth glades. Passing through forests of hemlock, fir and cedar, you'll enter a world of rare and peaceful serenity. Guided tours are available at Green Lake or Whistler Mountain, or you can head farther afield to wilderness areas like Joffre Lakes Provincial Park. .The Adventure Group Whistler and Canadian Wilderness Adventures both offer guided snowshoe tours.Cross-country skiingSkiing doesn't have to be all about fall lines, lift lines or the quest for perfect powder. Cross-country has been an integral part of alpine culture for centuries and it combines great cardiovascular exercise with the chance to travel quickly and silently through snow-laden trees. The Whistler area has some world-class cross-country terrain, with over 130 kilometres (81 miles) of trails on offer. Check out Lost Lake Park -- it's close to Whistler Village and includes lighting for night skiing and a warming hut. Beginners' lessons available for both classic and skate technique.If You GoWhere to stayNestled at the base of Blackcomb Mountain, the historic Fairmont Chateau Whistler is the resort's landmark ski-in ski-out hotel.

""It's crazy good."" ""A crazy-boy-meets-wacky-girl romance."" ""Crazed but uncrazy lovers."" ""Certifiably nuts.""This is, of course, because this romantic comedy, nominated for eight Academy Awards, is not just about cute screwball behavior (though there's plenty of that) but about real mental illness, which it approaches irreverently, but also frankly and with unusual empathy. In Silver Linings Playbook the mania and the meltdowns have a serious side, and a diagnosis. Our hero, Pat Solitano, is a charming and volatile young man with bipolar disorder who has just been released from eight months in a psychiatric hospital to which he was committed after beating up his wife's lover. He's practically vibrating with intensity as he returns to his parents' home, armed with new knowledge about his disorder, required visits to a therapist, and medication he's disinclined to take. Obsessed with the delusion that he's going to win back his wife -- who, by the way, has taken out a retraining order against him -- he spends a lot of time running around the neighborhood to keep in shape (and, we hope, burn off some of that energy), wearing a garbage bag over his clothing to induce more sweating.From the beginning, Pat is appealing and scary in equal measure, and when he meets his match in a sultry and seriously-depressed widow named Tiffany, the result is edgy and unpredictable attraction, and, to me, it's riveting. But this isn't a movie review, so whether or not the movie eventually veers into disappointing conventionality, or whether or not the Hollywood ending is too sweet isn't really the point. The depiction of mental illness is sharp and engaging, with immensely-talented leading actors, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, playing flawed but terribly-likable people. And they're surrounded by more of the same: family and friends who are odd and obsessive themselves, but also warm and forgiving and unembarrassed by eccentricity. Part of the message of the movie is that it takes a lot of mutual support for people to be their best selves, whether or not mental illness is involved. And that if we're not afraid of mental illness, and we don't try to hide it, we can help people manage their symptoms and live up to their potential. It's when Pat realizes who his real love interest is that he is motivated to take his medication and give up his delusions. The movie also places Pat's struggles in an interesting context. His father, played by Robert DeNiro, is a Philadelphia Eagles obsessive with full-blown rituals and a history of outbursts at games that have gotten him banned from the stadium. You find yourself thinking there's a familial element to Pat's disorder, genetic loading of some kind. But the theme of sports rituals and superstitions helps make a bigger point: that in the broad spectrum of human behavior, the dividing line between what's considered normal and what's not can be pretty hard to discern. This comes into focus most forcefully in a funny scene in the parking lot at an Eagles game, where even Pat's mild-mannered Indian psychiatrist is wearing face paint and getting pumped up. When the pregame partying degenerates into mayhem, Pat, who is the one with the diagnosis, is the last guy to succumb to the frenzy. The movie has been marketed with YouTube videos of football fans talking about their superstitions, ranging from a guy who can't wash his jersey unless his team loses to a woman who has to hold her breath before every snap. (Eagles quarterback Michael Vick, by the way, has to eat exactly three chocolate chip cookies the night before every game.) Budweiser has recently made a bunch of commercials about football fan rituals that has the tag line: ""It's only weird if it doesn't work."" Which is, in its own way, a kind of advertisement for the openness the movie promotes.
