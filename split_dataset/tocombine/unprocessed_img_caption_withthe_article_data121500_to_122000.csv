0,ENTERTAINMENT,Illmatic: 20 Years Later,"Rap Genius, ContributorThe Internet's premier hip-hop lyrics website",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/illmatic-20-years-later_b_5267936.html,"To commemorate the 20 year anniversary of Illmatic, I've tried to capture a few lines of what makes each of the 10 tracks so phenomenal.",2014-05-07,"This image released by the Tribeca Film Festival shows Nas in a scene from the documentary, ""Time is Illmatic."" The film, which follows the trajectory of Nas? 1994 landmark debut album, ""Illmatic,"" will open the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival on April 16. The festival will run through April 27. (AP Photo/Tribeca Film Festival)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e4f017c2300008b040beb06.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Brandon GrossAs life-altering introductions to new music usually go, they typically happen by way of an older sibling, or in my case, my best friend's older sibling. In hindsight my influence's Beverly Hills-Jew-boy obsession of all things hip hop (and at the time, that really meant ""Black"") seems cliche, however, Alex was what we'd now call an ""early adopter."" Stacks of The Source magazine piled high in the bathroom, sliding dresser drawers with built in cassette tape space were filled with every release ever mentioned in the mags, and the walk in closet was lined with baggy Girbaud denims. Alex was a high school senior doing typical LA senior kid things out of reach of my pre-bar mitzvah status, so the music and weed smoke that seeped through the door was kept at a distance until I joined, Alex, his brother (my pal) Adam, and their family on a trip through the Holy Land. It was on this trip, stuck on a small bus riding through the Israeli desert, that a pair of yellow Walkman Sport headphones were plugged into my virgin ears. From the walkman pumped the upbeat and easily accessible Michael Jackson ""Human Nature"" sampled ""It Ain't Hard to Tell,"" the first single by a then 19-year-old rapper called Nas. ""This dude is what's up... he's like the second coming,"" Alex claimed. Probably an insight ripped from the pages of The Source, but it was true. (Upon meeting Nas I supposedly told him that he was ""the messiah of rap,"" which my crew still teases me about to this day.)But that moment was the catalyst for what has since been my ongoing love affair with hip hop. This adolescent fling has lasted the test of time, most likely because it was built on the foundation of a true classic, Illmatic. As any music lover can relate, my musical leanings have shaped a large part of who my friends are, professional pursuits, personal identity, and the lens in which I view the world. And 20 years after the album's release, it's clear that this isn't simply a case of my impressionability, but in fact, the album stands strong like Masada among the annals of few and far between flawless hip hop records. Nas is the quintessential street poet. A sensitive thug with an uncanny ability to portray a complex and vivid look into the grimey underworld of New York rarely accurately depicted. His beef with Jay, and the Oochie Wally identity crisis is easily forgivable when you think about your own maturation and evolution from kid to adult. Watching Nas as a guest on Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect was cringe-worthy, awkward at best, though demonstrated the characteristically bashful and introverted personality of many other gifted poets (e.g. B. Dylan)To commemorate the 20 year anniversary of Illmatic, I've tried to capture a few lines of what makes each of the 10 tracks so phenomenal.The Genesis I didn't realize until years later that it was a sample from the groundbreaking NY street/graf film ""Wild Style,"" which was pretty obscure. It also opens with Nas' at the time only prior recorded appearance from ""Live at the BBQ,"" the teaser verse that really started all the pre-Illmatic buzz. It's so raw, hearing Nas and his crew talking shit, ""when it's real, you doing this even without a record contract... been doing this since back when."" This is where it all started. Goosebumps to this day.N.Y. State of Mind I didn't get this track at first. It's salty, grimey, rough on the edges. As a Cali kid having spent little time on the bitter East Coast, it was tough to relate, and I'm not even talking on a socio-economic level, I just mean the sound. But over time, like how our palate's evolve to appreciate bitter wines over Maneshevitz, this track is pure vintage. The lyrics, the vibe, so effortlessly capture a dystopic NYC at the time. ""In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays/Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze /Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed/ From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black."" It heightened my empathy for what it must have been like in the projects of NYC without being preachy. It's just hard as fuck. Life's a Bitch The only guest feature on the entire album, meanwhile only a couple MC's today can carry an entire record without a guest feature on every single track. Nas's pal, AZ, is passionate here, he also sounds like he's 16. ""Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high"" essentially an enjoy the moment mantra Eckhart Tolle could get behind. Nas' father plays sax on the end of the track. The guy is the son of a jazz musician, it's clearly in his blood. There's melancholic optimism woven into this track, it's not all doom and gloom. It's a gorgeous tune. The World is Yours My top tune for a hot minute. The jazzy upbeat piano riff is inspiring. It's a feel good track that like the track before packs a punch of optimism while rooting the realities of everyday living in lyrics like ""dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled, caught by the Devil's lasso, shit is a hassle."" It reminds me of one of the first times I visited NYC on my own. I hopped a cab from JFK and sparked wide-eyed conversation with a South Asian immigrant cabbie ""New York City is the BEST! What an incredible city."" He laughed, ""Not really, we're just here working to the bone so we can get the fuck out of this place."" Halftime This track took years for me to fully appreciate. It comes halfway through the album and almost acts like a breather for just how real the album is about to get. The pace keeps the momentum moving. It affirms Nas' knack for clever wordplay, historical references, and all around confident flow. It sounds like it was recorded in one take, it's just that fluid. ""You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer, that's like Malcolm X, catching the jungle fever."" Memory Lane (Sittin' in da Park) The track's organ and background ""ooohhhh"" is so soulful and really softens the rest of the album's rusty new york city edge. You could shut your eyes listening to this and be transported to whatever the equivalent of a lazy Sunday porch swing with your homies is. There's a ton of multi-layered slang that even after years of ghetto speak self-inculcation I still don't understand, but it doesn't matter. It's really just a dedication to those no longer with us, deceased, behind bars, whatever. Nas is a poet of the people. One Love I'll stand by this poetic letter to a locked up homie as the heaviest, most heartfelt and emotional hip hop tracks ever #yesemo. I searched far and wide for the original and rare Heath Brothers sample Q-Tip used to power this track and finally found it in a basement in London. Nas essentially reassures his incarcerated fam to ""stay strong"" and not to worry, ""out in New York the same shit is going on/the crack head's stalkin', loud mouths is talkin'"" Nas is the mouthpiece for a collective boiling point here. On one hand it's frustration with 'the system' but also an existential crisis never heard before and rarely again in the genre. ""Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack/Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts/Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera/Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er/So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad / For the weekend hittin L's while I'm sleeping/A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone/To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home."" He just keeps running on the track. This is a sentimental rallying cry to rise up. One Time 4 Your Mind Maybe the least accessible track on the album for non-hip hop fans. Also the shortest in run time. It still crushes. It's a bit of a coming of age, chest beating rap in which Nas proclaims his arrival on the rap scene. He manages to balance braggadocio and humility here, all the while letting the vets know he's a force to be reckoned with. The ease in which he delivers his bars here is mark of a genius. Kind of like how McEnroe played tennis. Represent ""Represent"" reminds any suburban kid maxin' back in the safety of his mom's SUV that the projects are definitely no fucking joke. The opening line barrels out and sets the tone ""straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle/get murdered on the humble"" as a crew of homies barks threats from the background. Another track that I didn't necessarily 'get' upon my first listen of the album, but is now probably my #1. It just gets you so amped up as his crew shouts the to the point chorus ""represent, represent."" The monikers of his homies he calls out in the end puts any Goodfellas mobster roll call to shame with names like ""Droors,"" ""wallet head,"" ""Lakey the kid,"" ""Black Jay,"" ""Big Ooogie,"" and ""the Hillbillies."" If the NRA were to embrace any hip hop track, this one definitely makes a good case for why everybody should be packing a 9mm... it just sounds so cool.It Ain't Hard to Tell I talk about this tune upfront. The lead single that was the bait for the album to begin with. It started as my favorite, poppy, accessible sample, fun... over time it's catchiness waned for me and felt almost too superficial. But there's plenty of genius here. It's the perfect gateway drug for the rest of the album and for me, quality hip hop. Also check on the great NPR ""Making of Illmatic"" piece here. My Nas ""Life is Good"" review for Mass Appeal."

Kasich will face Ed FitzGerald, who won the Democratic nomination Tuesday, in the general election.The Associated Press reported earlier:Tuesday marked the beginning of the political primary season in earnest, and over the next several months Republicans will hold numerous contests featuring incumbents or other establishment figures against tea party challengers. Some of the races are in states where the identity of the party's candidate might mean the difference between victory and defeat this fall, such as Alaska, Georgia, Iowa and Kentucky. In other areas, it will matter less, including Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma and South Carolina.In the marquee race of the night, Tillis and a pair of political novices, newcomers, obstetrician Greg Brannon and Mark Harris, a Baptist pastor, led a field of eight candidates vying for the right to take on Hagan, a top target for Republicans angling for control of the Senate in the fall.Tillis ran as a conservative with the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Right to Life Committee and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, while Brannon had the backing of Sen Rand Paul of Kentucky, a tea party favorite. Harris countered with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, whose popularity with evangelical voters briefly made him a force in the race for the 2008 presidential nomination.State law set a runoff for July 15 if no candidate gained more than 40 percent of the vote, an outcome party officials said they hoped to avoid in order to maximize their chances against Hagan. One voter, Debbye Krueger of Salisbury, North Carolina, said, ""I think the tea party has pulled the right so far to right that they're falling off the cliff. And, anybody who's moderate or uses any ounce of decorum to make a logical decision not based on political affiliation is demonized.""Dan Coutcher, a chaplain at North Carolina State University, said he voted for Brannon, who he said had delivered his grandchildren.

No two nations have ever had a total ban on spying on each other. All governments seek to read the diplomatic traffic of all other governments, friend or foe. And all spy in some circumstances on residents of other countries as well as their own citizens. There sometimes can be good reason for this (some of the pre-9/11 plotting happened in the U.S. and some in Hamburg). But this does not mean that the chancellor's mobile phones or the emails of all German citizens are fair game for the U.S.'s National Security Agency (NSA). The interaction between the two governments on this issue got off to a very bad start in light of the understandable outrage of the German government and people about these reports of American spying. The U.S. government's failure to respond constructively was in turn based on its belief that German demands were unrealistic and to some degree hypocritical. The American government does seem to have wisely ended its practice of routinely seeking to listen in on the cell phone calls of friendly leaders, including Merkel. At their meeting in Washington, D.C., the two governments recorded some progress but noted some unspecified differences and agreed to set up a working group. This bilateral group should consider a new approach to resolving this problem. The work must focus on reaching agreement on the circumstances when the use of surveillance against residents of democratic countries is legitimate. Achieving a public agreement along these lines is necessary to remedy the breach of trust between the United States and not only Germany but all of Europe and other countries such as Brazil. The starting point should be a commitment by the two governments to reach an understanding that provides for reciprocal restraints in their surveillance of private U.S. and German citizens. President Obama took the first steps toward such an agreement in a speech in January and a Presidential Policy Directive. Those documents may constitute the first public statement ever made by any government accepting the notion that citizens of other countries, not physically in the host country, have privacy rights that need to be respected. As a reciprocal measure, Germany should announce that it shares the view that citizens of other countries are entitled to have their privacy respected and that it will refine and make public the limitations it is imposing on its intelligence services. Building on this common understanding, the two governments should agree to initiate a process designed to develop standards and guidelines for surveillance of private persons that each government would commit to incorporating into its own domestic laws. Other democratic governments, both in Europe and across the globe, should be invited to commit to the same goal and join the effort along with other stakeholders, including Internet companies and civil society organizations.The guidelines should require that the rules governing surveillance of private persons be enacted into law and that each government be required to provide a clear and complete explanation of what surveillance is permitted and under what circumstances. The guidelines should cover direct surveillance, searching large data bases, and minimizing the use of personally identifiable information. The guidelines should provide for effective oversight of the intelligence activity consistent with each country's traditions and provide for the right of redress for anyone improperly surveilled. The successful negotiation of such standards will go a long way to restore the trust of democratic governments in each other and of their citizens in their governments and intelligence services."

For those tuned into day-to-day operations, it was an ominous, but not-so-surprising development:""American subscriptions have slowed, and its international push has been wobbly,"" the magazine noted, including a quote from an industry analyst who observed that the company would need to ""pull a rabbit out of its hat.""Fast-forward to May 2014 and three things are clear: Netflix has changed the video distribution and consumption game, House of Cards and Orange is the New Black deserve a good portion of the credit, and the company's analytical model has the potential to directly shape the digital strategies of candidates running for president in 2016. The rabbit is out of the hat. All hail President Underwood.First, a bit of context: In 2012, Democrats outsmarted Republicans in nearly every aspect of digital outreach and engagement, resulting in a significant turnout advantage on election day. The Obama campaign built on its existing infrastructure from 2008, developed new online platforms that empowered supporters at the zip code level and dominated the overall conversation across Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and other social media channels. This approach quickly emerged as the new gold standard.As I wrote last week, the rise of ""big data"" is now leading to an overall automation of social media analytics, which requires a far greater focus on qualitative analysis to ensure that raw data leads to actionable insights. Matching online and offline data, developing individual profiles to target the right voters via paid and organic strategies and engaging supporters through dashboards and social media platforms on a daily/hourly basis will continue to drive both political parties.But this is largely an evolution of the 2012 model, in which the content delivery platforms we increasingly rely upon were still in their nascent visual stages. Netflix, in particular, was struggling to get its footing as a streaming provider of random, often B-rated content. It's been widely reported that the Netflix content delivery model is as follows: Give the consumer what he/she wants by constantly analyzing viewing habits, from the point a movie, television show or video clip started and/or stopped, to the number of times it was watched, to time of day, to day of the week, to order of viewed content, etc. As Joris Evers, the company's director of Communications told the New York Times last year, ""There are 33 million different versions of Netflix.""By all accounts, voters are also becoming much more selective as to how they view, share and digest content. If 2004 was the blogging election, 2008 the social election, and 2012 the verb election, I have no doubt that 2016 will be the Netflix election. Voters will become less tolerant of overall quantity of visual content and more apt to identify with candidates and campaigns that understand what resonates and why -- down to the single phrase in the 30-second ad that captures the most stops, starts or shares. Within hours, if a message doesn't closely align with this feedback, it will be an indicator that a campaign doesn't understand the full value of predictive analytics. The same goes for opposition research, in which content that falls flat provides an opportunity to sharpen a point of criticism or avoid repeating a similar mistake. Data mining and list building, which have largely powered digital campaign strategies up to this point, will without question become far more automated as it becomes easier to identify potential supporters through shared traits. However, as effective content marketing is embraced by political organizations, precision of overall message becomes all the more important, especially in an era that analyzes spoken, written and visual preferences down to the second or millisecond.Admittedly, content is just one factor in a broader set of opportunities and challenges facing 2016 presidential campaigns. But delivery and consumption behaviors are changing by the hour. Visual rules the day. We view what we want, when we want to view it and expect more of the same vs. frequent surprises.Get ready, the Netflix election is coming."

And to be honest, you're not exactly my favorite professionals I have to deal with. You guys tend to be a little handsy, and I'm not a huge fan of having to take my shoes off before I get to board my flight. Also, you took a corkscrew from me once. Not cool.So honestly, I'm a little surprised that I'm writing this letter to you, Mr. JFK TSA Agent (sorry, I was too much of a wreck to catch your name).I'm not going to mince words here: I was a mess. I was on the verge of tears from frustration, out of breath from running through the terminal, and wet from the downpour of rain outside. When I first ran up to you, begging for help, I think you may have thought I was mentally unstable. Really though -- I didn't blame you for asking how old I was and if I was traveling alone. I looked more like a lost little kid than a 22-year-old on a business trip. But you held it together when I lost it completely. You helped me take some deep breaths, wipe my eyes, and stop looking so completely batshit crazy. You led me out to the ticket counter, helped me cut the security line, and personally vouched that I was ""with you"" in a place not really known for letting things slide. You listened to my story -- how I'd been deplaned because of faulty brakes, then delayed four hours because of an issue with FAA's radar, then my flight disappeared from the departure board -- all of which worked in a combined effort to bring me, on the brink of a breakdown, to you. You were helpful, and you'd be surprised how many other people I asked that weren't. You didn't patronize me, or make me feel ridiculous for crying in an airport terminal. Although that would've been a fair response.I don't think to you it was a ridiculously big deal. At least I hope it wasn't -- but frankly it was five minutes out of your day, and I'm sure you've seen worse. But what I hope is a big deal is how big of a deal it was to me. After a frantic afternoon with a surprisingly large number of mishaps from my favorite airline, the five people I had encountered before you were patronizing, belittling and rude. All I wanted were answers and a bit of help, and all I got were a lot of people telling me they couldn't help me.I wish I had gotten your name, but I hope you know the impression you left on me. I'm sure you encounter ruder people than the ones I encountered at a much higher rate than I did, and I know my problems are small in the greater scheme of things. But they're my problems and they are big to me, and I appreciated you for respecting them. So thanks, TSA dude. And Go Rangers!Best, Frantic passenger looking for flight 413"

With his robust skill and size, Aldridge, the second overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was already one of the league's premier power forwards and most challenging match-ups. But this year's leap was tangible: The statistical improvement in the Portland Trail Blazers star jumps off the page. Despite his playing fewer minutes, Aldridge's scoring average this season has increased from 21 to 23, his rebounding from 9 to 11 and his free throw shooting to 82 percent, all career highs. He's also tied his career high in assists. When he's not on the floor, Portland's scoring and defensive metrics suffer dramatically, per NBA.com.More importantly, his postseason play for ""Rip City"" has been the fulcrum of its success. He recently became just the third player ever to score 40-plus points in Games 1 and 2 of a playoff series on the road, joining the likes of Michael Jordan and Tracy McGrady, and he has surpassed all but two players -- Jordan and Jerry West -- in combined points (89) in the first two playoff games. After scoring 30 to help close out Houston in the first round -- mostly while Houston's titanic Dwight Howard was on the floor -- Aldridge trails only LeBron James in playoff scoring. And he's converting 54.6 percent in the all-important true shooting percentage, which measures a player's shooting efficiency.Though his notable improvement may be a surprise to some, it comes from a conscious decision by Aldridge to upgrade his approach to the game.He recognized that even with two consecutive All-Star appearances before this year (now three), he needed to do more if Portland wanted to win its first playoff series since 2000. ""I knew that if this team had a chance to go somewhere, I had to try to be elite in both areas, as far as scoring and rebounding,"" he told The Huffington Post. ""I felt like it was something that I could do if I put my mind to it. ... I [wanted] to show I belong and still prove that I'm the best power forward in the game.""Aldridge believes that fatherhood -- he has two boys -- has helped him evolve into a more complete person, which in turn has helped him on the floor.""It takes pressure off of you, I think,"" Aldridge said. Before he had kids, he said, ""if I had a bad game, it would just eat at me and I would let it dwell. ... When I had my first son, it kind of taught me how to have a bad game but not kill myself and just try to bounce back the next game, because I knew that, no matter what, my son still loved me. ... He showed me how to have that balance of work and personal life.""This year, Aldridge, a self-proclaimed ""Shameless"" and ""Scandal"" fanatic who naps every game day, has discovered that precise balance he needs to fully release his immense potential. The 6-foot-11 power forward was never viewed as some freewheeling talent who did whatever he wanted, but at 28, the co-team captain has finally embraced his leadership role.""I think I've definitely taken on the role better,"" Aldridge said. ""I try to lead better this year as far as being vocal. ... I feel comfortable telling guys to do what I'm doing. I think this year I've definitely gotten out of my box.""Aldridge's transformation was not a sure thing, however. During his eight years in the league, he has endured a slew of coaching and roster changes (e.g., the loss of Greg Oden and Brandon Roy), and he had long been rumored to be a departing free agent -- but no more. Head coach Terry Stotts has praised his star's dramatic upgrade all season. Reserve Blazers point guard Earl Watson, a 13-year NBA veteran who has been around plenty of talented players who did not embrace their own possibilities, has also noticed a change in Aldridge's demeanor this season.""All he cares about is winning every possession and game so badly,"" Watson said. ""It fuels our team culture.""Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.

10,BUSINESS,The New Bank Innovation Platform,"Spiros Margaris, ContributorInvestment Strategist, Innovation Consultant, Investment Advis...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-new-bank-innovation-p_b_5221558.html,"One of the greatest benefits of an open innovation platform for a financial institution is that they can honestly say that they listen to what clients and potential clients want and, perhaps, more importantly what they need.",2014-05-06,2014-04-28-MargarisAdvisoryBankInnovationPlatform.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-28-MargarisAdvisoryBankInnovationPlatform-thumb.png,"It's about time that banks listen to what clients want and along the way figure out what they really need.It will probably be difficult for banks to find clients or people who are enthusiastic about them or their products and services in light of recent crisis and scandals such as the Libor rigging or the foreign-exchange fixing.However, the deeper problems lie in the loss of trust and the disengagement between the financial institutions and the client needs. Financial institutions should take a hard look on how their current approach of launching new products and service for their clients hits the mark of fulfilling client true needs. Market research alone will not provide a real or whole picture of what customers need and want.A better approach for financial institutions to find innovation and inspirations is the use of crowdsourcing and open innovation.The bank can get access through an innovation platform to potentially great ideas, innovations and inspirations, which would not happen within their organization because the 'outside of the box' thinking is often difficult if one is in the box.Although some financial institutions have crowdsourcing innovation platforms set up, it has not been applied the way as recommended in this proposal. Through an open innovation platform members can exchange ideas, innovations and thoughts. The bank will get instant feedback on what works or what customers want. If the interest in the idea is big enough, a bank committee can further evaluate the proposals and apply its own criteria, such as feasibility, profitability, market potential, and the customer's added value to come to a conclusion. How does a bank get enough members to participate in the innovation platform who also have the necessary knowledge and more importantly interest? The right incentive mechanism solves one of the greatest challenges of how to keep the platform alive and interesting for the participating members. It complements the use of social media and gamification in an effort to attract and retain people.In order to keep the platform alive, the incentive mechanisms must reward not only the idea provider, but also the contributors who improve an idea.Many companies have some incentive mechanisms in place to compensate team members who contributed to a product or services. The problem with that current practice is that it works only for quantifiable contribution.The proposal solves that problem by rewarding also the not quantifiable contributor who provided constructive and useful inputs to the original idea, regardless if their contribution is quantifiable or not, in the revenue sharing of implemented product or service.The inclusion of the not quantifiable contributions in the monetary reward creates true added value for the crowdsourcing innovation platform.In order to assess the contributions that are not quantifiable we need to consider the opinion of their peer members and the bank's committee as how much their contribution was helpful in the final solution, even though the contribution might not show or be obvious to the outside observer. It is of its utmost importance that the key contributors are participating in the incentive mechanisms, because otherwise the interest to improve an idea with constructive thoughts and proposals will be limited. Many people tend to criticize ideas, therefore, hindering innovations instead of giving constructive comments.The bank must check also potentially small and seemingly unpopular ideas for their potential, since big things often have small beginnings.The benefits of such an open innovation platform can be tremendous for a bank -- with low costs to set it up and run it, but with enormous success potential. One key advantage is that members provide innovations or ideas for free which the community of the platform reviews. The members will in the process also identify many of the benefits and risks.Further, the bank will get access to a pool of people and fans that will freely share their thinking and wishes. This pool of participants can start new trends that will likely result in a win-win situation for bank and clients. Finally, clients or potential clients will be integrated into the innovation process, and feel that their needs are understood and taken seriously by the bank.The bank should not restrict members of the platform what ideas or thoughts they can or should discuss. Then they will have an open innovation platform that allows crowdsourcing to unfold its full potential.The platform will further strengthen if the bank provides useful tools (research, videos, discussion forums, market data, and quotes) to its members.An example of such an innovative proposal could be the 'Win-Win Fee Model' (see Huffington Post article 'Win-Win Fee Model' Revolutionizes Financial Industry Fee Model). Such a proposal would then be analyzed and improved by the members of the platform and then evaluated by the bank's committee and finally maybe implemented. The members of the platform can be students, academics, investors, geeks, nerds, clients or interested people who want a solution to their needs come to life in a product or service.Since the bank does not push any products or services to clients on their platform, it only has to address topics such as compliance, regulation or distribution among other things, when they evaluates the proposal or when they incorporate it.One of the greatest benefits of an open innovation platform for a financial institution is that they can honestly say that they listen to what clients and potential clients want and perhaps more importantly what they need.  „Necessity is the mother of all invention.""

Whatever the circumstances, a divorce marks the death of the dream of happily-ever-after and the end of a relationship that was entered into with hope, joy and the intention that it be until-death-do-us-part.Ironically, news of the impending divorce of Bishop Gene Robinson and his husband Mark Andrew ""went public"" while my fiancé and I were shopping for rings for our June wedding. And I found myself dealing not only with my own sadness for a couple I know and love, but with reporters calling for comment. Here are some of the questions I got:1. Does Gene and Mark's divorce ""undermine the case for marriage equality?""No. On the contrary, I think it strengthens it. I think it helps make the point those of us advocating for marriage equality for same-sex couples have been making for many years. And that is simply that our marriages are equal. They are equally blessed and equally challenging. They are equally full of joy and equally full of disappointment. We equally love and cherish each other and we equally hurt and misunderstand each other. And, when a marriage fails, we are equally sad, scared and heartbroken. Just as the values that make up a marriage transcend the gender of the couple in the marriage, so do the challenges. And because all of our marriages are -- for better or for worse -- equal, they deserve equal protection under the law.2. But what about the ""until death do us part"" part? Doesn't divorce make a mockery of that vow?What I believe is that the vow ""until death do us part"" is absolutely binding on absolutely every marriage. And what I know is that sometimes the death that ends a marriage isn't the death of one of the partners but the death of the marriage itself. And when that happens, the faithful thing -- the honest thing, the healthy thing -- is to grieve the death of the marriage. And then, from a Christian perspective, to trust the Easter promise that love is stronger than death -- even the death of a marriage.3. Has Gene Robinson ""let down"" all those who supported his ordination as a bishop and look to him for spiritual leadership?No. Gene Robinson is dealing with the end of his marriage to Mark Andrew the same way he had dealt with all the other life challenges he has faced throughout his ministry: with honesty, integrity and the kind of transparency that inspires the rest of us to, as the scripture says, ""go and do likewise."" In John 8:32 Jesus told us "" the truth will set you free"" -- and Gene Robinson's commitment to telling the truth... even when it's inconvenient, uncomfortable or difficult... is exactly the kind of leadership we ask of our bishops: ""to be in all things a faithful pastor and wholesome example for the entire flock.""And all those led me to my own question:4. What does Gene Robinson's divorce teaches us about marriage?It teaches us that even good people of deep faith with the best intentions can fail at making the marriage they hoped would be forever last forever. It teaches us that telling the truth about our lives and our challenges is not only healthy for us but can be in inspiration for others. And, most of all, it teaches us, in Gene Robinson's own words: ""Love can endure, even if a marriage cannot."""
