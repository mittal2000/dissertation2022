(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d22b24000051005771c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two new surveys highlight Americans' widespread discontent. Chris Christie's home state reputation remains tarnished. And a GOP incumbent survives in Kansas, but by a narrower-than-expected margin. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, August 6, 2014.AMERICANS HAVE LITTLE FAITH IN WASHINGTON - Jennifer Agiesta: ""Congress has checked out, and the American people have noticed.Three-quarters of Americans doubt the federal government will address the important problems facing the country this year, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll. All told, only 28 percent of Americans think the nation is heading in the right direction, the lowest level in August of an election year since 2008. It's about on par with 2006, when Democrats took control of the U.S. House amid a backlash to the Iraq war. This time around, it's not clear whether either party will benefit from the disaffection. One-third say they hope the Republicans take control of Congress outright this fall — which the GOP can accomplish with a net gain of six seats in the U.S. Senate while holding the U.S. House. The same share want to see Democrats lead Congress — a far less likely possibility. The final third? They say it just doesn't matter who takes control of Congress. Overall, just 13 percent of Americans approve of the way Congress overall is handling its job."" [AP] 'The summer of our discontent' - Mark Murray: ""Two words sum up the mood of the nation: Fed up. Six in 10 Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the U.S. economy, more than 70 percent believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and nearly 80 percent are down on the country’s political system, according to the latest NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll. The frustration carries over to the nation’s political leaders, with President Barack Obama’s overall approval rating hitting a new low at 40 percent, and a mere 14 percent of the public giving Congress a thumbs up. 'We’re in the summer of our discontent,' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. 'Americans are cranky, unhappy… It is with everything going on the world.' Yet because this discontent differs – among Democrats, Republicans, and independents – Hart cautions that Americans still aren't likely to be storming the polls on Election Day in November."" [NBC] Not much of a change for president or Congress - The phrase ""record low"" may obscure the fact that NBC/WSJ (along with our polling average) finds the president's ratings still mired roughly where they've been all year. Obama's 40 percent rating is down just 1 point from NBC/WSJ's June poll, and just below from the 41-to-44 percent range he's fluctuated in this year, while Congress' 14 percent approval is nearly identical to their 13 percent rating in January.But pessimism is visibly on the rise - Both new surveys find Americans increasingly convinced that the country is ""on the wrong track"" -- the percentage saying so is up 8 points since June in the NBC/WSJ poll, and up 10 points since May in the AP-GfK survey. That tracks with the Pollster average, which shows negative opinions spiking during last year's government shutdown and quickly leveling off, before beginning to rise again this June. The Pollster model, set to ""less smoothing"" to capture the movement more clearly, puts belief that things are on the wrong track at nearly 68 percent, just a point or two below where it stood at the height of the shutdown. [HuffPost Pollster chart] NEW JERSEYANS WOULDN'T VOTE FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE IN 2016 - Quinnipiac: ""Despite his favorite son status, New Jersey Gov. Christopher Christie trails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 50 - 42 percent in an early look at the 2016 presidential race in the Garden State, measured in a Quinnipiac University Poll released today….New Jersey voters say 55 - 39 percent that Christie would not be a good president. Democrats say no 79 - 16 percent and independent voters agree 55 - 39 percent. Republicans say 72 - 23 percent that Christie would make a good president. Christie should run for president, 46 percent of voters say, while 49 percent say he should stay home."" [Quinnipiac] KANSAS POLLS CALL THE WINNER IN SENATE PRIMARY, OVERSTATE MARGIN - Kyle Cheney and James Hohmann: ""The Republican establishment’s latest triumph over tea party activists in a Senate primary this year — Pat Roberts’ narrower-than-expected win over challenger Milton Wolf on Tuesday night — came with a big lift from party headquarters in Washington…Roberts defeated Wolf, 48 percent to 41 percent; a pair of minor candidates combined for the remaining 11 percent of the vote….Roberts’ margin was narrower than expected. Recent polls had showed him crushing Wolf, a radiologist who attacked the incumbent from the right."" Polling gave Roberts an average lead of over 15 points, but suggested the race was narrowing. [Politico, Pollster chart] POLLSTER PREDICTS MORE ONLINE SURVEYS ARE INEVITABLE - Reg Baker, a former American Association for Public Opinion Research Executive Council member, and chair of its recent Non-Probability Sampling Task Force: ""Unless you’ve been on vacation the last couple of weeks chances are that you have heard that The New York Times CBS News have begun using the YouGov online panel in the models they use to forecast US election results, part of a change in their longstanding policy of using only data from probability-based samples in their news stories. On Friday, the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) issued a statement essentially condemning the Times (and its polling partner, CBS News) for 'rushing to embrace new approaches without an adequate understanding of the limits of these nascent methodologies' and for a lack of 'a strong framework of transparency, full disclosure, and explicit standards.'...The use of non-probability online panels in electoral polling is hardly 'new' or 'nascent.' We have well over a decade of experience showing that with appropriate adjustments these polls are just as reliable as those relying on probability sampling, which also require adjustment….My own belief is that this is the first shoe to drop. Others are sure to follow. And, I expect, deep down most AAPORites know it. AAPOR is powerless to stop it and I wish they would cease trying….to use a political metaphor, AAPOR has positioned itself on the wrong side of history. Rather than deny the future, I wish they would focus on helping their members, along with the rest of us, transition to it.""

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3118e240000310055be89.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yesterday afternoon the Wall Street Journal's MarketWatch reported the news: ""Walgreen's Stock Tumbles on Report It Won't Invert."" Citing unnamed sources (and Sky News), the bulletin reported that Walgreen's has decided not to ""invert"" the company's nationality to become a Swiss company, and thus lower its U.S. tax bill as it completes its takeover of the pharmacy chain, Alliance Boots.This news represents a victory for a powerful alliance of citizen action groups, united under the banner of Americans for Tax Fairness, who have been sending a strong message to Walgreen's that, if the company did not renounce plans to abandon the U.S., Americans would abandon Walgreen's stores.  And it represents a victory for President Obama, who had recently called on companies like Walgreen's to reject using the inversion loophole to change nationality while continuing to operate in the U.S. He declared in July that ""I don't care if it's legal, it's wrong."" And it is a victory for Members of Congress, like Senators Levin, Durbin and Warren (See her video here.), who are still pursuing legislation that would make it illegal for large corporations to use the inversion option.Over the last few weeks, the Campaign for America's Future has joined other groups in the Americans for Tax Fairness coalition to criticize the stampede of U.S. corporations using inversion to escape taxes -- and we have focused pressure on Walgreen's as that company publicly considered taking the inversion route, which would have saved them $4 billion over five years by becoming -- on paper -- a Swiss company, according to a report by ATF and Change to Win.Many groups used different language to encourage supporters to sign the same message. We led our online campaign with a blunt warning: Tell Walgreens: If you leave the U.S., we will leave your stores.Walgreens used to be a U.S. company that grew by competing on price and service.The petition used by all groups was the same: Tell Walgreens: Don't Desert America.This has been one of those times when irresponsible corporate acts have spurred us to rapid and coordinated action. As I write this, 300,000 Americans have signed the tough message to to Walgreens CEO Greg Wasson. That statement, still gaining signatures all over the Internet, has been circulated in a team effort by these activist groups:American Family Voices Americans for Tax Fairness Campaign for America's Future Daily Kos Demand Progress/Watchdog.net Democracy for America National People's Action Progressive Congress Progressives United Roots Action The Other 98% USAction While savoring the power of our victory, all of these groups understand that we can't depend on pressuring corporations to make the ""patriotic"" decision to keep paying U.S. taxes to sustain the roads, police, schools, military, courts and the rest of the things that corporate manufacturing, distribution and sales depend on. In fact, as conservatives have been telling us since the wave of inversions began, we can't expect corporations to be ""moral"" or ""patriotic."" If we write the rules that let them get away with immoral and unpatriotic betrayal of U.S. taxpayers, they will do it. So the next order of business is to get Congress to pass legislation.Some Members of Congress blandly assure us that, ""sometime after the 2014"" elections, they will pass ""comprehensive corporate tax reform"" that will fix this epidemic of companies changing their national identities and escaping U.S. taxes. But many of these law-makers, already lining their re-election coffers with corporate money, don't tell us that they plan to lower corporate tax rates so low as to bribe big companies into staying in the U.S.We've got to tell Members of Congress that we can't afford to wait. We want them to fight for immediate legislation that would eliminate legal provisions that allow and encourage companies to become ""foreign"" companies, while continuing to benefit from our market, infrastructure, and tax incentives. And if legislation doesn't pass before the November, we need to target law-makers who are standing in the way.However, three Senators trying to pass S. 2360, the Stop Corporate Inversions Act, are now urgently warning that, despite our victory with Walgreen's, the continuing ""flood of corporate inversions justifies immediate executive action"" by the president. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have sent a letter to President Obama urging him to use his executive authority to reduce or eliminate tax breaks for companies that shift their headquarters overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes. In their letter they declared:Corporations that renounce their U.S. corporate citizenship should not be able to reap all the benefits that American tax dollars provide. We urge you to use your authority to stand up for American companies which are proud to be part of our nation and reduce U.S. incentives for others corporations which would abandon their responsibilities to their country for a nod of approval from Wall Street.The groups that led the fight with Walgreens should feel good about the power we were able to mobilize. We should be encouraged by a new poll released yesterday that shows the American people are overwhelmingly with us in disapproving of corporate inversions. This shows we can make corporate tax evasion a major issue in winning a Congress that will achieve real reform.But if we decide to lead, we had better figure out a way to produce results. Partial reform won't change the system or the players. It is absolutely clear that US corporations will exploit any loophole and use any scheme to hide corporate profits and avoid US taxes - to the extreme of abandoning our country.So while we fight the immediate fight, let's consider ways to reform US corporate taxes in a way that 1) raises the revenue America needs, 2) treats U.S. corporations just like foreign multinationals - so they are not incentivized to leave the country. And 3) let's build support for a system that is simple enough that all corporations doing business in the U.S. must pay their fair share, no matter where there headquarters is located.  A new corporate tax plan from economist Michael Udell would not only stop inversions, but it would also accomplish all three of the big goals above. I urge you to read Dave Johnson's explanation and the LA Times' editorial embracing the Udell plan. And then let's all start talking about a tax system that will work for America -- one that takes into account that all corporations pursue their own interests - and therefore we have to pursue our interests as a nation.But first, let's take a victory lap. We got a major (US) corporation to stay a (U.S.) corporation for tax purposes -- at least for now. And that is a big American victory."

RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae9f3a2200005700db0110.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Obama drew attention earlier this summer for reportedly describing his policy doctrine to reporters with four simple words: ""don't do stupid shit."" With the revelation this week of yet another sloppy USAID-backed scheme in Cuba, it's time to see how serious the president is about adhering to this principle.The investigative report by the Associated Press, only a few months after an exposé of the embarrassing ZunZuneo (aka ""Cuban Twitter"") boondoggle, revealed that the U.S., in a program ""fraught with incompetence and risk,"" had been sending young Latin American workers undercover to Cuba in hopes of ""ginning up rebellion"" in the communist Island.The program was reckless and dangerous on multiple levels. According to documents obtained by the AP, workers used an HIV-prevention workshop for Cubans as cover, calling it the ""perfect excuse"" for their mission. Using health programs as cover for political change can have unintended and deadly consequences, as we're now seeing in other parts of the world. Already, aid groups like InterAction have blasted the program as ""unacceptable"" for sacrificing health services ""to advance an intelligence goal."" And they're right. Programs like these breach a trust with the very people we're trying to help. Whether it's promoting what should be universally welcomed initiatives like HIV prevention or providing Cubans with access to basic communications tools, we only impede our own goals by tying them to regime change policies like the Helms-Burton Act.USAID's latest bungled program, much like the one that sent jailed U.S. contractor Alan Gross to Cuba, also showed a stunning disregard for the well-being of those it employed. Like Gross, the workers reportedly received little training on how to avoid detection by Cuban officials, with no apparent plan in the event of capture or arrest. And despite the fact the contractor responsible for the program, Creative Associates, has received hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts, the workers in question allegedly received pay as low as $5.41 an hour. As Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont put it, ""It may have been good business for USAID's contractor, but it tarnishes USAID's long track record as a leader in global health.""  Yet despite achieving nothing, and increasing risk to health workers around the world, we shouldn't be surprised to see the usual pro-embargo crowd praising this as another fine moment in U.S.-Cuba policy. To defenders of the status quo, the fact that these programs exist - no matter how profoundly lousy they may be - is enough to give them the warm and fuzzies.The rest of us should not be as content with mediocrity. Helms-Burton continues to produce convoluted, expensive, and potentially dangerous schemes incapable of replacing actual diplomacy. The president should steer our Cuba policy away from wasteful government programs and immediately move to allow all American travel to the island, support its burgeoning private sector, and empower individuals, not government bureaucrats, to serve as catalysts for meaningful change. To date, these programs have only served to give the Cuban regime a scapegoat to justify their denial of basic human rights, and continue to undermine our efforts to bring an increasingly ill Alan Gross home to his family. If President Obama is serious about cutting out the stupid stuff, then an overhaul of our current approach towards Cuba is long overdue.Ricardo Herrero is the Executive Director of #CubaNow, www.cubanow.us (on Twitter @Cuba_Now).

But this is the music industry, so we know it took a little more than fate to bring her and Beyonce together for this weekend's pioneering collaboration.During an interview on Hot 97, Minaj revealed how the song came to be. G. Roberson, founder of management firm Hip Hop Since 1978, approached Minaj ""a month or two ago"" to say Beyonce would like her to remix ""Flawless."" Given how busy both ladies are, it's not an unfair assumption that they might have fashioned the remix without ever setting foot in the same room, but Minaj says that wasn't the case:""After I got proper medical help and started breathing again, I was like, 'What?' She sent me a version that she wanted. She told me, 'I want you to be you. I don't want you to hold back."" I said, 'You sure?' She said, 'Yeah. I want you to just be you and do you.' I was actually in New York writing the verse. I recorded the verse in New York and she stopped by the studio. She was such a sweetheart. She was hyping me up, like, 'Yeah, do your thing. Don't hold back. Go in.' And I said, 'Okay, all right.'"" Minaj says Beyonce told her the track would premiere during the course of the On the Run tour, and indeed it did. Fans woke up Sunday morning to the news that the reigning queens of hip-hop and R&B had joined forces. ""When I was putting out mix tapes and stuff, I would always remix her stuff,"" Minaj said. ""I have a dope remix that my fans have always been in love with, to one of her songs, 'Sweet Dreams,' [that] me and Wayne did,"" said Minaj.""I figured that eventually we would do something together. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. Recently I thought it would never happen 'cause I felt like if she was going to ask me, she would have been asked me. I think the stars aligned the right way. We are just in the right places in our careers that it makes sense now. I feel like, with the release to her last album, her records are geared to what I do now, and so it is what it is.""What Minaj does now is promote ""Anaconda,"" her newest single, which samples Six Mir-A-Lot's ""Baby Got Back."" Maybe Beyonce can join her for the remix."

Internationally, there is the dangerous nationalism and ambition for empire-rebuilding being carried out by Vladimir Putin, in ways both coherent and incoherent. Even more frightening -- because we understand it even less well -- are religious zealots and their state sponsors running amok across the Middle East. Meanwhile on the domestic front, extreme elements of one of our two principal national parties have caused dysfunction and the near-breakdown of our polity at a time of unique and pressing challenges: health care, immigration, and the nation's basic infrastructure, to name just three. On top of all this, the emergence of Ebola is a pile-on that, while hardly man-made, appears as a metaphor for a world that seems to have gone mad.Against this backdrop stands the former secretary's book and, with August's arrival (and, if we are lucky, a quieter month of introspection and actual book reading), the chance to assess the strengths of extreme competence and steady-as-she goes perseverance that the author brings to once, and perhaps future, national challenges. Here's what you need to know about Hard Choices, including some tips on how to address this worthy tome.First of all, this reviewer discovered that the book is a much more interesting read than expected. While there is plenty here for policy wonks, there are also gripping tales that have the quality of a page-turner. The lead-up to Osama Bin Laden's death in Pakistan, the rescue of Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng in Beijing, that famous first flight from Malta into Tripoli, Libya (immortalized by a Hillary-as-commando meme that went viral), the president and secretary literally crashing a private meeting of dissenting world leaders at the 2009 climate change conference in Copenhagen -- these are all here.But beyond these events, I was impressed by how very accessible this book is. Clinton's prose is simple and matter-of-fact, with complex issues explained in (mostly) plain language. While many Beltway-insiders may roll their eyes at facts and policy arguments they already know by heart, this book wasn't written only for them; rather it was written for Jane Q. Citizen, who reads to learn of recent history, and perhaps to gain insights into a future that may yet be. What Jane Q. will also find in Hard Choices are lesser known, but no less fascinating, foreign policy efforts and events that make equally riveting reading -- like the secret U.S. effort to negotiate peace with the Taliban, the secretary's heart-rending visit with women and children in Eastern Congo, and the extraordinary tale told to her by President Putin about how he came to be born(!)On the ""wonk"" side there are real serious, cogent explanations of things you may not have quite understood before. This is an evidence-based book, so facts and statistics often come fast: like the fact that the United States spends less than 1 percent of its annual budget on foreign assistance (rather than the ""28 percent"" that resides in the popular imagination) or that ""Secretary of State"" is the addressee on each and every one of the millions of cables that come in to Washington from over 270 U.S. embassies and consulates around the world every year -- and that only a tiny, tiny fraction of these ever reach the secretary's own desk (therefore debunking the misinformation spread by political opponents that the secretary was directly apprised of the Libyan security situation, pre-Benghazi). Among many other subjects, Clinton explains the pragmatism that lay behind the Russian ""reset"" and, in detail, why the reset did not mean capitulation -- far from it. While it's notable that Clinton abstains from using this book to settle old scores, she includes careful explanations of events and decisions small and large that may have caused head-scratching -- or outright dissent -- at the time they happened. For example, instead of squarely laying at least some responsibility for Benghazi's inadequate security at Congress' doorstep, Clinton merely alludes rather softly to her ""four years making the case to Congress that adequately funding our diplomats and development experts was a national security priority"" at a time of shrinking Congressional appropriations.Clinton also acknowledges her mistake -- in the plainest language possible -- on the subject of her 2002 vote authorizing President Bush to wage war in Iraq, yet also lets us fully understand the context of that vote: one in which a strong majority of then-sitting senators voted ""yes"" with Clinton on a bill that, by its terms, instructed the president (not yet known, in 2002, for waging preemptive wars) to 'use diplomacy before using force' and 'not to wage war unless U.S. national security is at stake.' Perhaps most importantly for this book, there is heart, soul and emotion. Clinton saves some of the most expansive, lofty language for her worldwide, and life-spanning, efforts on behalf of women and girls, and this reviewer was especially heartened by all the space she devotes to perhaps the final frontier of international human rights: the plight of LGBT people in the developing world, starting with her description of the first time she uttered the words, at a State Department Pride event, ""human rights are gay rights and gay rights are human rights, once and for all."" A couple of parting tips on how to read Hard Choices, especially if you find its telephone book size to be daunting: you don't have to read it cover to cover. The book is organized like a marvelous worldwide travelogue, so while I highly recommend that you begin by reading ""Part One: A Fresh Start"" (which contains its own share of riveting stories of the Obama-Clinton 2008 rapprochement that are new or newly told), proceed from there by dipping into the parts of the world -- or towards the end, the international challenges -- that tickle your fancy, and come back to the rest later on. And, oh yes, about that last question you have for Hillary Clinton: will she run for president? Many have quoted the following language from the book's last chapter as a sign that she will: ""Never rest on your laurels. Never quit. Never stop working to make the world a better place. That's our unfinished business.""But I prefer the following, from the epilogue: In the coming years, Americans will have to decide whether we are prepared to learn from and call on the lessons of history and rise once more to defend our values and interests. This is not a summons to confrontation or to a new Cold War -- we've learned painfully that force should be our last resort, never our first. Instead, it's an appeal to stand firmly and united in pursuit of a more just, free and peaceful world. Only Americans can decide this.Clinton then continues by devoting a long paragraph to America's domestic challenges, including rising income inequality, deepening poverty in many quarters, and Washington's increasing dysfunction. And finally, this: ""In the end, our strength abroad depends on our resolve and resilience at home.""   July was a month when at least four separate wars raged across the Middle East and South Asia, an American Embassy was evacuated in North Africa, and a commercial airliner was shot out of the sky over Ukraine -- the deadliest such incident in history. Unfortunately, we can expect to look forward to more rather than fewer months like July. To battle feckless extremism wherever it arises, we need feral competence and discipline and perseverance at our helm. Whether by accident or by design, Hard Choices doggedly makes the case for the person to lead us who is best placed to deliver more democracy, more freedom and more peacefulness the world over -- and it doesn't hurt that this person has the biggest, most diverse rolodex on the planet."
