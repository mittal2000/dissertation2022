Okavango DeltaWith annual flooding between June and August, this astounding delta is formed as the Okavango River meets with the basin of Botswana's Kalahari - the water eventually evaporating or draining into the surrounding areas. As the delta fills up during what are the driest months across the rest of Botswana, animals from far and wide congregate in the area, resulting in one of the greatest concentrations of wildlife in Africa. As well as being made the 1000th UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Okavango Delta has justifiably been named one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa. Careful conservation of the habitat means that there are only a select few lodges and camps to stay at, from where you can explore the delta's waterways while seeking out creatures both large and small.KENYA2. The Kenyan Lake System of the Great Rift ValleyIn the Great Rift Valley that stretches across Kenya, the three lakes Bogoria, Nakuru and Elementaita, make up Kenya's lake system, covering an area of over 32,000 hectares. This area of outstanding beauty is an important habitat for birdlife, with many endangered species among the abundance of birdlife that's known as one of the world's most diverse populations. The lakes are perhaps best known for their flocks of pink flamingoes, as the number one site worldwide for foraging lesser flamingoes, but they are also a nesting and breeding site for great white pelicans, and mammals like black rhino, Rothschild's giraffe and lions roam the land. Stay at a safari lodge to explore the volcanic land and experience its diversity of both birdlife and mammals.NAMIBIA3. Namib Sand SeaThis immense coastal fog desert in Namibia encompasses large shifting sand dunes, covering over three million hectares of the Namib-Naukluft Park. The harsh environment's many endemic plant and animal species are fascinating proof of the natural world's ability to evolve and adapt to extreme conditions. See oryx, zebra and desert giraffe, as well as smaller animals like meerkats. The Namibrand Reserve, within the Namib Sand Sea, is an ideal area to base yourself, with sand dunes, canyons and savanna to explore. Flying safaris are a popular way to experience Namibia's desert too, enabling you to travel across the vast expanse of land and see the spectacular golden sand dunes from above.SOUTH AFRICA4. Cape Floristic RegionNear the southern tip of South Africa, this region around the eastern and western Capes is one of just six designated floral kingdoms worldwide, due to its incredible diversity of flowering plant species - some of which are endemic - that make up 20 percent of all of Africa's flora. Officially recognised as a biodiversity hotspot, the UNESCO World Heritage Site includes eight nature reserves and wilderness areas, with Table Mountain National Park among them. Base yourself in Cape Town for exploration of the coastal region, and if you go in Spring - from August to mid-October - you'll see areas that are carpeted in flowers.TANZANIA5. Kilimanjaro National ParkMount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania is Africa's highest peak at 5,895 metres, while the surrounding savanna and forest of the national park stretch across a staggering 75,575 hectares, creating a striking contrast between the snow-capped peak and African plains. Such a unique landscape affords unique zones of vegetation, which along with its population of endangered species has given the national park its global status. Take on the challenge of summiting Mount Kilimanjaro and trek through each of the environmental zones it encompasses. January, February and September are the optimum times to go, with warmer and drier days than the rest of the year.6. Ngorongoro Conservation AreaAs another of Africa's Seven Natural Wonders, Ngorongoro Conservation Area is a vast volcanic caldera in the crater highlands, west of Arusha. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is protected with both its landscape and wildlife in mind, while also taking into account the indigenous Maasai community. Montane forest, grassland and bushland, as well as the Magadi salt lake and Ngoitokitok Spring, are home to black rhino, hippopotamus, wildebeest and zebra, and a healthy population of lions. Stay at a lodge in Ngorongoro Crater to discover the region for yourself.7. Serengeti National ParkThis vast expanse of land is the setting for Africa's Great Migration, a natural phenomenon in which the wildlife population moves through the land with the seasons - named another of Africa's Seven Wonders. Serengeti National Park crosses over between the Mara and Simiyu regions with a habitat of grassland, woodland, riverine forest, swamps and kopjes, and great numbers of wildebeest, gazelles, zebra and buffalo, plus a remarkably large population of lions. In fact, the national park originates from a game reserve that was established to protect its lion population.Visit the north or south Serengeti to witness the annual migration.THE SEYCHELLES8. Aldabra AtollAs the world's largest coral atoll, Aldabra consists of four large coral islands and a lagoon, surrounded by coral reef. And, in its remote location amongst the Seychelles' outer islands, the atoll is uninhabited, remaining incredibly untouched to this day. The coral islands have become known across the globe for having as many as 100,000 giant tortoises, making it the world's largest population of these creatures. Plus, large seabird colonies and the world's largest arthropod, the coconut crab, add to the atoll's natural importance. Visitor numbers are strictly controlled, so permission needs to be obtained before arranging a boat charter out to the atoll.UGANDA9. Bwindi Impenetrable National ParkStretching across 331 square kilometres of jungle, montane and lowland forest, this national park in Uganda is an extraordinary section of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, on the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The national park is most famous for its population of endangered mountain gorillas - with half of the world's mountain gorilla population - but the area has an abundance of other species and is recognised as one of the richest ecosystems in Africa. As many as 120 mammal species, 348 types of birds and 220 butterflies are among the fauna of more than 1000 flowering plant species, 163 tree species and over 100 different ferns. Base yourself at one of the forest's lodges or camps to trek through this wildlife-rich environment, before coming face-to-face with the gorillas.ZAMBIA / ZIMBABWE10. Mosi-oa-Tunya / Victoria FallsAs the two-kilometre wide Zambezi River tumbles down a series of gorges, thundering into the waters below, the spectacular falls send up spray and mist that can be seen from as far as 30 kilometres away. Gorges and islands around the falls are an important breeding site for endangered bird species too, but the UNESCO World Heritage Site also comprises the 3,779 hectares of Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, 2,340 hectares of Victoria Falls National Park and 741 hectares of Zambezi National Park where herds of elephants can be seen. See Victoria Falls and explore the surrounding national parks by staying at one of the nearby lodges.ZIMBABWE11. Mana Pools National ParkIn northern Zimbabwe, this area of islands, sandbars, pools and forest - named Mana, meaning four, after the four permanent pools there - lies on the banks of the lower Zambezi River where floodplain turns into a series of lakes after the rainy season has come to an end. With the dry season, wildlife is drawn to these lakes, so as well as the park's population of hippos and crocodiles, elephant and buffalo are often seen. While on safari in Mana Pools National Park, explore the scrubland on foot or navigate the pools by canoe. "

3,WORLDPOST,Can Political Islam Co-Exist With Liberal Democracy?,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/political-islam-democracy_n_6903328.html,,2015-03-21,"The Jordanian security surrounds the demonstration of the Muslim Brotherhood in downtown Amman, Jordan, Jordan, Friday, Nov. 28, 2014 in solidarity with Palestinians people and against last week's arrest of deputy leader of the Muslim Brotherhood Zaki Bani Irsheid.(AP Photo/Raad Adayleh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc147ae2400003600382a8c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Shadi Hamid on the current state of political Islam.The fall of dictatorships across the Middle East and North Africa during the Arab Spring protests in 2011 paved the way for Islamist parties to join governments across the Middle East and North Africa. After decades of repression by authoritarian governments, political Islam was able to significantly expand in countries like Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco. In many places, however, the Islamist parties' rise was short lived. In Egypt, the rule of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi was followed by a ruthless crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood. In Tunisia, the Islamist Ennahda party lost the most recent elections. Support for Islamist parties has not completely disappeared, however, even as the Brotherhood has been outlawed and other parties lost power. The WorldPost spoke with Dr. Shadi Hamid about the state of political Islam today. Hamid is a Brookings Institute Fellow and the author of Temptations of Power, a book on Islamist movements. In the wake of the so called Arab Spring protests, Islamist parties swept to power in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Now, with a few exceptions, that power has dissipated. What happened to those parties?At the most basic level, Islamist parties were simply unprepared for the Arab Spring and what came with it. We have to remember that this really did come as a surprise to the actors themselves, who weren’t really planning for anything resembling revolution. It was impossible to imagine that scenario.For Islamists in particular, it brought to the fore a lot of challenging and unanswered questions about the tension between absolute religious ideas and the mundane realities of everyday politics. Islamists have to appeal to different audiences, and it’s a very delicate balance because these different constituencies want very different things. Democracy is nice in theory, but it’s a little more difficult to swallow for many different Arab constituencies in practice.Democracy is nice in theory, but in practice it’s a little more difficult to swallow for many different Arab constituencies.More broadly, there's also a foundational divide in the Middle East over religion and the meaning and nature of the nation-state. That divide is difficult to resolve. Is that foundational divide based on different conceptions of the nation-state or does it have it more to do with concepts of identity?The two are intertwined. Mainstream Islamists have largely reconciled themselves to the Westphalian order. You can be okay with the nation-state but disagree on what the purpose of the nation-state is. Should the state be ideologically or religiously neutral or should it be entrusted with promoting a certain conception of the Good? Even in a country that has had decades of democratic experience like Turkey, that is a debate that is really returning to the fore.Turkey is one of the countries where Islamists are in power. There's been concern over the country's perceived movement towards illiberal democracy.Turkey is fascinating in this regard because we do see a very noticeable shift. The ruling AK party of 2004 is not the AK party of today and we have to ask what happened in between. Part of this is that the AK party was very constrained when they came to power. They were worried about a military coup and therefore were very careful about how they talked about religion and avoided crossing certain red lines.I think it’s important to understand that Islamists are Islamists for a reasonOnce the military was sidelined and the judiciary was neutralized, the AK party realized correctly that it now had more space to operate without fearing a backlash. It’s natural for any party to reflect its ideological preferences, and they saw an opportunity and wanted to seize it. It's important to understand that Islamists are Islamists for a reason, and to expect them to disavow the entirety of who they are is unrealistic and doesn’t make sense from a pure electoral standpoint. Many people like Islamists precisely because they’re Islamists.How is political Islam today grappling with the dilemma of literalist interpretations of Islam conflicting with concerns of the state?I think the subtext in so many debates over the past few months about ISIS or Charlie Hebdo is that there’s a kind of impatience, anger and frustration with Muslims for not getting on board with liberal democracy. In a lot of these debates, people are asking Muslims to come to terms with liberal democracy and go through a reformation. I think for a variety of reasons there has to be a kind of understanding that there may be peoples or societies that aren’t comfortable working within the confines of liberal democracy, and want to try out a new ideological project. There has to be a realistic understanding that there’s going to be a type of religious illiberalism in that move towards democracy in the region.The question is -- and this is a difficult one for Western liberals -- should Egyptians, Jordanians or whoever else be able to decide through the democratic process that they want to try out a different approach to religion, law and governance? That’s been a strong debate about how the ideals of liberal democracy confront and sometimes clash with political Islam.Yes, and one of the lessons of the Arab Spring period is that the existing state system had either been unwilling or unable to accommodate Islamist political participation. I think this is one of the legacies of the last few years, that there hasn’t been a successful case of fully incorporating Islamists in a way that doesn’t threaten the integrity of a democratic transition. Tunisia is one relative bright spot but we don’t know yet, because Islamists are not currently in power and when they were in power they were effectively forced to step down. Groups like ISIS have been able to strengthen their narrative by being able to point at these experiments in Islamist democratic participation and argue that that project failed and the only way to achieve an Islamic state is through brute force.There hasn’t been a successful case of fully incorporating Islamists in a way that doesn’t threaten the integrity of a democratic transition.That message has become unfortunately more attractive. What I worry about going forward is that if various governments insist on excluding Islamists from the democratic process, then the narrative of groups like ISIS will have more appeal.What are some of the barriers to a form of political pluralism that would incorporate some political Islam into states that desire it?We’re talking about challenging long-standing political orders with their own long-standing political elites and that’s very threatening, since we don’t know what that looks like in practice. There aren’t really models to emulate. Turkey was the one example of Islamists coming to power through democratic means and governing for long enough to be able to assess their performance, but the Turkish example has contributed to the fears of Islamist consolidation of power. It gets back to this issue that there’s a fear Islamists will change the nature of the state once they have enough power and use it to promote a different conception of what it means to be a good citizen -- that religion will become infused in daily politics in a way that hasn’t been before. Islamists are interested in Islamizing society to one degree or another, and that Islamization will continue to provoke fears down the road.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series: "

7,HEALTHY LIVING,17 Surprising Reasons You're Stressed Out,Sarah Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/surprising-stress-causes_n_6849250.html,,2015-03-21,Close-up of a businesswoman suffering from a headache in an office,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e9c3b1f00005000221515.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," By Amanda MacMillanYou're probably all too aware of the major sources of stress in your life -- money, your terrible commute, the construction workers who start jackhammering at 5 a.m. But stress and anxiety don't have to just come from obvious or even negative sources. ""There are plenty of chronic strains and low-grade challenges that don't necessarily overwhelm you in the moment, but almost take more of a toll in the long run,"" says Scott Schieman, Ph.D., professor of sociology at the University of Toronto. These are some of unexpected reasons why you might feel anxious or agitated. By recognizing them for what they are, says Schieman, you can better prepare to cope.1. Your Significant Other Even if you have a blissfully happy relationship with your live-in partner or spouse, you're both bound to do things that get on each other's nerves. ""Early in the relationship, it's usually about space and habits -- like whether you squeeze the toothpaste from the middle or the bottom of the tube,"" says Ken Yeager, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. ""Later on, you might clash over parenting style or financial issues, and finding a unified front to face these issues together."" So what's the key to surviving and thriving in your life together? Finding balance, says Yeager: spending the right amount of time together (not too much and not too little), making compromises, keeping communication open and honest, and remembering to acknowledge what you love about each other on a daily basis.2. Everyday Annoyances We're told not to sweat the small stuff, but sometimes it's the little things that have the biggest impact on our mood: the never-ending phone calls with your insurance company, the rude cashier at the grocery store, the 20 minutes you lose looking for a parking space. ""We let these things bother us because they trigger unconscious fears,"" says Yeager -- fears of being seen as irresponsible, of being bullied or embarrassed, or of being late all the time, for example. ""Sometimes you need to take a step back and realize that you're doing the best you can given the circumstances."" 3. Other People's Stress Stress is contagious, according to a 2014 German study: In a series of experiments, most participants who simply observed others completing a stressful task experienced an increase themselves in production of the stress hormone cortisol -- a phenomenon known as empathic stress. You can also experience stress when someone you know is affected by a traumatic event, like a car crash or a chronic illness. ""You start to worry, 'Oh my gosh, could that happen to me?',"" says Yeager. ""We tend not to think about these things until they hit close to home.""4. Social Media  It may seem like Facebook is the only way you keep up with the friends you don't see regularly -- which, during particularly busy times, can be just about all of them. The social network also has a downside, according to a 2015 study from the Pew Research Center: It can make you aware of stressful situations in your friends' lives, which in turn can add more stress to your life. The Pew report didn't find that social media users, overall, had higher levels of stress, but previous studies have suggested that frequent social-media use can be associated with negative body image and prolonged breakup pain.5. Distraction A distraction can be a good thing then when it takes your mind off of a stressful situation or difficult decision, like when you take a break from work to meet a friend for lunch. But it works the other way, as well: When you're so busy thinking about something else that you can't enjoy what's going on around you, that kind of distraction can be a recipe for stress. Practicing mindfulness gives you brain the refresh it needs, says Richard Lenox, director of the Student Counseling Center at Texas Tech University. Paying full attention to your surroundings when you're walking and driving can help, he adds. ""Stress and anxiety tend to melt away when our mind is focused on the present."" 6. Your Childhood Traumatic events that happened when you were a kid can continue to affect your stress levels and overall health into adulthood. A 2014 University of Wisconsin-Madison study found that these childhood experiences may actually change parts of the brain responsible for processing stress and emotion. The way you were raised can also have a lasting impact on your everyday angst, suggests a 2014 Johns Hopkins University study. Researchers found that children of parents with social anxiety disorders are more likely to develop ""trickle-down anxiety"" -- not simply because of their genes, but because of their parents' behaviors toward them such as a lack of warmth and emotion, or high levels of criticism and doubt.7. Tea And Chocolate You probably know to take it easy on the coffee when you're already feeling on edge. ""Caffeine is always going to make stress worse,"" says Yeager. But you may not think as much about drinking several cups of tea at once, or chowing down on a bar of dark chocolate -- both of which can contain nearly as much caffeine as a cup of joe. ""Chocolate is a huge caffeine source,"" says Yeager. ""I know people who don't drink coffee but they'll eat six little candy bars in a two-hour period because they want the same kind of jolt."" Too much caffeine, in any form, can cause problems with sleep, digestion, and irritability. 8. Your Expectations  When things don't go the way you've planned, do you tend to get upset and act defensively, or do you roll with the punches and set off on a new plan? If it's the former, you could be contributing to a mindset of pessimism and victimization that will slowly wear you down, even when things may not be as bad as they seem. ""Your level of serenity is inversely proportionate to your expectations,"" says Yeager. That doesn't mean you shouldn't set ambitious goals for yourself or settle for less than what you want, of course, but being realistic about what's truly possible is important, as well.9. Your Reaction To Stress If you tend to deal with stressful situations by working long hours, skipping your workouts, and bingeing on junk food, we've got some bad news: You're only making it worse. ""We know that physical activity and healthy foods will help your body better deal with stress, and yet we often avoid them when we need them the most,"" says Yeager. ""People really need to think about this downward spiral we get into and work harder to counteract it.""10. Multitasking Think you're being super efficient by tackling four tasks at once? Chances are you're not -- and it's only decreasing your productivity while increasing your stress. A 2012 University of Irvine study, for example, found that people who responded to emails all day long while also trying to get their work done experienced more heart-rate variability (an indicator of mental stress) than those who waited to respond to all of their emails at one time. Focusing on one task at a time can ensure that you're doing that job to the best of your abilities and getting the most out of it, so you won't have to worry about or go back and fix it later, says Schieman. And don't worry: You'll have enough time to do it all. In fact, you may discover you have more time than you thought.11. Your Favorite Sport Watching a tight game of college hoops can stress you out -- even if your alma mater wins. ""The body doesn't distinguish between 'bad' stress from life or work and 'good' stress caused by game-day excitement,"" says Jody Gilchrist, a nurse practitioner at the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Heart and Vascular Clinic. Watching sports can even trigger the body's sympathetic nervous system, releasing adrenaline and reducing blood flow to the heart. Those temporary consequences aren't usually anything to be concerned about, but over time, chronic stress can lead to high blood pressure and increased disease risk. And, of course, it doesn't help if you're adding alcohol and binge-eating to a situation that's already stressful on your body. You may not be able to control the outcome of the game, says Gilchrist, but you can limit its effects on your own body. 12. Digital Devices  Whether you're using it for work or play, technology may play a large role in your mental health, says Yeager. Using computers or e-readers too close to bedtime could lead to sleep problems, he says, and spending too much time virtually socializing can make real-life interactions seem extra stressful. (Plus, texting doesn't trigger the same feel-good hormones as face-to-face talk does.) Then there's the dreaded ""work creep,"" says Schieman, when smartphones allow employees to be tethered to their jobs, even during off-hours. ""People say they're only going to check email for an hour while they're on vacation, but the problem with email is that they're filled with responsibilities, new tasks, and dilemmas that are going to be hard to compartmentalize and put out of your head once that hour is up.""13. Your (Good) Health While it may not be as stressful as having a chronic illness or getting bad news at the doctor's office, even people in the best shape of their lives worry about their bodies, their diets, and their fitness levels. In fact, people who take healthy living to an extreme may experience some rather unhealthy side effects. People who follow low-carb diets, for example, are more likely to report being sad or stressed out, while those on any kind of restrictive meal plan may feel more tired than usual. And it's not unheard of for someone to become obsessed with healthy eating (known as orthorexia) or working out (gymorexia). Like any form of perfectionism, these problems can be stressful at best, and extremely dangerous at worst.14. Housework Does folding laundry help you feel calm, or does it make your blood boil? If you're in a living situation where you feel you're responsible for an unfair share of work, even chores you once enjoyed may start to feel like torture. ""Dividing up housework and parenting responsibilities can be tricky, especially if both partners work outside the home,"" says Schieman. ""And whether you define that division of labor as equal or unequal can really change your attitude toward it.""15. Uncertainty Stress can be defined as any perceived or actual threat, says Yeager, so any type of doubt that's looming over you can contribute to your anxiety levels on a daily basis. ""When you know something could change at any minute, you always have your guard up and it's hard to just relax and enjoy anything."" Financial uncertainty may be the most obvious stressor -- not being sure if you'll keep your job during a round of layoffs, or not knowing how you'll pay your credit card bill. Insecurities in other areas of life, like your relationship or your housing status, can eat away at you too.16. Your Pet  No matter how much you love your furry friends, there's no question that they add extra responsibility to your already full plate. Even healthy animals need to be fed, exercised, cleaned up after, and given plenty of attention on a regular basis -- and unhealthy ones can be a whole other story. ""Pets can be the most positive source of unconditional love, but at the same time they require an extreme amount of energy,"" says Yeager. People also tend to underestimate the stress they'll experience when they lose a pet. ""I've had people in my office tell me they cried more when their dog died than when their parent died. It's a very emotional connection.""17. Your Education Having a college degree boosts your odds of landing a well-paying job, so although you're less likely to suffer from money-related anxiety, your education can bring on other types of stress, according to a 2014 study by Schieman and his University of Toronto colleagues. His research found that highly educated people were more likely to be stressed out thanks to job pressures, being overworked, and conflicts between work and family. ""Higher levels of authority come with a lot more interpersonal baggage, such as supervising people or deciding whether they get promotions,"" says Schieman. ""With that type of responsibility, you start to take things like incompetency and people not doing their jobs more personally, and it bothers you more.""More from Health.com: 12 Signs You May Have an Anxiety Disorder Quick Ways to Beat Stress 19 Natural Remedies for Anxiety17 Surprising Reasons You're Stressed Out originally appeared on Health.com"

But its latest initiative, Race Together, which encourages Starbucks baristas to discuss race with customers, is misguided and fraught with challenges that almost ensure that it will fail.In the wake of the Ferguson riots and the rising concern over economic inequality (often divided along racial lines), race is a topic of grave importance to America's future. But given the complexity and sensitivity of the topic, it requires and deserves a deep and thoughtful examination, not a 'feel good' shot of racial caffeine delivered at your neighborhood coffee shop. That, if anything, trivializes the issue and reduces it to a publicity-friendly hashtag but little more. Then there is the fact that Starbucks, of all places, is one of the most impractical forums for such discussions due to its business model. The coffee chain thrives on volume and the rapid service of customers throughout the day. In an environment that hectic, is it reasonably possible for baristas to have anything but a superficial exchange with a customer without causing a massive logjam for every other customer in the store? It's not and that's also why Schultz's plan does a disservice to the topic of race. At best, it will lead to lip service by its baristas to satisfy their CEO's edict since anything else could lead to a big mess.In addition, there is the very real possibility of acrimony and even violence resulting from the discussion of such hot-button topics. Starbucks' baristas and customers are racially diverse, which means that the opinions held by people on the topic of race will also invariably be diverse, and sometimes divisive. Race Together can therefore easily lead to unpredictable consequences and put the safety of both baristas and customers at risk.Finally, as a consumer, I don't mind admitting that when I go to Starbucks for my morning coffee, I want nothing more or less. I certainly don't want a lecture on the heavy subject of race along with my already over-priced cup of joe -- even though I am a person of color. I applaud Schultz for wanting to be socially conscious but that shouldn't include potentially forcing me to engage in a conversation of Starbucks' choosing. By doing so, the company is limiting my freedom of choice to discuss race when I want to, where I want to, and with whom I want to.The point is that if Howard Schultz really wants to promote racial harmony, he should do so personally or find other ways to spread the message. Race Together feels too heavy handed, will be hard to execute, deeply uncomfortable for both employees and customers, and ultimately not productive."

Glyphosate now falls in the second level of concern.The new classification is aimed mainly at industrial use of glyphosate. Its use by home gardeners is not considered a risk. Glyphosate is in the same category of risk as things like anabolic steroids and shift work. The decision was published online Thursday in the journal, Lancet Oncology.According to the French agency, glyphosate is used in more than 750 different herbicide products and its use has been detected in the air during spraying, in water and in food. Experts said there was ""limited evidence"" in humans that the herbicide can cause non-Hodgkins lymphoma and there is convincing evidence that glyphosate can also cause other forms of cancer in rats and mice. IARC's panel said glyphosate has been found in the blood and urine of agricultural workers, showing the chemical has been absorbed by the body.Monsanto and other producers of glyphosate-containing herbicides, strongly disagreed with the decision. ""All labeled uses of glyphosate are safe for human health,"" said Monsanto's Phil Miller, global head of regulatory and government affairs, in a statement.The EPA's 2012 assessment of glyphosate concluded that it met the statutory safety standards and that the chemical could ""continue to be used without unreasonable risks to people or the environment.""The French agency's experts said the cancer risks of the weed killer were mostly from occupational exposure.""I don't think home use is the issue,"" said Kate Guyton of IARC.

I already miss the game deeply, but I’m also really excited to learn to do something else,"" Nash wrote in a post published Saturday on The Players' Tribune titled ""Life After Basketball."" Nash didn't see the court this year with the Lakers, sidelined again with injuries. The two-time NBA MVP said in his post that after his 19 years in the NBA, he ""will likely never play basketball again.""Nash, who turned 41 last month, will finish his career as the most accurate free throw shooter in NBA history, according to ESPN, with a 90.4 percentage. He is also the third highest in assists with 10,335 trailing John Stockton and Jason Kidd.Nash's retirement has long been expected as he has struggled with back pain and injuries towards the end of his career. In 2014 Nash himself speculated that with one year left on his contract, this would be his last season. ""I heard someone once say there comes a day when they tell us all that we can’t play anymore. We’re not good enough. Surplus to requirements. Too slow, maybe. When you’re a teenager with outsized dreams and a growing obsession, and someone tells you this ain’t gonna last forever, it’s scary. I never forgot it,"" he wrote. Throughout his essay, Nash thanks the fans and supports and fellow teammates and players from his storied time with both the Phoenix Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers. I remember when Dirk [Nowitzki] and I were nobodies. He used to say over dinner sometimes, “How are us two stiffs gonna make it in this league?” Somehow we made something of ourselves. After all the wins and all the great times we’ve had around the world together, what really means the most to me are the late nights early in our careers when we’d go back to the Landry Center in Dallas, to play a few more games of HORSE and one-on-one. Nash, who said he also had a future in soccer had he focused on the sport, was drafted in the first round of the 1996 NBA Draft by Phoenix.  "

The supermarket was attacked on Friday, January 9th following the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo. Four hostages were killed by terrorist Amedy Coulibaly who was killed by police. Another suspect, Hayat Boumeddiene, escaped and is still wanted in connection with the murder of a policewoman.

ALL TOGETHER is hosted this week by Carol Kuruvilla, Associate Editor of HuffPost Religion. You can download All Together on iTunes, or Stitcher.At weddings, at work, even at Fashion Week, Simone Rodan Benzaquen says there’s one thing Jews in Europe are always willing to discuss: Is it time to leave?Benzaquen is the Paris director of the American Jewish Committee. She was in Paris for the attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and waited in horror to find out what happened to the Jewish people held hostage inside a kosher supermarket two days later. But before the supermarket, there was Toulouse, where a gunman stormed into a Jewish school, killing a rabbi and four young children. And before Toulouse, there were the many other attacks against Jews in France — both verbal and physical. As an advocate for her people, Benzaquen couldn't help keeping a tally.“The situation is incredibly different from the ‘30s. We don’t have state anti-Semitism, very far from it — not only is the government not anti-Semitic, but the contrary,” Benzaquen told HuffPost. “But I imagine that people had the kind of discussions in the ‘30s like that, like, ‘Should we be leaving, should we be staying, is it reasonable to stay, are we responsible parents, all of these kinds of things.” Although they make up just 0.2 percent of the world’s population, or about 14 million people, the number of countries where Jewish people are harassed has reached a seven-year high.According to the Pew Research Center, Jewish people faced religious harassment in about 71 countries in 2012. In 2013, that number jumped to 77.While Christians are more likely to experience governmental restrictions on religion, such as through discriminatory laws, Jews are much more likely to be targeted by individuals or groups.On this week’s ALL TOGETHER, we listen to Benzaquen’s story about what it is like to be a Jewish person in France today. But we don’t stop there — we’re also looking at what can be done. How can we work across religions and across countries to fight anti-Semitism? How do we really combat hate?We’ll hear from Yehezkel Landau, an associate professor of interfaith relations at Hartford Seminary. Landau tells us about the “Open House in Ramle,” a building that is home to both Jewish and Arab families. Ruth Messinger, the president of the American Jewish World Service, also shares stories of interfaith encounters. Her work in the developing world has brought her face to face with people who are very different from her and she’s convinced that it’s these types of meetings that will turn the tide.As Messinger told HuffPost, “The more that people come to know each other and stop seeing any other person as simply a stereotype of this group or that group, the more their understanding grows and the greater degree of not only tolerance but effective collaboration exists.”"

It is possible to return to honesty. The tears of the mothers of Naples are asking this of you,"" he said.Since his election two years ago, Francis - who renounced the spacious papal apartments used by his predecessors and lives in a small apartment in a Vatican guest house - has made the defense of the poor and weakest members of society a key plank of his papacy.He has also said members of organized crime excommunicate themselves from the Church, and that it would welcome them back if they repent.After the Mass, the pope shared a meal with about 120 male and female inmates in a city jail, among them several transsexuals and AIDS sufferers chosen to represent those sectors of the local prison population, a Church official said.Earlier, in Scampia, where drugs are sold openly and youth unemployment is more than 40 percent, Francis listened to a Filipino immigrant woman and an unemployed Italian man tell of their difficulties and a magistrate speak of ""juvenile delinquency, desperation and death"" in Naples.The pope defended immigrants, saying they could not be considered ""second-class human beings."" He called for just wages for workers, and railed against corruption in public life.""How much corruption there is in the world! I hope you have the courage ... to clean up the city and clean up society so that there is no longer that stink of corruption,"" he said. (Editing by Pravin Char and Kevin Liffey)"

Standing in a space with complete strangers staring at another's insides splattered on canvas for all to see, judge and interpret. Sometimes the space that holds the collections are as impressive as what's housed inside. What a piece evokes, differs, but there are some pieces that elicit a common enough response that we all agree upon its rarity. It informs, it stills and it uplifts us in a way we cannot describe, but know we have experienced. The visual moves us internally and viscerally.When I was a young girl in Africa, my father taught me to look at the world differently. He made me hold an apple and asked me to describe it. My first offense was to call it round. He said, ""Look again."" And made me see that round as a description was lazy. The apple was almost even on the top and the bottom. I then had to describe the color -- it was not just green, but a particular kind of green. What did it bring to mind? It was shiny-bright, not grass green, not emerald green -- how else to describe it but -- Granny Smith green, softly flushed with a burnt amber, like blush on a woman's cheeks. That satisfied him. He taught me to look at the world as not a blur to the destination, but as art in my journey. It was his most special gift to me.There are days when I'm exhausted and the world has gathered its forces to thwart me. When all of my focus has to be reigned in to get through the moment. When I look up and see a frown etched on my expression, my shoulders bowed with stress. We all have those days. Then, while stopped at a traffic light, the view my eyes see interrupt my worry, impinge on my consciousness, force me to see my world, and it lifts me. It takes my concerns and pushes it aside and says: See the gift before you. Drink in its beauty. Wallow in the colors. Keen at the splendor.It's in the leaves scattered in a car park. It's in the boughs laden with blossoms on a street. It's in the sunsets and sunrises. The clouds painted in ever-changing art in the sky. In our mad rush of life, art is not just something to visit in a gallery. Those depictions are of life, caught in its purity, buried in our souls, that we take for granted, and when faced with it likeness on a wall, the recognition awakes a recollection of when we saw the world that way. Through the eons nature has made us smile. From the first cave paintings, people have tried to capture the wonder they see. We document the moment on our phones. We hang the likeness on our walls. Collectors pay a lot to possess the creations. And yes, people line up to see the visuals in galleries. It's universal.But I'd like to suggest, that while all that we see contained, framed, protected, preserved, as homaged creations, their inspirations may as easily be experienced in our daily lives. All that is required is the willingness to see. To let our mood be altered by the wind in the trees, petals carpeting asphalt, the determination of a plant to push through a crevice in a sidewalk. If we look to nature as art to grow our smiles, maybe we'll be more tolerant of the infractions of man bowed in his quest to achieve and hoard more. Maybe it will manifest in letting someone in on the freeway. Of smiling when caught in the checkout stand and the person in front of you makes everyone wait while they search for the item they forgot. Maybe if we balance our stress with the beauty around us, it will spill out in our interactions, grant grace to ourselves and to others, and make the world a better place. Maybe. Let's try. See beauty. Let it fill you. Live it. Now."
