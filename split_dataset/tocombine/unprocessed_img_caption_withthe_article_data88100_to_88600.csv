Thank God, we managed to escape,"" Thinni said. He did not elaborate.Parliament speaker Aqila Saleh had asked Thinni to leave the assembly for his safety after protesters opposed to his government gathered outside the naval base where the parliament meets, two lawmakers told Reuters.A burning car could be seen outside the gated venue, lawmakers said. The session resumed after Thinni's departure. Thinni works out of Bayda, near Tobruk to the west.It was the latest disruption in a tumultuous year for the House of Representatives, which has like Thinni struggled to stamp its authority over an increasingly fragmented country.Thinni's government had originally planned to set up parliament in the main eastern city of Benghazi but relocated to Tobruk near the Egyptian border after Benghazi turned into a battleground between the government and Islamist militants.Parliament initially opened in a Tobruk hotel but moved to the naval base after a suicide bomber detonated a car in front of the hotel in December.The House of Representatives is being challenged by a Tripoli-based assembly known as General National Congress set up after a rival faction seized the capital in August.

The actor, who has struggled with alcoholism and substance abuse for years, issued a statement via his fiancée Mara Lane's Instagram account on Tuesday in an attempt to explain the photos: Mara and I are thankful for your support and kindness during this time. I apologize for having a minor relapse and hope that people don't think too badly of me. I stopped drinking immediately and it is no reflection on Damascus Cover as I was not meant to attend Cannes this year and I apologize to fans and colleagues. I am on the mend and thank well wishers and sorry for my disheveled appearance as I was on my way home from a friends and had not changed I feel I made a mistake and feel quite embarrassed but this was just a blip in my recovery otherwise I'm living a healthy life.  Love and blessings.The road to recovery has been a long one for the Irish actor, who was previously hospitalized in 2011 after suffering a relapse and arrested several times for getting in drunk brawls -- specifically in airports.   In 2013, he seemed to think he put the problem behind him. ""I was wild, I was as wild as you can get. When you are on the front of newspapers for stupidity, getting drunk at airports, fighting with cops and stuff like that, you wake up the next day and you can hardly fucking remember it,"" he told the U.K. paper The Mirror. He added, ""As you get older you see the stupid things you have done. It is not the consequences for yourself but your family get hurt, your friends get hurt. At some point you come to a place –- and I was lucky because some of my friends have never got to that place -– where I saw it as something that was separate from me. It is kind of insanity to do it to that level. I was able to come to that realization and I look for different things in life now."" "

The study, which journalists like The Economist’s Ryan Avent and Vox’s Tim Lee have written about, was made publicly available as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper earlier this month.While we know that cities and metro areas contribute massively to economic growth—the nation’s 380 plus metro areas generated $14.6 trillion in GDP in 2012, about 90 percent of the total—we know a great deal less about which factors limit the growth of cities and metros. Economists such as Edward Glaeser have raised important questions about how antiquated zoning, building codes and NIMBYism restrict development and therefore damage the economy, but until this study no one had developed defensible estimates of the costs of such constrained development on the U.S. economy broadly. The title of the study, “Why Cities Matter: Local Growth and Aggregate Growth,” reflects Hsieh and Moretti’s focus on ferreting out the contributions cities and metros do—or don’t—make to overall U.S. economic growth.To get at this, Hsieh and Moretti develop a statistical model—a spatial equilibrium model to be more precise—of the contribution each U.S. city and metro make to national economic growth. Their model traces the economic contribution of 220 metros to overall U.S. economic growth over the more than five decade period spanning 1964 (the first year for which comprehensive data on wages for metros is available) to 2009, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns (CBP) and supplemented with data on the characteristics of workers (race, gender, age, union status and educational attainment) from the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey. To look at the effects of housing on wages and productivity, the economists use data on housing supply developed by MIT economist Albert Saiz, and look specifically at the effects of policies that restrict the supply of housing via the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index.Put more simply, the economists’ research examines the geographic allocation of workers across the United States, and tests the following proposition: What might happen if workers were free to move to the cities and metros with the most robust economies, where they could be most productive, thus fueling even greater productivity and growth for the U.S. economy as a whole? To get at this, Hsieh and Moretti develop a number of alternative scenarios based on the ability of workers to move to and settle in these highly productive metros. The exercise leads to several intriguing findings.The Limits of Superstar CitiesFirst off, Hsieh and Moretti find that when they take wages into account, economic growth over the past half century was powered by a limited number of metro areas. Specifically, they find that roughly 75 percent of the nation’s economic growth between 1964 and 2009 came from a relatively small group of Southern metros and 19 other large metros. Even though superstar metros like New York, San Francisco, and San Jose created great wealth in sectors like finance and high-tech, nearly all of those gains were eaten up by the wages used to pay for higher housing costs. Greater New York, for example, was singlehandedly responsible for 12 percent of the nation’s aggregate output growth between 1964 and 2009, but when housing costs are taken into account, that figure falls to less than 5 percent growth. As the authors point out, “the main effect of the fast productivity growth in New York, San Francisco, and San Jose was an increase in local housing prices and local wages, not in employment.”The crux of the economists’ analysis is their models, which create an “alternate universe” where workers can move freely to where they can contribute the most to the U.S. economy. They note the substantial wage differentials between the superstar cities of New York, San Francisco and San Jose and others over the past half-century. To correct for this, their models essentially reallocate workers in today’s economy according to the prevailing wage back in 1964. Based on this, they find that employment in New York would increase by nearly 800 percent, while it would grow by more than 500 percent in San Jose and San Francisco.Overall, the economists calculate this would amount to an annual wage increase of $8,775 for the average worker. If the geographic dispersion of wages was the same in 2009 as it was in 1964, they estimate that America’s overall GDP in 2009 would have been 13.5 percent higher—a nearly $2 trillion economic gain.The next step in their analysis considers why workers are not flowing to the most productive locations. Specifically, they look at whether the issue is that superstar cities like New York and San Francisco have become too crowded, noisy and unpleasant, or whether it’s policies like zoning and building codes, or NIMBYism, that restrict the supply of housing. Their next set of models relax housing and land use restrictions in these superstar cities to those of the median American metro. Now the economists find that U.S productivity increases by 9.7 percent, or roughly $1.4 trillion.What Hsieh and Moretti have conducted here is a provocative thought experiment. To their credit, they take great pains to point out the caveats and limitations to their findings. There are many ways to frame these scenarios and slice and dice these numbers. That said, the economists’ estimates provide a stark reminder of the very real hit the U.S. economy takes every year because of its inefficient and suboptimal spatial structure. Instead of fueling productivity and growth, too much of America’s urban economic power is simply being wasted on higher housing bills.Their analysis also reminds us of how spiky and uneven the knowledge economy is. This is a natural result of the clustering force—the basic motor of economic growth. Left to its own devices, without the impediments of higher housing costs and other factors, the U.S. economy would not only be more productive, but far, far more uneven and spikier than it currently is. While cities are certainly crucial to economic growth and while mayors can do a great deal, coping with this kind of inequality between and within places requires a concerted national urban policy.Transit Is (Part of) the AnswerHow to begin to fix the problem? Here the authors offer a welcome corrective to the naïve notion promoted by too many urban economists that simply loosening housing restrictions and overcoming urban NIMBYism will magically solve the problems of America’s superstar cities.Moretti and Hseih rightly point out that a big part of the solution lies in transit. As I have long argued, transit is a key part of the great reset required for our current era of knowledge-based capitalism.Transit can work on two levels. Within metros, it can more seamlessly connect suburban areas to the more clustered urban core, enabling workers to commute from greater distances while also spurring denser clustering and development along transit corridors. And it can help stretch labor and housing markets across metros, creating more economically functional mega-regions. As Moretti and Hsieh point out, high-speed rail would help connect “local labor markets characterized by high productivity and high nominal wages to local labor markets characterized by low nominal wages.” They specifically cite the example of California’s high-speed rail line, which could “connect low-wage cities in California’s Central Valley—Sacramento, Stockton, Modesto, Fresno—to high productivity jobs in the San Francisco Bay Area.““This could allow the labor supply to the San Francisco economy to increase overnight without changing San Francisco housing supply constraints,” they conclude. The economists point to the vast transit networks in London and Tokyo as a way to cope with the constraint of high housing prices. Even though wages in these two cities are high, the authors point out they would be even higher without such extensive transit. The U.K. and Japan are substantially richer as a result.The transition from industrial capitalism to a placed-based knowledge economy will not just magically happen. Moretti and Hsieh’s study reminds us of the enormous costs of trying to run the powerful, highly clustered new economy on the platform of our outmoded suburban, industrial model. Unleashing the productive power of this new age requires a spatial fix based on transit-based infrastructure and a more flexible housing system. Without that, as Moretti and Hsieh so pointedly remind us, we will continue to squander this country’s productive potential, its economic performance and, critically, our overall well-being."

Old Havana is full of charm, life, music, color, and tourists. It features architectural styles, including neoclassical and grand colonial, with courtyards and covered walkways, and some Art Deco. There are five fabulously impressive public squares. The Capitol building in Havana looks like the Capitol in Washington, DC, only smaller.  El CapitolioMy favorite attractions were the Museo Hemingway, Museo de la Revolución, and the Cigar Factory. The restoration efforts seem endless, but no one seems to know the plan for when anything might be completed.  Hemmingway's Study.Central Havana, on the other hand, is poor and developing. It is common for many generations to live under a single room. Homes are generally dilapidated and, by Western standards, would be considered slums. Many buildings are falling apart from neglect. People don't own homes; instead, they trade them as people die or babies are born.Havana is generally very safe; there are few gun or knife fights. While there are some robberies, tourists are generally left alone. But the country teems with unrealized potential. Pre-revolution Cuba was flourishing with newspapers and magazines, but today there is very little in the way of independent media. José Marti and Ché Guevara are national heroes, but there were no pictures of Castro on plazas or street signs. There was, in fact, no signage or advertising at all. And of course, no Starbucks or McDonald's.Although Havana is a port, there were no sailboats, fishing boats, or any pleasure boats. In fact, there was hardly a beach community. On the boardwalk along the Atlantic called Malecón, people were all looking inwards, never out at sea. There were few joggers, and no restaurants with views of the sea. The restaurants, called paladares, are small family-run businesses that are permitted to operate privately by paying a monthly tax to the state. No locals frequent these establishments, only tourists, due to the expense. We found some very nice ones with lovely gardens, but some were uninteresting and expensive, located in small rooms filled with tourist groups. The state has set up an extensive vocational school system where students study masonry, woodcutting, tile building, and fresco refurbishing. I wondered where they got the authentic craftsmen to do this, but no one knew. Although the Cuban educational system is highly regarded, many of our tour guides did not have any information on subjects that the state does not want Cubans to know about. When I asked one of our guides to tell me more about Batista, the Cuban dictator who was overthrown during the revolution, she knew a couple of dates but had no stories or insights. As many Internet sites are blocked and most Cubans lack access to the Internet, it is almost impossible for locals to obtain basic information or context.Cubans who work in tourism do have some connectivity in their offices, but it is spotty. The Internet connection was equally unreliable in hotels, even the best. It was impossible to download any newspapers. One paper in Cuba called Granma, named after the boat Fidel took from Mexico for the purpose of overthrowing Batista, was in fact more of a pamphlet.I asked another tour guide if Castro would be embalmed like Stalin, Lenin, Mao, Kim Jong-il, and other Communist leaders, but she had no idea what I was talking about. No Cubans seem to know much about Fidel--his health, his family, or where he lives. With no press, how could they? They are hopeful with Raul. They all say, ""it is about time,"" meaning they welcome change. We spoke to several economists at the University of Havana. Some had studied decades ago in the United States or Canada. While they often get invited to conferences in the States, they can never get a visa to attend. One PhD economist said he got a call maybe a year after a conference asking if he was still interested in attending. Of course, the forum had happened 11 months earlier. There's fairly light traffic--just a few old Russian cars and tourist-type, two-person taxis called Cocomobiles. Our Cocomobile driver had a PhD in computer science, but he made a lot more money driving a tourist taxi. I asked him if he had ever been off the island. He eagerly said that he had been to Mexico and Grand Cayman and explained that after university, he and a few pals got a job on a Cuban boat. He then admitted, however, that they were not allowed off the boat when it docked, so he had really only seen these other places.  A Ford Fairlane.Most Cubans, even highly educated ones, earn little--the equivalent of $20 a month. They get ration cards for soap and chicken (a two-pound ration per person). I asked to look at the ration cards, which are kept in index boxes. There are no digital records, of course. Rice, beans, and toothpaste are fairly standard items. But when something as precious as eggs or fruit shows up at the ration store, lines form in a moment, and people will wait for hours. Cubans often joke that their national past time is waiting in line. On the weekend, we saw an ice cream stand. The line stretched for seven or eight blocks, and it was hot, but people seemed to be happy, making friends, and taking it all in stride. If you see an iPhone 3 or 4, Nike's, or designer jeans, these are all from American relatives. Cubans are very proud of their local art and music.The monetary system, in any case, is in tatters. Everyone gets paid in Cuban pesos. But CUCs, or the Cuban convertible peso, is the currency for people working in the travel industry. There are absolutely no credit cards. The hotel, tour guides, drivers, bell boys, and restaurants for tourists all took tips from tourists in CUCs. So anyone who works in the tourism industry makes a lot more than even PhDs and doctors. Our cigar guide, for example, makes roughly 120 dollars in CUC-denominated tips, while his wife, a neurosurgeon, makes the equivalent of only 24 dollars a month in Cuban pesos. I visited a community center in Central Havana called Casa del Niño y de la Niña, which works to keep kids off the streets after school. It consists of a single large room that is decorated with kids' coloring. The theme when I visited was José Marti and children's rights. The center has only one computer, which was an 80's model. Internet costs eight dollars an hour, if you can ever get it, which is far too expensive, of course. The children do learn how to use a keyboard, however, and play games and music on the computer.  Casa del Niño y de la Niña Community CenterI met about 15 children ranging from kindergarteners to seventh graders. Because it was spring break, they were not in uniforms. While there is no air conditioning, the place is very clean, with old plastic chairs that were donated by UNICEF. They were beautiful kids--happy and full of hope. They love the United States, and a few know who Obama is. They like French fries and pizza and know what ice cream is, though only a few have tasted it. All live with at least three generations. They sang for me and invited me to dance. Each one recited a sentence on what they had been learning about, regarding the rights of children in Cuba.""I have a right to not be hungry.""""I have a right to be safe.""""I have a right to have a home.""""I have a right to go to school.""""I have a right to study.""""I have a right to have a right.""Countries like North Korea and Burma are so far away and cut off that they can seem hard to grasp. But Cuba is close to our shores and with so many Cuban-Americans in the United States, it was disquieting to see the country in such a state of deprivation. The Cuban people have so much potential, and El Comandante has done such a disservice to them."
7,POLITICS,What Has the U.S. Learned from Its Military History,"Robert Hardaway, ContributorProfessor of Law, University of Denver",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-has-the-us-learned-from-its-military-history_b_7443324.html,"Ever since the American Revolutionary War, a startling statistic has emerged: the U.S. has not lost a single conventional war, but not won even a single guerrilla war. What can be learned from this experience?",2015-05-26,"U.S. troops take their positions during a combined assault exercise at a beach facing one of the contested islands off the South China Sea known as Scarborough Shoal in the West Philippine Sea Tuesday, April 21, 2015 at the Naval Education and Training Command at San Antonio township, Zambales province, northwest of Manila, Philippines. More than ten thousand troops from both the US and Philippine militaries are taking part in the annual military drill that focuses on regional security, terrorism, disaster preparedness and inter-operability of both countries.

What can be learned from this experience?Before arriving at the obvious answer, consider that the trillions of dollars that the U.S. spends on conventional weapons is largely neutralized in guerrilla wars by such cheap and homemade weapons as improvised explosive devices. Guerrilla opponents can employ, and have employed the most inhumane, barbarous tactics, which though very effective, especially in long and drawn out wars, cannot and should not be morally countered with similar tactics by any civilized country on earth.  Generals can be blamed for so often fighting the last war, as when in World War I they mindlessly ordered massive infantry and cavalry charges in the face of machine guns which mowed them down by the millions, or as the French generals did in the early phases of World War II when they relied on fixed defensive positions such as the Maginot Line, which German blitzkrieging tanks simply went around.  But politicians can and should be blamed for choosing the wrong kind of war for their generals to fight. In Gulf War I, the U.S. faced one of the largest conventional military forces in the world, but easily dispatched Saddam's forces in a manner of days with technologically advanced conventional weapons. Then having achieved its limited objective of expelling the invaders of Kuwait, American forces withdrew, victorious, intact and with only a relative handful of battlefield casualties. In Gulf War II, however, the U.S. insisted on staying and engaging in a protracted guerrilla war of the kind it has never won before, and probably never will. As in the closing days of the Vietnam War, Americans are treated to the horrifying spectacle of U.S. weapons being confiscated by victorious and ruthless guerrillas overrunning the hapless conventional indigenous forces that the U.S. purported to ""train"" in hopes of replacing withdrawing U.S. troops -- a delusive strategy which is working no better in Iraq today than President Richard Nixon's futile ""Vietnamization"" strategy.   No doubt, the politicians will yet again learn the wrong lessons from the previous war. After World War I, the ""lesson"" learned by British and American politicians was that those countries should never again be involved in a European war. This wrong lesson ultimately led to unpreparedness, Munich, and an ultimately unavoidable war against Fascism. After the Korean War, which preserved a democratic and prosperous South Korea, the politicians yet again learned the wrong lesson by failing to see the difference between conventional war in Korea and a guerrilla civil war in Vietnam -- another wrong lesson which yet again ultimately led to the disastrous defeat of the United States.   In the early 1960s when U.S. politicians, determined to contain communism, were faced with the choice of a five day conventional war against the imminent nuclear threat in Cuba, or a futile ten-year guerrilla war in Vietnam, they inevitably chose the latter based on the wrong lessons learned -- yet again, letting the enemy choose the battlefield.  Let us hope that history really doesn't repeat itself as we watch the spectacle now occurring in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, it probably already has."

From Rodney King in L.A. in the 1990s, to the marches we organized for Eric Garner in Staten Island, to eulogizing and rallying on behalf of young Michael Brown in Ferguson, we have worked tirelessly in this area. Along with pushing for things like access to health care for all and corporate accountability, police reform has been a fundamental focus of the work that we do. But in all those years, I've never seen a situation that will force a national election to deal with policing as I do now at this very moment. Over the weekend, as news broke that that Judge John P. O'Donnell acquitted officer Michael Brelo for his role in the 2012 fatal shooting of an unarmed Black male and female in a car in Cleveland (about a dozen officers fired a total of 137 rounds at the car), protests immediately broke out. As the city of Cleveland and the state of Ohio grapple with how to proceed forward, it's important to remember that this precise area of the nation is the site of the 2016 Republican National Convention. Translation: GOP candidates will actually have to deal with policing as an issue.The Justice Department has reached an unprecedented settlement with Cleveland over what they said was a pattern of unconstitutional policing and excessive use of force. In fact, the Department began its investigation into Cleveland police just a few months after the 2012 shooting for which officer Brelo was just acquitted (no other officers were charged with manslaughter).The citizens of Cleveland, and Ohio for that matter, were reminded of the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot and killed by police while playing with a toy gun (his mother has marched with NAN in Washington, D.C. and New York). Half a year after Rice's death, the case is still under investigation. Incidents like this and acquittals like Brelo's are simply inexcusable. The NAACP, faith leaders and others have all publicly called for me to lead efforts going forward to say that protests must be nonviolent and geared towards reconciliation, but with the goal of real change.Ohio has always played a significant role in elections. It is a critical state that must be won by Republicans in order to win the White House next year. The Governor of Ohio has all but announced that he's running for the presidency, and again, Cleveland is the site of the GOP convention next year. These three facts alone mean that Republicans can no longer stay silent on policing issues even though they largely ignored Ferguson, Staten Island, Baltimore and more.When they come to Cleveland to convene, they will be coming to a city and a state under high mobilization around this issue. They cannot choreograph a convention in a city that the Justice Department just cited, and they cannot choreograph a convention in a state with such graphic cases of police brutality. They simply cannot win Ohio without dealing with police misconduct in that state from the killing of John Crawford III in a Walmart store, to Tanisha Anderson who died while in police custody (her death was ruled a homicide), and all the way up to Tamir Rice.  As we escalate calls for national police policy, and cases to be handled by special state prosecutors or the Justice Department in order to take politics out of the equation, we call on GOP candidates to tell the nation where they stand on these critical subjects. Ignoring the challenges will not make them go away. Acting as if Americans are not concerned with the current state of things will not win you votes. People elect leaders that can lead -- not ones who dance around problems. If Republicans think that they can go to a critical state to hold a convention without addressing police brutality and reform, they might want to think again.I say to all 15 or more GOP candidates that have largely remained quiet on this topic, as you begin primaries and head to Cleveland, remember the words of legendary boxer Joe Louis: You can run, but you can't hide."
9,WORLDPOST,Why Pope Francis Wants Oscar Romero To Be a Saint,"Paul Vallely, ContributorAuthor, “Pope Francis: The Struggle for the Soul of Catholicis...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis_2_b_7443834.html,Romero was a man who was at once utterly orthodox and yet utterly radical. That is the model Pope Francis seems to be setting for himself.,2015-05-26,"A pilgrim carries a portrait of Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero to Romero's beatification ceremony in San Salvador, El Salvador, Saturday, May 23, 2015. Huge crowds are expected at the ceremony to beatify Romero, who was cut down by an assassin's bullet 35 years ago and declared a martyr for his faith this year by Pope Francis. (AP Photo/Moises Castillo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14dba2300003200d0c946.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A golden thread links Pope Francis to Oscar Romero, the murdered archbishop whose beatification the Pope ordered to take place last weekend, to the rapturous acclaim of the people of El Salvador and the wider world. The thread is that of liberation theology, the movement that swept through Latin America, and then other parts of the world, 40 years ago. It maintains that the Gospel contains a preference for poor people -- and insists that the Church has a duty to work for political and economic as well as spiritual change.Conservatives in the Catholic Church do not like this. They have taken to asserting that Romero was not a liberation theologian. There is an irony in that, for they had spent the previous three decades blocking Romero's path to sainthood by arguing the opposite. Then they said that to canonize the murdered cleric would effectively endorse liberation theology too. Conservatives saw this radical pro-poor movement, at the height of the Cold War, as a Marxist Trojan horse that would allow communism into South America through the back door. Its followers saw it as the words of Jesus in action. In the years that followed, the mainstream Catholic Church took on board many of the insights of liberation theology. But conservatives in the Vatican and in the Latin American hierarchy worked behind the scenes to counter its influence -- and block any attempts to move Romero along the path to becoming a saint.There is an effective answer to these machinations and manoeuvrings. It is the one given by the man who is indisputably one of the founding fathers of liberation theology, Leonardo Boff, a former Franciscan friar who left the priesthood after the Vatican ordered him to a period of ""obsequious silence"" under the conservative papacies of John Paul II and Benedict XVI.When asked if Pope Francis was a liberation theologian, Boff gave an answer that would apply as aptly to Romero. ""The important thing is not whether he is for liberation theology but [whether he is] for the liberation of the oppressed, the poor and the victims of injustice. And that he is without question. Pope Francis has lived liberation theology."" Oscar Romero lived it too. He was not a theoretical theologian. He stood unflinchingly by the poor -- and died for it. He began as a conservative but events changed him. He became archbishop of San Salvador in 1977 at a time when community leaders and priests who spoke out over the nation's extreme and pervasive poverty were being killed by death squads in the pay of the country's exploitative coffee barons. Rural peasants and urban demonstrators were massacred on the streets by the army. Political prisoners were kidnapped and tortured. Churches were desecrated, and diocesan radio stations and newspapers bombed. Romero spoke out against all that. It made him, to the repressive elite, a communist in a cassock. He was shot dead at the altar.The ordinary people swiftly acclaimed him a saint, calling him St. Romero of the Americas. But conservatives in the Vatican and among the Latin American bishops stalled the canonization process for Romero for more than three decades. Eventually they ran out of excuses to keep blocking recognition of his transparent martyrdom. So they began to insist he was not really a liberation theologian. It was a blatant attempt to separate the martyr from the theological movement he embodied.All this had deep resonance for Pope Francis who saw in Romero a model for his own spiritual journey. Like Romero, he had also begun as a conservative. As leader of the Jesuits in Argentina in the 1970s, Francis had seen it as his job to stamp out liberation theology. But events changed him too. His authoritarian leadership of the Jesuits ended with him being sent into exile after presiding over a deep and bitter split inside the order. In those two years of exile, he underwent what he has since called ""a time of great interior crisis"" and emerged with a much more consultative leadership style. As Bishop of the Slums in Buenos Aires, his prolonged contact with poor people brought a change in him. Before he had seen them as victims in need of charity. Now he began to see them as people who needed help to take charge of their own lives. He began to back self-help groups, co-operatives and unions -- exactly the kind of work he had banned among Jesuit liberation theologians 20 years before. ""Experiencing the life values of the poor transformed his heart,"" as one of his shantytown priests, Fr. José María di Paola, put it.When Argentina went into a massive financial crisis in 2001, with the biggest debt default in world history, half the country's population was plunged below the poverty line. The resulting hardship made Francis see that economic systems, not just individuals, could be sinful. He began to use the language of liberation theology in his castigations of the government and the international financial system with its austerity ""medicine"" of cuts to the services on which the poor relied.He has continued that language as Pope, with fierce criticisms of global capitalism in the two years since he took office. And he has rehabilitated liberation theology by inviting its key exponents to the Vatican and into dialogue with him on his forthcoming major document on the environment. Rome's key doctrinal watchdog has declared that liberation theology should ""be included among the most important currents in 20th century Catholic theology.""Oscar Romero is therefore not simply, for Pope Francis, a man whose courageous death needs to be honored. He is a priest whose life stands in testament to the kind of Catholicism preferred by a pope who declared within days of his election that he wanted ""a poor Church for the poor.""Romero is an exemplar for Francis as he launches on what may well be a defining period in his pontificate. The next six months will bring three key events. The Pope's long-awaited encyclical on the environment and climate change is due next month. Then come official visits to South and then North America. And then comes a Synod in Rome that could bring changes to the approach of the Catholic Church to issues like divorce and homosexuality.Romero was a man who was at once utterly orthodox and yet utterly radical. That is the model Pope Francis seems to be setting for himself.Paul Vallely is the author of Pope Francis - the Struggle for the Soul of Catholicism, to be published by Bloomsbury in September."

With a little bit of instruction and a lot of time soaking up Youtube know-how, Stuart decided to create his own channel and video based on his passion for music, magic and social experiements. The result was spectacular.  27 million views later, ""Mistletoe Kissing Prank"" put Stuart on the creator map and he never looked back. I flew Stuart out from his home base in Provo, Utah to my neighborhood in Southern California to learn everything I could about creating content from someone who is ""edging"" closer to the big leagues of mainstream entertainment with over 2 million subscribers. Here are some of my take-away lessons:1. The best content leaves your audience feeling ""Wow!"" In a time when the barriers to entry to make a video are so low and according to Youtube, over 300 hours of video are being uploaded to Youtube every minute, your content better kick booty. If you're not trying to ""Wow!"" your auidience every time then you shouldn't be surprised if your video has 23 views (and 20 of them are you). Of course I knew this but talking with Stuart really underscored the importance of it to me. Watch the video and the car I'm driving and you'll see me put this principle to the test!2. Don't give up so soon This is probably good advice for anyone doing any kind of work that matters. But it is especially important for content creators with a vision. Nothing worthwhile comes without a price, does it? Sometimes you have to grind it down to get to the good stuff under the thick outer layers that keep most people out. Relationships. Good health. Becoming a competitive athlete. Finishing college. Starting a business. Whatever...When the going gets tough, don't quit if it's worth it. Stuart reminded me that we all have set backs and not everyone has a 27 million view hit video every time. It's about being patient and thinking and acting long-term. It's about staying in the boat even during the storms. And most of the time it's about reinvention and honing your skills.  3. Go ahead and put all your eggs in one basket Over the past year Stuart has been asking his a audience on Youtube to join him on Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter. Those platforms have grown, but at the expense of his video views and subscribers. The result has been a gradual watering down of his potency on Youtube. The lesson here is about going all in or putting all your best eggs in the basket that is paying the bills. He's recalibrated his approach and returning to his video roots to put all his best stuff on his Youtube channel. Snapchat and other channels will be places to catch behind the scenes stuff and other ancillary content that doesn't cannibalize his sizable Youtube income.What else did you learn from watching the full-length episode?

Those moments may have to be a little more clandestine than in the past, so as not to risk the appearance of being uncool. Yet I receive with such joy the simple statement, especially when said in front of a gaggle of other teenagers, ""love you dad"". That to me is the epitome of cool!Learning is a 360-degree process. Our best lessons come often from those with the least amount of life experiences. Maybe that is due to their eyes not yet being clouded by cynicism, which can occlude one's ability to see the truth and find the answers we are seeking. I have learned a lot from my son and I am very proud of him, something I try to share often. Yet in a house where the lifeblood is sarcasm and humor, my praise is often veiled in that dressing. So, I thought I would share with him and all of you some of the lessons he has taught me. Our best lessons come often from those with the least amount of life experiences. Maybe that is due to their eyes not yet being clouded by cynicism, which can occlude one's ability to see the truth and find the answers we are seeking.Envision the future, know your desired outcome and take action. When I was 16 all I wanted was a girlfriend, a car and tickets to the Flock of Seagulls concert. My son, he wants to be an attorney and has said so for a couple of years. His teaching is in the fact that he did not allow his desire to be simply talk. He took action to get himself closer to his goal. He has chosen to push himself academically; he participated in the Mock Trial team, and joined Future Business Leaders of America. He even asked my wife and me to buy him a couple of suits, which he is all too happy to wear. Something he definitely did not get from his dad. He knows where he wants to be, he understands what it will look like when he gets there and he is taking the needed steps to get there now; a pretty good lesson for all business leaders. Drive in stride. My son is driven, as are his older sisters, mom and dad. I guess it is a family trait. Yet where he separates himself is in his ability to face the pressure that emanates from being driven with a sense of calm and stability. I, on the other hand, have the proclivity of a worrier. Left unchecked, I can chew up time and energy in rumination and produce far too much internal stress. He somehow naturally absorbs it, understands it is transitory, and that life continues regardless. He is able to juggle school and extracurricular activities and still find the time to be a16 year-old that plays X-Box and hangs out with friends. He does it all with grace and in the absence of worry and anxiety, he is able accomplish so much in such short periods of time. I am not sure if that is because he understands that these demands are impermanent, and therefore, grasps the foolishness in his getting lost in worry or, if he is just oblivious. Nevertheless, it is a great reminder of how we would all benefit from letting go of the worry and just focusing on the task at hand.   Embrace embarrassment. We were talking about this before he left for a friend's birthday party. We discussed the fact that there would be dancing at this party and that he is always the one willing to get out on the floor first and make a fool of himself. Once he did that, it was as if it gave permission to the others to do the same. This is a lesson on the benefit of vulnerability. Leaders who show vulnerability, which is different from weakness, empower their teams. It communicates that to try and fail, to feel silly, or to be out of one's comfort zone is okay. That to feel exposed and to place your self-identity at risk in order to grow should be applauded not feared. We are often trapped by the sense of self we feel we must portray and therefore, suppress our true self from fully manifesting. So it is good to find yourself a little embarrassed, it signals that you are pushing past what makes you comfortable. I am grateful for the wise and somewhat oblivious teacher I find in my son. Now if he only learned to clean his room, not eat us out of house and home, leaving a debris field in his wake, and ditch some of the teenage drama, all would be great. The most important learning is that we should all be aware that lessons can appear from the most unlikely of sources, colleagues, employees, friends, neighbors and even 16-year-old hipsters. The key is to seek knowledge and remain open, receptive and inquisitive. One source for me is in my work to help businesses and business leaders grow. In doing so, I find myself growing as well.

Clinton arrived in Chicago after campaigning Monday and Tuesday in Iowa. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fa673c000018010e0337.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Coauthored with Brenda WrightHillary Clinton told supporters on Thursday that if elected she will appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Citizens United, according to a Washington Post report. This is good news for our democracy -- but the Court's role in helping wealthy interests dominate politics goes far deeper than one bad case. In fact, justices appointed by the next president -- whoever that is -- should look to transform the Supreme Court's entire approach to money in politics going back to cases starting in the 1970s, just as the Court has reversed course on New Deal economic protections, racial segregation, LGBT rights, and more.Secretary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders -- who last week outlined a similar requirement for future justices -- should be applauded for recognizing the damage Citizens United has done, even as they campaign in the broken system the Roberts Court has created. Our democracy has descended into a shouting match between billionaires and corporate interests, who have more tools than ever to drown out the rest of our voices.But the reality is that Citizens United merely added fuel to an already blazing fire -- and returning to the ""glory days"" before the decision will not create an America where we all have an equal say over the government decisions that affect our lives.There are two reasons for this. First, many of the unlimited contributions driving the sharp rise in ""outside spending"" have come from wealthy individuals rather than corporate treasuries. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam, for example, gave more than $92 million to Super PACs in the 2012 cycle. But, because of flawed Supreme Court decisions long before Citizens United, they would still be allowed to spend every cent of that money even if Citizens United is overturned, as long as they spend it themselves instead of by contributing to a political committee.Moreover, money in politics has long played a profound--and unseen--role in shaping the field of candidates. A narrow band of wealthy donors acted as gatekeepers to public power well before Citizens United and would continue to do so if just that decision is reversed. We're seeing this now, as presidential hopefuls compete for donor support before even officially declaring as candidates. But it's just as prevalent in filtering the candidate pool in races for Congress or state house. Candidates for U.S. Senate, for example, need to raise $3,300 every day for six years just to keep pace with their rivals -- and typically get the majority of that money in contributions of at least $1000 from a fraction of one percent of the population.This ""wealth primary"" is a big reason why elected officials across the country are much whiter and wealthier than our population, and sharply more responsive to the priorities of the ""donor class.""The Supreme Court is largely to blame. Since a 1976 case called Buckley v. Valeo -- sometimes called the ""original sin"" of campaign finance law -- the justices have said that we are not allowed to fight this problem directly because leveling the playing field between wealthy donors and the rest of us is not a legitimate reason to limit big money. Rather, We the People can only seek to eliminate corruption or its appearance. The Roberts Court has doubled down on this idea by limiting the definition of corruption to quid pro quo bribery.This is the logic behind Citizens United -- but also behind previous cases that have shredded other democratic safeguards. It's why we can't limit the direct spending of billionaires like Sheldon Adelson, prevent wealthy candidates from spending their way into elected office, or put a cap on overall spending on campaigns by candidates or outside interests.But preventing the wealthy from translating economic might directly into political power is a profound concern for a democracy that aims for an equal voice for all of its citizens, but tolerates considerable economic inequality.We need the next generation of democracy-friendly justices to not just overturn Citizens United, but revisit Buckley, which is also the case that gave us the dubious principle that ""money is speech."" More important, the Court needs to consider a broader set of values, beyond just clean governance, as compelling reasons to limit big money: from guaranteeing all Americans the opportunity for an equal voice in the political process to promoting government that's accountable to voters, not just a few wealthy donors.The ultimate goal should be an America where the strength of a citizen's voice does not depend upon the size of her wallet. Overturning Citizens United is an important step in that direction. But, to take a giant leap forward in our nation's slow, halting drive towards truly equal citizenship for all, we'll need to rethink what the Constitution really says about the power of the People to protect our democracy.This broader transformation, not just overturning one bad case, should be a top priority for Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, or anyone else seeking the power to appoint our future justices.This piece originally appeared in The Prospect."
15,HEALTHY LIVING,How Can a Personal Trainer Boost Your Workouts?,"Ornish Living, ContributorFor anyone who is interested in leading a healthful lifestyle",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-can-a-personal-traine_b_7287666.html,"If you're starting a new exercise routine, the support of a trainer can bolster your commitment to your workout routine.",2015-05-25,2015-05-14-1431642925-5728422-PersonalTrainerTownePostNetwork.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-14-1431642925-5728422-PersonalTrainerTownePostNetwork-thumb.jpg,"If you're starting a new exercise routine, the support of a trainer can bolster your commitment to your workout routine.Many people have trouble honestly reflecting on their personal level of fitness, their success or failure and if their fitness program is working. A personal trainer's job isn't to tell you what you want to hear, but what you need to hear to become a more fit, and overall healthier person. A talented personal trainer can use this type of honesty to motivate you and help you to achieve your potential. There are personal trainers with every level of training and experience. So we need to choose wisely. The American College of Sports Medicine has a helpful brochure on how to choose and use a personal trainer. The American Council on Exercise also had some good advice. To make sure your trainer has a reputable certification, look for one of these.Here are several reasons why to seriously consider this option:Specialized Training and ExperienceA personal trainer is someone who has specialized education, training and experience in anatomy, physiology, human performance, and often nutrition and lifestyle education. Their task is to improve the physical health and fitness knowledge of their clients. Regardless of how experienced you are in athletics or how happy you might be with your current level of fitness, a personal trainer can provide a lot of benefit. Remember also that every professional athlete will utilize personal trainers, strength and conditioning coaches both during the season and in the off-season. Although they are professional athletes, they realize the benefits a personal trainer will bring to their fitness.Inspires Variety and New Goals  Most people who exercise have a limited repertoire of exercises to choose from. A personal trainer can expose you to new exercises, order of exercise and techniques to help enhance your fitness. A trainer can also help you to create new goals you may have never considered and ensure your exercise program is safe and appropriate given your age, experience and goals. They may also have great contacts such as massage therapists, yoga instructors or sports medicine physicians if you ever find the need.The Value of Commitment & AccountabilityFor people who have trouble sticking with exercise or find themselves falling off the exercise wagon, both a financial commitment and an interpersonal sense of accountability with a trainer can be powerful motivators. Ornish Program participants have shared that paying for a trainer's time, knowledge and experience propelled their workouts week and after week with a strong dose of confidence and support. Likewise, once someone has developed a rapport with their trainer, an enduring sense of accountability becomes the most meaningful catalyst. I recommend that you find the best trainer for your personal health and wellness. You only have one body to live in, so you might as well make it a fit one. What has been your experience using a personal trainer or what has held you back from using a personal trainer?This article was originally published on Ornish Living."

""They did the hard work,"" she says. ""All I did was show them in their best light.""Photo by: Paulette PhlipotPresented by Lipton Fine Art and running through the summer, ""Unprocessed"" features blowups of some of Phlipot's fruit and vegetable still lifes from her book ""Ripe,"" with recipes from Cheryl Sternman Rule  as well as an entire wall of produce from Idaho, Phlipot's home. The images correspond week by week with the produce featured in the local CSA. ""You see the progression through the season. At first, everything is really green in the spring. By the end of August, we're getting this explosion of color.""Photo by: Paulette PhlipotPhlipot began her career by taking photography for regional publications, and still does, but from the start, she kept gravitating toward food fresh from the garden. ""All I had to do is have a bunch of beautiful carrots, I'd be so excited,"" she says.""Whenever I had a spare moment, I'd grab plant-based food. I'd go to the weekly farmers market and oh, my gosh, I'd have to document this beauty. I just started capturing the food I was bringing in to eat.""Photo by: Dev KhalsaIf fresh produce is Phlipot's muse, her daughter Cassidy, now four, ""has been the driving force to pursue it in many more directions."" Not only does Cassidy eat -- and prefer -- real food, ""her excitement, her engagement when she can touch and see the fruits and vegetables encourages me to do what I'm doing."" Phlipot, who often brings her daughter on photo shoots, captures that childlike sense of joy in her images. Her process is as pure as her subject. ""There's nothing wrong about the filters and all that, but for me, it's always been easier to capture things as they are. I'm big on light, using natural light when possible. When that's not possible I work in the studio or create a studio setting on location. My technique begins with analyzing light."" She's also big on spending time with her subject, to get to know it. That, she says, is when the personality, the character of produce comes out. ""I'll take it in my hand and turn it around. I look at it. I will keep turning it around and moving it. Sometimes I cut into it -- that's a great pleasure, too, exploring, cutting into a cranberry. I want to go deeper, to know.""She aims to share both the pleasure and the knowing with ""Unprocessed."" ""I try not to preach, I let the art speak for itself, but at the same time, I hope this show encourages other to approach food differently,"" says Phlipot. ""So many of us are removed from where our food is coming from. I wanted to bring it back to basics, appreciating a cabbage for a cabbage -- what a work of art it is. We wonder why it's so hard to get children to eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Instead of pear-flavored food, let them have the whole pear experience -- bite into a pear.""  Medjool Date and Celery Salad  Phlipot turns celery into art. You can turn it into dinner It's the hero of this cool and crunchy salad, perfect now (celery season) and into summer -- (date season). "

The many crosses, punctuated by a few stars of David, are planted in the American Cemetery on a bluff above Omaha Beach in Normandy. The ground beneath my feet rumbled restlessly with the ghosts of those who are remembered on Memorial Day, and I thought about the heavy price paid by the survivors who carried home memories so terrible, many never spoke them aloud.To manage our relationship to mortality and the overwhelming power of grief, we sanitize or sequester death and corpses with elaborate rituals and fierce taboos. But war explodes these boundaries and endangers the humanity of those we send to fight. Mortuary unit workers often spend every day for months on end processing bags full of bloody, liquefied, burned or rotting fragments of bodies transported in unrefrigerated trucks. Immersed in remains of those they love, they process pieces of flesh, clean the parts and compose individual bodies to send home.Sometimes, though, in battle, there is not even time for this minimal care for the dead. As I stood on that bluff, a mass grave of 86 German soldiers was discovered in Belgium, a story told to me by a 59-year-old Belgium reserve soldier I met near Bayeux. As he noted, the war lives on in the soil of Europe, long beyond the time of winners and losers and the generations who fought.Many who serve in war are often so devastated that they are the walking dead, haunted because they cannot integrate what they experienced in war with life at home, where ordinary life can seem shallow, gray and empty after the drama and camaraderie of war. They can no longer make sense of the meaning of who they once were or who they have become, a response sometimes called moral injury. Being immersed in carnage, they come home numb, disillusioned, angry, depressed and ashamed. Moral injury comes in the aftermath of surviving; it's the long slow burn of remembering and not wanting to remember. Desperate to forget, the survivors immerse themselves in intense work and other avoidances. Still, the specters return in eruptions of angry tears in the middle of ordinary tasks, in quiet liminal moments when memories break through, or in dreams of staring children with holes in their bodies.How do moral human beings speak about the unspeakable horrors of combat, the moral anguish of war and the searing losses of one's deepest friends? Without adequate support, many self-destruct slowly through addictions, failed relationships and homelessness; others die by their own hands. We thank the troops for their service and project onto veterans what we want them to be --romantic heroes to admire, wounded warriors to help, or victims of war's evils. Instead of listening patiently with an open heart and with respect to all they have endured and cannot forget, we impose our own assumptions so we can feel better about ourselves and move on with what we are already busy doing.The young men and women who volunteer to defend their country and survive war are never going to be the same, and, if we are paying attention, the ways they have been changed should haunt us. We must do far more to reintegrate veterans into our families and communities, including carrying the burdens of memory so many find impossible to disclose. The reconstruction of heart, soul and meaning is not possible to do alone. Their moral injury belongs to us. Attending adequately to their recovery is a responsible way to remember the dead honestly, with respect. If we help carry the memories, we will be better people for the struggle and better able to understand what peace requires of us."

What happened to the staunchly conservative, almost fanatical Catholicism of the Irish people? Paul Valleley, a professor of public ethics at the University of Chester, offered some important suggestions. He lists two major reasons. One is that ""the Catholic Church has lost its grip on the Irish,"" something he attributes to ""self-destruction"" by the church as a result of priestly child abuse and physical and psychological cruelty by nuns and priests at various institutions of the church, such as the infamous Magdalene laundries. It is the second reason that I want to focus upon, however. Valleley writes:Ireland had joined the EU, giving it access to markets much larger than previously when its trade had been predominantly with Britain. That, combined with an influx of foreign investment, transformed Ireland from one of the poorest countries in Europe to one of the wealthiest. Its economy grew so powerfully in the 1990s that Ireland became known as the Celtic tiger.Ireland, according to Seán Ó'Riain's The Rise and Fall of Ireland's Celtic Tiger, was in crisis, with ""massive government debt accompanied by severe unemployment, immigration and weak labour force participation among women."" But a series of liberalizing market reforms led to ""rapid economic growth and, even more significantly, exceptionally high employment growth in the second half of the decade. The numbers employed in Ireland almost doubled between 1988 and 2008, increasing by one million jobs."" Historically, the more market-oriented the economy, the more the well-being of LGBT people increases. Politicized markets require political power, something sexual minorities rarely have, but depoliticized economies only need an entrepreneur willing to cater to a minority. Soviet-style, top-down economies would never allocate paper for books on gay issues, let alone for a thriving gay media. That required a bottom-up, depoliticized or less-politicized economy, where entrepreneurs only had to buy the paper and find a profit-seeking printer. Even in the McCarthy-dominated 1950s, the United States had publications for gay men and lesbians. In Europe these publications existed since the late 1800s, something not possible in Comstockian America at the time, mainly because postal regulations were used to close down any publication that Comstock deemed obscene, such as information on birth control.It was the Financial Times that noted the role of material wealth on social liberalism. They wrote, ""Ireland's apparent willingness to embrace gay marriage is therefore as much a product of the Celtic Tiger years as it is a reflection of the decline of the Church's influence."" With rising prosperity, Irish voters started embracing socially liberal reforms, matching the economically liberal reforms of a few years earlier: deregulation and more individual choice. Women demanded and won liberalization of contraception laws and legalization of divorce. Sociologist Tom Inglis said of Ireland, ""[W]e have all signed up for cultural liberal individualism and a laissez faire approach to civil rights."" Similar seismic shifts in cultural values occurred in other nations following periods of economic boom. The relative prosperity of the 1950s in America gave way to the social turbulence of the '60s, which saw the culmination of not only the civil rights movement but the movements for women's liberation and, of course, gay liberation. In 1943 Abraham Maslow proposed his famous hierarchy of human needs. He argued that people fulfill lower-order needs first and work their way up the pyramid. The lower three rungs are basic needs, such as food, water, and sleep; safety needs, such as employment and security; and social needs, such as family, friends, and love. The higher-order needs are esteem (respect, confidence, and self-esteem) and self-actualization, which is the individual finding personal fulfillment, self-growth and their understanding of the meaning of their life. These last categories underline the gay rights revolution. Gay rights were not about access to markets; a closeted gay could still access markets even in a prejudicial culture. It was hard, however, to be closeted yet still have self-esteem and self-growth. Once lower-order needs were out of the way, people clamored for those choices in life that make them individuals -- different from others. Economic prosperity creates that demand by filling the lower-order needs. While economic reform is necessary for economic prosperity, it is social reform that is necessary for individuals to live as free individuals.Many have damned liberal economic reforms because they encourage individualism, the theory being that individualism promotes an uncaring, socially isolated, atomistic culture. Yet studies find that ""the tolerance level of the average American has been climbing steadily since the early 1970s."" The reason that tolerance has increased is precisely because people became more individualistic in how they perceive themselves and others: The increase in tolerance co-occurred with increases in individualistic beliefs such as rejecting traditional social rules around gender, race, religion, sexuality, and drug use. At the group level, tolerance was higher in years with more individualistic language in books and a higher need for uniqueness. These analyses cannot infer causation, but these results are consistent with our hypothesis that increasingly individualistic attitudes may be one cause of increasing tolerance for outgroups.Rising economic prosperity encourages individualism. With the rise of individualism, it becomes harder and harder to damn those ""not like us."" There is no ""us"" anymore, just many individuals, each with different values and priorities. Intolerance is largely fear of individualism; once you prosper economically, the individualistic genie is out of the bottle, and social change inevitably follows. Depoliticized markets ought to terrify conservatives, for in them social change is born."

From an American standpoint, his ongoing efforts to intensify cooperation with the region present new opportunities: In the realm of commerce, Morocco maintains a free trade agreement with the United States and is poised to serve as a gateway to Africa. In terms of security, the kingdom's partnership with African states in the struggle against terrorism provides a framework for enhanced cooperation with Washington. Moroccan King Mohammed VI arrives in the Senegalese capital Dakar Reports on the visit thus far has stressed growing business ties between Africa and its Southern neighbors, the transfer of skills, projects to improve governance, and the development of infrastructure. They point to improved rates of economic growth for most of the countries involved. But there is another dimension to engaging the continent without which all these opportunities will be missed: Sustainable development in the African south is inextricable from social issues. The continent's talented populations and vast youth demographic have the potential to make the continent a global powerhouse -- but not unless present-day ills are healed. Ethnic and sectarian divisions threaten to tear apart some of the most important economies. Consider Nigerione of the largest countries in the world -- with a polity so troubled and a state so dysfunctional that it turns to one of the poorest countries in the world, Chad, to help counter terrorism within its borders. The latest report by UNESCO, in considering the situation in sub-Saharan Africa with respect to the objectives of the ""Education for All"" agenda, draws heartbreaking conclusion: The region includes sixteen of the 20 countries ranked lowest in terms of progress over the past 15 years. Meanwhile, women's status is deteriorating in some countries. Health services in parts of the region do not meet the basic needs of their populations -- as the world discovered during the Ebola outbreak. More mundane tragedies happen every day, like infant mortality and the death of mothers at childbirth. Other tragedies have been diagnosed as stemming from religious taboos and conservative social norms: In 2008, of the millions of abortions performed in Africa, according to the World Health Organization, only 3% were performed with proper medical care. Thus human development is a central component and a prime directive for progress in Africa.In the years coinciding with King Mohammed VI's reign, a growing number of countries in the region have shown an interest in learning from the Moroccan experience on all these fronts. They are apparently responding to the kingdom's National Human Development Initiative (NHDI), which recently celebrated its tenth anniversary. In an effort to improve the status of nearly 10 million poor Moroccans, half of whom live in rural areas, $6 billion have been invested to date, in support of more than 719 anti-poverty measures and projects. On a recent visit to Morocco, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon dubbed the Initiative an import ant model for other African countries seeking to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Accordingly, numerous governments on the continent today are negotiating the transfer of experience for Morocco, seeking to adapt the method to suit their needs. For example, an agreement between Morocco and Gabon has been signed to institutionalize the exchange of experience between the NHDI and the nascent ""Human Investment strategy in Gabon"" (SIHG). In terms of health services, the monarch has shown solidarity with his Southern neighbors -- and signaled the desire for heightened South-South cooperation -- by launching a host of programs to assist disadvantaged populations in Africa. A substantial donation of medicine and medical devices was made to one of the main hospitals in Dakar, for example -- a day after the signing of a series of bilateral cooperation agreements, strengthens the human and social dimension of the Moroccan-Senegalese partnership.Africa can be an engine of global growth, economists say -- but not without placing people at the center of development efforts. By engaging Morocco in its ambitious efforts to support and engage the African South, the United States can help ensure that the region achieves its potential."

All three officials in the end merely waving ""Good Night"" when anxiously asked to comment on what progress was made during their two-hour talks. A classic disappointment all around. From the moment the EU began implementing an unorthodox strict-austerity adjustment program for Greece after ""securing"" a total financial aid package of €240b from the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB.Both sides have since displayed a remarkable lack of professionalism: ignoring internationally protected human rights standards first; and, second, turning also a blind eye to the grave financial and economic damage their poorly researched program, enforced by Greece's creditors, was bound to entail. Not to mention the inevitable opportunity costs created in the process.As it happens, the enjoyment of fundamental human rights -- and more particularly the economic, social and cultural rights of the Greek people -- has been undermined as a result by violating existing obligations protected primarily by the Constitution of Greece, Article 2(1) postulating that ""respect and protection of the value of the human being constitutes the primary obligation of the state"".Also abusing, however, standards set out in core international human rights treaties. Including the Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that characteristically binds international financial institutions with a mandatory obligation. Namely, to ensure that their policies and activities respect established human rights standards by not adopting or promoting policies, or engage in practices, that put at risk the enjoyment of human rights. Nothing could have been clearer for the trio of lenders here to understand -- from day one.Nonetheless, Europe's ""blind austerity"" program went ahead defiantly adopting successive deep spending cuts, drastically eliminating jobs in the public sector, coupled with consecutively compulsive increases in direct and indirect taxation -- prematurely emphasizing structural changes such as privatizations and labor market reforms with arbitrary cuts across the board of salaries and pensions. This bouquet of heavy even aggressive compulsion has directly contributed to a steadily collapsing aggregate effective demand in the Greek economy - a growing insufficiency of which has been for years pushing the country deeper into merciless recession asymptotically converging at present to a 50 percent drop of GNP.This anomaly is currently reflected in exponential rises in unemployment in Greece, especially of younger persons, along with steadily rising homelessness and spreading poverty now threatening a humanitarian crisis already compromising the social cohesion of a member-state of the European Union. So, one wonders, how is it possible that contemporary Europe should also remain indifferent even at the point where thousands of ordinary tax-paying citizens in the country, since that fateful day in April 2010, are known to have committed suicide in utter desperation?The suggestion, recently put forward by Paul Krugman in the International New York Times, that ""we live in an age of unacknowledged errors"", seems instructive here. Considering that a likely profitable alternative policy, ceremoniously announced by the European Commission, back in 2011, was in the end quietly cast aside in favor of the controversial ""bailout"" adjustment program in question. Far more reasonable, the idea originally was to launch in lieu a series of mainly labor-intensive ""pilot projects."" Jointly promoted with the Greek government, but also designed to attract worldwide interest to invest in the infra-structure of the country. Correctly aiming to revive confidence, step by step, and gradually normalizing the financial and economic landscape in Greece: indeed a relatively small country easier to put back on track.Driven, however, by the demonstrably poor direction subsequently chosen instead, the Eurogroup finance ministers, typically destitute of vision again in Brussels this month, were still pushing headlong for more structural reforms in Greece. With a view to modernizing public administration, liberalizing trade, ""opening-up"" regulated professions, further ensuring greater labor market flexibility, and so on. All these, needless to add, being desirable initiatives no doubt. But which, of course, would make sense only in different circumstances: more responsibly aiming to help Greece emerge faster from the crisis.What should have already happened, first and foremost, precisely in order for the country to become capable to forge ahead with these and more reforms, was the scaling-down in real terms (though also as a moral imperative) of the country's bulging nearly unserviceable debt today. Adjusted downwards to reflect the massive damage incurred in financial, economic and human terms from the very day the so-called adjustment program for Greece emerged in April 2010.Such a key rectification would naturally have established the remaining sovereign debt of Greece as €150b. A pivotal contribution, indeed, bound to create unparalleled enthusiasm in Greece for widespread reform. In remarkable contrast to today's obsessive stalemate with only bits and pieces of occasional progress made here and there. This figure is consistent with privately conducted professional estimates so far -- as, for example, from the Julius Bar and Mitsubishi banks -- in Europe and elsewhere. Significantly down, too, from the €350b level inaccurately presumed to be the case today.And so, why not consider bringing this whole festering situation before a specially-convened European conference or synod to settle by arbitration this destabilizing issue? The United States is eminently poised today to offer its services and goodwill for mediation -- highly appropriate at this stage -- following the US Treasury Department's intensified and widely acknowledged efforts in recent months to dampen hostility and unnecessary confrontation between the two sides. Greece needs an honest break to get ahead: by completing ex post all known far-reaching structural reforms required to help transform its economy -- languishing in disarray for too long -- into an engine of progress. Securing in the end sustained economic growth serving best the rightful interests of the Greek people.A just and realistic settlement will also help restore the reputation of Greece's creditors."

A further 300 soldiers were killed in fighting before the city was captured, according to the monitoring group.Islamic State reinforced Ramadi on Monday, deploying fighters in preparation for battle against security forces and paramilitary groups advancing on the provincial capital.Iraqi forces have regained ground east of the city since launching a counter-offensive on Saturday, a week after it was overrun by the insurgents, and on Monday retook a rural area south of the city.Police sources said Iraqi security forces supported by Iran-backed Shi'ite militia groups and locally recruited Sunni tribal fighters had retaken parts of al-Tash, 20 km (12 miles) south of Ramadi, which lies only a short distance from Baghdad.Ramadi residents said trucks carrying Islamic State fighters arrived on Sunday evening before spreading out across the city.Local man Abu Saed heard a commotion outside his house in the city's southeastern Officers neighborhood. ""I saw two trucks pull up outside with dozens of fighters carrying arms running quickly into nearby buildings and taking cover.""Another resident said at least 40 fighters had jumped out of three trucks that arrived in the southern al-Tamim district at around 8 pm on Sunday. ""They were carrying weapons and wearing mostly khaki dress with ammunition belts wrapped around their chests,"" said Abu Mutaz. ""They were talking in an Arabic dialect, they were not Iraqis.""MAJOR SETBACKThe fall of Ramadi is the most significant setback for Iraqi forces in almost a year and has cast doubt on the effectiveness of a U.S.-led strategy for fighting the Sunni militant group.The seizures of Ramadi and Palmyra were the group's biggest successes since a U.S.-led coalition launched an air war against it last year.The near simultaneous victories against the Iraqi and Syrian armies have forced Washington to examine its strategy, which involves bombing from the air but leaving fighting on the ground to local forces.In a sharp criticism of Washington's ally, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter accused the Iraqi army of abandoning Ramadi to a much smaller enemy force. ""The Iraqi forces just showed no will to fight,"" he told CNN's State of the Union program on Sunday.The general in charge of Iran's paramilitary activities in the Middle East meanwhile said the United States and other powers were failing to confront Islamic State.""Today, in the fight against this dangerous phenomenon, nobody is present except Iran,"" said Major General Qassem Soleimani, who is often seen on the battlefields of Iraq.But in a move that could mark an expansion of U.S. involvement in the conflict, Turkey said it and the United States had agreed in principle to give air support to some forces from Syria's mainstream opposition.Days after taking Ramadi, Islamic State also defeated Syrian government forces to capture Palmyra, home to 50,000 people and site of some of the world's most extensive and best-preserved Roman ruins.The Sunni Muslim militants have proclaimed a caliphate to rule over all Muslims from territory they hold in Syria and Iraq. They have carried out mass killings in towns and cities they have captured, and destroyed ancient monuments, which they consider evidence of paganism.In Syria, Hezbollah fighters captured two hilltops from al Qaeda's Syria wing Nusra Front in areas close to the Lebanese border and killed dozens of enemy combatants, Hezbollah-run al-Manar television reported on Monday.Iranian-backed Hezbollah has backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war. The group's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, has vowed to clear the border area of Sunni Muslim militant groups that have carried out attacks on Lebanese soil.

I am struck by the nature, the very essence of memory and what it really means, what it can achieve and the flip side -- the deep harm it can catalyze.Coming from a family with a tradition of military service -- my grandfather in WWI, my uncle in WWII and my father in the Korean Conflict -- the day actually is a poignant one, redolent with parades and flags and stories culminating in the family BBQ.Today, across the U.S., it is more known for the big sales events on everything from cars to socks, which add up to a memory component not unlike a Snapchat picture. Now you see it; now you don't.Having said that, though, I have noticed a rise in premium video content programing (TV) around U.S. soldiers and their commitments and their sacrifices, which I attribute in part to the success of American Sniper and other movies of that genre -- which I imagine led the analysts to an insight that people might just be interested in those memories....Last year I asked ""Have We Forgotten How to Remember?"" the implication being that in a world where anything and everything I need to know is nothing more than a click or swipe away, will the very notion of memory change? And if so, what does that mean for us emotionally as human beings?So what is memory... really?Etymologically, the modern English word ""memory"" comes to us from the Middle English memorie, which in turn comes from the Anglo-French memoire or memorie, and ultimately from the Latin memoria and memor, meaning ""mindful"" or ""remembering.""Mindful or remembering...I kind of like the mindful reference, as it seems more active -- memory makes us mindful, which is further illuminated by one of the definitions from MedicalDictionary.com:""Persistent modification of behavior resulting from experience.""Deepak Chopra builds on this theme and expresses it in a surprisingly marketing-oriented way -- marketers take note.... Listen:Karma is experience, and experience creates memory, and memory creates imagination and desire, and desire creates karma again. If I buy a cup of coffee, that's karma. I now have that memory that might give me the potential desire for having cappuccino, and I walk into Starbucks, and there's karma all over again.Makes you wonder about the efficacy of so-called real-time predictive targeting -- in fact, AOL recently published Buying at Speed, a study of 20,000 online shoppers that showed people browse brands every day and make up their minds before conscious shopping begins -- by the time data-directed marketing begins, they've already decided meaningful memory -- Karma to Desire.... ""For 54 percent of planned purchases and 50 percent of impulse purchases, buyers knew the brand they would buy before they shopped.""It is also fascinating to quantify the human ability to remember by comparing it to what I imagine most of us think of as the ultimate benchmark -- computers -- and to my way of thinking the data or rather the conflicting data is fascinating and illuminating...On one hand some say that the total storage capacity we have in our heads is at best a quarter of the power in an external hard drive that can be bought for under a $100US. Don't know about you -- that did not make me feel very special, also considering it was on sale for Memorial Day.On the other hand -- and this is the key -- because of the complexity of our neurons, because of the serendipity of our human state, our true memory storage capacity might be according to something more akin to 2.5 petabytes (a million gigabytes) or enough to hold three million hours of video, which is equal to running a continuous stream for about 300 years... Now that made me feel macho (in a non gender sense, for the PC) and more worthy in the human vs. machine debate.And by the way, we are also efficient -- we power all that capacity with a mere 12 watt equivalent. Would a machine even be able to achieve that much storage? It would require the electrical equivalent of a city to keep it running... GO HUMANITY.So we have all this power; we have all this capacity; we have Deepak's karma leading to desire leading to karma again -- what do we do with it? How do we leverage it? How do we make the world a better place...And therein lies the challenge...Think about events all over the world -- where memory -- that is recollection of an event -- has caused nothing but turmoil, sometimes hate and way too often death....Just look at the United States in the past two years and the growing racial strife over police and their actions.Follow the debate over just what did the Pope say or not say to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.Staying in the Middle East - memory fuels more hatred and violence than almost anywhere in the world...between people of the same religion who remember slights of centuries ago as well as between neighbors who view the same event through two different memory glasses...Yet we have recovered from WWII and former enemies are now staunch allies, and I have written about Vietnam, where a war of not so long ago is remembered but as leverage to build on and move forward from.And at best our memories are faulty -- flawed -- subject to mind creep and other intrusions....So where does that leave us?I am back to the human condition and our need to understand that algorithms alone do not solve the problems of the world, cannot replace or replicate the human factor, will never be the panacea needed to right what's wrong.We need to work on human memory -- and whether it's in business where we need to link the ""karma and desire"" or in our personal lives where we need to learn that our memories are often faulty -- at best - and even so should be understood as ""mindful"" -- a guide if you will -- not the be-all and end-all.And yet, what are we without memory? What are our endeavors without memory? Who are we without memory?Listen:Without memory, there is no culture. Without memory, there would be no civilization, no society, no future. Elie WieselAnd there you have it -- the two-edged sword -- because so much memory seems to be leading us down a dark path....Time for us to take memory in hand -- understand its power, respect its limitations, leverage its strengths and beware of its danger....So on Memorial Day, I will be taking my imperfect and flawed memory in hand -- shop a sale or two -- and do my best to control my little part of what might be our greatest contribution to the world...our memories....What do you think?"
