Mia McLeod (D-Columbia), would require men to wait 24 hours between when they receive a prescription for an erectile dysfunction drug and when they could obtain it. Women in South Carolina must wait 24 hours before receiving an abortion. The bill would also require men to get a signed affidavit from a partner confirming he has erectile dysfunction, see a sex therapist and undergo additional health tests, WCBD reported.Women in South Carolina must receive counseling before they receive an abortion and parents of minors younger than 17 must sign a consent form before an abortion is performed, according to the Guttmacher Institute.McLeod told WCBD that she doesn't expect the bill to pass, but wants to use it as an opportunity to highlight how difficult it is for women to get an abortion in South Carolina.“I purposely tried to make it as invasive, as intrusive, as hypocritical, and unnecessary as possible to make the point,” she told the station. “I mean, we’re in a male-dominated legislature, of course, and I really just want to broaden the discussion and get people thinking about and talking about some of the issues that women face who are seeking legal abortion services in this state.”This isn't the first time that lawmakers have used abortion regulations as a model for regulations on erectile dysfunction drugs. Last month a Missouri lawmaker also proposed regulating those drugs like abortions in her state. The lawmaker, Missouri state Rep. Stacey Newman (D-St. Louis), similarly said that she didn't expect the legislation to pass, but wanted to use it as a way to highlight the hypocricy between how womens' bodies and guns are regulated.Also on HuffPost:"

4,POLITICS,Net Neutrality Survives Year-End Spending Fight,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/net-neutrality-spending-bill_us_56719c08e4b0648fe301c8b5,A GOP provision to kill net neutrality was not included in legislation to keep the government funded.,2015-12-16,A GOP provision to kill net neutrality was not included in the year-end government spending bill released Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_0_4896_2599%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democratic negotiators blocked a GOP provision to kill net neutrality from a year-end government spending bill released just after 1 a.m. Wednesday, allowing the Federal Communications Commission to go forward in enforcing open Internet rules.Republicans initially tucked the anti-net neutrality rider into one of the appropriations bills that congressional negotiators then had to put together into an omnibus bill to keep the government running.The current stopgap funding measure expires Wednesday night. Lawmakers are expected to pass another short-term measure before then, to keep the government running until Dec. 22, while they work on passing the $1.1 trillion omnibus bill. A vote on that will likely come Friday, and that package would keep the government open until October 2016.""Democratic leaders joined hands and fought hard not only to remove the net neutrality riders but to increase funds for the FCC to keep fighting for consumers,"" said a Democratic leadership aide who was not authorized to speak on record.On Feb. 26, the FCC approved strong net neutrality rules that reclassify consumer broadband as a utility under Title II of the Communications Act. In other words, it bans ""paid prioritization,"" a practice allowing Internet service providers to charge content producers a premium for giving users more reliable access to that content.Open Internet advocates were lobbying lawmakers to drop the rider from the final omnibus bill, as opponents became nervous that it would stick around.The Republican majority will almost certainly need a fair number of Democratic votes to pass the omnibus bill. Those prospects are brighter since riders that would have tightened screening for Syrian and Iraqi refugees and defunded Planned Parenthood were not included. Late Tuesday night, lawmakers also unveiled a second massive bill that would extend about 50 tax breaks set to expire at the end of the year. It would cost more than $700 billion over 10 years, and House Democratic leaders have already criticized it.Also on HuffPost:"
5,POLITICS,Mitch McConnell Loses Campaign Finance Budget Fight,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/omnibus-budget-campaign-finance_us_56718ab1e4b0688701dbb4f9,But efforts to increase disclosure of dark money also took a hit.,2015-12-16,Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not succeed in attaching a provision to the omnibus budget bill that would lift limits on party-candidate coordination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56718e341f00002d00e9be77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A controversial proposal to allow unlimited financial coordination between candidates and political parties that was pushed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) did not make it into the end-of-year omnibus budget bill.The proposal to lift limits on party-candidate coordination was opposed by both congressional Democrats and conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus. The opposition was led by Democratic Reps. John Sarbanes (Md.) and Ted Deutch (Fla.) and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.).“We are thankful to leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, reform advocates John Sarbanes and Dick Durbin, as well as White House staff for their efforts on these campaign finance riders,"" William Roberts, federal legislative director for the pro-campaign finance reform group Every Voice Center, said in a statement.But other provisions blocking campaign finance enforcement did make it into the bill.The Securities and Exchange Commission was banned from using any funds to establish a new rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose contributions they have made to politically active groups, including nonprofits that do not currently disclose such contributions.Campaign finance reform organizations and Wall Street reform groups have pushed hard to get this rule enacted at the SEC. Their efforts had been blocked by chairwoman Mary Jo White, an Obama appointee, but are now further stymied by the restrictions Congress has placed in the omnibus.The omnibus bill also bans the Internal Revenue Service from issuing rules requiring disclosure from 501(c)(4) nonprofits engaged in politics. Groups such as these, including Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS and the billionaire Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on election efforts without disclosing their donors since the Citizens United decision.Another rider attached to the budget bans President Barack Obama from issuing an executive order requiring government contractors to disclose their political spending, including donations to nonprofit groups engaged in elections, as a condition of submitting a bid. As The Huffington Post has previously reported, this language keeps alive the prospect of an executive order mandating disclosure from contractors after they have secured their contract.The survival of Obama's ability to issue some kind of executive order increasing disclosure is the lone bright spot for those who want to bring undisclosed or ""dark"" money in elections into the light.“The attacks on creating a more transparent democracy included in the bill make it even more urgent for President Obama to issue an executive order on disclosure,"" Marge Baker, executive vice president of People for the American Way, said in a statement. ""It’s clear that Republicans in Congress will do anything to stand in the way of Americans being able to see who is trying to buy influence in our democracy. It’s up to the president to act.”A last-minute effort to include a provision that would have ended the federal presidential public financing system and used the remaining money in its account to help pay for the cost of the Democratic and Republican conventions in 2016 was left out of the bill. The campaign finance reform groups that opposed this proposal hope to fix the public financing system and not gut it by draining its funds.The successful effort to prevent the inclusion of both McConnell’s party-candidate coordination rider and the gutting of the presidential public financing fund came after pro-reform groups were shocked by the inclusion of a rider in the 2014 omnibus budget bill that dramatically increased contribution limits to parties. That 2014 provision was the handiwork of Senate Republican and Democratic leadership, and engendered opposition from House Democratic leadership, the House Freedom Caucus and outside groups supporting campaign finance reforms.In a letter to the House Democratic caucus after the passage of the 2014 omnibus bill, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi noted her disgust with the measure. ""The inclusion of the outrageous campaign contribution provision gives further evidence of the need for campaign finance reform, and an opportunity for advancing initiatives to empower small donors and all American voters,” Pelosi said.Sarbanes, who led this year's effort to beat back the McConnell rider, says that Democrats who oppose efforts to roll back campaign finance limits learned from the 2014 episode. He made sure Democrats were prepared to voice their opposition to these amendments and that leadership would actively work to exclude them from a bill.""The difference between this year and last year is we got organized and got organized early,"" Sarbanes said."

The clip comes from a radio segment recorded on Jan. 31, 1939, and first and foremost, it cannot be ignored how hilarious everyone sounds. Seriously, listen to this clip.On top of the old-school radio voices, we do get a nice little story from the main man himself about the first game of basketball ever played, which sounded like complete and violent chaos (emphasis ours):Naismith: It was in the winter of 1891 when I was physical instructor at Springfield College in Massachusetts. We had a real New England blizzard. For days, the students couldn’t go outdoors. So they began roughhousing in the halls. We tried everything to keep them quiet. We tried playing a modified form of football in the gymnasium, but they got bored with that. Something had to be done. One day, I had an idea. I called the boys to the gym, divided them up into teams of nine and gave them an old soccer ball. I showed them two peach baskets I’d nailed up at each end of the gym and I told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team's peach basket. I blew a whistle and the first game of basketball began.Well then. Also on HuffPost:"

It’s important for us to fight for what we believe is right, because then it gives other teams and other countries the confidence to maybe do the same.

And she provided a preview of the U.S. team's road to the 2016 Rio Olympics, which the Americans will enter as two-time defending gold medal winners.She also spoke about the growth of women's soccer after the U.S. team's World Cup victory, which helped lead to record crowds across the fledgling National Women's Soccer League, and the importance of improving compensation and other benefits for players in the NWSL, which is entering its fourth season.""We’re not just fighting for things for ourselves, we’re fighting for the big picture,"" she said. ""There’s some players making $1,000 a month. ... We want other players to be able to fully focus on this and not have another job in the offseason. That’s what we want to get at.""Plus, Daily Beast and New York Times Magazine columnist Ana Marie Cox joins Travis and Donté to ponder what might have been had Donald Trump bought the Buffalo Bills instead of running for president, unfortunate incidents of Islamophobia at recent NFL games, and surging teams that could shake up the NFL playoff picture with just a few weeks left in the season.This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Peter James Callahan and Adriana Usero, with assistance from Christine Conetta.

8,POLITICS,Americans' Biggest Fears Aren't About Gun Violence Or Terrorism,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/terrorism-gun-violence-fears-poll_us_567090d9e4b0dfd4bcbfce99,"Unlike most presidential candidates, Americans are more concerned about getting sick or losing a job.",2015-12-16,"An American flag flies at half mast.

The event opened with moderator Wolf Blitzer declaring a focus on ""keeping the country safe"" -- a topic that came up more than 50 times throughout the night.In the weeks since the attack in San Bernardino, California, presidential hopefuls on both sides of the aisle have been addressing a presumably terrified nation, from Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) describing the national mood as ""really scared and worried, to Hillary Clinton telling Iowans that ""it's O.K. to be afraid."" Donald Trump, perhaps more than any other candidate, has based his campaign on an appeal to xenophobia.It's not clear, however, that the public is all that acutely afraid.There's no question that the most recent shooting, falling against a grim backdrop of frequent gun violence at home and terrorism overseas, has left the public shaken. The share of Americans naming terrorism as the country's most important problem is higher than it's been in a decade, according to Gallup, with concerns about guns and gun control also on the rise.""I am very careful taking my small children into large crowds or celebrations - particularly those celebrations of our faith,"" said one mother surveyed in a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, which finds that a fifth of Americans have changed their lives in the last year because of concerns about gun violence or terrorism.Another respondent said she'd stopped going to shopping malls, movie theaters or ""anywhere there are big crowds,"" while others ticked off lists of self-imposed restrictions ranging from the all-encompassing to the acutely specific. ""I don't go out alone and I don't go out at night,"" one said. Another wrote: ""I won't go to a mall. Will not fly in a plane. Will not visit Europe.""A few share the attitudes that led to gun sales spiking in the wake of many high-profile shootings. ""[I] purchased handguns and a shotgun and learned how to use them defensively,"" wrote one 58-year-old man, who said he was very scared about the way things are going in the world today, including the possibility that his family would be affected either by gun violence or by terrorism.But his level of anxiety, the HuffPost/YouGov survey suggests, is distinctly in the minority.Most Americans describe themselves as, at most, ""somewhat"" scared by the way things are going in the world. Just 13 percent say they worry a great deal that they or someone in their family will be a victim of gun violence; an equal percentage are equally concerned that they or someone in their family will become a victim of terrorism.Asked to pick their two biggest worries for themselves and their families, 42 percent of Americans said they most fear someone will suffer a serious illness or injury. Forty-one percent feared that they or a loved one would lose a job or have financial problems.In comparison, just over a quarter are most worried that they or a family member would be victimized by gun violence or a terror attack.Those fears aren't all equally distributed.Republicans find terrorism more alarming than gun violence, while Democrats believe the opposite. Women worry more than men about violence, and illness concerns older Americans far more than the young. Twenty percent of black Americans, compared to just 2 percent of whites, name police brutality as among their biggest fears. Across party lines, though, Americans' most pressing personal worries aren't the jolting events that have dominated recent headlines, but the more everyday struggles for economic and physical health. And whatever current events intervene in the time before next year's election, those concerns are likely to stick around.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 7-10 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).About $3.5 billion will be designated for the World Trade Center Health Program, guaranteeing that more than 72,000 known responders and survivors will always have access to treatment, including more than 33,000 who already have 9/11-linked illnesses. The program will last 75 years, until 2090.Another $4.6 billion will go to extend the 9/11 Victims Compensation Program for five more years, and fill an approximately 50 percent funding shortfall in the original program passed in 2010.“Now those who rushed to the towers will know that if they get sick because of their bravery, the federal government will be there for them the way they were there for us,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday. ""It took too long, but Congress finally rose to its responsibility to help our heroes."" A separate standalone bill, which would have permanently funded both programs, attracted more than 270 sponsors in the House and 69 sponsors in the Senate. But it was never brought forward for its own vote.Instead, committees in both chambers of Congress decided to put together their own measures, which subsequently got bogged down in horse-trading and political negotiations.One of the funding streams used for the 9/11 compensation fund will also provide over $1 billion to compensate U.S. victims of the Iran hostage crisis, the 1983 attacks on the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon and the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. That was a key goal of House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.).The authorization for the trade center health program expired at the end of September, leaving it to operate on leftover funds while responders suffering physical and psychological effects from their service had to wait and see whether Congress would fail them.Advocates and the ailing responders themselves had to make more than 20 trips to Capitol Hill, spending over two months visiting Washington in total. They also had to enlist the backing of former ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart to shame the nation’s legislature into action. Stewart made two lobbying trips to Congress along with responders toting oxygen tanks and wheelchairs.“Our 9/11 first responders never should have been forced to travel to Washington and walk the halls of Congress -- legislation this important shouldn’t have needed so much convincing,” said Gillibrand, the measure's lead sponsor in the Senate. “They finally got the job done and convinced Congress to fulfill its moral obligation to our 9/11 heroes. I’m proud to represent them, and I’m grateful for their efforts.”The major battles were focused on the question of how the bill would be paid for, with a number of the sponsors' offers being rejected. Ultimately the bill used funding that had been earmarked for other measures that were running into opposition.Congress still has to pass the spending bill, but Republican leaders expect that to happen by Thursday.""It has been a tough fight, and it has been a long fight, but it has been worth it,"" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who has been working on 9/11 legislation since the 2001 attacks.""We will never fully repay the sacrifice these men and women made following Sept. 11,"" she said. ""All they ask of us is that we never forget their sacrifice -- and Congress is now sending a clear message back: We haven’t.""For readers who are familiar with the old program, here are some of the changes in the new version. According to a fact sheet on the measure, the legislation:- Adds a requirement that the Administrator provide for an independent peer review of the scientific and technical evidence prior to adding a condition to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions.The extended Victim Compensation Fund will see the following changes:- All applicants that received an award determination letter before the day of enactment will receive the full amount of their award.Matt Fuller contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost:"

15,POLITICS,States Celebrating Hospitality With Nativity Scenes Want To Turn Away Syrian Refugees,Ryan Grim and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nativity-scenes-refugees_us_566f40a2e4b011b83a6c3e9c,WWJD?,2015-12-15,Nativity scenes are going up in several state capitols.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_27_2000_1162%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Around two thousand and sixteen years ago, a non-Christian Middle Eastern couple was in need of refuge for the night. There was no room at the inn, but the innkeeper dug deep into his humanity and offered the travelers, one of whom was pregnant with another Man's child, the option of bedding down in the barn. It was there that Jesus Christ was born.The scene of the Nativity is recreated throughout the world every December. You can find it in malls, on the front lawns of churches, in dioramas and on clothing. It is an annual celebration of hospitality and its infinite, sacred possibility.At least five states are bringing that spirit to their people by displaying Nativity scenes in the governor's mansions or state capitol buildings. While a chained-up sheep might be welcome under Georgia's rotunda, however, today's Middle Eastern refugees are not. Georgia, Illinois, Nebraska and Texas will have Nativity scenes in their state capitols, and Oklahoma will have one at the governor's mansion. The governors of those same five states have said they do not want any Syrian refugees coming to their states in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris. ""Our nation and our state have a shared history of providing safe haven for those displaced by conflict, but the news surrounding the Paris terror attacks reminds us of the all-too-real security threats facing America,"" Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) said last month.None of the governors' offices returned a request for comment on whether the story of Christmas holds any lessons for how to deal with the current refugee situation. The Thomas More Society, a public interest law firm that is co-sponsoring the Nativity scenes, also declined to comment about modern-day refugees. Spokesman Tom Ciesielka said the Nativity scenes were ""primarily about free speech in public forum-type locations.""Back 2,016 years ago, the family of Christ was at even greater risk after their son was born in the barn. ""When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. 'Get up,' he said, 'take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him,'"" Matthew would later report. The refugees fled to Egypt. Violence eventually caught up with Christ, who was brutally executed -- a fate that has befallen thousands of Syrians of all religions and awaits many more who will be unable to escape.Some opponents of welcoming Syrian refugees have already rejected any comparison between the story of Christmas and current times.""Mary and Jesus didn't have suicide bomb vests strapped on them, and these folks do,"" Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) said recently. ""You can see it in technicolor in Paris.""So far, however, not a single one of the Paris attackers has been identified as a Syrian refugee.Florida, another state that has rejected Syrian refugees, will not have a Nativity scene this year after groups protested it in past years by installing a Festivus pole made of beer cans, a ""Happy Winter Solstice"" banner and a Satanic temple diorama.Nebraska's Nativity scene will not be displayed during the week of Christmas because atheist groups reserved the capitol's floor space in advance.

16,POLITICS,Terrorism Is Now Americans' Top Concern,Mariam Baksh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/terrorism-poll_us_566ef831e4b011b83a6bee6d,Republicans are far more worried about terrorism than Democrats.,2015-12-15,"On Dec. 6, 2015 President Barack Obama spoke from the oval office to reassure the nation on the U.S. strategy to defeat ISIL.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566f2a6b1900002300789d6f.jpeg?ops=crop_0_69_4000_2210%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Terrorism has become the most important concern for Americans since the attacks on Paris and San Bernardino, California, surpassing even the economy, according to a new Gallup poll released Monday. The Gallup survey shows 16 percent of Americans now rate terrorism as the top challenge facing the country -- the highest percentage recorded by the pollsters in a decade. This represents an increase of 13 percentage points from a Gallup poll conducted in the wake of the Nov. 13 attacks on Paris, when the economy had the top spot with 17 percent.Republicans are the most worried about terrorism. Twenty-four percent of Republicans told Gallup that terrorism is the most important issue facing the country, while 15 percent of independents and 9 percent of Democrats said the same. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Monday found similar increased concern over terrorism. Four in 10 surveyed said national security and terrorism was the top issue the government needs to address, a 19-point increase from an April NBC/WSJ poll. The partisan divide also is apparent in the NBC/WSJ survey. Fifty-eight percent of Republican primary voters think national security and terrorism should be the top priority for government; only 26 percent of Democratic primary voters agreed. The last time terrorism was the nation's primary concern was following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when 59 percent of Americans said it was the most important issue. A poll conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute from Dec. 2 to Dec. 6 (after the attack in San Bernardino) found fear of terrorism to be at its highest rate since the weeks following the 9/11 attacks. Forty-seven percent of Americans said they are ""very or somewhat worried that they or someone in their family will be a victim of terrorism.""In the past, concerns about terrorism didn't break down so starkly along political lines. A Gallup poll conducted on the fifth anniversary of 9/11, when four in 10 Americans were most concerned about terrorism, found roughly equal numbers of Republicans (49 percent), independents (51 percent), and Democrats (51 percent) felt that a terrorist attack in the United States was imminent. Gallup surveyed 824 Americans Dec. 2 through Dec. 6. NBC/WSJ surveyed 1,000 Americans Dec. 6 through Dec. 9. Both surveys were conducted using live interviews on landlines and cellphones.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said a Pew poll conducted after the San Bernardino shooting found a fear of terrorism to be at its highest rate since the weeks following the 9/11 attacks. It was a Public Religion Research Institute poll.Also on HuffPost:"
