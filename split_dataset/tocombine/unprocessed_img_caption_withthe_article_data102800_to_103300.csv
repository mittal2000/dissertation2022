Modi will be India's next prime minister, winning the most decisive victory the country has seen in more than a quarter century and sweeping the long-dominant Congress party from power, results showed Friday. (AP Photo/Aijaz Rahi)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc141ca2400004f0024f9bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the current world of media, India stands as an anomaly. While newspapers in the United States have hemorrhaged profits in the past decade, with print-advertising revenues now at their lowest point since 1950, the situation in India couldn't be more different. The growth of digital and print media, the rise in revenues and the sheer amount of newspapers that circulate daily in the world's second-most populous nation all make for a striking picture. To help understand just how big this boom has been, and indeed why it's happening at all, here's a quick guide to India's complex media world.As of last year, India had more than 94,000 registered newspapers, according to a recent report by KPMG, an audit and advisory firm. Not only is that an amount that dwarfs the U.S. -- which as of 2011 had fewer than 14,000 registered newspapers -- but it's also a figure that has nearly doubled from just 10 years prior, when there were about 55,000 registered Indian papers.In the past year alone, revenues for newspapers in India experienced 8.7 percent growth, even as venerated institutions like The New York Times have continued to gut their newsrooms.Part of the reason for India's robust print industry is that in many parts of the country, especially the rural regions, Internet connectivity is still a development issue. Only 3 percent of Indians say they have home Internet access, in large part because of a lack of infrastructure. That's not to say that Indians aren't online -- just that many of them are getting access through wireless connections and mobile networks. According to the KPMG report, of the 214 million Internet users in India, 130 million, or about 61 percent, get access through mobile. The report predicts that mobile users will top 350 million by the end of 2018 -- about 71 percent of what is by then expected to be a total of 494 million Internet users.In January, The Guardian reported that 225 million smartphones were expected to be sold in India in 2014, with a greater proportion of those going to new users than anywhere else in the world. Those new Internet users may pose a problem for print, but to big media groups moving online, they're just potential customers via a different medium.A combination of factors have gotten India to this place. The first and most obvious is a growing population that's also increasingly literate. According to a 2012 study by UNESCO, India's literacy rate, which was less than 50 percent in 1990, is projected to be about 71 percent by 2015. That's by no means ideal from a development perspective, but in a country with 1.2 billion people, at the very least it means a dramatic increase in readers.""When someone is literate, the first thing he or she wants to do is to be able to read a newspaper,"" Magdoom Mohamed of the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers told The WorldPost, ""and show to the world that he or she reads a newspaper.""Mohamed pointed out that a lot of the media growth seen in India is coming from areas where Internet connectivity is low, and where news media is just starting to penetrate. ""The real growth in media, especially for the print media, is coming from medium and smaller towns in India,"" he wrote, ""where people are getting hooked to newspaper readership.""Vying to attract that growing readership are a number of established newspapers and media groups with a long history of publishing in English, Hindi and other languages. The Times of India, a partner of The Huffington Post for HuffPost India and currently the most widely circulated English-language paper in the world, has operated since the late 1830s. Other publications got their start not long after.As Ken Auletta noted in a 2012 New Yorker piece, with the increase of literacy and readership in the 1990s and 2000s, these long-standing media institutions developed ways to turn shifting social trends into profit. Instead of going for subscription money, however, many big newspapers lowered their prices, making their products extremely affordable and offering free delivery. The papers focused on ad revenue instead, selling mass volumes of ad space to companies eager to get their products in front of people's eyes.Here is where India's newspaper industry diverges from press practices in many other countries. Ad sales have always been a part of the media business, everywhere that media exists. But while U.S. media generally observes a ""church and state"" distinction between editorial content and advertising, that's not always the case in India. ""Advertorials"" -- that is, ads that are styled to look like normal news articles, with a tiny caveat explaining who sponsored them -- are extremely prevalent in Indian media. They're widespread in the U.S., too, though there's a lot of disagreement about how to implement them (and whether they should even be used at all). But some Indian news organizations go one step further. Scandals have erupted over so-called ""paid news,"" in which politicians or brands reportedly paid publications for positive coverage. The Indian government has condemned the practice.The possibilities for Indian media are enormous, but the industry's rapid growth hasn't come without challenges.The watchdog organization Freedom House notes that journalists in India face a variety of pressures, from legal action undertaken by the government to violent attacks and killings carried out by extremists, criminals and police. The Freedom House report also expresses concern over recent instances where ""the political interests of media owners"" have appeared to ""compromise the independence of their outlets.""As for ""paid news,"" Freedom House reports there has been a greater attempt to bring accountability to media coverage, with the Press Council of India investigating potential abuses.India's vast network of newspapers and online outlets provides an incredible means for telling important stories and reaching people across the country. As the country prepares to enter a new era of mobile, digital media consumption, it's a fascinating time to watch how the nature of news will change. "
2,FIFTY,Jane Seymour's Secrets To Feeling Young After 50,Yagana Shah,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jane-seymour-aging_n_6256918.html,,2014-12-07,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA - NOVEMBER 11: Actress Jane Seymour attends the premiere of the film 'Glen Campbell...I'll Be Me' at Pacific Design Center on November 11, 2014 in West Hollywood, California. (Photo by Michael Tullberg/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a8d54230000c100af4aca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SPECIAL FROM Grandparents.comActress and host of the new PBS series Feel Grand for people 50+, Jane Seymour (above middle, with her daughters and two grandchildren), talks about aging, plastic surgery, and how she gets the most out of life.“When I look at my actual chronological age, I’m in shock. I don’t feel like someone in my mid-60s,” says actress, artist and author Jane Seymour, 63, who is the host of the new health series Feel Grand on American Public Television. “I don’t behave like my parents did.” Seymour, a mother of six and grandmother of four, looks decades younger than her age, and makes it clear that how she looks has nothing to do with plastic surgery. “I don’t do Botox or Restylane. I’ve just decided to accept the aging process, and be as happy and healthy as I can for as long as I have the privilege of being here,” she says.So what exactly does Seymour do to keep herself feeling great physically and emotionally?1. Make up your mind. “I’ve come to the conclusion that aging is a mindset,” says Seymour. “Of course, the older you get, the more you have to do to stay healthy and well—like exercising a little bit every day and maybe dying your hair, but most important is making the decision to be as healthy and mobile and serene and appreciative as you can.”How to do it: Set aside a quiet time each day, even if it’s just for a few minutes, to think about yourself, how you feel, your goals and take time to appreciate for what you have.2. Surround yourself with younger friends. “I enjoy collaborating on projects with much younger people,” says Seymour. “They look at things differently than I do.” She also spends time with her children and grandchildren. “Spending time with them, I don’t feel cut off from what’s going on in the world, I actually feel very much a part of it,” she says.How to do it: Make a standing date to spend time with grandchildren, doing an activity of their choosing, whether it be baking cookies, playing video games or having them teach you something important to them.3. Keep your core strong. Seymour swears by Pilates and Gyrotonics, which are low-impact strengthening workouts. “However, just recently I tweaked my back and got a sudden reality check,” she says. “At this age, I listen to my body. It’s a mistake for me to do kickboxing or jog, which can hurt my knees and my joints, so I don’t do them and do other things instead.”How to do it: Get yourself back in the swing of exercising by walking with a friend. “There’s nothing like taking a one hour walk with someone you like to have a conversation with,” she says. “It clears the head and gets everything moving. Fast walking is even better. And swimming is the best.”4. Eat dessert. “I’ve always felt that moderation in everything works well,” says Seymour. She eats fresh organic produce that she grows in her yard. She’s also not adverse to having a glass of wine in the evening and coffee to start the day. “When I turned 30, I thought, ‘It’s ok, Jane, you can relax now and enjoy things.’ If I want a cookie or ice cream, I eat it,” she says.How to do it: Don’t deprive yourself, but do section out snacks or treats, so you only have one or two, not the whole bag.5. Forgive yourself and move forward. “Huge changes have happened in my life just recently and I’ve worked hard on accepting how things are and have tried to let go,” says Seymour. “Shame and regret don’t get you anywhere and can age you.” She compares life to a wave. “Things rise up—you’re born, grow up, have lots of accomplishments, but then things crash, too, with disappointments and obstacles, but everything always keeps moving. The wave skims the bottom, then rises up again.”How to do it: Seymour uses centered meditation to try to be in the present moment. “When it comes down to it, the healthiest thing you can do is be present every day, connect with other people, and share your love with family and friends.”6. Take care of your skin. ”Every night I take off my makeup really well,” Seymour says. “And I nourish my skin with a really good moisturizer, which doesn’t have to be expensive—sometimes the best products are the cheapest.”How to do it: Seymour believes drinking water is key. “I’m not against plastic surgery, but at the end of the day, I believe good skin comes form drinking water and moisturizing.” She also says there’s nothing like cold water andd ice cubes to tighten skin.7. Get creative. “Being creative is key to aging well,” she says. “Look at President Bush, who paints all the time. Winston Churchill painted, too.” Being creative allows you to express yourself in many different ways—which makes you feel good. “Sit down and write, try a musical instrument, take a ballroom dancing class,” she says. “What a lovely thing to do, expressing yourself while moving with another person.”How to do it: If you don’t know which activity to try, start with this: Use your smartphone to take one photo a day of the world around you. “You have your own unique view of the world around you, so document it!” she says.8. Do not isolate yourself. “Don’t feel that you have to be alone as you get older,’ says Seymour. “Create your own community. “How to do it: Feel like you have a purpose and help. Volunteer with a charity or organization, or get involved with other people who share your hobbies.Read more from Grandparents.com: 11 ways not to feel old 5 health benefits of aging 6 harmless habits that age you"

""We need to talk trillions, not billions (of dollars).""INDIGENOUS RIGHTSAt the same time, the human rights and security of communities who are the stewards of forests and other natural resources have to be ensured, he emphasized.More than 900 defenders of land rights and the environment are known to have died in 35 countries between 2002 and 2013, advocacy group Global Witness said in a report earlier this year.In September, Edwin Chota, a well-known environmental activist and Ashaninka tribal leader, was shot and killed along with three of his companions in a remote rainforest region near Peru's border with Brazil.Holmgren said there was no point in promoting landscape approaches if the local people involved ""still die fighting for their rights to advance (their) priorities.""Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, U.N. special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, said the best-kept forests in her country, the Philippines, are in indigenous territories where local people have title to their land.But globally, indigenous land rights have been significantly undermined, she added.""Unless we reach a stage where serious government efforts are targeted towards respect, protection and fulfillment of the rights of indigenous peoples, there will be a very difficult path towards a landscapes approach"" that provides benefits for all, she said.The World Bank's Kyte said the challenge now was to take anecdotal evidence of successful agriculture and forestry initiatives that protect people and their ecosystems - as in Brazil and parts of Rwanda, for example - and make it happen in whole regions.That would mean aligning agriculture and forest policy, land rights and land management, and giving small farmers access to credit, among other things, she said.Countries will come under growing pressure to do this ""as water resources start to become scarcer, and the need to produce nutritious food off less land becomes more intense, and as you start to see climate volatility,"" she added.(Reporting by Megan Rowling; editing by Laurie Goering)"

In the case of Britta Erickson, I have actually known her for over 35 years (we attended college together) and I really had no idea that she was writing until I reconnected with her on Facebook. As I have recently learned, Britta is an independent curator and scholar who lives for part of the year in Northern California, but who also spends a fair amount of time in China: she is the Artistic Director of a contemporary art gallery and experimental space called The Ink Studio in Beijing. It was Britta who introduced both the sponsor and organizer of the Ai Weiwei exhibit now on view at Alcatraz to the artist several years ago. Ai Weiwei with Britta EricksonAs becoming reacquainted with Britta has reminded me, each writer I know offers me an open door into their extended world, full of their most treasured ideas and images. Writers share what they find most valuable. In that spirit, I'm sharing 10 great books with you and paying it forward for the writers -- and artists -- who have created them. With each book I'm offering you a few lines of information and opinion in the form of a description and a micro-review.Zheng Chongbin: Impulse, Matter, Form (Contemporary Chinese Ink) By Britta Erickson and Zheng Chongbin Softcover, 192 pages, Published by Ink StudioDescription:Zheng Chongbin is an artist who works with traditional Chinese brushes, black ink and white acrylic on xuan paper. Shaped by the bicultural experience of studying and living in both the United States and China, his works fuse the language of traditional ink painting with the philosophical and practical concerns of Western Modernism. In the book's featured essay, Establishing Spirit in a Sea of Ink, Britta Erickson credits Chongbin with finding ""a new direction for art, with a new way forward for both abstraction and for ink."" This book also includes essays by Kenneth Wayne, Craig Yee, Amjad Majid and the artist. Micro-Review:A strikingly beautiful book that opens up a new set of possibilities for contemporary abstraction and for the continued dialogue between Eastern and Western aesthetic traditions. River of Ink: [An Illustrated History of Literacy] By Thomas Christensen Hardcover, 320 pages, Published by CounterpointDescription:A wide-ranging series of essays that are loosely connected by the theme of literacy: the book's title refers to the sacking of Baghdad in 1258 when the Tigris ran black with the ink of books flung into the water by Mongol invaders. Its essays traverse the world and time, from Prehistoric China to contemporary America. Its author views culture as a mirror and asserts that ""To explore other times and other cultures is really to explore our own time and our own culture...""Micro-Review: An eclectic and sporadically brilliant book in which an erudite writer takes his readers on a set of historical and cultural birdwalks. The essay ""Journeys of an Iron Man,"" which tells the story of a 19th century Benin iron sculpture of the god ""Gu"" -- the god of ironworking and warfare -- is a particularly informative and engaging read. Art Deco Hawai'i By Theresa Papanikolas and DeSoto Brown Softcover, 138 pages, Published by The Honolulu Museum of ArtDescription:Art Deco Hawai'i is the catalog for an exhibition at the Honolulu Museum of Art that will remain on view through January 11, 2015. Included in this book are paintings and sculpture by such artists as Don Blanding, Marguerite Blasingame, Robert Lee Eskridge, Isamu Noguchi, Agnes Lawrence Pelton, Gene Pressler, Lloyd Sexton, and Madge Tennent, and, at the center of them all, the six-mural cycle that Eugene Savage created for Matson in 1940.Micro-Review: A gorgeous and engaging book that documents the enchanting hybrid style that emerged when Parisian-born Art Deco came to dominate the fields of architecture, design and visual arts in Hawai'i in the 1920s, '30s and '40s. The catalog's main essays ""The Exotics of Leisure: Art Deco in Hawai'i"" by Theresa Papanikolas and ""Art Deco in Hawai'i Modernity and Tradition in Commercial Art"" by DeSoto Brown are superb. Art in America 1945-1970: Writings from the Age of Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, and Minimalism Edited by Jed Perl Hardcover, 886 pages, Published by The Library of AmericaDescription:This book is a compendium of primary source materials on American art. It includes major critical essays by Clement Greenberg, Susan Sontag, Hilton Kramer, and other influential figures. There are also responses to art by poets and novelists, including John Ashbery on Andy Warhol, James Agee on Helen Levitt, James Baldwin on Beauford Delaney, Truman Capote on Richard Avedon, Tennessee Williams on Hans Hofmann, Jack Kerouac on Robert Frank. Add to that, a selection of memoirs, diaries, and journalism by Peggy Guggenheim, Dwight Macdonald, Calvin Trillin, and others.Micro-Review: Jed Perl has done a major favor for those of us with a deep interest in American art. This book combines a lovingly selected cross-section of historically significant writings with helpful headnotes. Perl's scholarship is, to put it succinctly, awe-inspiring. Leonardo's Brain: Understanding Da Vinci's Creative Genius By Leonard Shlain Hardcover, 240 pages, Published by Lyons PressDescription:Leonardo's Brain opens with two interwoven strands of exposition: one deals with the life and works of Da Vinci while the other the evolution of the human brain. The book's final section then goes on to both explore the role of brain anatomy on creativity and to offer some notions about the evolutionary future of human neuro-anatomy. In total, it offers an ambitious conflation of biography, art history, and neuroscience layered with scientific and sociological conjecture. Micro-Review: Leonardo's Brain, published posthumously through the efforts of the author's three children -- Kimberly Brooks, Tiffany Shlain and Jordan Shlain -- is the magnum opus of prodigiously curious man with a larger-than-life intellect. It is rare and stimulating to find a book that locates so many profound and unexplored connections between art and science. Creating the Future: Art and Los Angeles in the 1970s By Michael Fallon Hardcover, 400 pages, Published by CounterpointDescription:Creating the Future is a work of social history/cultural criticism that examines the premise that the progress of art in Los Angeles ceased during the 1970s and didn't resume until sometime around 1984. Fallon takes a particular interest in the sheer variety of approaches and voices that appeared in the 1970s. Arranged into 12 themed chapters, it tells the stories of artists and their communities. Micro-Review: This book is a valuable record that captures the beginnings of a number of movements that later became tremendously influential including Feminist Art, Chicano Art and Lowbrow. Read it and plan on finishing with a more nuanced and insightful view of Los Angeles culture. Reading Basquiat: Exploring Ambivalence in American Art By Jordana Moore Saggese Hardcover, 268 pages, Published by the University of California PressDescription:Reading Basquiat offers a carefully constructed approach to Basquiat's themes and the impact of his practice. It does so by discussing his work in relationship to important aesthetic concerns including identity, appropriation and expressionism. Micro-Review: A deep and decidedly academic book that takes itself and its subject seriously. Its first chapter -- The Black Picasso: Jean-Michel Basquiat and Questions of Race -- offers insightful and overdue analyses of the complex ""black experiences"" that the artist's works both broadcast and embody. Behind the Easel: The Unique Voices of 20 Contemporary Representational Painters  by Robert C. Jackson Hardcover, 264 pages, Published by Schiffer Publishing Ltd. Description:Artist Robert C.

A great coffee table book for those who feel the nostalgic pull of the ""Cult of Progress."" The Figure: Painting, Drawing, and Sculpture Edited by Margaret McCann Hardcover, 240 pages, Published by Skira/RizzoliDescription:The Figure: Painting Drawing and Sculpture, Contemporary Perspectives has the look of a high-end coffee table decoration, but don't judge this book just by its Martha Mayer Erlebacher cover. Inside, you will find it crammed not only with striking images but also with essays by critics, artists, and other thinkers that air out thematically related historical, philosophical, theoretical, and technical issues. The Figure is an ambitious and overdue tome that fills a void: if you haven't noticed, contemporary representation is coming on strong. It is is also a celebration of the burgeoning influence of the New York Academy of Art (NYAA), a singular institution that has come into its own more than three decades after its establishment.Click here for my full review.Micro-Review:  If there ever was an art book that needed to become a major exhibition -- or a maybe a salon -- The Figure is it."

Amid the fallout from a grand jury's decision in the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Missouri, a panel in New York City is quietly nearing its own conclusion about another combustible case involving the death of an unarmed man at the hands of police. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2be8a240000310095e700.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the days after Ferguson, and just before the Garner decision, I spoke with a group of high school students about race and the criminal justice system. A young black teen in the audience asked a devastating question: ""How come we [the black community] always have to be the ones fatally shot?"" I was stunned and silenced by his question. He seemed to take for granted that black people would be shot by the police. And that all he could hope for was a world where black people would not be shot dead. His question dripped with hopelessness -- a thick, sticky hopelessness that felt near impossible to penetrate.We can talk all we want about provocation and perception. About chokeholds and grand juries. About the militarization of the police. But I want to talk about hopelessness. Particularly hopelessness in the criminal justice system.  Black communities have been ravaged by a criminal justice system that has had a far-reaching disparate impact on people of color. Just look at the numbers. 1 in 10 black men in their thirties is in prison or jail. That means 10 percent adult black men may face the heavy collateral consequences of those convictions: bans from federal public housing, reduced employment prospects, disenfranchisement, and ineligibility from poverty programs designed to provide a safety net and which, in their absence, only reinforce poverty and deprivation. Prisons themselves are places of despair. They are full of filth, noise and violence, with limited access to health care and almost no educational programs or structural opportunities for self-improvement. Time passes, but the men and women inside are frozen in time. There is little room for personal growth and transformation. Prisons are places where people fester. And where hope goes to die. The criminal justice system is broken, and broken in a way that has harmed communities of color much more than other communities.But, as I said recently, it does not have to be this way. When schools were formally segregated, and blacks were forced to attend dilapidated, under-funded, barely functioning schools, the situation must have felt hopeless to the thousands of black students and their families who were being systemically denied access to quality education. But in the face of that hopelessness, the United States Supreme Court intervened. And, in Brown v. Board of Education, the Court said loudly that segregation was wrong. And that it needed to be stopped. Immediately. That was message of hope. That was a call for change. That was a rallying cry for action and an articulated vision of what is possible.Today there is once again anger and hopelessness. But there are also small glimmers of change on the horizon. Attorney General Eric Holder recently announced his ""Smart on Crime"" initiative, designed to reduce prison populations, address racial disparities, and help men and women reenter society after serving their time behind bars. The federal government and some states are experimenting with reentry courts, designed to help the very people - formerly incarcerated individuals - who were put in prison by those same federal and state government agencies. New Jersey voted to amend its Constitution to reform its bail practices in ways that help the poor.  California reclassified a number of felony offenses to misdemeanors. And states around the country are considering new policies that will help dramatically reduce prison populations. These are good initial, steps for change. But in the wake of Ferguson and Garner, where two unarmed black men died and neither white officer was indicted, we need more. We need desperately to build a broader consensus about race and justice.And that is where I see the greatest spark of hope. Ferguson and Garner, despite their tragic dimensions, are generating a broader national consciousness. Wherever you turn, people are talking about race, often in thoughtful and heartbreaking ways that will reverberate for years to come. People who have not been part of the dialogue are now, sometimes for the first time, talking about these issues. People who have not been paying attention are now sitting up and paying attention, are now expressing concern that something is fundamentally not right.   To heal, we need hope. Hope that is born of an honest dialogue between whites and blacks, between communities and police departments, between policy makers and the constituents they are tasked to serve. Hope that seeks to remedy the harm caused by systems that simply do not work, that cause more poverty, and that create more distrust.   It may be too soon for this message of hope. Emotions may be too raw, pain may be too deep. But I am putting it out there now. Because hope is aspirational. And I do not think that we, as a society, can survive in a place without it."

Many areas are flooded,"" Ben Evardone, congressman for Eastern Samar, said from his base in the provincial capital Borongan.Local radio reported at least two people were killed in Eastern Samar, that could not be confirmed by officials. The Philippine Red Cross said they were also verifying the report.Hagupit had weakened to a category 3 storm, two notches below ""super typhoon,"" when it hit land, but still brought torrential rain and the risk of potentially disastrous storm surges of up to 4.5 meters (15 ft).""This storm is still very strong, it could bring massive devastation,"" said weather forecaster Alvin Pura.The eye of the typhoon was located 70 km (45 miles) northwest of Catbalogan, Samar, after slamming into the town of Dolores, in Eastern Samar, on Saturday night.After churning across Samar island overnight, it was expected to make a second landfall on the island of Masbate around 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Sunday, the Philippine weather bureau PAGASA said.""There were areas that experienced storm surges,"" said Science and Technology Secretary Mario Montejo, adding the agency was verifying the exact height of the waves.Hagupit was moving west northwest at 15 kph (9 mph), bringing winds of up to 160 kph (99 mph) near the center and gusts of up to 195 kph (121 mph).The weather bureau said Hagupit - which means ""lash"" in Filipino - maintained its projected path towards Masbate, Romblon and Oriental Mindoro provinces, slightly north of areas devastated by super typhoon Haiyan last year and missing the capital Manila.Residents of low-lying villages and landslide-prone areas had been evacuated to schools, civic centers, town halls, gyms and churches, the national disaster agency said.There were more than 1.2 million people crowding over 1,500 evacuation centers across central Philippines, said Gwendolyn Pang, secretary general of the Philippine Red Cross, adding local governments were providing the evacuees' basic needs.But there were worries on sanitation and the impact on health of the evacuees in cramped spaces especially in urban areas.""The critical issue is in evacuation centers where there is a high number of evacuees,"" said Social Work Secretary Corazon Soliman. ""We are concerned that the congestion will cause more threat on health.""Environment and humanitarian groups are hoping the typhoon would spur action at U.N. climate talks in Lima, where almost 200 nations are meeting to work out an accord to slow global warming, due at a summit in Paris in a year's time.""My country is under water, farms have been wiped away, homes destroyed, families separated,"" Shubert Ciencia of the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement and a member of global relief organization Oxfam, said in Lima.""Nobody should have to live under the threat of destruction year after year. But we want action, not pity. Negotiators have a chance to make history by standing up for those who have already lost so much and the millions more who will suffer the same fate unless we act now,"" Ciencia said.An Oxfam report in November showed Asia is highly vulnerable to increasingly severe and frequent weather extremes and woefully underprepared to manage growing crises.(Reporting by Rosemarie Francisco and Manny Mogato in Manila and Alister Doyle in Lima)"

The university has suspended activities at all campus fraternal organizations amid an investigation into a published report in which a student described being sexually assaulted by seven men in 2012 at the Phi Kappa Psi house. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae538b240000310054e2e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A now ubiquitous article in Rolling Stone released just two weeks ago has and continues to raise important issues pertaining to how rape cases tend to play out, both at UVA and in our society at large. As people begin to question the integrity of the journalist who broke this story, the veracity of the survivor, and whether this whole issue should ever have been raised in the first place, there are many lessons we can all learn today and as this story continues to unfold. First, many people who have a vested interest in maintaining their reputation will stop at nothing -- including disparaging a gang rape survivor -- to keep it. Second, Post Traumatic Stress leads many to behave in ways that are difficult to understand. Third, our culture needs to shift from doubting the word of a survivor to being seriously critical about the expressed denials of accused felons.In the incident that has so galvanized the attention of the public recently, several of ""Jackie's"" alleged friends are reported to have refused to take her to the hospital for fear of the repercussions to Jackie's reputation, and to their own chances of attending fraternity parties. This callous disregard for the safety of a fellow students have now been amplified by artfully worded denials from UVA's Phi Psi chapter and even by some of those who say they are trying to help end rape at UVA. Despite the obsession that some at UVA have in prioritizing reputation over human welfare as now has been laid bare, we all have even more reason to believe that Jackie was gang raped at Phi Psi, that UVA has a deeper cultural problem with rape than we could ever have imagined, and that the way this story has played out teaches us a great deal about how not to treat a woman who has survived a horrific trauma. Ask yourself. When someone is accused of a felony, what is his most common reaction? ""It wasn't me!"" ""I didn't do it!"" When a group of men are accused of a crime, it is all too common that they close ranks and fight back, whether they are a fraternity, athletic team, or street gang. Such individuals aren't men of character; rather, they are boys who can shave. Men take responsibility. Boys deny responsibility and lie to cover it up. The way that the national fraternity in question is behaving has lessons to teach all of us about why we should be use our critical thinking skills when listening to a group responsible for a venue where a gang rape has been alleged. In an apparent attempt to discredit the word of a woman who has consistently described the central events surrounding her gang rape at the hands of men located in the Phi Psi house, brothers exclaim that no member of their chapter worked at a particular location on campus where Jackie's alleged perpetrator is said to have been employed. While at first this seems damning, recall that in the original Rolling Stone story, a man in the room where the gang rape was reported said ""Don't you want to be a brother?"" This statement itself shows that the attacker wasn't a technical ""Member"" of Phi Psi, but was likely either trying to get a bid (rushing), or trying to move from probationary status to membership (pledging). An 18-year-old young woman invited to a fraternity house is unlikely to know the difference between a rushee, pledge or member. She just knows that a guy invited her there and she was subsequently gang raped. In a press release, Phi Psi claims that they did not have a date function or social event during the weekend of September 28th, 2012. Having been in a fraternity and talking with others whose fraternity experience is more recent, I can tell you that the most out of control nights happen when there wasn't anything official happening. It is also a good possibility that an individual, in the cloud of PTSD, misremembers an exact date. Certainly if a gang rape was planned, the chapter would have every reason not to register an official social gathering with their University. We should also be highly critical of statements by national fraternities implying that they wouldn't violate university policy on when they take in new members, particularly when such an organization has had a confirmed gang rape in that very location where a brother was tried and convicted of rape and spent jail time. While some seem seriously concerned about alleged discrepancies in ""Jackie's"" statements, we need to look beneath the surface. Why? Ask yourself this question. If you told the same story about something that happened to you to several different people, or to the same person several times, do you think you would tell it exactly the same way every time? If you are human and not a cyborg, you would emphasize different details each time you told the same basic story. Now try to imagine that you have experienced an unspeakable trauma -- a family member being shot in front of you, watching your child fall from a cliff when you were just inches away from grabbing her before she fell, having seven men take turns shoving their penis and a bottle inside one of your body cavities. Do you think you would have the super-human capacity to be perfectly clear headed immediately afterward or shortly after? Would you be able to talk about the incident in exactly the same way every time? If you experience severe trauma like a human, you would likely go through several stages of recovery. These stages would likely include times when you were highly emotional, other times emotionally withdrawn, times when you were tired of thinking about it and just said 'it didn't happen,' and times when you were strong enough to put words to your experience. That is called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.This is important. How Jackie described minor details of the incident -- the number of perpetrators, the exact status of the lead perpetrator with the fraternity -- is completely consistent with PTSD resulting from a rape. I have interviewed over 100 rape survivors, and written seven books on the subject. I can tell you with confidence that survivors talk about their experience very differently at different points in time. So if someone at first recalls five perpetrators and later recalls seven, it was likely just too painful for her to remember the other two when she began recounting the incident.We should also learn from this incident that after a rape is reported, those closest to the survivor often turn on her. Published reports assert that Jackie's ""close friends"" have come to doubt her account. Does this mean the event in question didn't happen? No. Again, that her friends acknowledge that details have changed over time is exactly consistent with PTSD. Perhaps her friends have grown tired of the tidal wave of negative attention that UVA has received, and wish for the reputation of their alma mater to be restored. Or perhaps they simply have not been educated well by an administration that seems to just want to push rape under the rug, as some at UVA have even admitted was their approach in the past. An alleged ""close friend"" of Jackie now reportedly says she was misled about what happened by her friend. Just as Thanksgiving break has come to a close, and this friend has no doubt has been peppered by questions from relatives about whether UVA is really such a horrible place, her loyalty to her school's reputation seems to outweigh her ability to empathize with, believe, and support a friend. We should all be highly critical of this change in disposition from initial support to turning on the one who undermines UVAs reputation.Still others express shock that Jackie didn't immediately rush to the hospital or to the police. Recall that Jackie's ""friends"" were more concerned that Jackie's reputation would be 'shot' and perhaps their own chances of getting into a fraternity party or becoming a member would be ended if they took her to the hospital. Can anyone be realistically surprised that after experiencing gang rape, an 18 year old young woman would be swayed by friends who callously abandoned her best interests at a time when they should have supported her? Rape survivors frequently question their own judgment after a rape; they look to friends for direction, and in this case those friends told her to just brush it off. No wonder she tried to do so.So there are indeed many lessons we can continue to learn from the report of a gang rape at UVA. Women who experience rape often describe it differently at different times. This doesn't make them a liar, it makes them human. People accused of felonies have every motivation to lie or to selectively tell the truth. Some fraternities and universities would rather focus on protecting their reputation than on helping human beings in their greatest time of need. And finally, we all need to take a critical eye to the denials of accused felons, work to support people who have experienced extreme trauma, and stand together against sexual violence. Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-656-HOPE for the National Sexual Assault Hotline."

It is, of course, commonplace in American politics for presidents to be lambasted for their policies, their programs, their values, and even their personal quirks. Sometimes the tone crosses the line. John Adams was accused by a political opponent of ""swallowing up"" every ""consideration of the public welfare ... in a continual grasp for power."" James Madison was demeaned as ""Little Jemmy,"" because he was short. James Buchanan, who once declared that workers should get by on a dime a day, came to be mocked as ""Ten Cents Jimmy."" John Tyler, who assumed the presidency after the death of William Henry Harrison, was ridiculed as ""His Accidency."" Congressman Abraham Lincoln castigated President James K. Polk as a ""completely bewildered man."" Opponents of Woodrow Wilson's reinstitution of the draft in World War I accused him of ""committing a sin against humanity."" Critics of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal attacked him as an ""un-American radical."" Richard Nixon was famously known as ""Tricky Dick,"" and of course he was not ""A Crook."" At the height of the Vietnam War, Lyndon Johnson was excoriated by his opponents as a ""Murderer"" and a ""War Criminal."" But no president in our nation's history has ever been castigated, condemned, mocked, insulted, derided, and degraded on a scale even close to the constantly ugly attacks on President Obama. From the day he assumed office -- indeed, even before he assumed office -- he was subjected to unprecedented insults in often the most hateful terms.He has been accused of being born in Kenya, of being a ""secret Muslim,"" of being complicit with the Muslim Brotherhood, of wearing a ring bearing a secret verse from the Koran, of having once been a Black Panther, of refusing to recite the pledge of allegiance, of seeking to confiscate all guns, of lying about just about everything he has ever said, ranging from Benghazi to the Affordable Care Act to immigration, of faking bin Laden's death, and of funding his campaigns with drug money. It goes on and on and on. Even the President's family is treated by his political enemies with disrespect and disdain.If one browses even respectable websites, one can readily find bumper stickers, coffee cups, and tee-shirts for sale with such messages as: ""Dump This Turd"" (with an image of President Obama); ""Coward! You Left Them To Die in Benghazi"" (with an image of President Obama); ""Somewhere in Kenya A Village Is Missing Its Idiot"" (with an image of President Obama); ""Islam's Trojan Horse"" (with an image of President Obama); ""Pure Evil"" (with an image of President Obama); ""I'm Not A Racist: I Hate His White Half Too"" (with an image of President Obama); ""He Lies!"" (with an image of President Obama); and on and on and on.Now, don't get me wrong. Every one of these messages is protected by the First Amendment, and people have a right to express their views, even in harsh, offensive, cruel, and moronic ways. We the People do not need to trust or admire our leaders, and we should not treat them with respect if we don't feel they deserve our respect. But the sheer vituperation directed at this President goes beyond any rational opposition and is, quite frankly, mind-boggling.In part, of course, this might just be a product of our times. Perhaps the quality of our public discourse has sunk so low that any public official must now expect such treatment. Perhaps any president elected in 2008 would have been greeted with similar scorn and disdain. But, to be honest, that seems unlikely. Of course, there are those who say that this phenomenon is due in part, perhaps in large part, to the fact that President Obama is African-American. But surely racism is dead in America today, right? One fact that might lend some credence to the theory that racism has something to do with the tenor of the attacks on President Obama is that only one other president in our history has been the target of similar (though more subdued) personal attacks. In his day, this president was castigated by the press and his political opponents as a ""liar,"" a ""despot,"" a ""usurper,"" a ""thief,"" a ""monster,"" a ""perjurer,"" an ""ignoramus,"" a ""swindler,"" a ""tyrant,"" a ""fiend,"" a ""coward,"" a ""buffoon,"" a ""butcher,"" a ""pirate,"" a ""devil,"" and a ""king."" He was charged with being ""cunning,"" ""thickheaded,"" ""heartless,"" ""filthy,"" and ""fanatical."" He was accused of behaving ""like a thief in the night,"" of being ""the miserable tool of traitors and rebels,"" and of being ""adrift on a current of racial fanaticism."" He was labeled by his enemies ""Abraham Africanus the First.""But, of course, race had nothing to do with it then, either."

The phrase has become a rallying cry for those protesting abusive police tactics and how law enforcement treats black people.A grand jury in Staten Island voted Wednesday not to indict New York City police officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Garner. The decision came the week after a grand jury decided to not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for the killing of black 18-year-old Michael Brown.This isn't the first instance of professional athletes using this form of protest. Last month, five St. Louis Rams players entered the field with their hands raised as a form of surrender. Some witnesses said Michael Brown had his hands up when shot, and the gesture, along with the phrase ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" has been embraced by demonstrators nationwide."

Unfortunately, all three are owned by separate studios, and so the comic fan dream has long remained exactly that. However, a recent comment by Marvel comics creator Stan Lee is reason to believe that some efforts are being made to bring this cinematic crossover into reality.At a book signing and Q&A event celebrating Marvel's 75th anniversary on Saturday, Lee, who was joined by director Kevin Smith, was asked by a fan dressed as Captain America whether the three would make it into a film together. Lee provided the following response:It’s something that Marvel is very concerned about. It’s very difficult to bring ‘em all together because these characters are so successful and make so much money that the studios that have the rights don’t want to let them go. So that’s something that all the lawyers and all the production companies have to work out. Whether they get it worked out, I don’t know.Certainly a fan of the possibility of such an epic combination, Lee is also aware of the big money that would follow its release. “It is a shame that [Disney] Marvel can’t distribute every one of them,"" Lee said at the event. ""Because then we could put them all together … in a movie that would make a hundred trillion dollars!” Watch the full event below.H/T ScreenCrush"
