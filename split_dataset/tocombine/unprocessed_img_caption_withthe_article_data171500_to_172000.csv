Some of the nation’s largest retailers that literally cannot wait until the day after Thanksgiving to kick off the holiday shopping season will begin Black Friday sales on Thursday, an unprecedented move that is being met with resistance from employees who now have to work on the holiday.Grey Thursday sales may be an indication that retailers are anxious about shopper turnout this year after last year’s record Black Friday turnout. The National Retail Federation projects that holiday spending will only increase 4.1 percent this year, less than last year’s 5.6 percent rise.

My son waits eagerly at the top of the stairs and when I finally emerge from the gloom, we curl up under a blanket on the couch and read each one in turn. We read The Grinch, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, Rudolph, and Charlie Brown until my throat is scratchy. Because these books only come out for a month, they still feel fresh and new, even though we know most of them by heart.

(Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c88842100003000c52984.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Commitments are scary. They bog you down. They create situations in your life that force you to make decisions. They force you to prioritize. They force you to separate what is most important to you from what really doesn't matter and to make compromises to yourself.Commitments are also beautiful. When you commit to someone you love, to something you care about, to an idea you want to make into a reality, to a belief system that defines you, commitments are no longer seen as scary but as a part of life you would not want to live without. I am sometimes really hard on myself. I have these ideas of the future to create huge world-changing plans and share those with so many people that I end up committing to so many different ways of getting to the same place. I hear so many different ideas, so many different perspectives, and I love them all. I am so open to wanting to help so many people I end up committing myself to different projects because I never commit and then do not follow through. I have been taught to never over-promise and under-deliver, so when I tell someone I am going to help them, I end up helping them, which usually leaves very little time to help myself.I have started to really analyze my idea of commitment. After moving three times growing up, living in three apartments in the city, bouncing back and forth between California, NYC, Vegas and sometimes the random trip to India, I feel very noncommittal in terms of my surroundings. Maybe it is a defense mechanism. I put up walls, boundaries, and situations keeping me arm's length from just about everyone I meet. I am everyone's friend, confidante; I love everyone, and yet it is hard for me to understand the idea of a commitment. It made me start to think about all of the people in my life who have stepped in and stepped out of the sidekick role, the romantic interest, the best friend, the confidante, and how as I grow, most of these relationships have changed.That being said, I am also a survivor, a hard worker, and an educator. I did everything I could to graduate with a 4.0 from college. I threw myself into my career and helped expand a company that dramatically prospered due to my efforts, but so what? I still do not feel my potential has been reached, that I have given it my all, that I have thrown myself into something so fully or have loved so devotedly to make myself feel complete. I had a friend recently tell me that I just keep talking about my awareness around this issue. He said, ""You realize something then you talk about it for two months -- just do it."" Another friend said: You want to stop being known for connecting everyone else to help them with what they are doing, and you just want to be known for doing something yourself, so just do it. Some people are known for having the most home runs even if they are on a team that barely ever wins. They may have never had to give it their all, but just keep swinging and it comes easy for them to bang it out of the park time and time again. I keep thinking about this analogy of settling for home runs, for never being focused enough to get up to bat the last inning of the World Series to give it my everything to win. I realize I do not want to be the type of person who rests on my home runs, who half commits to a lot of different projects knowing my 20 percent will feel like 100 percent to everyone else. But deep inside I know I am not giving anyone or anything my all. There is something about feeling so passionate about something or about someone that you wake up every day with the intention to just commit yourself, where you will do whatever it takes to refine your skills, your mastery and give your gift to the world. Commitment is about growing up. If you can't commit to anything outside yourself, then you don't really know who you are -- you can never grow, you cannot prosper. I don't want to have trophies on my shelf showing how may home runs I hit. It's not about the ego validation or the fact that I ""won the game"" for the team. It's about believing in myself, believing in committing to doing whatever I want to do and then actually taking the action to do it.I think it's really scary when a dream of yours comes true and you realize you have to find a new dream, when you have grown out of your old dreams, and when the home runs start to feel like missed hits. At the end of the day, I am realizing what matters is giving it every piece of your being, not really ever knowing if you are going to win or lose but at least giving it your all, because losing when you gave it your all is a lot better than winning when you didn't have to try at all.For more by Amanda Slavin, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."
3,TRAVEL,How To Earn Elite Status In One Flight,"Scott Keyes, Contributor
Travel expert and author of 'How To Fly For Free: Practical Ti...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-earning-elite-stat_us_5b9c8814e4b03a1dcc7f84ad,"Both American and US Air offer status challenges for their higher elite levels, though they're more expensive and likely require multiple flights.",2012-11-19,"FILE - In this film publicity image released by Paramount, George Clooney portrays Ryan Bingham in a scene from ""Up in the Air."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures, Dale Robinette, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c88142500003300361a46.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It will come as no surprise to anyone who's flown in the past 10 years that the process is about as enjoyable as a colonic. Bag fees, cramped seats and waiting around in lines are just a few of the perks.A lucky few, meanwhile, get to bypass these hassles by flying tens of thousands of miles and becoming ""elite"" flyers.Most people think elite perks are reserved for the people who either (a) travel for business, or (b) take a lot of vacations.That was once true, but now there's an easy shortcut to elite status in just one international flight planned (or even a cross-country flight). It's called a ""status challenge"".Here's how it works:American Airlines, for instance, usually requires you to fly 25,000 miles in a calendar year to become a ""Gold"" member, their lowest level of elite status. It comes with a lot of perks. As a Gold member, you get two free checked bags, priority check-in at security, early boarding, seat upgrades, 25 percent bonus miles, and standby fees waived.Fortunately, they also offer a secret shortcut to Gold status.If you call up and register for a Gold challenge, all it takes to earn elite status is for you to fly 5,000 points* in three months, which you can almost always accomplish in one international flight. For instance, if you already have a flight booked next month from New York to Paris (a roundtrip distance of 7,240 miles), you can call up American at 1-800-882-8880, get registered, and be an elite flyer as soon as you set foot back in the states. Unfortunately, it costs $140 to register, but for many people this is a small price to pay to get the countless perks of elite status and make flying a lot easier for the next 14+ months.Similarly, US Airways allows flyers to register for a status challenge. If you fly 7,500 miles (or 10 legs) in three months, you'll earn Silver status, which includes one free checked bag, priority check-in at security, early boarding, seat upgrades, 25 percent bonus miles, and standby fees waived. It costs $200 to register.Both American and US Air also offer status challenges for their higher elite levels, though they're more expensive and likely require multiple flights.For American, platinum (middle tier) status, which includes two free checked bags, priority check-in at security, early boarding, seat upgrades, 100 percent bonus miles, and standby fees waived, can be earned by flying 10,000 points in three months. It costs $240 to register.For US Airways, you have to pay $400 and fly 15,000 miles (or 20 legs) in three months to earn Gold (middle tier) status. which includes three free checked bags, priority check-in at security, early boarding, seat upgrades, 50 percent bonus miles, and standby fees waived. Platinum (upper-middle tier) status will set you back $600 for the same benefits and a bump up to 75 percent bonus miles. You must fly 22,500 miles or 30 segments in three months to qualify.If you're like most people, ""a hassle"" is the most likely descriptors for flying. But it doesn't have to be that way. If you've got an international trip planned soon, you can use it to easily become an elite flyer and join the crowd who, when asked how their flight was, can honestly answer, ""it was great!""* - One important thing to note: 5,000 American points is slightly different than 5,000 American miles. (I know it's complicated, I'm sorry. Blame AA.) The number of points you earned is a product of the miles you fly multiplied by the fare class you purchased. For example, flying in ""W"" class, a section in ""Discount Economy Class"", earns you 1.00 point per mile flown, but flying in ""S"" class, a section in ""Deep Discount Economy Class"", earns you 0.50 points per mile flown. I have no idea where they come up with these letters, and yes, it's all quite silly. But that's the game they play, so just pay attention to your fare class and you can easily take advantage.Excerpted from Keyes's new e-book How To Fly For Free: Practical Tips The Airlines Don't Want You To Know."

Next comes Black Friday, where we trade in food consumption for material goods and appropriate stocking ""stuffers."" Then comes a three- to four-week sprint through December, with more ""stuff"" to do than usual -- holiday parties to plan, prepare and or attend, travel or hosting arrangements to set up -- and more ""stuff"" to get -- cards, presents, trees, wrapping paper, you name it.And this year, in tough economic times, we have the added worry that perhaps we can't afford as much ""stuff"" to pass around, which might lead to a more empty celebration, so what ""stuff"" can we do to make up for it?Our culture is very focused on acquisition of both things and experiences. There is an underlying assumption at work that freedom lies out there somewhere, if only we can own more of our environment so we can control it more and thus be happy and free.But there is also an underlying reality at work, which is that the more ""stuffed"" we become, the more weighed down we are, both physically and emotionally. Now we need bigger places to put all our ""stuff,"" more insurance to protect it, and more time to do more ""stuff"" in order to maintain it all.Peace practitioners throughout the centuries have experienced a different kind of freedom, one gained by moving against the prevailing momentum of our culture. For example, yogis seek freedom by turning in, by really feeling, experiencing what is going on inside their bodies as they are toned and stretched, twisted and squeezed. In time, through this process, there is a great letting go of all the accumulated stuff -- physical, mental, and emotional tension -- that has come between us and our true natures.As you begin to get glimpses of this original state of inner peace and spaciousness, all that other ""stuff"" that dominated our lives comes into perspective, and we begin to experience true freedom.So if there is less stuff to be accumulated this season, that is not a bad thing. Ultimately, it matters less how much stuff you have, or have to do, and more about how little space it all occupies in your mind.May you have a healthy, safe, and peaceful holiday.peace, --dbFor more by Doug Binzak, click here.For more on wisdom, click here."
5,WELLNESS,Everyday Heroes,"Kaylee Scottaline, Contributor

More than 70,000 customers of Long Island Power Authority in New York were without electricity Monday, two weeks after Superstorm Sandy struck. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c87ee2000003000fd9b5e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, here on Long Island, we all recognize the heroes who came to our aid. The firemen who worked for days on end, carrying homebound people down numerous flights of stairs; the police officers who kept us safe at darkened intersections, patrolled our gas lines while people were losing their sanity and protected the worst areas from looting. There were the linemen, working night and day to get almost every single home on Long Island out of the dark. Whether we agree with LIPA's response or not, we can't ignore the countless numbers of men and women who worked, day and night, in bad weather, to get us back in power. All while many of these firemen, officers and linemen went home to their own dark and cold homes, wondering when their own power could get turned back on. But what about the everyday people?We lost power in my home for two days. At five months pregnant, this was the end of the world for me. It was cold, I couldn't take a warm shower and what would I eat?? We filled a cooler with milk, yogurts, and enough chicken for dinner, and we figured out how to cook an entire meal on the BBQ. All in all, it wasn't so bad, actually. We played board games and lit candles (my boyfriend will never again pick on me for my scented candle addiction), and it only lasted two days. Now, I look at my coworkers, friends and the strangers on the news who are still suffering and I think -- what was I crying about??I cannot begin to imagine losing my home or my car or having sewage in the streets, much less in my house. I look at those who are still, weeks later, pumping water out of their homes and I think, these people are heroes, too. These brave men and women, with babies and young children or elderly to care for, who are forced into overcrowded shelters, their clothing, diapers, medication all destroyed, and counting on the kindness and genourosity of others to help them get back onto their feet. How do you explain to your 7-year-old that everything they own is gone forever? And to the children who go to school every day now, knowing it's the only warm place they'll get to be all day. Of course, we are all happy to be alive, to have our loved ones to still come home to at the end of the day. But it would be nice to have that home to go to. When I look back at the events of this forceful, tragic storm and I think of bravery and fearlessness, these are the people that I think of and admire. We all have fears, it's human nature. But at the end of the day, how we respond to adversity is when we see the true measure of ourselves and our neighbors. It's when we learn just how strong and courageous we really are and how much we can make it through when the you-know-what hits the fan. Or our streets and our homes. In one of my favorite scenes from the movie Clueless, Alicia Silverstone's character, Cher, is donating her skis to the Pismo Beach Disaster Relief Fund. When her father tells her that he doesn't think they need her skis, Cher's somewhat misguided but heartfelt response was, ""Daddy, some people lost all their belongings. Don't you think that includes athletic equipment?"" Let's not forget that, while the storm may be in the past, it is still very present for many and donations are still needed. Maybe not your skis, but a few bars of soap, cleaning products, winter coats, blankets, diapers, cereal, etc. It all goes a long way, and can remind us what's really important in life and the things we all tke for granted every day. After all, isn't pulling together when times are tough what fearlessness is all about?For more by Kaylee Scottaline, click here.For more on wisdom, click here."
