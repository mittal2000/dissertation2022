Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyse-shutdown_us_559ea945e4b01c2162a60c3b,And you thought the latest iPhone update was a hassle.,2015-07-09,"<p>Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) a day after the market closed for over three hours yesterday due to a 'technical glitch' on July 9, 2015, in New York City. The market had a normal opening today with no reports of problems.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559eba9414000087049a755d.jpeg?ops=crop_400_394_2240_1120%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale," NEW YORK -- The Wednesday afternoon outage at the New York Stock Exchange was caused by a software update.The upgrade, which was released before the market opened, was meant to improve the timestamps on stock quote and trade data. Per standard protocol, the firm uploaded the software to just one computer first, according to a statement released Thursday.But as traders began logging on after 7 a.m., messages malfunctioned between the unit with new software and their computers, called gateways. That's when NYSE technicians discovered the mistake. The gateways had not been loaded with new software that would make them compatible with the upgraded trading unit.Before the market opened at 9:30 a.m., the gateways were updated with the correct version of the software. Once trading began, however, some customers reported issues with the system.  By 11:32 a.m., the NYSE had suspended trading on two exchanges for trading securities. ""At 11:32am, because NYSE and NYSE MKT were actively trading but customers were still reporting unusual system behavior, the decision was made to suspend trading on NYSE and NYSE MKT,"" the NYSE said in a statement. ""NYSE ARCA, Arca Options and NYSE AMEX Options were not impacted by this event and continued to trade normally.""Trading eventually resumed at 3:10 p.m. -- roughly 3.5 hours after the halt.Still, the hiccup stirred fears of a cyberattack, particularly because it happened amid a flurry of other technical malfunctions in the business world. Earlier that day, United Airlines temporarily grounded all planes worldwide over a “network connectivity issue”; about 4,900 flights were affected. Around noon, the homepage for The Wall Street Journal -- a financial industry bible -- crashed, showing WSJ.com visitors a 504 error message. (A Department of Homeland Security official told The Huffington Post on Wednesday there was ""no indication"" that the glitch was related to a cyberattack.)These incidents rattled investors who were already shaky over Greece’s debt crisis and the plummeting Shanghai stock market.The NYSE Composite Index, which measure the performance of all stocks listed on the exchange, was up nearly 1 percent by Thursday afternoon.

The Church of Cannabis had its first service July 1 but said its members would not use cannabis after law enforcement warned that police would arrest anyone who smoked pot.Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Attorney General Greg Zoeller, Superintendent Douglas G. Carter of Indiana State Police, Indianapolis Police Chief Rick Hite, Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard and Marion County Sheriff John Layton also are defendants in the lawsuit.By filing its highly anticipated religious liberty claim Wednesday, the First Church of Cannabis has put the question everyone’s been wondering about in the hands of the court:Is this a real religion?And does it have a protected right to practice legitimate beliefs?Some legal experts remain skeptical that the cannabis church’s challenge of Indiana’s marijuana laws will survive for long in front of a judge. But the case focuses on — if a bit unusually — some of the weighty complexities of religious liberty claims and raises lingering questions over how Indiana’s new Religious Freedom Restoration Act can and can’t be used.“Is this a genuine religion, or is it a pretext?” said Indiana University law professor David Orentlicher. “Because you can imagine, with anyone who’s using a controlled substance, we can’t let them all say, ‘It’s my religion.’ The court has to draw a line somewhere.”That’s the first test in court that the Church of Cannabis faces: whether weed is part of a sincere, deep religious belief.The Church of Cannabis contends that for its members, called “Cannaterians,” cannabis is a religious sacrament that “brings us closer to ourselves and others. It is our fountain of health, our love, curing us from illness and depression,” according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday in Marion Circuit Court.But state laws making marijuana illegal burden that practice of religion, the church says, putting its members in danger of prosecution for using their sacrament.Also on HuffPost:"

3,POLITICS,Majority Of Denver Voters Support Marijuana In Bars,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/majority-of-denver-voters-support-limited-marijuana-use-in-bars-survey-finds_us_559dd1dde4b05b1d028fb2da,"A majority of Denver voters support recreational marijuana smoking in bars and other public venues in the city, according",2015-07-09,Because Most Americans Are Unenthusiastic About It,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559de2b71700002600325e03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"A majority of Denver voters support recreational marijuana smoking in bars and other public venues in the city, according to a new survey, boosting a new drive to expand legalized pot. A survey released Thursday by Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling found that 56 percent of likely 2015 voters in Denver would support allowing businesses to permit pot consumption on the premises. Only 40 percent said they were opposed. The survey appears to support a recently launched petition drive in Denver for a ballot measure that would give businesses the ability to allow for marijuana consumption. The measure would prohibit pot sales at the establishments, so patrons would have to bring their own. “Denver voters have repeatedly voted in favor of treating marijuana similarly to alcohol,” said Mason Tvert, communications director for Marijuana Policy Project and a key backer of Colorado's 2012 recreational marijuana law. “For the same reasons many adults enjoy having a drink in a social setting, many adults would enjoy using cannabis.""The petition proposes to allow marijuana smoking and vaporizing in spaces that can't be publicly viewed. Smoking would likely be confined to enclosed outdoor areas, so venues can comply with state law that limits indoor smoking. Marijuana tourism would get a boost from the measure, allowing visitors to Denver, which has become the ""epicenter"" of the legal marijuana industry, a place to consume their legal weed. Currently, tourists looking to light up have limited options, but are able to consume their weed in some hotels.Colorado became the first state -- and the first government in the world -- to legalize and regulate recreational marijuana for adults in 2012, with the first retail shops opening in 2014. But state law continues to ban recreational marijuana consumption ""openly and publicly."" The law doesn't specifically block pot use in private clubs for those 21 and older, and the proposal would help to define private clubs in Denver. Since Colorado's recreational marijuana law passed, a number of underground, fee-based, bring-your-own-pot clubs have sprung up in and around Denver. Law enforcement has at times cracked down on those gatherings. A handful of recreational marijuana clubs exist outside of Denver. Activists must collect about 5,000 signatures of registered Denver voters by August in order for the ""limited social use"" initiative to appear on the November ballot. Tvert announced the campaign last week, along with Brian Vicente, attorney and co-author of Colorado's recreational marijuana law, and Jane West, a cannabis-related events promoter. ""It would be ridiculous to limit alcohol consumption only to people’s homes,"" said Tvert. ""So why must marijuana use be limited in such a fashion? There’s no rational reason to treat marijuana consumers so differently.""Some state lawmakers agree that the issue needs to be resolved, but they weren't sure the initiative is the best approach. Democratic state Rep. Dan Pabon, who represents Denver, told HuffPost that it's not clear that this proposal would work without violating state laws. But it at least ""invites a much-needed conversation"" about where citizens would, and wouldn't, embrace public marijuana use, he said.""First, people are already doing this anyway,"" said state Sen. Pat Steadman (D). ""It's happening whether we like it or not. It would be best to regulate matters rather than allow the 'wild wild West' situation we have now. I think we should let the free market find solutions, but we have to remove legal barriers before this can happen.""Steadman said he hadn't yet decided if the initiative strikes the right policy balance.State Rep. Jonathan Singer (D), a vocal supporter of marijuana policy reform in the state, said that adults should absolutely be able to consume cannabis legally and safely in private venues. ""It's ludicrous that we can't have something similar to the bars, restaurants and private clubs we have for alcohol,"" Singer said.Singer told HuffPost that he plans to introduce legislation in the upcoming legislative session to address the issue.PPP surveyed 629 likely Denver voters who intend to vote in the November election, from June 12 to June 15.Also on HuffPost:"
4,TECH,Facebook's Small New Update Is Actually Pretty Huge,Alexis Sobel Fitts,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-update-news-feed_us_559ea560e4b05b1d028fdde9,"On Thursday, Facebook announced a change to its News Feed: Instead of passively following the glut of content selected by",2015-07-09,"<p><a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/facebook"">Facebook</a> is changing your News Feed in a good way.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559ecfda140000e3049a75d8.jpeg?ops=crop_0_9_5036_2156%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale," On Thursday, Facebook announced a change to its News Feed: Instead of passively following the glut of content selected by the site's algorithm, now users can pick a few dozen friends and pages to prioritize what appears at the top of their News Feed.It seems like a simple update, until you consider how much power Facebook's News Feed algorithm has over what we read.In 2014, Facebook was responsible for about a quarter of all traffic --  across the entire web . That means that almost one-fourth of the time that people came to a website, they came from Facebook.com. Aside from status updates and baby photos, Facebook has become an important source for information and news. Nearly half of Americans with Internet access use Facebook to read news about politics and government, according to a 2014 Pew poll, about as many as followed local television. And the News Feed is the central hub of the Facebook referral service, a hub that is increasingly becoming the way Americans get information.But Facebook’s News Feed has always been a passive experience, with the site’s algorithm determining what its users see. The idea that Facebook should be the arbiter of what's important to its users started with the News Feed's origin story when, according to David Kirkpatrick’s book The Facebook Effect, CEO Mark Zuckerberg justified using an algorithm in the service of users: “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.”  The problem, for those who might find their interests more piqued by Africa than pest control, is there’s no clear way to override the algorithm -- other than clicking on the kind of content you want to see and hoping for the best. It’s a nannying stance that the company continues to espouse, most recently in an interview this week for Time with Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s News Feed product management director. A purely chronological feed, he said, would be bad for users because “people would miss a lot more important content. Our whole mission is to show people content that we think that they find meaningful.""Determining what Facebook thinks interests its users has become make or break for publishers. Some companies like Upworthy and Mashable draw in readers by gaming the Facebook algorithm. Others, like The New York Times and BuzzFeed, have begun hosting their content directly on Facebook.And regardless of how well sites are able to game the algorithm, everyone is vulnerable to shifts in Facebook’s policies. When the company announced in April that it would prioritize content from users’ “friends” over that from “pages,” it sent digital publishers into a panic. In February, Facebook’s top 10 publishers saw a huge drop in traffic referrals, which was later attributed to a News Feed bug. But the message it sent was clear: Just as easily as Facebook can send traffic to a site, it can also take that traffic away.These effects were highlighted in a study published by two Facebook employees in the research journal Science this May. The researchers found that the algorithm limits “cross-cutting” news -- stories that take the opposite political stance to a user’s self-identification -- eliminating 8 percent of oppositional news stories for liberals and 5 percent for conservatives. (Users' choices were also found to limit this cross-cutting content.)On Thursday afternoon, Zuckerberg announced the News Feed update on his personal page. “Our goal is to help you connect with the people and things you care about the most,” he wrote. Though the shift doesn’t fix the problems with the Facebook algorithm, for the first time it makes a portion of the feed transparent -- giving users a margin of accountability over what they read. Prioritize pages about squirrels. Favorite a bunch of news sites about Africa. For now, at least, it’s marginally up to you."

If you’re looking for ‘Trouble,’ you’ve come to the right place."" The 71-year-old rocker hinted at the project earlier this year when he told Rolling Stone magazine there was a possibility he might go on tour for the album. Richards was on tour with the Stones at the time, and when asked if he planned on performing solo, he responded, ""Usually if I put a record out, I do some road work.

That could be a good sign for your relationships. In what can only be described as a poetic finding, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and University of Waterloo found a connection between physical wobbliness and perceived relationship instability. Their study tested the relationship between physical sensation and emotional feeling -- part of a field of inquiry called embodied cognition. They wanted to see if a physical sensation of instability would lead to an emotional perception of the same.First, the researchers asked college students in romantic relationships to sit at either a stable work station or a subtly wobbly one. They also asked each student to rate the stability of his or her relationship. The students sitting at unstable workstations viewed their romantic relationships as being of lower quality, while the stable workstation cohort felt significantly better about their partners.To test this idea in greater depth, researchers reached out to a larger group and asked people who were in longterm, committed relationships to stand on one leg in front of a computer screen. People who wobbled on one leg were more likely to perceive their relationships as unlikely to last than those who stayed steady.Intrigued? Relationship stability isn't the only thing related to balance. If standing on one leg is easy for you, you may be at lower risk for stroke and brain disease, according to a 2014 study. And a 2010 study found a link between this type of balance and living longer. Who's ready to get their tree pose on? H/T The New York Times Also on HuffPost:"

Outside of known meteor showers, these celestial wonders don't exactly appear when you expect them to. But a Japanese company is hoping to change that, taking luck out of the equation and making meteors appear right on time, exactly where expected. The company, called ALE, is raising funds to launch a small satellite filled with pellets that would orbit at about 250 to 300 miles above Earth. The satellite would release pellets on cue, which -- like natural meteoroids -- would burn up as they fall. Companies or individuals would be able to order a meteor or even a whole meteor shower, and have it appear on schedule. ""I'm thinking of streams of meteors that are rare in nature,"" Lena Okajima, the company's founder and CEO, told AFP. ""It is artificial but I want to make really beautiful ones that can impress viewers.""Although she wouldn't reveal what the pellets are made of, Okajima said the company may be able to offer them in different colors.Okajima, who holds a doctorate degree in astronomy from the University of Tokyo, told AFP that the cost to develop and send the CubeSat into orbit would be about $8.2 million, and that the cost of a single artificial meteor would be about $8,200, based on the current exchange rate.The artificial meteors could be used for science as well as a good show, she said. Since scientists would know exactly when and where the fake meteors would fall, they could use telescopes and other equipment to monitor each one.

Paul LePage (R) may have botched his state's veto process, allowing 19 bills he was trying to kill to become law, according to reports.Bills not acted upon by the governor within 10 days are effectively vetoed if the legislature has adjourned, a process known as the ""pocket veto."" When the legislature is in session, bills not acted upon by the governor become law, and that's what opponents of the Republican governor say has happened.That means several bills that LePage opposed will become law, including one that would allow asylum seekers to receive state aid. The Portland Press Herald reports that the 19 bills are being written into law by the nonpartisan office responsible for statutes. However, the governor's office insists the bills shouldn't become law because the legislature had indeed adjourned. The issue appears to be the meaning and context of the word ""adjourned.""The legislature routinely uses the word ""adjourn"" for a temporary recess and it does not always mean the final adjournment of a session, The Portland Press Herald reports. The state's House of Representatives even uses the term ""adjourn"" at the end of each work day. The governor's office insists that the state legislature's use of the word ""adjourn"" to end its session on June 30 means the adjournment rules are in effect and the bills should be vetoed.“I can’t even process this right now, that this is his latest move,” House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe (D) told the Bangor Daily News. “It’s very clear, as far as the role the governor has, when it comes to bills -- whether he signs them, not signs them or vetoes them. To hold them for an arbitrary period of time doesn’t really work. He can’t rewrite the rules.""Along with the asylum bill, the new laws include an act that would prevent the shackling of pregnant prisoners, an act to ban e-cigarettes in many places that already have smoking bans and changes to the state's ""spruce budworm management laws.""The issue may have to be decided in court.“We’ll go to the courts and we’ll ask them,” LePage told the Press Herald. “It’s in the Constitution . . . It’s very clear – very, very clear. Even I can understand it and I’m French.”But opponents say what's clear this time is that LePage messed up.“There’s a huge hole in Gov. Paul LePage’s pocket, and a bunch of bills just fell through, handing his opponents and the Legislature huge victories,” Democratic consultant David Farmer told the Bangor Daily News. "

It was largely influenced by delegates from Africa and South America who often have more conservative views on women’s ordination than Adventists in other regions.Tense discussions throughout the afternoon featured dozens of delegates voicing opinions for and against the question: “Is it acceptable for division executive committees, as they may deem it appropriate in their territories, to make provision for the ordination of women to the gospel ministry?”The vote and discussion, which reflected decades-long division, came a week before the centennial of the death of Ellen White, one of the founders of the denomination, which has 18 million members worldwide.While many mainline denominations have ordained women for more than 50 years, the Seventh-day Adventists form part of a block of Christian groups that do not. Those include Roman Catholics, Southern Baptists, the Orthodox Church in America and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Despite the ban, several U.S. conferences of Seventh-day Adventists have ordained women in recent years, with at least 19 in the mid-Atlantic region and more than 25 in the Pacific Union Conference by the end of 2013.The Adventists’ Southeastern California Conference elected a female president in 2013, and several of the church’s 13 worldwide divisions have approved theological reviews suggesting that women’s ordination should be widely accepted.Women pastors have often held a “commissioned” credential without being formally ordained in the church, which observes its Sabbath on Saturday.President Ted N.C. Wilson, leader of the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church, who sided with a “no” vote and was re-elected to a second five-year term earlier in the meeting, asked for calm before and after the vote.“We have today a spiritual opportunity to refocus our attention on mission and turn our eyes away from this subject,” he said moments after the vote was announced. “I appeal to all of us in this church to put away differences of opinion. You may guard an opinion but let’s be careful how we express it and move ahead.”During the debate on Wednesday, former worldwide president Jan Paulsen spoke at a microphone between statements from delegates and stated his support for a “yes” vote.“Voting ‘no’ will do damage to our church,” warned Paulsen, who was president from 1999 to 2010. “I am fearful of what will happen if we do not allow the church to go forward on this.”In a “State of the Church” video released shortly after Sandra Roberts was elected president of the California conference, Wilson cautioned against “worldly influences” and “the danger of disunity.”During the Wednesday afternoon session, dozens of people took turns at microphones to state their views in two-minute speeches before lining up to write their votes on a secret ballot that was placed in one of five clear boxes at the front of the assembly hall in San Antonio’s Alamodome and Convention Center.“I am a young woman, a young adult, an ethnic minority and a leader of one of the largest youth movements in Adventism,” said Natasha Nebblett, president of Generation of Youth for Christ. “God has already called me to work for him and that is all the calling that I need.”She was followed immediately by Cheryl Doss, head of the denomination’s Institute of World Mission that trains long-term missionaries sent to assignments worldwide. Doss argued that it was not necessary for the church’s 13 world divisions to operate in the same way, just as body parts do not have the same functions.“If one part of the body will function better if women are ordained then that is what they should do,” said Doss, a professor of world mission at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Mich.In between statements for or against the proposed action, delegates raised questions about how some divisions were being portrayed as proponents or opponents of women’s ordination and noted that there is a debate within as well as among the various regions of the church. More than a hundred others stood in line to speak but time ran out before they could comment.“Delegates on both sides recognize how divisive and time- and energy-consuming this debate is, but this vote will not settle the question,” said Laura Vance, a sociologist at Warren Wilson College in Asheville, N.C., who has studied women within Adventism and was a visitor at the gathering. “There is so much emotion here today.”Earlier in the day, the church’s Facebook page for the General Conference Session was filled with comments about how the vote should go, with concern that its outcome could cause division in the worldwide church.But Garrett Caldwell, spokesman for the worldwide denomination, said current officers are committed to remaining united.“We’re not concerned about a split,” he said.Before the vote had been tallied, Caldwell said the status of women who have been ordained by local church bodies despite the church’s official position “will remain the same.”On Tuesday, Adventists tweaked their Fundamental Beliefs statements, including taking the word “partners” out of its section on “Marriage and the Family.”The word “partners” is often used by same-sex couples, said Caldwell, and that’s not the meaning Adventists wanted to convey.“We wanted to make sure we used the language that was very precisely discussing what we mean.”He said they also clarified the section on “Creation” to refer to a “recent six-day creation,” after some professors at Adventist colleges were “beginning to teach some things contrary to our stated and understood beliefs.”Also on HuffPost:"

(AP Photo/Mike Roemer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559e785b1700006004325e8e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The allure of fireworks is pretty self-explanatory. Explosions. Cool colors. They go boom, and they go bang. We ooh and we aah, and sometimes we sing a national anthem that's basically an ode to fireworks. But despite all that, we need to say something, and we need everyone to listen, especially all you professional athletes out there: Stop fucking with fireworks.It's a simple lesson that would have served New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul and Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback C.J. Wilson well. Both are coming to terms with horrifying accidents and subsequent amputations performed this week to treat hand injuries caused by firework accidents on the night of 4th of July. On average, 200 Americans go to the emergency room every day between June 17 and July 17 because of firework-related injurites, according to the Consumer Products Safety Commision. Forty-six percent of those injuries are inflicted on hands and fingers, two important parts of the body for professional athletes.Yes, NFL players -- especially ones whose careers depend on catching and throwing footballs -- need hands to play. Even the positions that don't get to touch the football much, like offensive and defensive line, need their hands to grab, yank and tackle. Like, look at this photo. Is this what you want, football players?Thankfully this guy, Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews, didn't sustain that hand injury playing with fireworks. It was just a routine broken bone. But let it serve as a reminder that you, dear professional athlete, could have a CLUB FOR A HAND if you mess around with fireworks.“Yes, [taking the cast off] will leave my fingers free, which means more sacks and more tackles,” Matthews said when the club was finally removed. See?On Wednesday, Wilson's agent confirmed the hand injury to ESPN. While he declined to elaborate on the specifics of the injury, the Tampa Bay Times reported that Wilson, who appeared in two games last season, lost two fingers on one hand in a 4th of July fireworks accident. Down two fingers, Wilson's playing career is in serious jeopardy, according to the NFL Network. Pierre-Paul's future career prospects are rosier -- he's an All-Pro defensive end and he's got one more finger than Wilson. But his right index finger was amputated, as ESPN reported, and although he's expected to play in 2015, the accident has already proven to be costly. The Giants withdrew their $60 million long-term contract offer to Pierre-Paul in the wake of the incident, citing concerns about his health and overall judgement. Pierre-Paul is still due to make $14.5 million this upcoming season, so all things considered, he'll be okay. Plus: Robot fingers are coming. If anything, Pierre-Paul can use his guaranteed millions to technically become a cyborg. Wilson, on the other hand, might be screwed. An undrafted former member of the Bucs' practice squad, he was expected to compete for a backup cornerback position in training camp. His $585,000 base salary for 2015 is non-guaranteed, so he can be cut at any time at no cost to the team. Fireworks are not worth losing a half-million dollar paycheck and an NFL career. Athletes, take care of your damn hands. You need those things. They're what separate modern man from the fish we evolved from. And your hands, in particular, with all of their strength and dexterity, are what separates you from the plebs who don't have a career in professional athletics. Love fireworks too much to eradicate them from your life completely? Here'a novel idea: HAVE SOMEONE ELSE LIGHT THE FIREWORKS. You have entourages willing to do anything to protect your health (and therefore your playing career and paycheck). Millions of people around the world enjoy the simple pleasures of fireworks without being the sucker who actually puts their fingers near a lit fuse. Next 4th of July, when you're facing a literal truckload of fireworks, just remember: Stop the madness. Put the fireworks down. "
15,RELIGION,What 'Scandalous' Changes Could Be Coming To The Catholic Church?,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-scandalous-changes_us_559ebad6e4b01c2162a61864,It may or may not have something to do with LGBT Catholics.,2015-07-09,"<p>Pope Francis officiates the holy mass at the square of Christ the Redeemer in Santa Cruz, Bolivia on July 9, 2015.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559ebc13140000e3049a755f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pope Francis began a weeklong trip to Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay on Sunday, where he has focused much of his attention on the church's embrace of the poor, as well as promoting ecological awareness. But on issues of the family, the pontiff hinted that ""scandalous"" changes could be on the Catholic Church's horizon after bishops gather in Rome for a meeting on the topic later this year. The meeting is a continuation of a synod that began in fall of 2014 and which addressed contentious issues, such as allowing communion for divorced Catholics and extending a welcome to people in the LGBT community.The catechism, or official teaching, of the Catholic Church states that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered"" and that people attracted to the opposite sex must remain celibate. Pope Francis signaled a more understanding attitude, however, when he famously said in 2013: ""If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?"" In a sermon Monday in Guayaquil, Ecuador, the pope said the bishops will ""consider concrete solutions to the many difficult and significant challenges facing families in our time.""""I ask you to pray fervently for this intention,"" he said of the search for solutions, ""so that Christ can take even what might seem to us impure, scandalous or threatening, and turn it ... into a miracle. Families today need miracles!""Jesuit priest James Martin cautioned that it's still unclear what the pope meant, exactly, when he said change was on the horizon.""Notice that he said that God turns what we think is 'impure, threatening or scandalous' into something beautiful,"" Martin said in an email to HuffPost.""That could mean almost anything. Remember, though, that Jesus frequently went out to people seen as 'impure' (tax collectors, prostitutes, the sick) and healed them and restored them to the community. The Pope may be asking us to remember that God can do the same today.""Marianne Duddy-Burke, executive director of Catholic LGBT organization DignityUSA, said she thought the pope's statement sent ""clear signals"" that he recognizes the damage Catholic teaching does to LGBT familes.It's high time, she argued, the church amended its stance on LGBT issues in order to better serve the Catholic flock.""The current reality, where we are too often denied sacraments, means we are not full members of our Church,"" she told The Huffington Post. ""It’s time for the pain and alienation this causes to be stopped.""The church has showed signs recently, she added, ""that there may be openness to reconsidering the official stance on LGBT people and our families, as well as other kinds of families currently alienated by Church teachings."" Francis DeBernardo, executive director of LGBT Catholic organization New Ways Ministry, told HuffPost he wasn't expecting ""big policy changes"" at the synod in October. But he added that the debate, which got underway at the 2014 synod, signaled ""an important and big first step towards eventual changes down the road.""A drafted report released during the course of last year's meeting of bishops proposed greater openness toward divorced Catholics and members of the LGBT community. ""Homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer the Christian community,"" the document stated. ""Are we capable of welcoming these people, guaranteeing to them a further space in our communities?"" Many applauded the report as a ""revolutionary"" shift away from more condemning attitudes in the church, but celebration didn't last long. The bishops promptly backtracked on the document, rewording passages that seemed to stray too far from traditional teaching. Pope Francis welcomed the ""animated discussions"" the document engendered at the time, but warned against ""hostile inflexibility, that is, wanting to close oneself within the written word, (the letter) and not allowing oneself to be surprised by God.""Holy See press officer Tom Rosica said the pope asked for the entire document, including the rejected paragraphs, to be made public ""to show the degree of maturity that has taken place and that which still needs to take place in discussions over the coming year.""
