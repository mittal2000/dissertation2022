The case involves, Young, a former UPS driver who requested temporary assignment to avoid lifting heavy packages after she became pregnant. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e6eb22100003300c5ece9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"United Parcel Service Driver Peggy Young was likely more than ready for a whole host of changes -- bodily and otherwise -- when she first learned she was pregnant. But leaving her job wasn't one of them.After a doctor advised Young not lift more than 20 pounds while pregnant, she asked to be reassigned to light duty. Instead, UPS put her on unpaid leave. This action prompted Young to leave the company, and then -- citing protection under the 1968 Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) -- to sue. Now, this controversial case has reached the Supreme Court, where it is being debated on the national stage and raising new questions about sexism in the workplace.Young's case has garnered media and legal attention in part because of the larger, looming issues it touches on -- namely, how pregnant women and their bodies -- should be viewed and treated.Pregnancy Discrimination On The RiseWhile Young's case is currently experiencing a fever pitch of visibility, her story is far from an anomaly. The 2009 case Heather Wiseman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. revolved around a pregnant sales associate in Salina, Kansas, who suffered from bladder and urinary infections, and was advised by her doctor to carry around a water bottle to stay hydrated. When she was repeatedly denied the right to do so and ended up hydrating anyways, she was fired on account of ""insubordination.""In 2007, an activity director at a nursing home in Valparaiso, Indiana, was let go when told her bosses she could no longer do heavy lifting or other strenuous activities -- on her doctor's orders so as not to suffer a second miscarriage.Beyond the anecdotal, there is empirical evidence of persistent discrimination as well. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, ""in the years since the PDA was enacted, charges alleging pregnancy discrimination have increased substantially,"" and ""discrimination complaints have risen at a faster rate than the steady influx of women into the workplace... [which] suggests that pregnant workers continue to face inequality in the workplace.""According to the National Women's Law Center, charges of pregnancy discrimination filed with the EEOC rose from 4,160 in FY 2000 to 6,119 in FY 2010. (Interestingly -- in a case of racism colliding with sexism--claims by women of color jumped 76 percent between fiscal years 1996 and 2005, accounting for much of the 25 percent increase in pregnancy discrimination allegations during that same period).So what gives? And could the PDA itself be to blame?Laying Down The LawPDA's primary aim is simple and ostensibly sound: ""prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy."" Specifically, it states:""The terms 'because of sex' or 'on the basis of sex' include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work...""The problem with this is that it demands a comparison between a pregnant woman and another person with a temporary disability--and this strain for neutrality fails to address pregnancy as something entirely unique. It is, after all, not a disability. In the brilliantly -- if clunkily -- titled Pacific McGeorge School of Law paper ""Until Men Bear Children, Women Must Not Bear the Costs of Reproductive Capacity,"" Mayon Oyoung argues:""A major problem with current [PDA] law is that there is no similarly situated class to pregnant women. In pregnancy and female reproductive issues, 'there can be no precise comparator by reason of the different reproductive capacities of men and women...' Because symptoms and conditions vary among pregnant women, and even between pregnancies for the same woman, finding a similarly situated non-pregnant person is often not possible. Many legitimate pregnancy discrimination claims fail due to the inability to find a legally acceptable comparator.""UPS's strain for ""neutrality"" is even more dubious. The company's lawyer, Caitlin Halligan, has argued that the company was simply striving for fairness by extending the same rights to Young as it would to anybody else injured off the job. But is being pregnant really the same as getting an off-the-clock injury? And doesn't this, in a sense, tell women it's their ""fault"" for getting pregnant, and not the company's? Framing pregnancy as a synonymous condition to bodily injury is a dangerous and erroneous mind-set to perpetuate.Justice Samuel Alito took this line of thinking a step further when he asked if there was ""really a dispute that if a UPS driver fell off his all-terrain vehicle"" at home on the weekend, he would not get a ""light-duty"" accommodation while he recovered from his off-duty shenanigans.Let's be clear here: Getting pregnant is not akin to taking a joy ride on an ATV. It's not something women to do to let off steam on the weekend, but a deeply personal choice bound by profound responsibility. It's also something we like to call a biological necessity. The fact that a Supreme Court Justice was so dismissive of pregnancy reveals a deep bias and profound lack of understanding that is likely at the heart of enduring discrimination.And yes, this lack of understanding and inability to parse out the differences between pregnancy and off-duty injuries seems to be distinctly gendered. Men like the male justices and UPS bosses -- who have the luxury of knowing, on an instinctual level, that they will never have to endure the burden of child-bearing -- have taken the most stringent stance against protections for pregnant women. It should come as no surprise that the two justices ""most sympathetic"" to Young's plight were women -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan -- though Kagan herself has never even been pregnant.(Interestingly enough, pro-lifers are  rallying around Young, insisting that life deserves to be fiercely protected vis-a-vis the protection of pregnant women.)Justice Antonin Scalia, for his part, was as dismissive as Alito, sarcastically noting that Young was asking for ""most-favored-nation status,"" basically sniffing at the notion that pregnant women be treated as something special. But aren't they? Surely, no other physical condition is truly similar to the act of incubating human life, and the process of pregnancy is by its very nature a singular and remarkable act.(Not to put too fine a point on it, but if women didn't get pregnant, none of the male corporate bosses or Supreme Court Justices busily discriminating against pregnant women would even exist.)As of now, at least nine states explicitly require employers to essentially treat pregnant women as ""special,"" by going out of their way to accommodate them, with similar laws under review in a half-dozen other states. There is evidence that this approach is effective; in California, which has mandated providing reasonable accommodation to pregnant women since 2000 (allowing them to take bathroom breaks and sit rather than stand for instance) pregnancy discrimination charges have dropped.Until this ethos -- that pregnant women are indeed special, not damaged, and deserve to be treated as such -- becomes enshrined in the language of the federal law, there will no doubt be many more cases like Young's. It's worth asking what kind of nation we are, if we aren't committed to fully protecting and respecting women responsible for creating the next generation of our society. Life should never be created under duress and discrimination.This story first appeared at Ravishly.com, a community for women that strives to foster a dialogue between disparate voices and experiences."

(Photograph by Charles Ommanney/Reportage by Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea27e200000e500ff583e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Border Patrol officers kicked Maria out of the country, they didn’t have to go before a judge or allow her to see a lawyer. They only had to file an expedited removal order to deport her. She was a U.S. citizen, but U.S. officials didn’t believe her because the only language she spoke was Spanish. It took her years of legal wrangling to return. Two other women, deported in a similarly speedy fashion, were gang-raped and shot after they were deported to Guatemala. These and other cases are detailed in a report published Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union, which says the U.S. government routinely deports people with legitimate legal claims to stay in the country. The report only gives the first names of the interviewees. Based on a review of 136 cases, the ACLU report says the transition toward summary removal procedures since the 1990s has made it common for authorities to wrongly deport asylum seekers, people with strong U.S. ties and, in at least one case, a U.S. citizen.Prior to a 1996 law called the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, the vast majority of those issued a deportation order faced a hearing with a judge, the report says. Now, some 83 percent of deportation orders are issued through rapid-fire removal processes that don’t involve a judge. The report says the trend means that the details of individual cases can get ignored. For example, the ACLU report says that border officials commonly fail to screen asylum seekers who have what authorities refer to as a “credible fear” of returning to their country of origin. Those who pass a credible fear screening are allowed to enter the United States while their asylum cases move forward. Some 55 percent of the 89 interviewees deported summarily at the border said U.S. officials never asked if they feared returning to their home countries, or that they didn’t understand the questions because of language difficulties. Of those who were asked, some 40 percent say they weren’t referred to an asylum officer and were instead immediately deported. “These summary procedures invite, and guarantee, error. And yet erroneous -- even illegal -- summary removal orders are difficult to challenge because of the speed of the process, the limited “evidence” required, and the absence of a complete record of the proceeding… Asylum seekers, longtime residents, and others with rights to be in the United States can be deported without a hearing in a matter of minutes.”The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The report recommends immigration enforcement officials to adopt a policy of offering full hearings before immigration judges to those who have strong claims to remain in the country, including asylum seekers, people with U.S.-citizen family and those who have lived here for long periods of time. The report also recommends training immigration enforcement officers not to use coercion or threats to prod people to accept deportation voluntarily, when in fact they may have the right to see a judge. The ACLU also asks federal officials to reduce criminal prosecutions for illegal entry and illegal re-entry in order to avoid prosecuting people before they have a chance to present claims to stay in the country. Immigration offenses are currently the most commonly prosecuted crimes on the federal docket. Read the full ACLU report here."

""We're very proud of the fact that 91 cents of every dollar that's donated goes to our services,"" Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern said in a speech in Baltimore last year. ""That's world class, obviously.""McGovern has often repeated that figure, which has also appeared on the charity's website. ""I'm really proud"" that overhead expenses are so low, she told a Cleveland audience in June.The problem with that number: It isn't true.After inquiries by ProPublica and NPR, the Red Cross removed the statement from its website. The Red Cross said the claim was not ""as clear as it could have been, and we are clarifying the language.""The Red Cross declined repeated requests to say the actual percentage of donor dollars going to humanitarian services.But the charity's own financial statements show that overhead expenses are significantly more than what McGovern and other Red Cross officials have claimed.In recent years, the Red Cross' fundraising expenses alone have been as high as 26 cents of every donated dollar, nearly three times the nine cents in overhead claimed by McGovern. In the past five years, fundraising expenses have averaged 17 cents per donated dollar.But even that understates matters. Once donated dollars are in Red Cross hands, the charity spends additional money on ""management and general"" expenses, which includes things like back office accounting. That means the portion of donated dollars going to overhead is even higher.Just how high is impossible to know because the Red Cross doesn't break down its spending on overhead and declined ProPublica and NPR's request to do so. The difference between the real number and the one the Red Cross has been repeating ""would be very stark,"" says Daniel Borochoff of the watchdog group CharityWatch. ""They don't want to be embarrassed.""Read the rest of the story at ProPublica. "

Let's try and keep the joy in the season by being mindful of these three joy-killers when it comes to the holidays and your credit.Mistake #1 - Falling into the trap of opening new credit accounts. If you are like most Americans, you have plenty of open credit card and store card accounts and probably do not need any more. However, it becomes so tempting to get the free gift or discount, especially when it seems we get asked and offered such great incentives 30 times a day while we're out holiday shopping. Remember to stick to your plan and if using your store credit or signing up for one is part of your plan to build and maintain healthy credit, then by all means take advantage of the benefits. But if not, just set your mind to it that every time you are offered you will politely say 'no, thank you.' Remember that if you can anticipate all the offers now and plan your response, you will be less tempted to sign on for something that doesn't fit in with your plan for building healthy credit.Mistake #2 - Not expecting the unexpected.We've all been there and for me it still seems to happen every year. I think I've made my full list of gift for family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, clients, teachers all the way to the postman, my hairstylist. Yet I always seem to forget someone or get a last minute party invitation and need a little white owl gift. It's endless and the only way for my budget to survive all of this unplanned spending is to plan for the unexpected. For example, say you'll have ten unplanned gifts or whatever you think is realistic and the average you might spend on them and include that figure in your holiday budget. You may even want to keep the cash equivalent in a special envelope so you can quickly go to it without having to try and remember how much you have in the budget and instead reach for the credit card.  Mistake #3 - Holiday spending ruining your New Year's plansHave you set any financial goals for the New Year? Do you plan to buy or refinance a home? Send a kid to college? Replace an aging car? Opening up a bunch of new credit accounts, having too many credit inquiries, running up high balances on your revolving credit accounts, and paying credit cards late could put a major damper on those plans by dropping your credit score. It's great to get caught up in the joy of the holiday season but not in the over-indulgence to the point that it will hurt your financial plans for the New Year. So, this year, make sure you have a set budget for holiday shopping and know exactly how you will pay for it, then stick to your plans. Your joy will overflow throughout the coming weeks, even into the New Year!"

I'm not even saying it's a bad thing. It just is."" Rock discusses the well-known, but under-addressed issue of diversity in Hollywood and how black people, women and especially black women rarely see themselves on screen. He talked about the racial double standard black women face when they go through casting: [How] about ""True Detective""? I never heard anyone go, ""Is it going to be Amy Adams or Gabrielle Union?"" for that show. I didn't hear one black girl's name on those lists. Not one. Literally everyone in town was up for that part, unless you were black. And I haven't read the script, but something tells me if Gabrielle Union were Colin Farrell's wife, it wouldn't change a thing. And there are almost no black women in film. You can go to whole movies and not see one black woman. They'll throw a black guy a bone. OK, here's a black guy. But is there a single black woman in ""Interstellar""? Or ""Gone Girl""? ""Birdman""? ""The Purge""? ""Neighbors""? I'm not sure there are. I don't remember them. I go to the movies almost every week, and I can go a month and not see a black woman having an actual speaking part in a movie. That's the truth.This world needs more Chris Rocks in it ASAP.

(Photo by Scott Halleran/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb775fd250000940039e879.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tiger Woods returns to competitive golf at this weekend's Hero World Challenge, an 18-man field composed of golfers in the top 50 of the world rankings. After a spectacular 2013 season that included five first place finishes, a second place finish, not missing any cuts on the PGA Tour and finishing second in the FedEx standings, 2014 was another story. Tiger missed most of the year due to a back injury that included major surgery, Woods competed in only seven PGA Tour tournaments and ranked 218th in the FedEx standings. As Woods makes his return to the links this weekend, what can we expect? Woods spoke to the media on Tuesday, and he's ready to go. A few key takeaways from the press conference: - When asked about his back, Tiger said, ""It feels great. It feels fantastic."" - When asked if his best golf is behind him, Tiger said, ""You can win at a late age because you don't have to dominate anyone. You just have to beat the golf course... I still have time."" - When asked about his new swing he's been working on with his new coach Chris Como, Tiger said, ""My body feels excited about (the swing) because it's an old motor pattern. Ball is coming off the clubface faster.""In 2011, in an interview with The Golf Channel, I predicted a Tiger Woods comeback while many others said he was done. I was right that time and I am right again, and I'll say it right now and on the record: Tiger Woods will be back again and dominate the game of golf like the Tiger of old. I am also predicting that in the next 10 years, he will go on to break Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major championship wins. Even Jack Nicklaus believes Tiger will do it. In an interview in August, Nicklaus said, ""I just think he's too talented, too focused, to not do it.""In addition, here's what else separates Woods from the majority of other PGA Tour professionals:- Mental Toughness: The pros know that what goes on in between your ears can make a huge difference in the final outcome. And while all world-class performers need to possess a certain level of mental toughness, no one in golf has it like Tiger Woods. He's the master of this and we've seen him exhibit world-class mental toughness and do the impossible over and over again. - Ability to Handle Adversity: If there's one person in golf who has been handed adversity and triumphed time and again, it's Tiger Woods. Granted, some of those obstacles were personal and self-inflicted, but his personal wrongdoings of the past are behind him. And on the course, few other professional golfers have dominated time after time like Woods. Adversity has been Tiger Woods' mental training ground. His back problems last year will be transformed into another success story of overcoming yet another obstacle for him. The stress and struggles of the past are going to make him even tougher.- Hardwired Like Few Others: Woods is hard-wired through years of world-class programming to focus on a vision and persevere at any cost. He doesn't understand what giving up is. His dad, the late Earl Woods, programmed him for one thing: winning. It has been six years since Tiger last won a major, but I can guarantee you he's never taken his eye off of Nickalus' record.- Talent: People can argue this all day long, but Tiger Woods is the most talented professional golfer ever. That's not to say there aren't a lot of talented pros who have done some extraordinary things on the golf course. But in the end, on the physical plain, Woods has perseverance. On the mental plane, he has toughness and on the spiritual plane, he has artistry like no one else.Finally, if that's not enough to make the case for a Tiger comeback, a bet against a champion like Tiger Woods is always a bad bet. It might take him a few tournaments to work out the kinks and get his old footing back, but expect some very big things from Tiger in 2015. As professional golfer Sam Snead said, ""The mark of a great player is in his ability to come back. The great champions have all come back from defeat."""

The metamorphosis of Clinton into Obama is amazing to see. First, endlessly cite the mid-terms elections not as a rebuff of Obama's performance and popularity but of Clinton's. Next, tirelessly cite polls and surveys that variously show that Clinton's favorability and popularity has steadily dropped. Then repeatedly tell everyone that she's not quite as ""invincible"" as she once seemed. Then lambaste Obama for his alleged imperial use of executive orders to skirt Congress, his immigration reform action, and meddling in Ferguson. Then rehash the Benghazi debacle reminding one and all that though Clinton was the Secretary of State when the attack happened, it still happened on Obama's watch and that both supposedly colluded to obfuscate, misdirect and cover-up the alleged foreign policy bungle and lapse that caused the loss of American lives.Hillary got solid popularity numbers when she was out of the public eye and therefore other than Benghazi was not an easy target for vilification. But now that she very much is in the public eye, the ploy is to tightly saddle her with Obama, and remind that the political landscape has supposedly radically changed with the GOP mid-term wave. The intended takeaway is that Hillary is anything but a shoo-in for the White House, and even more politically suggestive might be ripe for an intra-party challenge for the Democratic presidential nomination from another Democratic contender. The notion that Obama is toxic for Clinton is not new. It actually started before the mid-terms. It began with tell all quips from some of her 2008 campaign staffers that she kept an ""enemies list"" of Democrats who switched hats and jumped to the Obama camp in 2008. Supposedly, these prominent turncoat Democrats from Ted Kennedy to John Lewis were a prime cause of her 2008 Democratic primary defeat. Her stint as Obama's point person on foreign policy didn't change the supposed political enmity between her and Obama. This is fed with constant talk that Clinton has back peddled fast from Obama on foreign policy hot issues from Syria to Iran but all the while mindful that he is still the president, the titular head of the Democratic Party. More importantly, popularity slide or no, he will still be needed for campaign funding, logistic and party unity support for her presumptive 2016 White House bid. This sets up the classic political trap for Clinton. She is damned if she moves to far away from Obama, at the risk of alienating him and party leaders. She is damned if she hitches her wagon to him given his supposed unpopularity.The two keys to make this ploy work is first to sow doubt and dissension about Hillary among two key voter groups that are crucial to the Democrat's rebound in 2016. One of which are the voters that Obama has been a hard sell with. They are white male, blue-collar voters in swing states. The white male blue-collar voters in those states are still crucial to a Democratic presidential candidate's White House success. Obama did poorly with them in 2008 and did even poorer with them in 2012. The other group is women. He's had much success with women voters and the assumption is that Hillary would do the same if not better with them. To undercut that, the GOP has waved figures that purport to show that more women are receptive to the GOP than in times past. As with other voters, Obama and his alleged ruinous policies supposedly have made the GOP for many women the far better alternative to the Democrats. The other key is to sow the same seeds and dissension among Democrats to get them to question whether Clinton could ever distance herself from Obama and sell herself to the voters as her own candidate with an agenda and a persona that truly would be a change from Obama. To drive that point home, names, most prominently Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, are tossed out to show that there are other Democrats who have taken positions at times at odds with Obama's on the issues and could give her a run for her money.The GOP banks on one more ploy to hit Hillary with Obama. That's to turn the tables and remind voters of what happened to GOP presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. He had the colossal misfortune of being typed in the eyes of voters as being the water carrier for the cataclysmic bumbles, fumbles, and stumbles of Bush Jr. And that a McCain win would be bring more of the same misery if he was elected. In other words, the terror of a Bush third term with the name McCain soured many voters on McCain.   The same image is being cynically and calculatedly drummed home by pairing Hillary and Obama. Hillary will be her own candidate and run her own campaign if she runs, but that won't stop the GOP from trying to smear her with Obama.--Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

(AP) — Police and social services in Silicon Valley are starting to clear away what likely had been the nation's largest homeless encampment.Animal control and a construction contractor are also helping dismantle the square-mile site that once was home to more than 200 homeless people, San Jose homelessness response manager Ray Bramson said.People living in the camp, known as The Jungle, were told Monday they must be out by Thursday or face arrest for trespassing. The encampment stands in stark contrast to its surrounding area in the heart of the Silicon Valley, a region leading the country for job growth, income, innovation and venture capital.In a walkthrough earlier this week, officials found there were 60 people left in the camp. They didn't know how many remained after Monday.Officials will try to find people who have been involved in social services some kind of shelter for the night. Bramson says those not involved in social services ""are going to have to leave today anyways.""There have been no reports of violence or people refusing to leave.The team will first go through the hand-built structures and tents looking for cash, IDs or anything else of value. Those items will be sorted and stored for people to claim later.In the past year and a half, the city of San Jose has spent more than $4 million on solving the problems at the encampment.The last time officials cleared out the camp was in May 2012 when about 150 people were moved out of The Jungle.Bramson said earlier this week that increased violence, wet weather and unsanitary conditions make it imperative the camp is cleared. In the last month, one resident tried to strangle someone with a cord of wire down there, he said. Another was nearly beaten to death with a hammer. And the State Water Resources Control Board has been demanding that polluted Coyote Creek, which cuts through the middle, get cleaned out.City officials plan to send in trash trucks and bulldozers to haul out tons of hazardous and human waste. They will use heavy machinery to fill excavated sections where people have been living underground. And they will try to restore the creek beds."

The same can be said for lessons, which sometimes arrive as unexpected gifts from our beautiful boys -- and girls. That's what I learned nearly a decade ago when I took my then 8-year-old daughter, Ella, to Central Park's Strawberry Fields on the Dec. 8, 2005, the 25th anniversary of John's death. I'd stopped by the park on Dec. 8 pretty much ever year since 1980, but never with Ella, whom my wife, Theresa Wozunk, and I raised as a Beatle Baby since birth. We'd spared Ella this annual ritual, even as we embarked on familial Magical Mystery Tours to Liverpool, London and Hamburg. Only two months before, Ella unexpectedly met Paul McCartney, producing a sweet tale that traveled around the world. Now, I decided, Ella needed to experience another part of the Beatle story.***As I walked hand-in-hand with Ella past the Dakota in the early December chill, memory transported me back to 1980, when I was a 14-year-old high school freshman.It was nearly 11:30 p.m., and a school night. But that didn't stop my younger brother, Drew, and me from our weeknight ritual of secreting ourselves in his room, huddled around our 12-inch black-and-white Zenith TV. With the volume turned down to a whisper, we waited for ""Prisoner Cell Block H"" to begin on Channel 11. We were moments into the latest jailhouse melodrama when words to this effect crawled across the bottom of the screen: ""A man tentatively identified as former Beatle John Lennon has been reported shot on the Upper West Side and rushed to Roosevelt Hospital.""The 11 p.m. news broadcasts were over. CNN was about six months old -- not that we had cable TV in our working-class corner of Brooklyn.But ABC's ""Monday Night Football"" was still on. The words ""tentatively identified"" and the lack of the word ""dead"" gave me some optimism as the dial clicked four times under my hand to Channel 7. Howard Cosell quickly dashed those hopes:""Remember, this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses,"" Cosell began in his voice-of-authority nasal tones. ""An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous, perhaps, of all the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival.""I pounded downstairs past my father, still in his mailman's uniform, eating dinner off the tray table in front of his Archie Bunker-like easy chair as he watched ""The Tonight Show.""""What the hell are you doing?"" he shouted.""Somebody shot John Lennon,"" I said. ""He's dead.""""Oh,"" my father replied, taking his attention off Johnny Carson's monologue for just a moment. ""Well, it's too damn late to play any records. Go to sleep!""I jumped into bed and turned on my clock radio, making sure I kept the volume down on my makeshift pillow speaker.I flipped from radio station to radio station -- WPLJ, WNEW, WABC -- listening to the DJs struggle with their emotions, field calls from weeping fans and play John's music. Meanwhile, scores massed outside the Dakota brandishing candles and singing John's songs.I wanted to be there. But there was no question I would be staying put. My father usually stayed up through Tom Snyder's ""Tomorrow Show,"" which didn't end until 2 a.m. I wasn't going to sneak out of the house and take a train to a place I wasn't even sure how to find. Not in 1980 New York. Not at age 14.***I began to wonder whether I was making a mistake as Ella and I walked into the packed park. The turnout was the biggest I'd seen since the first anniversary vigil. Thanks to both the crowd and the cops, the line leading up the ""Imagine"" mosaic was as orderly as it was long. As we got closer, the candles made it almost seem like we were approaching a round patch of daylight, to a soundtrack of Beatles songs provided by hundreds of voices and dozens of jangling acoustic guitars.""I can't see!"" Ella said.Someone overheard her. ""Hey, there's a little girl trying to get in!"" a woman said, and the message began to travel up the line.Suddenly, cops cleared us a path. We stopped a moment and took in the light, flowers, photos and fan art that obscured the mosaic.I looked into Ella's gray-blue eyes. She was smiling. Ella was cold and tired -- but happy. For her, it was another fun Beatle day: full of music, nice people, a certain amount of physical discomfort and a pleasant surprise. For her, this gathering represented a celebration.In that moment, 25 years of sorrow -- or something -- lifted. Believing in yesterday is fine, but living for the moment and embracing the future is where it's at.I was thinking about the future that night when I extracted from Ella a vow I hope she'll keep.""I need you to make me a promise,"" I told her. ""I took you here tonight. I want you to take me here in 25 years, on Dec. 8, 2030.""When I'm 64.""Adapted from ""Raising a Beatle Baby: How John, Paul, George and Ringo Helped us Come Together as a Family"" by Jere Hester.

Yes, all 39 of them.And, as always, these projections are subject to change — especially because it's still not entirely clear how the College Football Playoff will ultimately come together and it's common for some conferences to not always be able to fill all of their bowl tie-ins.Key* Replacement team for a conference that cannot fill its bowl slot.— If bowl-eligible, Army will play in the Armed Forces Bowl, Navy will play in the Poinsettia Bowl and BYU will play in the Miami Beach Bowl.Note: One team from the so-called Group of Five (American Athletic, MAC, Mountain West, Conference USA and Sun Belt) will get chosen for either the Cotton, Fiesta or Peach Bowl.The College Football PlayoffSemifinal—Jan. 1 Rose (Pasadena): No. 2 Oregon vs. No. 3 Florida StateSemifinal—Jan. 1 Sugar (New Orleans): No. 1 Alabama vs. No. 4 TCUChampionship—Jan. 12 (Arlington): The winners of the two semifinals meetThe CFP Selection Committee bowl gamesDec. 31 Peach (Atlanta): Ohio State (At-Large) vs. Mississippi State (At-Large)Dec. 31 Orange (Miami): Georgia Tech (ACC) vs. Michigan State (Big Ten/SEC/Notre Dame)Dec. 31 Fiesta (Glendale): Arizona (At-Large) vs. Boise State (At-Large)Jan. 1 Cotton (Arlington): Baylor (At-Large) vs. Wisconsin (At-Large)The rest of the bowl slateDec. 20 New Orleans (New Orleans): Louisiana-Lafayette (Sun Belt) vs. *Temple (MWC)Dec. 20 Idaho Potato (Boise): Utah State (MWC) vs. Western Michigan (MAC)Dec. 20 Las Vegas (Las Vegas): Colorado State (MWC No. 1) vs. Utah (Pac-12 No. 6)Dec. 20 New Mexico (Albuquerque): Air Force (MWC) vs. UTEP (C-USA)Dec. 20 Camellia (Montgomery): Central Michigan (MAC) vs. South Alabama (Sun Belt/ACC)Dec. 22 Miami Beach (Miami): Memphis (American) vs. BYU (BYU)Dec. 23 Poinsettia (San Diego): San Diego State (MWC) vs. Navy (Navy)Dec. 23 Boca Raton (Boca Raton): Marshall (C-USA) vs. Toledo (MAC)Dec. 24 Bahamas (Nassau): Rice (C-USA) vs. Bowling Green (MAC)Dec. 24 Hawaii (Honolulu): Fresno State (MWC) vs. Western Kentucky (C-USA)Dec. 26 Quick Lane (Detroit): Boston College (ACC Nos. 7-9/MAC) vs. Illinois (Big Ten Nos. 8-9/MAC)Dec. 26 Bitcoin (St. Petersburg): UCF (American) vs. NC State (C-USA/ACC No. 10)Dec. 26 Zaxby’s (Dallas): Rutgers (Big Ten Nos. 8-9/Big 12) vs. Louisiana Tech (C-USA)Dec. 27 Military (Annapolis): Virginia Tech (ACC Nos. 7-9) vs. Cincinnati (American)Dec. 27 Independence (Shreveport): Pitt (ACC Nos. 7-9) vs. Texas A&M (SEC Nos. 9-10/C-USA)Dec. 27 Pinstripe (New York): Duke (ACC Nos. 3-6) vs. Penn State (Big Ten Nos. 5-7)Dec. 27 Sun (El Paso): North Carolina (ACC Nos. 3-6) vs. Arizona State (Pac-12 No. 5)Dec. 27 Holiday (San Diego): Iowa (Big Ten Nos. 2-4) vs. USC (Pac-12 No. 3)Dec. 29 Russell Athletic (Orlando): Louisville (ACC No. 2) vs. Kansas State (Big 12 No. 3)Dec. 29 Liberty (Memphis): West Virginia (Big 12 No. 5) vs. Tennessee (SEC Nos. 3-8)Dec. 29 Texas (Houston): Texas (Big 12 No. 4) vs. LSU (SEC Nos. 3-8)Dec. 30 Belk (Charlotte): Notre Dame (ACC Nos. 3-6) vs. Georgia (SEC Nos. 3-8)Dec. 30 Foster Farms (Santa Clara): Nebraska (Big Ten Nos. 5-7) vs. Stanford (Pac-12 No. 4)Dec. 30 Music City (Nashville): Miami, FL (ACC Nos. 3-6/Big Ten) vs. South Carolina (SEC Nos. 3-8)Jan. 1 Citrus (Orlando): Clemson (ACC No. 2) vs. Missouri (SEC No. 2)Jan. 1 Outback (Tampa): Minnesota (Big Ten Nos. 2-4) vs. Auburn (SEC Nos. 3-8)Jan. 2 Armed Forces (Fort Worth): Houston (American) vs. *Florida (Army/Big 12 No. 7)Jan. 2 Alamo (San Antonio): Oklahoma (Big 12 No. 2) vs. UCLA (Pac-12 No. 2)Jan. 2 TaxSlayer (Jacksonville): Maryland (ACC/Big Ten Nos. 5-7) vs. Ole Miss (SEC Nos. 3-8)Jan. 2 Cactus (Tempe): *Nevada (Big 12 No. 6) vs. Washington (Pac-12 No. 7)Jan. 3 Birmingham (Birmingham): Arkansas (SEC Nos. 9-10) vs. East Carolina (American)Jan. 4 GoDaddy (Mobile): Northern Illinois (MAC No. 1) vs. Arkansas State (Sun Belt)Dave Miller, the college football editor for the National Football Post, is on Twitter @Miller_Dave."

(Photo by Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cf83330240000120f859021.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was in Ferguson Wednesday when it happened: In a morally stunning decision,  a Staten Island grand jury announced it would not bring criminal charges against a white police officer who choked a black man to death during a brutal incident last July. Stopped for allegedly selling some loose and therefore untaxed cigarettes, officer Daniel Pantaleo put a ""chokehold"" on Eric Garner, despite the fact that the move is against NYPD rules. Video of the incident shows Garner uttering his last words, ""I can't breathe."" New York's medical examiner officially called this a ""homicide,"" but the grand jury said no charges will be made.Of course, this comes just 10 days after the Ferguson grand jury decision not to indict another white police officer, Darren Wilson, for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown on Aug. 9. Sojourners had convened a retreat in Ferguson for both national faith leaders and local pastors to look deeply at the historical and theological foundations of the Ferguson events and reflect upon how the church must respond. Emotional calls from pastors in New York City came with the horrible news, and people just began to weep -- one young man wailing, ""This time it was all on video .... and it still didn't matter! How can I as a black man bring a black son into this world?"" Lament and prayers followed with a resolve from an extraordinary two days on the ground in Ferguson -- to act.Local experts in St. Louis County helped us understand the damage done to their local communities for decades that led to the response that erupted after the killing of Michael Brown. We walked silently and prayerfully alongside the memorial to the slain teenager on West Canfield Avenue with black parents imagining their own sons lying there, and white parents realizing this would never happen to our kids. We kept looking at the street where this bloody incident had taken place, feeling more and more doubt about the narratives the county prosecutor had used to exonerate and excuse the white police officer from any responsibility -- or at least a trial to publically sort out ""conflicting testimonies.""We met in a church with seven young leaders of the Ferguson protest movement. In just 116 days, these young people had become self-educated and extraordinary leaders, and we listened to a compelling analysis of their urgent situation and how they were trying to apply the history of social movements to change their oppressive circumstances. Their chilling stories of police harassment and brutality, preceded by a narrative of the educational and economic brutality that black young people like them experience daily were transforming words for those of us who listened, spellbound. As I listened, I realized America would be converted by these young people's honest and earnest conversation -- they would win the national debate about our criminal justice system's response to young people of color. And that is why they have been deliberately marginalized and painted with the brush of false narratives that polarize our responses to them, a polarization so painfully and starkly now along racial lines.Some of these young people had just returned from Washington, D.C., where they met in the Oval Office with the president. Later I joined them for a small meeting at the White House where the president convened faith leaders, law enforcement officials, legal scholars, the vice president, and some of his cabinet secretaries to discuss a new task force and national commission to deal with what he called ""a real problem"" in our law enforcement system between too many police departments and their communities of color.You could tell these young people made a profound impression on Barack Obama, and they were powerfully articulate in our meeting, calling Ferguson a historical moment and asking us all how we were going to respond to it. What happened in Ferguson was no anomaly of course, and there are Fergusons all over the nation. But Ferguson has become a historically revealing moment about what has been true for decades across this country in the ways that young black men and women are treated profoundly differently than young white men and women. It's a truth everyone in the African-American community understands, but many white Americans are still mostly unaware of or in deep denial about.The faith leaders retreat resulted in new and determined commitments to change --beginning with the churches themselves and extending to a criminal justice system whose racial bias is beyond dispute. That commitment will go beyond our racial and political differences and could hopefully provide a most needed multiracial and non-partisan political force for fundamental change. Conservative white Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore said this about Ferguson:""In the public arena, we ought to recognize that it is empirically true that African-American men are more likely, by virtually every measure, to be arrested, sentenced, executed, or murdered than their white peers. We cannot shrug that off with apathy. Working toward justice in this arena will mean consciences that are sensitive to the problem. But how can we get there when white people do not face the same experiences as do black people?""Wednesday, in response to the Staten Island decision, he added:""... a government that can choke a man to death on video for selling cigarettes is not a government living up to a biblical definition of justice or any recognizable definition of justice. ... It's time for us in Christian churches to not just talk about the gospel but live out the gospel by tearing down these dividing walls not only by learning and listening to one another but also by standing up and speaking out for one another.""Amen brother Russell. Amen.When the decision about Eric Garner was announced, the young people we had met the night before called and asked us to join them in the protest they had just organized at a U.S. Courthouse in downtown St. Louis -- and we did. Faith leaders and pastors stood alongside black and white young people who chanted ""I can't breathe"" in front of a line of police.America, we have a problem. It's past time to fix it, and the church must stand alongside a new generation of young leaders and help the nation find the way forward.Jim Wallis is president of Sojourners.

Eager for answers throughout this painstaking ordeal, the black citizens of Ferguson and other voices from across the nation were calling for unbiased due process in the investigation into the shooting of their ""son."" Attorney Benjamin Crump, representing Brown's family, implored Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to assign a special prosecutor to the case, one who is not intimately involved with the Ferguson Police Department on a day-to-day basis. He called for, at the very least, an appearance of fairness. Yet his pleas fell on deaf ears. Michael Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, attempting to console his wife after the announcement by the county prosecutor that there would be no indictment of the man who killed her son, became visibly overcome with grief himself and unbridled his passions. Unleashing his pent-up anger, he bellowed, ""Burn this b**** down!"" A war cry that's well known among the dispossessed, this demand for justice is born out of the black struggle against the preponderance of everyday forms of institutionalized white racism. The news outlets have tried to characterize his words as the ignition that incited a weary crowd to violence. Whether you believe his cries to be literal or figurative, the rebellion was inevitable regardless of his statements, because what is hidden beneath this sound bite are decades of black rage and frustration over blocked opportunities and the denial of equal access to decent jobs, high-quality education, health care and other resources that white Americans ignorantly take for granted. Instead, what black Americans have come to expect from their homeland is continued discrimination in virtually every sphere of society and the subsequent white denial of the existence of said discrimination. In this context, Mike Brown's death stands as a symbol for any black youth who has ever found himself or herself accosted by our racially exclusive social structure. In this case, the criminal-justice system has been woefully unfair and outright hostile to the concerns of black Americans and other Americans of color.The African-American experience of North America was born from violent encounters with elite white men and their unrelenting quest for power, control and economic supremacy in what would later evolve into our free-market capitalist empire. This monumental achievement by such a young nation came by way of genocidal campaigns against Native Americans for their land and the enslavement of Africans for their labor power. Today most Americans underestimate the foundational and destructive nature of systemic white racism and how it is reproduced with each proceeding generation. Black folks have had centuries of violence inflicted upon them by their nation and each other. The people grow tired and impatient, and, left with few other options, they ultimately dissent. It was almost 50 years ago that the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles went up in flames. The 1965 Watts riots marked the turning point in the civil-rights movement when black Americans had had enough and chose to fight violence with violence. Though the riots were set off by a particular act of police violence against a handful of black citizens, the California governor recognized that the main source of the anger that fueled the riots was the broader context of high unemployment, poor schooling and inadequate housing for blacks in the city. Not much had changed 27 years later when rioting once again erupted in the area following the acquittal of the four officers who brutally beat the late Rodney King in plain view of their dash cam. And not much has changed in the 49 years since the initial riots. An extended history of violence exacted on black Americans has found its way to the millennial generation. This modern-day riot is in line with Bayard Rustin's 1966 observation that the unequivocal purpose of the Watts riots was to ""no longer quietly submit to the deprivation...."" Just as Rodney King was called upon to appeal for peace with his famous remark ""Can we all get along?"", Michael Brown Sr. had a similar request of the people of Ferguson. But in the end these urgings fell silent, because the riot was bigger than this one moment in time. The unrest is ultimately the result of systemic inequalities that have long determined African Americans' standing in society, relegating them to a position as America's most disenfranchised group. Four hundred years of violence and oppression cannot be assuaged by a few public appeals. Calm and peaceful demonstrations constitute a strategy that eventually runs its course as an effective means of being heard. Black Americans are repeatedly expected to exercise restraint and show patience in the face of white brutality -- this after years of suffering and oppression. But after a series of tragedies involving black men and boys dying at the hands of white law-enforcement officers (or community watchmen), very little has been done. Black folks remained calm through Oscar Grant and remained calm through Trayvon Martin. They remained calm through Eric Gardner and Dante Parker and John Crawford. And still no action was taken.What is happening in Ferguson is a result of the unfinished business of the civil-rights movement. The process is unjust, and laws have been systematically stripped away, undoing many of the provisions that protected minorities from white terror. Many blacks feel they have been denied all legitimate means of civic redress; thus they have no other appropriate venue to express their angst. Malcolm X warned a generation ago that it's a question of ""either the ballot or the bullet."" It is not merely coincidental that the rioters' first act of defiance was to set two Ferguson patrol cars on fire; this aggressive act epitomizes the deep mistrust that the citizens of Ferguson and other cities have of their own police force, which is supposedly sworn to ""protect and serve"" its residents. Gone are the days of the community police who were a part of the people. The real perpetrators of violence in U.S. society are those with white privilege who disproportionately target young blacks on the presumption of guilt. It is not a surprise, then, that the voiceless resort to anarchy to be heard.And still at every juncture, modest attempts at societal transformation are typically met with stiff white resistance and rancorous political partisanship.

Not since the early years of the HIV epidemic has there been so much constructive dialogue, progress, and involvement by the public. Long-term survivors, HIV organizations, scientists, public-health experts, and the generation that never knew a world without HIV joined hands on the 26th World AIDS Day in an effort to educate and advocate in commemoration of those we have lost to HIV and the people living with the infection today.While a few still wage a lonely and wasteful fight against science and progress itself, it is time to acknowledge that we finally have the opportunity to move on from a monotonous, one-way conversation and use these new tools as catalysts for serious and much-needed change.Of course, it doesn't help when one of our favorite Star Trek actors throws all logic overboard and simply dismisses today's generation as lazy, complacent and irresponsible, but it certainly shows that we haven't progressed much since President Reagan's infamous call to abstinence 27 years ago.Six of the estimated 39 million people we lost worldwide to HIV were my friends and mentors. All six would have agreed with Meryl Streep's Margaret Thatcher when she says in The Iron Lady, [I]f something's wrong, they shouldn't just whine about it. They should get in there and do something about it. Change things.""In the 1980s we did just that, and today's generation follows suit. We too get in there, do something, and change things. My next two weeks, for example, are tightly scheduled, with 10 PrEP panels across the U.S. Yesterday I was in Palm Springs and Los Angeles, today I am in New York City at Columbia University, on Dec. 4 I will be in Cleveland, on Dec. 6 I will be in Grand Rapids, on Dec. 7 I will be in Lansing, on Dec. 8 I will be in Detroit, on Dec. 10 I will be in St. Louis, on Dec. 11 I will be in Atlanta, and on Dec. 12 I will be in San Francisco.Here are five key focus points that I believe we must act on:Sexual-Health Education and Health Programs in SchoolsSexual-health education, especially in the U.S., is a mess. In a country where religious morals often dictate the code of conduct, preparing the next generation for when they first turn wet dreams into reality becomes challenging. This difficulty manifests itself in the U.S.'s shocking teenage-pregnancy rates, which surpass those of other Western countries by 20 points, and the rising rates of new HIV infections in young people. What we need is a federal minimum requirement for sexual-health curricula that includes a judgment-free approach to LGBTQ rights, issues, and history, as well as a public youth-health program to provide vaccinations, health screenings, and counseling to all adolescents free of charge.Decriminalization of HIVExposing someone to HIV with or without a condom is a crime in many places, often regardless of whether an actual transmission occurred. While this may seem well-intended on first glance, these laws heavily discriminate against people living with HIV and automatically make them culprits. Regardless of HIV status, the stigma around HIV has impacted us all culturally and emotionally. Decriminalizing HIV means alleviating that stigma, empowering, and educating.Reclassification of HIV as a Chronic InfectionThanks to the great strides we have made when it comes to the treatment of HIV, an infection with the virus no longer automatically equals an inevitable progression into the terminal illness known as AIDS.Diabetes, for example, is classified as a chronic illness. Reclassifying HIV as a chronic infection instead of as a terminal illness would lead to easier access to medication, care, and services, which in turn would lead to higher rates of viral suppression and thus reduce the number of new HIV infections. Updating of Testing GuidelinesOur prevention toolbox primarily consists of condoms, PrEP, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), TasP and testing. However, how well testing can reduce transmission risks depends on what test is being used and at what frequency. After exposure, it takes about 10 days for the virus to replicate itself enough within the body to be infectious. This is known as the ""eclipse period."" The following 90 days, the ""acute infection period,"" are the most infectious. Currently the CDC recommends annual testing and notes that there could be some benefit from more frequent testing. The best tests we have available today are HIV RNA tests that detect the virus seven to 10 days after exposure, and fourth-generation antibody or p24 antigen tests that detect the virus about 17 days after exposure. The time from exposure to detection is called the ""window period."" In comparison with these newer tests, the first and second generations of HIV antibody tests generally have a window period of about five to 12 weeks. Testing can be costly, though, and as first- and second-generation HIV antibody tests are still FDA-approved in the U.S., they remain the most commonly used. Updated testing guidelines should recommend that sexually active people get quarterly health screenings for all STIs, and that older tests be removed in order to shorten the possible transmission cycle of acute infections.Access and Health InsuranceThe Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act was undeniably one of the most important steps to reduce the number of new infections, by enabling people in heavily affected populations to access care. Sadly, 10 states that report some of the highest HIV-infection rates are among the 19 states that are not expanding Medicaid. Making health insurance accessible and understandable should be a key focus. Employees should be health-insured from the first day on the job. The current 90-day insurance gap is a vital threat to drug adherence, continuous care, and continuous prevention. HIV medications that are currently classified as ""specialty drugs"" should be considered maintenance drugs and be placed in lower copay tiers. Truvada and drugs that may be approved in the future for use as PrEP should be considered preventative medications, because that's really what they are in this case. This would greatly decrease access disparities and increase awareness, especially on the side of the PCPs.Drug formularies need to be easier to understand. For many people in the U.S., this is a completely new concept, and they are overwhelmed by information that is unnecessarily complicated. California Senate Bill 1052 is focused around this issue and was just signed into law in September 2014."

Protesters in the Indian city of Bhopal burned effigies representing Dow Chemicals and displayed placards demanding justice as they marked the 30th anniversary December 2 of the world's deadliest industrial disaster. Some held old black and white photographs of loved ones lost on the night of December 2, 1984, when a cloud of highly toxic methyl isocyanate gas spewed from a Union Carbide factory in Bhopal and blew across the city. AFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc141c92400005500e48057.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are certain moments in your life you never forget. I was in my early twenties, living in Bangalore, when I heard the news.On the night of December 2, 1984, toxic gas had leaked from a factory run by Union Carbide India Ltd spreading fumes over a large residential area in Bhopal.Bangalore is a long way from Bhopal but the images were so shocking and gruesome, it felt like next door.Between 7,000 and 10,000 people died within just three days of the leak, our researchers at Amnesty International have since estimated. Hundreds of thousands more were poisoned. Despite the deaths, the many years gone by, and the numbers of people who today still suffer from chronic health conditions as a result of the leak; justice is yet to be served. Today marks the 30th anniversary of one of the world's worst industrial disasters.Those who survived have faced a three-decade-long marathon campaign having to fight every step of the way for the few reparations that have been offered; the most basic medical treatment, insufficient clean water and so little financial compensation it is insulting. Sadly, several of those who have fought so hard for so long are aware they may now die without ever seeing justice. But the fight is being picked up by new generations -- their children, and their children's children -- who have been born with illnesses and exposed to on-going contamination from the abandoned factory site. As generations of survivors continue their fight for accountability, they have had to battle corporate spin to prove this was not a tragic accident but a disaster that could have been avoided. Union Carbide failed to take critical safety measures at the Bhopal factory, and in 1989 negotiated an out-of-court settlement with the Indian Government to pay compensation that was just 14% of what was asked for. It paid just U.S. $470 million for the deaths of thousands and the damage inflicted on hundreds of thousands in Bhopal. Averaging less than a thousand dollars per person affected this was a woefully inadequate amount which, I think, exposes a shocking level of indifference and contempt towards the victims in India.This settlement secured such egregious terms in Union Carbide's favour -- in return for a paltry financial settlement -- that the Indian Supreme Court later overturned the corporation's immunity from criminal prosecution. Then Union Carbide simply walked away, leaving the ticking time bomb that was the polluted factory site behind them, poisoning drinking water for many miles around. Thirty years on, those who failed to prevent the horror of Bhopal must be held to account. But the central actor, a U.S. corporation, is an absconder from justice. Facing charges of culpable homicide in India, Union Carbide Corporation -- the majority-owners of Union Carbide India Ltd at the time of the leak, and now a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company -- has found a safe haven in the U.S., where it has been able to ignore all court orders from India. In an effort to move the criminal trial forward, the Bhopal criminal court has summoned Dow to appear and explain why it has not ordered its wholly owned subsidiary to appear before the courts. Dow, displaying the same arrogant contempt for the Indian judicial system as Union Carbide, has not bothered to show up. The people of the U.S. and their political representatives would never accept the situation if the tables were turned. Had oil giant BP tried to hide out behind the skirts of UK jurisdiction after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, it is inconceivable that the U.S. -- or the UK, for that matter -- would have tolerated it.In 2010, finally, seven former employees of Union Carbide India Ltd were found guilty of causing death by negligence; but while the Indian employees have been convicted, the foreign accused -- Union Carbide Corporation and its former CEO -- were able to evade justice simply by remaining abroad. Both the U.S. and the Indian authorities have failed the people of Bhopal for too long. Successive Indian governments have failed to vigorously pursue justice in relation to the foreign corporation or clean up the site.They have often appeared unmoved by the courageous -- and heroically patient -- fight for justice of the survivors.President Obama should urgently compel Union Carbide to appear in the Indian court; and Prime Minister Modi should vigorously pursue a full and fair compensation settlement for every victim.In September Modi and Obama made a joint statement saying the ties between the U.S. and India are rooted in their shared desire for justice and equality. It is neither justice nor equality when a U.S. company can evade accountability for the deaths of thousands of people in India. "

I was interested in architecture and design, and slowly, but surely, realized I became a curator because it was another way to communicate the belief that design is important and endlessly inspiring.I studied architecture, and when you study the subject in Italy, you also study design; they come together. Then, I started as a gofer on exhibitions in Milan. Slowly but surely, I became an assistant curator. At the same time I was also a journalist of architecture and design, and later on I started teaching. If you think about it, all these different platforms - the school, the magazine, the newspaper, the website and the exhibition, are all ways to communicate. But it's only today, now that the word ""curator"" has become so used, overused, and abused, that I realize that it all comes together, describing a need to communicate.I also run a department of R&D for MoMA. Among other activities, we organize salons that happen loosely every other month. The first salon was indeed about curation. I moderated a panel with Maria Popova, an outstanding curator and writer; Ann Temkin, the Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA; Jeff Jarvis, journalist and professor at CUNY (and the first to argue that some journalists' job is to curate sources for the public); Tor Hermansen, music writer and producer of big hits for, among others, Rihanna, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé.We came to several interesting conclusions. One of the most revealing is that curators need an audience. It doesn't matter if big or small. Depending on the curator, it can be of different size and scope. It can be specialized or generic. But curation is really about communicating. That's a meaningful realization.One of the best metaphors for what I do - beside ""hunter/gatherer,"" which is a vivid depiction - is being a reporter. I really revere journalism and journalists - good journalists - and I also believe that there's nothing ever objective about reporting. Simply by highlighting a word before another, one can give a slant to the whole article.The same happens with curating contemporary design. In some exhibitions, of course, the interpretation is much more personal; in other cases, it might seem like it is just objective reporting. But it never is. There's always an agenda [about celebrating design or communicating a message]. That is my mission, and it is very publicly disclosed. It's not a hidden agenda.Paola Antonelli is the Senior Curator of Architecture & Design and the Director of R&D at MoMA.Installation view of the exhibition, ""A Collection of Ideas.""

20,GREEN,Inhofe's Grand Climate Conspiracy Theory: It's All About Barbra Streisand,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/inhofe-barbra-streisand_n_6261874.html,,2014-12-03,"UNITED STATES - July 25 : Chairman Carl Levin, D-MI., and Ranking Member James Inhofe, R-OK., during the Senate Armed Services full committee hearing on defense department nominations on July 25, 2013. (Photo By Douglas Graham/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb161f4200000e800ffa0d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story was originally published by Mother Jones and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.The recent news on the front page of the New York Times was stark. As thousands of diplomats were gathering in Lima, Peru, to work on an agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions, scientists and climate policy experts were warningthat it now may be impossible to prevent the temperature of the planet's atmosphere from rising by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. According to a large body of scientific research, that is the tipping point at which the world will be locked into a near-term future of drought, food and water shortages, melting ice sheets, shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels and widespread flooding—events that could harm the world's population and economy.But with an effort under way in Lima to protect the difference, as the newspaper put it, ""between a newly unpleasant world and an uninhabitable one,"" one fellow in Washington is readying himself to prevent any progress toward a climate accord: Sen. James Inhofe. The 80-year-old Republican from Oklahoma is one of the most notorious deniers of human-induced climate change. He has contended that God controls the Earth's climate, not Homo sapiens, and he has quoted the Bible to make this point: ""As long as the Earth remains there will be seed time and harvest, cold and heat, winter and summer, day and night."" And Inhofe, thanks to the recent elections, is in line to chair the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee when the Republicans assume control of the Senate next month. He has vowed to do all he can to block regulations aimed at cutting emissions.With diplomats in Lima wrestling with the challenges of climate negotiations and Inhofe counting the days until his likely ascension to one of the most powerful environment-related positions on the planet, I'm reminded of a bizarre encounter I had with the senator at a previous climate summit.In December 2009, the United Nations hosted a global gathering in Copenhagen to hammer out what some participants hoped would be a binding accord that would compel a reduction in emissions around the world. Thousands of diplomats, policy advocates, and scientists flocked to the Danish city for the session, and thousands of reporters were there to chronicle the talks. Inhofe came too. To troll. Or, as he put it, to be ""a one-man truth squad."" He slithered in and out of the cavernous media filing center, ever at the ready to speak to reporters looking for the other side quotes denigrating the proceedings, claiming that climate change was no more than a hoax, and celebrating the summit's failure to produce a binding and comprehensive treaty.Inhofe was usually mobbed by reporters—especially non-American journalists who found it newsworthy that a US senator would say such things. Judging from the smile on his mug, Inhofe enjoyed skunking up the party. After watching this for a few days, I could not resist the urge to engage.As he strolled through the media center one afternoon, accompanied by several camera crews recording his pronouncements, I approached and politely asked if I could put a question to him. Sure, he said, in his folksy, avuncular manner.Look around us, I said, spreading my arms wide. There are thousands of intelligent and well-meaning people in this gigantic conference center: scientists, heads of state, government officials, policy experts. They believe that climate change is a serious and pressing threat and that something must be done soon. Do you believe that they have all been fooled?Yes, he said, grinning.That these people who have traveled from all points of the globe to be here are victims of a well-orchestrated hoax?Yes, he said, still smiling.That's some hoax, I countered. But who has engineered such a scam?Hollywood liberals and extreme environmentalists, Inhofe replied.Really? I asked. Why would they conspire to scare all these smart people into believing a catastrophe was under way, when all was well?Inhofe didn't skip a beat: To advance their radical environmental agenda.I pressed on: Who in Hollywood is doing this?The whole liberal crowd, Inhofe said.But who?Barbra Streisand, he responded.I nearly laughed. All these people had assembled in Copenhagen because of Barbra Streisand. A singer and actor had perpetuated the grandest con of the past 100 years?That's right, Inhofe said, with a straight face. And others, he added.By this point, he was losing patience and glancing about for another reporter who wanted to record his important observations. And I was running out of follow-up queries. After all, was I really going to ask, ""And Ed Begley Jr. too?"" So our conversation ended, and I headed back to reality.But I was struck by this thought: Did this senator truly believe Barbra Streisand was the devious force behind a completely phony global campaign to address climate change? He seemed to.In his 2012 book, The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future, Inhofe does mention Streisand—but only once, lumping her together with Leonardo DiCaprio and John Travolta as celebs whose environmental ""alarmism"" had to be debunked. But his book did not shy away from clearly identifying the charlatans and hoaxers who have hornswoggled the planet: ""environmental activist extremists,"" Al Gore, MoveOn.org, George Soros, Michael Moore, and, yes, ""the Hollywood elites.""Perhaps when Inhofe seizes the reins of the Senate environment committee, he can further expose this conspiracy—and for the first witness…Barbra Streisand. It's time for her to come clean.UPDATE: After this story was published, Streisand issued the following statement: ""This would be hilarious if it weren't so frightening. I thank Senator Inhofe for singling me out as a voice against the perils of climate change! But I'm just a small part of millions of voices, who are informed and alarmed, including 97% of all climate scientists! God help us! This man is going to head the Committee on the Environment in the United States Senate. It’s like giving a fox the keys to the chicken coop."""

James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) told him several years ago that Barbra Streisand was behind a vast conspiracy to fool us into believing that climate change is real. At first, Inhofe's claim seems ridiculous, even alarming. The senator may chair the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee when the Republicans take control of the Senate, for goodness' sake! However, upon reflection, Inhofe's conspiracy theory is not as preposterous as it appears.It would take a creative genius to execute a hoax on such a grand scale. Barbra Streisand is a talented individual and has proven herself to be a consummate artist of stage, screen and music. She is also a known perfectionist who works tirelessly on every creative element in her work. Who else but the creative and thorough Streisand would be able to cover every conceivable detail in order to trick so many people so convincingly in so many ways?Her motivation? Barbra Streisand is 72 years old. By anyone's standards, the woman looks terrific for her age. Whenever I see her singing or answering questions in an interview, I think, ""Wow, she looks amazing! I hope I age as gracefully!"" However, Sen. Inhofe's theory has made me realize that, in fact, Ms. Streisand is just as average-looking as the rest of us. She is bamboozling us into thinking climate change is genuine in order for her much more elaborate plan to work: She wants to make us believe that she looks younger and prettier than she is in reality.It is all about the lighting. When Barbra Streisand directs a film, she carefully lights a scene with a gorgeous glow. She films herself in the most flattering light possible. Take The Mirror Has Two Faces, for example. The moment a scene turns romantic, Barbra is bathed in a fantastic, warm, perfectly hued light. When Jeff Bridges looks adoringly at her nerdy, college-professor character, Barbra looks wildly glamorous and dewy. It appears effortless, but achieving this lighting technique is an art form. Who else would be concerned about climate change but someone obsessed with lighting? If the Earth's climate heated up, the sun's rays would be harsher. The effect would be harmful to our perception of an individual's beauty. Barbra Streisand is tricking us into believing that she looks dazzling in unflattering, climate-changed lighting when, in fact, she is standing in the original, flattering sun. Why doesn't she simply get plastic surgery to look younger, like everyone else in Hollywood? She does not want to take the chance of a nose job ruining the sound of her singing voice. So she must fool us all into thinking there is climate change in order to keep us believing that she looks ravishing naturally.The woman is a mastermind. In addition to this complicated scheme of hers, she holds a certain power that she could unleash at any time. Barbra Streisand has a huge gay fan base. If she wanted, she could get those gay fans to do just about anything. If she said the word, she could get vast amounts of gays to sin like crazy to anger God enough to cause actual climate change in the forms of hurricanes, tornadoes, etc. (Disclaimer: I am one of those gay Streisand fans, so I can attest -- I would willingly sin if she encouraged it!) Sen. Inhofe is educated in the Bible and has used scripture when discussing climate. He must be aware of impending danger if Streisand does not get her way. There is untapped, lustful, immoral homosexuality that she could compel into action. He has not gone too public with his theories about her deceitful plans, in fear of the harm she might inflict. She is friends with the Clintons, so who knows what other crazy, liberal designs she has planned to hoodwink America?!Some may say that Sen. Inhofe is envious. He is 80 years old and does not look nearly as good as Ms. Streisand. She may be crafty, but he has smarts. He has waited patiently for years to get where he is. Now that he is so close to having Senate power over environmental issues, Barbra better watch out!I am gay, so I was required to worship La Streisand when I signed up for my Gay Card. But now that Sen. Inhofe has opened my eyes to her devilry, I am disappointed in my diva. I feel safer knowing that the senator may take over the Environment and Public Works Committee. You never know what Liza Minnelli might have up her sleeve, but I am sure that our eagle-eyed senator will expose any more trickery, and I, for one, will sleep better at night."

Demand for high-speed Internet in the Arctic is expected to grow as shipping, fishing and oil companies move north amid warming temperatures and melting ice.(AP Photo/Brennan Linsley, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb161f31f00002e0123441f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story originally appeared on Ensia.In the winter of 2013–14, hundreds of milk-white birds with luminous yellow eyes and wingspans of up to 5 feet descended on beaches, farmers’ fields, city parks and airport runways throughout southern Canada and the United States.Traditionally, snowy owls spend most of their time in the Arctic and subarctic regions. But every four years or so when populations of lemmings — among the owl’s favorite foods — cycle downward, a small number of young, inexperienced birds that are less adept than their elders at hunting will fly farther south than they might normally rather than starve to death. No one, however, had seen an irruption as big and as far-reaching as this one, which was the second major such event in North America in three years.By the first week of December, the big birds were spotted from North Dakota to Maine and from Newfoundland to Bermuda. At one point, owls collided with five planes at Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports.Snowy owl irruptions are not in themselves a sure sign that something extraordinary is happening in an Arctic world that is warming nearly twice as fast as the global rate. But given the rapid-fire fashion in which similar, unexpected events have been unfolding throughout the circumpolar region, it’s clear that the Arctic we know is coming to an end, and that a new and very different Arctic is taking over.What happens in the Arctic matters. The ecological, cultural and economic shifts that are currently underway will not only alter the lives of the Inuit, Gwich’in, Nenets and other aboriginal people who live there, they are likely to affect mid-latitude weather patterns, the migrating birds we see, the air we breathe, the fuel we burn and the way in which we transport goods from one continent to another. The question then becomes, how do we understand and manage the end of the Arctic as we know it so we are prepared to deal with the new Arctic that is unfolding?A Picture of ChangeThe past 10 years paint a dramatic picture of climate-related changes at the top of the world. First there were massive forest fires that torched a record 4.2 million hectares of trees in the Yukon and Alaska in 2004. Smoke from those fires could be detected all the way to the east coast of Canada and throughout many parts of the contiguous United States. Parts of the Alaska Highway were shut down for days at a time. Alaskans suffered for 15 days when air quality in cities such as Fairbanks was deemed to be hazardous to health by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards.Then it was the collapse of the 9-mile-long, 3-mile-wide, 120-foot-thick Ayles Ice Shelf off the north coast of Ellesmere Island in 2005. Scientist Warwick Vincent likened the collapse, the largest recorded in the Canadian Arctic, to a cruise missile hitting the shelf after it registered as a small earthquake at a seismic station 150 miles away.Grizzly and polar bear hybrids like this one are icons of the changes taking place as traditional Arctic habitat disappears. Photo by Jodie Pongracz, Government of the Northwest Territories.In 2006 we learned of the world’s first wild polar bear–grizzly bear hybrid, of further increases in relatively warm Pacific water flowing north through the Bering Strait, of gray whales overwintering in the Beaufort Sea instead of migrating to the California coast and — from the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center — news that September sea ice was declining 8.6 percent per decade or 23,328 square miles per year. At the time, some scientists scoffed when NSIDC research scientist Julienne Stroeve predicted that the Arctic Ocean would have no ice in September by 2060. But when Arctic sea ice retreated to another record low a year later, many suggested September ice might be gone by 2040.Then came 2007 — the year in which it became crystal clear that winter’s freeze was losing its ability to keep up with summer’s melt. A rare, extraordinarily large tundra fire on the north slope of Alaska accounted for 40 percent of the area burned in the state that summer. Avian cholera, a disease that is common in the south but largely absent in the eastern Arctic, killed nearly one-third of the nesting female common eiders at East Bay, home to the largest colony of the species in the region. It was so warm that summer that the Inuit of Grise Fiord, the most northerly civilian community on the continent, were forced to stockpile sea ice for drinking water because runoff from a nearby glacier dried up.For the third year in a row, hundreds of beluga whales and narwhal made the mistake of staying in the Canadian Arctic longer than they should have because there was still much open water when summer came to an end. In Lancaster Sound alone, Inuit hunters shot more than 600 belugas that would have otherwise drowned as the small pools of open water they were trapped in shrank to nothing over a 10-day period.But what really made the big melt of 2007 an eye-popping one was the absence of ice in areas where it almost never thaws. The so-called “mortuary” of old ice that perennially chokes M’Clintock Channel in the High Arctic of Canada virtually disappeared that August. The “birthplace” of a great deal of new ice that is manufactured in Viscount Melville Sound to the north was down to half of its normal ice cover. “The ice is no longer growing or getting old,” said John Falkingham, chief forecaster for the Canadian Ice Service.Massive chunks of ice broke from the warming Petermann Glacier in Greenland in the summer of 2012.Extraordinary as the events of 2007 were, the changes that have been brought on by a rapidly warming Arctic have not let up since then. In 2010 and 2012, 100 square miles and 46 square miles respectively broke away from the Petermann Glacier in Greenland. The presence of so much warm open water in 2012 — when another record low for sea ice cover was established — fueled an unusually powerful summer cyclone that tore through the Arctic for nearly two weeks.It wasn’t just sea ice that was being churned up and melted more quickly by these increasingly powerful storms. In the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta in Alaska, which is already vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges sent waves of saltwater more than 30 kilometers inland on three occasions between 2005 and 2011. This doesn’t bode well for the million birds that nest in the delta nor for the Chinook (king) salmon, which have been in steep decline in the region for more than a decade. This year’s run of between 71,000 and 117,000 was expected to be as poor as last year’s, which established a record low.In an ominous positive feedback loop, a recently discovered crater in the thawing Siberian permafrost is spewing methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. Photo by Marya Zulinova, press service of the Governor YaNAO.Even among all this, one of the most recent signs of change has been especially alarming. All across the Arctic, scientists have been detecting abnormally high concentrations of methane seeping out of the thawing permafrost. In one spectacular example discovered along Siberia’s Yamal Peninsula in 2014, concentrations of the greenhouse gas 50,000 times higher than the atmospheric average were found to be rising from a 200 feet deep crater that was formed when a massive sheet of permafrost thawed and collapsed. In another case in Canada’s western Arctic, three of many seeps found in the area were found to be emitting as much greenhouse gases in a year as are emitted by 9,000 average-sized cars.Unable to find sufficient sea ice to lie on, thousands of walrus took to the shores of the Chukchi Sea in September 2014. Photo by Corey Accardo, AP/NOAA.We are already seeing the effects of some of these changes ripple through various ecosystems. Capelin, not arctic cod, is now the dominant fish in Hudson Bay. Killer whales, once stopped by sea ice, are now preying on narwhals and beluga whales throughout the Arctic Ocean. Pacific salmon of all types are moving into many parts of the Canadian Arctic where they have never been seen before. Polar bears at the southern end of their range are getting thinner and producing fewer cubs than they have in the past. Chukchi Sea walrus are hauling out on land by the tens of thousands, as 35,000 of them did in September 2014 when there was no more sea ice to use as platforms.The changes that are occurring are circumpolar. In the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, fjords on the west coast have not been frozen for several years. Tundra there is being overtaken by shrubs, just as it is in Siberia, Chukotka, Arctic Canada and the north slope of Alaska where barren ground caribou — fixtures on the summer tundra — are dramatically declining. According to the CircumArctic Rangifer Monitoring and Assessment Network, which is run on a voluntary basis by veteran biologists Don Russell, Anne Gunn and others, half of the world’s 23 barren ground caribou herds that are routinely counted are in decline. Only three, maybe four, are increasing, and they are doing so only modestly. Measured another way by biologists Liv Vors and Mark Boyce, who included the fate of boreal forest and mountain caribou in their survey, 34 of the 43 major herds scientists have studied worldwide in the past decade are in a free-fall.Flash ForwardIf the past tells us anything about the future, it’s that there will be many more changes that were not anticipated. A few things, however, we know with some degree of confidence.First, temperatures will continue to rise, resulting in the Arctic Ocean being seasonally ice-free by 2040 or possibly earlier. Two-thirds of the world’s polar bears will be gone a decade later, as will one-third of the 45,000 lakes in the Mackenzie, one of the largest deltas in the Arctic.In 2100, when trees and shrubs overtake much of the grasses and sedges on the tundra, what we think of as traditional habitat for barren ground caribou will have shrunk by as much as 89 percent. Coniferous forests will be replaced by deciduous ones in many places. Some trees will have begun to take root on the south end of the Arctic Archipelago. Most of the polar ice caps on Melville Island will have melted away.And summer storms in the Arctic will continue to pick up steam as melting ice and warming waters contribute to further rises in sea levels. The pounding these storms inflict on frozen shorelines will accelerate the thawing of permafrost which currently traps massive amounts of methane. The Arctic Ocean will continue to acidify as its upper surface absorbs the carbon dioxide that continues to be emitted from both the ground and from the burning of fossil fuels.The future is not necessarily all doom and gloom, however. There is compelling evidence to suggest that some subarctic and Arctic animals — such as the bowhead whale, the musk ox and the barren ground grizzly bear — will likely thrive in this warmer world. So, too, may the wood bison, which emerged from the 19th century greatly diminished in the subarctic due to habitat loss and overhunting before animals were reintroduced to parts of the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, Siberia and Alaska. There are even signs that cougars could stage a comeback in a land in which the maneless Beringian lion once preyed on animals such as the saiga antelope.Still, as daunting as the future Arctic looks to be, it may in fact be much worse. What we think we know about the future of the region may be grossly underestimated because scientists are uncomfortable talking about or putting pen to predictions that are not backed by 95 percent certainty.Benjamin Abbott and University of Florida researcher Edward Schuur anonymously surveyed climate and fire experts in 2013, asking them how much boreal forest and tundra will burn in the future. Nearly all respondents painted a picture that is much worse than what most experts had publicly claimed. In a “business-as-usual” scenario, they predicted that emissions from boreal forest fires will increase 16 to 90 percent by 2040. Emissions from tundra fires will grow even more rapidly.As much as we know and think we know about what the future Arctic might look like, it’s what we don’t know that worries scientists like Henry Huntington, co-chair of the National Research Council committee that recently examined emerging research questions in the Arctic. “Many of the questions we’ve been asking are ones we’ve been asking for some time,” says Huntington. “But more and more, there are new questions arising from insights that have been made only in recent years, or phenomena that have only begun to occur.”Growing Wealth, Shrinking CooperationAll together, the changes past and present in the Arctic paint a picture of a future unfolding with potentially large economic and geopolitical ramifications.As shipping lanes open in the Arctic, cargo ships will become more common sights.Receding sea ice, for example, is revealing 22 percent of the undiscovered, technically recoverable hydrocarbon resources in the world, as well as the potential for a commercial fishing industry. It is opening up shipping lanes that are far shorter and economical than existing routes that must pass through the Panama and Suez canals.This will prove to be challenging. Most of the Arctic currently belongs to the five coastal Arctic states — the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway and Denmark Greenland. But a big part of it — the so-called 1.2 million-square-mile “donut hole” in the central Arctic Ocean — does not fall under any country’s jurisdiction.Receding sea ice is opening new channels for commercial fishing in the Arctic.Until recently, security issues, search and rescue protocols, indigenous rights, climate change, and other environmental priorities were the main concerns of the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum that includes the eight voting states bordering the Arctic and several indigenous organizations that have participant status. But the recent admission of China and other major Asian economic powers as observer states is yet another strong sign that the economic development of an increasingly ice-free Arctic is becoming a top priority of nations in the region and beyond.As this interest in the Arctic’s future wealth grows, willingness to cooperate and compromise may shrink.The United States, for example, continues to challenge Canada’s claim that the Northwest Passage is part of its inland waters and not an international strait. Nor does the United States recognize Canada’s claim to a small resource-rich region in the Beaufort Sea. In the meantime, Canada and Denmark have agreed to disagree over the ownership of Hans Island in the eastern Arctic as they continue to work out a tentative agreement on the maritime boundary in the Lincoln Sea. And Russia continues to flex its military might in the Arctic in a way that has NATO allies concerned.On the positive side, the current process of dividing up the unclaimed territory in the Arctic may well be resolved by protocols set forth by the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. The five coastal Arctic states have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars mapping the Arctic Ocean floor to make a case for extending their territories northward. But the recommendations that will eventually be put forth are likely to come in the distant future and they are not legally binding.Alternatively, there may be some hope, because headway has been made in the development of an international fisheries agreement that would protect the waters of the central Arctic Ocean.The dark horse in all this is China, which as an exporting nation and major energy consumer stands to gain from shorter trade routes through the Arctic and from the energy resources there that remain largely unexploited. It may or may or may not play along with the Arctic Council’s current efforts to focus on sustainable economic development and environmental protection in the Arctic. A Canadian think-tank — the Macdonald-Laurier Institute — recently suggested that China’s true intentions in the Arctic may amount to “positioning itself to influence heavily, if not outright control, the awarding of select Arctic energy and fishing-related concessions as well as the rules and political arrangements governing the use of strategic waterways now gradually opening due to melting ice.”Now What?With all of this in mind, what should be done?One clear course of action is to halt the activity giving rise to the change — fossil fuel consumption and the release of methane gas as permafrost thaws and sea ice melts. Given the pace of change and the long lag time, however, there is very little that can be done to stop the Arctic from warming in the short term. Humans have already released so much greenhouse gas that even if we stop right now, it will take centuries to halt or reverse the decline of sea ice cover, the thawing of permafrost, the meltdown of glaciers and the acidification of the Arctic Ocean, which is directly attributable to the increase in emissions.Receding sea ice in the Arctic is revealing 22 percent of the undiscovered, technically recoverable hydrocarbon resources in the world. But offshore oil and gas development brings with it environmental risks. (AFP Photo/Greenpeace/Tim Aubry).New economic opportunities may arise from oil and gas developments and commercial shipping, but those economic benefits could be offset by a blowout or shipping accident that could prove to be even more catastrophic than the Exxon Valdez disaster and BP’s Deep Water Horizon. Unlike Prince William Sound or the Gulf of Mexico, there is ice in the Arctic and no ports and few runways from which to stage a cleanup. There is also no practical way of separating oil from ice. There is, therefore, a need to develop technologies to increase safety of oil and gas extraction before exploration and extraction proceeds. There is also a need to identify and protect biological hot spots that are vulnerable to this kind of human activity.One of the biggest challenges in planning for the future is to figure out what the new Arctic (including the sub-Arctic) might look like. Against a backdrop of boreal forest, tundra, permafrost, polar deserts, glaciers, ice caps, mountains, rivers, deltas, sea ice, polynyas, gyres and open ocean, that won’t be easy to do. There are thousands of pieces to this puzzle. They include the 21,000 cold-climate mammals, birds, fish, invertebrates, plants and fungi we know a lot about. They also include countless microbes and endoparasites that remain largely a mystery. Further discoveries of microscopic creatures new to science, such as the picobiliphytes found in the Arctic in 2006, are inevitable.A rigorous assessment of what the future might look like could help decision makers understand who the winners and losers will be in a future Arctic and what other surprises we can expect. This will help identify which low-lying Arctic communities need to be shored up, moved or made fire safe. It could guide decision-makers in designing better rules and regulations for pipelines and resource development and for commercial shipping. It could also help decision-makers better understand, predict, mitigate and adapt to both changes in the Arctic itself and trickle-down effects to temperate regions.This is already being done with some success on a small scale. A program in Old Crow, the most northerly community in the Yukon, for example, successfully paired scientists with community leaders to address the issue of food security in a quickly changing climate. Similarly, in Alaska, the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives have facilitated partnerships between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other federal agencies, states, tribes, non-governmental organizations, universities and stakeholders within a number of ecologically defined areas.What the Arctic really needs, in addition to these and other small-scale initiatives, is international cooperation either through an overarching treaty or through a series of binding agreements. The issues are too big, too complex and in many cases too overlapping to be left to individual countries to address. In order for this to happen the role of the Arctic Council needs to be strengthened. Science needs to be funded much better than it has been, the indigenous people of the Arctic must be equal partners in the decision-making process, and non-Arctic countries such as China must be included in the conversation.The future of the Arctic is not necessarily completely bleak. But if we continue to ignore or underestimate the changes that are taking place in this part of the world, it will, as climatologist Mark Serreze bluntly said in 2009, “bite us [and] bite hard.”     "
