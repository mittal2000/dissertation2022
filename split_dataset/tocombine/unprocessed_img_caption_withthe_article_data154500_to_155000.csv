West's sixth studio album will be released June 18 (as previously hinted in West's tweet) and be titled ""Yeezus.""Rap-Up confirmed the news on Saturday. West is due to perform two songs on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and sources tell The Huffington Post that he'll debut a previously unheard song as part of the show.This isn't the first time ""Yeezus"" has been tossed around. Kid Cudi (formerly signed to Kanye's G.O.O.D. Music label) coined the term well over a year ago (a tip of the hat to Complex for the find). West also famously posed for a Rolling Stone cover wearing a crown of thorns."

(Photo By: Richard Corkery/NY Daily News via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb428d5220000ba01dc0804.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When this year's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony airs on HBO Saturday night, Rush, Heart, Public Enemy, Donna Summer and Randy Newman, among others, will be seen joining those already enshrined in the Cleveland museum. But one group that won't be represented, yet again, is the self-proclaimed ""hottest band in the world,"" KISS.Longtime fans can't believe the group that taught America how to rock and roll all night and party every day still hasn't made the cut. The Huffington Post asked lead singer Paul Stanley if there's hope of a reprieve.""Well, it depends on who lives longer, us or Jann Wenner,"" Stanley said, referring to the Rolling Stone editor-in-chief who co-founded the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame back in the mid-1980s. Fans have a tendency to blame Wenner for the KISS snub. (One brave loyalist even confronted Wenner on the street to demand answers.) But the real obstacle may be journalist Dave Marsh, who plays a key role in the selection process and once told MTV, ""Kiss is not a great band, Kiss was never a great band, Kiss never will be a great band, and I have done my share to keep them off the ballot."" Stanley, who has been making the media rounds to publicize the opening of a new branch of his Rock & Brews restaurant chain, questioned the legitimacy of the hall itself. ""Look, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is marketing,"" he said. ""You've got a bunch of faceless people in a back room who trademark a name that sounds very official. Well, if you had thought of it first, you would have been the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.""Stanley, who turned 61 in January and has been playing with KISS for 40 years, also complained that artists who aren't generally considered rock 'n' rollers keep getting inducted, even as his group keeps getting overlooked. ""I am one of the biggest Laura Nyro fans. I still listen to that stuff incessantly. Laura Nyro does not belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Songwriter Hall of Fame? Absolutely,"" he said.Some rock purists dismiss KISS as a ""comic book rock band,"" to quote Steven Tyler, but their kid-friendly costumes and easy-to-learn riffs have arguably enhanced their influence over ensuing generations of musicians. Garth Brooks, Lenny Kravitz and Mike McCready of Pearl Jam have all expressed their indebtedness to the band. ""It's absurd for anybody to look around and hear the acts and artists who cite us as an inspiration, and then tell me that we're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"" Stanley said. Not that he cares! ""I'm not here to make converts, and I think that the people who choose not to see things, I'm not missing their adoration.""If anything, Stanley said, he'd like to see KISS recognized for the sake of the fans. ""I would certainly accept on their behalf because it seems to be a major sore spot for them,"" he said. ""But I don't need the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.""The third Rock & Brews restaurant opened on the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles on May 8. According to a press release, Stanley and KISS co-founder Gene Simmons, who are partners in the franchise, plan to open ""as many as 100 Rock & Brews restaurants over the next five years.""""I'm a real foodie,"" said Stanley, adding that he admires the chefs Thomas Keller and Julian Serrano. (KISS has deep roots in Brooklyn, but Stanley, who grew up in New York, admitted he hasn't yet sampled the borough's now-celebrated fare.) It's tempting to assume that Stanley handles the food and Simmons, who once vied for the approval of Donald Trump on ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" is the marketing whiz, but Stanley said that's not the case. ""I would say if somebody said to the two of us, 'You guys should make a cake,' Gene would tell me that it's gotta be six feet tall and what color it should be, and I'd say, 'Yeah, but there's gotta be a cake underneath it.' But we work great together,"" Stanley said. ""Our track record together is far better than on our own.""The Rock & Brews restaurants promise to give rock fans a place to bring their kids and eat well. Asked if he and Simmons found the bring-the-whole-family angle awkward after four decades of selling themselves as skirt-chasing rock gods, Stanley said, ""I am a rock god still, but I think the biggest change is what goes on when I'm not on stage.""Today, Stanley lives in Los Angeles with his wife and their three youngest children. Their oldest, a son, studies music at New York University.""I look back with tremendous, tremendous fondness and great memories on a life of debauchery, but I sure as hell would find it sad to still be there,"" Stanley said. ""There's nothing more pathetic than seeing the guy in the club who you think is a little past being there."""

McDonald's, which virtually created the market for burgers and fries in the country and convinced Russians it's OK to eat with their hands, must fend off a growing challenge from rivals Burger King Worldwide Inc., Subway Restaurants, Yum! Brands Inc. and Wendy's Co. Photographer: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb13a173c000018010bc0b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"by Christina Bronsing and Anna LappéWho has freckles, pigtails, and is still holding out from joining the Fair Food Program? If you guessed the fresh-faced mascot of Wendy's, give yourself a gold star. As part of its efforts to improve conditions in the fields, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a group of farmworkers based in Florida, is calling on the fast food giant Wendy's to step up for farmworkers and their families.The Coalition has had an impressive wave of wins as many companies -- eleven to date -- have signed an agreement to improve conditions for farmworkers. Of the top five fast food chains, McDonald's, Burger King, Subway, and Yum! Brands (owners of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC and A&W) have all joined the Fair Food Program. In response to pressure from the Coalition and its allies, the list has grown to include Chipotle, food retailers (Whole Foods, Trader Joe's), and food service companies (BAMCO, Aramark, Sodexo and Compass Group). The overwhelming majority of tomato growers now participate in this farmworker-driven commitment through the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange, which represents 90 percent of the industry.By signing on to the agreement, companies must now comply with a code of conduct that includes protections for cases of wage theft, sexual harassment, and forced labor. Companies also agree to pay a small premium for tomatoes -- just a penny more per pound. As a result, workers have safer working conditions and have started seeing increases in their paychecks for the first time in more than 30 years.Think a penny a pound doesn't sound like much? It adds up. Over $10 million has been paid out through these victories since January 2011. That number will only keep growing as more companies sign on.Hey, Wendy's, are you listening? Wendy's, of all companies, can afford paying this premium. One of the highest earning fast food chains in the country, Wendy's comes in at number two behind McDonald's. Nearly 6,600 restaurants in the U.S. and around the globe afford the company serious market power-- influence that can go a long way to shift purchasing practices. Instead of leveraging that power to demand lower prices from suppliers, Wendy's could be rewarding growers who respect workers' rights.Other fast food companies have stepped up, like Taco Bell. The fast food giant was the first company to sign on to the Coalition agreement back in 2005, after four years of pressure and organizing. In its announcement, Taco Bell said:""As an industry leader, we are pleased to lend our support to and work with the CIW to improve working and pay conditions for farmworkers in the Florida tomato fields... We recognize there is a need for reform... We hope others in the restaurant industry and supermarket retail trade will follow our leadership."" - Emil Brolick, Taco Bell President (2005)Brolick and Taco Bell showed that signing on to the agreement wouldn't threaten a company's bottom line. In fact, Brolick's tenure is credited with boosting sales and 'turning things around at Taco Bell. Proof that profits don't come at the expense of workers' rights.Seven years later, Wendy's is still dragging its feet instead of following Taco Bell's example -- or more accurately Brolick's own example, since he has now taken over as CEO of Wendy's.This week, as Wendy's convenes its annual shareholders' meeting in New York City, the Coalition is in town to make sure the company has its priorities straight. On Saturday, May 18th, farmworkers and allies will march from Union Square to nearby Wendy's locations, reminding shareholders that farmworkers aren't an abstract budget line item, but hardworking women and men who deserve respect. (And, sure, to give Wendy's CEO Emil Brolick a dose of déjà vu. He already has some experience with this, after all.)If you're in or around New York, show your support: join the march from Union Square this Saturday at 2pm. And if you're miles from the action: raise your virtual voice and sign the e-petition! Join us in asking Wendy's to do the right thing: it's time to stand up and sign-on for a just and fair food system.  _____________________________________________________________Christina Bronsing is an activist and researcher supporting social movements that protect the rights of producers and farmers in the face of a largely industrial, corporate food system.
