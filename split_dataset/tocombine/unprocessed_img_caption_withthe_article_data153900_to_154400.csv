The initiative is part of the state's Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojna (MKY), a program launched in 2006 to help poor women marry. Under the MKY, the state pays for couples to participate in mass marriage ceremonies and awards them housewarming gifts worth 15,000 rupees ($270), according to Slate.The toilet requirement, which requires groom to prove that their homes contain a toilet in order to receive the MKY benefits, was added in 2011. More than 1,700 couples have married under the MKY this year, according to The Wall Street Journal. One hundred eighty-four couples participated in Monday's ceremony. In addition to hygienic concerns, MKY attempts to address the problem of women and girls being raped when they go out to relieve themselves in the open (especially in the early morning or late evening). The BBC reported earlier this month that 400 women would have ""escaped"" rape last year if they had a toilet in their home.Test your knowledge of marriage around the world with the quiz below.Keep in touch!

They are among 44 cases and 22 deaths worldwide, according to the WHO, which has called it the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).""Without that proper risk assessment, we cannot have clarity on the incubation period, on the signs and symptoms of the disease, on the proper clinical management and then, last but not least, on travel advice,"" Chan told the WHO's annual ministerial meeting in Geneva.The WHO, which sent a first team to Saudi Arabia this month, will provide a fresh risk assessment ahead of this year's haj, which takes place in October.""We need to get the facts clear and get the appropriate advice to all your countries where your pilgrims want to go to Mecca. It is something quite urgent,"" Chan said.Millions flock to the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the haj, although pilgrims come and go all year round. CENTRED IN MIDDLE EASTThe virus has also been found in Jordan, Qatar, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, while isolated cases have been exported to France, Britain and Germany by visitors.Saudi Arabia said on Friday that tighter controls had helped to stamped out a MERS-CoV outbreak in a hospital in the eastern region of al Ahsa, which infected 22 people, killing 10.""Certain infection control measures were applied because we thought there was some transmission happening in the areas where the patients were clustered. These included the ICU (intensive care unit) and the haemo-dialysis unit,"" Saudi Arabia's Deputy Health Minister Ziad Memish told the Geneva talks.The measures included separating patients or increasing the distance between them, and reduction of direct contact.Many questions remain about how the new virus spreads and what the vector may be, ranging possibly from animals to surface contamination. Saudi and WHO officials say there has been some contagion between people, but only where contact has been close and prolonged.Saudi authorities have collected a large number of samples from bats, camels, sheep and cats for testing, Memish said.Asked about the risk factors for contracting the disease, Memish said: ""It seems like being a male is a risk factor, being old is a risk factor; having underlying diseases including diabetes, heart disease and renal failure seem to be putting people at risk.""

Here are 10 quick and easy home dÃ©cor updates that will enliven your home for the warm months ahead.1. Use a Garden Stool as an Accent Table. Not just for the outdoors anymore, decorative ceramic accents come in an impressive array of colors and finishes and are the perfect pop of color and texture in a living room. 2. Add Brightly Colored Pillows to Your Bed. Nothing livens up a space like colorful accent pillows. Swap them out seasonally to completely change the look of your bedroom without breaking the bank.3. Paint an Accent Wall. When done right, an accent wall can help the rest of a room's dÃ©cor really sing. If you're not sure what color to choose, start by looking around your room -- there will likely be an accent color in a pillow, a piece of art, or an accessory that you can use as inspiration. The key is selecting an accent wall color that complements your dÃ©cor without drawing too much attention. 4. Swap Your Bedside Lampshades. If your lamp base has good ""bones,"" but the shade has seen better days, a replacement lampshade can revive its sluggish appearance. Not sure how to find out the lampshade size you need? Here's a handy guide on how to update your dÃ©cor with a new lamp shade.5. Put an Antique in an Unexpected Place. No matter your dÃ©cor style, an antique is the perfect finishing touch in a room by blending harmoniously with traditional dÃ©cor, or standing out among contemporary styling. Pick a piece with sentimental value, or choose a unique home accent at a flea market or estate sale.6. Hang a Gallery Wall. Small photographs and artworks can have a major design impact when hung together as a group. Here's an easy technique for hanging wall art that will make installing your gallery wall a breeze.7. Paint a Flea Market Find in High-Gloss Paint. Nothing revives a tired piece of furniture and gives it a new life like lacquer! Be sure to properly sand and prime the piece before painting to ensure a uniform, glossy finish. 8. Swap Out Builder's Basic Light Fixtures. If you live in a new home, chances are that many of your ceiling fixtures are inexpensive builder's basics. Close-to-ceiling lights (typically found in hallways, kitchens, and bathrooms) are easily exchanged with more stylish options. You can do this even if you're a renter -- just keep the original fixtures and make sure to re-install them when you move.9. Hang a Mirror Opposite a Window. The reflection will create the illusion of having more windows and natural light. 10. Dress up a Hallway or Entryway with a Runner. Area rugs are often viewed as a design necessity for living rooms and dining rooms - but why not in the hallway and entryway too? A beautiful runner can bring color, pattern, and softness into an otherwise ""hard"" space.Whether you incorporate just one or all 10, these easy home dÃ©cor ideas can provide an instant update to your space this summer."

No, seriously. These are the kinds of things we get excited over. The great thing about attending summer grilling parties, is that the hosts almost always have passionate feelings about the main dishes. Be they burgers, hot dogs, some other low-and-slow smoked dish that actually gets to be called ""barbecue"" -- the main course is all theirs. This leaves tons of open options for friends to bring their favorite side dish. Some people love pasta salad. Some people love to bring dessert. For us, it's all about the vegetables. We wait all year long for summer vegetables to finally be in season, and once they are, we want to eat them in every possible application we can.

One minute you're in a bad mood, the next you're finger-drumming along to your favorite Florence And The Machine song, feeling zen as ever. But there's more to music than its notable ability to give us a metaphorical hug on a crummy day. Music is ""much more powerful than you imagine,"" says Marc Neikrug, a composer of contemporary classical music who has performed in both the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestra.Neikrug wrote his most recent composition, Healing Ceremony, with (as the title suggests) healing in mind. ""I started thinking about people who get sick -- not just cancer -- but anytime someone finds out from their doctor that something is really wrong with them,"" he told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""I thought about the power music has over people; I wanted to write something that would change how your body feels -- helping you calm down, handle stress, get in touch with inner feelings and inner thoughts.""The composer, who has lived on a Pueblo reservation in Santa Fe, New Mexico for over two decades, incoporporated elements of the the nation's healing ceremony into his music to inspire a calmness and grounding for his listeners. ""I've known the [Pueblo] culture for 25 years, their sense of the earth, of their place connected to the earth -- this is a huge factor in their way of looking at life. It's very powerful in feeling grounded,"" Neikrug explains. Healing Ceremony was originally drafted to soothe cancer patients, but Neikrug found it to have an impact on people dealing with a spectrum of hardship -- particularly stress. ""This is not a treatment, but it surely can put you in the right place."" He explains that the right kind of music ""is an antidote to your stressful feelings."" Even more, the composer says that the right beat can lower your blood pressure, slow your pulse and really put you at ease. And he's right: Music has a wide range of effects on our physical and mental health. Studies show that listening to music can lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety and  even reduce the intensity of which we feel pain. Neikrug suggests listening to the composition in its entirety when life feels heavy. ""No, it won't make your boss a better person,"" he says, but it will facilitate feelings of calm. No time for the whole thing? Play the last track and ""give yourself 10 minutes of a beautiful place to be in.""The next time you decide to tune in to something in order to chill out, consider your intention when you hit the play button. ""People should be much more conscious of the power that music has upon all of them -- meaning your body and everything thatâs going on inside of you,"" Neikrug suggests. ""Itâs not just, 'Oh this is cool -- it makes me want to dance,' itâs much more complicted than that."" Also On HuffPost: For more on music, click here. "

According to AAA 32.4 million Americans will travel over this holiday, the symbolic start of the summer travel season. Most of these travelers will choose to drive.

Air travel will be down, but let's face, it once you land you're probably going to hit the highway to get to your final destination. And the roads will be full.)What's the best way to survive your the trip?Timing is everything. Travel during off hours. No, really. New Yorkers know not to head to the shore or the Catskills Friday night. If you have any control over your schedule, take an extra day off or travel at night. After dark, it will be cooler in the car, less taxing on your engine and you'll probably burn less fuel. Plus, the kids will sleep. Big rigs also take a break in the evening, so fewer trucks on the highway. Otherwise, avoid city centers and major interstate exchanges during rush hour or the hours right after lunch. Driver swaps. Whether you're traveling 30 miles or the average road-trip distance of 690 miles to get to your summer fun, switching drivers is a smart idea. It gives everyone a chance to stretch their legs, reach into the trunk for anything they need and reduce driver stress. A refreshed driver is an alert driver. Try to swap every two to three hours, more frequently in high traffic.Pack smart. After crisscrossing the country over the past few years and covering it on our family travel blog we've learned some very important things. We pack too much into the car and we need more snacks. Our new mantra is: twice the snacks, half the clothes. Snacks keep the kids and adults happy and reduce the stressful edge of food anxiety. And believe me when I say, you can find a shopping center or laundry in every town, even Beverly Hills! Pump right. The average price of a gallon of unleaded fuel is $3.67, which is down slightly from this time last year. If your drive is ""average"" fill up at your favorite gas station and then use the Gas Buddy app on your iphone to find cheap fuel along the way to your destination.Stop along the way. If you follow our advice on driver swapping, frequent stops come naturally. But with a little planning, or luck, you'll find some interesting places to pull over and explore. These quick visits help break up the monotony of the road and give the whole family a chance to stretch their legs, get some cold water or snack before moving on.We have so many great stop-memories, we could write a whole story about it. Some of our favorite stops were Arizona's Grand Canyon and the Meteor Crater both near Interstate 40, watching sea elephants at AÃ±o Nuevo State Park off California's Highway 1, the Newberry National Volcanic Monument in Oregon's Deschutes National Forest.We really regretted not stopping at the Petrified Forest National Park on our way to New Mexico from Arizona. Or the Canadian Badlands on a recent visit to Alberta. Something for the next drive, maybe?Follow these tips and you'll find the journey may be as exciting as the destinations. But most important, stay alert and be careful out there. Not everyone will see this story."
