Rage and blame comfort suffering, or at least serve as a distraction from devastation. As much as everyone craves answers regarding the events in Boston, there is much to learn from this horrific occurrence beyond the details that have yet to be revealed. Although it is human to seek vengeance against those who have caused pain, if this mindset is maintained our geo-political atmosphere will forever be at war.It is hard not to feel personally connected to these events, as it reminds us that America is not immune to war-like attacks. My Facebook newsfeed has been divided between furious status updates filled with wrath, and indifference because this type of violence happens all over the world -- often as a result of our military, and with less media attention. Some are feeling hateful towards those responsible, while others post ""while the world is 'shocked' by Boston Bombing: at the same time 7 Palestinians were killed, 55 deaths in Iraq by bombings, 32 other random killings in Iraq, 12 deaths in Afghanistan... and we could go on... But 'less' important?""I find all of these reactions legitimate, but wonder if they have to be mutually exclusive? Of course those directly impacted by loss will be in a state of mourning, but those of us observing this catastrophe in Boston have an opportunity to extend compassion not only to those in Boston, but also to those around the globe who live with violence as a part of their everyday existence. We can acknowledge the pain and fear that exists both here, and throughout the world. America hasn't fought a war on its land since the 1800s. The majority of Americans have no idea what war is like to live with or the fear people experience in their daily lives because of our military activity. Besides the American men and women who are actually fighting on our behalf, most of us have been sheltered from the violence caused by wars. Many American children are taught in schools that war is good for the economy. As a nation we are disconnected from the human impact and instead told justifications and propaganda. Our physical distance keeps us ignorant of the real consequences. Yes, terrorism happens, and yes there is the instinct to want to eliminate the terrorists that cause these events. But as we've learned, attacking entire countries does not combat terrorism, it actually inspires more people to become terrorists as innocent lives become casualties. It is impossible to fight wars and not risk the deaths of many who had no involvement. This creates individuals who then feel like they need justice against us -- feeding into more terrorism. And in turn we want justice against the terrorists who attack us. But where does it end? September 11th was organized by an extremist, but the U.S. government waged wars we are still fighting today on the countries that were unfortunate enough to be associated with terrorism. The ancient Greek drama of the Oresteia is a trilogy that examines the concept of revenge. An endless cycle of death is perpetuated by an eternal state of avenging and by a paradigm of retaliation. Violence, murder and war are all the offspring of this mentality. You killed someone close to me, therefore I kill what is sacred to you. Gandhi said it perfectly: ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."" A judicial system was created to hold people accountable for their wrongdoings in Oresteia. Rather than having countries going to war because of the actions of the few, there has to be more of an effort put into the global court system for rendering justice against terrorist acts -- which according to Noam Chomsky, the United States is the only country ever to be convicted in the World Court of terrorism. If events in Boston only elicit more divisive energy and hatred towards other nations, we are missing the point. In order for this culture of war to change, birthing empathy from these types of experiences is the first step.I hope that the Boston Marathon tragedy will inspire us to connect more directly to our sense of empathy. Empathy is not just about identifying with another person, but also relating to them so completely that actions change as a consequence. Perhaps we'll see that what happened in Boston was not a random act of terrorism; it was like any act of combat. As much as it pains us to experience this on our soil, we have to acknowledge that this is the price of allowing our government to be in a constant state of war, an act which also creates terror in the lives of innocent people everyday. If we want to be safer here, we have to commit to making it safer everywhere."

I suited up in a black dress, leggings, black leather jacket, black eye makeup... you get the picture. Who cares? Indeed. But this information is important to the end of the story. (Well, no, important is a strong word, particularly for this.) Anyway, I headed to Chelsea to see the film Bluebird.Bluebird is a smart and subtle reminder of how exquisitely fragile the balance of our everyday lives are. A small, seemingly insignificant event, like stopping to admire a bluebird, can contribute to a tragedy whose ripple effects permanently mark the lives of many. Lance Edmands' feature debut (and last night's Tribeca Opening Night film) is filled with impressive performances, particularly from Louisa Krause and Amy Morton, and spattered with snow covered landscapes, anchoring us in a feeling of never-ending winter. The film was a Sundance Institute Lab Project and I was very happy to see Lance, DP Jody Lee Lipes, and producer Kyle Martin, who have worked on getting this film made for almost four years, send such an accomplished piece out into the world. Clearly I go to TFF for the movies, but as a New Yorker, I appreciate that with the festival comes open bars. After the screening, I headed over with Alia Shawkat, Sarah Ramos, Elijah Wood, and others to the film Setup, Punch's after-party. Wood was DJing with records he carried onto the plane himself and my favorite part of the party was watching Sarah Ramos eat two pieces of Alia's birthday cake (she has quite the sweet tooth) and then pass out during the stand up comedy portion of the evening. Wyatt Cenac performed (but she was awake for his act) and Fabrizio Morretti ♥ stopped by to say hello to the birthday girl. Sebastian Silva (director of Crystal Fairy out this July, which is a must-see), was the best dancer there. Seriously, it borderline made me feel bad about myself. TFF has really branched out the past few years, extending into practically every neighborhood in Manhattan, including mine. Despite that, I've never gone so far as to call it my hometown festival. Is that because it's still newer than most festivals? When I finally got home, it was late. Seated on my stoop were three young gentlemen. They looked at my outfit and shouted ""Hey it's Lara Croft! Tomb Raider."" I laughed. ""That's not a bad comparison,"" I thought as I put my key in the door. Then one of them looked at my butt and said, ""I'd like to get in that tomb."" My first thought was: ""It moments like this that I wish I owned a taser."" My second thought: ""Lily, thank God you don't own a taser, you'd use it all the time and probably bankrupt your friends who are only trying to help bail you out of jail."" Third: ""Why don't you have a comeback? You're going to kick yourself later for that"" and then finally, as I stepped inside: ""Ah Tribeca Film Festival, well done. It was opening night and I got to see a friend's first indie feature, go to a perfectly lovely party and I'm back home safe and sound with these little perverts where I belong. I love NY."""

Life at the ""lipstick building,"" headquarters of the largest scale Ponzi scheme in financial history was wholesome and nurturing. They were family. But when she phoned Bernie to ask what gives, he was abrupt and perfunctory. And that's when it hit her: this was for real.That's the story Eleanor Squillari wrote in Vanity Fair, now told in a new riveting documentary, In God We Trust, premiering at the Tribeca Film Festival, directed by Victor Kubicek and Derek Anderson. Interview subjects --journalists, Madoff employees, and victims -- talk about what they knew of Madoff's empire, especially as far as who knew what about the ""investing"" of funds for an elite clientele, and the goings on at the mysterious 17th floor where no one dared tread. Having defied Bernie's order to destroy all documents, Squillari was later able to help the government's investigation by piecing together information from her copious records, continuing with her own ""war room"" of inquiry. It's an awesome paper trail, mindboggling in its numbers. And, the business would continue today, if not for the crash of 2008. In attendance at the premiere were Eleanor Squillari, newly married and now living in Florida, and Madoff son Andrew, barely recognizable as he is undergoing chemo. He was with his girlfriend Catherine Hooper. You may remember the couple from their many television appearances for her book on the subject. They stayed in the audience for the Q&A at the SVA Theater, when many questions were asked: How much did Ruth, his mother, know? Or, were he and his brother Mark who famously committed suicide also involved? While the story of Bernie Madoff's crime fascinates in its complicated enormity, In God We Trust provides a coherent narrative of events that begs more questions than it can answer. A follow up might include interviews with Madoff's mistresses, and hookers. But when it comes to the storied money, of who knew what, where and how, in whose account can we trust?A version of this post also appears on Gossip Central."

A massive probe was underway Tuesday after two bombs struck the Boston Marathon, killing at least three and wounding more than 100. Monday's blasts near the finishing line raised fears of a terrorist attack more than a decade after nearly 3,000 people were killed in suicide airliner strikes on New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. US President Barack Obama went on national television to warn against 'jumping to conclusions' but a senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such an attack was 'clearly an act of terror.'

For the 17,000 or so runners who crossed, their accomplishment is darkened by a coward's attack on the greatest spectators in the world. For the approximately 5,000 runners whose run to Boston was halted, they have unfinished business to take care of. And for me, I carry my finisher's medal with a heavy heart. A bittersweet accomplishment, really. After years of watching my mom's uncle run the Boston Marathon, I knew I had to follow in his footsteps. I had to make the 26.2-mile trek from Hopkinton into my city. I qualified for the 2013 race through the American Liver Foundation's Run for Research charity team. I raised more than $5,000 for liver research, something more difficult than the training itself. As the months, weeks, days and then hours ticked by to my 10:40 a.m. starting time on Patriots' Day, I was overwhelmed with emotion (and nausea). This was it. The gun went off. Some 10 paces in, my eyes welled up. A smile came across my face. ""I am running the Boston Marathon,"" I thought. The downhill miles ticked by fairly quickly. But not too quickly. I maintained my training pace -- 8:45. ""Don't go out too fast,"" I thought. ""The downhills now will kill you later."" Before I knew it, I was in Framingham. I checked myself out in a storefront's windows, which had been turned into mirrors. ""Look at those legs,"" I thought. Approaching mile 10.5, I saw my first fans watching from where we used to cheer on my mom's uncle. It was just what I needed to propel me up the course's first hill into Wellesley. I approached the infamous Scream Tunnel at Wellesley College. Checking my watch, I saw I'd clear the halfway point several minutes under two hours. Perfect. Right on pace. I enjoyed the last mile or two of downhill before making my way to Newton Wellesley Hospital (where I was born nearly 26 years ago). The American Liver Foundation had set up camp here, and I had been one of the first team members to run by in my orange ""Run for Research"" singlet. Just past the hospital I saw my parents, my husband and my father-in-law. They were holding signs and screaming. But there was no time to stop. I had to keep my almost perfectly even splits. I quickly ran by and made the famous right turn at the Newton fire station. Now the race was getting started: Heartbreak Hill. Nearing mile 21, I almost missed my close high school and college friends. But they spotted me. ""Hey, is that Heather?"" one of them called out. I veered to the right, ecstatic. ""Do you see what my sign says?"" my close running friend asked. ""It says, you can eat this hill for breakfast!"" Her words of encouragement and her pacing brought me to the top of the last heartbreaking hill. I had to take it from here, she said. After the hills, my pace was hovering around 9:15. I could see my goal of breaking four hours slowly slip away. How? I had run sub-nines for the first half of the race! But as I ran downhill through Boston College, the drunken shrieks, cheers, high-fives, pulled me closer and closer to the Boylston Street finish. I grimaced every time my feet hit the pavement. My quads were in searing pain. No amount of reading about the downhills of the Boston course could have prepared me. Next time I'll train downhill. Miles 22 through 25 were utter misery. I frantically tried to calculate how much farther I had to go against my pace time. Would I break four hours? At mile 24.75 my watch read 3:41. A sinking feeling. No. I wasn't going to do it. And then it happened. Somehow, from somewhere deep inside me, I found a little more juice. I pushed through Kenmore Square, barely glancing up at my family. I knew they were there, that was good enough. And then like a mirage, the sign: One mile to go. This is it. Dig.I make the famous right turn onto Hereford Street. Slight uphill. And then the even more famous left turn onto Boylston Street. I check my watch. Well under four hours. I thought about slowing down. I had sub-four in the bag, why keep pushing? But then I remember something Steve ""Pre"" Prefontaine said. And fittingly, what a friend wrote on his sign back at Heartbreak Hill. ""To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift."" I had to leave it all on the course. The medics could take care of me if I collapsed. Sprint. As I cross the most famous finish line in the world, they say my name. I make sure to look up at the cameras. I need to get my medal before I collapse. I stagger through the hoards of people. I collect my mylar blanket. Some water. Gatorade. A banana. And then I spot the medals. They place it on my neck and I feel like a champion. That feeling was gone in minutes. I am about to turn off Boylston Street, asking for directions to the Westin, where my team was meeting. Boom. I turn around and see a plume of smoke. And then another boom. Another plume. Someone says it must be a generator. But two? I think it must be cannons like they have at Patriots games every time the Pats score. But I finished around four hours. Surely the cannons would be fired once the elites crossed. And wouldn't I have known about this tradition? No, it's not cannons. It's not a generator. Starting to worry, I try to call my family. No service. I borrow a volunteer's phone. No answer.I keep walking, looking for the hotel as I start to shiver under my space blanket. I try my phone again and reach my husband. ""Are you OK?"" I ask. ""Yeah, why?"" I explain. He updates Facebook to let people know I am safe. After what seems like an eternity of pacing in the North America Ballroom of the Westin, I saw my mom. I ran to her and we both started crying hysterically. It hit me that I was minutes away from being caught in the massacre. A 21st-century Boston Massacre. Once we were safely out of the city I came to the realization that we wouldn't celebrate my sub-four marathon (3:56:41). We could try, but it would be tainted.The next 48 hours were a roller coaster of emotions. People told me to enjoy my achievement, but how? Those victims, that 8-year-old boy, were injured and killed supporting us runners. The horrific irony of spectators losing their legs as they watched people complete a 26.2 mile run. But I'm a marathoner now. I've proven to myself and the city of Boston that I can persevere through physical and mental toil. My legs are resilient. Days after conquering the unforgiving course, I can make my way down the stairs without holding onto a railing. My mind is resilient. The tears come less now. But it's hard to hear people call my finish line a crime scene. But I'm a marathoner. I will overcome. And more importantly, I will toe the line in Hopkinton in 2014.For more by Heather Mayer Irvine, click here.For more on the Boston Marathon bombing, click here."

A wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker this week showed two Yankees fans wearing Boston Red Sox uniforms. Even Yankees fans can put aside their rivalry in the face of tragedy.This pattern is similar to one we have seen before following horrible events. After the 9/11 attacks, French newspaper Le Monde ran a headline saying, ""We Are All Americans."" Why do we feel closer to others in times of crisis?There is a prominent framework in social psychology called ""terror management theory"" that helps us to understand this behavior. This theory starts with the observation that -- as human beings -- we are probably the only species on the planet that are able to think about our own death. This creates a kind of existential terror. We know that some day we will not exist any more. How do we deal with this knowledge that some day we will die?In order to relieve the anxiety that comes with think about our death, we try to find ways that we will live on beyond our years. One way that we do this is to strengthen our ties to the groups we belong to and to our culture more broadly. So, the typical Yankees fan may usually be focused on the rivalry between the Yankees and the Red Sox. In times of threat, though, the identity as an American becomes more important, because that is something that will live on. And in that moment, the distinction between the Yankees and the Red Sox fades into the background.There is a downside to terror management as well. People who are dealing with thoughts of death tend to treat others who fall outside the group and who violate the social norms of a group negatively. In times of crisis, we judge others particularly harshly. In the case of suspected terrorists, this judgment can ultimately lead to abuses. Those who committed the atrocities on 9/11 deserve to be punished. Similarly, as the plot related to the bombing of the Boston Marathon becomes clear, all of those responsible should be brought to justice.However, in the aftermath of 9/11, we also condoned torture of suspects and the suspension of due process. Well over a decade after 9/11, we still hold prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. We have denied them the rights we give to U.S. citizens. Our need to grapple with threats to our existence makes it easier to dehumanize those we see as the enemy. Ultimately, we do not want to lose our own humanity as we grapple with events like the tragedy in Boston. That is how the terrorists win.For more by Art Markman, Ph.D., click here.For more on emotional intelligence, click here."
