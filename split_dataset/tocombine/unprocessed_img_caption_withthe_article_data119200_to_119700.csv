the first time in human history more than half the world's population is living in cities. That's more than 3 billion people with an estimated 60 million more of us moving to cities every year. By 2050, world population is projected to be 9.3 billion, of which around 70 percent -- or approximately 6.5 billion people -- are expected to live in urban areas. This increase in population growth brings several challenges; cities must plan for increased demand for services: energy, food and water, transportation, housing, land, health, education and much more. Equally important is the need to address increasing urban inequality. Poverty and slum growth are a well-known trademark of rapidly urbanized areas. Income inequality perpetuates an urban economic divide. As the physical and social distance between poor and rich urban neighborhoods increases, the poorest are increasingly subject to social exclusion, marginalization, higher incidence of crime, job restrictions, unequal access to education opportunities, poor health outcomes, and unequal access to market opportunities and public services. Richard Florida addressed the United Nations at the United Nations Economic and Social Council recently. Watch the conversation on sustainable urbanization: "

He was not just a pharmacologist, author, and medical chemist, but a pioneer in drug policy reform.",2014-06-04,"A Sept. 6, 2008, photo released by Greg Manning is of Alexander Shulgin in San Francisco. Shulgin, a respected chemist famed for dusting off a decades-old recipe for the psychedelic drug ecstasy, died Monday, June 3, 2014, at his Northern California home. He was 88. (AP Photo/Greg Manning)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cbdd3c000020010df5e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sasha Shulgin, who passed away Monday at the age of 88, was many things to many people. He was not just a pharmacologist, author, and medical chemist, but a pioneer in drug policy reform.Best known for introducing MDMA to psychologists in the '70s, and for synthesizing more than 200 psychedelic drugs, Shulgin was previously a chemist for Dow Chemical before he moved on in 1965 to pursue his own research. This led him to publish the apparently-evergreen books PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved) and TiHkal (Tryptamines I Have Known And Loved) with his wife, Ann.Shulgin is also a longtime member of the Drug Policy Alliance's Honorary Board. Twenty-five years ago, he joined DPA's Ethan Nadelmann, who was then a professor at Princeton, in a seminal working group of academics and intellectuals who set out to envision the future of drug policy and alternatives to prohibition. When Congress passed the Federal Analogs Act in 1986 -- right at the height of the U.S. drug hysteria -- it essentially criminalized Shulgin's life's work. Sasha passionately believed in the need for reforming drug laws and ending the drug war. He wrote a few years ago:""I strongly advocate the repeal of all federal drug laws. The states then would be free to add this, or remove that, according to the wishes of its population. Eventually all state laws prohibiting drugs would, in time, also be repealed. Oh, some will have to remain -- the giving of drugs to minors, or to people without their consent, or driving a car while intoxicated. But the war on drugs is an abysmal failure and must be retired.""Sasha's perspective was rooted in the principle of human freedom -- and the right of each and every one of us to sovereignty over our own minds and bodies. That principle is fundamental to Sasha's legacy. (And a principle articulated in DPA's mission and vision.)Sasha also recognized that this principle did not just extend to people who learn and benefit from marijuana and psychedelics. He recognized that this principle needs to extend to the entire world of psychoactive substances. He recognized that even with substances that can be more dangerous and problematic, the government should not be able to intrude on people's sovereignty, if we are to live in a free society.It's striking that Sasha was able to achieve so many epic accomplishments despite the vicious and relentless nature of the war on drugs. While Sasha didn't end up behind bars, hundreds of thousands of people have been arrested or imprisoned for producing or even just possessing one of the substances that Sasha discovered.Perhaps in the future, our society can evolve to the point where we welcome geniuses like him rather than marginalizing them.Jag Davies is the publications manager at the Drug Policy Alliance(www.drugpolicy.org)This piece first appeared on the Drug Policy Alliance Blog: http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/rip-alexander-sasha-shulgin-godfather-ecstasy-and-drug-policy-reform-pioneer"

Nathan Deal, R-Ga., speaks at the Law Enforcement Cookout at Wayne Dasher's pond house in Glennville, Ga., on Thursday, April 17, 2014. A crowd of over one thousand law enforcement, government officials and guests from across the state of Georgia gathered to enjoy BBQ and Brunswick stew at the annual event. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cbac240000300098f2b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The federal government has put the state of Georgia on formal notice that it can't make poor people take drug tests when they apply for food stamps. In April, Gov. Nathan Deal (R) signed a law requiring the state to test any food stamp applicants suspected of being on drugs starting in 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture told the Georgia Department of Human Services on Tuesday that states can't make up new eligibility standards for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, so drug tests are a no-no. ""Requiring SNAP applicants and recipients to pass a drug test in order to receive benefits would constitute an additional condition of eligibility, and therefore, is not allowable under law,"" regional USDA administrator Robin Bailey said in the letter. Last year, Republicans in Congress tried but failed to give states the power to screen SNAP applicants. Drug test proposals for all manner of safety net programs have been popular with Republicans in recent years despite a dearth of evidence that welfare users are drug abusers. Some forms of drug testing are allowed for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which, like food stamps, is a federal program administered by states. But overly broad proposals, like one in Florida, have been rejected by the courts. In 2012, Georgia lawmakers approved a TANF drug-testing law modeled on Florida's, but it was never implemented because of constitutional concerns."
7,ENTERTAINMENT,Has Angelina Jolie Actually Been In Any Good Movies?,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/angelina-jolie-movies_n_5413545.html,,2014-06-03,"Angelina Jolie arrives at the world premiere of &quot;Maleficent&quot; at the El Capitan Theatre on Wednesday, May 28, 2014, in Los Angeles. (Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb45d8b3c000066000c96b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Angelina Jolie may be America's biggest female movie star. You might argue with that notion -- throw in names like Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Lawrence, and the discussion gets murky -- but the 38-year-old actress, who turns 39 on June 4, is one of the most recognizable and desired faces in Hollywood. An Oscar winner (1999's ""Girl Interrupted"") and acclaimed director, Jolie has remained a tabloid fixture since her blood-toting relationship with Billy Bob Thornton made headlines in the early 2000s. A $33 million income made Jolie the highest-paid actress of 2013. (In 2011, she shared the same honor with Sarah Jessica Parker and earned only $2 million more than longtime headline rival Jennifer Aniston, but their complicated dynamic is old news, so we'll lay that ordeal to rest.)In spite of everything going for her, Jolie's repute comes with something none of the other aforementioned actresses have: a startling deficit of great movies. A cursory look at Jolie's filmography reveals a dearth of critical darlings and a grab bag of box-office results. In short, were she not the formidable Angelina Jolie, her resume would be one step removed from a fiasco. (Does anyone have fond remembrances of ""The Bone Collector,"" ""Pushing Tin,"" ""Playing God,"" ""Alexander,"" ""The Tourist"" and ""Changeling""?)BuzzFeed's Anne Helen Petersen recently wrote an in-depth exploration of Jolie's expertise when it comes to playing the celebrity-image game, and it's true: Somehow Jolie's identity has escalated beyond the need for critical praise or steady film grosses, both of which she has seen, but neither of which she can rely on. Case in point: ""Maleficent"" just became Jolie's highest-grossing opening weekend to date, but Disney's reimagining of ""Sleeping Beauty"" debuted to a lukewarm reception from many critics. After 19 years as a lead star, let's see how many of Jolie's projects have proved fruitful (hint: not many).Notes: Only live-action roles are listed, so no ""Kung-Fu Panda"" or ""Beowulf."" All box-office tallies are domestic grosses adjusted for inflation.""Hackers"" (1995)  Role: A high school computer hacker known as Acid Burn. Rotten Tomatoes score: 34 percent Box office: $13.8 million Sample review: ""'Hackers,' the new information highway thriller, is tirelessly modish, hyper-glossy, super-superficial. It's also cacophonous. And, for all of its drum-beating for brain power, dumb."" -- Hal Hinson, The Washington Post""Foxfire"" (1996)  Role: A drifter named Legs who convinces her three classmates to fight back against sexual advances made by their biology teacher. Rotten Tomatoes score: 30 percent Box office: $485,000 Sample review: ""Joyce Carol Oates will be disappointed with the muddled screen version of “Foxfire,” her bestselling novel about female bonding and empowerment. The film deals with a relevant issue, sexual harassment in school, but tyro director Annette Haywood-Carter gives it the glossy music-video treatment, overpowering the screen with sensual imagery and a clamorous soundtrack that trivializes the thematic significance. ... Playing a glamorous anti-heroine, Jolie gets full star treatment from the director, with the camera caressing her sexy lips, big breasts and beautiful eyes with an almost fetishistic glee."" -- Emanuel Levy, Variety""Playing God"" (1997)  Role: The girlfriend of a crime boss.  Rotten Tomatoes score: 14 percent Box office: $7.2 million Sample review: ""What can you say about a time-waster like 'Playing God' with its multiple murders, corrupt FBI agents, obligatory car chase and dumb, self-referential, four-letter-word humor? Movies like this are so plentiful and derivative and life-negating that any thinking filmgoer is doomed to feel soiled -- if not despairing about the human condition -- after witnessing a string of them."" -- Edward Guthmann, San Francisco Chronicle""Gia"" (1998)  Role: Fashion model Gia Carangi, who becomes addicted to cocaine and heroin. Rotten Tomatoes score: 92 percent Box office: N/A (HBO film) Sample review: ""As Gia, [Jolie] is a multifaceted revelation, shifting from coquettish to nasty to violent to contrite with a breathtaking believability. The passion with which she inhabits the role is a spectacle in itself; it doesn’t hurt that she’s also a spectacular beauty."" -- Ray Richmond, Variety""Hell's Kitchen"" (1998)  Role: The daughter of a drug addict. Rotten Tomatoes score: 40 percent Box office: $18,300 Sample review: N/A""Playing By Heart"" (1998)  Role: A struggling actress who follows her lover from one nightclub to the next. Rotten Tomatoes score: 60 percent Box office: $6.2 million Sample review: ""It amounts to a near-miss. It's easy to like the movie because we like the actors in it, and because the movie makes it easy on us and has charming moments. But it feels too much like an exercise. It's yuppie lite -- affluent, articulate people who, except for those who are ill, have problems that are almost pleasant."" -- Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times""Pushing Tin"" (1998)  Role: An air-traffic controller's wife who swaps partners with her husband's new colleague. Rotten Tomatoes score: 48 percent Box office: $13.2 million Sample review: ""Think the swinging-dick mentality of 'Top Gun,' but in an ergonomic desk chair. Written by the cocreators of 'Cheers,' 'Pushing Tin' pivots on our dubious fascination with professional erection duels, which are a sad substitute for dramatic conflict."" -- Michael Atkinson, The Village Voice""The Bone Collector"" (1999)  Role: A patrol cop who helps to track down a serial killer. Rotten Tomatoes score: 28 percent Box office: $104 million Sample review: ""The camera is even more enamored of Ms. Jolie, with her impossibly sensual lips and eyes that brim with a soft melting fire. In sheer smoldering screen charisma, Ms. Jolie has every other young Hollywood actress beat hands down. Whether she can really act remains to be seen."" -- Stephen Holden, The New York Times""Girl, Interrupted"" (1999)  Role: A sociopath committed to a mental institution. Rotten Tomatoes score: 54 percent Box office: $42.7 million Sample review: ""Does it matter that every time Jolie's offscreen the film wilts a little? Ryder should be perfect as the bright spark; her lines are sharp as a knife. There's a gap, however, between what we hear and what we see."" -- Charlotte O'Sullivan, Time Out""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (2000)  Role: Sway, one-fifth of a gang of a car thieves. Rotten Tomatoes score: 25 percent Box office: $150 million Sample review: ""Even hardcore escapists are bound to be defeated by the generic tough-guy twaddle and the impersonal race/crash/explode action sequences: Eventually, the senses jam and a mental lube job is in order."" -- Lisa Schwarzbaum, Entertainment Weekly""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" (2001)  Role: Lara Croft, the butt-kicking archaeologist from the ""Tomb Raider"" video-game series. Rotten Tomatoes score: 19 percent Box office: $184.5 million Sample review: ""It doesn't matter if you have a $100 million budget to travel to Iceland and Cambodia -- both look great, by the way -- if your plot is incoherent. Among the special effects, the stone monkeys rock, but you might be more distracted by the fact that Jolie's breasts seem to balloon and deflate from scene to scene. In the department of numbing ineptitude, the pacing runs a neck-and-neck race with the dialogue."" -- Peter Travers, Rolling Stone""Original Sin"" (2001)  Role: An American who marries a wealthy Cuban in the 19th century and then disappears with his riches. Rotten Tomatoes score: 12 percent Box office: $23.3 million Sample review: ""Scarcely original, but full of sin, 'Original Sin,' starring Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie, is neither epochal nor epic in its ludicrousness. It's just run-of-the-mill trash."" -- Wesley Morris, San Francisco Chronicle""Life, or Something Like It"" (2002)  Role: A TV reporter who's told she has seven days left to live. Rotten Tomatoes score: 28 percent Box office: $19.8 million Sample review: ""Not for a second do you believe that Ms. Jolie is playing someone faced with the unpleasant fact of imminent mortality. Granted, the premise is both maudlin and absurd, but there are plenty of actresses -- Ashley Judd and Michelle Pfeiffer immediately come to mind -- who might have made both the humor and the sentiment at least passably credible. Without the opportunity to be either sultry or histrionic, Ms. Jolie lurches from dewy self-pity to manic hostility without appearing to feel a thing."" -- A.O. Scott, The New York Times""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life"" (2003)  Role: Lara Croft, this time hunting down Pandora's Box. Rotten Tomatoes score: 28 percent Box office: $86.7 million Sample review: ""It's all quite busy and bombastic, and there's nothing wrong -- in fact, there's a lot right -- with watching Jolie be her spectacular self in cool costumes and exotic locales. But the film's story and supporting characters -- including an untrustworthy love interest played by Gerard Butler -- aren't nearly enough to make 'The Cradle of Life' more than another sequel cashing in on its pre-sold audience without providing anything by way of sparkle, wit or originality."" -- Ann Hornaday, The Washington Post""Beyond Borders"" (2003)  Role: A socialite who takes up humanitarian causes in Ethiopia. Rotten Tomatoes score: 14 percent Box office: $5.8 million Sample review: ""It's an easy picture to ridicule. After a while, you almost feel as if the stars are making fun of it. Or at least you wish Angelina Jolie, with her radiant presence and Panavision lips, and Clive Owen, with his brisk, existentialist cool, were smart enough to do so. After the 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' movies, with their globe-trotting superficiality and numbing imbecility, Ms. Jolie must feel she owes her fans something serious. Unfortunately, she is starring in a movie even more benumbed and superficial, a liberal video game that demeans the very refugees it tries to spotlight."" -- Elvis Mitchell, The New York Times""Taking Lives"" (2004)  Role: An FBI profiler who moves to Montreal to help track down a serial killer. Rotten Tomatoes score: 22 percent Box office: $41.9 million Sample review: ""It's a minor relief to know that, after a pair of preposterous love stories and a second forgettable stint as the tomb-raiding archeologist Lara Croft, Jolie is safely back in the arms of another murky-kinky piece of Hollywood trash."" -- Wesley Morris, Boston Globe""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" (2004)  Role: In an alternative 1939, the commander of a Royal Navy aircraft carrier.

8,TASTE,School Lunch Project: Get Your Kids To Try New Foods,"Laura Fuentes, ContributorFounder & CEO, MOMables.com, Author, kid friendly recipe d...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/school-lunch-project-get-_b_5406295.html,Who doesn't want their kid to eat more vegetables?,2014-06-03,2014-06-03-howtointroducenewfoodstokidsA466x700.jpg.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-03-howtointroducenewfoodstokidsA466x700.jpg-thumb.jpg,"Who doesn't want their kid to eat more vegetables? Pretty much every parent wishes their child ate better, accepting new foods when they are painstakingly prepared by mommy, slaving over a hot stove all day... No? Just broccoli? I thought so... Today, you're in luck because I was recently able to get some valuable information out of the author of the book It's Not About the Broccoli, Dr. Dina Rose, Ph.D. Dr. Rose is a sociologist, parent educator and child-feeding expert. Her goal is to empower parents to raise kids who eat well, with both health and enjoyment in mind. Through my lunch-planning service, MOMables, I create healthy and fresh school lunch plans for busy parents who want their children to eat well during the school day. Parents ask me every day about the best ways to introduce new foods to picky eaters as they struggle to get their children to eat the new foods they're presenting to them. I asked Dr. Rose a few questions about introducing foods to kids without a battle so that we could all have a bit more success in feeding our children a healthy diet with a larger variety of foods.MOMables: We know kids need food to be fun, but how do we make tasting a new food more fun?Dr. Dina Rose: You don't always have to stick to healthy items like asparagus and fish. Go to the ice cream parlor and sample new flavors of ice cream! Crack open a box of unfamiliar crackers! One surefire way to get kids psyched about trying new foods is to amp up the fun factor. I know that getting your kids to like more of these kinds of foods seems counterproductive, but it's not. It will help change your children's attitude towards new, and that's the goal.MOMables: Is this teaching our children to be 'tasters?'Dr. Dina Rose: Yes, trust that your children will naturally start eating new foods after they become comfortable tasters. It takes a lot of courage to put something into your mouth when you know absolutely nothing about it, and the information most parents give their kids -- ""yum, this is good"" -- just doesn't cut it. Being able to make predictions is key to trying new foods. Practice telling your children as much as you can about whatever food you want them to taste. ""This is crunchy like the chicken nuggets you like."" ""This is sweet, almost like a cookie."" Then, instead of asking your children if they like what they've tasted, ask them to describe something about the food.MOMables: How do they get past the initial resistance to try something new?Dr. Dina Rose: Never (and I mean never) ask your children to eat anything new! Settle for a taste. Or a touch. Or maybe even just a sniff. When it comes to teaching kids to enjoy new foods, pressure is your enemy. And -- at least from our kid's perspective -- being expected to eat something they've never tasted before is a lot of pressure.The shift from eating to tasting may not seem like a big deal. Most parents think that's what they're doing when they say to their kids, ""Just taste it, and if you don't like it, you don't have to eat it."" But if you hear this statement from your child's perspective -- ""If you do like it, you will have to eat it"" -- it's easier to see why some kids balk. Especially if you introduce new foods the way most parents do, by putting a big heap on the plate at dinner. What if your child doesn't want to eat it, or even thinks he might not want to eat it? The safest course of action is to not even taste it.Dr. Rose gives us these tips:1. Make tasting fun. 2. Take the surprise out of new foods. 3. Trust that your children will naturally start eating new foods after they become comfortable tasters.And she leaves us with this: ""As your children become accustomed to tasting new foods, they'll naturally want to taste even more new foods. And tasting will eventually lead to eating. No question about it."" Since interviewing Dr. Rose, I've been able to integrate some of her advice into our daily lives and I have to say my kids are turning into better 'tasters' themselves, although they've always been coerced into trying my recipes so they're pretty adventurous to begin with! What about you? Have you tried any of the above advice? What works for you to get your kids trying new foods in and out of the lunchbox?"

Contrary to what many in the conservative media have desperately suggested in recent days, unions are not the reason why the VA is facing a crisis over delays in providing health care to our nation's war heroes. In fact, unions are the solution.  The anti-government naysayers conveniently place the blame on officials from the American Federation of Government Employees and other unions, making outrageous and unsubstantiated claims alleging complicity in veterans' deaths. This is an insult of the highest order, and one that cannot go unanswered. What they and other critics of labor unions fail to realize, or refuse to acknowledge, is that the union fights not just for employees' interests but for the well-being of the men and women our employees serve. In fact, the nation wouldn't even know these problems existed if it wasn't for front-line employees and union representatives stepping forward to blow the whistle.AFGE union officers and unionized employees have been speaking out for years about the management and performance failings that have only now entered the public's consciousness. Unions are not the problem; neither are the hardworking and dedicated doctors, nurses and support staff who are providing world-class care to our nation's veterans and family members.We were at the table in the 1990s, providing our expertise on electronic health care records, bar code medications, and other patient safety advancements that helped transform the VA into the premier health care provider it is today.AFGE members are the critical eyes and ears on the ground at VA medical centers. Day in and day out, we share with lawmakers and veterans' groups the harsh effects of underfunding that limit the VA's ability to adequately care for our nation's veterans and their loved ones. AFGE and veterans' groups worked hand-in-hand to secure advance appropriations for the VA health care system so medical centers would have more stable and adequate funding. Unfortunately, thanks to lawmakers playing austerity politics with veterans, the VA is facing a $2 billion budget shortfall next year. That is certainly not the union's fault.We are the ones who witness the impact of performance measures that tie executive bonuses to how many patients can be moved through the queue, rather than on the quality of care those patients receive. It was these unrealistic performance goals that prompted some managers to game the system to show compliance and secure bonuses. This, again, was not the union's fault -- in fact, union activists are the ones who brought this situation to the light of day.We are the ones who are protecting employees from intimidation and retaliation for speaking out about these problems. For years, AFGE members have blown the whistle on outbreaks of disease, critical understaffing, and management malfeasance -- only to be met with swift management retaliation. Without union officials on the job to represent these brave employees, no one would dare risk their careers by coming forward. Management threats of privacy violations chill many employees from coming forward about specific patient care concerns, so union officials are the only secure channel for reporting safety and health issues. Veterans are safer with union watchdogs at the ready.In February 2013, AFGE local president Kathleen Dahl testified before the House Committee on Veterans Affairs regarding a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at the Pittsburgh VA Healthcare System and the subsequent cover-up by management officials. Prior to the hearing, however, Dahl was intimidated by a VA manager and told that she could ""call in sick"" instead of testifying. In 2011, Dr. Michelle Washington, a union activist with AFGE Local 342, testified before the Senate on issues of inadequate staffing, patient access to specialized care, prolonged wait times, and appointment data manipulation at the Wilmington VA Medical Center. Dr. Washington faced retaliation for her testimony, including having some of her duties as a psychologist removed and receiving negative marks on her performance evaluation.Today, AFGE members are being intimidated to keep quiet by the very managers who manipulated performance goals to ensure they received their bonuses. Meanwhile, the consequences of staffing shortages are swept under the carpet. Luckily, AFGE is there to help protect employees who have been retaliated against for speaking out and to serve as a voice for employees and veterans. We advocate for additional funding for VA programs and services, lobby for legislation to enhance whistleblower protections, and aid congressional oversight of the department.Of course our members do far more than keep VA management honest. They are the dedicated health care professionals who work face to face with veterans every day. When a veteran loses a leg in battle, our members are there for the months of rehabilitation and physical therapy needed to get him walking again. When warriors return from battle with scars invisible to the eye, VA psychiatrists help them to integrate back into the civilian world and their families. When veterans of past conflicts take their final breath, it is often a VA nurse or doctor holding their hand and wishing them farewell.It is the passion of these patriotic employees that makes the VA such a special system, and one worth fighting for. As I discussed in my previous column, the key challenges facing the VA health care system are chronic understaffing of physicians and other front-line providers, lack of resources for building and maintaining needed medical facilities, and a flawed performance system that focuses on moving patients through the door rather than improving their quality of care. We must encourage employees to speak out about these problems, and to protect them when they do. If we silence their voices, our veterans will be the ones who pay the ultimate price.J. David Cox Sr. is national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents more than 670,000 federal and D.C. government employees nationwide, including more than 210,000 in the Department of Veterans Affairs"
10,LATINO VOICES,Here's An Immigrant Imprisonment Program That Obama Could Stop Without Congress,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/operation-streamline-obama_n_5399979.html,,2014-06-03,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS DEC. 11, 2006 -- Migrants wait along the shore of the Rio Grande River in Piedras Negras, Mexico, Monday, Dec. 11, 2006, with milk jugs full of water used throughout their long journey to the border crossing. They plan to wait for a good time to cross the river into the U.S. Little do they know that they are planing to cross in an area where Border Patrol has started a program called Operation Streamline, where they prosecute all migrants who come into the U.S. illegally. DENVER POST PHOTO BY RJ SANGOSTI (Photo By RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae9c7e240000320054f7e2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last month, in the face of growing pressure from immigrant rights activists, Hispanic politicians and Democratic allies, President Barack Obama ordered the Department of Homeland Security to review the policies that drive the administration's record-setting pace of deportations. It remains to be seen what kind of changes will come as a result. Last week, the White House delayed the announcement of possible changes for two months in an effort to keep alive the debate over comprehensive reform. Activists have long demanded that Obama use his executive power to curtail deportations dramatically. But while the president supports a pathway to citizenship and has exempted from deportation many undocumented immigrants who arrived as children, he has maintained that he must enforce existing immigration law unless Congress passes comprehensive reform. However, the White House does appear to have the power to stop a program reviled by immigration activists and criticized by legal scholars that has helped inflate the percentage of deportees with criminal records in recent years. Begun under the George W. Bush administration, the program, known as Operation Streamline, charges people en masse with the crime of illegal entry (a misdemeanor) or illegal re-entry (a felony) after they have been caught illegally crossing the border. The detainees are given a jail sentence and then deported. Immigration activists and civil rights defenders have long opposed the program, citing concerns about due process and arguing that it diverts the courts' attention from more serious crimes. The Border Patrol first developed the idea for Operation Streamline in South Texas, according to the California Law Review. Amid growing numbers of illegal immigrants from Central America, who, unlike Mexicans, could not be immediately repatriated, the area was running out of bed space in detention centers, and authorities often had no choice but to allow apprehended immigrants to leave detention with a notice to appear in court. The Border Patrol suggested that the federal government prosecute non-Mexicans to create a deterrent for crossing illegally in the area and to funnel undocumented immigrants into the criminal justice system, where more bed space was available. The zero-tolerance program quickly spread to other jurisdictions and expanded to cover Mexican nationals. Today, under Operation Streamline, judges hear dozens of cases within hours, often convicting migrants in groups to save time. In an article published in February, New York Times reporter Fernanda Santos described the daily scene in a courthouse in Tucson, Arizona:Men and women arrested along the border, the chains around their ankles and wrists jingling as they move, are gathered to answer to the same charges -- illegal entry, a misdemeanor, and illegal re-entry, a felony. They have not had an opportunity to bathe since they set off to cross the desert; the courtroom has the smell of sweaty clothes left for days in a plastic bag. Side by side in groups of seven as they face the bench, they consistently plead guilty to a lesser charge, which spares them longer time behind bars. The immigration charge is often their only offense.Things weren't always this way. Tucson attorney Isabel Garcia worked as a federal public defender in the 1980s, when the crime of illegal entry was rarely prosecuted. She says she won several of those cases by challenging the admissibility of the immigrant's confession. ""In Tucson, it's the daily bread for those who work in this court system,"" Garcia said. ""Why are we doing this? We know there's violations of law everywhere. So don't give me this 'we prosecute every violation of the law,' because we don't."" Maintaining a program that leads to greater criminal prosecution of undocumented immigrants would seem to be at odds with a presidential administration that has called for comprehensive immigration reform and used prosecutorial discretion to make it more difficult to deport some undocumented immigrants. But the president of the National Immigration Judges Association, Dana Leigh Marks, says the current mandate to prosecute large volumes of illegal-entry and re-entry cases ultimately rests with the executive branch, rather than with Congress.""If it's a policy, it's not mandated by law,"" Marks told HuffPost. ""These prosecutions occur in a criminal context. They could choose to place people in immigration proceedings and not choose to prosecute them criminally in addition."" The White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Attorney's Office did not return requests for comment.Immigration-related crimes now make up the most-prosecuted category of crimes in federal courts, at 41 percent of the caseload in the 2012 fiscal year, according to the most recently available statistics from the U.S. Attorney's Office. Drug crimes took second place, at 22 percent, followed by violent crime at 19 percent. In April, the Blue Ribbon Commission, a group made up of undocumented and formerly undocumented activists, issued a call for the Obama administration to end Operation Streamline. The group called the proceedings ""dehumanizing"" and pointed out that in many cases those convicted are ""trying to return home to their families or flee prosecution."" Despite such criticisms, the program still has its supporters. Bernardo Velasco, a judge in Tucson, told The Huffington Post he hears about 350 Streamline cases every week. ""Everybody that appears before me has a lawyer appointed to represent them at no cost to them,"" said Velasco. ""Everyone that appears before me has had a chance to speak to their lawyer in the morning, to talk to the Mexican consulate at noon and to talk to me. So I'm satisfied that due process is more than dealt with."" Critics say that under the Streamline program, many people end up with a criminal offense on their record when they wouldn't otherwise have any. But Velasco told HuffPost that virtually everyone who appears before him is a repeat crosser, often with a previous conviction for illegal entry. ""That criticism is no longer valid because the people that are being prosecuted now have criminal records, and they're being offered a plea agreement that offers them less time than they could possibly get if they went through a felony proceeding,"" Velasco said. ""Every country in the world has the right to secure its borders.""In its annual report on deportations this year, the Department of Homeland Security highlighted that 59 percent of the 368,644 immigrants deported in 2013 had been convicted of a crime, the highest percentage in the last five years. But critics point out that many of the people labeled as criminal offenders in those statistics are guilty only of crossing the border illegally -- a crime that does not set them far apart from others who were apprehended outside the border zone or who fell out of lawful immigration status while overstaying a visa. Immigration offenses accounted for 54,812 of those crimes in 2013, according to TRAC -- 25 percent of the total. The number of deportees with an immigration conviction rose 167 percent between 2008 and 2013. At times, authorities have seemed almost comically enthusiastic about prosecuting immigration crimes. NPR reports that Mexican migrants have been stopped at legal ports of entry while they were trying to return to Mexico. Instead of simply being allowed to leave, they were detained, convicted of illegal entry and then deported -- all at taxpayer expense. ""It's fully under the purview of the administration whether to prosecute these cases,"" Vicki Gaubeca, director of the ACLU's Regional Center for Border Rights in New Mexico, told HuffPost. ""It's just a colossal waste of resources."""
11,CRIME,Filming Police in Public Places: A Risky First Amendment Activity for Citizen Journalists,"Clay Calvert, ContributorProfessor and Brechner Eminent Scholar in Mass Communication, ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/filming-police-in-public-_b_5424621.html,"Today, anyone and everyone has the capacity to be a journalist and to record with their smartphones potential abuses of government authority.",2014-06-03,Man used mobile phone camera take pictures in the Concert party,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2ace4240000300095dffc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let's start with a trio of foundational assumptions that affect us all as citizens and citizen journalists.  First, when people are situated in public venues, such as parks, streets or sidewalks, they have no reasonable expectation of privacy. What they do in those common locations thus is fair game for anyone else to witness and, in turn, to photograph and record.  Second, police officers and law enforcement officials are public servants and government employees. They work for us -- the taxpayers -- and their actions are not only of public interest, but of public concern.  Third, the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the freedom of speech against government censorship.  With those three suppositions in mind, it seems like a legal no-brainer that citizens have the right to film and record police officers performing their official duties in public places and to disseminate the resulting images to others as they see fit.But as TechDirt recently reported, ""people are still being arrested for recording police officers. Sometimes it's a bad (and outdated) wiretapping law that gets abused. Sometimes it's other, unrelated laws that are stretched to fit the circumstances, which means those recording officers are hit with charges ranging from interfering with police investigations to criminal mischief, depending on how the interaction goes.""For example, the Baltimore Sun reported in February 2014 on a man filming an arrest in Towson, Md., who allegedly was told by an officer to ""shut your [expletive mouth] or you're going to jail."" When the man replied he had a right of free speech, the officer retorted ""You just lost it.""  And in April, CBS News reported that Lazaro Estrada ""was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice after he recorded a Miami-Dade police officer arresting someone else outside a Cutler Bay, Fla., store.""In fact, a website is devoted to instances where law enforcement officials have arrested or otherwise allegedly harassed people who try to videotape or capture photographs of police officers doing their job in public places. It is appropriately called Photography is Not a Crime.A May 29 post describes how an officer with the police department in Crowley, La., arrested Theresa Richard for allegedly recording him in public. The site features the video that landed Richard in trouble with the law.Some good news, however, came in another case late last month. A federal appellate court in Gericke vs. Begin considered the situation of a New Hampshire woman, Carla Gericke, who was arrested and initially charged with violating the Granite State's wiretapping statute after she attempted to film (her video camera ultimately failed to work) a late-night traffic stop of a friend in the town of Weare. Although prosecutors decided not to move forward with the charge, Gericke sued, claiming ""the officers violated her First Amendment rights when they charged her with illegal wiretapping in retaliation for her videotaping of the traffic stop.""  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held on May 23 there is, indeed, a First Amendment right to record a traffic stop, although that right is not unlimited. The appellate court reasoned thatthe circumstances of some traffic stops, particularly when the detained individual is armed, might justify a safety measure . . . that would incidentally impact an individual's exercise of the First Amendment right to film. Such an order, even when directed at a person who is filming, may be appropriate for legitimate safety reasons. However, a police order that is specifically directed at the First Amendment right to film police performing their duties in public may be constitutionally imposed only if the officer can reasonably conclude that the filming itself is interfering, or is about to interfere, with his duties.The decision in Gericke builds on a 2011 opinion by the First Circuit in Glik vs. Cunniffe. That case involved the arrest of Simon Glik for using ""his cell phone's digital video camera to film several police officers arresting a young man on the Boston Common."" The court in Glik ruled that ""the First Amendment protects the filming of government officials in public spaces."" Importantly, the decision does not just apply to professional journalists, but to all citizens.That is why these cases are so important. Today, anyone and everyone has the capacity to be a journalist and to record with their smartphones potential abuses of government authority. One need only recall the video footage captured by George Holliday in 1991 of Los Angeles police officers beating Rodney King to understand this reality. The court in Glik observed thatchanges in technology and society have made the lines between private citizen and journalist exceedingly difficult to draw. The proliferation of electronic devices with video-recording capability means that many of our images of current events come from bystanders with a ready cell phone or digital camera rather than a traditional film crew, and news stories are now just as likely to be broken by a blogger at her computer as a reporter at a major newspaper. As for Carla Gericke, her case isn't over. The New Hampshire Union Leader reported that it returns to the trial court to determine if her rights were, in fact, violated or if the officers were justified under the particular circumstances of her case. That will depend on whose version of the facts a jury believes. As Charles P. Bauer, the attorney for the Weare Police Department, put it, ""There's another side of the story."" How this plays out remains to be seen. For now, filming the police in public places remains a risky First Amendment proposition."
