All things food and drink",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/believe-it-or-not-these-c_us_5b9d8bc2e4b03a1dcc895e8b,Unexpected celebrities that own franchises of well-known chains.,2013-09-26,2013-09-25-9shaqHelgaEstebshutterstock.com_Flickr_venus201_day.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-25-9shaqHelgaEstebshutterstock.com_Flickr_venus201_day.jpg,"At this point in the celebrity machine, you can't go two feet without running into some sort of a celebrity endorsement deal. Everyone who's even remotely famous seems to have a clothing line, a perfume, a reality show, or something weird like a car endorsement (remember when J Lo endorsed Fiat ?). But when they aren't busy promoting themselves or the latest product to bear their name or likeness, sometimes celebrities and sports stars decide to open a restaurant or buy some locations of a well-known chain. We've already rounded up the best restaurants that are owned by celebrities, and here we'll take a look at some unexpected celebrities that own franchises of well-known chains. Photo Credit: Helga Esteb/ shutterstock.com Photo Credit: Â© Flickr /venus201 day Click Here to see all 10 Celebrities Who Own Chain RestaurantsThere are plenty of examples of celebrity-owned restaurants that have failed. See: Nyla by Britney Spears, Madre's by Jennifer Lopez, and eight other notorious examples that can be found here. Classic cases of opening a demanding business without the required experience, many celebrity-run restaurants are best remembered as the butt of jokes. But instead of going all-in and creating an entirely new restaurant concept, many celebrities who want to dip their toes into the restaurant game actually resort to purchasing franchises of already well-known brands, which come pre-packaged with two of the most important keys to success already built in: a widely known brand name and a pre-determined menu. Everyone from actors to singers to pro-athletes is getting in on the newest way to make a buck in the food game.Click Here to see 25 Best Celebrity-Owned RestaurantsSome of you might be familiar with Rick Ross and his Wingstop obsession. The lyric ""She thinking Phillipe's, I'm thinking Wing Stop"" even made its way into his jam ""MC Hammer."" So it shouldn't come as any surprise that he indulged and purchased some franchises of the wing chain. And before reconciling with her now-husband, reality star NeNe Leakes of the Real Housewives of Atlanta was romantically linked to John Kolaj, owner of Famous Famiglia Pizzeria. Insisting Kolaj was just her ""business partner,"" Leakes snapped up a franchise of the pizza chain in California. So if it wasn't true then... it is now. And these two are just the tip of the iceberg.- Rosemary Pantaleo, The Daily MealMore Content from The Daily Meal: Click Here to see 25 Best Celebrity-Owned Restaurants Click Here to see our 50 Best Cookie Recipes Click Here to see The 50 Best Burger Recipes Click Here to see 10 Celebrity-Owned Restaurant Fails"

The first first lady to pose for a Vogue cover, Hillary was no easy sell. In a new interview with Haute Living, Oscar explains:""I was able to convince Anna to put her on the cover. I did a lot to define to the viewer who Hillary actually is. [The cover shot] was taken when she was still in the White House. I do remember at the time her advisers weren't sure if it was the right thing to do, but in the end, she said, 'Oscar, you have a great instinct about me. Let's do it.'""And aren't we glad she did. Hillary's glossy turn paved the way for first ladies to follow (surely Michelle Obama thanks her) and helped to forge a friendship with Anna Wintour, too.

Last year, the retailer went head-to-toe Disney. This year, Barneys is going home for Christmas with... Jay Z?Yep, the luxury store is moving in a new direction for its annual holiday campaign. Women's Wear Daily reports that Barneys is partnering with Jay Z for ""A New York Holiday,"" a Christmastime promotion that will include limited-edition products by designers such as Lanvin, Balenciaga, Balmain, Rick Owens and Proenza Schouler. 25 percent of sales from the collection will go to Jay's Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation.All the designers worked with Jay Z on the items, making it Hova's first real foray into the fashion world. The collection includes a wide array of items, most of which are high-end, like a leather backpack, an alligator-strap watch, a cashmere blanket and a cotton t-shirt. Prices range from $70 to $33,900 for that fancy timepiece.Barneys will release the collection online and in store windows on November 20. Here's hoping the offerings receive more praise than those in friend and fellow throne-watcher Kanye West's high-end designer collaboration with A.P.C. And if it doesn't? Well, it will probably still sell -- just look how quickly Yeezy's $280 sweatshirts sold out.Learn more about ""A New York Holiday"" and see images of the collection at WWD.We love us a good collab:Want more?
