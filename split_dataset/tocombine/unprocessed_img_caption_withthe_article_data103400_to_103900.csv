0,BUSINESS,4 Strategies NASA Used to Market the Moon,"Markus Giesler, ContributorBusiness Professor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marketing-the-moon-a-four_b_6230314.html,"Most people look at NASA as a space agency and at my childhood projects as natural activities. However, NASA is probably one of the most successful marketing agencies in the 20th century and my childhood is evidence of its enduring influence on society.",2014-12-01,2014-11-27-Kennedy_Giving_Historic_Speech_to_Congress__GPN2000001658.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-27-Kennedy_Giving_Historic_Speech_to_Congress__GPN2000001658-thumb.jpg,"Becoming an astronaut was my biggest childhood dream. Who wrote it for me?Like most kids, I wanted to be an astronaut. To compensate for geographical distance to Cape Canaveral (I grew up in small-town Germany), my best friend and I designed Apollo mission shirts, erected a replica of 2001's famous monolith on our front lawn, transformed our door bell into a Hal 9000 front panel, and built a space observatory on the roof of our house.Most people look at NASA as a space agency and at my childhood projects as natural activities. However, NASA is probably one of the most successful marketing agencies in the 20th century and my childhood is evidence of its enduring influence on society and individual biographies. Long before Steve Jobs did his meticulously planned product launches, NASA managed to enrol millions of people in one of the biggest science education projects known to man. And whereas Steve Jobs would get hung up on tiny little iPhones, NASA had a really bold innovation in stock: the Moon. So how did NASA market the Moon? David Meerman Scott and Richard Jurek provide some fascinating clues in their book Marketing the Moon (2014). In the following, I add some of my own thoughts to offer a four-step model (based on an analysis of the rise of Botox Cosmetic).ProblematizationFirst of all, marketing the Moon required a larger political imperative. If the Moon was to be a solution to strive for collectively, as a nation, what on Earth was the problem? The Moon, a piece of rock, had to be made an obligatory passage point in winning a more existential struggle between forces of good and evil -- or the free world and communism. In cases where innovators have created a solution that is looking for a problem, marketers call this strategy problematization -- defining a problem that has the potential to advance the focal actor's economic or political goals.InteressementJust claiming that the Moon is an object of political interest was not enough, however. The Moon had to also be made an object of scientific interest. Unfortunately, most scientists before 1961 regarded the Moon as a pretty trivial object. Now NASA had to persuade them, through grants and scholarships, to redirect their research interests and agendas away from whatever they were working on and instead embrace the Moon. Likewise, citizens needed to be made to fall in love with rocket science, physics, astronomy, geology, and engineering. These disciplines could not only lend legitimacy to the project far beyond the political level. They also helped raise interest for other critical non-human actors such as the space suit, the oxygen tank, or the Moon rock.EnrollmentSituating the Moon within a larger political struggle and making the quest a science project had given new meanings to the Moon, science, technology, and the nation as a whole. But in order to captivate regular people, more work had to be done. The Moon had to be pushed into the American living room. Sociologically speaking, the emerging assemblage had to be translated into the everyday, and the media was the key to accomplishing this goal. Along these lines, NASA created a host of PR materials, fully-produced radio newscasts, interview reels, and brochures. PR people began to downplay rocket scientist Wernher von Braun's dark Nazi past and instead played him up as a grandfatherly storyteller. The astronauts, their wives, their children, and even their pets were enlisted as media personalities, bringing the Moon ever closer into the American home. These personalities not only gave the Moon a human face. They also translated the complexity of a Moon mission into an easily consumable way of being American: creative, curious, scientific, hardworking, and boldly reaching for the stars. Marketers call this strategy enrollment -- creating a network of representatives that translate the focal product into concrete, everyday social roles.MobilizationLastly, citizens had to take their ascribed roles. For most of them, it meant turning on the TV at the right time and watching the action unfold. For me and millions of other kids born after 1961, it meant taking their seats on the roof of their parents' house at night to watch the Moon with their telescopes. For most of my life, I looked at these events as moments of freedom and autonomy. It took me a while to realize that this was exactly the place where Marketing Mission Control wanted me to be.So what has NASA really done? Putting a man on the Moon is certainly impressive. But the real accomplishment took place here on Earth. NASA has reshaped politics, science, technology, America, the family, and my childhood. It has created an enormous amount of new meanings, styles, associations, and fantasy worlds that live on in Daft Punk videos, Hollywood movies, and Elon Musk's rocket engineering projects. From a more critical perspective, however, it has also created several generations of citizens with a Moon fetish -- folks who looked to the Moon and the stars, thereby neglecting to look at each other."

The march, organized by the NAACP to evoke civil rights marches from the 1960s, began Saturday afternoon on Canfield Drive in Ferguson where Michael Brown was killed and is expected to last seven days. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dee425000094003a56f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ferguson, Missouri is about a four-hour drive east from where I live in Lawrence, Kansas, yet it seems a world apart. In my town, which is far more white than Ferguson, there's no news reports of riots, burning drug stores, people shaken and weeping from tear gas thrown at them, or the hometown agony of what happens when a police officer kills a teenager for what's commonly summed up as ""acting out."" Like much of America, it might be easy to think Ferguson is someplace else, part of another, more broken country.That's the thing about privilege: it's invisible. When I hear from friends of color that they often face discrimination, that -- according to one friend on Facebook, ""it's just another day in America"" -- part of me is always surprised because as a white person, I don't see racism on a daily, weekly or even occasional basis. Part of me is never surprised because I do hear about racism regularly when I read statistics about how men of color disproportionately fill our prisons, when friends tell about being pulled off ""for driving while Black,"" and when people tell me their stories, which aren't about the occasional inconvenience of racism, but the enduring pain.""You have idea how hard it is being Indian in this town,"" a Navajo friend told me years ago. She went on to say how the police regularly pulled her over, a mother of three, to check her license and registration, and some store owners watched her carefully when she perused the silk shirts. I wrongly assumed that because we had the largest inter-tribal university in Lawrence, native people would feel more at home here, but this friend was only the first of many who told me otherwise. ""It's a daily thing,"" another friend said. Sometimes it was subtle, just an eyebrow raised or head turned away, but it was often daily.I had no idea, not because I don't care or look away, but because it's not something running through the screen of what I see each day. Sure, I experience sexism on occasion. Yes, I've run head-on into anti-Semitism, but never in ways that put me in direct danger. In a land where race and class play big time in the suffering of human kind, as a middle-class white woman, I have an abundantly easy ride. Not so for my Latino, Native American, African-American and other friends of color. Not so for my friends with children of color, who carry the immense weight of educating their sons to appear as non-threatening as possible.It is easy and outrageously common at the moment for people to jump into the Mike Brown killing and Ferguson riots with justifications, one-dimensional analysis, and lots of detailed scenario-playing. I've read reports and listened to people, for the most part white people, explain how, although Brown didn't ""have it coming,"" he acted foolishly, and Darren Wilson, although impulsive, acted in self-defense; that we shouldn't jump to conclusions about racism; that there's also black-cop on white-teenager abuse and black-on-black crime. All of this reasoning seems bent on 1) Not understanding the power dynamics of having privilege and not having privilege; 2) Not understanding what it is to be Black or Latino or Native or otherwise not-white in much of America; and 3) Not understanding that what lit the fuse here is the systematic fire, that this incident follows so many others, not the least of which is Trayvon Martin, another Black teenager, and this one not ""acting out"" in any way.While it's fine for white people like me to have our opinions, we are composing our opinions from a place of blindness. Most of us (especially if we're not married to or parenting people of color) don't get to see everyday what it is to be looked at with suspicion, judged by the color of our skin, expected to fail, or held to a higher standard. I've heard many white people say, ""Well, I just treat everyone equally and with respect,"" which is great and what the best in us should always strive for, but at the same time, those of us saying this often don't acknowledge there's far more to the picture.So what can a white person do? Ask questions. Listen. Open up our perception more to try to see what it's like more to not have such privilege. Lean into the story behind the story. Wait for our friends and acquaintances of color to trust us enough. Learn what's happening that fuels such anguish, such rage, such widespread feelings of powerlessness. Ask, when we're in a room or meeting or community that's mostly or all white, why that is. Start at the beginning of plans for events, readings, conferences, happenings to involve people of color who might otherwise be overlooked. Reach out of our comfort zones. Be scared and confused about what to do, but grapple with opening our hearts more to understand what life, in its minutiae, is like for people of color in our workplaces, groups, communities. Most of all, understand that we can't know in a constant and visceral way what it is to be a person of color in America. My town, and perhaps yours too, may seem far from the fires and anguish, but that distance is illusion. Ferguson is part of the broken heart of this country where we live, no matter where and how we live. How to heal this broken heart? Remember that what's torn in our country is torn in us too. Begin the process of mending."

And third, #GivingTuesday.Here's the official definition:On Tuesday, December 2, 2014, charities, families, businesses, community centers, and students around the world will come together for one common purpose: to celebrate generosity and to give. It's a simple idea. Just find a way for your family, your community, your company or your organization to come together to give something more.I like the idea that conspicuous consumption can give way to conspicuous compassion. So, with hopes it may inspire some readers, I'd like to share a true story that exemplifies the idea of giving while living. Julius Rosenwald was a co-founder of Sears, Roebuck & Company. He created a foundation with his wealth and stipulated that all the funds be spent within 25 years of his death; the Foundation closed in 1948, having granted $63 million.Mr. Rosenwald founded Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. He endowed the Tuskegee Institute and served on its board for 20 years, working closely with Booker T. Washington. In the American South, he showed innovation by using $4 million as matching funds to support the building of more than 5,300 schools and teachers' homes.But while his contemporaries Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller were building foundations that would limit giving to establish endowments in perpetuity, Mr. Rosenwald insisted that ""the generation which has contributed to the making of a millionaire should be the one to profit by his generosity."" A sense of pressing immediate needs also drove his decision to reject the perpetuity model. He expressed his philosophy this way: Permanent endowment tends to lessen the amount available for immediate needs; and our immediate needs are too plain and too urgent to allow us to do the work of future generations.By 1932, a remarkable 35 percent of all black children in the South received an education in a Rosenwald school.Julius Rosenwald died that same year with the knowledge that his ""giving while living"" had made a significant difference to his own generation.

Respectability will never be a solution because the issue isn't us; it's how white America views blackness.",2014-11-30,"FERGUSON, MO - AUGUST 17: Demonstrators raise their arms and chant, 'Hands up, Don't Shoot', as police clear them from the street as they protest the shooting death of Michael Brown on August 17, 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. Police sprayed pepper spray, shot smoke, gas and flash grenades as violent outbreaks have taken place in Ferguson since the shooting death of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer on August 9th. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8df062000000f0201d5ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The answer to the question posed in this post's title is nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not one thing. Nada. Zip. Zero.  The ""Black-on-Black crime"" moniker is racist rhetoric functioning under the guise of concern for the state of Black America. People of all races -- Blacks included -- seemingly love to discuss how not killing our own and being more respectable will alleviate the effects of racism.  It's dangerous, however, to tell Black people to dress better, work harder or be respectable because it diverts attention from the gaze of the oppressor to the behavior of the disenfranchised. It showcases how deep anti-blackness runs within our society. This highly misinformed line of thinking negates the complex historical implications surrounding a white cop killing an unarmed Black teenager.Authority has a long history of not respecting Black people so why some folks think becoming more respectable will solve anything is confusing. Our respect means nothing to those who see no value in Black life. They don't care for or want our respect -- they want our compliance. They want our submission.""Black-on-Black crime"" highlights the fear surrounding Black masculinity, the lack of Black femininity, and perceived inherent Black criminality. And, when Black people are shamed for committing the same crimes at almost the same rates as whites, it illustrates how much the white supremacist gaze has been internalized.The term, which originated in the 1980s, cites Black people as a problem as opposed to poverty, poor educational opportunities, proximity and other factors that lead to increased crime rates within all communities -- regardless of color.  Research conducted by David Wilson explains how the media picked up on a new wave of violence within Black communities -- which was undoubtedly fueled by job loss, debased identity and ""rampant physical decay""-- and constructed the misperception that intraracial crime was a malady only plaguing Black America.  But racial exclusivity is apparent in the majority of violent crimes. Around 91 percent of Black victims are murdered by Black offenders while 83 percent of white victims are killed by another white person, based on the most recent FBI homicide statistics.  The ""Black-on-Black"" crime argument alludes that there's nothing normal about Black intraracial crime. ""White-on-white"" violence is simply called crime. Why is Black intraracial violence depicted as some rare Pokémon in crime discussions when it is only slightly more prevalent?  Flawed white perception is not assuaged is these talks -- Black behavior is, instead, attacked. This places Black folk in a ""Catch 22."" No matter how ""respectable"" we are or become, as long as our skin is Black we will never amount to white standards though we are expected to be a reflection of them.  Respectability will never be a solution because the issue isn't us; it's how white America views blackness.   Mike Brown's death, and the subsequent lack of justice, isn't about the myth of ""Black-on-Black crime."" It's about how Blacks are disproportionately, and often unjustly, targeted by law enforcement. It's about how systemic racism frames the way in which Black people, especially men, are viewed. It's about how Black corpses are criminalized and put on trial but their white killers often go unindicted.The circumstances surrounding Mike Brown's death represent a much larger racially oppressive government and police structure that excuses white killers but refuses to humanize black victims due to the inherent guilt attributed to black people and blackness.And when you tell Black people to be more respectable and not kill one another, you're identifying us as savage brutes who deserve to be gunned down due to this assumed lack of humanity.The protests in Ferguson do not show the supposed intrinsic animalistic nature of Black people. They showcase a community -- and reflect a nation of people -- tired of constantly being at the mercy of a justice system that sees no value in their livelihood.Ferguson is illustrating what happens when people are fed up with being targeted. Ferguson is spearheading a movement. Stop detracting from that with baseless ""Black-on-Black crime"" discussions."

They believe his case should again raise questions over the legality of executing the mentally ill: an issue the U.S. Supreme Court has previously considered. (AP Photo/Texas Department of Criminal Justice)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2be1f2200008300da70f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MICHAEL GRACZYK, Associated PressHUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) — No one disputes that Scott Panetti — heavily armed, head shaved and wearing camouflage — shot and killed his in-laws at their Texas Hill Country home, showering his estranged wife and 3-year-old daughter in blood.Panetti himself acknowledged during his 1995 capital murder trial that he had killed Joe and Amanda Alvarado. Dressed as a cowboy, he acted as his own attorney, believing only an insane person could prove an insanity defense.Jurors convicted him and sentenced him to death, and he is scheduled to die on Wednesday.Panetti's attorneys are seeking to get him off death row or, in the very least, to get his execution date postponed so that he can undergo further psychological testing to determine if he's competent to be put to death. They believe his case raises questions about the legality of executing the mentally ill — an issue the U.S. Supreme Court has previously considered.""From our perspective, this has been like a slow-moving train wreck since 1995,"" said Kathryn Kase, one of his lawyers.A diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, Panetti had been hospitalized for mental illness more than a dozen times in the decade leading up to the September 1992 killings of the Alvarados.A 2007 Supreme Court review of Panetti's case tweaked the criteria for executing those with severe mental disorders by requiring inmates to not only know that they are being punished, but to also have a ""rational understanding"" of their punishment. Providing little guidance other than requiring a ""fair hearing"" for presentation of psychiatric evidence to consider insanity claims, the justices returned Panetti's case to lower federal courts, which ultimately found him competent.Seven years since his last mental evaluation, Panetti is showing increasingly aberrant delusional behavior on death row, said Kase, who visited him a few weeks ago. He believes his punishment is part of a satanic conspiracy to prevent him from preaching the Gospel.""He cannot appreciate why Texas seeks to execute him,"" Kase said. ""You have to have a rational as well as factual understanding of why you're being executed.""In Mr. Panetti's case, his understanding is the state wants to prevent him from preaching the Gospel on death row and saving their souls.

It had the commendable purpose of raising money for scholarships to the University of Virginia.But not the kind of scholarships that go to low-income students based solely on their financial need. The proceeds from Mr. Jefferson’s Capital Ball are destined for merit aid for applicants who have the high grade-point averages and top scores on entrance tests that help institutions do well on college rankings. Merit aid can also attract middle- and upper-income students whose families can pay the rest of the tuition bill and therefore furnish badly needed revenue to colleges and universities. As institutions vie for income and prestige in this way, the net prices they’re charging the lowest-income students, after discounts and financial aid, continue to rise faster on average than the net prices they’re charging higher-income ones, according to an analysis of newly released data the universities and colleges are required to report to the U.S. Department of Education. This includes the 100 higher-education institutions whose leaders attended a widely publicized White House summit in January and promised to expand the opportunities for low-income students to go to college. In fact, the private universities in that group collectively raised what the poorest families pay by 10 percent, compared to 5 percent for wealthier students, according to the analysis by The Dallas Morning News and The Hechinger Report based on information the U.S. Department of Education released this month covering 2008-09 to 2012-13, the most recent period available.Not only did the White House pledge schools raise their net prices faster for the poorest than for higher-income families on a percentage basis, the new figures show; nearly a third increased the actual dollar amount more quickly for their lowest-income than their higher-income students.At the University of Virginia, for instance, the poorest students saw their net price climb $4,313 over that period, compared to $2,687 for students in the top earning bracket.“Institutions need to remain vigilant in making sure that the students with the highest need have the highest access to aid,” U.S. Under Secretary of Education Ted Mitchell said when asked about the disparity between the promises made by institutions and their real-world performance. The White House has scheduled a follow-up summit for Thursday on the issue of keeping college affordable for the lowest-income students. At the first summit, UVA President Teresa Sullivan was among the leaders who pledged to help poor families afford the price of college. From the start of the economic downturn through 2013, however, UVA raised the net price for its very poorest students by 69 percent, more than three times faster than for wealthier students, whose tuition increased 21 percent, the federal figures show. And even since January, beginning with the class that entered this fall, the public university dropped a policy of meeting full need for the lowest-income students without requiring them to take out loans and now asks in-state families to borrow up to $14,000 over four years and out-of-state families up to $28,000.“All too many elite, extremely wealthy colleges and universities that should be operating as engines of socioeconomic mobility are instead calcifying inequality,” said Michael Dannenberg, director of higher education at the nonpartisan think tank The Education Trust. What’s “Net Price”?Colleges are required to annually report their average net prices—the total cost of tuition, fees, room, board, books, and other expenses, minus federal, state, and institutional scholarships and grants -- to the Education Department. They must also break down those prices based on students’ family income, from the lowest -- $30,000 or less -- to the highest -- $110,000 or more.There are limitations to the data. They cover only full-time freshmen who get federal grants, loans, or work-study jobs. The most recent figures cover the period ending more than a year before that January White House summit. And some schools dispute how net price should be determined and use their own calculations that are different from the federal formula.But the figures give the only available picture of what students from different income brackets pay to study at the same university or college. The data also make clear that, while lower-income students at many of the institutions represented at the White House summit still pay less than higher-income ones, their net prices are rising faster on an inflation-adjusted percentage basis than the net prices charged to students more able to pay. In some cases, costs for the wealthier families are actually falling.Even at the 36 taxpayer-supported public universities that signed the White House pledge, poor students paid an average net price of about $8,000 in 2008-09 and almost $10,000 in 2012-13. That’s a 25 percent increase. During the same period, wealthier students at those schools saw their average net price go from about $18,000 to $21,000, a 16 percent increase. The figures have been adjusted for inflation.Universities “are giving lots of merit aid to kids who don’t need it,” and less financial aid to those who do, said Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tank The Century Foundation.In fact, Kahlenberg said, “There are powerful incentives for universities to avoid admitting and enrolling low-income students. The way that universities compete is on prestige and on the U.S.News & World Report rankings, and you get no credit for having a generous financial aid program that brings in more low-income students.” Colleges RespondA UVA spokesman stressed that Mr. Jefferson’s Capital Ball is run by an independent foundation of alumni and other supporters, not by the university itself. He also said the elimination of the no-loan policy for low-income students was unavoidable because the cost of assisting them exclusively with grants had nearly doubled since 2008. Requiring all students to borrow is projected to save the university more than $10 million through 2018.“UVA has committed to providing the necessary need but also needs to ensure that the program is sustainable,” the spokesman, McGregor McCance, said.Heated protests over the changes, however, brought attention to the fact that, even as it was cutting the cost of providing financial aid to its poorest students, UVA was spending $12 million on a new squash facility and increasing its marketing budget by $18 million annually. Since then, a member of the Board of Visitors, Blue Ridge Capital president John Griffin, has pledged $4 million for scholarships for high-achieving low-income students and to seed an endowment for financial aid for top low-income undergraduates. A few other universities and colleges that were represented at the White House “Improving College Opportunity” summit said their net prices for low-income students appeared to be increasing more quickly than they really have because they use different formulas than the federal government does to calculate whether or not a student has financial need.For example, while the government takes into account only the income of the custodial parent in the case of a divorce, these colleges also factor in the income of the parent who does not live at home, and often the value of real estate and other holdings. This means they do not necessarily regard as low income the same students the federal government does, and may not provide them with much financial aid.That’s one reason Claremont McKenna College said it appeared to have more than doubled its net price for its poorest students -- 10 times as fast as for their richer classmates -- in spite of also signing the White House pledge, spokesman Max Benavidez said.“Moving from one formula in reporting aid to another completely different methodological formula may account for the misimpression of a large increase,” Benavidez said, though he would not provide the formula the college uses. Another White House-pledge college that uses its own formula to calculate need, Oberlin, did provide specifics. While federal figures show it doubled the net price for its poorest students at a rate 10 times as fast as for the highest group, Oberlin’s own calculations -- which include the earnings of both parents in cases of divorce, making fewer students qualify as low income than the federal method—show that the net price for the poorest students hardly budged in the last three years and fell in 2012-13, said Debra Chermonte, dean of admissions and financial aid.Nor are seemingly wealthier families always necessarily able to afford tuition without help. Some may live in places with high costs of living, leaving them less disposable income, or have children close in age who go to college at the same time.“You might be making $200,000 a year, but you just got divorced and that’s a factor and this is a factor and there are other factors,” said Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University.Another president, Patrick Leahy of Wilkes University, said, “There’s plenty of aid going to the $80,000 [earners] and below, but once you get to $80,000 it’s not like it’s some magic number and you can suddenly afford tuition.” Other universities and colleges at which the net price for low-income students has shot up faster than for higher-income ones conceded that financial aid based on merit, as opposed to need, is increasingly important to their bottom lines.“Tuition-driven schools like UVM must think holistically about the entire undergraduate population and use more merit aid than in the past,” said Enrique Corredera, spokesman for the public University of Vermont, another school that signed the White House pledge but has more than doubled the net price for its poorest students, from $4,500 in 2008-09 to $11,000 in 2012-13. Meanwhile, the net price for students in top income group stayed flat at $21,000 a year. “We do this to attract academically talented students, who play a significant role in determining our ability to attract other students.” Corredera said wealthier students, whose families can afford to pay at least some of the tuition, also subsidize financial aid for their poorer classmates. That subsidy is under attack in some states. The board of governors of North Carolina’s public universities, for example, is considering capping the proportion of tuition revenue that could be applied toward financial aid for low-income students, arguing that more affluent students shouldn’t be forced to cover the costs of their less affluent classmates. Iowa has already stopped its universities from using any of their in-state residents’ tuition toward financial aid.Cuts in state allocations for higher education have also reduced the money available for financial aid for low-income students, said some other public universities, including the University of Arkansas. “People who come from at-risk families are just as smart, just as talented as anyone else, and should have the same opportunities,” the university’s chancellor, G. David Gearhart, said at the time that he, too, signed the White House pledge. “A flagship, land-grant university should take this responsibility. It’s a big obligation but it’s one that is part of our heritage.”Yet the University of Arkansas raised its net price for the poorest families by 9 percent while lowering it 6 percent for wealthier ones between 2008-09 and 2012-13. The lopsided changes in cost there came even before the Arkansas State Lottery Scholarship was cut last year by more than 50 percent, said university spokeswoman Laura Jacobs, threatening to reduce even more funding reserved for low-income students.“There’s a glaring lack of political leadership around this in the states,” said Michael McLendon, professor of higher-education policy at Southern Methodist University. Rather than in need-based financial aid, McLendon said, “It’s politically popular to invest a lot of state money in merit-based aid. It’s very appealing to the middle class.” But, he said, “It’s not helpful for boosting higher-education access or completion for the poorest kids.”There’s at least one glimmer of promise for critics of current aid practices. As the heat on this matter is being turned up, states, on average, slightly increased the share of financial aid they allocated for low-income students, as opposed to other students, in 2012-13, the latest year for which that figure is available, according to the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs. On the other hand, the inflation-adjusted total amount of aid declined.This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, nonpartisan education-news outlet affiliated with Teachers College, Columbia University, in collaboration with the Dallas Morning News and the Education Writers Association.

12,SPORTS,Sport and Society for Arete: Rice and Goodell,"Richard Crepeau, ContributorHistory Professor, University of Central Florida",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sport-and-society-for-are_b_6242092.html,For those who wonder why the owners have supported Goodell through the recent missteps and blunders it is only necessary to look at what the labor settlement and television contracts have done to team values. A lot of money has been delivered to the owners by Roger Goodell's achievements.,2014-11-30,"NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 08: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell holds a press conference on October 8, 2014 in New York City. Goodell addressed the media at the conclusion of the annual Fall league meeting in the wake of a string of high-profile incidents, including the domestic violence case of Ray Rice. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb775943c000018010d8e02.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How surprising was it when the arbitrator in the Ray Rice case ruled that Roger Goodell had acted ""arbitrary in his discretion,"" and had punished Rice twice for the same offense? In addition when Goodell claimed that Ray Rice misled him about the severity of the incident, the arbitrator found otherwise. Goodell was fully apprised by Rice as to the severity of the incident. A football term comes to mind, as this was not the first ""fumble"" of Goodell's tenure as Commissioner. The list, in fact, is growing. It should not be surprising that for someone whose primary mission as Commissioner is to ""Protect the Shield,"" that his compass spins with the shifting and swirling winds in public opinion. This is particularly true when that same person is a self-appointed guardian of standards of conduct, when those standards are not clear, and when the guardian seems to be making those standards up with each shift in the winds. The first conduct case came in Goodell's first year as Commissioner when the New England Patriots were found spying on their opponents. Goodell put the hammer down, or so it seemed to some, fining the Patriots $250,000, taking away a first round draft pick, and fining Coach Belechick $500,000. Goodell than destroyed the tapes before any other questions could be asked about the extent of this practice in New England and across the NFL. Also in Goodell's first year three dozen players were arrested for assorted offenses and that led the Commissioner to announce that he was strengthening the league conduct policy to allow him to discipline teams, players, and league and team personnel. A not guilty verdict in a courtroom was not good enough, he declared, as NFL personnel would be held to a higher standard. It was nearly perfect PR.Next came the Michael Vick dog-fighting case and here the Commissioner moved cautiously allowing the court cases to move to conclusion before suspending Vick. After serving time in prison Vick sought reinstatement in the NFL and again Goodell acted with caution and reinstated Vick. Public fallout was minimal.In 2010, Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was charged with sexual assault of a twenty-one year old female college student in a bar in Milledgeville, Georgia. Throughout the course of the case Goodell kept a very low profile. Jemele Hill of ESPN accused Goodell of racism pointing out that in several cases involving African-American players over the previous five years Goodell had quickly issued suspensions before criminal investigations were completed. When a suspension for six games came many felt the penalty was too soft especially after it was reduced to four games. Whatever the misgivings a 2009 player poll by Sports Illustrated and CNN gave the Commissioner high marks. Two months later the owners rewarded Goodell with a five year extension on his contract. Owners cited Goodell's ""already significant list of accomplishments"" and ""his strategic vision for the future of our league.""The NFL was experiencing record attendance and television ratings were moving steadily upward. Two more major achievements followed. Goodell guided the league through a very difficult labor negotiation that produced a long term Collective Bargaining Agreement guaranteeing labor peace for ten years. With the CBA in place Goodell moved on to new television contracts that reached astounding levels, something that the guarantee of labor peace facilitated. For those who wonder why the owners have supported Goodell through the recent missteps and blunders it is only necessary to look at what the labor settlement and television contracts have done to team values. A lot of money has been delivered to the owners by Roger Goodell's achievements. At the same time the Commissioner's record was already quite troubling on the concussion issue. Goodell continued the mantra of denial at every step along the way. It was a shabby performance and at one point in a public hearing Representative Linda Sanchez told Goodell that his attitude before the House committee reminded her of that of the tobacco industry as it repeatedly denied any linkage between tobacco and health. Goodell's silence was telling. As the lawsuits mounted and public discussion increased, the NFL and the Commissioner found it useful to modify their stance and to seek legal settlement in the courts. As the concussion issue grew in the public eye, the New Orleans Saints were implicated in a bounty scandal in which players were given cash incentives to injure opposing players. Goodell moved quickly when he received the report on bounties and handed down heavy punishments and fines to players, coaches, and the team. Appeals followed and in the end Goodell was overruled by his predecessor, former Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who serving as arbitrator reduced the penalties and then tried to cover Goodell by saying that the Commissioner had acted within his authority. What was clear in the public eye was that Goodell had made a mistake, and he was being publicly reprimanded for it. Another public relations gaff hit the league when the referees were locked out at the opening of the season in 2012. This quickly turned into a fiasco as the league used scab referees who demonstrated their inadequacies on national television as Goodell pretended that all was well. A Commissioner who worried about the integrity of the League would never have gotten into this mess. Fans would tolerate a lot, but not the total disregard for the game on the field. Then came the Rice Case which has been a disaster for Goodell and his Shield Protection strategies. Add to it the Adrian Pederson case and more missteps and hesitations further damaged the Commissioner's image. If in the end the ""independent"" investigator finds that Roger Goodell lied about when he saw the Ray Rice video, Goodell will most certainly have to go. He probably should already be gone, and would be of his own volition if he is really interested in Protecting the Shield. In the end, the owners will make the decision on the Commissioner's fate. He has served them well and increased their incomes. Treating players unfairly has never been a crime in the eyes of most owners and so Goodell may survive, but the Shield will never be quite the same.On Sport and Society this is Dick Crepeau reminding you that you don't have to be a good sport to be a bad loser.Copyright 2014 by Richard C.

(Photo by Douglas Burrows/Liaison)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8df022200005700dd7eab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In August 1992, nearly three months to the day after the four LAPD officers that beat black motorist Rodney King were acquitted on nearly all charges by a jury with no blacks on it, Lourdes G. Baird, the United States Attorney for California's Central District, stepped before a battery of news cameras and reporters and announced that three of the officers would face federal charges. The charges were violating King's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable arrest and with depriving him of his 14th Amendment due-process rights during his March, 1991 arrest. The four would face up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted. The Justice Department's decision to prosecute rested squarely on two compelling legal and public interest points, neither of which significantly involved any need to proof racial animus. The legal charges were that the officers who beat King acted under the color of the law. This violated a near century old federal statute that makes it a crime to deprive any person of a Constitutional right under the color of law. The statute specifically targeted police officers and public officials who abuse their authority and violate public trust by physically victimizing citizens. The Justice Department assigned more than a dozen agents to the case, and a team of civil rights attorneys and investigators. It repeatedly fended off loud criticisms that the prosecution was a racial witch hunt to satisfy the clamor from civil rights organizations and a sop to African-Americans who blasted their acquittal in state court. This charge was continually leveled at then President George H.W. Bush who green-lighted the federal prosecution. He was accused of caving in to the threat of more bloody riots if he didn't act.There would have been absolutely no chance to bring, let alone get, convictions of the officers if there had been even the remotest public hint that race was the sole reason for the federal prosecution. The Justice Department had to bring, argue and try to win their convictions exclusively on the evidence and testimony that the cops violated the federal statutes in beating King. Baird reiterated the point: ""Racial motivation is not an element of any of these charges."" Twenty-two years later, the situation with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson is nearly identical. The instant the call went up for a federal investigation and prosecution of Wilson on civil rights charges in the slaying of Michael Brown, the same loud scream was heard that Wilson broke no law, acted under color of authority, and that any federal action against him was done solely to appease civil rights organizations that clamored for his head. The Ferguson grand jury decision not to indict him brought the same outcry that the state trial and acquittal of the four LAPD cops who beat King brought, namely that there are no grounds for a separate federal action against him. Federal prosecutors in the King case knocked that down when they made clear that the jury decision did not satisfy the federal requirement for the presentation of fair, unbiased evidence and witness testimony in a publicly charged trial. The same argument stands with the Ferguson grand jury. The gaping holes, inconsistencies, contradictions and omission in and of the testimony and evidence presented to the grand jury, as well as the dismissal of witness testimony that would have rebutted Wilson's story, was ignored. This violated the fundamental precept of how a grand jury is supposed to function. Even U.S. Supreme Court Antonin Scalia, the hardest of hard-nosed in defending absolute police power, noted that it is the grand jury's function not ""to enquire ... upon what foundation [the charge may be] denied,"" or otherwise to try the suspect's defenses, but only to examine ""upon what foundation [the charge] is made"" by the prosecutor. Scalia made one more another crucial point that debunks any notion the Ferguson proceeding was fair. This was the four-hour guided testimony of Wilson. Scalia noted that ""neither in this country nor in England has the suspect under investigation by the grand jury ever been thought to have a right to testify or to have exculpatory evidence presented. ""Brown as was King was unarmed. Brown and King were not charged with a crime when detained. Brown as King received injuries after he ceased resisting. Brown as King was abused during an official stop. These, as they were with King, are compelling civil rights violations.Associate Attorney General Wayne Budd, who directed the federal investigation into the King beating case, issued this terse statement after the indictment of the LAPD cops was announced ""The Department of Justice has a responsibility to vindicate the violation of the fundamental rights protected by the United States Constitution."" The indictment he said was the first step toward fulfilling that responsibility.The Justice Department should take the same step in the Brown slaying it took 22 years ago in the King beating case.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dedf1f00002501257772.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Republicans emerged from the midterm elections with a Senate majority and their strongest House majority since Herbert Hoover's presidency in part due to voters' economic discontent. According to exit polls, the economy was the top issue on voters' minds. During the campaign, Republican leaders doggedly promoted the idea that the GOP was the party to turn it around, often touting a list of 46 ""jobs bills"" that have passed in the House.Yet all that legislation may actually be more of a public relations stunt than a solid strategy to boost employment, according to economists interviewed by The Huffington Post.House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) hinted as much -- unintentionally -- in a classic Twitter fail in October.The blank list was roundly mocked online. Nonetheless, Boehner and other Republicans trotted out their compendium repeatedly during the campaign, asserting that their legislation would already have created jobs if only the Democratic Senate and President Barack Obama had supported the bills. (They made that claim in part by ignoring the fact that six of the bills had been endorsed or signed by the president.)Republicans ranging from national leaders like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to Senate hopefuls like Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) lauded Boehner's legislation. ""We've had 40 bills on job creation, things like opening up our energy for American jobs, Keystone pipeline, reducing tax rates, balancing the budget -- all dying over [there in] the United States Senate,"" Ryan said on ""The Sean Hannity Show"" in August. But that message rang hollow for the five economists who reviewed the bills for HuffPost.Almost none of those measures, the economists said, are likely to have the measurable, immediate impact on job growth that Boehner claimed his party would have delivered. Instead, the bills would serve more to promote other parts of the Republicans' agenda -- and, in most cases, aid large corporations. Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said he was unimpressed with the economists' findings. “Notwithstanding cherry-picked ‘expert’ opinions, the American people understand that expanding the supply of domestic energy, reducing regulations, improving education, and cutting wasteful spending will help our economy grow and create jobs,” Steel said in an email.The GOP has already begun pushing some of these favored measures in the Senate, though Democrats still control that chamber. A Keystone pipeline bill failed a Senate vote in November. The House's proposed Jobs for America Act is now on the Senate calendar. Tax cuts in that bill worth some $444 billion could get separate consideration this week.With the start of the next Congress only about a month away, many of these GOP bills are sure to make a comeback. Below, read the economists' takes on what the legislation would really do, and browse through the slideshow detailing all of the bills at the end of the story.Energy And Environment BillsThe largest number of bills are aimed at deregulating the energy sector. Republicans claim this would promote job creation by saving companies a lot of money they now spend complying with federal rules.""It's sort of a classic argument,"" said Barry Rabe, a University of Michigan public policy professor who specializes in environmental policy. But he said it's difficult to measure the economic impact, if any, these bills would have in the short term -- the period in which Americans are looking for more jobs.Rabe added that he thinks the bills are more a symbolic response to what Republicans view as Obama's overstepping his powers.For instance, some of the measures attempt to block Obama's environmental goals, which the president plans to pursue further through executive action. The Energy Consumers Relief Act would bar the Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing new emissions standards for power plants. In a similar vein, the Electricity Security and Affordability Act would require the EPA to seek congressional approval for establishing these emissions rules.""It's very hard to know [the economic impact of such legislation], especially if you take the case of the clean power plants,"" Rabe said. ""We're talking about transitions for 2020 and even 2030. So it's really hard to even begin to estimate what impacts these would have, and because the EPA plan gives [the states] so many different ways to potentially comply, it's hard to know what the jobs impacts are going to be."" He noted that bills restricting the EPA's power would work hand-in-hand with other pieces of legislation on Boehner's list that would grant states the power to override federal regulation. These are ""parallel steps by Republicans in Congress and Republicans in state government to find ways to take apart what the president is trying to do on climate change,"" Rabe said.A few of these bills could result in short-term economic gains, according to Rabe. For example, the Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act and the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act would accelerate oil and natural gas drilling. However, Rabe said, they could only lead to job creation if they also included provisions that would help to increase exports and keep prices high. Such provisions are not present in the current set of bills, he said.Tax Cut BillsSeveral of the ""jobs bills"" would institute tax cuts across a range of policy areas. While these measures would, like environmental deregulation, leave more cash in the hands of businesses and households, they are not guaranteed to create jobs, either. One example is the American Research and Competitiveness Act, passed by the House in May, which would make permanent a tax cut for firms that invest in research and development. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), and a number of pro-business groups have touted it as a job creator.But Gary Burtless, an economist who studies tax policy at the Brookings Institution, said that lightening the tax burden on companies that do research and development would not guarantee that they would hire more Americans.“We’d certainly like to think so, but the example of Apple, Dell, Intel, lots and lots of other firms, is that many of the actual production jobs that are putting their patents, their new research and development, into products that we buy is, in fact, done by overseas workers, not by workers here in the United States,” Burtless said. “It becomes a very complicated question: Is it helping employment in the United States, as opposed to is it maybe helping the wealth of people who are here in the United States,” he said.Critics also note that many such companies do the research regardless of the tax giveaways. Bills that would eliminate taxes on Internet access and provide tax credits for education also would not necessarily create jobs, according to Burtless.Neither would legislation aimed at helping households keep more of their income. For example, there is a Republican bill that would raise the eligibility cut-off for the full $1,000 child tax credit from $110,000 to $150,000.""If it were the only thing in a jobs bill, I would call it a jobs bill with a really, really lowercase 'J.' But in combination with other things ... then I think it could be an element of a jobs bill,"" said Ron Haskins, a Brookings Institution economist who focuses on family policy. ""In and of itself, it doesn't really deserve that title.""Education BillsBoehner's list includes four bills that purport to create jobs while addressing problems in the education sector. Cecilia Rouse, an education economist and the dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, said that not one of them would cause the kind of immediate ratcheting up of growth that Republicans envision.Two of these measures tackle student debt, by requiring colleges to offer broader loan counseling and by pushing the Department of Education to create a centralized source of information for potential college attendees. The only jobs that the first bill would likely create are a few more positions at institutions of higher education, Rouse said. Many colleges already have dedicated loan or financial aid counselors, on whose desks the additional work might well be placed. She said the second bill was unlikely to create many jobs either.The other two pieces of legislation try to wrest control of primary education from the federal government. The Student Success Act would boost states' ability to control education policy and give them greater flexibility in using federal funds, while the Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act would boost funding for -- and regulation of -- charter schools.Rouse said the economic impact of these bills is long-term and difficult to predict, particularly given conflicting evidence on the value of giving more money to charter schools. She added that this kind of legislation is often motivated by ideological belief. ""We know an engine of [economic] growth is education, so to the extent that one believes that federal control over K-12 is antithetical to a high-quality K-12 education, then one's going to believe"" that these bills will create jobs eventually, she said.Welfare BillsTwo of the ""jobs bills"" would allegedly help economic growth by reshaping welfare policy. One is the Paul Ryan budget, a proposal that economists have said would not only harm poorer Americans but also hinder job creation by depressing demand in the economy. The other welfare-related bill is the Preserving Work Requirements for Welfare Programs Act, passed by the House in 2013. Speaking on the House floor last year, Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.) said that the work requirements in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, originally put in place in 1996, led to “more work, more earnings, less welfare dependence and less poverty among families headed by low-income single mothers.” The purpose of the new legislation, he said, was ""ensuring that work and other productive activities remain a central part of the TANF cash welfare program.”But Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, questioned how much imposing work requirements would improve employment in a slow economy.“The problem with talking about these things is in a depressed economy, the jobs need to be there. If the jobs aren’t there, you can’t impose work requirements,” Strain said.Burtless, the Brookings economist, noted that ""pulling people’s fingernails out in order to get them to take a job does not add to the total stock of jobs in the economy.""Bills To Repeal The Affordable Care ActGiven how active the GOP has been in describing the president's health care plan as a job killer that hurts businesses and allows people to avoid work because they don't need employer-provided insurance, it's no surprise that Republicans count bills that would repeal or gut the policy as a way to create jobs. Proponents of this theory claimed that they were vindicated when a Congressional Budget Office report in February showed a drop in the total number of hours worked. But economists and other outside analysts pointed to a key aspect of the CBO report -- that Americans were choosing to work less or to leave the workforce because they had Obamacare benefits, not because Obamacare was destroying jobs. Increasing evidence from over the summer suggests that the Affordable Care Act is now a job creator in many parts of the country.Dan Diamond, executive editor of The Advisory Board's Daily Brief newsletter and a veteran health care writer, noted in a Forbes column in June that the health care industry had added almost 1 million jobs since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. He noted that the rest of the economy had added 7.7 million jobs in the same period, meaning more Americans were working than before the recession.""While the law may be creating new pressures on providers, it’s creating new sources of revenue. And that added revenue has a trickle-down effect for employers: It’s prompting them to add more staff, too,"" Diamond wrote.Business Deregulation BillsSome of Boehner's bills would reduce oversight of businesses beyond the energy sector. A prime example is the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act, which would exempt certain private equity funds from Securities and Exchange Commission registration and reporting requirements. Cutting these “unnecessary regulations that inhibit investments of private capital into small businesses” would allegedly create jobs.But Burtless isn't buying that argument.“I’m sure that there are individual private equity firms in the United States who regard this as a big deal because it’ll save them on paper work,” he said. But he added, “It’s just so small, I don’t see it as being particularly important.”Similar bills focusing on business regulation include the Working Families Flexibility Act, which would let workers trade overtime pay for unpaid time off, the Achieving Less Excess in Regulation and Requiring Transparency Act, which would impose procedural requirements on agencies implementing regulations, and the Innovation Act, which aims to decrease frivolous patent lawsuits.
