0,POLITICS,The U.S. Wants To Adopt A More Humane Drug Policy. Just Be Careful What You Call It.,Matt Ferner and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harm-reduction-drug-policy_us_56ec4523e4b09bf44a9d32d2,"A top drug official says he's open to a ""harm reduction"" approach to illicit drug use, but wants to find a new term for it.",2016-03-18,One harm reduction strategy involves expanding access to emergency opiate overdose kits like this one. The cone-shaped adapter turns liquid naloxone into a spray that helps a person start breathing again.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ec4a2b1e00009500710a71.jpeg?cache=Z1BAkNiNwm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Drug policy groups at a major gathering in Vienna last week were alarmed when a report emerged that a top U.S. drug official had derided harm reduction strategies as a coded way to describe drug legalization. It would have been a disheartening remark for drug reformers who will be pushing for the U.S. and other member nations to move away from draconian prohibitionist policies at next month's U.N. special session on drugs. And, indeed, The Huffington Post spoke with multiple advocates who attended the conference and were alarmed at the Vice report.A closer look at the context, though, suggests that Brownfield was describing the misconceptions of others.In recent years, Brownfield has been a proponent of drug policy reform, and just this week, he said that American officials were looking with other U.N. member states to “find areas of pragmatic reform” to drug policy. He has also called for “flexible” interpretations of the three-decades-old U.N. drug control treaties that critics say have restricted movement toward more progressive drug laws in the United States. Brownfield's full statement, provided to HuffPost by Open Society Foundations, shows he actually didn’t disparage harm reduction programs at all. Rather, he suggested that other people in the United States consider ""harm reduction"" to be a code for ""legalization,"" and so he tries to avoid using the term and advocates replacing it with a new one. (There are certainly some organizations that view harm reduction in a negative light because they believe the approach does not discourage drug use.).Brownfield’s full quote appears below:But in many ways for the United States government, the discussions over harm reduction are a labeling issue. In the United States, and I acknowledge, I am offering a national position, not a global position, over last 10 or 15 years, in common public usage, the term harm reduction has come increasingly to be interpreted as a backhanded way to describe legalization. What we have asked, respectfully, modestly, and humbly, in these discussions, is to find a new description or a new label. We are, as Mr. Botticelli has just indicated, in fact, not only comfortable with, but believe we play a leadership role in much of the rest of the world in terms of much of the substantive matter that the international community means when they say harm reduction, and in order to avoid the confusion that would ensue in our own country, our request is a very simple one of finding a new subject heading. If we mean reducing social damage caused by drugs, perhaps we can say, ‘reducing social damage caused by drugs,’ and in that way not contribute to confusion and passionate debate in at least one country in the UN system.Still, Vice said many drug reformers saw this argument as a straw man, wanting Brownfield himself to make a push for ""harm reduction."" When pressed for clarification on his remarks, Brownfield explained to HuffPost that his office regrets that “some organizations and individuals have come to associate the term ‘harm reduction’ with policies and programs consistent with legalization of dangerous and harmful drugs.”While the U.S. government does not support drug legalization as a national or global policy, Brownfield said that it does support strategies that address “health concerns and the social damage caused by harmful drugs.” Such strategies, he said, include “stronger public health focus in global drug policy, improved education, treatment and recovery support efforts, alternatives to incarceration and expanded use of the overdose reversal drug naloxone.” Much of this falls in line with typical harm reduction strategies. Michael Botticelli -- the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, who has moved the agency away from its “tough-on-crime” roots -- echoed Brownfield's position in his full remarks in Vienna this week, emphasizing the importance of a public health approach to drug policy.“We must make sure that our citizens have access to essential medicines for the relief of pain and suffering and to improve health and wellbeing,” Botticelli said. “Measures to prevent diversion are important, since prescription drug misuse can be a serious problem, but such efforts should not prevent fair access to those in need.”Much of the art of diplomacy is about the nuance of language. It may seem strange that the U.S. is willing to embrace the goal of harm reduction while blanching at the actual phrase ""harm reduction."" And while slightly different language -- like ""reducing the harms associated with drug use"" -- may be more palatable, the grammatical distinction between the two phrases is likely lost once they're translated into dozens of other languages at the U.N.Advocates for harm reduction say it’s a common-sense approach meant to reduce some of the negative consequences illicit drug users face. Harm reduction strategies can certainly include policies that limit, or altogether remove, criminal consequences for drug use and possession. But there's also a set of public health efforts that fall under the rubric of ""harm reduction"": providing access to clean kits, like needles or syringes, in order prevent the spread of diseases like HIV, or providing effective antidotes, like naloxone, to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.Rethinking the failed policies of the war on drugs comes at an especially critical time in the nation’s history, as America grapples with a heroin crisis that has already reached epidemic levels. Opioid abuse has been a growing problem among younger Americans in recent years, with many high school students starting to abuse prescription pills before transitioning to heroin. Opioid-related deaths have been surging.Almost 20 years ago, during the last U.N. special session on drugs, then-President Bill Clinton hyped the war on drugs, calling on partner nations to rely on law enforcement to crush the illicit drug trade. It didn’t work, and Clinton has since apologized for his role in escalating the global drug war. At home, he’s admitted that his signature crime bill that imposed mandatory minimum sentences for low-level drug crimes only “made the problem worse.”Drug reformers have been hoping that President Barack Obama will attend the special session this year at U.N. headquarters in New York City -- and that he'll deliver a different message than Clinton, touching on the points he made last year at a town hall meeting in Kingston, Jamaica. At that meeting, the president strongly denounced the war on drugs, calling it “very unproductive” for its emphasis on incarceration. Instead, he called for a public health perspective that would focus on “trying to get [people] into treatment,” combined with “economic development and alternative opportunities for youth.” But according to Obama's travel schedule, he isn't planning to be in New York at the time of the U.N. meeting next month.This article has been updated with additional context and a response from Vice."

Now, he spends day and night in a tiny, crowded ""Problematic Passengers Room"" at Istanbul's Atatürk Airport -- where he has been detained for more than a year. ""I have forgotten what it means to be human,"" Mansour told The WorldPost over email.He left Syria for Lebanon in 2012, but sought refuge in Turkey in 2014 after being kidnapped by a local gang, according to Amnesty International. His troubles didn't end there. The former law student worked with a smuggler to try to reach Europe via Malaysia, but he was denied entry and was returned to Atatürk Airport on March 15, 2015. Amnesty alleges that Turkish officials have held him there ever since without any legal reasoning. Beyond an iPad and a few articles of clothing he had with him when initially detained, Mansour has no possessions at the airport. He says his new living quarters have no natural light or fresh air. The room was designed to hold a capacity of three people, Mansour notes, but there are typically 30 to 40 passengers and other detainees crammed inside. He sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night to vomit, which he attributes to the poor air quality. Occasionally, Mansour is permitted to go into the hallway and sit in the metal seats. He says he sleeps on a ""very old and uncomfortable"" chair that converts to a bed, under artificial lights and an air conditioning unit that are never turned off. Mansour's daily meals consist of fast food from the airport, and he says he's been losing weight all year. Amnesty claims Mansour has been held in ""inhumane conditions,"" but the refugee says he cannot elaborate until he is freed. He lives in constant fear of being deported back to Syria, and says Turkish officials have warned him he will never be allowed to live in their country. The United Nations has registered more than 4.8 million Syrian refugees to date, and 2.7 million of them currently live in Turkey. Millions of others have fled to Europe to escape the violent conflict devastating their country. Mansour has applied for a visa to live with relatives in Australia, and his lawyer has asked the Turkish courts to approve his release, but both requests stand pending. While his future remains uncertain, he has has not given up hope.""I want to live; I need my freedom,"" he said. ""I am waiting for mercy."""

6,POLITICS,Journalist Arrested During Ferguson Protest Is Convicted,Mariah Stewart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mary-moore-journalist-ferguson_us_56ccda2ce4b0928f5a6d99fc,Videographer Mary Moore is among more than two dozen news professionals arrested covering protests since the police killing of teenager Michael Brown.,2016-03-18,"Freelance journalist Mary Moore before entering Ferguson Municipal Court Tuesday, March 24, 2015, in Ferguson, Missouri.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ST. LOUIS -- A freelance journalist has been convicted in Ferguson Municipal Court of failure to comply with a police order for taking video of a peaceful protest against police brutality in 2014.Mary Moore, a videographer who has worked with ABC, CNN and BET, was notified this week that Municipal Judge Donald McCullin dismissed charges of disturbing the peace and resisting arrest, and imposed a suspended sentence on the failure to comply conviction. The suspended sentence means Moore won't be punished if she avoids trouble in Ferguson for a year.Moore is one of least two dozen journalists arrested or detained covering Ferguson protests since the police shooting of teenager Michael Brown in August 2014. Some of the journalists have sued police over their arrests, and at least one has won a legal settlement. Moore said her conviction is likely to affect how she approaches her job covering news.“I think the failure to obey charge is very untruthful and unfair,"" said Moore, who claimed she followed police commands prior to her arrest. ""This is Ferguson’s way to control how and if we cover the news or exercise our rights. I feel like now it would be a target on my head.”Moore was among more than a dozen people arrested Oct. 2, 2014, during a protest outside the Ferguson Police Department. They were jailed for 18 hours until pastors intervened.Prosecutor Stephanie Karr argued during the trial last month for Moore and activist Erica Hallman that those who were arrested were standing in the street, disobeying police commands and disrupting officers. The prosecutor alleged Moore and Hallman were ""violent"" with police and ignored ""numerous"" warnings.Video played in court shows Moore recording with her cellphone on the sidewalk when she was seized.Ferguson police Sgt. Sean Brown said Moore “refused to release her hands before I arrested her.” “It was like a game of cat and mouse, so, we finally decided to enforce"" a noise curfew, Sgt. Dave Ryan testified. “She was interfering with my duties as a police officer.”A U.S. Justice Department investigation into Ferguson's police and judicial system following Michael Brown's killing found that the town's law against failing to comply with police “appears to be facially unconstitutional in part, and is frequently abused in practice.” DOJ said Ferguson police “rely heavily on this charge to arrest individuals who do not do what they ask, even when refusal is not a crime.” Ninety-four percent of people charged with failure to comply are black, according to DOJ, while two-thirds of Ferguson's population is African-American. Under an agreement reached with the Justice Department this week, Ferguson will amend the law and police will require a supervisor's approval before arresting someone on the charge.Karr, a part-time prosecutor for Ferguson and nearby towns, has arranged for traffic tickets to be dismissed at the request of the Ferguson mayor and police, according to the DOJ report.During last month's trial, Karr questioned Moore about her unsuccessful request that Ferguson Mayor James Knowles have the charges against her “taken care of.”Moore had a snappy comeback. “Isn’t that the same thing you did?” she asked the prosecutor.Editor’s note: One of the editors of this story, Ryan Reilly, is facing a trespass charge in St. Louis County Municipal Court in connection with his arrest in Ferguson on Aug. 13, 2014."

Rick Snyder (R) appointed oversaw the switch to the Flint River as its source in 2014.Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has been a vocal about the law for some time, referring to Flint as the predicted outcome of the state's long, dangerous history with unelected emergency managers. He has said that the legislation usurps democracy in every regard.“We cannot undo the damage already done by the lead-poisoned water in Flint or fix the harm already caused by the hazardous conditions in Detroit’s public schools,"" Conyers said. ""But we can stand together and make sure the unaccountable emergency managers responsible for these disasters -- and the legal system that empowered them -- are not permitted to inflict further harm on our citizens or our constitutional rights.""Conyers said the Emergency Financial Manager Reform Act of 2016 ensures that only elected lawmakers are in charge of making decisions for the people. The bill, which Michigan Reps. Brenda Lawrence, Dan Kildee and 29 other House Democrats back, aims to address unchecked decision-making power of those appointed to be emergency financial managers in embattled cities like Flint. Darnell Earley, the emergency manager at the time the switch, insisted he had nothing to do with the water catastrophe during a hearing on Tuesday before the House Oversight Committee, blaming his predecessor and the Flint City Council for approving the switch even though the local government authority had no official power at the time.“The Emergency Manager Law has allowed unelected officials to manage localities while effectively silencing the voice of the people they are supposed to serve,"" Lawrence said in a statement about the bill. ""After four emergency managers were appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder in Flint, and many more have been placed throughout Michigan, we have seen a series of disastrous decisions based entirely on bottom line economics result in incalculable harm to our citizens.""The bill would authorize the U.S. Attorney General to withhold five percent of law enforcement funds that otherwise would be allocated to a state under a cornerstone federal criminal justice program if a state-appointed emergency manager fails to protect against certain abuses. The abuses, outlined in the bill language, include discriminatory impact on voting rights, harm to public health or safety, conflicts of interest, mismanagement and abuse of discretion. It also covers unilateral rejection of collective bargaining agreements and other contractual obligations without mutual consent, and a lack of notice to affected communities who cannot provide comment.The legislation has garnered early support from the American Civil Liberties Union, United Auto Workers Union, American Federation of Teachers, the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network and the chairs of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus.""It was decisions by such unelected emergency financial managers that led to the current water crisis in Flint,"" Kildee said.""They are entirely bottom-line focused, bringing a failed philosophy to government that puts saving money at any cost ahead of the livelihood of people. Under Michigan’s current laws, democracy is suspended in cities like Flint in favor of absolute power in the hands of emergency financial managers."""

The comment that went too far for Kasich: the real estate mogul's warning of ""riots"" later this summer if GOP officials move to deny him the nomination.In a series of tweets signed ""John,"" Kasich chided the GOP presidential front-runner for using ""unacceptable language.""On Wednesday, Trump warned of ""riots"" at the Republican National Convention in July if he arrives with fewer than the required number of delegates to clinch the nomination, but still more than his rivals have, and doesn't get the party's nod.""If you disenfranchise those people, and you say, 'Well, I'm sorry, but you're 100 votes short,' even though the next one is 500 votes short, I think you would have problems like you've never seen before. I think bad things would happen,"" Trump said. ""I wouldn't lead it, but I think bad things would happen.""Kasich has attempted to draw a contrast between himself and his mud-slinging rivals by giving his candidacy a sunny, positive tone. While taking issue with the Trump campaign's ""toxic atmosphere,"" he has largely refrained from criticizing Trump the man. Kasich has dodged questions over Trump's fitness for the presidency in TV interviews and has stuck by his pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee even if that person is Trump.The strategy has had some success: On Tuesday, Kasich won his home state's GOP primary.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

It's the first of a series of experiments in zero gravity designed to address what NASA project manager Gary Ruff calls ""one of the greatest crew safety concerns.""On Earth, gravity gives fire a familiar structure, with colder, denser air falling to the base of the flame and heat rising. But without the organizing principle of gravity, flames in space can be very unpredictable. NASA plans to light the ""large-scale fire"" inside a cargo spaceship after delivering food, supplies and hardware to the International Space Station. Its commercial partner Orbital ATK is scheduled to launch the Cygnus cargo vehicle from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Tuesday.The fiery fun begins two months later, as it heads away from the ISS and back toward Earth.Researchers involved in Spacecraft Fire Experiment I, also known as Saffire I, will remotely ignite a one by three-foot piece of material, a blend of fiberglass and cotton, inside a 3-by-5-foot module. Sensors and high definition video cameras will capture the action, with the valuable data eventually sent back to Earth.""Saffire will be the biggest man-made fire ever in space,"" Ruff said in a statement. ""Currently, we can only conduct small combustion experiments in the microgravity environment of the space station. Saffire will allow us to safely burn larger samples of material without added risk to the station or its crew.""NASA aerospace engineer Dan Dietrich had previously told Smithsonian Magazine that there had been experiments earlier ""where we observed fires that we didn’t think could exist, but did.”David Urban, principal investigator, said in a statement that this and future Saffire experiments NASA has planned seek to answer two questions: Will an upward spreading flame continue to grow or will microgravity limit the size? And, what fabrics and materials will catch fire and how will they burn?Once NASA has the data it needs from Saffire, Cygnus will reenter Earth's atmosphere and be destroyed in a second, and much larger, inferno.See the video below for more on the Saffire fire experiment."

Forty-eight percent of respondents across all age groups were either “somewhat” or “very” concerned that a similar water safety crisis could happen in their own communities, while 47 percent were either “not very” or “not at all” concerned.But when the responses were broken down by age, the youngest and oldest respondents were less likely to say they were worried about a Flint-like crisis happening close to home.Only 10 percent of respondents under age 30 said they were “very” concerned about a similar crisis happening in their communities, while 50 percent were “not very” or “not at all” concerned.

While 71 percent of respondents said they were at least “somewhat” confident their water was currently safe to drink, only 46 percent believed it would be safe in 20 years.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Real estate billionaire Donald Trump's coarse rhetoric has won him some fans, but there's at least one large group in America that is increasingly unimpressed: women.Half of U.S. women say they have a ""very unfavorable"" view of the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, up from the 40 percent who felt that way in October. The survey was taken from March 1-15, and included 5,400 respondents.The rise in anti-Trump sentiment among women could pose a problem for the New York billionaire in his quest for the White House. Women form just over half of the U.S. population, and they have turned out at higher rates than men in every election since 1996, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.""If the presidential election were tomorrow, women would be a big problem for Trump,"" Republican strategist David Carney said. ""But he has time to fix it.""A Trump campaign official did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Trump has said that he has had good relationships with women in his business career and is well-liked bywomen voters.Several women who oppose Trump, interviewed by Reuters this week, said their disapproval was based on a range of factors from his disparaging comments about women he dislikes - such as Fox News host Megyn Kelly - to his hard-line views on immigration and his ribald exchanges with rivals.""I think Trump is very scary,"" said Mariah Dobias, a 25-year-old cook who was voting in Ohio's primary on Tuesday. ""He says he is going to make America great, but he doesn't say how he is going to do it besides alienating whole groups of people.""Carolyn Hostetler, a conservative from Tennessee, told Reuters she disliked ""the way he has belittled women.""Some of Trump's female supporters, meanwhile, said they liked his straight talk, and believe he could strengthen America's position on the world stage.""He's a little unpredictable, as we've seen,"" said Kathleen Douglas, a 65-year-old college professor from Winter Park, Florida who supports Trump. ""He's going to put other world leaders on edge.""Trump does not have a similar image problem with men. The Reuters/Ipsos polling results showed that just 36 percent of men said they have a ""very unfavorable"" opinion of Trump, a level that has held steady in recent months.Republican women are also much more likely to approve of Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Among women who identify as Republican, he has been holding around 60 percent favorability since the start of the year.Trump's relative appeal among men versus women was evident in the most recent round of nominating contests on Tuesday, when Trump extended a broad lead over rivals.In Florida, exit polls conducted by Edison Research showed that Trump's support among Republican women voters was 40 percent, versus 52 percent among males. In Ohio, where Trump came in second to the state's governor, John Kasich, 33 percent of women voters backed Trump, compared with 40 percent of men.If the GOP frontrunner were to run against Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton in the general election, likely women voters would support Clinton over Trump by nearly 14 percentage points, according to the March polling data. Among men, Clinton would win by about 5 percentage points.At a precinct in Florida's Winter Park, Darlene Monzadeh, a 52-year-old stay-at-home mom who had been a supporter of Jeb Bush, said Trump lost her vote during a debate when he exchanged potshots with his rivals.""It changed my opinion. When they catfight all the time and act like little boys, pointing fingers, raising voices,"" she said, adding she now supports Kasich.Trump has been accused by critics of misogyny since he launched his campaign. He complained last year that Fox News host Megyn Kelly had asked him tough questions in a debate and referred to ""blood coming out of her wherever."" He more recently sent a Twitter post suggesting she was a ""bimbo.""He has called television personality Rosie O'Donnell a ""fat pig"" and made fun of former presidential rival and ex-HP chief executive Carly Fiorina's face, saying, ""Would anyone vote for that?""An anti-Trump attack ad launched by the Our Principles Super PAC this week featured womenrepeating words that Trump has used to describe women, including ""fat pig"" and ""dog.""Several of his female supporters defended Trump against the ad on social media.(Additional reporting by Cassandra Garrison in Ohio, Amy Tennery in New York, Barbara Liston in Florida, Colleen Jenkins in North Carolina; Writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Alan Crosby)"

Deal has made clear that he will not sign a bill that allows discrimination, but his office did not immediately respond to request for comment on Wednesday night.Similar bills in states like Indiana and Arkansas sparked storms of criticism last year, forcing many lawmakers to retreat from the provisions.The Georgia bill, reworked several times by lawmakers amid criticism that earlier versions went too far, declares that no pastor can be forced to perform a same-sex wedding.The bill also grants faith-based organizations – churches, religious schools or associations - the right to reject holding events for people or groups of whom they object.

Yazidis because they are Yazidis. Shi'ites because they are Shi'ites,"" Kerry said, referring to the group by an Arabic acronym, and accusing it of crimes against humanity and of ethnic cleansing.While the genocide finding may make it easier for the United States to argue for greater action against the group, it does not create a legal obligation on the United States to do more.On Wednesday, a State Department spokesman Mark Toner said: ""Acknowledging that genocide or crimes against humanity have taken place in another country would not necessarily result in any particular legal obligation for the United States.""Islamic State militants have swept through Iraq and Syria in recent years, seizing control of large swathes of territory with an eye toward establishing jihadism in the heart of the Arab world.The group's videos depict the violent deaths of people who stand in its way. Opponents have been beheaded, shot dead, blown up with fuses attached to their necks and drowned in cages lowered into swimming pools, with underwater cameras capturing their agony.U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered air strikes against the group but has not made any large commitment of U.S. troops on the ground.""It may strengthen our hand getting other countries to help. It may free us against some (legal) constraints, but the reality is that when you are fighting somebody, you don't need another reason to fight them,"" said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.PREVENTIVE ACTION?Kerry argued that the United States has done much to fight the group since the start of air strikes in 2014, but did not directly answer a question on why the Obama administration had not done more to prevent genocide.Historians have asked the same question about Darfur and Rwanda, both places where the United States also concluded that genocide had taken place.Islamic State militants have exploited the five-year civil war in Syria to seize areas in that country and in neighboring Iraq, though U.S. officials say their air strikes have markedly reduced the amount of territory the group controls in both.On-again, off-again peace talks got under way this week in Geneva in an effort to end the civil war, in which at least 250,000 people have died and millions have fled their homes. A fragile ""cessation of hostilities"" has reduced, but not ended, the violence over the last two weeks.U.S. lawmakers urged Kerry last year to make a determination on whether atrocities committed by the militant group against Christians and other religious groups amounted to genocide.The State Department earlier had predicted it would miss a deadline set for Thursday on this decision.Republicans, who control the U.S. Congress, have been pressuring the Democratic Obama administration to call the militants' atrocities in Iraq and Syria acts of genocide. This week, one chamber, House of Representatives, passed a resolution labeling the group's violence against religious and ethnic minorities as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.A U.S. administration has not made a genocide finding since 2004, when it determined genocide had occurred in Darfur and that the government of Sudan was responsible.Asked if the genocide finding was likely to accentuate a view held by some that the West is engaged in a battle with Islam, a senior U.S. official noted that Kerry's determination included Shi-ite Muslims as well as Christians and Yazidis.""A very large Muslim group is included in this,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""The secretary isn't just singling out one group that has political support in the United States,"" he added, referring to Christians.(Editing by Bernadette Baum)"

22,MEDIA,No One's Asking Donald Trump About Campaign Manager Accused Of Grabbing Reporter,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-media-corey-lewandowski_us_56ead17fe4b065e2e3d8ac7a,"The Republican front-runner has done more than a dozen TV interviews without getting a single  question about his top aide, Corey Lewandowski.",2016-03-17,Corey Lewandowski notably stood on stage next to GOP front-runner Donald Trump on Tuesday night after facing more allegations about rough treatment of reporters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields filed a police report Friday alleging that Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski assaulted her after a press conference, the GOP front-runner has done more than a dozen TV interviews amounting to over two and a half hours of airtime.And in all that time, Fields’ charge hasn’t come up once. Neither have more recent allegations against Lewandowski. Politico reported Tuesday that the top Trump aide has treated reporters roughly and made “sexually suggestive and at times vulgar comments"" to and about female journalists covering the campaign. Lewandowski denied the claims. As Lewandowski’s behavior has gone unquestioned in Trump's recent interviews on ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, Fox News, MSNBC and CNN, the business mogul has only helped thrust his campaign manager further into the national spotlight.Trump notably brought Lewandowski up on stage during his Tuesday night victory speech in Florida, praising him while he berated the reporters in attendance as “disgusting” and “horrible people.” Lewandowski enjoyed the media-bashing while Trump refused to take reporters’ questions, even though the gathering was purportedly a “press conference.” One of the Politico reporters behind Tuesday's story was barred from the event, the latest in a pattern of retribution against news outlets that are critical of Trump.Television journalists have subjected Trump to tough questions over the past week about encouraging violence at his events, with Friday night’s cable news takeover understandably focused on the candidate's decision to cancel a Chicago rally. Some have also pressed Trump on the $40 million fraud lawsuit involving Trump University, his employment of foreign workers, his lack of a foreign policy team, and his past misogynistic remarks, resurrected in a new ad from an anti-Trump super PAC. They've also, of course, asked about Trump's recent victories and the state of the primary race. Still, the lack of questions about the police report Fields filed against Lewandowski has been maddening to Trump's critics, who see it as a serious issue that's going completely unaddressed. Several journalists have pointed out when TV interviewers fail to bring it up, despite the incident's relevance to other questions about violence at Trump's campaign events and his treatment of women. While interviewers haven't pressed Trump on the Lewandowski incident since Friday, other presidential candidates are discussing it. After Trump’s appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said that “Trump's own campaign manager is now up on charges for assaulting a female reporter, bruising her.”Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fl.), who has since suspended his campaign, also brought it up on ABC’s “This Week"" on Sunday and again the next day.“If my campaign manager had done that, my campaign would be over,” Rubio said on Monday. “He would have had to resign.""Campaigns often move swiftly when top aides are embroiled in controversy, given their expectation that candidates will face questions from the media. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) fired his communications director last month after he posted a video on Facebook that falsely questioned Rubio’s faith. “We are not a campaign that is going to question the faith of another candidate,"" Cruz told reporters. Trump has weathered numerous media controversies that would have likely sunk another candidate. And in this case, he has quite literally stood by Lewandowski as his campaign denies the assault allegation.On March 10, the Trump campaign dismissed Fields' claim that Lewandowski had grabbed and bruised her arm after Trump's press conference in Jupiter, Florida two days earlier -- an incident witnessed by a Washington Post reporter. “You are totally delusional,” Lewandowski tweeted that afternoon at Fields. “I never touched you.”Trump suggested after the March 10 debate that Fields had fabricated her story. But new video emerged on March 11 that shows Lewandowski reaching toward Fields. Though Trump supporters have questioned the severity of the incident, the video appears to support Fields’ claim. Jupiter police are investigating the matter. The Lewandowski allegations have received attention on cable news when Trump isn't on air, however.Fox News host Megyn Kelly has twice interviewed Fields since she filed the police report, and a Trump spokesperson rebutted the allegations again on Monday night. Several cable news guests, meanwhile, noted it was significant that Trump told Lewandowski “good job” while on stage with him Tuesday night. CNN contributor Amanda Carpenter said Lewandowski “has been under intense media fire for his horrible treatment of the press, to anyone that comes into contact with him.”“That was a signal,” Carpenter said. “He is telling everyone, ‘I am not changing my campaign’s behavior. You can go with me or go against me, but I’m not changing.’”At Fox News, The Weekly Standard's Stephen Hayes said, “Lewandowski being in the picture, given the events of the past week, was troubling and will cause people to raise additional questions.”Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

The animal was discovered mummified in permafrost last year.This is the first well-preserved predator brain from the Pleistocene era that scientists have discovered, Dr. Pavel Nikolsky, a research fellow at the Geological Institute in Moscow, told The Siberian Times.""The carcass is preserved really very well,"" Nikolsky said. ""And one of the most important things is that the brain is preserved.""Having access to such a vivid sample of an early domestic dog could go a long way in determining how canines evolved.""There are still important and incompletely resolved questions about how developmental patterns in early dogs differed from those of closely related (and ultimately ancestral) canid lineages,"" Daniel Fisher of the University of Michigan's Museum of Paleontology told The Huffington Post.""We would like to know more about how and when the lineages that gave rise to dogs came to differ from their wolf relatives, and judging the age and stage of development of various features on a specimen like this could help to understand some of this history,"" he said.Studying the ancient dog's intestinal contents, he added, could teach scientists about its diet, which in turn could indicate how much time it spent with humans. Hwang Woo-suk of South Korea was one of the researchers involved in the autopsy of the dog, which took place in Yakutsk, Russia. Although he once fraudulently declared that he had cloned a human embryo, he reportedly has had some real success cloning dogs and is interested in cloning the one discovered last year.However, Fisher, who is familiar with the research but was not involved with it, said the chances of cloning even a well-preserved sample of the prehistoric pup are ""very slim.""""The problem is that even for tissues preserved in permafrost, the DNA is highly fragmented,"" Fisher said. ""Most permafrost is not as cold as would be ideal for preservation of fresh tissues, and the tissue was probably not frozen as quickly following death as would be necessary if cloning were to be practical.""Besides, he added, ""We have not seen much on the cloning front that really advances our understanding of these animals.""Another puppy, believed to be a sibling of the one scientists performed the autopsy on, was found in the area in 2011 but was not as well-preserved, according to reports."

25,WOMEN,5 Ways Texas' Draconian Abortion Laws Actively Hurt Women,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-ways-texas-draconian-abortion-laws-actively-hurt-women_us_56eab7dce4b065e2e3d88fa1,New data shows why SCOTUS' ruling on HB2 matters.,2016-03-17,Another new study shows the many ways Texas' abortion clinic closures hamper access for women.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56eab8b8150000ad000b2572.jpeg?cache=C4TEEAn8LR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States Supreme Court is now considering the fate of Texas' House Bill 2, or HB2, one of the most restrictive abortion laws in this country, and arguably the most important reproductive rights case the court has heard in decades. The law mandates clinics upgrade to surgical-grade facilities, and requires abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at local hospitals.And it has completely crushed the state's abortion clinics. Since HB2 was signed into law in 2013, more than half of Texas' abortion clinics have closed. That has significant implications, both for women in that state and beyond.""I'm not a legal expert, but as a person who studies reproductive health I can say that what I do know is that the exact same types of laws are being introduced in many other states,"" said Liza Fuentes, a co-investigator at the Texas Policy Evaluation Project (TxPEP) and author of a study published online Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health that measures the effects of HB2 on abortion access.""It's very fair to say this isn't a Texas-specific problem,"" she added.Here's a reminder of what's at stake and how, exactly, the abortion clinic closures hurt women:1) When women's nearest clinic closed, they had to travel four times longer to get an abortion.In the new study, researchers with TxPEP interviewed nearly 400 women who were at a clinic, seeking an abortion at some point during the summer of 2014. Nearly 40 percent of the women had experienced the closure of their closest clinic. Among those women, the average one-way trip to the next nearest clinic was nearly 70 miles, compared to just 17 miles before the law passed. And for many, the distance was much longer: 10 percent lived more than 250 miles away from a clinic.That presents a challenge in and of itself, but especially because Texas requires that women make at least two visits for a surgical abortion, including an ultrasound that must be done 24 hours prior to the procedure. A medication abortion, i.e., the so-called abortion pill, requires four visits: an ultrasound and state-mandated counseling session, two visits to receive two doses of the drug, plus another after the procedure is complete.2) They were also three times more likely to have to stay somewhere overnight.More than 15 percent of women whose closest clinic closed said they needed to make overnight arrangements, compared to just 5 percent whose closest clinic was still open. 3) Thirty percent had to spend more than $100 beyond the price of the procedure.Abortions can be expensive. A surgical abortion can cost up to $1,500 in the first trimester. Medication abortions can cost up to $800. But beyond whatever they had to pay for the procedure itself, more than 30 percent of women whose nearest clinic closed spent $100-plus in additional out-of-pocket expenses, like transportation and overnight costs, as well as lost wages and child care.For some, that's huge. ""For women who are struggling to make ends meet,"" Fuentes said, ""that could be the difference between getting an abortion or not.""4) Nearly 40 percent of women whose nearest clinic closed couldn't get the type of abortion they wanted.Some 37 percent of women whose nearest clinic closed didn't get a medication abortion, even though it was what they wanted, compared to just 22 percent of women whose closest clinic was still open. While a lot of factors likely contributed, the fact that Texas requires four visits no doubt plays a role. 5) And those are all obstacles faced by women who ultimately got care. Others simply don't.The new TxPEP study focused on women who were actually able to get themselves to a clinic and have an abortion. Others can't, and they don't. Indeed, an earlier TxPEP investigation found that the state's abortion rate dropped by 13 percent after HB2 was implemented. That decline may reflect the fact that many women are simply traveling out of state to have the procedure, Fuentes said, but it's also true that some women simply aren't getting abortions because the barriers are too great. ""It's true that you can say, 'OK, it's a long trip, but [women] can make it,'"" she said. ""But when you start piling on distance, having to stay overnight, then not getting the procedure one wants, what emerges is really a burden that we don't see with any other medical procedures."""

John Conyers (D-Mich.) said Wednesday that Congress needs to ensure that everyone at fault in the Flint water crisis answers for their crimes.“We need to make sure that those responsible for this thing meet the accountability standard. They should be arrested. They should be tried,” Conyers said.Does that include Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder?“Sure does,” Conyers told The Huffington Post afterward. “He’s No. 1.”Conyers is the first member of Congress to publicly say that Snyder or anyone involved with the crisis should be arrested, though others have called for criminal investigations. Conyers, along with other House Democrats, signed a letter of support in February for Attorney General Loretta Lynch's announced criminal investigation into the crisis. But he has been on a tear the last 24 hours on Capitol Hill. Conyers introduced a bill to reform Michigan’s emergency manager laws on Thursday morning, met with families from Flint on the Hill later Thursday for Snyder’s testimony in front of Congress and held a press conference Friday with Rev. Al Sharpton to formally introduce the bill.Conyers said he's just getting started. Congress needs to hold more hearings, he said, not only about Flint but also about lead poisoning throughout the United States.“We don’t want to act like we’ve done just this one where tragedy has struck already. There is lead and other contaminants in our water supplies that are being examined for the very first time,” Conyers said. “It’s in that spirit I come to this issue. We need more enforcement, more oversight and more concern.Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) wouldn’t completely back Conyers' remarks, but he said that a criminal investigation should look at every individual involved in the water catastrophe, including the governor.“If they determine the facts support prosecution, they should go with the fullest extent of the law,” Kildee said. Conyers, however, stuck to his guns about Snyder needing to be behind bars. “When you’ve poisoned the water, or allow the water to be poisoned, that’s against the law,” Conyers told HuffPost. “People end up with fatal diseases. Children are stunted in their growth and development. Seniors are grievously ill because of that. We can’t allow that to be happening. And we have to stop it wherever we can.”"

Five Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure: Reps. Carlos Curbelo, Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida; Rep. Robert Dold of Illinois and Rep. Richard Hanna of New York. The general party line has been that the deportation relief programs President Barack Obama announced in 2012 and 2014 are amnesty -- a buzzword used to refer to any and all policies not aimed at deportation. This unquestionably has become an issue of politics and policy. Republicans have argued that their opposition to Obama's immigration programs is about protecting the Constitution. Texas led 25 other states in filing a suit against the federal government in the case, arguing the president overstepped his authority and was doing harm to states. The Supreme Court will hear the case on April 18 and asked lawyers to argue not just over whether the states were able to sue, but also more broadly on whether Obama abdicated his responsibility to enforce the law, something lower courts had not definitively decided. Either way the ruling goes, it could have major implications on the election and on the millions of undocumented immigrants who have been blocked from receiving the relief they were promised in 2014. Both Democratic presidential candidates have promised to expand deportation relief, and Republican front-runner Donald Trump has said he would kill the policies and seek mass deportation.The resolution approved Thursday authorizes the House -- not members of Congress or the Republican conference, but the chamber as a whole -- to file an amicus brief siding with Texas. Democrats argued members were voting to approve something they had never seen, as the vote wasn't on an actual brief, but just to authorize the House to create one. Ryan argued the brief was necessary because Obama violated the Constitution by failing to execute the laws and because Congress, not the president, makes laws. ""We must defend the principle of self-determination, of self-government, of government by consent of the governed,"" he said on the House floor. The House has voted previously as a whole to get involved in litigation, most recently when it voted to sue the Obama administration over certain appropriations in Affordable Care Act funding. But congressional legal action is typically decided by a bipartisan legal advisory group, not by a vote of the full House. Ryan's office told reporters that the law firm of Paul Clement -- a renowned Supreme Court litigator -- was representing the House pro bono, and would likely ask the Supreme Court to participate in oral arguments.The main policy in question in the lawsuit is the 2014 Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, which would allow some undocumented parents to apply for temporary work permits and conditional status to remain in the country. The lawsuit also aims to block an expansion of the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which grants the same protections to certain undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The first iteration of that program remains in effect, but its expansion has been blocked.Obama said when he announced the programs that they were within the executive's authority for prosecutorial discretion, or how the Department of Homeland Security prioritizes its enforcement of the law given limited resources. The argument is that screening and approving some undocumented immigrants for deferred action on deportation would allow agents to focus on removing others, such as convicted criminals and national security threats. It isn't an apolitical matter on the Democratic side, either: Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) both said they would go beyond DAPA and DACA to issue protections for an even broader group of undocumented immigrants. Democrats have also gotten involved in the case, although in a crucially different way -- not on behalf of an entire chamber, but in groups. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and 223 other Democrats in Congress filed their own amicus brief earlier this month. Leaders from nearly 120 cities and counties did the same. Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) said on a call with reporters ahead of the vote that Republicans should take the same tack, if they want to get involved. He and other Democrats said Republicans were standing with Trump, whose rhetoric some of them have condemned, with the vote. ""The vote today is a political stunt disguised as a legal brief because the Republican majority sees a crass political opportunity to stand with the anti-immigration wing of their party,"" Gutiérrez said. ""They keep saying, 'Well, Trump doesn't represent us, he doesn't [represent] our views, he doesn't represent our values,' and now they want to know where Trump gets all of his anti-immigrant, xenophobic ideas from. Try the House of Representatives."" "

33,POLITICS,Rick Snyder Says A Water Crisis Like Flint's Could Happen Anywhere,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rick-snyder-congress_us_56ea098ce4b0860f99db8f29,"The Michigan governor admits he blew it, but warns others could blow it without new regulations.",2016-03-17,Rick Snyder has his eye on the underlying problem that caused the Flint water crisis. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_8_161_3885_2111%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Though Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) admits that his government caused the Flint water crisis, he told Congress on Thursday morning it's something that could happen anywhere that has lead pipes.""The truth is, there are many communities with potentially dangerous lead problems,"" Snyder said in his testimony before the House Oversight Committee.If the ""dumb and dangerous"" federal regulations of lead pipes don't change, Snyder said, ""then this tragedy will befall other American cities.""Flint's water became poisonous in 2014 after Snyder's government oversaw a switch to the Flint River as the city's water source but failed to ensure its proper treatment.""Not a day or night goes by that this tragedy doesn’t weigh on my mind ... the questions I should have asked ... the answers I should have demanded ... how I could have prevented this,"" Snyder said in his testimony. For nearly 18 months, Michigan officials dismissed Flint residents' complaints that their water looked and tasted bad, while also ignoring red flags raised by state officials. Snyder said he didn't figure it out until October, when the state finally told Flint residents not to drink from their taps because the lead levels in Flint kids' blood had shot up.Small children exposed to lead -- even in small amounts -- can suffer permanent brain damage and behavioral problems. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the committee's top Democrat, excoriated the governor for his role in the crisis. ""There will now be an entire generation of children who suffer from brain damage, learning disabilities and many other horrible effects of lead poisoning that were inflicted on them by Governor Synder's administration,"" Cummings said. ""Gov. Snyder's administration caused this horrific disaster and poisoned the children of Flint.""Toward the end of the hearing, Cummings told Snyder he couldn't be trusted. ""And I got to tell you, you need to resign,"" he said.And Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) told Snyder he was ""dripping with guilt"" and that he should resign. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act regulations require public water systems to add chemicals that reduce the corrosiveness of drinking water, since corrosive water can leach lead from lead pipes -- but the state misread the regulations and the Environmental Protection Agency, the law's top enforcer, said last fall that the requirements were ambiguous.Snyder's partner at the witness table was EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, whose testimony heaped almost all the blame for Flint on Snyder. ""While EPA did not cause the lead problem, in hindsight, we should not have been so trusting of the state for so long when they provided us with overly simplistic assurances of technical compliance rather than substantive responses to our growing concerns,"" McCarthy said.McCarthy's testimony drew some skepticism from both Republicans and Democrats on the oversight committee. At a Tuesday hearing featuring an EPA official who resigned amid Flint fallout, lawmakers criticized the agency for failing to act on warnings from one of its own scientists that Flint's water was unsafe. Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) repeated that criticism on Thursday and then some. ""If you're going to do the courageous thing, you, too, should step down,"" he told McCarthy.Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) mocked Republicans for saying the EPA should have been more aggressive in Michigan, since many of them often lament agency interference on other issues.""Republicans have been absolutely slamming the EPA for overreaching at every possible turn,"" Clay said. ""Now they criticize the EPA for not doing more when Gov. Snyder fell down on the job.""In calling out Safe Drinking Water Act regulations, Snyder is aligning himself with outside experts who last year fought his government to expose the dangerous lead levels in Flint's water, including Flint pediatrician Mona Hannah-Attisha and Virginia Tech corrosion expert Marc Edwards. Both have called for federal regulations to change so that public water systems act more aggressively to replace lead pipes, which currently carry water to millions of homes across America. In testimony before the committee on Tuesday, Edwards said the EPA should apologize for its role in Flint so the agency can be ""worthy of the public trust and its noble mission."""
