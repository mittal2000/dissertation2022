His rampage ended when he turned his gun on himself as police arrived.Multiple shooting incidents have taken place at U.S. schools since Newtown, with fatal attacks in Nevada, Oregon and Colorado over the past year. Riccio called such incidents one of the greatest risks schools face.""An active shooting event can happen at any time and is the biggest threat that faces law enforcement along with a terrorist attack,"" he said. ""What must happen during such an attack is to identify where the shooting is taking place and going there immediately to subdue the shooter."" (Editing by Scott Malone and Lisa Shumaker)"

His loss has impacted millions, and the outpouring of love and support for him and his family is clearly evident. The media will cover his passing extensively and the reaction to his tragic death for most of us is like that of losing a close friend. Developments continue to appear in the story of this tragedy, with the most recent statement by Williams' wife noting that he suffered from the early stages of Parkinson's disease in addition to depression, substance abuse and anxiety. Despite his struggles, in his life and in his films, Robin Williams always seemed to know exactly what to say. So many of his lines are quotable, and yet, at his passing, we are stunned into silence.But silence should not be the legacy of a man who caused entire theaters to burst into laughter. In the wake of this tragedy, we must find the strength for an ongoing conversation about mental health, a topic that is too often addressed in whispers. Mental illness affects all of us. One in four adults and one in five children, at any point in time, have a diagnosable mental illness and one of two Americans will suffer one at some point in their lives. Suicide will claim one American every 13 minutes and 12 times that number will make an attempt each day. However, as is the case this week, we often only consider mental health issues when a celebrity loses his or her life or a dramatic event happens. As a society, we have to do better than this.As the public facts of Williams' case typify, the vast majority of those who attempt suicide suffer from a mental illness. Most feel desperate and they experience such psychic pain that, even with compelling reasons to live, suicide seems like the only solution. Often, suicide is preceded by periods of self-medication through drugs and alcohol, which offer immediate relief then contribute to agitation and increased depression upon withdrawal. We also know that most people who contemplate suicide have recently seen a physician and have confided in someone about their desperate feelings. Like any other chronic condition, a serious depression typically requires multiple courses of treatment, consistent family and social support and a lifestyle change that acknowledges that one is always ""in recovery.""Our society must work to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness so that people will feel more willing to seek care. Reticence to seek help (and repeated help) due to fears of judgment (by others or oneself) is a significant contributor to tragic outcomes. We have excellent treatments, including medications, cognitive-behavioral therapy, family therapy and psychodynamic therapy, and we need to do more to make these accessible to those in need. It is time to bring mental illness out of the shadows and into the spotlight. We should not wait for tragedy to strike before we raise our voices and fight for the proper mental healthcare.Of course, this is easier said than done; something that will be achieved with long-term thought rather than short-term solutions. However, we have seen such change accomplished with many challenging medical conditions such as cancer and HIV/AIDS. We must anticipate that ending this stigma will take time, but that it is achievable if we all work to make it happen. Sadly, there is nothing that we can do for this beloved man; but we can honor his memory by being the change that prevents others from taking their lives and suffering without adequate mental health resources. We need to make sure that conversations about depression, substance abuse and suicide do not stop when the news cycle's focus shifts away from Robin Williams' passing. Starting today, let's bring mental health into the spotlight. Let's repay Robin Williams for decades of laughs by helping those who also struggle with mental illness. Need help?

Both groups are designated under the U.N. al Qaeda sanctions regime.Friday's resolution named six people who will be subject to an international travel ban, asset freeze and arms embargo, including Islamic State spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, an Iraqi described by U.N. experts as one of the group's ""most influential emirs"" and close to its leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi.The Islamic State's swift and brutal push to the borders of Iraq's autonomous ethnic Kurdish region and toward Baghdad has sparked the first U.S. air strikes in Iraq since the withdrawal of American troops in 2011.The Security Council resolution ""deplores and condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist acts of ISIL (Islamic State) and its violent extremist ideology, and its continued gross, systematic and widespread abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law."" It also blacklisted Said Arif, a former Algerian army officer who escaped house arrest in France in 2013 and joined Nusra Front in Syria, and Abdul Mohsen Abdallah Ibrahim al-Charekh of Saudi Arabia, dubbed ""a leading terrorist internet propagandist"" who heads Nusra Front in Syria's Latakia district.Hamid Hamad Hamid al-Ali and Hajjaj bin Fahd al-Ajmi, both from Kuwait, were sanctioned for allegedly providing financial support to Nusra Front - Ajmi's fundraising includes at least one Twitter campaign, according U.N. experts - while Abdelrahman Mouhamad Zafir al Dabidi al Jahani of Saudi Arabia was named because he runs Nusra Front's foreign fighter networks.Britain initially aimed to adopt the text by the end of August, but accelerated its plan after a surge by Islamic State, which poses the biggest threat to Iraq since Saddam Hussein was toppled by a U.S.-led invasion in 2003.The resolution condemns the recruitment of foreign fighters and expresses readiness to blacklist people financing or facilitating travel of foreign fighters. It expresses concern that revenue generated from oilfields captured by both groups is being used to organize attacks.Islamic State militants are selling oil from oilfields in Iraq and refineries they control to local communities and smugglers, augmenting their existing ample finances, U.S. intelligence officials said on Thursday.The resolution condemns any direct or indirect trade with Islamic State or Nusra Front and warns such moves could lead to sanctions. It asks U.N. experts - charged with monitoring violations of the council's al Qaeda sanctions regime - to report in 90 days on the threat posed by Islamic State and Nusra Front, and on details of their recruitment and funding.The resolution is under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which makes it legally binding for U.N. member states and gives the council authority to enforce decisions with economic sanctions or force. However, it does not mandate military force to tackle the insurgents. (Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Louis Charbonneau and Frances Kerry)"

Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer on Saturday. Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, has experienced three days of violent protests since the killing. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d2dc24000051005771fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- On Wednesday night, reporters from The Huffington Post and The Washington Post made national news when police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, assaulted and arrested them for not obeying orders quickly enough. Outrage, a demand for answers and calls for press freedom grew as word of what happened spread on social media. Shortly thereafter, the two men were released, in part, it seemed, due to their high-profile status.""The chief thought he was doing you two a favor,"" one officer told them, making clear that their privileged position played a role in why they were let go.That same night, St. Louis Alderman Antonio French was also arrested. French has been a non-stop presence at the protests, using Twitter to document the community's response to the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed African American teenager. French's arrest, like those of the two journalists, received a significant amount of attention. Although he had to spend the night in jail, he was eventually released without facing any charges. But French and the two reporters weren't the only ones arrested Wednesday night -- at least 13 other people were picked up as well. Unfortunately for them, they didn't have the benefit of the media spotlight. They had to spend the night in jail, pay bail and were charged with crimes. Their problems will linger for a few weeks, while they await their court dates. Liz Peinado works for French, and she and her coworker Meghan Flannery were waiting at the police station for their boss to be released. Both are alumni of Teach for America and had taught in the school district where Brown had just graduated high school. As on other nights, there were a few dozen people there protesting. The crowd was growing, Peinado said, and people were calling for French's release.Shortly after midnight, a heavily armored Humvee and dozens of officers in full gear showed up and told everyone to leave or be arrested. While most of the crowd dispersed, Peinado told The Huffington Post that she and Flannery decided to stay, sitting on the sidewalk and tweeting what was happening.""I sat down,"" she said, ""legs crossed, one hand in the air holding a peace sign, one hand holding my phone on Twitter.""They decided to leave when the police said it was their ""final warning."" Peinado said they were afraid that the officers were going to spray tear gas, so they went to Flannery's car, accompanied by two other people.Peinado said she was already in the car and Flannery was about to get in when ""at least seven armed"" police officers surrounded them and told them to get out of the vehicle because they were under arrest.""I stand at 4'11"". I'm a tiny woman,"" Peinado said. ""And they're like, 'Get out of the car.' So I'm like, I have a choice: I can probably get manhandled and hope someone is watching this, or get manhandled and no one is ever going to know about it. So I just got out of the car.""They got into a police van and were driven across the street to headquarters, where they spent the night in a jail cell. There were three women in the cell and only one bed. There was also no toilet paper; Peinado had to ask five times before someone provided it.""I wish I could describe how cold it was,"" said Peinado. ""They refused to give us blankets because they said they didn't have any. But it was really cold. Everyone in all of the cells was complaining about it.""Peinado and Flannery were released the next morning on $300 bail each. They were charged with failure to comply with police orders and a noise violation. Umar Lee, a columnist for the St. Louis Evening-Whirl, was also at the protest Wednesday night and was also arrested. He told The Huffington Post that he was charged with the same crimes as Peinado and Flannery.Ryan Frank, a filmmaker, was there as well and faced identical charges. And like Peinado and Flannery, he said he was actually getting up to leave when he was arrested. The St. Louis County Police Department, which was in charge of security in Ferguson at the time, did not return a request for comment. Gov. Jay Nixon (D) relieved them of those duties after intense criticism of their heavy-handed, militaristic response to the protests.Frank posted a video of the arrests on YouTube. Peinado is the woman in denim shirt who gets out of the car, and Lee is shown being handcuffed at the end: Want more updates from Amanda? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth."

Chiquita, owner of the namesake banana label, said it will continue with its planned purchase of Irish competitor Fyffes after rejecting an unsolicited $611 million takeover proposal from Cutrale Group and Safra Group. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb311d23c000032000c47bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Chiquita may be the next major corporation to split from the U.S. to avoid taxes.The banana giant rejected a $625 million buyout bid by Brazilian orange behemoth Cutrale Group and conglomerate Safra Group on Thursday and said it means to go ahead with a planned merger with Irish rival Fyffes. The combined company is then expected to register in low-tax Ireland in what is known as a tax inversion -- essentially renouncing U.S. corporate citizenship.“Chiquita remains committed to completing its transaction with Fyffes, which it believes will create a combined company that is better positioned to succeed in a highly competitive marketplace,” the company said in a statement on Thursday. Chiquita, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., originally inked a deal to acquire Fyffes in March.But a lot has changed since March, with such inversion deals increasingly facing public scorn. Inversions have lately become a political target of several high-ranking lawmakers in Congress. President Barack Obama has considered an executive order to close the tax loophole and said of the practice earlier this month that “it’s not right.” And a week ago, boycott threats forced drugstore-chain operator Walgreen to abandon its plan to re-incorporate in Switzerland after merging with European competitor Alliance Boots in an inversion deal.Chiquita could be the next company to face such a backlash, according to Roger Hickey, the co-director of Campaign for America’s Future, a progressive nonprofit that collected more than 300,000 signatures on a petition against Walgreen. “There will be a strong reaction,” Hickey told The Huffington Post on Friday. “Chiquita brands is very, very well-known, and they could be vulnerable to a boycott as well.” Unlike Walgreen, which stood to save $4 billion over the next five years, Chiquita has said it would receive little immediate benefit from its move to Ireland. But nonprofit tax groups told HuffPost they suspect long-term benefits are driving the inversion deal.“Our sense is Chiquita is hiding something in the deal by not publicly acknowledging and not publicly stating what kind of advantage they’re getting from this,” Frank Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, told HuffPost. “The reason we think they’re doing this is to avoid bad publicity.”Ed Loyd, a spokesman for Chiquita, did not return a call requesting comment. Chiquita also had about $1.7 billion in profits parked offshore last December, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last March. If it pledges allegiance to Ireland’s tricolored flag, it can avoid paying U.S. taxes on that money, Rebecca Wilkins, senior counsel at Citizens for Tax Justice, told HuffPost.“Instead, if they do the inversion transaction,"" she said, ""over time, through fairly complicated legal and accounting maneuvers, they can move that money out of tax-haven subsidiaries to the new parent company and eventually get all of it.”"

And is the U.S. public willing to pour more taxpayer money into a country that cost it billions of dollars and thousands of American lives since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein?""Whatever future military assistance we continue to provide to Iraq won't be tied specifically or solely to the new prime minister,"" said a U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military planning. ""To say that now that there's a new guy it will open the floodgates would be way overstating this.""A second U.S. defense official said the United States would be looking for the next government to integrate the fragmented Iraqi security forces and to provide assistance to the Kurdish minority. But putting a new government program in place will take time, suggesting the measured pace of the administration's response to the Islamic State advance will continue.""If all those conditions start getting set, then I think you will see the possibility of us accepting an invitation to do more substantive train, advise and assist,"" the official said. But if this happens, the official added, it would be slow and may take a year.In the meantime, targeted air strikes and the provision of U.S. military equipment such as Apache helicopters is expected to continue.Obama, who campaigned on promises to end the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has not yet decided how much more U.S. military action or weaponry he might support in Iraq, said a third U.S. official.""We've seen the first press allegations of a slippery slope,"" said this official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. ""So you can be sure that people are concerned about what these next steps mean."" MASSIVE U.S. OUTLAYThe human and financial toll from the 2003 invasion ordered by former President George W. Bush looms heavily over policymakers contemplating what to do next in Iraq.The United States set aside $56.3 billion in aid for Iraq in the decade from fiscal year 2003 to 2012, according to a Congressional Research Service report published last month.Of that total, the Pentagon spent $20.1 billion to support Iraqi security forces, many of whom quickly melted away in the north when faced with Islamic State fighters last month.Overall aid to Iraq, one of the world's most oil-rich nations, dropped dramatically in recent years to about $590 million each in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, and $308.7 million was requested in the fiscal year to Sept. 30, 2015.A fourth U.S. official said the administration was already discussing the kinds of weapons systems Iraqis may need to fight the Islamic State and what more Washington can do to increase Iraqi oil production.U.S. and European Union officials, however, declined to provide details on what they might provide, saying it was too early and suggesting all sides wanted to see how the Abadi government governs.A senior European Union official said on Friday after a meeting in Brussels of EU foreign ministers that there had not yet been any discussion within the bloc of economic support for Abadi's government.""Not yet. It may be a bit too early. It will come later on,"" said the EU official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank said there could be a modest rise in U.S. aid but cited skepticism about the utility of such assistance and about the centrality of Iraq to U.S. national security as a result of the long American involvement in the country.""There can be extensive security assistance, which could be a combination of weapons and training. There can be increased intelligence cooperation. There can be encouragement for U.S. companies to invest in Iraq,"" Alterman said.""But, in very broad terms, the U.S. government has spent most of what it will ever spend on Iraq,"" he added. ""While you may be able to have a tick upward from the current level, it's very hard for me to imagine the kind of close partnership that people had been hoping for five or six years ago.""

They notified the U.S. Marshals Department, which issued an arrest warrant.The suspect, a former resident of Simi Valley, was arrested without incident, according to Simi Valley police. Inside the room was a small quantity of cash and some pizza.He has been transported to the Ventura County Jail, but will eventually go to Las Vegas, the city he fled after the alleged Aug. 8 pummeling of Mack that left her with broken bones, a ruptured liver and diminished eyesight. Mack previously told The Huffington Post what happened and detailed her injuries:At about 2 am Friday morning, Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May, he moved out of my house and back to San Diego. When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me. He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face.Mack also sent photos of her battered body.""I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating,"" Mack said. ""My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in 2 places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.""Mack said she can't chew or see out of her left eye.

He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard.""When Koppenhaver went into the kitchen and left her in a heap on the floor, she escaped by running to a neighbor's house.

For three months of the year, on the remote South Pacific island of Pentecost, Vanuatu, the tradition of land diving takes place. A tower is built from timber and vines collected from the hills around the jump site. Jumping takes place between March and June when the vines are strong. The death defying dives are performed each Saturday, or when tourist cruise ships visit the island throughout these months.They hurl themselves off the platform diving at the solid ground below and are saved only by the vines tied to their ankles which pull them back from the jaws of death inches from the ground. land diver launches himself from the platform with vines tied around his ankles to arrest his fall.

(It is also, now, a spectacle for tourists.) Boys don't only jump into manhood, they literally smack their heads into it.On a recent expedition, National Geographic sent a crew to document the tradition.The “land dive,” as we gawkers have come to know it, is called gol or nagol in the Sa language, which translates to ""the body.""The wooden tower, sometimes 100 feet tall, is built to look like a body, too, according to Jolly:“It has angles, knees, a belly, breasts, shoulders, a head, even genitals. The diving platforms that jut out from the tower are conceived of as the penes, and the struts underneath as the vaginas of the tower. The tower is thus arguably an exuberantly bisexual body, but it is only younger men who dive from it.”NatGeo's Zoltan Istvan reports that the sexual connotations are rooted in the practice since its goal is to produce fertile land and a productive yam harvest. “Historically,"" Istvan says, ""a diver's goal was to bless the soil by skimming the earth with the top of his head.""“But these days the ritual extends far beyond yams -- it underlies the foundation of tribal society in Pentecost. When a boy is ready for manhood, he proves his courage by jumping off the tower in view of his elders. Watching from the ground, the boy's mother holds a favorite item from his childhood. After his first jump, the item is thrown away, signifying he is no longer a child.”Of course, sometimes the vines snap, resulting in broken hips and collarbones. In Istvan’s 2002 report, when a teenager’s vines broke, he smacked face first into the ground. In this video, a vine around a jumper’s left ankle breaks, but he seems relatively unharmed. Since it's taboo for tourists -- or aituristiri -- to participate (we don't know why you would want to), just check out how close one jumper's head comes to the ground in the video below:"

Sometimes people who are dying heal and return home, while their caretakers are the ones who unexpectedly die. Robin Williams' death feels like that to us, he made us laugh and feel hope at our saddest moments, and now he is gone. Williams was our Dr. Patch Adams after all, wasn't he?At moments of crisis it feels like there is no structure in the world, its just pure chaos. Today is one of those moments; today it feels like we are all out of flow.At times of chaos it can be helpful to remember that Buddha found liberation by labeling chaos as simply change. Buddha was a master at understanding reality, and in his scriptures we learn that change is a law of life, a law just like gravity. However, Buddha was also a psychologist, and he was adamant that mindfulness was the only way to overcome the suffering of change, and to bring a sense of serenity and flow during life's greatest hardships.   Flow is the optimal psychology experienced during peak performance that is sought out by athletes, artists, business professionals and day-to-day people to help them feel and perform at their best. However, most people struggle with finding flow consistently - myself certainly included. Yet most of us do have experiences of flow from time to time. They are those light moments when we are in the shower, driving, playing sports, dancing, drinking tea, gardening, talking with a dear friend, or even when we laughed at Patch Adams filling a pool with spaghetti to make that elder ladies dream come true. Moments of flow are liberating because we tend to lose our sense of self-consciousness, and we just do it, or just be. Robin William's helped us just laugh. However, maybe crisis its important that instead of trying to find flow, we simply need to just go with it, that is, to observe how flow is occurring at all times - even during the tragedy of death. In order to experience flow at times of crisis we need to create a fluid stream of consciousness that is structured and ordered; mindfully accepting change helps us to do that. Mindfully observing our thoughts helps us go with the flow because it creates a metaphorical bumper that blocks our thoughts from entering the hopeless depths of ours mind's gutter. As opposed to becoming overly attached to our thoughts, mindful awareness helps us maintain space between our thoughts and our sense of self or consciousness. Because we can observe our thoughts, it means we are not them. This attitude helps us self-regulate our emotions during crisis and it creates the psychological flexibility which empowers us to go with the flow, as opposed to being a victim to previous ways our thoughts, feelings and behavioural choices kept us out of flow.It is paramount that we only focus our efforts on creating flow within our own minds because there is no way we can maintain structure in our external environment. Maintaining a mindful and non-judging awareness of ourselves may be the highest form on intelligence because flow demands us to experience our thoughts, as opposed to efforts to control or fight them. When we judge and do not accept life, we often label our experiences as negative and tell ourselves a story that can immobilize us with fear. Our negative self talk is often the greater obstacle to moving from fear to flow than anything in our exterior environment. Robin William's died on monday, but our negative self-image and the story we tell ourselves about Robin's death can bombard us with self-defeating thoughts 24/7, 365. Like drugs, peak performance is an addictive high that we can become attached to experiencing and feel depressed when we believe we are not in it. I struggle with the ups and downs of life, often hearing judgmental thoughts that I am either in, or out of flow. Mindfulness helps me not avoid life when I feel out of flow, in fact, the very point of living mindfully is to help us ride life's unexpected waves and to continue to go with the flow of life.The tragic death of Robin William's brings to life the fact that until we learn to simply go with the flow, as opposed to constantly trying to find it, we may not have any lasting peace within us. We will miss you Patch, but we must keep moving."
