Since then he has initiated two wars, first in Libya and now in Iraq and Syria, and escalated another, in Afghanistan. Alas, he has demonstrated that it is bad to start wars unnecessarily, but even worse to wage wars foolishly.The administration appears to have lost its collective mind. The president has added ground forces to the battle in Iraq and the military has suggested introducing thousands more. His officials reportedly have decided to focus on overthrowing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the name of fighting the Islamic State.It is hard to know which of these ideas is worse. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel may not have wanted to leave the Pentagon, but he might be lucky having been left at the curb.The U.S. has been back at war in the Middle East for nearly three months. The results have not been pretty. The administration claims to have created a vast coalition of 60 nations, roughly 30 percent of the world's countries. Alas, as in the past the celebrated gaggle assembled by Washington turned out to be mostly a PR stunt. The U.S. accounts for about 770 of the roughly 900 strikes on Iraq and Syria. The Arab states have done little in the air and nothing afoot. Only Iran, which Washington fears almost as much as ISIL, has put boots on the ground.Most flagrantly AWOL is Turkey, which has tolerated radical fighters transiting through and even operating on its territory. Many of the Islamic State's combatants came from Turkey and ISIL has targeted Turkish territory for its caliphate. Yet Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan only cares about the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, once a close friend. And Erdogan expects the U.S. do the job for him.Nor has the administration's scattershot bombing campaign had much effect. Iraq's Baghdad has not fallen. That was never likely, however. Kurdistan's Irbil remains in danger. Syria's Kobani is unconquered but in ruins, and thousands of its residents have fled.The Islamic State quickly adjusted its tactics to minimize the vulnerability of its forces. By one count U.S. strikes have killed 464 Islamic State personnel and 57 fighters for Jabhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda affiliate. However, Washington's intervention helped treble the estimated number of ISIL fighters to as many as 30,000 just a couple weeks into Obama's war. Moderate Syrian rebels, most notably the Harakat al-Hazm and Syrian Revolutionary Front, favored by the administration have been routed in that country's north. Many fighters defected or fled while abandoning their heavy weapons, including TOW anti-tank missiles and BM-21 Grad rockets, provided by Washington. Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken essentially admitted failure: ""Unfortunately, every day there is going to be in some part of Iraq or some part of Syria, a community that is under siege, under attack, and is looking for help. We can't be every place, every time.""The Free Syrian Army, the biggest Western-oriented insurgent group, also is losing fighters, perhaps 3000 in the last few months, largely to al-Nusra. This raises questions about how ""moderate"" the group actually is. In fact, some of Assad's opponents now are criticizing the U.S. Former U.S. ambassador Robert Ford explained: ""they are burning American flags because they think we are helping the regime instead of helping them."" Residents of Raqaa, the ISIL stronghold bombed by American forces, blame Washington for higher food and fuel prices, as well as electricity outages.Iraq's Shiite majority has formed a new government -- handing the Interior Ministry to a hardline Shia faction responsible for past atrocities against Sunni civilians. Reconciliation remains a distant hope. The army has made progress, though as much if not more by bringing in reliable troops from the south and leaning on Iranian assistance as by relying on the U.S.President Obama hasn't even sold his policy to his own aides. One unnamed administration official told CNN: ""It has been pretty clear for some time that supporting the moderate opposition in the hopes of toppling Assad, isn't going to work."" Some four months ago the administration announced that it planned to vet and train ""moderate"" insurgents; as yet not a single Syrian has been approved. Once begun, that process will take three to five months, followed by eight to nine months of training. Thus, it will be at least another year before the first U.S.-backed fighter emerges to do battle. Moreover, reports recently emerged that the Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, long at odds, agreed to stop battling each other. The pact appears to have grown out of a series of informal local ceasefires begun in October and envisions the two radical groups fighting together. The administration's plan for the ""moderates"" to defeat this strengthened radical axis and the Syrian government looks ever more fantastic.Through everything the Islamic State is unbowed, accepting recruits, raising funds, slaughtering opponents, and launching attacks. The administration appears to have created its own variant of the infamous quagmire: continuing, desultory warfare with little effect other than to suck America deeper into sectarian strife. At the same time Washington is relieving Arab nations of the need to act in their own defense and making ever more enemies by intervening yet again in someone else's quarrel. The Islamic State's Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi responded to the U.S. campaign with a call to ""erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere.""So the administration apparently is rethinking its policy. And preparing to make everything worse. The president already has doubled U.S. boots on the ground, sending in another 1500 advisers to Iraq. Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated in September that as many as 15,000 U.S. troops might be needed for ""a ground component to the campaign"" to retake Iraqi and Syrian territory seized by ISIL. Last week he said that the administration was considering sending American personnel to cooperate with Iraqi troops in the battle for Mosul and to guard that nation's border. As yet he didn't ""foresee a circumstance when it would be in our interest to take this fight on ourselves with a large military contingent."" However, if, as is likely, the administration's latest escalation has little effect, the administration will be under greater pressure with fewer options. Already this is as much America's as Iraq's war, even though the Islamic State did not threaten the U.S. And Baghdad holds the key to defeating ISIL: either reconcile with or free Iraq's Sunnis. The majority Shia must give the Sunni tribes and former Baathists who don't want to live in the 7th century -- the great majority of the population of Mosul and elsewhere in Anbar Province -- an incentive to confront the Islamic State. (Either federalism or independence would work.) But Baghdad has little incentive to do so if it believes the U.S. will do the fighting instead.Equally foolish, administration officials reportedly want to shift their focus to wrecking the most competent military force opposing ISIL: the Syrian army. While escalating the conflict Obama officials have declared the Iraq-first approach to be ""untenable."" True, but not because America is not doing more. Baghdad holds the key in Iraq, while policy in Syria is internally inconsistent. Alistair Baskey, spokesman for the National Security Council, explained: ""Alongside our efforts to isolate and sanction the Assad regime, we are working with our allies to strengthen the moderate opposition."" The first is the strongest opponent of the Islamic State, while the latter spends most of its time attacking the first. The president should not expect this policy to defeat anyone.Yet the administration apparently is moving toward a Syria first strategy, based on the ouster of President Assad. Proposed steps include accelerating aid to the ""moderates"" and establishing a no-fly zone along the Turkey-Syria border. Rep. Ed Royce (R-Ca.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he understood the proposal to be at least in part a response to pressure from Turkey and the Gulf States, which have funded radical forces in Syria against Assad and expect Washington to protect them from their folly. On the record administration officials speak of a reappraisal as part of a constant review process.Focusing on Damascus would be twice stupid. First, it would mean essentially doubling down on the policy of supporting the weakest faction in Syria, whose members have been defecting to the radicals. Second, it would entail targeting what today is the strongest force resisting the Islamic State. A ""moderate"" victory against both jihadist and government forces is the least likely outcome. Far more likely, U.S.-supplied insurgents would weaken the Assad regime, perhaps enough to contribute to an ISIL/al-Nusra victory. Then the fun would really start, perhaps with mass beheadings in Damascus.One reason Americans elected President Obama was their belief that he had learned from the Bush administration's foolish misadventure in Iraq. That hope faded when the president launched his own war against Libya's Moammar Qaddafy, which also had disastrous consequences. Now it appears that Sen. Obama's famous speech denouncing the Iraq invasion reflected partisanship rather than prescience. Barack Obama no less than George W. Bush believes in trying to bring peace to the Mideast through war.The Islamic State is evil, but until now it was not interested in terrorizing Americans. Rather, ISIL's raison d'etre was establishing a Middle Eastern caliphate, or quasi-state, from the territory of several Middle Eastern countries which have large armies and para-militaries, and competent air forces. The administration used the tragic but limited plight of the Yazidi people as an excuse to micro-manage an entire conflict-filled region. As a result, the Obama policy could end up sacrificing the lives, wealth, and security of Americans for years to come.Like a second marriage, Washington's latest Middle Eastern excursion represents the triumph of hope over experience. It is hard to point to a military intervention in the broader region which has worked well: Lebanon in 1983, Iraq almost continuously since 1990, Somalia in 1992, Afghanistan for more than 13 years starting in 2001, Libya in 2011. Other forms of meddling have been scarcely more successful: drone warfare in Pakistan and Yemen, decades of financial, military, and diplomatic backing for Egypt, destruction of Iranian democracy in 1953, dismissal of Saudi-backed suppression of Bahrain's Shia majority by its Sunni monarchy, and tepid support for Syria's insurgents. Virtually every U.S. action has resulted in a worse reaction, including by al-Qaeda and now the Islamic State -- the latter but one of many ill consequences of the Iraq invasion.Despite this extraordinary record, the administration would have us believe that it can simultaneously destroy ISIL, rid Iraq of sectarianism, replace Bashar al-Assad with a Syrian Thomas Jefferson, contain Iranian influence, and convince a gaggle of hostile Middle Eastern states to work together to further America's ends. The administration admits that it's been tough going so far, but all we need to do now apparently is put more ground forces into Iraq and better target Assad. President Obama told Americans in explaining his policy toward the Islamic State: ""Keep in mind that this is something that we know how to do."" Very badly. It's time he and others in Washington learned from past mistakes, which are almost too many to be numbered. The first may be the most serious: the belief that the U.S. can transcend religion, history, ethnicity, tradition, politics, and geography and ""fix"" the Middle East. America can't. It's time to give up trying to do so.This post was first published in Forbes online."

It is time for white Americans to stop shaming and to speak out against the killing of black children.",2014-11-30,"FERGUSON, MO - NOVEMBER 24: Lesley McSpadden (L), mother of Michael Brown, reacts to the decision by the Grand Jury not to indict Officer Daren Wilson in the shooting death of her son, in Ferguson, Missouri on November 24, 2014. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8df18220000bb01dd7eb1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"All day people gathered, waiting, daring to hope, that maybe this time black lives would matter. Minutes passed. Then hours. And, as darkness descended on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, the now enormous crowd continued to wait patiently -- trying its best to remain optimistic. Perhaps, despite so many decades of history, black people really could find justice in the American legal system.That such a faith still flickered was, itself, remarkable. Everyone standing outside of the Ferguson police station awaiting news on whether the grand jury would indict police officer Darren Wilson well remembered what happened on February 26, 2012 when Trayvon Martin was killed. Nothing. They also had noticed that, though Martin's killer went free, in the very same state, black mother Marissa Alexander was sentenced to 20 years in prison merely for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. And, of course, they had just heard, only two days earlier, that yet another black child, this time 12-year-old Tamir Rice, had also been shot to death by the police.But having faith and clinging to hope is what it means to be human. Even when the past, as well as most recent present, tell people that optimism is wholly unfounded and that they should be realists not romantics, somehow they still believe.And then they don't. At 9:00 p.m. on November 24, 2014, St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch stepped to the podium and explained -- in fact, explained better than most any defense attorney ever could -- why Darren Wilson would not, and in fact, should not, be indicted for killing unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown on August 9, 2014. Hope then became despair. And despair then became all-consuming and almost impossible to contain. For some it took the form of uncontrollable sobs. For others it was expressed through screams. And for still others it erupted in smashing and burning things inanimate. In its various articulations, though, it was a despair that would fill any parent's heart, and spread like fire through any parent's veins, if their child had been shot to death and no one cared. And yet too many Americans -- overwhelmingly white Americans -- didn't remotely recognize, let alone understand, Ferguson's despair. Why? Because, at the end day, they don't see this nation's black children -- its Trayvon's, Michael's, and Tamir's -- as their children. Indeed they find it hard to see black children as children at all.But while so much of white America couldn't relate to the utter anguish of Ferguson's black community it certainly worried mightily about how community members might react to the news that Michael Brown's killer would not face trial. This reaction, whites knew, could be potentially disruptive to both privilege and power. And so they tried to contain this torment with tanks and tear gas. And, when even these military measures couldn't keep people from expressing their grief, and indeed only deepened their misery, these same white Americans began the shaming process. They began wondering publicly, shaking their heads most disapprovingly, why blacks can't express their feelings more suitably, in a more appropriate way. They wished, loudly, for this grief to be less raw. They called for it to be far more civil. They desired it be expressed with greater decorum. But this kind of distress, parental yet powerless, can't possibly be proper or polite. It is perpetually provoked, it is historically-bound, and, thus, it is bone-deep. This is a desolation born of the fact that we remain, and have always been, a nation in which only some parents, specifically the parents of America's black and brown children, must continually suffer loss with no justice. From the parents of Emmett Till, to the parents of Medgar Evers, to the parents of Rodney King, to the parents of Sean Bell, to the parents of Yvette Smith, to the parents of countless other African Americans, justice is rarely served and, therefore, black pain and sorrow are ever-present. To be sure, since white Americans haven't experienced this long history of being terrorized by racist mobs and, today, don't live in continuous fear of having their sons and daughters felled by police bullets, this ever-present pain may indeed be difficult to grasp. But for them to imagine it to be illogical or irrational is, in fact, more devastating to the future of this country than any on-the-ground expression of black distress could ever be. After all, it is this sort of dismissal of palpable pain -- a blindness and coldness to black humanity -- that has caused so much trauma and tension in the first place. Indeed, if this nation ever hopes to make good on the promise of ""justice for all,"" and if it has any hope of actually giving every person in this country a rational reason to believe in the future, then America's white people must reckon with their own power and privilege. In fact, white people in this country are very well-aware that their kids are not assumed to be criminals as they walk down the street. They also well know that their kid's skin color alone means they are unlikely to be shot to death by the police -- even if they are suspected of committing a crime. And, here is the real point: were their children to be unarmed and yet killed with impunity, America's whites would be sobbing, smashing and, yes, screaming for justice. And, so... it is time for white Americans to stop shaming and to speak out against the killing of black children too."

Every morning, an hour before dawn, troops would be roused from wherever they had managed to bed down by the order to ""stand to."" Clambering stiffly to their feet, the troops would check that their rifles were loaded, fix bayonets and climb up on the fire step. This was a step cut into the trench wall two or three feet above the ground enabling soldiers to peer towards the enemy lines. It was a fact of Great War life that attacks were usually mounted at dawn, despite the fact that both sides knew the enemy would be prepared to face an assault by the ""stand to"" order.It was another fact of life that ""stand to"" would be accompanied by another ritual - the morning-hate. This was the opportunity to alleviate some of the early morning tension, and perhaps catch a dawn raid on the hop, by firing off some rifle or machine gun rounds in the direction of the enemy lines.In the British army after ""stand to"", as well as in most Commonwealth armies, a rum ration might be issued, and then the men would start the important task of cleaning their rifles. Officers would carry out rifle inspection immediately before the equally important matter of breakfast was attended to. A peculiar feature of the Great War was the observation by both sides, in many places, of an unofficial breakfast truce. As long as officers didn't stamp down on the practice, the morning meal could be taken in comparative peace and quiet. German Machine Gun Emplacement overlooking No-Mans-Land, Flanders 1916The day would continue with inspection of the troops by a company or platoon commander and the assignment of chores by a non-commissioned officer. The tasks were typically mundane, but usually essential: perhaps duckboards on the trench floors needed repair; maybe trenches had to be drained; trench walls might need to be shored up before they collapsed; sandbags might need to be refilled; latrines might have to be dug. Non-commissioned officers were capable of dreaming up a million little jobs, to fill the troops' time.Nevertheless, notwithstanding an NCOs' imaginations, boredom played a big part in trench life. There couldn't be much movement until night fell, given the presence of snipers in the enemy lines, and the daylight hours between chores had to be filled somehow. This was the time for a few minutes of gratefully snatched sleep or for writing home. Otherwise, there would be long stretches of idle time. As night fell, the morning ritual of ""stand to"" would be repeated. At night, under cover of darkness, the men got busy. Some would be assigned to sentry duty of up to two hours on the fire step. Woe to any man who let his fatigue get the better of him. The penalty for falling asleep on sentry duty was execution by firing squad.Otherwise, soldiers might be told to fetch rations and water from the rear lines or undertake further maintenance of the trenches. The hazardous job of barbed wire repair in no-man's land was reserved for nighttime. Men might also be assigned to listening posts or simply be sent out on patrol beyond the front line. Sometimes a patrol might meet an enemy group on a sortie from their own lines. When that happened the options were either to fight hand-to-hand or simply get out of the way. Firing at your enemy in this situation was suicidal. It would immediately attract indiscriminate machine gun fire from both sides. The hours of darkness also provided an opportunity for men to be relieved of their front-line duty and rotated to rear areas.In many locations there would be near-constant bombardment from the enemy artillery. Snipers were omnipresent. Many a new man on the front line also learned the hard way that snipers were ready at all times to punish those foolhardy enough to peer carelessly above the parapet.Then there was the animal life, which prospered in the fetid atmosphere of the trenches. The most feared beasts were the rats. They were simply everywhere, numbering millions. These animals seldom went hungry because of the ready availability of human corpses, and they could grow to the size of a cat. They spread disease and they contaminated food. Men tried in desperation, but without success, to diminish the rats' burgeoning populations: clubbing them, stamping on them, stabbing them with bayonets, and shooting them. German Soldiers with RatsThere were other vermin to contend with. Lice were just as impossible to get rid of as rats. Even when infested clothing was washed and deloused, lice left their eggs in the seams, waiting for a soldier's body heat to spur them to hatch. It was not until 1918 that lice were identified as the cause of another hazard - trench fever, an ailment that brought with it severe pain and high fever. Recovery took men away from the trenches for up to twelve weeks.In wet, unsanitary trenches, the nasty fungal condition of trench foot was a constant threat. Affected feet could turn gangrenous, necessitating amputation. And then there was the ever-present irritant of nits. Many men chose to shave their heads to control the little beasts. Soldiers Picking Lice from their ClothesFinally, not least of the curses of trench life was the smell. The foul odor of unwashed bodies, rotting corpses, overflowing latrines, stagnant mud, cordite, poison gas and rotting sandbags was unforgettable. In the end, the advent of the new ""industrial warfare"" of the 20th century would make the trench warfare largely obsolete. Against tanks and planes, not to mention poison gas and flamethrowers, the concept of trench warfare would join that of cavalry as an artifact of a bygone time."

Missouri's governor ordered hundreds more state militia into the St. Louis suburb, Ferguson, Tuesday after a night of protests and rioting over a grand jury decision's not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the killing of Michael Brown, a case that has inflamed racial tensions in the U.S. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dee33c000018010dfbbf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The events in Ferguson point to a deep divide in our society and the justified fear that keeps it in place. Minority groups feel targeted, and rightly so. Police feel unfairly targeted, and rightly so. The targeted minorities and their allies react naturally -- they want to lash out -- at the police, the prosecutors and the system that treats them so poorly. Then the police, and those who they protect, want take the protesters to task for treating these heroes with such contempt. And they are especially disdainful of lawless rioters, who undermine the very system that keeps ""us"" safe. In turn, the minorities and their allies shake their heads in disgust at a system that keeps some people much safer than others.Our collective rage is focused on the specifics in Ferguson, and the specifics matter a lot. A young man lost his life. An officer may have nearly lost his. He may be facing unfair criticism. Or he may be getting away with murder. The system may be rigged and this might be a classic example. Or not. These events are deeply important.But the furor is about more than these tragic characters and their story. The nation is erupting in protest, and the protesters are facing batons and tear gas because this is just one example of thousands of lives lost and others ruined in an endless conflict between social and political enemies. The causes are many -- violence, poverty, oppression and blame, to name a few. But underneath it all lies fear. This legitimate fear fuels a conflict that burns so bright that we can't even see that the other side is driven by exactly the same thing. Everyone is afraid. We mask it with anger and indignation, but let's fess up, we are afraid. Those who benefit from our powerful police state tend see protest as ungrateful and rioting as dangerous. And they are right to defend the rule of law, because it is an essential pillar for safety and human thriving and its disappearance would be terrifying. But those who are terrorized by that state are right to be afraid of it too -- to lash out the law as lawless because it is applied unevenly. We may be a nation of laws, not men, but those laws are written and enforced by men and women who are blinded by prejudice and subject to their own fears too -- just like all of us. There are a lot of policies that could improve the situation. Some, like cameras worn by police officers, are obvious. Some continue to elude us -- like how to improve opportunities for minorities. But to heal this festering wound, we must also change the way we interact. The only way to do this is stop hyperventilating with fear, even though our fear is completely justified. I don't pretend to be neutral in this conversation. I think one side here has much more to fear than the other. And you might think so too, but you might disagree with me about whom. And that disagreement matters. The truth matters. The justice and injustice of it matters, deeply. My beliefs about this make me want to scream. But my screaming isn't going to help our children -- black children, white children, the children of police officers. Or anyone else for that matter.In fact, the more we try to win these kinds of battles against our political enemies, the more we lose the real war -- the one against living in fear. Our battling hardens our positions, which draws out the conflict and increases the damage to each side. If one side gets the upper hand, the other becomes more desperate and will worker harder to inflict damage. That is what is happening because of Ferguson right now. Each side scores a victory in the battle against the other, and both are losing the war against fear.There is only one sure weapon against fear. It is love. ""Love your enemies,"" Jesus said, on a hillside in Palestine 2000 years ago. It fell on deaf ears then, just as it does now -- in Palestine, the U.S., and everywhere else. It's irrational and it's impossibly hard. But we have a few famous examples like Martin Luther King, Jr., and Gandhi who got close. And they have been some of our greatest generals in the war against fear. Love can win the day because this is not a just a war against our enemies, it is a war against ourselves. We cannot overcome fear with strength. The most extreme attempts at this like Fascist Germany and Soviet Russia created paranoid, terrifying societies. Only empathy, which is the root of morality, can bring victory. And that is only possible when we love one another. If we want to understand the fears of our sisters and brothers we have to love some actual people deeply enough to know them as sisters and brothers and empathize with their fears. That means getting out and building relationships with people radically different than us -- economically, relationally, vocationally, politically. Only when we feel their fears alongside ours, and they feel ours alongside theirs, can we begin to bridge this great gulf in our nation. This deeper reality is why another biblical writer wrote that ""perfect love drives out all fear."" And it is why we must set aside our justified fear if we ever want to win the war against it."

Natural spring water flows from the site.  A point of contention for decades, authorities on the island agreed this year to cooperate on a restoration following warnings by experts that the structure could soon collapse.""This shrine is important for all Cypriots.

The United Nations Development Programme is overseeing the project.Cypriots have been making the pilgrimage to Apostolos Andreas -- which is closer to Syria, 60 miles (100 km)across the Mediterranean, than to the island's capital Nicosia, a three-hour trip by road -- for centuries.Served by a lone priest for 40 years, the monastery's isolation is evident; feral but friendly donkeys besiege visitors, begging for scraps of food.Wax statues -- votive offerings known as ""tamata"" in Greek Orthodox culture -- are common in the complex and usually signify a prayer to heal illness.While mainly Orthodox Christian Greek and Muslim Turkish Cypriots share many common traditions, Apostolos Andreas is the one site where religious boundaries are blurred.""This is not only part of Greek Cypriot cultural heritage but Turkish Cypriot cultural heritage too,"" said Ali Tuncay, co-chair of the cultural heritage team. ""It's very important to us. Many Turkish Cypriots come here to make a wish."""

Amid the fallout from a grand jury's decision in the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Missouri, a panel in New York City is quietly nearing its own conclusion about another combustible case involving the death of an unarmed man at the hands of police. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c45d260000360080b3d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TOM HAYS, Associated PressNEW YORK (AP) — Amid the fallout from a grand jury's decision in the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Missouri, a panel in New York City is quietly nearing its own conclusion about another combustible case involving the death of an unarmed man at the hands of police.The grand jury that began investigating the chokehold death of Eric Garner in September heard last week from what was believed to be its final witness — the New York Police Department officer seen on a widely watched amateur video showing him wrapping his arm around Garner's neck. Before the end of the year, authorities are expected to announce whether the officer will face criminal charges in a case that sparked outrage and grabbed headlines before it was overshadowed by the killing of Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.The Garner video — along with a medical examiner's finding that the chokehold contributed to his death on the streets of Staten Island — should give a grand jury ample reason to indict, said Garner's mother, Gwen Carr.""You'd have to be blind to not see what happened,"" Carr said in a telephone interview. ""I can't see why it should take so long to reach a decision. ... The wait is making me very anxious, of course. But there's nothing I can do about it.""Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan, who has control over the timing of a grand jury vote and an announcement, has declined to comment. But New York City authorities say they're already taking steps to avoid a repeat of the violent protests in Ferguson.The NYPD sent detectives to Missouri to gather intelligence on ""professional agitators"" who frequent protests and to share strategies for quelling violence, said Police Commissioner William Bratton. Police also have kept in touch with community leaders on Staten Island to coordinate the response to the grand jury decision.""We're always and constantly networking and trying to make ourselves accessible and reaching out,"" Bratton said.The Garner case stems from a July 17 confrontation between Officer Daniel Pantaleo and other NYPD officers who stopped him on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. The video shot by an onlooker shows the 43-year-old Garner, who was black, telling the officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed.Pantaleo, who is white, responded by putting Garner in an apparent chokehold, which is banned under NYPD policy. The heavyset Garner, who had asthma, is heard gasping, ""I can't breathe."" He later was pronounced dead at a hospital.The medical examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide caused in part by the chokehold. But police union officials and Pantaleo's lawyer have argued that the officer used a takedown move taught by the police department, not a chokehold, and that Garner's poor health was the main reason he died.As in the Brown case, which involved a black 18-year-old and a white officer, Garner's family sought intervention by federal prosecutors. Carr and others met several weeks ago with U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch — the nominee to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder — whose office covers Staten Island. Lynch hasn't commented.""She just said that they were keeping an eye on the case,"" Carr said. ""It gave me something to hold onto.""Some demonstrators at a recent Brooklyn protest organized in respond to the Ferguson case said they expected a similar outcome in New York.""I wouldn't be surprised if another cop got off,"" said 15-year-old Gramal Ralph, who's black. ""I would hope that we could get justice here, but I don't have faith in the system anymore.""___Associated Press writer Colleen Long contributed to this report."

(AP) — A federal judge in Connecticut has rejected the arguments of a home invasion killer on death row who complained that the food he is being served in prison is not kosher.Steven Hayes, convicted of killing a mother and two daughters, sued the Department of Correction in August, alleging the preparation practices for kosher meals in the kitchen at the state's highest-security prison do not conform to Jewish dietary laws.Hayes describes himself in the lawsuit as an Orthodox Jew and says he's been requesting a kosher diet since May 2013. He says he has suffered ""almost two years of emotional injury from having to choose between following God and starving or choosing sin to survive.""Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky were sentenced to die for the 2007 murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela, at the family's home in Cheshire. The victims were tied up, two of them were sexually assaulted and their bodies were found after the home was set on fire. Hawke-Petit's husband, Dr. William Petit, was severely beaten, but survived.U.S. District Court Judge Alvin Thompson, in a ruling dated Tuesday, rejected Hayes' motions for a hearing and a temporary injunction.The judge noted that Hayes is offered kosher meals, and the state Department of Correction has two rabbis who periodically monitor the preparation of kosher foods in the prison system. The judge said both rabbis certified that the food and the food preparation process comply with dietary laws.""Although (Hayes) raises as an issue the lack of a reliable orthodox certificate or an onsite Jewish overseer, he provides no evidence suggesting that their absence leads to a finding that the meals are not kosher,"" the judge wrote.Thompson did not throw out the lawsuit. But in rejecting the motions, he found there is not a likelihood that it will succeed.In a handwritten amended complaint filed this month, Hayes said he hasn't eaten anything he considers to be nonkosher since Aug. 24 and now weighs less than 120 pounds. State prison documents show the 5-foot-7 Hayes weighed 170 pounds in 2007.Karen Martucci, a spokeswoman for the Correction Department, said this month that Hayes has denied to prison officials that he is on a hunger strike.Hayes also alleges he has been the subject of other religious discrimination in prison and was placed on a suicide watch for observing a fast during the Yom Kippur holiday last year.This is not his first lawsuit against the department. In past litigation, none of which have been successful, Hayes has complained about his mental health care, harassment from prison staff and the temperature in his cell.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

LOUIS, MO - NOVEMBER 18: AP Honors students are creating installation art honoring Micael Brown and the town of Ferguson during art class at Riverview Gardens High School on Tuesday, November 18, 2014, in St. Louis, MO. These hands holding cell phones signifies how social media helps spread the news of Michael Brown's shooting and its aftermath. The shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, captivated the nation as a grand jury deliberates to decide whether to charge the officer with a crime. Among those most affected by the ongoing unrest are the thousands of high school students in Greater St. Louis, for reasons that include their physical proximity, Browns age. He had just finished summer school classes for his high school diploma days before the shooting. The way this story has existed in the social media worlds where American teens spend hours each day keeps them connected to and in-tuned with the story. The art instructor, Leah Westerfield, wrote, 'Our Superintendent, Dr. Scott Spurgeon, our community Alderwoman Ms Tia Wells, and Assistant Superintendent, Mrs.Tamera Granger stood at my classroom door the Monday afternoon after Michael Brown's death. They asked the eleven talented AP Honors Student Class to create a mural for Peace. The eleven students sat in suspension as the class decision was made to move forward. We sat quietly in a daze at the task. The mural will be 50 feet by 8 feet tall in 14 panels. Upon completion, the mural will be displayed on tour and finally rest in the Ferguson Community. We are hoping to have a panoramic photograph for posturing the mural and a 3 copy documentary of it's making. An art display will accompany it's first reveal.'

And it's roiling communities across the nation.In early November, school officials in Orinda, California, hired a private detective to determine whether a seven-year-old Latina named Vivian -- whose single mother works as a live-in nanny for a family in Orinda -- ""resides"" in the district and should therefore be allowed to attend the elementary school she's already been attending there.On the basis of that investigation they determined that Vivian's legal residence is her grandmother's home in Bay Point, California. They've given the seven-year-old until December 5 to leave the Orinda elementary school.Never mind that Vivian and her mother live during the workweek at the Orinda home where Vivian's mother is a nanny, that Vivian has her own bedroom in that home with her clothing and toys and even her own bathroom, that she and her mother stock their own shelves in the refrigerator and kitchen cupboard of that Orinda home, or that Vivian attends church with her mother in Orinda and takes gym and youth theater classes at the Orinda community center.The point is Vivian is Latina and poor, and Orinda is white, Anglo, and wealthy.And Orinda vigilantly protects itself from encroachments from the large and growing poor Latino and Hispanic populations living beyond its borders.Orinda's schools are among the best in California - public schools that glean extra revenues from a local parcel tax (that required a two-thirds vote to pass) and parental contributions to the Educational Foundation of Orinda which ""suggests"" donations of $600 per child.Orinda doesn't want to pay for any kids who don't belong there. Harold Frieman, Orinda's district attorney, says the district has to be ""preserving the resources of the district for all the students.""Which is why it spends some of its scare dollars on private detectives to root out children like Vivian.The bigger story is this. Education is no longer just a gateway into the American middle class. Getting a better education than almost everyone else is the gateway into the American elite.That elite is now receiving almost all the economy's gains. So the stakes continue to rise for upscale parents who want to give their kids that better education.The competition starts before Kindergarten and is becoming more intense each year. After all, the Ivy League has only a limited number of places. Parents who can afford it are frantically seeking to get their children into highly regarded private schools.Or they're moving into towns like Orinda, with excellent public schools.Such schools are ""public"" in name only. Tuition payments are buried inside high home prices, extra taxes, parental donations, and small armies of parental volunteers. These parents are intent on policing the boundaries, lest a child whose parents haven't paid the ""tuition"" reap the same advantages as their own child. Hell hath no fury like an upscale parent who thinks another kid is getting an unfair advantage by sneaking in under the fence.The other part of this larger story is that a growing number of kids on the other side of the fence are Hispanic, Latino, and African American. Most babies born in California are now minorities. The rest of the nation isn't far behind. According to the 2010 census, Orinda is 82.4 percent white and 11.4 percent Asian. Only 4.6 percent of its inhabitants are Hispanic or Latino, of any race. All of its elementary schools get 10 points on the GreatSchools 10-point rating system.Bay Point, where Vivian's grandmother lives, is 41.4 percent white, 54.9 percent Hispanic or Latino of any race, and 11.6 percent African America. Bay Point's elementary schools are rated 2 to 4 on GreatShools' 10-point scale.Many of the people who live in places like Bay Point tend the gardens and care for the children of the people who live in places like Orinda. But Orinda is intent on patrolling its border.The nation's attention is focused on the border separating the United States from Mexico, and on people who have crossed that border and taken up residence here illegally.But the boundary separating white Anglo upscale school districts from the burgeoning non-white and non-Anglo populations in downscale communities is fast becoming a flashpoint inside America.In both cases, the central question is who are ""we.""

According to photos from TMZ, Busta got up from the crowd with a bloody forehead and was ushered off the dance floor by security guards.The rapper is okay though, tweeting that he was ""super good"" on Friday. Busta took to Twitter to say that when you're ""passionate about winning u go hard"" and attributed his fall to how good the song ""Coco"" is. After all, Busta has always had that mentality since his 2001 song ""Break Ya Neck.""Watch a video of the fall below.For more, head to TMZ."

(AP Photo/St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Cristina Fletes-Boutte, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8df0b3c000018010dfbc9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You know the fix is in when a suspect who shot an unarmed man voluntarily provides four hours of un-cross examined testimony to a grand jury without taking the Fifth.On August 9, Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson gunned down 18-year-old African American Michael Brown. Since that fateful day, people across the country have protested against racial profiling, excessive police force, and the failure of the criminal justice system to provide accountability.The nail in the coffin of ""equal justice under law"" came on November 24, when the St. Louis County grand jury refused to indict Wilson for any criminal charges in the shooting death of Brown. In a virtually unprecedented move, St. Louis Prosecutor Robert McCulloch in effect deputized the grand jurors to sit as triers of fact as in a jury trial.In a normal grand jury proceeding, the prosecutor presents evidence for a few days and then asks the grand jurors to return an indictment, which they nearly always do. Of 162,000 federal cases in 2010, grand juries failed to indict in only 11 of them, according the Bureau of Justice Statistics.The standard of proof for a grand jury to indict is only probable cause to believe the suspect committed a crime. It is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which is required for conviction at trial. Yet McCulloch's team presented testimony and documents to the panel for three months, evidence not subjected to adversarial testing by cross-examination.Justice Antonin Scalia explained the function of the grand jury in United States v. Williams as follows:[I]t is the grand jury's function not 'to enquire . . . upon what foundation [the charge may be] denied,' or otherwise to try the suspect's defenses, but only to examine 'upon what foundation [the charge] is made' by the prosecutor. [citations omitted] As a consequence, neither in this country nor in England has the suspect under investigation by the grand jury ever been thought to have a right to testify or to have exculpatory evidence presented.Every principle Scalia cited was violated in this case. The grand jury was asked to determine whether Wilson acted in self-defense. Wilson was allowed to give four hours of self-serving testimony to the grand jury. And for three months, prosecutors presented both incriminating and exculpatory evidence.The prosecutor did not ask these grand jurors for an indictment. They were left to sift through the evidence on their own, with no prosecutorial guidance about what to charge. Indeed, the transcripts indicated that prosecutors asked Wilson gentle, leading questions designed to bolster his self-defense claim. For example, a prosecutor told Wilson, ""You felt like your life was in jeopardy,"" followed by, ""And use of deadly force was justified at that point, in your opinion?"" But prosecutors rigorously challenged witnesses who contradicted Wilson's testimony.As the grand jury is a secret proceeding, with only the grand jurors and the prosecutor present, the grand jurors did not hear any cross-examination of the officer's testimony, or that of other witnesses (which is customary in an adversarial jury trial). These grand jurors, who were nearing the end of their term, which began in May, knew the drill, since they had sat on several other cases. They knew the prosecutor always asks for indictments. Thus, when the prosecutor handled the Wilson case in a radically different manner, this signaled to the grand jurors that they were not expected to indict. And they did not.Another unorthodox aspect of this case was McCulloch's announcement of the grand jury's decision on national television. Sounding like a defense attorney delivering a closing argument in a jury trial, McCulloch characterized and analyzed the witness testimony in the light most favorable to the officer.McCulloch has a history of bias in favor of police involved in altercations with black men. But, ignoring the pleas of 7,000 residents in and near Ferguson who signed a petition, McCulloch refused to recuse himself in the Wilson case.McCulloch had mischaracterized testimony in a 2000 case in which two black men were killed after officers fired 21 shots at them. As in the Wilson case, the reasonableness of the officers' use of deadly force was critical. In the 2000 case, the officers said the two victims were driving toward them, trying to run them down, and McCulloch claimed that all the witnesses corroborated the officers' story. A later federal investigation, however, determined that the car was not moving forward, and that only three of the thirteen officers said the car was moving forward.Likewise, Wilson's claim that Brown was ""charging"" at him when the officer fired the fatal shots into the top of Brown's bowed head was critical to the reasonableness of Wilson's use of deadly force. When McCulloch announced the grand jury's decision, he characterized the witnesses who testified that Brown was ""charging"" the officer as believable, but dismissed the testimony of witnesses who said Brown was surrendering. McCulloch sounded like a defense attorney, not a prosecutor charged with representing ""the people,"" including Brown.Wilson fired 12 shots at Brown, six of which struck the teenager. There was a great deal of contradiction among the witnesses, including whether Brown's hands were up or down when Wilson shot at him. That is precisely why there should have been an indictment and a jury trial. Jurors would hear all of the evidence, subjected to adversarial testing by cross-examination. They would assess the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether Wilson had committed any crime(s) beyond a reasonable doubt.After reviewing the transcripts and evidence in the Wilson case, San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi noted:Dorian Johnson, the key witness who was standing next to Brown during the encounter, provided strong testimony that called into question Wilson's claim that he was defending his life against a deranged aggressor. Johnson testified that Wilson, enraged that the young men did not obey his order to get on the sidewalk, threw his patrol car into reverse. While Wilson claimed Brown prevented him from opening his door, Johnson testified that the officer smacked them with the door after nearly hitting the pair. Johnson described the ensuing struggle as Wilson attempting to pull Brown through the car window by his neck and shirt, and Brown pulling away. Johnson never saw Brown reach for Wilson's gun or punch the officer. Johnson testified that he watched a wounded Brown partially raise his hands and say, 'I don't have a gun' before being fatally shot.Adachi also wrote, ""Prosecutors never asked Wilson why he did not attempt to drive away while Brown was allegedly reaching through his vehicle window or to reconcile the contradiction between his claim that Brown punched the left side of his face and the documented injuries which appear on his right side.""If properly directed, the grand jury may well have indicted Wilson for one of several offenses, including first degree murder, second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, assault with a deadly weapon, unlawful discharge of a firearm, and battery. Wilson testified that he was acting in self-defense when he shot Brown. If he were indicted, the jury would assess whether Wilson acted reasonably when he used deadly force against the teenager.A police officer in Missouri can use deadly force in making an arrest or preventing escape if he reasonably believes it is necessary to effect the arrest and also reasonably believes the person to be arrested has committed or attempted to commit a felony, or may otherwise endanger life or inflict serious physical injury unless arrested without delay. The key word is ""reasonably."" The jury would be told to consider whether a deadly weapon was used, how far apart Wilson was from Brown when the former used deadly force, any disparities in the sizes of the two, the crime involved, etc. The evidence was contradictory about the distance between the two during the confrontation, both Wilson and Brown were the same height but Brown was heavier, and the officer contradicted himself about whether he knew that Brown was suspected of committing petty theft for stealing cigarillos (a misdemeanor, not a felony) before the officer stopped him.In Tennessee v. Garner, the Supreme Court held that an officer cannot arrest an unarmed felony suspect by shooting him dead. If the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon, or there is probable cause to believe he has committed a crime involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm, deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape. Although there is a dispute about whether Wilson knew that Brown was suspected of stealing cigarillos before stopping him, Brown had likely committed petty theft -- a non-violent misdemeanor, not a felony.Wilson's testimony raises several questions, listed in a piece by Ezra Klein on Vox: Why did Michael Brown, an 18-year-old kid headed to college, refuse to move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk? Why would he curse out a police officer? Why would he attack a police officer? Why would he dare a police officer to shoot him? Why would he charge a police officer holding a gun? Why would he put his hand in his waistband while charging, even though he was unarmed?In my opinion, McCulloch should have filed charges against Wilson, who would then have had the right to a public preliminary hearing. He could present evidence and cross-examine the witnesses against him. And if it were televised, the viewing public could see that justice is done.According to Adachi, Wilson's description of Brown as a 'demon' with superhuman strength and unremitting rage, and his description of the neighborhood as 'hostile,' illustrate implicit racial bias that taints use-of-force decisions. These biases surely contribute to the fact that African Americans are 21 times more likely to be shot by police than whites in the US, but the statement's racial implications remain unexamined.Because of the great social implications of cases involving police shootings of people of color, the presumption in these cases should be that prosecutors utilize the public preliminary hearing process instead of the secret grand jury proceeding.In a unified statement, several civil and human rights organizations recommended an independent and comprehensive federal investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ). They said the DOJ should also investigate all police killings and reports of the use of excessive force and racial profiling against youth and people of color. And they would require Body-Worn Cameras to record every police-civilian encounter, and increased community oversight of local law enforcement.Thousands of people in cities throughout the country are protesting the travesty of justice that occurred in Ferguson. But, as the civil and human rights organizations wrote in their statement, ""Nothing will be resolved until there is a systemic change throughout this nation in the implicit and explicit bias against people of color and particularly African-American youth who are routinely targeted by law enforcement even within their own communities.""Marjorie Cohn, a criminal defense attorney, is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, where she teaches criminal law, criminal procedure, and evidence.
