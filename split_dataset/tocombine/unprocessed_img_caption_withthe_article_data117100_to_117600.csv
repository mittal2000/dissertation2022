Iceland slaughtered its first endangered Fin whale and Japan massacred 30 Northern Minke whales. A grenade-tipped harpoon aboard a Northwest Pacific Japanese whale-killing ship. Since the 1986 world moratorium on whaling, Japan, Iceland and Norway have killed over 32,000 whales.

This is incongruous since only three percent of Icelanders even eat whale meat. So, instead, Iceland's only whaling company is left murdering whales to supply Japan's burgeoning dog food market. Fins are the second largest whales to swim the seas, They play a crucial ecological role in fertilizing the seas. Photo credit: animalplanet.com  Both Iceland and Japan are in contravention of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora prohibiting sending or receiving endangered animal parts.  Similar to the insatiable Southeast Asian and Chinese demand for rhino horns and elephant tusks, brains and genitalia, Japan's voracious lust for whale meat is driving bloodthirsty Icelanders to higher levels of carnage. Whaling is a brutal bloodlust that inflicts excruciating pain for almost one hour prior to the death of the harpooned creature. Photo credit alternews.com  Since 2008, over 5,500 tons of endangered Fin meat has been exported from Iceland, including a ghastly shipment exceeding 2,000 tons in March.   Last year, when 130 tons of endangered Fin meat landed in Germany, en route to Japan, it was promptly refused entry and quickly returned to Iceland. Sadly, that was not the case in February of this year. Twelve containers of Icelandic endangered Fin meat landed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was shipped 5,500 miles across Canadian railway, received in Vancouver, British Columbia then loaded onto a cargo freighter bound for Japan.  Icelandic whalers prepare to carve up a Fin whale to supply Japan's robust pet food market. This is an act of global ecocide, impoverishing all children of the Earth. Photo credit: alternews.com   Perplexingly, most Japanese do not eat whale meat. Yet, 6,000 metric tons of it is cold stored. Why is Japan stockpiling endangered whale meat?  Last week, hot off the announcement by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that Japan intends upon resuming commercial whaling in 2015 within the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, its Northwest Pacific 'Lethal Research' team slay 30 Northern Minkes.   Japanese 'lethal research' is bogus science. Fins can reach almost 90 feet and weigh an astonishing 74 tons. They have been called 'The Greyhounds of the Sea' by Roy Chapman Andrews for their beautiful, slender bodies which resemble racing yachts. Fins can easily surpass the speed of the fastest ocean steamship. Photo credit SeaShepherd.org  In March, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague rebuked Japan for attempting to use 'science' to justify a decade of poaching protected whales within an international sanctuary.  When it comes to killing ocean life, Japan's egregious sense of entitlement raises an even more poignant question: What happens when the ICJ rules to protect nature and superpowers like Japan disregard the highest court's judgments?  Fin possess extraordinary loud, long and pure calls. Horrendous man-made ocean noises, including oil and gas exploration and naval sonar, are badly harming Fins by impeding their ability to communicate and mate. In worse case scenarios, human sonar shatters their eardrums and they die a hideous death. Photo credit: wwf.panda.org  The Managing Director of Sea Shepherd Australia, Jeff Hansen summed up the prolonged global looting spree of our oceans this way: ""These whale poachers have no respect for the global moratorium and the wishes of the majority of people on this planet that want to see an end to whaling. Whales are worth far more to us alive than they ever did from whaling, especially now with the explosion of the global whale watching industry and the sheer importance whales play in the health of our oceans. Iceland, increasing its murdering quota of endangered Fin whales to be sold to Japan, where much of the whale meat will end up as dog food, is a complete lack of respect for these beautiful, intelligent and socially complex mammals, a complete lack of respect for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and a complete lack of respect for our children that want to grow up in world with the great whales.""  Moreover, each year 175,000 tourists visit Iceland specifically to whale watch, spending millions of dollars enjoying these splendid, surreal creatures.  In the summer of 2012, Danish scientists inspected a North Atlantic endangered Fin washed-up along Denmark's coastline. They were stunned to discover this 74-ton regal rorqual whale was 140 years old, 24 years older than the previous oldest known Fin whale. Fins along with Blues have the lowest frequency sounds of any animal on the planet. They can be heard clearly across entire ocean basins, spanning 5,000 miles. Photo credit: F. BendinoniOver the past 200 years humans have annihilated over five million whales.  Fins swim in the North Atlantic around Iceland. Only a loathsome human bully unremittingly slaughters animals just for the sake of it.   Poaching ancient endangered whales to feed Japanese dogs is bloody wrong!   It's time to end the gruesome 'War Against Nature,' now.Sea Shepherd relies upon volunteers to help protect our oceans. Make a difference and be part of a global movement for healthy oceans.

Israeli naval commandos seized the vessel on March 5, 2014 in the Red Sea between Eritrea and Sudan, as it was said to carry on Iranian shipment of M-302 rockets destined for the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.

AFP PHOTO /JACK GUEZ (Photo credit should read JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc139402400005500e46ec4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Louis CharbonneauUNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Reuters) - A U.N. expert panel has concluded that a shipment of rockets and other weapons that was seized by Israel came from Iran and represents a violation of the U.N. arms embargo on Tehran, according to a confidential report obtained by Reuters on Friday.The finding comes just days ahead of the next round of negotiations in Vienna between Iran and six world powers aimed at securing a deal that would gradually lift international sanctions on Tehran -- including the arms embargo -- in exchange for curbs on the controversial Iranian nuclear program.Despite Israel's public statements that the seized arms were destined for Gaza -- an allegation that Gaza's governing Islamist militant group Hamas dismissed as a fabrication -- the experts said the weapons were being sent to Sudan.The experts do not speculate in the report about why the arms were being sent to Sudan, a country which Western diplomatic and intelligence sources have told Reuters has in the past been a conduit for Iranian arms shipments to other locations in Africa, as well as the Gaza Strip.The experts said the Israeli U.N. mission wrote to the U.N. Iran Sanctions Committee on March 13 about ""the transfer of rockets, mortars and related materiel from Iran to Sudan.""The 14-page report on the incident by the U.N. Security Council's Panel of Experts on Iran makes no mention of the Gaza Strip as a possible destination for the arms, which were concealed in 20 containers on the Panamanian-flagged vessel Klos C. The weaponry was seized by Israeli authorities in March.The U.N. experts reached their conclusion after investigating the case and inspecting the seized cargo and documentation related to the shipment, which traveled from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas to the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr, and from there in the direction of Port Sudan.The vessel was intercepted by the Israeli navy in the Red Sea before it reached Sudan.""The Panel finds that the manner of concealment in this case is consistent with several other cases reported to the (Security Council's Iran Sanctions) Committee and investigated by the Panel,"" the experts said.""The Panel concludes that the shipment of arms and related materiel found aboard the Klos C is a violation of Iran's obligations under paragraph 5 of resolution 1747,"" they added, referring to the U.N. arms embargo on Tehran.Despite Iranian denials, the experts said official seals from Iranian customs authorities on containers that held some of the arms ""substantiates the Iranian origin of those containers."" Further evidence on the Iranian origin came from the Iranian bill of lading, cargo manifest and the container stowage plan.Iran's U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NO PROOF OF SYRIAN ORIGINThe report includes details on the arms, which were concealed in a shipment of cement: 40 M302 rockets and fuses, including four different variations of the rockets; 181 120 mm mortar shells; roughly 400,000 pieces of 7.62 caliber ammunition.The experts could not confirm the Israeli allegation that some of the weapons were made in Syria.""According to Israeli officials, the rockets were produced in Syria by the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC),"" they said. ""No markings were identified on the rockets during the Panel's inspection that would have allowed confirmation of the Syrian origin of the rockets.""""One expert notes that the Syrian origin of the rockets cannot be independently established and neither can the movement of the rockets from Syria to Iran,"" the report added.It was not clear from the report what, if any, role Iraq could have played in the smuggling of weaponry. The 20 containers that held the illicit arms were part of the 100-container shipment loaded onto the Klos C at Bandar Abbas, Iran.The 50 containers of cement loaded onto the ship at Umm Qasr in Iraq did not contain weapons, the report said, citing information the experts had received from Israeli authorities.The experts said the concealment techniques were similar to other cases of alleged sanctions violations by Iran they have investigated -- in Nigeria, arms were shipped amid crates of marble; in other cases reported by Israel arms were hidden in containers with polyethylene pellets, lentils and cotton.In another case of reported by Italy, Iran allegedly shipped dried explosives among bags of powdered milk, the report said.At the time that the arms were seized, Israel said the case showed Iran was not negotiating in good faith with the six powers - the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.""At the same time that it is talking to world powers, at the same time that Iran is smiling and saying all kinds of honeyed words, that same Iran is sending lethal weaponry to terrorist organizations and it is doing so in a complex web of covert, worldwide operations,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.The circulation of the Panel of Experts' report to the Iran Sanctions Committee just ahead of a deadline for Iran and the six powers to reach an agreement in the Vienna nuclear talks clearly irritated Russia.Earlier this week Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, complained that ""any information not backed up by concrete facts ... could have a negative impact on the conduct of negotiations of the group of six and Iran.""But Russia was in the minority in its complaints. Other Security Council members, including the chair of the Iran sanctions committee, Australian Ambassador Gary Quinlan, praised the investigative work of the Panel of Experts.France's deputy U.N. envoy Alexis Lamek said the experts annual report submitted to the sanctions committee last month was a ""precise source of information on Iran's illicit programs and its methods of circumventing sanctions.""The panel's annual report said that Tehran's illicit procurement appeared to have slowed during its negotiations with the six powers, though Iranians continued to attempt to bypass sanctions on a regular basis.

What does this say about the evolutionary purpose of music?Previous work by McDermott and Hauser showed that when tamarins and marmosets were given a choice between a lullaby played on a flute, an excerpt of German techno, or silence, they preferred silence. This new research was investigating whether non-Western music might provoke a different response in nonhuman primates. Would the different rhythmic structures and musical scales in non-Western music change preferences?The study played African, Indian, and Japanese music near large chimp enclosures and looked at whether the animals spent time in places where the music was loud and clear or in places further from the loudspeakers, where it was quiet or inaudible. For African and Indian music the chimps spent significantly more time in places where the music could be heard. For Japanese music they more often went to places where the music was difficult or impossible to hear.The researchers think the preference may be due to the rhythmic content of the music. The African and Indian pieces didn't have an obvious pulse to them that you could tap your foot along to, whereas the Japanese music had a strong regular pulse.Study co-author Frans de Waal, Ph.D., of Emory University, commented, ""Chimpanzees may perceive the strong, predictable rhythmic patterns as threatening, as chimpanzee dominance displays commonly incorporate repeated rhythmic sounds such as stomping, clapping and banging objects.""One reason for this sort of study is to try to understand the evolutionary basis for music. Experimental psychologist Steven Pinker famously described music as ""auditory cheesecake,"" something that is pleasurable but has no adaptive function, arising as a byproduct of other evolutionary pressures, like the pressure that led to the development of language. But if music is purely a byproduct of the pressures that led to language, then why would chimpanzees show a preference for some types of music?The number of scientific papers looking into the role of rhythm in music is surprisingly small. This bias is something that needs addressing if we are to fully understand why we make and love music."
3,POLITICS,"Thank You for Your Service, But It's Time to Go Justice Ginsburg","Jeanne Zaino, ContributorPolitical analyst, columnist, author, pollster and professor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/should-justices-ginsburg-_b_5536274.html,"If either Ginsburg or Breyer resign this summer we can expect a contentious, drawn out, and divisive confirmation battle. But that is nothing like we are bound to see if they wait until after November when odds are the Republicans will take the Senate.",2014-06-27,2014-06-27-Idea12PixGinsburg_Ruth_Bader_Justice.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-27-Idea12PixGinsburg_Ruth_Bader_Justice-thumb.jpg,"It's the time of year when the Supreme Court not only hands down high profile rulings, but the justices announce their intention to retire. For a while many thought Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, now 81, and the oldest serving member on the Court, might step aside.  But despite her age, health challenges, and the fact that she has served on the Supreme Court for more than 20 years, Ginsburg put that rumor to rest last year when she said she's ""likely to stay on the court for at least another two years."" Ginsburg's announcement might not have mattered as much to Democrats at that time. After all, in March of 2013, it didn't look nearly as possible as it does now for Republicans to capture the Senate. But more than a year later, the odds of the GOP taking the Senate have increased dramatically.In order to gain control of the Senate, Republicans need six additional seats. They currently hold 45 seats to the Democrats 53, plus the two independents that caucus with them. If Republicans pick up five seats, Vice President Biden would be able to cast the tie-breaking vote on behalf of the Democrats. There are a total of 36 seats up for this election cycle, 21 currently held by Democrats and 15 by Republicans. As The Hill reported earlier this week, the GOP is ""in the strongest positions to win back the Senate since losing it eight years ago."" As Table 2 shows, this assessment is echoed by most prognosticators and forecast models.Given these odds, which increasingly favor the Republicans, Ginsburg should not wait another year, she should retire now. In the interest of all the issues she cares so deeply about, she should step down and allow President Obama to nominate a justice who shares her judicial philosophy. If she waits until the end of next term, the chances of the Senate confirming a nominee of this kind decrease dramatically.And while Ginsburg is the oldest member of the Court, she is not the longest serving justice or the only one over 75. In addition to Ginsburg, there are three other justices that are 75 or older: Antonin Scalia (78), Anthony Kennedy (77), and Stephen Breyer (75). Appointed in 1986 by President Reagan, Scalia is also the longest serving member, followed by Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.It makes little sense for Scalia, Kennedy or Thomas to retire now given that both the White House and Senate are controlled by the Democrats. Moreover, despite serving two years longer than Ginsburg, Thomas is just 66-years-old. But is not the case for the more liberal Stephen Breyer. At 75, Breyer is six years younger than Ginsburg and he hasn't faced as many health issues. If, however, the GOP wins in November, he will be at least 78 before it is even possible for the Democrats to reclaim the upper-chamber. Moreover, if the Republicans win the White House in 2016, he would be 82 before it would be possible for the Democrats to take it back. Given this reality, it makes at least as much sense for Breyer to seriously consider retirement at this point as it does Ginsburg.In a recent interview, former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens told This Week's George Stephanopoulos that he thinks it is proper for a justice to take the reality of the ""politics"" of the day into account when deciding whether it is the right time to retire. ""It's an appropriate thing to think about your successor, not only in this job.""Over the last 34 years, 10 justices have retired from the Court. In terms of the timing, half of these justices retired during midterm election years, three others retired during a presidents first term and two during a presidents second term. More importantly, in making these decisions several seem to have followed Stevens' lead and considered the political reality of the moment. For instance, former Justices Harry Blackmun and David Souter chose to retire during Clinton's and Obama's first terms. In doing so, they paved the way for the appointment of justices who share their more moderate-liberal philosophy (Breyer and Sotomayor respectively). It is never an easy question to ask -- but it is one everyone who is lucky enough to get to this point has to think about: do aging leaders have an obligation to help develop a younger generation who can follow in their footsteps? Just the other day New York Congressman Charles Rangel (D) won a heated primary in his district guaranteeing that at the age of 84 he will be returning to Congress for a 23rd term. The same day at the age of 76, Senator Thad Cochran won the Republican primary in Mississippi.One of the questions that came up during these races was whether the Rangel and Cochran had done enough during their long careers to develop a new generation of leaders? Speaking on WNYC's The Brian Lehrer Show, a voter from Rangel's district put it this way: My argument for time for Rangel to go now is really about the need to develop a new generation of leadership. And despite his 43 years in Congress he has never done that... and at one point he said if there was anyone else he thought was qualified to do this job he would support that person. Well shame on him if in 40 years in office at the center of the black political universe here he has not developed that next generation of leadership. You have to do that in the private sector you have to do that in the non-profit sector.... Succession planning is very much a part of your obligation as a leader.And while the justices often like to consider themselves above politics, that isn't the case. They may first and foremost be trained jurists and committed to the law, but everything from their appointment to the Court to their work on the bench is informed by politics. That is as it should be. After all, the Supreme Court sits at the apex of the third branch of government. There is no question Justices Ginsburg and Breyer have energy, all their faculties, and every right to remain on the bench, but that doesn't mean they should. As the voter from Rangel's district said, succession planning is the obligation of all leaders. And when you are a Supreme Court justice, the political realities of the time in which you are nearing retirement age not only matter, but should be taken into account. If either Ginsburg or Breyer resign this summer we can expect a contentious, drawn out, and divisive confirmation battle. But that is nothing like we are bound to see if they wait until after November when odds are the Republicans will take the Senate."
4,WORLDPOST,Protesters Blame Karzai For Creating Afghanistan Election Crisis,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/afghanistan-election-protests_n_5536202.html,,2014-06-27,"Supporters of Afghanistan's presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah chant slogans during a protest against election fraud in Kabul, Afghanistan, Friday, June 27, 2014. Writing on the poster reads, ""defend our nation's votes it's our responsibility."" Afghanistan's security situation has been complicated by a political crisis stemming from allegations of massive fraud in the recent election to replace President Hamid Karzai, the only leader the country has known since the Taliban regime was ousted nearly 13 years ago. Abdullah Abdullah, one of two candidates who competed a runoff vote on June 14 suspended his relations with the Independent Election Commission after he accused electoral officials of engineering extensive vote rigging, allegations they have denied. (AP Photo/Massoud Hossaini)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1393a2600003400709477.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Hamid Shalizi and Jessica DonatiKABUL, June 27 (Reuters) - As thousands of Afghans poured into the streets of Kabul on Friday to protest over the impasse in their country's presidential election, there was little doubt who they held responsible for the mess - outgoing President Hamid Karzai.""Death to Karzai!"" some shouted through loudspeakers as protesters marched on the presidential palace, accusing him of creating the crisis over his successor.No one has provided any hard evidence that the protesters are right, but even within Karzai's family and inner circle, many believe the president quietly engineered the electoral debacle to keep his hands on the levers of power.Among them is his brother, Mahmoud Karzai, who says the man who has ruled the war-weary country for more than 12 years deliberately pushed powerful players apart to ensure no one candidate would emerge with a clear majority.That may mean he stays on by default until a solution is found. Meanwhile, his vice-presidents are now trying to resolve the row between the two candidates in the fraud-marred second round of voting, potentially giving the president an indirect hand in the outcome.Abdullah Abdullah, one of the two, dropped out of the electoral process in a pique of fury last week, accusing Hamid Karzai of rigging the election to retain control over the next government.""He tried, from the very beginning, not to allow a clear winner in order to explore the possibilities of staying in power,"" Mahmoud Karzai told Reuters.Asked for comments on allegations made by Mahmoud Karzai and others, a spokeswoman for the president repeated a general statement issued by his office: ""President Hamid Karzai has been neutral in this process and he repeatedly directed all government workers not to use government apparatus in favor or against a candidate.""Hamid Karzai denies that he has any ambitions to remain in office and told U.S. Special Envoy James Dobbins this week that a new president would be inaugurated Aug. 2 as scheduled.Jan Kubis, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan, however warned the Security Council in an address this week of the risk of ""a protracted confrontation with a danger of a slide into violence"".If Afghanistan's first-ever transfer of power is delayed, another key effect could be to doom the already long-delayed Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) between Kabul and Washington, which would leave a small contingent of U.S. troops in Afghanistan beyond 2014.The BSA has been blocked since last year by Karzai, who would be unlikely to sign it if he stayed on or allow it to be signed if he retains influence.That would leave local forces to keep the peace on their own in a county that is riven by ethnic rivalries and dogged by a Taliban insurgency, and it could lead to a meltdown in foreign aid so crucial to the battered economy and security forces.Although Afghanistan currently has little of the sectarian tensions now tearing Iraq apart, many are anxiously drawing parallels with a country that U.S. troops left in 2011 without a deal to maintain a military presence.The two contenders for the presidency, Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, both say would sign the BSA promptly if elected.POLITICAL QUAGMIREBrother Mahmoud, who is angry about the president's refusal to back a bid by another brother, Qayum, for the presidency, said Hamid Karzai deliberately pushed powerful candidates apart ahead of the first round of voting to ensure a splintered outcome.""Karzai encouraged many individuals to run in order to engineer a political quagmire,"" Mahmoud said.He argued that this strategy was designed to force a polarizing run-off pitting a Tajik candidate against a Pasthun - Abdullah against Ghani - fueling ethnic rivalries and triggering a crisis that would require his intervention.Pashtuns dominate the dozens of ethnic groups and tribes that live in Afghanistan, but Tajiks form a substantial minority.The three brothers were close at the start of the election process, dining together regularly, but Mahmoud says he has had little to do with the president after Qayum dropped out.Qayum could not be reached for comment.Others close to the president in the corridors of power agree that in a fraud-ridden electoral system, a close outcome was always going to end in disaster and allow Karzai to step in.No one who complained in conversations with Reuters however had any concrete evidence of manipulation.""I told Karzai that things are getting worse and it might get out of control if the people lose faith and trust in the election. Karzai replied, don't worry, everything is manageable,"" said one confidant, a senior government official, describing a conversation he had with the president last week.""Now both of his vice-presidents ... are in talks with both candidates to make things smooth and agree on some deal makings, while Karzai himself plays innocent,"" the official added.Some diplomats also believe Karzai may use the negotiations to take on some advisory role in a new government.The Independent Election Commission (IEC) conceded that there had been official meddling in the process, but rejected suggestions that Karzai had been part of it.""There has been interference in the election by government officials and we have raised this,"" said IEC spokeman Noor Mohammad Noor. ""President Hamid Karzai has always tried to make sure there was a transparent election. It is baseless to claim that President Karzai is behind all this."" ""A CHOREOGRAPHED PERFORMANCE""Kate Clark of the Afghanistan Analysts Network said the first round was genuinely competitive and eliminated the candidate considered by most to be Karzai's favorite.""The fact that the election was competitive did really knock on the head the conspiracy thoery that he was running the election,"" Clark said.Braving threats by the Taliban militants, millions turned out on June 14 to choose between Abdullah and Ghani.Despite those successes for democracy, some diplomats believe Karzai will in the end broker a compromise solution between the protagonists, who would have more to lose from a protracted standoff.Billions of dollars have poured into the country since the Taliban were ousted in 2001, allowing businesses to prosper and a new class of elites to emerge. None stand to gain from a repeat of the bloody civil war that devasted the country in the 1990s and paved the way for the Taliban to seize power in 1996.""This is all a carefully choreographed performance,"" said one foreign official.Karzai's confidant added: ""The president does not want to see an outright winner in the election but one who is dependent on Karzai to seek him for direction in all affairs.""

But before they arrived at their destination, every single prisoner had been killed.The official account given hours after the killing on Monday by the governor of Hilla, 92km (57 miles) south of Baghdad, was that militants had attacked the convoy killing 10 prisoners and one policeman in the crossfire.""The convoy protection force fiercely responded to the terrorist attack,"" Governor Sadiq Madloul told reporters.But a police captain, a second police officer and a senior local official from where the prisoners died in Hilla, all speaking on condition of anonymity while giving an account that differed from the official line, told Reuters no attack took place, and the police had executed the 69 men.A third police source who would not contradict the account that the convoy had come under attack nevertheless confirmed that all 69 had been killed and said some had not died in the crossfire but were gunned down to prevent them from escaping.The deaths in Hilla came less than a week after the killing of 52 prisoners in Baquba, a regional capital north of Baghdad.The police account there also was that the prisoners had died in the crossfire during a battle with insurgents. But local Sunni officials including the mayor and the provincial governor, medical staff at the morgue and relatives of the dead all said the victims were gunned down in their jail cells.Iraq's government has long denied it summarily executes prisoners. Following a Reuters report on police executions in March, army spokesman Sa'ad Ma'an said: ""If it happened, whoever committed it will be investigated, held accountable and sent to a military court.""Ma'an and other Iraqi government spokesmen did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the latest killings outside Hilla.Unlike the Iraqi government, Sunni insurgents from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant make no attempt to hide mass executions of prisoners: they proudly proclaim that Shi'ites are heretics who must die, and boast of the killings.Days after they began sweeping through northern cities on June 10, they released videos showing their masked fighters machine gunning captive government soldiers lying in shallow graves. On Friday, Human Rights Watch said ISIL had executed at least 160 people in Tikrit this month.But the reports that government forces loyal to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki are also executing prisoners are becoming more regular as the conflict intensifies, calling into question Washington's stepped-up military support for the Shi'ite premier. PRE-EMPTIONSeveral police sources interviewed by Reuters said prisoners were being preemptively killed in Iraq to prevent militant groups from freeing them to rejoin the rebellion.""We feed them and keep them healthy and if the ISIL managed to free them, they will immediately resume fighting us,"" the police captain who acknowledged the executions in Hilla said.""We have to defend ourselves by executing those criminals.""The second Hilla police officer said summary executions were routinely carried out by army and police forces.""First thing we do is to shoot them in foot and then take their confessions. Then we kill them and write in report they were killed in action,"" he said, also on condition of anonymity.The third police officer, who denied that the Hilla prisoners were executed, nevertheless said the reason some of the 69 had been shot was to prevent them from escaping. He said the convoy had been hit by a roadside bomb and came under fire.""We are not an execution squad. What happened was that we were trying to transport high-profile, dangerous members of al Qaeda - most of them awaiting death sentences - to another secure detention center south of Baghdad,"" he said.""The convoy came under attack by militants who set off two roadside bombs. Some of the prisoners wanted to use the attack to escape. We shot them dead as they were escaping.""A senior local official in Hilla said the attack on the convoy had been staged to hide the execution.""The police brought the bodies of 16 other terrorists they had executed earlier to the scene and laid weapons by their corpses to pretend they had attacked the convoy,"" he said.ISIL ATTACKSOne of ISIL's main aims is to free Sunni prisoners from government jails, and Iraqi police and troops who guard them come under frequent attack.A year ago ISIL launched its biggest military operation in years, attacking two jails. Hundreds of convicts, including senior members of al Qaeda, were freed from Abu Ghraib jail on Baghdad's western outskirts in the assault, which saw suicide bombers blast through the gates.When militants took Mosul city on June 10 at the start of their present offensive, they freed as many as 1,000 prisoners from a jail.The government's harsh justice towards prisoners did not begin with this month's ISIL advance, however.In a Reuters investigation in March, a police officer, an army officer, a general and an Iraqi Special Forces member all said that in western Anbar province Iraqi troops had begun replying in kind to ISIL, carrying out extra-judicial executions, torture and humiliations of their enemy and posting images of the results online.On June 4, a week before the assault on Mosul, the chief of police in Hilla held a news conference to display six captives, charged with a car bomb attack that killed 14 people. The prisoners confessed in front of cameras to having bombed Hilla hospital.Hours later, Police Chief Major General Riad al-Hikani posted pictures of the bullet-riddled bodies of four of the suspects on his Facebook page.He said they had been killed when unidentified assailants opened fire while they were being escorted to cells, but expressed no regret at the death of captives in his custody.""Delighted that divine justice has been achieved against them,"" Hikani wrote on Facebook.

She toured the capitol, but that's not her most vivid memory of the trip.Horan, 64, was attacked by four large stray dogs shortly after she left the building, and was badly bitten.It was the latest in a series of headaches for statehouse officials that have included tumbling plaster inside the building and a battle over a monument to Satan outside the 97-year-old neoclassical structure.Horan, a dealer in antique postcards from Colorado, suffered a deep bite on her buttock and has rung up about $22,000 in rabies shots and other medical bills.""It was the most horrible experience in my life,"" she said.

(Photo by Claudio Villa/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb764a53c000066000d89ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the wake of the Suarez biting incident, by far the most exciting -- or at least bizarre -- event of the World Cup thus far, global media has gone in to frenzy. Everyone has had their say on Luis, his mental state and his place in international football -- he's been called every name you can think of including crazy and ""an animal."" Nowhere, however, has the reaction been more extreme than in the striker's own country. His nine-game ban effectively signals the end of Uruguay's World Cup ambitions and over the course of the last three days the country's denial of reality and general outrage has been almost as spectacular as the bite in itself. For those who haven't followed, in the press conference after the match, the players refused to answer the questions of the British press, which many accuse of demonizing Suarez. Lugano, the Uruguayan captain, when asked what he thought of the incident simply said, ""What incident?"" Tabarez, the Uruguayan coach, when pressed for comment said he hadn't seen what happened and told journalists, ""This is a football World Cup, not about cheap morality."" Later, Lugano called Giorgio Chiellini, victim of the bite, a wimp and said ""as a man he disappointed me totally."" But the comments haven't been limited to the world of football. Living in Uruguay and watching the drama unfold has been quite incredible. Everyone from the shopkeepers to political figures have something to say. Yesterday evening our president, Jose Mujica, commented on the case saying, ""I didn't see him bite anyone"" and ""we didn't pick him to be a philosopher, or a mechanic or to have good morals, he's an excellent player."" The PIT-CNT, Uruguay's largest union, declared in an email that ""the sanction was absolutely disproportional and excessive"" and that ""a fundamental part of [Luis Suarez's] DNA is a way of feeling and understanding football which is incomprehensible to anyone who born outside this country."" As I write this there is a protest outside the UK embassy because fans are convinced that England is somehow behind the Suarez ban. The reactions this has solicited may seem absurd to anyone outside Uruguay, and several people have asked me: ""How on earth can you defend him?"" But demonizing Suarez doesn't do justice to the situation either. To understand why that is you have to understand what football means for a country like Uruguay and to understand that you have to get what it means to be from a place that, as a general rule, no one cares about. Granted, it may be hard for Americans and Europeans to understand, but football is literally the only moment where we take center stage. During the World Cup not only do we participate in the goings on of the rest of the world, but we win. The ""bite"" in Tuesday's match overshadowed the fact that teeny little Uruguay kicked two world champions out of the World Cup in the space of a week. Football is Uruguay's way of saying, Hey world, we're here and we matter. Uruguay worships at the altar of football, and Suarez is God. In that context, then, it's not hard to understand Uruguay's disappointment and sense of injustice. In this World Cup alone examples of gratuitous violence are plentiful but none have garnered the attention of the ""bite."" Take Pepe from Portugal, for example, who after hitting Thomas Müller in the face got up off the floor, with the ball nowhere in sight, and head-butted the man he'd just hit. Surely that's worse than a bite? It got him a red card and Portugal was later eliminated from the Cup, but it got nowhere near the media attention of the Suarez incident. Or take Kevin-Prince Boateng and Sulley Muntari from Ghana who attacked executive members of the GFA and a management member of the Black Stars both verbally and physically. That definitely can't be passed off as part of the game -- they weren't even attacking other players! Their own team kicked them out and sent them home but FIFA didn't intervene. It's not surprising that Uruguay might think the world has something against Suarez. We can all agree that more than anything Suarez's action was foolish, especially when you consider what the World Cup means to his teammates and his country. But let's give him this; at least he makes for a good show, which is after all what the World Cup is about. Even if you accept that the ""bite"" was worse than other common football aggressions it seems a bit hypocritical, to say the least, that the FIFA have become the guardians of modern morality. In between scandals for fixing matches in 2010, millions of dollars lost in corruption, and accusations of using of slave labor to build stadiums for Qatar 2022 a bite seems almost comically innocent. But in the end when you enter a tournament you agree to play by its rules and accept its authority. Even though from Uruguay's perspective it's hard to understand what the deal is with the bite, we'll have to play on without Luis. Luis, we love you anyway. Thank you for making our little country dream big. "

The deadly blaze captured the nation's attention for weeks and marked the greatest loss of life from a U.S. wildfire since 1933.The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for the lives lost in the so-called Yarnell Hill Fire and demands answers to what happened to cause all but one of the Granite Mountain hotshots firefighters to be overrun by flames on June 30.""They want to know what happened to their loved ones and they want to ensure that this tragedy never happens again,"" Phoenix attorney Patrick McGroder III, who is representing the families in the lawsuit, told Reuters.Family members also seek a meeting with state fire officials to see what went wrong and with hopes of developing policies, procedures and other tools to change the way fires are currently fought, according to the suit filed late on Wednesday in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix.Named as defendants are the state and its forestry division, Yavapai County and the Central Yavapai County Fire District.

At a workshop in Washington, D.C., lawyers and volunteers will give legal residents information about how to apply for citizenship, encourage them to do so, answer questions and help them fill out paperwork. The workshop is for legal permanent residents who are eligible for citizenship, and for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and hope for relief under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. Immigrant rights group CASA de Maryland, the Laborers' International Union of North America and other organizations are also participating.In general, green card holders can begin the application process for citizenship after five years of permanent residency in the U.S. But not all who are eligible apply, meaning they cannot vote, and could be deported in certain circumstances. As of 2012, there were an estimated 13.3 million legal permanent residents in the U.S., and 8.8 million were eligible to apply for citizenship, according to a report from the Department of Homeland Security.AFL-CIO executive vice president Tefere Gebre, a naturalized citizen himself, said the group hopes to educate immigrants about the benefits of being citizens. He moved to the U.S. from Ethiopia 30 years ago.""Sometimes it's a tough thing for immigrants to decide to disavow the country that you were born in,"" he said. ""It's a difficult decision to do, but all of us came here because we chose this country. On election day, when I go to a polling place, that's the most I feel an American.""The AFL-CIO has been part of a coalition of groups pushing for comprehensive immigration reform, which has languished in the House of Representatives after passing the Senate one year ago. Getting more immigrants -- who may be more sympathetic to the plight of undocumented immigrants, among other issues -- to become citizens and vote could help in that goal, Gebre said. ""We're going to get immigration reform down the road ... but if this Congress is not going to do it, we have to get a Congress that will do it,"" he said. ""And that will be decided at the ballot box."" "

And Rob Ford's numbers are higher than....the approval rating of the U.S. Congress. This is HuffPollster for Friday, June 27, 2014.OBAMA APPROVAL DROPS - Earlier this week, Gallup reported that the weekly average of President Obama’s approval rating had dipped to 41 percent after months of stability in the mid-40s. Other national polls released over the past two weeks show a similar, consistent trend, with Obama's disapproval rising by between 1.4 and 3 points in surveys by six separate polls. All, except for Rasmussen, now put his approval below 43 percent. Gallup's Jeffrey M. Jones sees an explanation in the timing: ""The long stretch of stability from mid-March to early June occurred during a period that was hardly uneventful for the president, including controversies over medical care for U.S. military veterans at Veterans Affairs hospitals and a prisoner exchange of five Taliban detainees for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. But Iraq may be the issue weighing most heavily on Obama's public support given the timing of the drop in approval.""

Simply put, Democratic base voters (unmarried women, younger people, and minorities), don’t show up to vote in mid-terms. Meanwhile, the GOP base – namely older, white voters – do….More ominous for Democrats, however, is how much more negatively their base feels about the state of the economy than they did at the end of the 2012 campaign. Across the board, voters that make up the Democratic coalition -- women, minorities, young people, and economically downscale voters -- are more pessimistic about the economy than they were in 2012….Despite how ominous these numbers look for Democrats, it’s important to remember that: 1) they measure national mood and not the mood in the key battleground states where control of Congress will be determined; 2) Republicans were convinced that the “enthusiasm gap” would help them win in 2012, only to be shocked to discover that the Obama campaign was able to get their voters out on Election Day.""

In a Washington Post magazine interview published on Friday, Kumar spoke about her work with the nonpartisan organization, the growth of the Latino population and possible Latino candidates for the White House. Actress Rosario Dawson and Kumar founded Voto Latino, an organization dedicated to increasing civic engagement among young Latinos, in 2004. For it’s 10-year anniversary, the organization is hosting four Power Summits across the country in New York City, Miami, San Antonio and San Jose. During their chat, the Washington Post’s Josh Heim first asked Kumar if there were currently any “good presidential candidates.” “Well, if she wasn’t a justice I would say Sonia Sotomayor — she is such a rock star because she represents so much of the Latino community and the aspirations of immigrants and Americans. And she tells the truth in a way that is refreshing,” Kumar said.When Heim pressed for any other names, the executive director of Voto Latino says she doesn’t think there are any fully formed candidates in the Latino community just yet. “If you look at who people have been mentioned as presidential candidates, from Marco Rubio to a VP candidate, Julian Castro to Ted Cruz, all of them are under 45,"" Kumar added. ""So, our presidential candidate for America is still in the making, and that’s what makes it exciting.""Several celebrities have joined the Voto Latino cause over the years, including singer Demi Lovato and actor Wilmer Valderrama. During the New York City Power Summit in April, the “That 70’s Show” star explained why it’s so important for Latinos to be engaged as citizens. “A lot of what's happening is that a lot of communities have an opinion, but they don't walk it -- they don't speak it,” Valderrama told Latina magazine. “They only yell it, you know? They only vent. I think that this is the opportunity... So, the idea is if you're a minority -- it doesn't matter if you're Indian, Asian, Latino, African American -- you have a duty to speak your mind and actually shape the government that you need for tomorrow. If you don't speak your mind, you can't complain about the change that hasn't happened. But, if you can be part of the change, then you can enjoy the government that you've been waiting for.”The next Voto Latino Power Summit will be hosted in San Antonio in September. "

Precious, her 1-year-old daughter, lay gasping in her lap. Lips pursed, chest heaving - Precious' lungs were ravaged by bacteria and she was on the verge of suffocation. Looking out from Bilibo, her remote Liberian village, at the dirt path and log bridges extending deep into the dense rainforest, Rebecca knew there was only one way to get Precious medical care: to carry her by foot to the nearest clinic -- 14 hours away. Though illness is universal, access to care is not. Around the world, over 1 billion people in the world's most remote villages go their entire lives without being seen by a health worker. Following its civil war, Liberia had only 51 doctors to serve its 4 million people (for perspective, imagine just 10 doctors treating all of San Francisco). The WHO estimates the world is short 7.2 million health workers and that this gap is worsening. Even in countries with greater health workers exist they are too often based in out-of-reach clinics in cities -- days away from at risk children like Precious.All people deserve access to health care, no matter where they live. In the 21st century this shouldn't be a radical idea. The United Nations' Post-2015 Development Agenda is working to make universal health coverage a key goal. But, how will this goal be achieved? The standard solutions -- constructing more clinics and training more doctors -- are necessary, but not sufficient: doctors and clinics have failed to reach too many living in the world's most remote communities. Achieving universal health coverage requires universal health delivery -- for every person in every village. We can get there by seeking new opportunity in an old idea: community health workers. Using community members to deliver health interventions isn't a new idea, but professionalizing them -- transforming them from amateurs into high-performing providers -- is a strategy that's yet to spread. Though widely promoted as a means to bring primary health care to rural villages as early as 1978, community health workers (CHWs), at least in their conventional form, often fail. It's not their fault. Too many health systems still under-invest in community health; as a consequence CHWs underperform -- most particularly in remote villages where they're needed most.Why? When deploying CHWs, the status quo has been for a village chief to recruit community members -- without testing their qualifications -- to receive a few days of non-assessed training. Unequipped, unsupervised and unpaid, they are essentially treated like amateurs and never reach their full potential. The health of their people suffers as a result: those who never had access to healthcare ultimately never get it.To close the healthcare access gap we must do things differently. At Last Mile Health we are working to create a new workforce to save lives in the world's most remote villages by professionalizing community health workers. We study the five processes needed to deploy a community health worker -- recruiting, training, equipping, supervising and incentivizing -- and work to make each more efficient and more effective. In short, we make community health workers better.In remote Bilibo, we recruited one of Precious' neighbors, Zarkpa, a 25-year-old woman who had never had a job. Before Zarkpa earned the role of community health worker, she had to pass four tests: a community-vetting process; a literacy screen; oral and practical assessments; and a probationary period. Zarkpa was trained not for a few days, but for several months: she was instructed in the diagnosis and treatment of the top 10 killers of women and children and -- after passing stringent tests -- equipped with a backpack of point-of-care tests and life-saving medicines so she could start treating Precious. Zarkpa receives ongoing coaching from an outreach nurse who ensured Precious recovered safely and links her to the referral clinic in case of the unexpected. For all of this, we didn't expect Zarkpa to serve as a volunteer; we issued her a contract-guaranteed salary -- tying it to her performance so she would be accountable to her village.Investing in community health worker performance saves more lives. In September 2012, the Liberian Ministry of Health invited Last Mile Health to partner in Konobo, one of the most remote and worst performing health districts in the country. Our research showed people had to walk up to 14 hours to reach the nearest clinic and the average age of death was just 28.6 years. In just 18 months, we deployed 46 professionalized community health workers -- like Zarkpa -- to ensure all people in 41 hard-to-reach villages (spread across an area the size of Rhode Island) had access to a healthcare worker for the first time. CHW absenteeism and medication stock-outs are now at all-time lows and diagnostic accuracy is excellent. Today the women and children in Konobo have unprecedented access to care: 97 percent of women now receive prenatal care and 98 percent of children are treated right at their doorstep -- where care can have the biggest impact even when there are no roads. Achieving universal access to care by 2030 is a bold goal, but it is achievable if health systems invest in community health worker performance. Fortunately a number of leading groups and partners, such as the MDG Health Alliance, USAID, and the One Million Community Health Workers Campaign, are focusing on this challenge. No one should die because they live too far from a clinic. By giving community health workers the tools to succeed while holding them to rigorous performance standards, no one has to.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and The Aspen Institute, in conjunction with Spotlight: Health, a forum exploring the key issues of our time as they relate to medicine, population health and global health, as well as the relationship between health and other disciplines (part of the Aspen Ideas Festival, June 24-27, 2014).

But first, he will have to convince voters that he has changed.Haskins' criminal history includes jail-time in two states, including Michigan. His earliest offenses -- related to vehicle break-ins, he told the outlet -- date back to when he was 15 years old. (""I was just a lonely, angry kid at the time,"" he told MLive. ""If anything, I could be put on 'World's Dumbest Criminals.'"") Between April 2010 and January 2011, the Republican hopeful was arrested four times on charges related to trespassing and vehicle break-ins. Haskins' break-ins were often tied to an arguably bizarre sexual fetish called ""cranking."" When he broke into vehicles, Haskins would disconnect the ignition wires and re-start the engine while masturbating, police reports show. In an unrelated report by The Independent, Susan Block, Ph.D., a featured sexologist on HBO's ""Real Sex"" and ""Cathouse"" explained the fetish by saying, ""[t]he 'vroom' of the engine reminds [men] of their own libidos being revved up by this hot woman.""Haskins says he hopes voters can see he's evolved.

The 95th District House seat is currently held by State Representative Stacy Erwin Oakes (D). Perhaps unsurprisingly, Haskins isn't the only politician who has made news for bizarre behavior.

Ten years and 26 surgeries later, my hands and legs were physically repaired, but the loss of muscle in my right leg made it hard for me to keep my balance, turning simple tasks such as bending to pick up something off the floor into a struggle. The things I used to do every day -- go the grocery store, take my kids to the park, or even enjoy a ball game -- became triggers for my stress and anxiety. Because of my PTSD, I couldn't leave the house without the constant fear that someone was going to kill me. I figured my life was over as I knew it.I was wrong.I attended a Wounded Warrior Project event in Chicago and saw dozens of veterans with service dogs. I had never thought about or even considered getting a dog before. When I returned home to Indiana, I researched service dog organizations and came across the Indiana Canine Assistance Network (ICAN), an organization that trains service dogs for placement with people with disabilities throughout Indiana. The training process for a service dog lasts two years, and each year ICAN graduates two classes of puppies, once in the summer and once in the winter. I put in an application to ICAN in October 2012. A few weeks later, my application was approved. In February 2013, I called ICAN to see if there were any dogs that could potentially work for me. I was told that unfortunately, they did not have a dog for me at that time, and it would likely be December 2013 or January 2014 before I would have one. I was devastated.On Friday, April 12, 2013, my life changed. I received an email from ICAN inviting me to attend a call-in, an event where you meet a dog to see if it's a good match. Attending a call-in doesn't necessarily mean that the dog you meet is the one you will take home after graduation. That's the day I knew I was going to be okay. When Festus walked into the room, I saw a life I never imagined possible walking toward me. For a moment, I remembered who I had been 9 years before I had left for Iraq. It was hard for me to wrap my head around it at the time, but I soon realized this red ball of fur was going to give me my life and my legs back.Festus had already completed his two years of training, but we spent a week together to help him adjust to meeting my needs. With Festus at my side, my fear faded and my confidence started to return. I was able to climb a flight of stairs with him walking next to me, somethingI hadn't been able to do without feeling embarrassed or needing to be last in line for 9 years. He put himself between me and other people, stood behind me so no one could come up from behind and checked doorways for me. Even during that first day, Festus gave me a positive nudge to help calm me when I started having a flashback. I can now sit through a thunderstorm without earplugs. With Festus' help, I'm able to take my kids to the park without the fear of not being able to tie their shoes. I'm able to bend down and reach that bottom shelf at the grocery store. I was able to attend a Chicago White Sox, game with my family and not have to leave every time the fireworks go off for a homerun. I'm able to live out my fatherhood because of Charlie Petrizzo. I'm not sure when I first heard of Charlie Petrizzo or Project2Heal, the man and the organization that bred and trained Festus from birth to around 12 weeks and donated him to ICAN so he could complete his training and eventually be paired with me. All I knew was that I wanted to thank this man, a man who has also turned to animals to help him heal his scars, and now shares this healing power with veterans and people with special needs by breeding and training service dogs and companions and donating them to service organizations free of charge. When I learned Charlie was going to attend the ICAN graduation celebrating the completion of Festus' training, I was thrilled. Charlie and his wife, Sandy, came all the way to Indiana from North Carolina to see how the puppy they raised had grown up to help a wounded warrior after going through his own form of 'basic training' with Charlie. I was given the opportunity to let Charlie know how much he meant to me that day. I told him about the 12 friends I lost in Iraq. I almost lost my own life, but Charlie and this very special dog gave it back to me. "

Todd Baugh is due to be censured by the Montana Supreme Court next month and faces a 31-day suspension after a judicial standards commission found he acted improperly by imposing a sentence of just 30 days against a former teacher convicted of raping his teenage student.The Montana Judicial Standards Commission also found that Baugh undermined public confidence in judges by remarking last year that the victim, who killed herself before the case could be prosecuted, had been ""as much in control of the situation"" as her rapist.Baugh said in documents filed this week with the Montana Supreme Court that he will submit to penalties it deems appropriate. But he said justices for the first time ordered a suspension when none was recommended by the judicial panel.""Thus, I think, the imposition of suspension which was not recommended by the commission is unwarranted,"" he wrote, adding, ""I will not object to you withdrawing the suspension.""The judge admitted responsibility for imposing a light jail term on Stacey Rambold for the 2007 sexual assault of Cherice Moralez.

(AP Photo/Disney, Frank Connor)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fad8250000360039756d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Carl Jung famously said that to study fairy tales is to study the anatomy of human beings. Fairy tales deserve our attention. They are our first, most powerful socializing narratives. They provide guideposts for appropriate behavior and success in life. Blockbusters reinventing or riffing off the fairy tale genre send pervasive messages to youth. Creators and reviewers of the most recent attempt to mine source material -- Disney's Maleficent -- have overlooked the most surprising and encouraging lessons that the prototypical fairy tale possesses. Dwelling in the darkness of the original ""Sleeping Beauty,"" are more humanistic, constructive and complex messages than Maleficent's producers or commentators would lead us to believe. Critics of the shadowy Sleeping Beauty adaptation eschew its modernization as tepid. Vixenish Maleficent gets a ""justifiable"" reason for her scorn. Aurora's imbued with pluck enough to make her palatable to today's audiences. Pundits argue the script circumscribes itself into the same old trope. As Rolling Stone's Peter Travers glibly put it: ""Men--those rat bastards!"" Critics summarily dismissed Maleficent's ""eye-roll worthy"" attempt at adapting fairy tale source material. This is ironic, since being dismissed was precisely what pissed Maleficent off so much. This compels our attention. Maleficent's screenwriter did the tale a disservice by planting the cause of her ire as a broken heart. The original Maleficent was more veracious, ambiguous, and interesting than a scorned-in-love woman out for revenge. The earliest written Franco-Italian versions of the Sleeping Beauty tale appeared in the fourteenth century, though its oral roots were thousands of years old. The number of godmothers varies in early iterations of the tale, but the salient point is that the Maleficent character has been forgotten -- either due to being left off a guest list, or because she's been shut up in a tower, or because when she arrives there are not enough plates or goblets for her to join. The unifying theme is that there is no place of honor for her. Scholars believe this Maleficent prototype represents an aspect of the lost goddess of antiquity. Though forgotten in Western culture, she was a crucial part of primitive civilizations. The Great Earth Mother, the feminine principle as represented in pagan cults, was forcefully repressed out of existence with Christian hegemony. The mother goddesses, sacred feminine figures with names like Isis, Kali, Ishtar, Atargatis, Coatlicue, Gaia, and Artemis, were associated with benevolent, creative, fecund, nurturing, life-giving faculties. But they also possessed the destructive faculties of nature. They could be fickle -- they could annihilate, murder, and devastate. Nature's coexisting light and dark aspects were revered as a harmonious whole in these goddesses. Early Christian clerics systematically excised the feminine from church doctrine. They committed genocide on populations worshipping the feminine principle. Centuries later, Catholic leaders disinfected the feminine principle by retrieving and reinventing the Virgin Mary. They permitted only the light aspects of the earth mother to characterize saintly Mary, qualities that human women should aspire to: benevolence, mercifulness, compassion, purity, fecundity, and at the same time its opposite -- virginity. The goddess' dark aspects were sublimated and denigrated. These repressed aspects thrived in the only place they could -- oral tales of the common folk, where they were beneath the notice of authorities. The dark aspects of the goddess were codified in the rich fairy tale crop of witches, wise-women, demonesses and evil stepmothers. When fairy tales were recorded in writing much later, their content was augmented and sanitized to entertain courtesans. In the context of Maleficent feeling underappreciated, her rage positions her not as the enemy of Aurora, but indeed Aurora's other half. Maleficent has everything that sweet, somnolent Aurora does not have -- namely, agency. The two are inextricably linked, two facets of one whole being. There is a deeper message in the original fairy tale, too, about suppression of unpalatable emotions. Abnegated darkness inevitably finds expression. The fairy tales known to us today advocate fighting evil, while the originals just as often advocate refusing to fight, running away, or doing nothing. Fealty to one's basic inner being is paramount. Responding to a difficult situation is never black and white. In making choices we must harmonize conflicting emotions and contradictory skills, such as assertiveness and compromise; caution and risk; patience and action; reason and emotion. ""Without light"" Mary Sarton says, ""nothing flowers,"" but ""without darkness, nothing comes to birth."" Like light, darkness too is a part of our nature. However narratively clumsy, adaptations like Maleficent are inherently constructive. They teach us to humanize others in a society stalled not by men themselves, but by a patriarchal legacy that's dismissed qualities of the ancient goddess. The Black Plague killed two-thirds of Europe's population. It was also the harbinger of the Enlightenment. Light and darkness coexist like a coiling helix, inextricable. For too long good and evil, right and wrong, success and failure, beauty and ugliness have been discretely categorized, one deified, the other reviled. This simplification is convenient for maintaining a status quo, but defies the complexity and messy beauty of the human condition. Integrating diverse, more holistic perspectives will help us make better individual and social choices."
