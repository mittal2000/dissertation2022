(Note: Please read this story before putting it on Facebook.),2016-06-30,"From left to right: Sen. Jeff Merkley, a pile of drug money, cannabis business owner Tyson Haworth, Rep. Earl Blumenauer",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577489401900002400218aa3.png?cache=TP0Vba2GcU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a high-profile supporter of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, has been caught on video with $70,000 in drug money. The footage, provided exclusively to The Huffington Post, also captures Rep. Earl Blumenauer, another Oregon Democrat, as well as a prominent local businessman, Tyson Haworth. The video, however, was not a sting operation run by the Drug Enforcement Administration or FBI. Instead, it's an effort to highlight a gaping and dangerous hole in national cannabis policy, if such a thing even exists. Under federal law, marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, meaning it is deemed to be highly dangerous with zero medical benefit. Even in states that have legalized cannabis, such as Oregon, possessing it remains a federal crime, as is possessing any revenue derived from dealings related to it. That puts businesspeople like Haworth, an owner of Oregon's Finest and sofresh farms, in tricky territory on a number of fronts. The most glaring danger, highlighted by the video, is that $70,000 in cash sitting on the table in front of Merkley, Haworth and Blumenauer. It's money that Haworth owes in local taxes, but he can't cut a check, because banks can't legally work with drug dealers. Banks tend to take that law seriously when rejecting mom-and-pop pot shops, but somehow manage to look the other way for Mexican drug cartels that funnel billions through those same banks. That unequal treatment means many weed shops are cash-only businesses, which raises extreme security risks for staff and owners. In one of the more sadistic policy gestures of the past few years, the DEA has even pressured security companies not to protect the workers made vulnerable by the twisted federal policy.Merkley is working to untwist that law, legislatively through the Senate, and by helping to produce videos that expose the absurdity of current federal policy. In the process, he probably committed a handful of felonies, but that's kind of the point. "

The LAPD, the report says, shines in its use of technology and social media.But not everyone agrees with that assessment. The Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter considers such praise so wrongheaded that the activists are protesting Lynch’s visit.“It’s a huge slap in the face. It’s a huge insult to black people and the people of Los Angeles,” Melina Abdullah, an organizer for Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, told The Huffington Post. “Their use of social media is really surveilling us.”Hamid Khan, the coordinator for the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, is equally baffled by the recognition from the Justice Department.The LAPD has used cutting-edge technology to create “a massive architecture of surveillance and spying and infiltration,” he said.His coalition's website lays out how the department watches the city’s residents. Stingrays and DRT boxes are used to track, intercept data on and sometimes jam mobile phones. Street cameras employ highly accurate facial recognition technology. License plate readers, drones and even police body cameras help the department know where people are and when. This wealth of data -- which is collected even on individuals who haven’t committed crimes -- fuels the LAPD's predictive policing model, which the coalition asserts is used to “crunch crime statistics and other data with algorithms to ‘predict’ when and where future crimes are most likely to occur.” Even police efforts to interact through social media can have a sinister edge. Tweeting out to the community is one thing. Tracking the online activities of people who are, after all, just exercising their rights to civil protest is another -- and Abdullah, for one, fears the latter is happening.In other words, Khan said, the LAPD -- and other police departments -- “are incorporating and codifying counterterrorism and counterinsurgency methodology and tactics into their daily policing.”The LAPD declined to comment on its use of technology to surveil citizens. A Justice Department spokesman said that Lynch was simply in the city “to highlight ways in which the LAPD uses social media and technology to positively engage the LA community.” On Wednesday, Lynch attended a briefing at the LAPD Real Time Analysis and Critical Response Division. It's the department’s first fusion center -- a place where it gathers, analyzes and shares information to scope out alleged threats. Or Khan put it, “to spy and to gather information on people.”LAPD’s participation in the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiative, for instance, has been heavily criticized for the activities that it deems to be suspicious. These include “suspected pre-operational surveillance” (using a camera or binoculars), “counter-surveillance efforts” (doubling back, evasive driving or changing your appearance), and taking measurements (counting footsteps). Any of these innocuous behaviors can lead the police to write up a secret file on an individual and upload it into a database accessible to every law enforcement agency in the country, Khan said. And the SAR program doesn't surveil the city's residents equally. Over 30 percent of suspicious activity reports involved black Los Angelenos and 50 percent of the women surveilled were black, according to an inspector general's audit of the program in January 2015. Black people comprise 9.6 percent of the city’s population.“These are the tools for racial profiling,” Khan said. Beyond the surveillance, Abdullah takes issue with the Justice Department honoring what she called “the most murderous police department in the entire country.”In 2015, LAPD officers shot 38 people -- and killed 21 of them. The number killed, according to NPR, tops the number of people shot to death by police in several of the nation's other largest cities, including Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia. The LAPD also saw an uptick of deaths in custody last year.At least eight people have been killed by on-duty LAPD officers this year, according to The Counted.Lately, officers have also been cracking down on dissent at the public meetings of the Los Angeles Police Commission, Abdullah said.“This is the first week in four weeks that there have been no arrests for showing up at the oversight body public meeting,” she said. “And so, I’m really angry that the attorney general is turning a blind eye to that.”Last week, an 81-year-old man was dragged out of the meeting and arrested for speaking off topic. The week before, someone was arrested for filming the meeting, Abdullah said. On another occasion, a civilian was detained for walking out the wrong door. Abdullah herself was arrested for going over the two-minute speaking limit, she said.The Los Angeles Police Commission did not respond to a request for comment.Considering all of these events, Abdullah said she can't understand why the attorney general would highlight the LAPD as a pillar of community policing. Initially, she thought that Lynch was actually going to present the LAPD with the Attorney General’s Distinguished Service in Community Policing award. She even started a petition calling out the police department’s “long and deep history of corruption that continues in their current practices.” But there will be no award.Still, Abdullah said of the attorney general, “It doesn’t make sense to me that, as a black woman, you can turn a blind eye to what LAPD has a history of doing and continues to do.”"

The study, titled “How Many Adults Identify as Transgender in the United States,” is also the first of its kind to provide estimates of the population in each individual state identifying as transgender. “The findings from this study are critical to current policy discussions that impact transgender people,” Jody Herman, one of the authors of the study, said in a press release. “Policy debates on access to bathrooms, discrimination and a host of other issues should rely on the best available data to assess potential impacts, including how many people may be affected.”According to the press release, the 0.6 figure is double that of estimates from a decade prior. This is likely due to a number of intersecting factors, including increased visibility of transgender people, conversations about transgender and gender-nonconforming identity in the mainstream and increased legislative protections.However, it’s important to remember that the battle for queer and transgender rights is far from over."

You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow? Welcome to Middlebrow, a weekly examination of pop culture. Sign up to receive it in your inbox weekly.Bachelor Nation has been rocked by latest Bachelor Ben Higgins’ announcement. No, not that he was considering running for Congress as a Republican (though, that too), but that he and fiancée Lauren Bushnell would be starring on their very own spinoff show, “Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After.”The reality show, which will air on Disney’s Freeform this fall, will reportedly follow the blissful couple as they prepare for marriage and their new, post-”Bachelor” lives. (Bushnell is a flight attendant, but she says she’s looking into other careers that might dovetail better with her very visible identity as a “Bachelor” star.) Though no couple from the franchise has ever gotten their very own spinoff series, fans already expected they’d at least see Ben and Lauren exchange vows on camera. Several of the most beloved “Bachelor” couples have done so. Apparently, Freeform thinks this slender, self-effacing, loveable golden couple can carry more than just a wedding special. Freeform’s executive vice president of programming and development, Karey Burke, dubbed the pair “the biggest ‘Bachelor’ couple of the last 10 years.” (I’m personally offended on behalf of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici, but it’s fine.) Still, what’s the point? “The Bachelor” focuses on a journey to love, but a show about a couple just living doesn’t have the same dramatic frisson. Sure, we had Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey on “Newlyweds,” but that was Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, and the biggest draw of the show might still have been catching Simpson asking whether tuna was fish or chicken ... you know, of the sea.But maybe Freeform is on to something. Maybe we actually love boring TV. Just look at the reality we’re already watching.“Say Yes to the Dress,” for example, features ordinary women, and a few celebrities, picking out their wedding dresses at New York bridal boutique Kleinfeld. It’s a mind-numbing concept with few twists -- most of which are themselves fairly dull, like a bride who’s struggled with body image issues or whose decadent tastes outstrip her family’s budget. Yet it’s now in its 14th season and has spawned spinoffs including “Say Yes to the Dress: Bridesmaids” and “Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta.” Forget “Bridezillas”; this low-drama wedding planning arena is where reality TV flourishes right now. Shows like “My Fair Wedding With David Tutera,” “Four Weddings,” and “Keasha’s Perfect Dress” mine a little bit of relational and familial friction for the conflict needed to feebly roll the episode forward. But basically, these shows are boring.That’s not to pick on bridal shows. MTV’s “Pimp My Ride” and real estate shows like “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition” traffic in the same no-plot spectacle. Even a show like “Sister Wives,” which boasts a dramatic-sounding concept (a polygamous family) but mostly depicts the housekeeping and logistical aspects of keeping a four-wife family running, seems too boring to be so gripping. But we watch.If they’re not selling us a story, these reality shows still have to sell us something. Typically it’s stuff, or experiences, that we crave; clothes and homes we can’t afford to even window-shop for, a picture-perfect romance that can seem impossible to find on Tinder, a truly pimped-out ride. It’s basically consumption porn, giving viewers a chance to marinate in the fantasy that satiation can be found after some relatively small or contrived obstacles have been dispatched with. This message soothes us, especially coupled with softly lit montages of everyday women trying on multi-thousand-dollar bridal gowns, man caves with built-in plasma screens, and casually well-dressed, skinny couples decorating nurseries for their first tykes. The aesthetic indulgence resembles that of QVC, without the risk that you’ll wake up in the morning with a headache and the vague, foreboding sense that you’re going to have $400 worth of gold-tone clip-on earrings delivered to your home in five to seven business days.Even the lack of drama itself can be soothing, making it a breeze for viewers to gulp down episode after episode of twist-free, plot-free, low-energy programming, a gentle immersion in a shinier, happier version of our lives.When it comes to Ben and Lauren, it remains to be seen whether people will actually watch “Happily Ever After” -- my “Bachelor” fan coworkers and I all shared the admission that we expected it to be a snooze. “I’ll probably watch it on Hulu,” offered one. It won’t be event TV like “The Bachelor,” that is. Neither is “Say Yes to the Dress,” but people are watching -- enough for the shows to continue getting made. If enough of us binge-watch “Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After” on Hulu or our DVR, or comfortably doze through a marathon on Freeform some Sunday afternoon, that might be all it takes.Follow Claire Fallon on Twitter: @ClaireEFallon​"

He found online fame this week after assisting a student who brought her baby to an entrepreneurship class. A collection of viral photos show that Professor Kahi offered to wear the baby on his back when she wouldn’t stop crying.The professor told The Huffington Post that it’s fairly common for female students to bring their babies to class. Those who have “proven social and financial problems” are permitted to do this, he explained.That day, the young mom left the room three times to try to calm her crying baby, but her efforts were to no avail. So, the teacher offered some assistance. “She was very embarrassed, and everyone could notice that,” Kahi recalled. “Therefore I decided to give her a hand so that she could follow the lecture. I just asked to carry the baby which she accepted. Then, I put the baby on my back to get my hands free and continue the lecture.”The little one immediately calmed down, soothed by his pacing back and forth, and eventually fell asleep, he said. “My student told me she was very touched by this gesture, and that she was very surprised because there is generally some distance between students and teachers,” he recalled, adding that he believes teachers should work to create a sense of solidarity and social ties with their students.Professor Kahi told BBC that many other students were surprised to see him engaged in babywearing. Some started to laugh and several took photos, which later appeared on a dating-themed Facebook page for African college students.

Only the far-right National Front is calling for a vote on EU membership.""Why organize such a tumult and confrontation if it's not to leave the EU? Lies, simplifications, excesses and even the violence we saw in the referendum campaign in Britain were not enough for those sorcerer's apprentices?"" Hollande told Les Echos daily, when asked whether there should be a referendum in France.Many in France are increasingly disillusioned with Europe which they see as too pro-market and not protective enough, making the outcome of such a referendum hard to predict. In 2005, a proposed new EU constitution was blocked by referendums in France and the Netherlands.Some 55 percent of French voters do not want a referendum on EU membership while 45 percent think it would be a good idea, a survey by Elabe pollsters showed on Wednesday.The vote on Europe in France will be the presidential election, Hollande told Les Echos. ""The British experience will then be an example - or rather a counter-example,"" he said."

In a statement, the Taliban said around 150 police had been killed and dozens more injured.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the first attack targeted a bus carrying police cadets and instructors. Then, as rescuers and emergency services arrived, a second bomber rammed his car, packed with explosives, into their vehicles, killing dozens.The attacks were immediately condemned by NATO's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan as well as President Ashraf Ghani, who called the incident a ""crime against humanity"".""While Muslims are busy praying during this holy month of Ramadan, Taliban keep committing reprehensible crimes by killing innocent people and spreading fear and terror,"" he said in a statement.He ordered an inquiry into how the Taliban could mount an apparently carefully planned operation, despite pledges of a security clampdown in Kabul following recent attacks.Beyond the immediate impact, the attacks cast further doubt on any resumption of peace talks with the Taliban.Even before the death of former leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour in a U.S. drone strike last month, prospects appeared remote after the Taliban refused to join talks sponsored by the United States, China and Pakistan.Under new leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada the insurgents have made clear they will continue attacks on the Western-backed government, and maintained their demand for international forces to quit the country.Last week, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan warned of the danger of a new spiral of violence following recent suicide attacks and highway kidnappings.The latest suicide bombings come 10 days after 14 people died in an attack on a bus carrying Nepali security guards working for the Canadian embassy in Kabul.In April, 64 people were killed in a Taliban attack on a security services facility in Kabul, the deadliest such bombing since 2011.(Additional reporting by Jibran Ahmad in PESHAWAR; writing by James Mackenzie; Editing by Nick Macfie and Clarence Fernandez)"

The congressional candidates who make it into this elite recruitment and training program are the next generation of the GOP -- the freshest, most promising leaders.This year, the average age of those Young Guns is 49, and the 11 candidates still largely look like the old guard: mostly white, mostly male. ""To reach the Young Guns stage of our committee's recruitment program, candidates must meet our high standards of achievement to ensure a path to victory on Election Day,"" NRCC Chairman Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said. ""As a committee, we are working to help elect Republicans to maintain our record breaking majority in the House of Representatives and further put into action our ideas that will build a more confident America.""There's no age requirement to be in the Young Guns program. But when it was started in 2008, it was meant to showcase a Republican Party full of new people and new ideas -- best symbolized by the relatively fresh (but still white and male) faces of Reps. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). The three wrote a book in 2010, saying they were ""changing the face of the Republican Party.""This year, the youngest candidate so far is Justin Fareed, the 27-year-old raising a significant amount of money to replace outgoing Rep. Lois Capps (D-Calif.) in the state's 24th district. But the program also includes Amie Hoeber, a former Pentagon official in Ronald Reagan's administration who at 74 is making her first run for office in Maryland's 6th district. Republican John Faso, 63, won his primary in New York's 19th district Tuesday night and will face off against progressive favorite Zephyr Teachout.The Republican Party has struggled to attract young voters, with the average age of a GOP voter significantly higher than the average Democrat. It's a problem that the Republican National Committee itself has acknowledged. After the 2012 elections, the RNC put out a much-discussed ""autopsy report"" about what it needed to do to survive, concluding, ""Younger voters are increasingly put off by the GOP. A post-election survey of voters ages 18-29 in the battleground states of Virginia, Ohio, Florida, and Colorado found that Republicans have an almost 1:2 favorable/unfavorable rating. Democrats have an almost 2:1 favorable rating.""It seems like the ""Young Guns"" may be ripe for retirement."

26,POLITICS,Can An Openly Gay Man Be Elected Senator In Kim Davis' Backyard?,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-gray-kentucky_us_5773f9c6e4b0eb90355d1608,Jim Gray makes his case to the people of Kentucky.,2016-06-29,"Gray is running against U.S. Senator Rand Paul, seen here addressing the National Rifle Association during its annual meeting in Louisville, Kentucky, in May.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5773fa351800002500fa30ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GLASGOW, Ky. -- I met Lexington Mayor Jim Gray earlier this month at his family's farm near his childhood home of Glasgow, an hour east of Bowling Green, Kentucky. It's a lovely property, well-appointed and surrounded by lush, rolling hills -- Gray told me the family first settled in the area following the War of 1812 and had eagerly snatched up the property several years back. The Gray farm is the sort of place you picture when you hear banjo-heavy tunes about front porches, summer breezes and sundresses. It would be unprofessional to publish the address, but trust me that it sits on a street whose name could be the title of a Ricky Skaggs album. If the setting for our meeting wasn't intentional, it was certainly a happy accident. Most politicians want to play up their local roots -- the New England pol who dons a Red Sox hat whenever possible; the Louisiana governor who wants to know who dat?; the Iowa senator who considers every moment an opportunity lost if it's not spent noshing on fried butter. Even by those standards, however, I was drowning in the nostalgia of Gray's Old Kentucky Home. On the trail, Gray, the Democratic challenger in the race for Republican Rand Paul's Senate seat, has made considerable to-do about his Kentucky roots, hoping to draw a contrast with Paul, who moved to the Bluegrass State as an adult.""I'm a seventh-generation Kentuckian,"" Gray told a gathering of Democrats in the western part of the state the night before. ""I will not forget you."" He described to them his family's deep ties to Kentucky politics, relaying anecdotes about family members of yore and their work behind the scenes in the state's public sphere. The stories did double duty as an implicit rebuke of Paul -- the kind of oblique shade-casting that only politicians and ""Real Housewives"" cast members can really pull off.""We grew up around a dinner table where my father was talking about business on one end and my mom was talking politics,"" Gray told me during a lengthy and largely nostalgic discussion of his childhood. ""And my mom would say, 'It's not nice to talk about business at the dinner table.'""Standard political calculus aside, I couldn't help but wonder if Gray emphasizes his roots so often because of some insecurity about another aspect of his life, one that some Kentucky voters might view with suspicion: his sexual orientation.Gray came out publicly in 2005, when he was planning a run for Lexington's city council. Rumors about his sexuality had swirled in the city's political and business circles for years, fueled in part by a failed mayoral bid in 2002. Gray told me he started coming out to family and friends in the 1990s and was encouraged by their warm reception. Voters in Lexington seemed to share that sentiment, or at least weren't put off by Gray's orientation, electing him to the city council in 2006 and elevating him to mayor in 2010.""One thing I found was that what people care about is results, and that's been really encouraging,"" he said. ""I felt that to be authentic, [coming out] was essential."" Acceptance in the comparatively progressive environs of Lexington is one thing, but most of Kentucky more closely resembles Glasgow. Here, just outside the orbit of more liberal Bowling Green, Christian radio dominates the airwaves, and most of the stores that line Glasgow's historic downtown are closed on Sundays. In the middle of those picturesque streets stands a monument commemorating the Confederate war dead -- this in a state that never actually seceded from the Union.What was it like growing up as a closeted gay man in such a place? Even before I finished asking the question, a bashful grin crept across Gray's face and he shot an aide a knowing look.""It was very challenging,"" he said, carefully choosing his words. ""Being in Kentucky, I think an element of the challenge was represented there, but there's no escaping or illusions about the challenges that it presented at the time."" Gray, 62, made his money working for his family's construction company. Along the way, he developed a solid reputation in the state's business and political communities. He's not the sort of character you'd expect to find atop the construction field -- a zero-sum world dominated by brusque dealmakers, and one not exactly known for its open-mindedness about gender and sexuality. Gray's clean-cut appearance and gentle bearing are more reminiscent of a dentist or a four-star hotel concierge than someone whose business concerns include concrete and rebar.I feel a bit strange asking Gray about growing up closeted in this part of the country. In 2016, with same-sex marriage codified by the Supreme Court and openly LGBT Americans more and more visible in society, it seems somehow uncouth to ask such a personal question of a public figure who doesn't hide his orientation -- who, indeed, bravely came out in a time when the question of civil rights for LGBT Americans wasn't nearly as settled.Yet this is Kentucky, the state that gave the world Kim Davis, the Rowan County clerk whose refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples made her the face of sweater-clad homophobes everywhere. Davis' crusade garnered such worldwide attention that at one point she somehow finagled a meeting with Pope Francis. In 2014, when a federal judge ordered Kentucky to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages, then-Gov. Steve Beshear (D) challenged the ruling. Again, this was a Democratic governor. And my meeting with Gray took place nearly a week after Omar Mateen opened fire on a gay club in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people in America's deadliest terror attack since Sept. 11 -- a horrifying reminder that homophobia can produce far more tragic outcomes than the discomfort of a local bureaucrat in a far-flung part of Kentucky.""There's an enormous amount of empathy that anyone in the LGBT community has for the victims -- sympathy and empathy,"" Gray told me. ""And outrage and anger, as well."" Only a few days before, Gray had held a press conference in Lexington to discuss the Orlando attack. With the nation rallying around the LGBT community like never before, it seemed a perfect opportunity for the candidate to open up about a side of himself that Kentucky voters may have previously looked askance at -- the sort of speech that goes viral on social media under headlines like ""OPENLY GAY CANDIDATE GIVES EMOTIONAL TRIBUTE TO ORLANDO VICTIMS.""Yet Gray made no mention of his orientation, or how it may have influenced his understanding of the event. He was under no obligation to do so, of course, but the decision was notable given his previous openness about the topic. Speaking in the aftermath of Orlando, he appeared no more somber or introspective than if he were addressing, say, the passing of a Hall of Fame athlete. He offered his condolences, called for stricter oversight of gun purchases by suspected terrorists and lambasted Paul for an allegedly weak-kneed approach to terrorism. He stumbled on several occasions, including when a reporter asked about Mateen having been cleared from the terror watch list. It was an altogether forgettable event.""In some respects, my immediate reaction was both as a member of the LGBT community, and also [as a mayor], the challenges it presents to [Orlando],"" Gray told me.In fairness to Gray, he might have delivered the exact same speech even if he'd been running for Senate in California or Vermont, simply because of his particular temperament. Not so long ago, Gray might have been described as ""private"" or a ""longtime bachelor"" -- loaded terms that reporters and obituary writers once used to hint at a closeted subject's sexual orientation. But Gray, despite his openness about his sexuality, doesn't seem like the type to talk at length about the more private aspects of his existence. He grew up in a time and place where it could be ruinous for a gay man to live openly, and perhaps as a result of his years in the closet, he's far more inclined than the average politician to deflect the conversation away from himself.That could actually be detrimental to Gray's hopes of taking Paul's Senate seat. No one, least of all Gray himself, expects his campaign to be anything but an uphill climb. And if he's going to succeed in an increasingly Republican state in a cycle dominated by Donald Trump, he's going to need to stand out somehow.""Jim Gray is not well known and you've got to get people's attention,"" said Al Cross, a columnist for the Louisville Courier-Journal and director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky. ""He's not a compelling personality, but he does have a good record as mayor of Lexington.""Which raises a counterintuitive question: Do the Democrats need a gayer candidate in Kentucky?""I think those beliefs have been moderated in the last few years,"" Cross said of Kentuckians' views on homosexuality. Besides, he added, anyone who would vote on the basis of a candidate's orientation is ""probably not going to vote for a Democrat, anyway.""Another issue is the collapse of support for Hillary Clinton in Kentucky -- a factor that could suppress turnout for Gray. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, won the state in both 1992 and 1996, and though Kentucky has become more Republican since then, the Clintons remained popular well into the 21st century. In 2008, Hillary trounced then-Sen. Barack Obama by nearly 40 points in the Democratic presidential primary here.However, local opinion of Clinton dropped sharply after she told a crowd in Columbus, Ohio, in March that ""we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" Though she later apologized, the damage was done. She barely eked out a win against Sen. Bernie Sanders in the state's Democratic primary, losing counties that eight years ago had supported her by overwhelming margins.No one ever expected Clinton to win the state in November, coal comments or not. But Kentucky voters aren't averse to splitting tickets, and Clinton's remarks will likely depress Democratic turnout in a state reeling from the collapse of the coal industry. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, meanwhile, has actively courted the coal industry, donning a miner's helmet during a West Virginia rally in May. ""I have no illusions about this being a challenging race,"" Gray said. But the deck isn't fully stacked against Gray. When it comes to politics, Kentucky is a notoriously weird place, and that could work in his favor this November. The state continues to elect Democrats down-ballot, even as it tilts Republican in presidential elections -- a legacy of its post-Reconstruction hostility to the party of Lincoln and its fond memories of the New Deal and the Great Society, particularly in the Appalachian east. What's more, Gray's family has deep ties throughout the state, and while he's not the world's most electrifying speaker -- something campaign officials readily admit -- he works a room well and has no objection to fundraising. These characteristics are particularly valuable in Kentucky, where county-level political operations are still largely run by Democrats who might be more inclined to get to work for a candidate who can engage with them. And with control of the U.S. Senate in the balance, an openly gay candidate in Kentucky might be just the angle to entice contributions from coastal donors, whom the campaign is more than happy to court.""Kentuckians expect to see the candidates that are running. You have to be able to raise money, you have to get out over the state yourself,"" said Beshear, the former governor, in an interview. ""You've got a candidate in Jim that can raise money, who can be a self-funder to a certain extent."" But this is still very much Rand Paul's race to lose, as the Gray campaign and its allies acknowledge. And in a year when turnout may be down in traditionally red states due to Donald Trump's low approval numbers, polls suggest that Kentucky voters are nevertheless open to Making America Great Again. Gray is an undeniably strong candidate, but the question is whether Kentuckians will be able to hear that through all the noise."

As The Hollywood Reporter notes, of the 683 possible members, 46 percent were women and 41 percent were people of color. If all individuals accept their invitations, the demographic of the Academy could shift from 75 percent male to 73 percent and from 95 percent white to 89 percent. While the difference in numbers seems small when written out, it's nice to see the Academy taking proper steps to maintain a more diverse organization. It's important to note that the members of the Academy are the ones who vote for the Oscars, meaning they ultimately decide who gets nominated and who wins. If the organization is more diverse, the hope is that diversity will be visible in the list of nominees and winners. Stars like John Boyega, Emma Watson and Freida Pinto are among the new crop of invitees, which includes 28 Oscar winners and 98 nominees. Furthermore, 283 of the invitees are considered international members who represent 59 countries. Other members of Hollywood, such as Michael B. Jordan, who was snubbed for his role in ""Creed"" at last year's Academy Awards ceremony, and Ryan Coogler, who directed the ""Rocky"" spinoff, were also among those who received invitations. Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs and CEO Dawn Hudson have long been pushing the organization to include more women, minorities and international filmmakers. Last year, as THR reports, the Academy sent out 322 invitations, which was a solid increase from the 271 sent out the year prior. Before that, it was normal to see less than 200 new members join the organization per year. Since 2014, there has been plenty of public outcry about the Oscars lack of representation. At the 87th Oscars in 2015, not a single actor of color was nominated for an award in any of the four main acting categories. As a result, the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite began trending. This year's crop of nominees, which was also startlingly white, only made the backlash worse. Following the nomination announcements for the 2016 ceremony, Boone Isaacs addressed the controversy. ""Of course I am disappointed,” she told Deadline. “But this is not to take away the greatness [of the films nominated]. This has been a great year in film, it really has across the board.”Then, in an official statement, Boone Isaacs vowed to do her part in making a difference. ""I’d like to acknowledge the wonderful work of this year’s nominees. While we celebrate their extraordinary achievements, I am both heartbroken and frustrated about the lack of inclusion,” Boone Isaacs said in the statement, which was released on Twitter. “This is a difficult but important conversation, and it’s time for big changes. The Academy is taking dramatic steps to alter the makeup of our membership.”Plenty of celebrities also spoke out about the issue. Actor David Oyelowo, who was notably snubbed for his performance as Martin Luther King Jr. in 2014's “Selma,"" spoke out about the lack of diversity at the Oscars and slammed the award show during a gala honoring Boone Isaacs in January.“The Academy has a problem. It’s a problem that needs to be solved,” he said, adding, “For 20 opportunities to celebrate actors of color, actresses of color, to be missed last year is one thing; for that to happen again this year is unforgivable.” Oyelowo continued, “This institution doesn’t reflect its president and it doesn’t reflect this room. I am an Academy member and it doesn’t reflect me, and it doesn’t reflect this nation.”Meanwhile, other stars like Jada Pinkett Smith, Spike Lee and Michael Moore all decided not to watch or attend this year's ceremony.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) defeated her opponent in New York's primaries Tuesday night, although another Sanders-supported candidate -- a Social Security expert in central New York -- lost his election.Zephyr Teachout soundly bested organic farmer Will Yandik in New York's 19th Congressional District on Tuesday. Although she received a boost from Sanders' endorsement, Teachout has long been a progressive favorite and was already known statewide after running against incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in the 2014 Democratic primary. Although Cuomo won -- 62 percent to 34 percent -- the fact that Teachout pulled so much support away from a sitting governor was impressive. She had no previous electoral experience, spent nearly no money and had a bare-bones campaign operation. In that election, Teachout did particularly well in the Hudson Valley, where the moderate 19th District is located.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not endorse in the race, but many Democrats were excited about Yandik because of his ties to the district and his appeal to independents. He said he was in regular touch with the DCCC. Teachout will face Republican John Faso in November to replace outgoing Rep. Chris Gibson (R-N.Y.). Sanders' candidate didn't fare as well in New York's 24th District. There, Eric Kingson lost to Colleen Deacon, who had the backing of the DCCC and both the state's U.S. senators. Deacon worked for the mayor of Syracuse and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), and often stressed her experience as a single mother living on food stamps. She will face incumbent Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) in the fall.Kingson co-founded the national organization Social Security Works and started the Strengthen Social Security Coalition, which comprises more than 300 organizations focused on strengthening and expanding Social Security. He has also called for a single-payer health care system, which has been a signature issue for Sanders. Kingson faced more of an uphill battle than Teachout, but he received an extra boost in the form of a campaign rally appearance by Sanders in Syracuse last week. Sanders said Congress needed members ""who have the guts to stand up to powerful special interests.""Sanders has lent his high profile and considerable fundraising might to a number of progressive down-ballot candidates who he hopes will join him in Washington to push a progressive agenda. Some of them, such as Kingson and Teachout, waged direct challenges to the Democratic establishment in primaries against candidates endorsed by groups like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Sanders' most notable endorsement is in Florida, where he's backing Tim Canova, a professor and political novice, against Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.). New York's 19th and 24th Districts both are high on the Democratic Party's list of districts they believe they can flip to blue in November. Wins by people like Teachout and Jamie Raskin -- the progressive Maryland state senator who won the primary in his heavily Democratic district in April -- reflect the populist mood of the electorate and could give Sanders more allies in Congress next year."

The fire devastated their home, but if Bailey hadn’t been around, it could have been much, much worse.“[Randy] was in his room with the door shut, listening to music, cleaning his room,” Robert said. “He had no idea, he didn’t smell anything because it started on the other side of the house.”But Bailey noticed, bolting upstairs and barking frantically outside of his door — something Robert said was “not normal” for her. Randy followed Bailey downstairs and found an overwhelming amount of smoke.That’s where Randy saving Bailey’s life comes in. The frightened, confused dog ran into her kennel to hide, and the man had to pull her out and carry her out of the house.“It wasn’t till then that Randy realized the entire house was engulfed in flames,” Robert on a GoFundMe page set up to help with the family’s expenses.

Mamie Bittner, a spokeswoman for the Architect of the Capitol, said a recent water sample analysis showed that lead concentrations in the Cannon House Office Building's water exceeded the federal standard of 15 parts per billion.""While these tests continue, in an abundance of caution, we have turned off all drinking water sources and office-provided water filtration units in the Cannon House Office Building,"" Bittner said in an email.""Restrooms and kitchen sinks will be available for non-drinking use and bottled water will be available throughout the building,"" Bittner wrote. ""Building operations will not be impacted. This situation only impacts the Cannon building.""Lead is a poisonous metal that can cause miscarriages if pregnant women ingest it, and can damage the brains of young children. Cannon is one of three large buildings on the Capitol's south side, where members of the House of Representatives keep offices. One member with an office there is Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) -- the congressman from Flint, Michigan, where lead has poisoned the water since 2014. ""Congress has so far failed to act on Flint aid and now some Members of Congress have had their own water shut off due to high lead levels in their Washington offices,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""Lead is a dangerous neurotoxin and high levels of lead in water anywhere is a public health emergency,"" Kildee said. ""It is long past time that Congress get serious about this health threat. Helping Flint families ought to be as much of a priority as ensuring safe water on Capitol Hill.""Proposals to help Flint and other cities replace lead water pipes haven't cleared the U.S. House or Senate. One Republican who has vocally opposed the assistance said Congress shouldn't nationalize a local water problem. As many as 10 million American homes and buildings get water from pipes made of lead, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Federal law requires local water systems to monitor the water for its lead content and also its corrosiveness, since more corrosiveness means more lead can leach into the water. The EPA is considering more aggressive requirements about replacing lead pipes, something water utilities aren't often forced to do.The historic neighborhood around the U.S. Capitol in Washington has lots of pipes made from lead -- which wasn't banned from plumbing materials until the 1980s, despite the known dangers of lead exposure. In the early 2000s, water treatment changes made the city's water more corrosive, and its lead content spiked dramatically.Bittner couldn't provide additional information about the source of the lead in Cannon, such as whether it came from the building's internal plumbing or from service lines that connect the building to a water main."

The companies were fighting to maintain the ability to rent public lands rich with coal at a discount.Over the same time period, a group of nine coal companies paid executives more than $1 billion.The data was compiled from public filings by the Western Values Project, an advocacy group, and released in a report on Tuesday. As Bloomberg reported, the ""group is pressing regulators to overhaul the program by making transactions more transparent and raising costs to better match the value of coal extracted from private land."" In January, the Obama administration declared a halt to new coal leases on public land while it considers the future of that policy.The report highlights how coal companies have been successful in cutting employee benefits as part of the bankruptcy process, while maintaining large compensation packages for executives. For instance, as part of its 2013 bankruptcy, Patriot Coal cut employee benefits from $1.3 billion to $400 million, while paying Patriot executives $6.9 million the same year, the report says.Similarly, the report notes, ""last year, Alpha Natural Resources asked for permission from a bankruptcy judge to cut medical and life insurance benefits for their retirees while also asking the court to approve $11.9 million in executive bonuses. Both the cuts to benefits and the executive bonuses were approved.""The U.S. coal mining industry has gone through a wave of high-profile bankruptcies. Peabody Energy, the world’s largest private coal company, filed for bankruptcy in April. Fellow coal giants Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal and Walter Energy have each filed for bankruptcy since January 2015. More than three dozen smaller coal companies have gone under in the last four years.While the industry has blamed the Obama administration's clean air rules for its woes, U.S. coal companies in fact are failing due to falling demand from China, a natural gas boom in the U.S. and a string of debt-fueled mergers."

In the wake of the U.K.’s historic, market-shaking vote, financial heavyweights, commenters and the stock market itself are sending a signal that maybe, possibly, there might be hope that Britain’s departure from the European Union will not happen. The vote, after all, wasn’t binding, and it will be up to the next British government to decide if the country formally withdraws from the E.U.Then there’s the fact that the London FTSE 100 stock index has made back up the losses it incurred after the surprise “leave” vote. (The pound, however remains deeply depressed against the U.S. dollar.)There are also finance industry executives who have come out to calm fears, perhaps in hope as much as belief. Larry Fink, the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, told Bloomberg TV that he wasn’t sure the Brexit would happen. Uncertainty, he said, was the only thing he could be sure of. Pressed on what he thought would happen, Fink said there is “plenty of time to find a less harmful"" alternative to leaving the E.U.David Rubenstein, founder and co-CEO of private equity giant Carlyle, told Bloomberg TV that economic self-interest alone would keep British politicians from accepting the results of the 52-48 vote. “When it becomes clear that the terms of the exit are so expensive,” he said, “I think the next prime minister of England [sic] will not invoke Article 50,” referring to the binding notice that a country wishes to leave the E.U. “I’m reasonably optimistic that, in the end, Britain will come to its sense, or the government leaders will come to their senses, and recognize that a Brexit is not in anybody’s interests.”The Financial Times’ Gideon Rachman looks at another kind of self-interest -- the sheepish reaction of Boris Johnson, London’s former mayor and a prominent ""leave"" campaigner -- and is hopeful. Johnson, Rachman reasons, just wants to be prime minister. That door has been opened by the resignation of his club mate and fellow Tory David Cameron, who was on the ""remain"" side. Rachman writes that if Johnson becomes PM, he’ll be satisfied with a slight renegotiation of immigration terms and leave it at that.But even that scenario, which looks like the best hope for ""remain"" supporters, would need a drawn-out set of negotiations over arcane matters to end in a very specific way.And regardless of whether that outcome occurs, Fink says there are already indications of cash-hoarding and a slowing of the types of investments that drive economic growth. In other words, even if the Brexit doesn’t happen, it’s already done harm."

She thought the stimulant would be out of her body by then, according to a police report that Tucson News Now obtained.The new mom said the child appeared extremely lethargic and difficult to keep awake about a half an hour after the feeding.They took the child to a nearby hospital where police say the parents refused to allow a blood examination. The couple took the baby to a second hospital where they again refused the test. A urine analysis was eventually conducted that revealed the dangerous substance, authorities say.The pair initially denied cocaine use as well as having any knowledge of how the child was exposed, reported Tucson Weekly, citing the police report.They later confessed to having snorted the drug. Police searched their home and uncovered a little less than 2 grams of white powder that tested positive for cocaine. Somchai confessed to using cocaine every six weeks or so, police allege.Child protective services took the baby and gave the child to her grandmother to care for, Tucson News Now reported.The couple’s attorney put their behavior down to a brief lapse in judgment.""It would be a gross, gross, gross injustice if even the mention of prison time [is made],"" Michael Piccarreta told an Arizona Star reporter outside of a courtroom Monday. ""I anticipate they will demonstrate that they have learned a very hard, embarrassing lesson and that this will become a footnote in their life, not a chapter.""Piccarreta said the child's mother is permitted to have 24/7 contact with her daughter, while the father has been permitted 12 hours per day.Somchai was a reporter at Tucson News Now before the incident. Krystin previously worked for nearby KGUN 9 News and earlier competed in the 2013 Miss Arizona USA pageant."

CLAIRSVILLE, Ohio -- Donald Trump on Tuesday evening declared his fondness for torture, likened a new trade deal to the “rape of our country,” and joked with a man wanting a job by offering him one if he agreed to a 10 percent pay cut.In other words: If last week was Trump's “pivot” to becoming a more serious presidential candidate, it’s been followed by a pivot right back.The 48-minute speech to several thousand supporters crowding the Ohio University Eastern Campus’s gym was trademark Trump, meandering across topics ranging from his various successes, to the “stupidity” of the country’s leaders, to his views of torture in the fight against ISIS.On waterboarding -- a technique that makes subjects feel they're drowning -- for example, Trump recounted what he'd said at a Republican primary debate. “I like it a lot, but I don’t think it’s tough enough,” he said to cheers and laughter.Trump spoke hours after suicide bombers struck Istanbul's Ataturk airport, an attack that has left at least 41 people dead. He mentioned the incident near the start of his speech by pointing out that ""something very bad"" was going on in the world, and that America had to wake up to it. ""Can you imagine them sitting around the table or wherever they're eating their dinner, talking about the Americans don't do waterboarding and yet we chop off heads?"" he said. ""They probably think we're weak, we're stupid, we don't know what we're doing, we have no leadership. You know, you have to fight fire with fire.""At one point, he claimed Syrian Christians who want asylum in the United States face far tougher hurdles than Syrian Muslims. At another, he asserted that weaponry provided to and then abandoned by U.S.-backed fighters and subsequently picked up by ISIS was somehow better than what U.S. soldiers have.“And we fight the enemy with better equipment than we have. Their equipment is newer and better than what we have,” he said.One notable omission: Any mention of Monday's Supreme Court ruling that struck down strict abortion clinic restrictions in Texas. Trump, who once favored abortion rights, but said when he entered the GOP race that he had changed his position, didn't issue a statement on the ruling Monday, when it was being roundly condemned by anti-abortion groups.Even that, though, did not appear to bother fans at Tuesday's rally.Robert McCracken, an 80-year-old retiree from neighboring Mt. Pleasant who wore a small cross on his shirt collar, called Trump a “common-sense Republican,” and said his election was the only thing that can save the country. “We’ll have the end of the American republic,” he said. “He has to win.”And Bernard Merritt, 22, called Trump’s remarks “amazing” as he showed off a signed Trump hand towel -- the payoff for arriving five hours early and getting a spot next to the stage. “I fall in love with him every time he opens his mouth,” said the cellphone repair business owner, who drove an hour from a suburb of Steubenville to attend. “I’m going to put it in a frame and hang it up,” he said of the hand towel.Unlike Trump’s rallies earlier in the primary season that drew a fair number of uncommitted or curious voters, his eastern Ohio speech appeared to be pulling in primarily hard-core supporters.Brenda Johnson, 62, arose at 5 a.m. in her home in a Cincinnati suburb to drive four hours at attend her fourth Trump rally. She was in the entry line by 9 a.m. -- 10 hours before the start of the event. She said she has been a supporter since she watched a Trump speech months ago in Las Vegas about building a wall on the southern border to stop illegal immigration. “I about jumped out of my chair. Because finally somebody was saying what needs to be said,"" she said.Belmont County, which includes St. Clairsville, is among the many rural, sparsely populated ones in Ohio that supported Trump over native son and statewide winner Gov. John Kasich in the March 15 primary. The area is reliably Republican, and went for Mitt Romney in 2012 by 8 points, even as President Barack Obama narrowly carried the state.It is among the Midwestern Rust Belt states that Trump’s campaign believes he can win -- along with Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- because of all the manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the decades, and which Trump attributes to bad trade agreements.“I’m not angry at Japan. I’m not angry at China. I’m not angry at Mexico,” Trump said Tuesday. “I’m angry at our leaders, who are so stupid.”Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.This article has been updated with information about Tuesday's attack in Turkey."

They estimated its length to be at least 10 feet,” the post read.Police noted that the snake is not native to the area, and suspect its former owner released it.The creepy sighting came nearly a week after someone reported seeing a snake “as long as a truck” with a head “the size of a small ball” near a playground in the same area.The officer who spotted the reptile on Wednesday wasn't able to get a good picture of it because it was so early in the morning. Fortunately, creative members of the public have stepped in to provide their own drawings and alerts.There's even a mock Twitter account for the elusive reptile. ""Wessie P. Thon"" recently tweeted that police will ""never take me alive!""Police say members of the public should not try to capture the snake themselves if they see it.“We ask the public to be mindful of the snake’s presence in the area and immediately report any sightings so we can remove the animal from the river,” the police department stated.Because the animal just polished off a large meal, it’s expected to remain dormant for a few days."
41,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders' Endgame Is Increasingly Bewildering To Team Clinton,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-convention_us_5773f0f4e4b0352fed3e97f7,The Vermont senator is raising the possibility of some convention disruptions.,2016-06-29,Sanders' push for a Democratic platform cast in his image faces pushback from both Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democrats have for weeks treated the still-operational presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with a mix of deference and caution, worrying about too strongly pushing the occasionally irascible senator and his legion of devoted followers.But as time has passed and the party's convention nears, supporters of Hillary Clinton really want to know what Sanders' endgame actually is. The question has been prompted by some recent muddled messaging from Sanders himself. The senator has said he'll vote for Clinton, but is declining to actually endorse her candidacy. On Tuesday, he raised the specter of convention disorder over the nuts and bolts of the party platform, all while insisting he will do everything in his power to ensure that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump loses. The Democratic Party is eager to see that loss, but has begun wondering whether ideological disputes and bruised egos may get in the way. ""So far [Sanders] has been riding a wave of good feelings in the sense he ran an incredible campaign,"" said former Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), who served with Sanders and Clinton but has endorsed the latter. ""But that has a pretty short shelf life and then people start looking at you through a different lens, and that lens is: Are you a team player and do you have the larger picture in mind or are you just focused on yourself?"" Conrad said. ""At some point, pretty soon, he crosses the threshold. He may have already crossed it.""Sanders' campaign did not return requests for comment. But those who know the senator say that the simplest explanation for his current pursuits is, in his typical fashion, the right one: He wants to change the Democratic Party, from the way it nominates its candidates to the policies it pursues. ""Bernie is trying to do exactly what he says he is trying to do. It's in every one of his statements. He is making sure the concerns he has raised are taken into account for the future of the Democratic Party,"" said former Sen. Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), who worked with Sanders for a short period of time. ""The easiest answer with Bernie is to listen what he says because what he says is what he means,"" he added. ""It is remarkable working with him. You didn't have to spend a lot of time figuring out what he was saying or what he meant. It was a pleasure being around him."" And Sanders has been around. Since voting in the Democratic primary concluded, he hasn't receded far from the spotlight. The stadium-sized rallies are over, but he has campaigned for like-minded progressives, sent fundraising emails to elect allies, pushed for platform changes through his delegates and, lately, has taken to the op-ed pages of the major newspapers. The senator delivered his latest missive on Wednesday morning: He sent a warning shot to Democrats via The New York Times, writing that Britain's vote to exit the European Union exposed an underappreciated anger in the electorate over income inequality and trade deals.That Sanders remains a player in the party is clearly not in dispute. The question Democrats -- especially those in the Clinton universe -- are grappling with, is to what end?""I'm confused by it,"" conceded Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a longtime Clinton ally. ""If he wants to speak in primetime at the convention, then he has to suspend his campaign. If I was leading the movement and I wanted to convince the American people that the movement was correct, then I'd want to speak in primetime. But apparently he must not want to because he hasn't thrown in the towel."" With weeks to go before the party convenes in Philadelphia, Sanders' role in that coronation of Clinton remains a mystery. He said Tuesday on MSNBC that he was taking his campaign to the convention floor in an effort to affect the platform. ""Politics is not a baseball game with winners or losers,"" Sanders said at the time. ""What politics is about is whether we protect the needs of millions of people in this country who are hurting."" But changing the platform with the dramatic stripes that would satisfy the senator and his supporters seems unlikely. The party, for example, will be hard-pressed to formally disavow trade deals that its leader (President Barack Obama, not Clinton) still supports. ""You can't have a platform that will embarrass the president,"" said one prominent Democratic National Committee official. Sanders' leverage seems limited in other ways as well. The portion of the liberal base that is withholding its support for Clinton has decreased in recent polls. That's been aided in part by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) endorsing the former secretary of state -- although the Clinton camp believes that 10 percent to 15 percent of Sanders' supporters were never Democrats to begin with and won't vote for Clinton simply because other progressives are on board.  Many of Sanders' prominent endorsers have switched their support to Clinton as well. And according to Democratic sources, the Clinton campaign has been working behind the scenes to try to limit the prospects of convention chaos: Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook has spoken repeatedly with Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, in addition to meeting with Sanders' delegates in Vermont in an attempt to earn their support.Rendell, who is chairing the convention, said he has also been working with the Sanders campaign to ensure that it has access for a march through the city and a convenient spot to host a rally and demonstration. But even then, he wasn't optimistic that the party was gearing up for a serene week. ""My guess is it won't be totally peaceful,"" Rendell said. ""But it will be more peaceful than [the Republican convention in] Cleveland. Total low bar, I know."" Sanders' close colleagues say he's fully aware of the delicate role he will play at the convention. ""He has clearly thought this thing through,"" said one lawmaker who has worked with him. And they insist that he is sincere in his desire to see Trump lose. That he has not stuck to a timeline that pleases all Clinton supporters is not an act of ego, they argue, but of legitimate policy pursuits and, in some ways, political finesse.""He can't just snap a finger and the people who have all the passion and support suddenly get up and have an epiphany and support Hillary Clinton,"" said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), one of the few members of Congress who endorsed Sanders. ""It is not going to work like that. Part of it will happen if Bernie walks us in that direction."" "
