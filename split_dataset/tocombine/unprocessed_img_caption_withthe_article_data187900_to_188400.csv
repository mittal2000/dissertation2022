However, not everyone was pleased with Phillips' win. After all, this is the fifth ""White Guy With a Guitar"" to win the reality talent competition, and some critics were tired of it. ""Those attractive, guitar-plucking fellas don't actually do that well once they've ventured out of 'Idol's' protective embrace and are expected to sell albums under their own steam -- and that's a problem for ""Idol"" as much as for the winners themselves,"" writes HuffPost TV's Laura Prudom. ""American Idol's"" predictable ""WGWG"" winner wasn't the only thing that got critics snarking. It turns out that ""Men in Black 3"" didn't bring back the nostalgia that writers longed for. TIME calls the film, ""so creaky and out of touch it inspires pity."" Meanwhile, one person (literally, only one) didn't quite like Wes Anderson's heavily-praised ""Moonrise Kingdom.""

Let us know which critical torpedoes landed on deserving targets and which fell wide of the mark in the comments. "
