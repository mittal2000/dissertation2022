While the Occupy movement, Bank Transfer Day and the fallout of Bank of America's $5 debit card fee have all heightened public skepticism of large financial institutions, big banks still control more than 12 times the assets of credit unions, according to the National Credit Union Administration's figures. And though credit unions provide cost-effective financial services and money management options, they might not be the most suitable choice for everyone.

Maybe, if you believe Italian magazine Grazia. In this week's issue, the Italian tabloid alleges that Brand sent his ex-wife an emotional email in the hopes of reconciling. According to the Daily Mail, Brand told Perry that divorcing after 14 months of marriage was a ""mistake.""So what triggered Brand's reported change of heart? Seeing photos of the 27-year-old popstar cozying up to ""Florence and the Machine"" gutarist Robert Ackroyd at last month's Coachella Music Festival, an unnamed source told the tabloid. Brand, 36, filed for divorce in December 2011, just 14 months after he wed the singer. Their split, which was finalized in February, was reportedly amicable -- Perry signed the divorce doc with a smiley face and Brand requested no money from his former wife, even though their lack of prenup entitled him to half of what Perry had earned during their marriage. Brand also reportedly gave Perry rights to the $6.5 million home they bought while married. If Brand and Perry were to get back together, they'd be in good company.
