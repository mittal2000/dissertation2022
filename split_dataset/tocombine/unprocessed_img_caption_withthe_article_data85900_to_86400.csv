The day is also considered to be sacred by many pagans and Wiccans around the world who celebrate the solstice among their other yearly holidays. Some refer to the summer solstice as ""Litha,"" a term that may derive from 8th century monk Bede's The Reckoning of Time. Bede names ""Litha"" as the Latin name for both June and July in ancient times. The summer solstice is one of four solar holidays, along with the autumnal equinox, the winter solstice and the vernal equinox. The other major pagan holidays are Samhain, Imbolc, Beltane and Lughnasadh. Observers celebrate the solstice in myriad ways, including festivals, parades, bonfires, feasts and more. As one member of the Amesbury and Stonehenge Druids explains, ""What you're celebrating on a mystical level is that you're looking at light at its strongest. It represents things like the triumph of the king, the power of light over darkness, and just life – life at its fullest."" Celebrations for the summer solstice take place around the world, and not all are pagan-affiliated. One of the biggest pagan celebrations occurs at Stonehenge in England, but others take place among indigenous Latin and South American communities, and in Russia, Spain and other countries. As the official first day of summer, the solstice is a time of celebration. Cities around the world will mark the day with spiritual and secular celebrations, like this yoga festival in New York's Times Square."

Medicaid is a government health insurance program for the poor.The Senate proposed a market-based plan for using federal money to underwrite private healthcare coverage. But the more conservative House balked at accepting anything derived from President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, a law Republicans strongly oppose.Without a budget for the fiscal year starting July 1, lawmakers reconvened on June 1 and worked out compromises to fund a ""low-income pool"" of local, state and federal money to reimburse hospitals for care of the uninsured poor.The Senate sought again to expand Medicaid eligibility, but the House held firm.Legislators gave Governor Rick Scott a $400 million package of tax cuts, which he signed this week. A breakthrough in prolonged budget negotiations came near midnight on Monday, with the sudden emergence of $300 million in a wide range of programs and building projects - dubbed ""turkeys"" in the legislative process - to smooth ruffled feathers.Democrats objected not only to rejection of federal Medicaid money, but also to what they called a short-changing of environmental protection spending.Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a state constitutional amendment last fall requiring one-third of state real estate development taxes to be spent on land acquisition and water protection, but Republican legislative leaders spread the money among a wide range of programs that they said met the conservation criteria.Scott, a conservative Republican, can use his line-item veto to cull parts of the budget before signing it next week.When the Legislature adjourned three days early in late April, unable to pass a budget, Scott had ordered state agencies to draw up contingency lists of essential functions like prison operations and child protective services that would have to be maintained if a budget were not passed by July 1 and state agencies were forced to shutter.(Editing by David Adams and Will Dunham)"

But many believe the escapees remain in the heavily wooded regions of New York's Adirondack Mountains and Vermont's Green Mountains.""A correction officer was placed on administrative leave this evening as part of the ongoing investigation into the escape at Clinton Correctional Facility,"" the New York state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said in a statement.It said no further details would immediately be released.Separately, Major Charles Guess of the New York State Police told reporters that investigators had spent ""countless hours"" interviewing another prison worker, Joyce Mitchell, who is accused of assisting in the breakout.Mitchell, 51, a training supervisor in the prison tailor shop who is charged with giving hacksaw blades to the convicted murderers, lost her nerve to drive their getaway car and instead checked into a hospital with a panic attack, authorities said.""(We) won't characterize if we have all information we need from Joyce Mitchell at this point,"" Guess said.The busted prison cell walls, steam pipe and manhole cover the convicts slipped through to escape have been repaired, allowing authorities to lift a lockdown at the maximum security prison, Daniel Martuscello, a deputy commissioner of state corrections, said at a news conference.Meanwhile, law enforcement officers, assisted by sniffer dogs, have so far searched 160 seasonal homes and unoccupied buildings and 585 miles (941 km) of trails and railroad beds.Experts say the escapees' range is limited by their survival skills.""They can disappear very easily but to survive is another story, and that's really predicated on their plan and their equipment and, of course, their abilities,"" said Pat Patten, who was hired to help with the 2003 capture of Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph after more than five years on the run in the Appalachian Mountains.Matt, 48, and Sweat, 35, broke out of prison at the height of the region's black fly season, when even the most hardened outdoorsmen douse themselves in insect repellent and wear head nets to guard against bug bites that can cause extreme irritation and sometimes even death.After being incarcerated for so long, Patten said, the men will not fare well in the woods and are likely relying on civilization, including abandoned seasonal homes and camps, to gather food and equipment needed to stay hidden.Patten said interactions with civilization are commonly where fugitives trip up.Matt has a history of escapes, including one in 1986 in which he broke out of New York's Erie County Correctional Facility, only to be caught five days later in a family apartment near Buffalo.Shane Hobel, founder of Mountain Scout Survival School in Beacon, New York, said the precision with which their escape was executed leads him to believe that Matt and Sweat had a destination in mind when they left the prison, and he doubts that plan included a lengthy stay in the wilderness.

3,QUEER VOICES,Russell Moore: The Religious Right Will Triumph Over Gay Marriage,Lila Shapiro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russell-moore-gay-marriage_n_7623824.html,,2015-06-20,"Rev. Russell Moore, director of the Southern Baptistâs Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, leads a discussion during the group's national conference Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2014, in Nashville, Tenn. Southern Baptists organized the three-day event to strengthen the resolve of Christians preaching the increasingly unpopular view that gay relationships are sinful. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafdda92100006401c70db2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Russell Moore still thinks the religious right will win the battle against same-sex marriage. Oh, not at the Supreme Court later this month -- like nearly everyone else, Moore is almost positive the right will lose there. But the long game... that, he says, could be a different story.Earlier this week, about 5,000 evangelicals gathered in Ohio for the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, where they adopted a resolution to resist the legalization of same-sex marriage, “no matter how the Supreme Court rules.” On Friday, Moore, the president of the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, spoke with The Huffington Post by phone about why the same-sex marriage battle isn’t over and why he thinks that religious conservatives' concerns could be at the forefront of the next presidential election. We’re on the verge of a major ruling from the Supreme Court that many anticipate will legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states. What are you predicting for this ruling?Well, I’ve been predicting for years that the court is hell-bent on imposing same-sex marriage on all 50 states. So that's what I’m expecting the court to do. I've been surprised before, and I hope I’m surprised again, but I doubt it.When did you first start predicting that?Well, I’ve been saying that for years to our people, just seeing the way that things were moving both judicially and culturally -- that same-sex marriage was coming to every part of the country. Because I didn’t want evangelicals caught flat-footed the way that evangelicals were by Roe v. Wade, not anticipating that any such thing could happen, and also because there are many evangelicals who wrongly believed that this was simply a blue-state phenomenon that they would remain isolated from in their communities. I wanted people to be ready and equipped. So I’ve been saying that for years -- especially, though, after [United States v. Windsor]. When that decision came down, my immediate reaction that I tweeted out was, this is the Roe v. Wade of marriage. Then I thought for a minute and decided, no, this is Griswold v. Connecticut. Just as Griswold set the framework, I think Windsor set the framework of a court wanting to move in the direction of same-sex marriage everywhere. During the Southern Baptist Convention this week, members adopted a resolution stating that “no matter how the Supreme Court rules, the Southern Baptist Convention reaffirms its unwavering commitment to its doctrinal and public beliefs concerning marriage."" Can you talk about what this means in practical terms?Well, if the court rules as I anticipate, evangelicals will still stand where we’ve always stood on marriage -- as a union of one man and one woman. We have no option to capitulate on that, because marriage in a Christian vision of reality isn’t just a social contract. Marriage points to something beyond the natural order -- the union of Christ and his church. We didn’t make up a Christian sexual ethic and we can’t undo a Christian sexual ethic.What it will mean is that we will have to articulate things that we previously could assume. For a long time, especially in the Bible Belt, pastors could assume that most people understood what we meant by marriage, so we could speak about healthy marriages in shorthand. Now we have to define what we believe about marriage, why we believe about marriage. That's not a new situation for Christians -- that's what's happening in the context of the New Testament, defining Christian marriage over and against a Greco-Roman sexual culture. But it's a new situation for American evangelicals.I think that the pro-life movement provides the model for the future. The pro-life movement is a long-term movement that is also multipronged, and that will be the case for the pro-marriage, pro-family movement as well -- to recognize that this isn’t simply about a presidential election or two. It's about working in the political arena, but also working in the cultural arena.I believe the sexual revolution can’t keep its promises. I’m preparing our churches to receive the refugees from the sexual revolution. For those who ask 'What is there other than this?' I said this week at the meeting, there are two kinds of people who won't be able to minister to those refugees. One is the kind of person who has been screaming in anger at those who disagree with us. The other kind is the person who has given up the Gospel and the biblical view about marriage. So we have to stand with conviction and with kindness at the same time.Over the past decade, public opinion has swung sharply on same-sex marriage. In Pew Research polling in 2001, for example, Americans opposed same-sex marriage by a 57 percent to 35 percent margin. Today, a majority of Americans -- 57 percent -- support same-sex marriage, compared with 39 percent who oppose it. Do you think that advocates who opposed same-sex marriage made tactical errors that led to this shift?Yes, I think that that's part of it. I think the largest part of it is an overwhelming movement in American culture of separating the individual from the larger community and of defining the individual in terms of the sum of his or her desires. I think that's the largest part of it. But I do think that there were errors made on our side. For one thing, I think that many pro-marriage people assumed that we would always represent a majority in American opinion, and so the argument was always made in majoritarian terms -- that the same-sex marriage movement only represented elite judges and blue states. For a while, that was true. But we needed to be prepared to argue for something that is right regardless of whether or not the majority of Americans agree with us. I think that was a key error. I think the other error was, there were some people speaking to this issue from my side who were angry and presented a public face of outrage in a way that I don’t think was helpful. Evangelicals don’t dislike our gay and lesbian neighbors, and we don’t mean them harm. We don’t think that what they want -- same-sex marriage -- is going to give them what they want. So we need to constantly balance conviction and kindness, truth and grace at the same time. And I think that evangelicals at the local church level are doing a much better job of this than most people know.I wonder if supporters of traditional marriage were too slow to tell the American people that they were not anti-gay. If, for example, those who opposed same-sex marriage had spent significant time early on in this debate clarifying the difference between opposition to changing the legal definition of marriage and a perceived hostility toward gay people, might the American public feel differently about these issues?I’m not sure. I think there are cultural factors unleashed in the 1960s that have been working their way out over the past 40 or 50 years in a way that I’m not sure what would have made things different. I think having an explanation of our theology from the very beginning, in rich, robust terms, would have been the right way to go. Many people are just ignorant of what Christians and Mormons and Orthodox Jews and Muslims believe about marriage. So for instance, when someone would say 'Well, Christians are just going to have to get over this' -- Christians can’t get over this. It was the same argument used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries about miracles. 'Well, in order to reach contemporary people, Christians will just have to get over virgin births and empty tombs.' But Christians can’t just get rid of the miraculous without getting rid of Christianity. And the same thing is true of sexual ethics.Two recent studies suggest that the influence of religious social conservatives is waning dramatically. Statistics from the Pew Research Center show both that the number of Americans who identify as Christian has dropped and that the number of people who are religiously unaffiliated has grown over the last five years. Meanwhile, the Public Religion Research Institute released a study showing that nearly one-third of millennials who left the faith they grew up with did so because of “negative teachings” or “negative treatment” related to gays and lesbians. Do you see any way to reverse these trends?Well, I don’t think that the trends are the way that they’re being reported. If one looks at the Pew study, for instance, what one finds is evangelicalism remaining remarkably steady in American life. What is disappearing is mainline Protestantism. If the key for growth for Christianity is to accommodate the sexual revolution, we would expect to see a booming Episcopal Church USA and a growing Universal Life Church. But that's not the case. The Presbyterian Church USA, which has adapted to the same-sex marriage revolution, is almost gone now. So I don’t think that's an accurate reading of the way that Christianity ought to go forward. Christianity thrives best when we’re distinct from the culture around us, not when we’re a mirror image of it.Do you think religious conservatives have lost the culture wars, at least on the issue of marriage?In the short term, yes. I think that's true. And that's why I say we need to take a long-term strategy, because I simply believe that this is not the endpoint of the conversation. As we see already, the conversation is going even beyond the definition of what is marriage, to the question of what is a man and what is a woman? And beyond that we’re beginning to see questions about dispensing with monogamy and so forth. So we have to be the people who are holding fast the way to the old paths on these things, because I really believe that this endless redefinition of marriage and sexuality will not be sustainable. So I’m a short-term pessimist and a long-term optimist. Would you say the religious faction of the Republican Party has lost some of its influence? Do people of faith have less political influence than they did 20 years ago? If so, to what would you attribute that?I don’t think that's the case, I just think it's different. I think we’re having a generational changing of the guard when it comes to religious conservatism right now that has a different tone, a different center of gravity. I think that's where things are. I don't think there’s any diminishing of religious conservatism, but I do think that some people in secular America still tend to be looking for the TV evangelists of the 1980s as their model of what religious conservatism looks like, and that's not the case.We want not just to talk about people who disagree with us, but to speak to people who disagree with us. I think that's what's changing. And there’s an entire army of new leaders, those of us who are coming onto the scene now, who hold to the old doctrines and the old convictions and also recognize that we have to explain those things in a new context.Do you think the partisan alignment of religious groups -- their affiliation with the Republican Party -- has narrowed its appeal?I think what some people assumed for a long time is that the religious conservatives, the younger generation of us, would become divided out between the Democrat and Republican Parties, and that didn’t happen. And the reason it didn’t happen is not because evangelicals are so attached to the Republican Party, but because the Democratic Party has become so hostile to religious conservatives of every kind. The younger evangelicals I know who voted for Obama in 2008 were very quickly disappointed and disillusioned, because they bought into the rhetoric he was using of, 'Well, let's work together to reduce abortions, we’re not red states and blue states, we’re the United States.' And then we have six years of the most aggressive abortion advocacy of any administration, and the most egregious religious liberty violations from any administration since the American Revolution. It's also the case, if one looks at the Republican field this year, that there really are no major candidates that are hostile to religious conservatives ideologically or in any other way, in a way that has not been true in the past. Jon Huntsman was pro-same-sex marriage in 2012. Rudy Giuliani supported abortion in 2008. So that's not the case this year, which is one of the reasons I know of religious conservatives supporting just about every candidate in the field -- with the exception of Donald Trump. I don’t know any evangelical who is supporting Donald Trump.It's early to tell, but do you think issues that are important to people of faith have received more or less attention than in previous elections?Well, it's so early, it's hard to tell. I just know in my conversations with presidential candidates, most of them really do understand the issues facing the country and what conservative evangelicals care about. I think one of the things I think is different is there's not one candidate this year who is anointed by the media as the evangelical candidate -- which means that the candidates are all speaking to and concerned about evangelical voters, or, almost all. Which I think is a good thing.This interview has been edited for length and clarity. "

If their fingers meet their innie or outtie, congratulations are--apparently--in order. They've got a rockin' bod. If not, unspoken shame seeps in: time to hit the gym and back off the bagels. In some ways, this reminds me of silly games my friends and I used to play during our childhood. For example, in the second grade, there was a test to see how long our hair would grow by the end of the school year. We'd tilt our heads back, waiting for a classmate to scurry behind us and point to where our existing hair now fell. This spot indicted where our tresses would land a few months later. Even during junior high, we'd invent games that were equally absurd. An evening at the bowling alley turned into a challenge designed to predict our future binkie and diaper purchases; any pins still standing upon the ball's release represented the amount of children we'd have as an adult. Clearly, all of this was purely nonsense for the sake of it, nothing more than enjoying some giggles and passing time. After all, I never did have hair that grazed the top of my buttocks during the third grade, and these days, I'm a 40-year-old woman who apparently must have scored a 300 every time. Fighting inner voices, temptationSo when I first saw teens and adults partaking in the belly button challenge, I--a person who came dangerously close to letting eating disordered behaviors destroy me a few years ago--rolled my eyes. It was just a fun thing, right? Try it. You know you want to.I fought the voice in my head when it came to this bizarre trend.I'd keep seeing mention of it on several sites though, one media outlet after another talking about the craze. Pictures of arms stretched around backs and over to belly buttons continue to flood the Internet. Yikes. Thankfully, there's been serious backlash about the craze. Experts have likened the act to the earlier, and just as popular--but equally ludicrous--thigh gap challenge. Others have also extended warnings about mental and physical health, saying that getting in on this trend is detrimental for body image and our physiology. On social media, efforts such as #BoobsOverBellyButtons strive to counter this challenge with a healthier, in-your-face attitude. Still: Try it. You know you want to.The more body-confident challenges seem wonderful in a world that tends to be more on board with jumping down the eating disordered rabbit hole. There, people are virtually applauded, a collection of hashtags rooting us on. Tipping my toe in the Belly Button Challenge waters...sort ofConfession time: I tried it. I tried it, though, for the right reason. Or what seemed like the right reason. See, I knew full well I wouldn't be able to reach my belly button, a far cry from the days when I easily would have been able to. That, my friends, was the victory right there. Not being able to introduce my innie to my pinkie reinforced my successful departure from daily perfection quests and food fears. However, my thrill in not meeting the goal in this challenge was quickly replaced with thoughts I recognized all too well. For the first time in a long while, I felt a pang of disappointment. I caught myself in the mirror striking a pose in which I was half-hugging myself, trying to embrace an ideal. I was astutely aware of the space between my fingers and my navel. I even took my other hand to ""measure"" the distance with my outstretched fingers, and then stared at it. My goodness, I'm a 40-year-old woman. I might as well tilt my head back and hit the bowling alley.Inches. I wasn't even close. Even though I'm eating regular meals and have put on weight since my ""no thanks, I'll pass on that extra carrot"" days, I have to admit that every so often, fleeting pangs of strange eating temptations set in. Yet I continue to enjoy healthy fats, carbs and even whole yogurts. I don't give in to strict, limiting behaviors. Instead, I sit satisfied that I didn't meet the goal of a viral body craze, while realizing that trying it in the first place means I still have some challenges of my own to overcome."

Williams would have desperately wanted to stay in the anchor chair, or at least keep some exalted position, while continuing on his $10 million a year salary. NBC was forced to negotiate because they didn't have the courage to simply do the right thing; fire Williams in the name of honesty and integrity.In exchange for money and silence from both sides, NBC gets to bury Williams on its cable news outlet where few people will see him.

My bet is that Frankenstein will escape from the laboratory.Network news has a long history of creating monsters, convincing them that they are the franchise, and losing control of them.

ABC News plans its election coverage around George Stephanopoulos, who was discovered to have donated $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation. An embarrassed George said he should have disclosed the gift, revealing that he is not at his core a journalist. As ABC's chief political reporter, he never should have given the gift to the foundation established by the most political couple in America, Bill and Hillary Clinton.They used to say in the news business, ""You can sleep with elephants if you want to, but if you do you can't cover the circus."" Now it seems you can sleep with anyone and do the walk of shame to work the next day. ABC News couldn't fire George, as they should have, or even remove him from political coverage. They can't. They don't have anyone else to do it.Honesty and integrity are all you have in the news business. If the public doesn't believe you, you're done. Millions of Americans already think reporters make stuff up and Brian Williams only confirmed their belief.I felt terrible for Williams when he was caught in the lies. To be such a public figure and become a national punch line would be devastating. He's probably spent a lot of time awake at 4 am. I lost respect for Brian Williams, but not because he lied. I lost it because he refused to honorably resign. And I lost respect for NBC News for not having the backbone to fire him."

The combined European exchanges, at 15 trillion dollars in valuation, and the combined value of the U.S. stock exchanges at 20 trillion, however, still, at least for now, exceed the capitalization of China's public equity market by a considerable margin.  Shanghai, Pudong SkylineNo doubt the ""loose"" monetary policies pursued by the major central banks has facilitated the rise in the value of China's stock markets. Since the introduction of ""quantitative easing"" by the U.S. Federal reserve Bank in 2008 and similar policies by other central banks, the value of the world's stock markets have doubled. China's markets have more than quadrupled. Collectively, the world's stock markets now represent about a quarter of the world's combined financial assets.In one sense the fact that China, the world's second largest economy, should also have the world's second highest valued equity market should not come as a big surprise. The two, while not inexorably linked, do tend to proceed in tandem. The rise in China's economic power, which the rise in its stock markets underscore, however, has also fuelled a concomitant rise in China's international military and political ambitions. Those ambitions and their consequences were driven home last week by a number of other events.On June 6, Hungary became the first European nation to formally sign a cooperation agreement for China's new ""Silk Road"" initiative to develop trade and transport infrastructure across Asia. The historic ""silk road"" was a system of overland caravan routes across central Asia that linked China, via the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, with the Middle East, Russia and Europe. The trade route flourished in particular during the 13th and 14th century as a result of the Mongol conquest of much of Central Asia and China and resulted in the first significant and sustained contact between Medieval Europe and China. This new initiative, first unveiled in 2014, represents a far more ambitious undertaking and consists of a number of far ranging infrastructure projects including a network of railways, highways, oil and gas pipelines, power grids, Internet networks, maritime and other infrastructure links across Central, West and South Asia extending from the coastal cities of the South and East China Seas as far as Greece, Russia and Oman, Chinese Russian Summit, March 2015This multi-trillion dollar investment program would represent an unprecedented expansion of Chinese political and economic influence across Central Asia resulting in trillions of dollars in trade and facilitate the expansion of Chinese exports to Europe. It would allow China to further cement its economic and trade relationships in the oil and mineral rich countries of Central Asia. Many of these nations, former Soviet Republics, are also being heavily wooed by Moscow to become part of Russia's Eurasian Economic Union. In the meantime along the South China Sea littoral, two other developments underscore the far reaching ripples of China's ambitions. In recent months, Beijing has undertaken a massive land reclamation project designed to increase the surface area of a number of contested shoals in the South China Sea and allow the construction of air fields and permanent military facilities. The shoals are part of two island groups, the Paracel and the Spratly Islands. Control of these islands has been disputed by the nations surrounding the South China Sea since at least the 3rd century BC. At stake, are fishing rights and the potential for vast untapped hydrocarbon reserves below the seafloor. The region also contains key maritime transit routes that are vital to the countries that border the South China Sea or its peripheral areas.  Competing Territorial Claims in the South China SeaIronically, the practice of building up the shoals to allow permanent facilities was a practice that began with the Philippine and Vietnamese governments. China was late to the party but is now making up for its tardiness with an unprecedented program of land reclamation. Should Beijing succeed in enforcing its claims, the South China Sea would become a virtual Chinese lake and allow China to project military force from a string of newly created islands along its periphery. China's ambitions to control the South China Sea and its potential resources has raised concerns among the other countries that border the region. Two events in recent weeks, marking unprecedented cooperation among former enemies, underscore the gravity of those concerns.On June 5, Japanese and Philippine media disclosed that from June 22 through the 26th Japan and the Philippines planned to hold a joint maritime drill in the South China Sea. This was the second such drill in as many months although Philippine government sources described this drill as the first ""official"" joint exercise between the two countries since the end of the Second World War.  Japanese and Philippine Naval Forces Conduct Joint Drills in the South China Sea, May 2015More significantly, in addition to pledging to strengthening security cooperation between the two countries and to concluding an agreement for the transfer of ""defense equipment and technology and expanding bilateral and multilateral trainings and exercises"", the two countries also agreed to open discussions on a visiting forces agreement that would allow Tokyo access to Philippine military bases. This is the first time that Japanese forces would have ongoing access to Philippine military facilities since the end of WW II. While the agreement stops short of a permanent Japanese military presence in the Philippines it does allow for a continuous rotation of Japanese Military Self Defense Forces (JMSDF) that would result in much the same thing. The presence of Japanese military forces on the Philippines is not without some controversy. Eighty years of Philippine-Japanese cooperation have not entirely healed the scars of Japan's brutal occupation of the Philippines during the Second World War. In the meantime, on the opposite end of the South China Sea, two other historic enemies, Vietnam and the United States, announced that in July, Nguyen Phu Trong, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam was expected to visit the United States.  Chinese Island Building in the South China SeaThe visit caps a process of reconciliation between the two former combatants that began in 1995 when Washington finally opened diplomatic relations with Hanoi and which has seen the execution of a broad range of agreements between the two countries including, significantly, in 2014, the lifting of the U.S. embargo against supplying military hardware to Vietnam. More significantly, Vietnam's growing cooperation with the United States heralds a profound realignment of Hanoi's foreign policy from an ""unofficial"" strategic partnership with China to a defacto strategic alignment with the United States. The fact that Hanoi is prepared to undertake such a realignment, notwithstanding its still broad ideological differences with Washington, underscores how significantly its attitude towards its former ""strategic protector"" and ""big brother has changed. Three events, none of which elicited more than a ripple of interest in the western media and which individually are unlikely to merit much more than a footnote in the broad sweep of China's history. Collectively however, they underscore the profound, far reaching changes that are realigning the political and strategic landscape of East Asia."

To most people, I was yet another Latin-American backpacker on a walkabout, or maybe a seminarian or devotee of Francis. They thought I was there for the interior life. Yet I was neither ""finding myself"" nor on a pilgrimage. I had gone to Europe during a seasonal furlough without a plan and hardly any money, just to see art and architecture, and maybe do a little hiking. Sadly a few months before my visit, an earthquake had nearly destroyed the Cathedral of St. Francis, pulverizing portions of some famous Giotto frescoes that I wanted to see. The cathedral was mostly closed and would take years of restoration. You could still visit the crypt, and I almost skipped it, having by then seen enough of overwrought, gilded saints' coffins for a lifetime. But I had gown up admiring Francis. He was all about Mother Earth, Brother Sun, herbs and animals. I had already begun my career in the outdoors, so I went downstairs to pay due respect to the Patron Saint of Ecology. The crypt room was quiet, cool and smelled like damp earth and beeswax. There was nothing frilly about the undecorated stonework, except on the hats of some old women, who were kneeling on the floor and whispering rosaries. It felt more like a grotto than the basement of a cathedral, and unlike any church I had visited in Europe, the place felt sacred. I was so surprised I lit a candle. I knelt among the grandmas...I'm thinking about that journey, as I watch twitter flurry with thousands of comments about Laudato Si', the encyclical on environment by Pope Francis, whose namesake is St. Francis of Assisi. ""Game changer,"" is a term commonly used to describe the long-anticipated letter. I never imagined seeing the Sierra Club praise the Bishop of Rome, this first Latin-American Pope in History.

St. Francis has been a key figure in Latin-American cultures for centuries. His message runs counter to the history of agricultural, industrial and urban overdevelopment of the Americas and the resulting decay of our natural environment - our home. For many Catholic Latinos, in the prayers of St. Francis, such as the Canticle of Creatures we see our own culturally ingrained devotion to the natural world around us.

The original cells are far different. When I reached few of the stone structures along a natural wall, they seemed more like the most humble ancestral Pueblo dwellings in the southwestern U.S. than anything I would imagine in Europe.

In 1970, the average age of a first-time mother, according to the CDC, was 21.4 years; today it's closer to 30.Having a kid is also more commonly understood to be a true marker of adulthood, more so than getting married or getting your first job.At the same time, having kids is becoming crazily expensive. According to the Wall Street Journal, the median cost to raise a kid (even excluding the cost of education, supplementary academic enrichment programs or indulgences like swim lessons) is $389,670.$389,670.AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.[Takes pill. Swallows.]This helps explain why dual income households represent 60% of families today. Unless you're yeoman farmers from times of yore, these kids ain't going to pay for themselves.Consequently, in Western countries, the cultural idea that it's a man's responsibility to earn and the woman's responsibility to stay-at-home has become outmoded: 75% of US and UK men believe men and women no longer have to conform to traditional gender stereotypes, 44% of new moms work full time, up from 33% in 2009 and 52% of men in the U.S. claim that they're the primary grocery shopper (granted that's self-reported but still a marked departure from previous claims that Moms are the de facto CEOs of the household).In fact, men are more comfortable with fluid domestic dynamics. Only 52% of men  say if money were no object, they would prefer to work full-time v. staying at home with their kids. Additionally, 2M men now register as full-time stay-at-home dads, per the last Census, which is double what it was 20 years ago. A UCLA study also recently demonstrated that couples that divide chores most effectively had the highest reported levels of marital satisfaction, had more sex and stayed together longer.Based on the conclusions of the monumental, 75-year Grant Study, the first, longitudinal study of happiness in which 268 college students were monitored over the course of their entire lives, we know that the warmth of your relationship with your parents is one of the main determinants of emotional stability and financial success later in life. The study similarly revealed that among the participants, having kids yielded greater and more profound happiness.So what does this all mean? Having kids later means men have a more fully formed sense of identity so being a parent isn't the primary thing that defines them (even if spending time with kids is the thing they say they most look forward to throughout the day). This is also a group that has become reliant on technology and digital media for solving all of their lifestyle inconveniences, and what bigger disruption to your life than having a kid?But who's talking to this audience? These guys aren't seeking books for answers to questions that come up in real-time. Additionally, the information that's currently available online is either wildly disaggregated or geared explicitly or implicitly towards the fairer sex. Per a recent BabyCenter study, 58% of men say there is not enough or barely enough dad-focused content online, and 69% say they wish there was more parenting content available.What do these guys care about: For one, how to harness technology for good without turning their kids into pale-faced shut-ins or giving them too much exposure too early to all of the weird corners of the Internet. Another is making sure that their kids will be competitive in a global marketplace without robbing them of a carefree childhood that promotes learning and discovery.Living lives increasingly defined by choice, these guys are not looking for a single authority to tell them what to do but are rather seeking an opportunity to harness the wisdom of friends and thought-leaders without being constrained by social mores.They're much more willing to share insights with other guys in a safe space, over Fantasy League listservs, in Google Groups and now even at Conferences.So into this mix comes Fatherly, a digital lifestyle guide for men entering parenthood. It delivers expert-driven, evidenced-based parenting insights, product and service recommendations tailored to the age of the user's child/ren. From a master architect explaining how to build a pillow fort in your living room to relationship advice from a world-renowned relationship therapist, or even Malala and her dad talking about how to raise a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Fatherly aims to be a resource for this next generation of millennial parents.Why do I care? In addition to my work with Fatherly, I've mentored at-risk kids via Big Brothers for a dozen years as well as adults more recently as the Co-Chair of the Board at Career Gear (a kind of ""Dress for Success"" for men), where grown men try to rise above poverty and re-connect with their families. Helping dudes make the most out of life has become my life's work and what better mission than helping to make the lives of the next generation of little humans (and their handlers) just a little bit easier?"

Only 52% of men  say if money were no object, they would prefer to work full-time v. staying at home with their kids.

13,BLACK VOICES,Charleston Shooting Judge Previously Used Racial Epithet In Court,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-gosnell-racist-word_n_7628398.html,,2015-06-20,"NORTH CHARLESTON, SC - JUNE 19: Judge James Gosnell speaks as Dylann Roof appears via video uplink from the detention center to the courtroom at Centralized Bond Hearing Court June 19, 2015 in North Charleston, South Carolina. Roof is charged with nine counts of murder and firearms charges in the shooting deaths at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina on June 17. (Photo by Grace Beahm-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0e14240000300096534e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The judge presiding over Friday's appearance by the 21-year-old accused of a racially motivated mass shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina, church had previously been reprimanded for using a racial epithet in court.Charleston County Magistrate James Gosnell was publicly reprimanded by a South Carolina disciplinary body in 2005 for uttering a derogatory word for an African-American to a defendant at a bond hearing. The same reprimand noted that Gosnell later bent the rules to get another judge out of jail who'd been caught driving under the influence with an open container in his car.In 2003, according to records on the South Carolina Judicial Department website, Gosnell spoke to a black defendant appearing before him whom he knew personally.""There are four kinds of people in this world: black people, white people, red necks and n****rs,"" Gosnell said to the man, according to the file. The judge later claimed that the crude observation was told to him by a black sheriff's deputy.Details of Gosnell's transgressions resurfaced Saturday on CNN.On Friday, Gosnell allowed family members of the nine victims killed at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church to address Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old charged with the mass shooting. That drew attention back to his rebuke for racist language. The judge had agreed with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel that he violated several parts of the official Code of Judicial Conduct, including that judges ""shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest bias or prejudice, including but not limited to bias or prejudice based upon race.""Gosnell's intervention on behalf of Charleston Municipal Court Judge Joseph Mendelsohn, who was arrested for drunk driving, came two days after the vulgar language in court. According to the reprimand, he sprung Mendelsohn from jail in the middle of the night although the procedure called for holding him until a normal bond hearing convened the next morning. Mendelsohn had been arrested in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, which has different rules from the county court, where Gosnell has authority. Gosnell met Mendelsohn and a Mount Pleasant lieutenant at the jail in an atypical arrangement that sprung the judge. Gosnell took the ticket issued to Mendelsohn, stamped ""bond hearing"" on the back and entered $1,000 -- the usual amount for a DUI bond -- on the form. (It is unclear from the record if money changed hands.) Gosnell stepped over other rules that would have required all inmates awaiting bond hearings to get an impromptu appearance like Mendelsohn. After handling Mendelsohn's case at 2:30 a.m, he finished by saying ""this didn’t happen until 8:00 a.m.,"" the time such hearings are scheduled to begin.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article cited an erroneous NBC report that Gosnell had been reassigned and removed from the case against Roof. He was not removed because, as a magistrate, he only presided over the bond hearing. Circuit Court Judge J.C. Nicholson will preside over the criminal proceeding."

Carefully.Branden Jacobs-Jenkins is the playwright, and Gloria -- at the Vineyard -- is the play. This verdict might not come as a surprise to playgoers who saw An Octoroon, with which Jacobs-Jenkins raised eyebrows in April 2014 at the Soho Rep (and in its transfer last February at Theater for a New Audience in Brooklyn). Which is not to say that the new play occupies the same terrain -- philosophically, thematically or stylistically -- as An Octoroon. Gloria is very much a spitfire office comedy, with a disparate group of insightfully-drawn characters providing wildly funny humor. Until...The author, it seems, has other things in mind. He rivets us to attention at the end of the first act in a manner that leaves you catching your breath and saying, well! But where, you ponder during intermission, can he possibly go from there? Jacobs-Jenkins changes course and enhances his theme in the first scene of the second act, and then shifts again for his compelling ending. The whole thing works out magnificently, in my view.

Individual praise is withheld, the better to avoid spoiling what the author is up to. But they are good. The staging by Evan Cabnet (of A Kid Like Jake and The Dream of the Burning Boy) is impeccable; there is a lot going on, here, and Cabnet firmly guides the players and the audience. There is also a keenly helpful set from Takeshi Kata, along with intelligent sound design from Matt Tierney (of Machinal). But the play's the thing, especially in this case. Jacobs-Jenkins has come up with a provocative theme, filled it with dazzling language, and managed to build it into something likely to resonate in your mind long after you climb the stairs of the Vineyard and spill out into the relatively placid Union Square.

On Friday in Times Square, the U.S. Department of Interior crushed one ton of ivory -- sending a clear message to traffickers of illegal ivory that the United States is committed to do its part to stop the slaughter of elephants across Africa. The trade responsible for the death of some 35,000 elephants annually (96 per day, or one every 15 minutes) also sows insecurity in countless communities impacted by the illegal ivory trade.

The Times Square ivory crush, representing the tusks of an estimated 60 poached elephants, came just two weeks after the May 29 destruction of a roughly equal amount of ivory in China, whose market is the largest in the world. On the day of their crush, China authorities signaled their intention to stop the processing and domestic sale of ivory.China noted that there are many other nations whose ivory markets fuel the elephant poaching crisis, calling on them to crack down further on their own domestic trade. With one of the largest markets outside of China, the United States must put an end to its domestic ivory market if it wishes to show leadership on this vital issue.

Last summer, New York and New Jersey enacted bans on the sale of ivory within their states. And the Obama Administration has created a Presidential Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking, allocating additional funding to the effort while tasking agencies across the government to take actions to end this crisis.At the same time, close to a dozen nations have burned or crushed seized ivory stockpiles in the last three years, including Chad, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, and the Republic of Congo in Africa, along with Belgium, China, Hong Kong SAR, France, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates. The world is truly uniting behind elephants. It is about time. WCS Vice President for Field Conservation Programs Joe Walston loads a piece of carved ivory on a conveyor belt to be crushed in Times Square on Friday, June 19. Photo by Julie Larsen Maher ©WCS.Much of the commentary around these destructions has been favorable, but some people have suggested that ridding ourselves of ivory might be harmful for elephant conservation by reducing the supply and thus stimulating prices (a key driver of elephant poaching).A recent misleading headline commenting on Malawi's destruction of ivory stockpiles (since postponed) read: ""One of the Poorest Countries in the World Is About to Burn $7.6M Worth of Ivory."" This misunderstanding is widespread, with some commentators erroneously suggesting that countries are foolish to burn such valuable national assets. Such criticism ignores two facts about confiscated ivory.First, because it is prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to sell seized ivory, it should not be compared to other confiscated consumer goods or to legal ivory from legitimate channels. Second, in assigning commercial value to poached and trafficked ivory, we may forget to calculate the social and ecological worth of living elephants for Africa. Approximately 35,000 elephants have been killed in Africa annually in recent years to feed the global demand for ivory. That is 96 elephants a day, or one every 15 minutes. Photo by Julie Larsen Maher ©WCS.The primary benefit in eliminating confiscated ivory is to prevent this material from re-entering the illegal trade and further stimulating trafficking, which has been a significant problem across Africa and Asia. If not destroyed, stockpiles must be secured in perpetuity. This is very expensive, logistically challenging, and often dangerous to those guarding them.Destroying this ivory sends a strong signal that governments will not tolerate trafficking and associated poaching. The awareness-raising value of stockpile destructions can be even more effective if the government destroying the ivory uses the occasion to announce new effective trafficking deterrents, including actions to fully prosecute criminals (particularly kingpins and major traffickers), significant fines, long jail sentences, and asset seizures.Closing ivory markets can address a significant threat to elephants and help African countries focus more on their in-site conservation. In the meantime, China's rich national carving heritage can continue using other substitute materials that do not support the trade in elephant ivory. Through a series of social media mini-campaigns developed in China, more than 8,000 Chinese have taken pictures documenting their pledge to ""Bring No Ivory Home"" on shouhudaxiang.org. Graphic ©WCS China Program.Consumers in the U.S., China, and other nations should join hands on this issue. As the Chinese government encourages greater ecological awareness among its citizens, the United States must itself do a better job in helping people see the connection between ivory sales and the slaughter of elephants. Supply side measures are essential but insufficient; elephants will never be safe until ivory is no longer perceived as prestigious or desirable.It is my great hope that yesterday's Times Square crush helps to elevate this issue for U.S. consumers, whose support and cooperation will be essential if we are to keep one of the world's great iconic species from going extinct in large parts of its range in our lifetime.-- Cristián Samper is president and CEO of WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) and a member of the U.S. Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking.

Through a series of social media mini-campaigns developed in China, more than 8,000 Chinese have taken pictures documenting their pledge to ""Bring No Ivory Home"" on shouhudaxiang.org. Graphic ©WCS China Program.Consumers in the U.S., China, and other nations should join hands on this issue. As the Chinese government encourages greater ecological awareness among its citizens, the United States must itself do a better job in helping people see the connection between ivory sales and the slaughter of elephants. Supply side measures are essential but insufficient; elephants will never be safe until ivory is no longer perceived as prestigious or desirable.It is my great hope that yesterday's Times Square crush helps to elevate this issue for U.S. consumers, whose support and cooperation will be essential if we are to keep one of the world's great iconic species from going extinct in large parts of its range in our lifetime.-- Cristián Samper is president and CEO of WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) and a member of the U.S. Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking.

Russia is willing to consider giving financial aid to Greece, a Russian government official said Friday ahead of talks between the leaders of the two countries. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc150a6230000370093e85a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Lefteris PapadimasATHENS, June 20 (Reuters) - Greece's left-wing government promised on Saturday to offer concessions to creditors to unlock billions of euros in funds and stave off default but kept a defiant anti-austerity tone ahead of a vital summit of euro zone leaders next week.With its banks hanging on life support from the European Central Bank, and billions of euros being withdrawn daily, Greece may have to impose capital controls within days unless a breakthrough is made at Monday's summit.While Greece has resisted demands for pension cuts and some tax rises, its leaders continue to say a deal is possible to release 7.2 billion euros in bailout funds from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.However, Europe's leaders have begun to lose patience after months of fruitless wrangling over what budget cuts and reforms Athens is prepared to deliver in exchange.In a column for Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis promised that Greece was prepared to move, although he gave no details.""Our side will arrive in Brussels with the determination to compromise further as long as we are not asked to do what previous governments did: to accept new loan tranches under conditions that offer little hope that Greece can repay its debts.""He said German Chancellor Angela Merkel faced a ""stark choice"" over whether to accept an agreement, adding: ""The choice, I am very much afraid, is hers.""Tsipras met his negotiating team in Athens and was expected to speak to European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker by phone to try to break the deadlock before the emergency summit, an EU official said.  DEFAULT LOOMSA full meeting of the cabinet was to be held at 11 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Sunday to discuss the proposals.European ministers have played down the prospect of a final agreement on Monday but hope that a political understanding can be reached in time for a full deal to be agreed by the end of the month.Greece needs money to avoid defaulting on a 1.6 billion euro IMF loan on June 30, a step that would endanger ECB support and Greece's continued membership of the euro.Austrian central bank governor Ewald Nowotny, a member of the ECB governing council, told the daily Der Kurier that if Greece defaulted, it would be ""technically bankrupt.""""In terms of economics and politics, it means chaos. There would be no alternative to exiting the euro and returning to the drachma.""The ECB on Friday raised the ceiling on the ""emergency liquidity assistance"" that Greece's banks rely on to keep their doors open.Underlining international concern that a Greek default could ripple across the world economy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said it was up to Greece to make concessions.""What we know is the best solution is for Greece to make some tough decisions and for this to be worked out,"" he told CNN television.However it remains unclear how far Tsipras, whose leftist Syriza government came to power in January vowing to lift Greece out of austerity, is willing to bend.Greek ministers maintained a defiant tone on Saturday, vowing to resist ""blackmail"" from creditors.""They want the Syriza government to become a footnote after it is defeated, after it bows its head. The mandate we have is to not do them this favor,"" Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis told Sunday's newspaper Realnews.  ECONOMIC DEVASTATIONUnder the austerity measures imposed by the IMF, the European Union and the ECB in two bailouts, economic output has fallen 25 percent, wages and pensions have been slashed, and one in four Greeks is jobless.But after months of fractious negotiations, some European leaders are now openly contemplating the possibility of Greece becoming the first nation to be dumped out of the euro zone.In an article in the Irish Times, Varoufakis criticized the behavior of his peers at a meeting of European finance ministers on Thursday.""An impartial spectator of our eurogroup deliberations would come to the safe conclusion that it is a strange forum, one ill-equipped to forge good, hard decisions when Europe truly needs them,"" he wrote.However, while some members of Syriza are not averse to quitting the euro, opinion polls suggest the majority of Greeks want to remain in the currency bloc they joined in 2001.A poll published in Sunday's Avgi, a pro-Syriza newspaper, indicated that 62 percent believed they would be worse off if Greece returned to the drachma, while 22 percent felt they would be better off.To that end, another rally is planned for the capital on Monday calling for Greece to stay in the euro.Greek businesses have also called on Tsipras to solve the crisis. Andreas Andreadis, head of the Greek tourism association SETE, told the German magazine Boerse Online that a ""Grexit"" would push Greece ""back to the level of a developing country.""

The 21-year-old accused of killing nine people inside a black church in Charleston made his first court appearance, with the relatives of all the victims making tearful statements. (Centralized Bond Hearing Court via AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2bf932200003000da7189.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A website surfaced on Saturday containing a possible trove of photos of Dylann Roof and a racist manifesto explaining why he allegedly targeted Charleston, South Carolina, in a shooting this week that killed nine African-Americans.The website, ""The Last Rhodesian,"" includes a passage about why the writer, identified as Roof, chose Charleston.I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.The Washington Post reported that law enforcement confirmed the website belonged to Roof, though it's unclear if Roof wrote the manifesto himself.The writer said that the Trayvon Martin shooting was a turning point in his life and led him to research ""black on White crime.""Gawker credited Twitter users @HenryKrinkle and @EMQuangel with uncovering the site. The Huffington Post has not yet confirmed the authenticity of the website.Roof is facing charges for opening fire inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic black house of worship, during a prayer meeting held Wednesday.People who knew Roof said they noticed troubling behavior shortly before the shooting. A black neighbor said Roof recently told him that he wanted to attack a college campus. Another friend told the New York Daily News that he took away Roof’s gun after he unleashed a bigoted rant two weeks before the shooting. In another section of the website -- which was created on Feb. 9, according to metadata -- are dozens of photos that appear to be of Roof. In some he's waving a Confederate flag or posing with a handgun. The photos appear to have been taken at a slave plantation, Sullivan Island, South Carolina, and the Museum and Library of Confederate History, according to The New York Times.Digital time stamp data on the photos show that six were modified on the day of the shooting.The website’s name refers to Rhodesia, a black-majority country in southern Africa ruled by a repressive white regime before being reconstituted as Zimbabwe. Roof wore a jacket with the flags of Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa in a Facebook photo. The website's landing page includes an image from the film ""Romper Stomper"" that shows Russell Crowe, who plays a neo-Nazi, lying in a pool of blood. The manifesto's full text is below:I was not raised in a racist home or environment. Living in the South, almost every White person has a small amount of racial awareness, simply beause of the numbers of negroes in this part of the country. But it is a superficial awareness. Growing up, in school, the White and black kids would make racial jokes toward each other, but all they were were jokes. Me and White friends would sometimes would watch things that would make us think that “blacks were the real racists” and other elementary thoughts like this, but there was no real understanding behind it.

""As one of only five states without hate crime laws, South Carolina cannot do what justice requires.

A porch. A pool. A car.-Aura BogadoThe Doors of the Church are Open""A church."" The question running through the minds of many African Americans, particularly black church folks is where and when will we ever be safe? Earlier this week nine prayer warriors were massacred at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. I'm immediately reminded of images of the shell of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham after it was bombed in 1963, killing four little girls preparing for a Sunday School program. Not safe, even in the Church.On Wednesday night, members of Emanuel gathered with their pastor in what should have been a safe place armed with nothing but their bibles. Seated in their midst was a young white man who was a stranger, yet welcomed as a friend. The black church embraces all. We accord a certain degree of respect and special recognition to those who do not look like us. The young man was seated next to the pastor, where he returned the church's hospitality with unimaginable inhumanity.Emanuel is a national treasure. Yolanda Pierce, professor of African American religion and literature at Princeton Theological Seminary, reminds us that ""the AME denomination was founded as a protest against racism"" and ""the black church was birthed as a sanctuary from white violence."" This is true of Emanuel AME, affectionately known as ""Mother"" Emanuel. Its storied history dates back almost 200 years. Mother Emanuel endured despite being burned down, outlawed and destroyed by an earthquake. Emanuel AME has been the target of racist attacks, legal harassment and arson. Each instance from 1818 - 2015 a person drunk on the wine of confederate supremacy stormed the doors of the church, set on eliminating sanctuary committed to teaching the south ""a more excellent way"" called love. Emanuel at every turn has responded with love rooted in justice by teaching literacy, producing leaders, protesting unequal treatment, fighting for economic parity and demanding the confederate flag be replaced by a symbol for all South Carolinians. Mother Emanuel exemplifies the best of our religious tradition--liberation, love and reconciliation.This storm too shall pass.Despite this breach, the black church will continue to serve as a sanctuary against racism and hatred. Across the country many of us sought comfort and solace in the very temples the gunman's hate attempted to destroy. We are encouraged by the images of South Carolinians of all races coming together to mourn and remember the fallen. Yet as we await justice, we must commit ourselves to dismantling the symbols that fuel such hatred, beginning with the Confederate battle flag. When other flags were lowered to half-mast in honor of the victims, that flag was not. It reminds us of its persistence as a symbol of insolence. It is structurally impossible to lower it over the State Capitol; however, it is possible to remove it by either executive or legislative order. It must come down.The Confederate battle flag has been a symbol of race hatred ever since its inception, and in the wake of this tragedy it becomes increasingly identified as a symbol of domestic terrorism for those who would like to ""take back our country"" to our most turbulent apartheid past. If South Carolina truly intends to honor the victims of the Mother Emanuel massacre, it can no longer associate with the image of this blood stained banner. The country's inability to connect a moral conversation to the dialogue about gun violence, mental health and racism is the subtext of this tragedy. Constitutional liberty must never overshadow the dialogue for public safety. The gunman's mental state is of concern for us all along with our refusal as a country to speak about the moral imperatives of gun safety and mental illness as a public health issue. We cannot definitively say access to ""smart gun technology"" would have prevented this tragedy or increased support for mental health programs might have helped this disturbed young man. We can say such support can stop future tragedies and provide a safer space for all to worship and dare us as a nation to create the space for a yet to be United States of America.When we see the faces of those who were lost and learn of their lives, we are devastated not just by the senselessness of the act but also because we know these victims. We know them--the civil servants, the recent graduate, the librarian, the track coach, the grandfather and the great-grandmother. They are representative of the members of almost any black church, assembled under the leadership of a civic-minded young pastor. They were hunted down by a young person infected with racialized hatred and mental instability who had access to weapons designed for sport. He has terrorized all of us.His actions will not terrify us from remaining true to the history and mission of the black church. In honor of those nine souls and of the countless others who preceded them, we will continue to exist, to protest, to remain open, to stand, and to pray. The doors of the church are open."

As a little boy, he always wanted to be a girl. He wanted to wear girls' clothes and have long hair that could be styled in curls and pinned back with pink plastic barrettes. He wanted to roll strawberry lip gloss onto his lips. He wanted to be pretty. My husband mustered up the courage to share this innermost part of himself with me back in 1984, one year after we got married. As a young bride, I was confused and did not understand what was wrong with him. I was angry and hurt that he would have such desires. I hoped he wasn't a sexual deviant. I wondered why being married to me and starting a new life wasn't enough for him. I simply did not know about a condition known as gender dysphoria. My husband was at odds with his birth gender. At the time, we had no resources. There was no Internet to turn to. His secret had become ours, and we continued wrestling with his unexplained desire to dress as a woman, a need so great it was unstoppable. Our marriage became one that had two stories. One story was the story of success shown to the outside world -- the story that unfolds with two beautiful sons, accomplished careers, vacations, cars and the house on the hill. And then there is the other story, a private tale of confusion, hurt feelings and resentment. There are chapters of our marriage when my husband's desire to cross-dress was too great not to act out on, followed by dark periods of depression for having to live a life that felt wrong; times when I was threatened as a wife by the woman inside of my husband; moments when I was angry at this inner woman who dwelled within him, and lashed out at him because I didn't know how to get to her. We had a story that was kept private, unable to share with the outside world. After 25 years of marriage, our two stories had become blurry and it had become emotionally draining to keep the narratives defined. Our worlds were changing, and more information regarding gender dysphoria and transgender individuals had become available. I was able to understand better that there was nothing wrong with me, or with us. The only thing wrong was that my husband strongly felt he was a woman, and that fact was slowly destroying his spirit. The need to be a woman had become too great. Together, we decided to rewrite our marriage and to live one true story. We agreed that my husband would transition fully into a woman. In the last three years, the husband that I married revolved into a woman with the use of hormones and surgery. It has been a whirlwind of couples therapy, legal papers and name changes. There have been many conversations with friends, coworkers and family members, both positive and negative. It has been a time of many changes. My life as the wife of a transgender person is a roller coaster. There are many ups and downs, yet not once have I felt like I want to get off this ride. I am still in love with the person I married back in 1984. A person who today is a she. She has transitioned successfully into a woman both physically and emotionally. Most importantly, she is who she is today, and because of that, I have witnessed true joy in the person I've grown a life with -- a person whose blue eyes shine because she feels right in her own skin. Our story is still being written, and is far from over. This essay is just a blurb to the deeper story. There are more words to come. Words of how I feel as the wife. Words of love and acceptance as well as words of complicated grief while I stood by the person I married and wanted more than anything to have this story finish with a happy ending. Words I will write that will continue to tell our story, our one true story, for the world to see."

They defy political stereotypes. But the ideal Democratic candidate is a tough liberal. And the ideal Republican candidate is a nice conservative. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush are aiming to meet those standards.The stereotype of a liberal is weak and indecisive. George McGovern was ""a thousand percent'' behind his running-mate until he dropped him from the ticket. Walter Mondale got pushed around by the special interests. Michael Dukakis rode in a tank. Barack Obama meets with defiance from his own party.We used to have plenty of tough liberals. Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur for insubordination. John Kennedy stood up to the Soviets in the Cuban missile crisis. Defy LBJ, and you'd probably wake up in the morning missing an important body part. Hillary Clinton aims to revive the tough liberal image. She describes herself as a ""fighter,'' just as she did when she first ran for President in 2008. ""If you know one thing, when I say I will fight for you, I will,'' she said in Ohio that year. Clinton mocked Obama, telling voters in Rhode Island, ""Now I can stand here and say, 'Let's just get everybody together. Let's get unified. The sky will open. The light will come down. Celestial choirs will be singing. And everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect.''' She added, ""Maybe I have just lived a little too long, but I have no illusions about how hard this is going to be.'' She won't mock Obama in 2016. But the contrast will be implicit. A Clinton supporter in Iowa put it this way: ""Obama's quiet, a studious person, a wonk, a constitutional lawyer. Hillary is more of an activist. And you need an activist when you have a Congress that puts obstacles in your way. An activist doesn't stop trying.''Clinton's campaign video is labeled ""Fighter.'' It opens with her saying, ""What is a fighter? To me, a fighter is someone who won't give up.'' Clinton proved it in 2008 by staying in the race until the very end. She risked being criticized for stubbornness. Instead, she won admiration for fortitude.The stereotype of a conservative is mean and nasty. Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich, Dick Cheney and Ted Cruz are not known for their generosity of spirit. But Ronald Reagan was. Reagan was not a hater. He came across as a nice guy who wouldn't start a war or throw old people out in the snow, despite the harsh things he sometimes said.George W. Bush ran as a nice guy in 2000. Remember the ""compassionate conservative''? Voters found Bush more likable than Al Gore. He turned out to be brash and reckless. His brother Jeb is trying to run as the real compassionate conservative. At his announcement speech, Jeb talked about  ""a nation filled with charitable hearts.'' He called for ""growth that lifts up the middle class -- all the families who haven't gotten a raise in 15 years.'' Bush is no moderate. He opposes same-sex marriage, but he does it using the language of tolerance: ""We should not push aside those who believe in traditional marriage.'' Bush argues for ""charitable hearts'' as the alternative to big government: ""We can shut down government if we all acted on our sense of consciousness about helping others.''Bush is distrusted by hard-line conservatives because he favors legal status, but not a path to citizenship, for illegal immigrants. Rather than change his position to meet the demands of Republican primary voters, he tries to make a virtue out of necessity, saying, ""I'm not going to change who I am.''Liberals tend to go for inspirational figures like Obama. They worry that Clinton is too hawkish and too close to big business. Bernie Sanders is likely to create a sensation early in the 2016 campaign by doing ""better than expected'' in Iowa and New Hampshire. The Iowa contest is a caucus, and caucuses are low-turnout events often dominated by activists. And Sanders is well known in New Hampshire. He comes from Vermont, right next door. Conservatives tend to go for tough guys, not guys who advertise their ""charitable hearts.'' Bush is unlikely to do well in the Iowa caucuses. New Hampshire Republicans sometimes show an anti-establishment streak, as they did in 1996 when Pat Buchanan beat Bob Dole in the New Hampshire Republican primary. Nevertheless, both Bush and Clinton will have the resources to come roaring back on Super Tuesday, March 1, when twelve contests are scheduled.A Clinton vs. Bush election sounds boring. But a tough liberal versus a nice conservative? That could be interesting: a race between two oxymorons."

They defy political stereotypes. But the ideal Democratic candidate is a tough liberal. And the ideal Republican candidate is a nice conservative. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush are aiming to meet those standards.The stereotype of a liberal is weak and indecisive. George McGovern was ""a thousand percent'' behind his running-mate until he dropped him from the ticket. Walter Mondale got pushed around by the special interests. Michael Dukakis rode in a tank. Barack Obama meets with defiance from his own party.We used to have plenty of tough liberals. Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur for insubordination. John Kennedy stood up to the Soviets in the Cuban missile crisis. Defy LBJ, and you'd probably wake up in the morning missing an important body part. Hillary Clinton aims to revive the tough liberal image. She describes herself as a ""fighter,'' just as she did when she first ran for President in 2008. ""If you know one thing, when I say I will fight for you, I will,'' she said in Ohio that year. Clinton mocked Obama, telling voters in Rhode Island, ""Now I can stand here and say, 'Let's just get everybody together. Let's get unified. The sky will open. The light will come down. Celestial choirs will be singing. And everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect.''' She added, ""Maybe I have just lived a little too long, but I have no illusions about how hard this is going to be.'' She won't mock Obama in 2016. But the contrast will be implicit. A Clinton supporter in Iowa put it this way: ""Obama's quiet, a studious person, a wonk, a constitutional lawyer. Hillary is more of an activist. And you need an activist when you have a Congress that puts obstacles in your way. An activist doesn't stop trying.''Clinton's campaign video is labeled ""Fighter.'' It opens with her saying, ""What is a fighter? To me, a fighter is someone who won't give up.'' Clinton proved it in 2008 by staying in the race until the very end. She risked being criticized for stubbornness. Instead, she won admiration for fortitude.The stereotype of a conservative is mean and nasty. Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich, Dick Cheney and Ted Cruz are not known for their generosity of spirit. But Ronald Reagan was. Reagan was not a hater. He came across as a nice guy who wouldn't start a war or throw old people out in the snow, despite the harsh things he sometimes said.George W. Bush ran as a nice guy in 2000. Remember the ""compassionate conservative''? Voters found Bush more likable than Al Gore. He turned out to be brash and reckless. His brother Jeb is trying to run as the real compassionate conservative. At his announcement speech, Jeb talked about  ""a nation filled with charitable hearts.'' He called for ""growth that lifts up the middle class -- all the families who haven't gotten a raise in 15 years.'' Bush is no moderate. He opposes same-sex marriage, but he does it using the language of tolerance: ""We should not push aside those who believe in traditional marriage.'' Bush argues for ""charitable hearts'' as the alternative to big government: ""We can shut down government if we all acted on our sense of consciousness about helping others.''Bush is distrusted by hard-line conservatives because he favors legal status, but not a path to citizenship, for illegal immigrants. Rather than change his position to meet the demands of Republican primary voters, he tries to make a virtue out of necessity, saying, ""I'm not going to change who I am.''Liberals tend to go for inspirational figures like Obama. They worry that Clinton is too hawkish and too close to big business. Bernie Sanders is likely to create a sensation early in the 2016 campaign by doing ""better than expected'' in Iowa and New Hampshire. The Iowa contest is a caucus, and caucuses are low-turnout events often dominated by activists. And Sanders is well known in New Hampshire. He comes from Vermont, right next door. Conservatives tend to go for tough guys, not guys who advertise their ""charitable hearts.'' Bush is unlikely to do well in the Iowa caucuses. New Hampshire Republicans sometimes show an anti-establishment streak, as they did in 1996 when Pat Buchanan beat Bob Dole in the New Hampshire Republican primary. Nevertheless, both Bush and Clinton will have the resources to come roaring back on Super Tuesday, March 1, when twelve contests are scheduled.A Clinton vs. Bush election sounds boring. But a tough liberal versus a nice conservative? That could be interesting: a race between two oxymorons."

Company Folders is the only printing company to offer a 365-day quality guarantee.Convincing your audience in a sales meeting to care about what you're saying is a challenge; even the word ""meeting"" is one that people tend to associate with boring, tedious minutiae.Fortunately, there are a few easy ways to improve a typical sales meeting. By following these simple rules that I've found work well over the years, you can help ensure the success of your business meetings -- both the ones you hold with your staff and the ones where you make the actual sales.1. Start and end with a bang.Start your meeting in a way that grabs your audience's attention and leave them with a good final impression. For staff sales meetings, a good way to start is with a bit of trivia, a brain teaser, a puzzle, a joke or something that gets them thinking and engaging.Keep the fun and games to a minimum when meeting with potential clients, but try using an anecdote or telling a story. I find that asking clients a question right off the bat (like ""What would your ideal marketing package look like?"") really helps to keep them actively engaged in the dialogue.End on a positive note and use the last part of the meeting to reiterate the message you want to convey. Try tying the ending to the beginning of the presentation, such as giving a follow-up detail related to your opening anecdote.2. Keep it short and streamlined.Many presenters make the mistake of thinking that long presentations have greater value than shorter ones. But consider how valuable your audience's time is. When your sales team spends time in a meeting, that's time during which they aren't making sales. The same goes for your potential clients.Too many messages or extraneous details weaken the effectiveness of your sales meetings. A shorter meeting gives you less opportunity to go off on tangents and allows you to streamline your ideas with a consistent tone throughout. In my experience meeting with clients, I've found that 2 to 3 hours is a good guideline, giving them enough time to understand your message without boring them to tears.3. Stay positive.Meetings with your sales team shouldn't focus on what's going wrong. If there are negative issues that need to be addressed, that should be the focus of an entirely different meeting. In meetings with my sales staff, I prefer to zero in on how the team has improved, the things they have learned, and what I can do to make their jobs easier. As a result, my team is significantly happier and more motivated.In client meetings, don't get into the habit of bad-mouthing the competition. There's no shame in wanting to show that you're offering a better product or service than everyone else, but do so by focusing on what makes you special, not what makes everyone else worse.4. Don't dominate the conversation.During a sales meeting with your staff, set aside time to answer their questions or ask some of your own. This means you can't just read from a script; you have to prepare for your meeting by going over potential questions, concerns and ideas that might pop up. Have a clear focus for what you want to accomplish so you can steer the conversation back whenever it gets sidetracked.There have been times when I've made assumptions about a potential client before really getting to know them, and it hindered my ability to make a sale. Be sure to listen to what they have to say and learn about what they value so that you can best direct them towards your message.5. Know your audience.When meeting with your own sales staff, try to get to know them on an individual basis. If you at least know everybody's name and what they do, that's a good start. Knowing more about their personalities can help you better present your message in a way that will resonate with them.My most successful sales meetings are the ones where I take time beforehand to research clients' values, history, and company culture. In the era of social media, this is an easier task than ever before -- but there's a fine line between doing your research and cyber-stalking. For example, it's okay to mention the client's college background, since that information is usually easily accessible. But when you start talking about their elementary school, you've gone too far.6. Use custom-printed materials.My company specializes in printed marketing collateral, and I'm constantly hearing from thankful clients who have had successful sales meetings with persuasive, professional-looking materials -- so we use them too. Whether you give them to your audience or just use one for your own notes, materials printed with your logo help the attendees of your sales meeting connect with your brand.For your sales staff, using custom-printed materials helps build a sense of team spirit. Custom materials also make useful leave-behind items for sales meetings with clients because they allow you to include a wealth of information in a branded package.7. Acknowledge the entire room.In one of my very first sales meetings, I forgot to greet someone who turned out to be the most important person in the room -- definitely embarrassing. So here's one last trick for sales meetings to keep up your sleeve: if someone is in the room with you, there's a good reason for it. Acknowledging everyone at the meeting (no matter how small their contribution might be) is an easy way to build trust with your audience -- and failing to do so is an easy way to lose that trust, too.Ask meeting attendees for their opinions even if they're not part of the sales staff -- they might not have all the answers, but they may be able to offer everybody a fresh perspective or a creative solution.This is even more important when having a sales meeting with a potential client. If the client has invited someone to sit in on the meeting, remember that this is someone whose opinion the client values."

Incessantly egging on my friends and warming up my audience, I ask again, ""Ready...? Here we go!"" As I squat, I position myself to execute my next escapade. Today's task: exploding a juice box.There was always something inexplicably attractive about receiving attention, so throughout my childhood, the sound of laughter was my muse. I had an appetite for approbation (clearly not from teachers, but from my peers), and nothing was more satisfying than earning the missing-tooth smiles of my immature friends. Seated politely at their desks, my poor classmates were trying to enjoy lunch peacefully, but what is a meal without a show, I thought. And with that, I plopped onto my juice box. Unfortunately, my stunt failed; the juice simply poured out of the container without creating the mushroom cloud of beverage I had envisioned. Despite this disappointment, my friends reacted just as I had expected, jumping to evade the anticipated blast radius, screaming in disgust, and the odd few, giving me the drug I desired most: laughter. The high was incredible, but my ecstasy was short-lived. Searching for smiles, I turned to see a less-than-pleased teacher who, hearing the disruption, summoned me with a beckoning finger curl. After being reprimanded, my antics led to another level of attention I had not anticipated. She chronicled my behavior in an email to my parents. Needless to say, my juice box bomb awarded me an ill-flattering but well-fitting behavioral report reflecting the day's escapades. In middle school, I could no longer get away with such blatant misbehavior. Instead, I disrupted class with lackluster jokes, only provoking laughter because of their inappropriate timing. But, I was soon struck by the gravity of being the class clown: my reputation was outweighing my innocence, defining my experience as a student, and compromising my academic life, despite my intelligence. The repercussions of my behavior were no longer worth the reward of a few chuckles. This recognition defined my maturation and freed me from my self-imposed shackles; I would no longer be a slave to laughter. It was time for the next chapter in my life, one defined by academic focus and exemplary school citizenship. This chapter (entitled ""Self-Improvement""), was lengthy, but by the next chapter (""New Beginnings""), I emerged as a redefined character, one whose hunger for attention and laughter evolved into a thirst for knowledge and service. The more I focused on academics, the more I enjoyed learning; the more my peers and teachers believed in me, the more I wanted to give them a reason to keep their faith. Ironically, being a class clown may be one of best things that ever happened to me. It shaped me into the person I have become, and helped me to develop my new muse: leadership. Leadership supported my maturation, as I began to realize I could positively influence my peers. My classroom antics gave me confidence and a voice to embrace public speaking -- even though at the time, it was in a negative light. Being the class clown gave me the foundation I needed to be elected class president three consecutive years, and ultimately, president of the student body. Now, I am confident enough to represent the student body as its spokesperson to school administrators and make recommendations to improve the experiences of all students at school. The transformation from class clown to class president was not easy, but revealed my full potential: I learned that actions speak louder than words, and new actions speak louder than old ones. In truth, I still appreciate laughter. However, I now recognize there is a time and place for everything, because integrity and citizenship take precedence over laughter. So while I am more mature, I will remember my class clown episodes as a souvenir - and as a roadmap for the rest of my life. Drew Crichlow will be a freshman at Yale in the fall and just graduated from Montclair Kimberley Academy."
