Casey, a 1992 case that is now at risk of becoming dead letter if the Supreme Court deflects from a precedent called the ""undue burden"" standard.That precedent was a joint compromise by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy -- largely upholding the promise of Roe v. Wade, and making it clear that states could only go so far in their efforts to regulate a woman's right to end a pregnancy.That constitutional standard is now front and center in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a case from Texas that the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Wednesday and that is the most significant abortion standoff the court has heard in nearly a decade.The case matters because ""unnecessary health regulations"" is precisely how abortion rights advocates describe H.B.2, the Texas law at the heart of the case. It demands that abortion clinics upgrade their facilities to resemble mini-hospitals and that abortion doctors have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals -- requirements so onerous that they threaten to shutter all but 10 clinics in the state. Before H.B.2 went into effect in 2014, there were more than 40 abortion facilities in Texas.A decision in the case will not only settle what happens with H.B.2, but also with women's choice itself -- whether it's truly a right that should carry the force of law for good, or merely a theory that should be left behind.But the Supreme Court is undergoing change. Before February, the fate of abortion rights rested in the hands of a nine-member Supreme Court. Prior to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, conservative centrist Kennedy, a Ronald Reagan appointee, was expected to be the pivotal vote in the case.Kennedy's power is now somewhat diminished, but he remains a key figure because a 4-to-4 deadlock of the justices would allow H.B.2 to stand, leaving women in Texas with severely limited options for obtaining abortions. A split decision also wouldn't set a binding precedent for the future of reproductive rights nationwide. Lest anyone think the danger of legal uncertainty isn't real: Just last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit -- the same court that last year upheld the Texas regulations before the Supreme Court -- allowed a similar Louisiana law to go into effect, forcing all but one abortion clinic in the state to close.  So all eyes will be on Kennedy on Wednesday, and there's every reason to believe he might cherish an opportunity to make history one more time and help clarify what an undue burden on the right to choose means, if it means anything at all.In a sense, the Whole Woman's Health case brings together two things Kennedy deeply cares about: states' rights and an individual's right to autonomy and dignity. The two can't always coexist, and when confronted with both, Kennedy often has chosen to prioritize the individual over the state -- most notably when the rights of gay people and certain criminal offenders are at stake.But the issue at hand isn't as clear-cut for Kennedy. Without O'Connor and Souter on the court to help him strike a pragmatic balance, he has been more than willing to rule against abortion rights. The last time he did, in 2007, he led a conservative majority -- then rounded out by Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as Justices Scalia, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas -- to restrain women's choice with sexist, paternalistic language.""Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child,"" Kennedy wrote. ""While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained. Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow.""Abortion, he wrote, was ""so fraught with emotional consequence"" that he considered regulations addressing it to be ""a legitimate concern of the State.""That position is almost irreconcilable with his views in the Casey case 15 years prior, the decision for which he is believed to have contributed a florid passage extolling the importance of reproductive choice.""These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment,"" he wrote then. ""At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.""Inspiring words, no doubt, but indicative that Kennedy is far from principled when it comes to abortion.

2,POLITICS,How Far Might The GOP Go To Thwart Donald Trump At Its Convention?,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/delegate-calvinball-a-go-go_us_56d5b9f3e4b0bf0dab336bf1,"Contemplating the ""hell with the lid off"" scenario.",2016-03-01,"If Donald Trump is leading and the GOP establishment decides to take measures during the convention to make someone else the 2016 nominee, party leaders better be sure they know what they're doing.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d5d25a1e0000950070f13c.jpeg?cache=z8cBARNVEV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In just about any election year, political observers hoping for something other than an anodyne set of political conventions that proceed from opening invocation to the inevitable balloon drop along a well-strategized through line of political brand-management will fantasize about a floor fight. Typically, dreams of a contested (or if you must, ""brokered"") convention boil down to a raft of wishful thinking. And speaking of wishful thinking, how's that effort to stop Donald Trump from claiming the GOP nomination going?Yes, to borrow a tawdry cliche, this time it's different. As Trump has risen in the polls, the fears of the GOP establishment -- which loathes the prospect of handing the keys to its kingdom over to an authoritarian glazed doughnut -- have escalated. Trump has been the best of friends to the contested convention fantasists because of his knack for pushing traumatized Republican Party fixers out of their warrens and into the pages of newspapers.The only real question is: How far would GOP elites go to thwart a Trump nomination? Today we'll consider the possibility that they'll issue a Code Black, and blow up their own convention from the inside.At The New York Times, Trip Gabriel and the paper's Upshot team have paired a thorough walk-through of the Republican Party's delegate selection system with a taut data visualization of what it would take for Marco Rubio -- who is, at this point, arguably the one man who might (I am being so generous here) thwart Trump outright in the primary contests yet to come. Suffice it to say, it's a daunting prospect for the Florida senator, one that requires multiple reverses in fortune and some downright implausible events to transpire. Per Gabriel:The Rubio campaign is hoping for several things in the coming weeks: that Mr. Cruz will withdraw after a poor finish on Super Tuesday; that Mr. Rubio will carry the moderate states of Minnesota and Virginia that day; and that on March 15 — the first day of voting in big winner-take-all states — Mr. Rubio will sweep the 99 delegates in his home state of Florida.To put it delicately, there's no aspect to this path to victory that's not some sort of ""bite down and pray"" situation. The whole ""winning Florida"" part is perhaps the most problematic element here. The current HuffPost Pollster polling average model of Florida has Trump leading Rubio, 42.1 percent to 23.8 percent, and Florida is a winner-take-all affair. Worse for Rubio, tens of thousands of Floridians have already voted.It's at this point that you start to consider the contested convention scenario. As the Upshot team notes, ""If Mr. Rubio struggles on Super Tuesday and can’t at least split the delegates on March 15, his campaign will be in trouble. But he still might be able to earn enough votes to force a brokered convention by preventing Mr. Trump from earning an outright majority of delegates.""The idea here is that if the rest of the GOP field holds Trump below the 1,237 delegates needed to notch the nomination outright, it creates the possibility that there will be no nominee after the first round of balloting at the convention. From there, a not-insignificant number of convention delegates would become ""unbound,"" and thus eligible to vote for any candidate. (There is wide variance from one state delegation to the next as to the number of delegates who would be thus freed from their commitment, and at what point in the balloting process this freedom would come.)As Politico's Ben Schreckinger reported in February, campaigns and super PACs have been quietly laying the groundwork to capitalize on this potential scenario for a few weeks. But deep down in Gabriel's New York Times piece comes the suggestion of a more radical solution to the GOP's Trump problem (emphasis mine):“I think the establishment will do anything in their power to try to stop Donald Trump at the national convention,” said John Patrick Yob, the former delegate strategist for Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who dropped out of the race on Feb. 3.That's quite the either/or situation! There's been lots of talk about a potential unbinding of the delegates after the first ballot at the convention, but this is the first time I can recall anyone suggesting that the party's rule-makers might select a full ""Calvinball"" option, in which delegates are unbound from the jump by an abrupt rule change. That possibility has hitherto been almost unthinkable, and may yet be near unallowable. But here we are, imagining a situation in which the Republican Party makes an outright choice for a floor fight.The thing is, party elites can redraw the rules at the convention.The current rules that govern the process were, in fact, determined on the floor of the 2012 convention. At that time, party leaders decided to enact rules that effectively sidelined Ron Paul-supporting delegates, preventing them from delaying or intruding on leaders' desired outcome: a quick and orderly nomination for Mitt Romney. Subsequent wheeler-dealing enabled the party to erect a primary system that they thought would lead to an easy nomination process in this election cycle. (Gabriel documents at length how Trump himself ended up the beneficiary of the party's designs in what I'm sure will be a fantastic cover story for the upcoming issue of The Journal Of Unintended Consequences.)Should the Republican Party's rule-makers somehow bring this about, it would be a whale-sized gamble. In the first place, it's probably not a good idea to make any broad assumptions about what obstacles Trump would fail to surmount. There's every possibility that his campaign will send loyal delegates to the convention and circumvent this chaos. And as they say, if you come at the king, you best not miss.But even hitting the king in this instance would likely reap the whirlwind for the Republican Party. In the first place, can you imagine Donald Trump being sanguine about this outcome? Can you imagine his die-hard supporters accepting it? If you can, you've not been paying attention. If the GOP establishment, through its establishment machinations, successfully subverts the will of Trump's anti-establishment supporters, the backlash it would engender would be white hot in its anger.In this situation, the Republicans had damn well better win the general election, and quickly and seamlessly enact a conservative agenda. And that agenda, once enacted, had better start paying real, discernible dividends to the voters that make up Trump's disaffected populist base, or that base will rain holy hell on the GOP for many election cycles to come.That list of must-dos, which would inevitably arise if Trump were taken down in the ultimate backroom deal, is not a list of goals that the GOP seems close to being ready to achieve. But its desperation to supersede Trump's nomination may trump everything else.Jason Linkins edits ""Eat The Press"" for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast ""So, That Happened.""

The day after a group of sexual assault survivors joined Lady Gaga onstage at the Academy Awards, King revealed that she was abused as a minor in a series of powerful messages on social media. Inspired by her powerful Oscar performance, King tweeted at Gaga, thanking the singer for helping her to come to terms with ""years of abuse as a minor in the industry.""Gaga responded on Tuesday, calling King ""a warrior leading the way,"" before sharing a post about the experience of standing among the sexual assault survivors on the Oscar stage. The model and actress, who is best known for her role as Lemon Breeland on the CW's ""Hart of Dixie,"" followed up her initial tweet with a longer Instagram post.In the moving caption, King opens up about her abuse -- ""It started at 12"" -- and mentions many individuals, including Taylor Swift and Lena Dunham, who have supported her along the path to self-acceptance and allowed her speak honestly about her experience. ""Thank you to myself to not choosing to not make this a cover story though that was what was suggested to me but to express from my heart to you all personally which felt the most honest way for me to speak,"" King wrote in her post. ""Thank you to my Soul, body, mind, emotions, my inner child, my younger self, I love you. It's a night of celebration, of change, of not being ashamed of your race, creed color, situation, circumstances and environment, or past.""""Now I am free, somewhat,"" she continued. ""Thank you for the switch that went off inside finally when I realized my silence said I cannot help nor change and that is not who I am. I love you all very much for creating a safe space. The time is now.""The ""Sin City"" actress also mentions her husband, director Kyle Newman, whom she married in 2007 and with whom she has two children, James and Leo. Taylor Swift, who King thanks for ""being there no matter what,"" is Leo's godmother.King's story comes at a crucial moment, as the conversation surrounding sexual assault has revealed that even those at the highest levels of the entertainment industry are not safe from abuse. Gaga opened up about being raped as a teenager in a TimesTalk in December and pop star Kesha continues to battle DJ/producer Dr. Luke, who she accused of sexual assault and battery, in court. By lending her voice to the chorus of individuals calling for real change in how we address and prevent these crimes, King serves as an inspiration for the hundreds of thousands of people who are victims of sexual assault every year. If you or someone you know has been affected by sexual violence, it's not your fault. You are not alone. Help is available 24/7 through the National Sexual Assault Hotline: 800-656-HOPE and online.rainn.org."

It is scheduled for a final vote later this week.Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) authored the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015, which is co-sponsored by 35 senators from both sides of the aisle. ""The stories behind the heroin and prescription drug epidemic are heartbreaking,"" Portman wrote Monday in the Washington Examiner. ""The numbers are shocking, with more than 100 Americans dying from overdoses every day. Congress can help, and we must act.""Senators began championing the bill earlier this month, holding press conferences and speaking on the Senate floor about how the heroin and opioid epidemics have devastated people in their states. The shift is a notable change from the messaging that has dominated the war on drugs in previous decades.""The prescription opioid and heroin epidemic does not discriminate by demographic or socioeconomic status, by age or gender,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said ahead of the vote. ""In my home state of Kentucky, drug overdoses continue to outpace the number of fatalities from traffic accidents.""The bipartisan bill would also provide incentives for states and local communities to pursue prevention and education programs, institute treatment programs that have been successful in the past and encourage first responders to use naloxone to reverse overdoses. If it passes, the legislation will be one of the few pieces of legislation the Republican-controlled Congress has agreed on in 2016. The ongoing battle over whether President Barack Obama can nominate a replacement for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in an election year is setting up lawmakers for an even more contentious and challenging few months.

That comment was mild compared to what Trump did last week during a rally in Las Vegas, when he said he'd like to ""punch"" a protester in the face.""In the old days,"" Trump added, protesters would be ""carried out on stretchers.""And in November, when a well-known black activist in Birmingham, Alabama, interrupted a Trump event, the GOP presidential front-runner told security to ""get him the hell out of here.""He later said in an interview that the man was ""so obnoxious and so loud"" that ""maybe he should have been roughed up.""This confrontational approach is standard at Trump events, and it's spread to his supporters. At a January rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, Trump supporters ripped up protesters' signs and threatened to hurt them. This approach couldn't be more different from how Vice President Joe Biden handled a particularly terrible protester Saturday night. Biden was giving the keynote address at the California Democrats State Convention when a man started yelling about a particularly delicate topic: Biden's son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in May. The protester claimed that Beau died due to cell phone radiation. The crowd booed him. The vice president, in contrast to Trump, tried to calm down the crowd.""Let's not act like Republicans,"" Biden added. Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

In his opening monologue, host Chris Rock gleefully went after the Academy’s all-white nominations and the broader practice of skipping over people of color for opportunities in Hollywood. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles event sparked conversation and #OscarsSoWhite awareness on social media, while others chose to boycott in protest.Here are some of the most talked about diversity moments from this year’s Academy Awards:Chris Rock spared no time jumping into #OscarsSoWhite ...... Pulling out some jokes that rang uncomfortably true.Meanwhile, Hollywood diversity was on everyone's minds ...No matter their race ...Because the Oscars this year totally missed the mark ...Chris Rock offered a solution to addressing the issue ...Notable black celebs expressed their thoughts on the red carpet ...""A lot of people have asked me why I'm here tonight, and the thing I'm thinking about is, if you look at the history of movements, the history of change, a lot of the voices are needed at the table. I really respect and actually admire some of the people who are not here tonight, I really get it, but for me, I felt like my voice -- in my heart -- my voice is best used at the table."" -- Kerry Washington""If you really want to protest, then don't go to the movies that don't have the people you want to see."" -- Whoopi Goldberg""We're not going to get to the promised land until we regard one another as part of the same family. Black, Latino as one family. That's America."" --Louis Gossett Jr.“We know it’s obvious that it’s a problem, and now we want to work toward a solution. I want to be a part of that change. I’m an Academy member now, so I want to be a voice for some of the black, brown people, and women -- the people who usually get overlooked. It’s not just an Oscar problem, it’s a Hollywood issue of us not seeing a lot of inclusion in the films being made and the people that make the decisions. And we also know it’s an American issue. So my thing is, I know that we’re gonna make this change. People had to speak up for this change to happen. But I’m also wanting this change to happen for the kids in Flint, I’m also wanting it for the people in Chicago that’s dealing with the violence right now.” -- CommonAnd on the stage ...“I want to take a moment to applaud all of my actors and actresses of color that didn’t get nominated tonight. The reason why I say that is because I want them to understand that tonight should not determine the hard work and effort that you put into your craft. At the end of the day we love what we do and we’re breaking major ground doing it. These problems of today will eventually become problems of the old. Let’s not let this negative issue of diversity beat us. Let’s continue to do what we do best and work hard.” -- Kevin HartMeanwhile, others took action from outside the event ...“You are out of time…This will be the last night of an all-white Oscars.” -- Al Sharpton Judging from an eight-year low in ratings, let's hope this is the last #OscarsSoWhite!"

The awards show tried to toe a tricky line -- celebrating the night's overwhelmingly white nominees, while also calling itself and the Hollywood at-large out for yet another year of snubbing filmmakers and actors of color. The show did this largely through host Chris Rock, whose opening monologue was a series of insightful comments about Hollywood's diversity problem mixed with off-color observations about Hollywood sexism and digs at Jada Pinkett Smith.But if the Academy Awards was any indication of the overall problem with Hollywood, it's that the conversation was too focused on black and white. Much of the diversity talk was on the lack of black representation at the Oscars, with little mention of Latinos, Asians and other non-black people of color.It took Sacha Baron Cohen coming out in character to present an award as Ali G (from ""The Ali G Show"") for there to even be a mention on the Oscar stage about the other people of color needing representation in Hollywood, and even then that came in the form of a quip about ""dem hard-working little yellow people wiv tiny dongs... minions.""Rock received his biggest and most awkward laugh from the audience during his opening monologue when he said, ""I’m sure there were no black nominees some of those years. Say '62 or '63, and black people did not protest. Why? Because we had real things to protest at the time, you know? We had real things to protest. You know, we’re too busy being raped and lynched to care about who won best cinematographer.""And while his last statement rightfully may have made many feel uncomfortable, it's true, black people did have much more pressing issues to protest. Even now, in the midst of the Flint water crisis and police brutality, many would argue that a few nominations at an award show are largely irrelevant. We can recognize that while people of color aren't necessarily dying from not getting more opportunities in the film industry, the lack of opportunity is symptomatic of institutional racism as a whole. So, now that Hollywood's biggest night is over, what have we learned? And where do we go from here? The fact that the Oscars made somewhat of an effort to acknowledge its whiteness is certainly a sign of progress, as are the initiatives the Academy's taken to diversify its members. But the white producers, directors, casting agents and writers in the Hollywood and Highland Center auditorium audience last night, who laughed with awkward enthusiasm at Chris Rock's punchlines need to also be called out and held accountable in the same way as the Academy. These white industry movers and shakers have to realize that #OscarsSoWhite is really #HollywoodSoWhite, and the question of diversity and inclusion isn't just a trending topic that will die out after one night of self-aware jokes. Oscars night is over, but we still have work to do. "

That is disqualifying right there,"" Scarborough said Monday. ""To say you don’t know about the Ku Klux Klan? You don’t know about David Duke?""“Is he really so stupid that he thinks Southerners aren’t offended by the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke?"" Scarborough continued. ""Is he really so ignorant of Southern voters that he thinks this is the way to their heart? To go neutral, to play Switzerland when you're talking about the Klan?"" Over the weekend, Trump failed three times to refuse the endorsement of both the KKK and David Duke, a former leader of the white supremacist group.""Honestly, I don’t know David Duke. I don’t believe I’ve ever met him. I’m pretty sure I didn’t meet him. And I just don’t know anything about him,"" Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper.But Trump later blamed his hesitancy to condemn Duke on a ""bad earpiece,"" claiming he had previously disavowed Duke. ""I was sitting in a house in Florida, with a bad earpiece,"" Trump told NBC's ""Today"" on Monday. ""I could hardly hear what he's saying. I hear various groups. I don't mind disavowing anyone. I disavowed Duke the day before at a major conference.""Scarborough is one of many slamming Trump for the move. At a campaign rally Monday morning, Trump's GOP primary rival Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Trump is ""unelectable now."" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), also a GOP presidential hopeful, called the KKK ""abhorrent"" in a tweet Sunday.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are vying to win the Latino vote, which could be pivotal in Super Tuesday primary states like Texas and Colorado.Both candidates sought an endorsement from the group, which helps elect candidates who support Latino issues. They chose Clinton in an internal vote that concluded Sunday, according to Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), the PAC's chairman. He declined to reveal the vote tally, but it's safe to say it swung heavily Clinton's way, since a majority of Congressional Hispanic Caucus members have already endorsed her, and only one of them, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), has endorsed Sanders.""I have always been proud to stand with the Latino community, not only in fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, but fighting for all families to have the chance to get ahead and stay ahead,"" Clinton said, adding that she stands with the caucus on issues like the economy, wage gap, environment and education. Cárdenas and three other CHC members at a press conference praised Clinton's record and platform, while criticizing Sanders either implicitly or explicitly. Clinton has been a longtime champion of the Latino community and is not a ""Johnny-come-lately,"" the members said. They said they weren't interested in a candidate who just says the right things -- they were looking for someone who could actually achieve his or her promises.""We love Sen. Sanders as a senator,"" said Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.), who chairs the caucus. ""But I think that oftentimes he has some a very utopian idea of how he can reform the country and Washington, D.C. in particular. ... [Clinton] has built up those relationships in order to navigate and to try to get things done in a place, admittedly, very little gets done. I think that makes her far superior.""Cárdenas said they respect Sanders, but ""he has failed to stand with our community time and time again on issues that mattered most to us,"" noting the senator voted against the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill.Clinton touted her support of that bill in her statement, though she didn't point out that Sanders opposed it. She said she ""will fight for comprehensive immigration reform legislation from the moment I take office.""Sánchez and Cárdenas, joined by Reps. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), said they hope the person ultimately elected president will work with them on issues important to Latinos, such as education, health care, the economy and immigration. Cárdenas said he wants a president to ""hit the ground running"" -- a potential jab at President Barack Obama, who promised to push for immigration reform in his first term but didn't actually do so in a substantive way until his second.""We've seen in the history of this country that some people have made it a priority, but it's in the second term that we see them start the momentum,"" Cárdenas said.This article was updated with a statement from Clinton and details from a press conference."

http://publicreligion.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PRRI-Religious-Affiliation-Republicans-Super-Tuesday.jpg","Super Tuesday's primaries put hundreds of delegates at stake. Religion looms large, especially in the South. And national polls show Donald Trump rising among Republican voters. This is HuffPollster for Monday, February 29, 2016.WHAT’S AT STAKE ON SUPER TUESDAY - On March 1, Democrats will award 880 delegates from 11 states, plus an additional 28 abroad and from American Samoa. Republicans will award 661 delegates from 11 states. While polls have done reasonably well so far,, there's not a lot of polling to go on for many of these states, especially outside of Texas, Georgia and Virginia.The biggest prizes for the GOP are Texas, Georgia and Tennessee - HuffPollster: ""Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton holds a massive lead over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) heading into Super Tuesday -- the day the greatest number of states hold primary elections -- according to a set of three new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls of Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. On the Republican side, Donald Trump is making a strong showing in Georgia and Tennessee while Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) leads in his home state….HuffPost Pollster shows similar leads for Trump in Georgia and Cruz in Texas. Not enough recent polling has been conducted in Tennessee to draw any projection."" [HuffPost] Most delegates at stake for Democrats in Texas, Georgia and Massachusetts - HuffPost Pollster’s averages show considerable leads for Clinton in two of the three biggest states for Democrats. She leads in Texas, with 60 percent to Sanders’ 34 percent, and by an even bigger margin in Georgia, with 64 percent to Sanders' 31 percent. Polls in Massachusetts, though, suggest a closer race. While there's too little data to be certain, the HuffPost Pollster average shows Clinton just slightly ahead. Appealing to religious groups matters in many Super Tuesday states - Michael Lipka: ""Religious groups rarely vote as a fully unified bloc….But looking at the religious makeup of individual states, and at each party’s potential voters within a particular state, can still help in understanding the electoral landscape….Republicans in general tend to place a higher level of importance on religion than do Democrats, and this holds true across the Super Tuesday states. Two-thirds of Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP in these states (66%) say religion is very important to them, compared with 53% of Democrats....Overall, nearly half of all people in the 12 Super Tuesday states who identify as or lean toward the Republican Party (47%) are evangelical Protestants….Among Democrats, people with no religious affiliation are the largest group in three of the 11 states that will vote Tuesday."" [Pew]White Christians dominate in the GOP - Robert Jones: ""Republicans’ key base of white Christians is well represented across the Super Tuesday states. Nearly three-quarters (74 percent) of Republicans in all Super Tuesday states are white Christians. In fact, a majority of Republicans in every Super Tuesday state identify as white Christian….In comparison, Democrats in Super Tuesday states are much more religiously diverse, with Democrats more than half as likely as Republicans to identify as white Christian. A plurality (42 percent) of Democrats in the Super Tuesday states identify as non-white Christians, with 30 percent identifying as white Christians.""

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime).TRUMP REACHES NEW HIGH NATIONALLY - Jennifer Agiesta, on a new CNN/ORC poll: “Trump has expanded his lead over the diminished field to capture the support of nearly half of Republican voters…[T]he new survey finds Trump's lead is dominant, and his support tops that of his four remaining opponents combined. The businessman tops his nearest competitor by more than 30 points: 49% back Trump, 16% Marco Rubio, 15% Ted Cruz, 10% Ben Carson and 6% John Kasich. Trump's supporters are incredibly enthusiastic about the coming election, and largely committed in their support for him. Nearly 8 in 10 say that they are more enthusiastic about voting this year than in previous elections, among Republicans who are not supporting Trump, just 39% say they are more enthusiastic than in years past. Likewise, 78% of Trump's backers say they will definitely support him vs. 22% who say they could still change their minds. Among those backing other candidates, 57% say they are committed to their chosen candidate.” [CNN]Trump continues to solidify GOP support - Trump’s 49 percent support among Republicans in the new CNN/ORC poll is a new high for the businessman, who's seen his numbers climb since the beginning of the primary season. HuffPost Pollster’s average has his support at 42 percent, up from 36 percent at the beginning of the month. National primary polls should be viewed with caution, since there is no national primary. But the polls are a good indicator that Republicans nationally are warming to Trump as he wins in the early states.

A video shared on the Baltimore Animal Rescue and Care Shelter's Facebook page last week features surgical assistant Dennis Moses lovingly cradling a rescue pit bull after the pup was spayed.According to the clip's description, the pup whose name is Maddie was feeling a bit disoriented as the anesthesia wore off, so Moses took it upon himself to comfort her. Watch as the caring technician rocks a sleepy Maddie back and forth while kissing her. Bailey Deacon, BARCS director of communications, told The Huffington Post that Maddie, who'd been surrendered by her previous owners, met her new humans, Andrew Isbell and his family, earlier this month. However, the pup couldn't go home until she was at a specific weight and age, had completed her full vaccinations and got spayed.The pooch underwent the spay procedure last Wednesday. Deacon said that contrary to what many may think, the dog was crying while coming off of anesthesia because she was confused -- not because she was in pain. When Moses saw that the pooch was crying, he took her out into the hall to try and make her feel better. Though this particular video ended up going viral, Deacon told HuffPost that Moses' gesture isn't rare and a volunteer just happened to catch this instance on camera. Moses regularly tries to make the animals feel at home. ""It's just another one of the normal moments here,"" she said. ""He actually sings to them too.""As for Maddie, she's been settling in nicely with her new family and even has quite a bit of snuggle time -- especially with her 11-month-old ""sister"" Jordan.

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This piece comes to us courtesy of EdSource, where it was originally published.With the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the California Teachers Association will likely gain an unexpected victory, at least for now, in its legal battle to continue the right to require all teachers to pay the costs of collective bargaining.That was the issue raised in Friedrichs v. the State of California and the CTA, which the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on by June. Court observers had predicted that Scalia would join the four other conservative justices to make a 5-4 decision overturning Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, a four-decades old Supreme Court decision that said that states could require all public employees to split the expenses of bargaining, known as “agency” or “fair share” fees.A majority decision agreeing with the plaintiffs – Rebecca Friedrichs, an elementary school teacher in the Savanna School District in Anaheim and nine other non-union teachers – could severely weaken the financial health and political clout of the CTA and other public employee unions. The suing teachers contend that mandatory fees coerce them to support bargaining positions they disagree with, violating their constitutional right to free speech.With a possible 4-4 tie, the court would defer to the ruling of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on the side of the union. If that were to happen, the Court of Appeals decision would uphold only California’s law permitting mandatory fair-share fees and not affect the other two dozen states that also have passed similar statutes. (Tom Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog, suggests that the Supreme Court could decide to have cases like Friedrichs reargued, once Scalia’s successor takes a seat on the court. Goldstein cites precedents for doing this in his article.) In the remaining “right-to-work” or open-shop states, in which all dues and fees are voluntary, unions generally are weaker and the percentage of membership is smaller.In its pro-forma ruling in 2014, the Appeals Court didn’t consider the merits of the case, nor was it asked to. The Washington, D.C.-based Center for Individual Rights, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the plaintiff teachers, had asked the lower courts to expedite a decision without a full trial so that the Supreme Court could directly reconsider the Abood decision.The center’s lawyers had reason to believe the majority on the court would agree with them. In a ruling in 2014 in a related case, Harris v. Quinn, Scalia and other conservatives called the Abood decision “troubling.” Although the court didn’t overturn Abood then on technical grounds, Scalia and other conservatives in a concurring opinion invited a lawsuit directly challenging it. The Friedrichs lawsuit was that challenge, and the court agreed last fall to hear the case.In establishing fair-share dues, the court in Abood distinguished between collective bargaining expenses, covering pay and working conditions, and money to underwrite a union’s support of candidates, its political positions and lobbying local school boards and the Legislature on non-bargaining issues. Teachers are not obligated to pay for politicking, it said.For California teachers, about $600 of their average $1,000 annual union dues goes toward their fair-share fees; it is divided among their local union, the California Teachers Association and the National Education Association for their expertise and representation. Teachers who don’t want to join the union and pay the political portion of union dues must annually sign a statement of their intention to opt out.In a 1991 decision, Scalia defended the right of public-employee unions to charge fair-share fees to cover collective bargaining expenses, since they are legally required to negotiate on behalf of union and non-union workers. Mandatory fees would solve the problem of “free-riders” who benefited from the contract without paying for negotiation expenses, Scalia reasoned.But in oral arguments in Friedrichs last month (see page 45 of the transcript), Scalia indicated he had changed his mind and would join the other four conservative justices. “The problem is that everything that is collectively bargained with the government is within the political sphere, almost by definition,” including bargaining over pay increases, Scalia said, adopting the key argument of the plaintiffs.The Center for Individual Rights’ strategy of expediting its lawsuit may have backfired with Scalia’s death. Whether the CTA and other public unions face another lawsuit like Friedrichs any time soon will depend on who becomes Scalia’s successor. President Obama would like to make that choice – and, with his third appointment to the court, tip control of the court to moderates and liberals. But Republican U.S. senatorsvowed Sunday not to vote on a nominee, leaving the choice to the next president.The National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, the parent unions for the California Teachers Association and the California Federation of Teachers, a co-defendant in the Friedrichs case, last year endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. With the court’s ideological majority now in the balance, Scalia’s death has raised the stakes in November for unions and their opponents.In a statement Sunday, Joshua Pechthalt, president of the California Federation of Teachers said that Scalia’s death “is likely to result in a delay of the Friedrichs case but it’s not certain and I think the public sector unions and the education unions have to continue the organizing we have been doing with the assumption nothing has changed.”But he also agreed that the vacancy on the court “underscores the importance of this presidential race.” The next president could nominate one, maybe more Supreme Court judges, he said, adding, “These judges could be interpreting the constitution for the next generation, including issues related to labor, women’s rights, voting rights, affirmative action, the environment and social justice.”"

Morris told CNN's Jim Acosta that he stepped about 18 inches outside the press pen before a guy ""grabbed me by the neck and started choking me and slammed me to the ground.""Independent Journal reporter Joe Perticone wrote that the altercation began when an unidentified agent tried preventing Morris from covering protesters. Morris reportedly responded ""Fuck you"" to the agent's command. In addition to barring and ejecting journalists from rallies, Trump's campaign has threatened reporters with blacklisting if they leave the designated press area, or pen, to cover newsworthy events happening off stage, such as protests.The Secret Service has enforced the campaign's press restrictions, although the agency's role is to protect the candidate, not limit media access. 'The Secret Service is aware of an incident involving an employee of the Secret Service that occurred earlier today in Radford, VA,"" an agency spokesman said in a statement. ""At this time, our local field office is working with their law enforcement partners to determine the exact circumstances that led up to this incident. The Secret Service will provide further details as warranted once additional facts surrounding the situation are known.""The Trump campaign said in a statement that it was not aware of all the details regarding the incident between the Time photographer and Secret Service agent, and directed enquiries to law enforcement. Some journalists who were at the scene tweeted the disturbing video of Morris being taken down:After the incident, Morris said he put his hand on the agent's neck in order to demonstrate how he had been choked. Conservative site Breitbart News highlighted an image of this moment to suggest the journalist provoked the agent. Morris, who kicked the agent after being pushed to the ground, ""expressed remorse for his part in escalating the confrontation,"" according to a statement from Time magazine.“We are relieved that Chris is feeling OK,"" a Time spokesperson said, ""and we expect him to be back at work soon."""
17,POLITICS,Marco Rubio Tries To Salvage His Campaign With Laughter,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-super-tuesday_us_56d395bce4b03260bf773b89,"A rabbi, a priest and a Republican presidential candidate walk into a bar...",2016-02-29,"Marco Rubio gestures during a rally in Richmond, Virginia, Sunday, Feb. 28, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PURCELLVILLE, Va. - Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) strategy for winning the GOP presidential nomination is simple: please everyone. Shouldn't be that hard, right? Rubio was certainly giving it his all on Sunday, delivering a punchy and at times genuinely funny address to voters in Purcellville, an exurban town on the outskirts of the Washington, D.C. metro area. For a guy who only recently was accused of being too wooden and was trailed by a Democratic-allied operative in a robot costume, it was a remarkable turnaround. When a protester appeared behind Rubio, sporting a coat hanger and a sign that read ""MARCO RUBIO EMPTY SUIT,"" the candidate wasted no time in vamping, quite effectively, on the interruption. ""'Empty suit,'"" Rubio remarked, clearly enjoying himself, ""at least my suit wasn't made in China!"" -- a not-so-subtle jab at Donald Trump's clothing line. The crowd roared with approval.  ""Ladies and gentlemen, the valedictorian of Trump University!"" Rubio continued as the protester was led out.Rubio's funny, soundbite-heavy, good-for-all-ages shtick couldn't have come too soon, as the presidential race shifts from the retail politics of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to the more mass media-centered national primary campaign. Rubio's funny jabs at Trump -- and they were genuinely funny, not just low-expectations funny -- are the sort of thing he'll need to keep the attention of a media that has been ensorcelled by front-runner Donald Trump's bombast for the last eight months. ""This guy bankrupted a casino,"" Rubio said, not inaccurately. ""How do you bankrupt a casino?""And if Rubio still has a shot at securing his party's nomination -- and it's an increasingly slim one -- he'll have to pick off enough voters from his populist, conservative and establishment opponents to make the race competitive, or at least deprive Trump of enough delegates to force a brokered convention. It's a task that requires such message discipline and political dexterity that sticking the landing would basically make Rubio the Kerri Strug of American politics.That Rubio had already accomplished one practically unheard-of thing -- being a funny Republican -- certainly suggested he might, might be up to the task.His schedule on Monday was a zig-zag through Virginia's politically diverse terrain. Patrick Henry College, a conservative Christian university catering to mostly home-schooled students, presented an opportunity for Rubio to appeal to a right-wing constituency while also addressing more moderate voters from the Washington suburbs.  And while the introductory remarks from Patrick Henry's president, Jack Haye, and former Virginia senator and governor George Allen played to the conservative crowd, employing the faith and ""freedom""-centric rhetoric of the tea party, Rubio's remarks were somewhat more tempered. He stuck mostly to bread-and-butter Republican issues like national security, deregulation and hating on Hillary Clinton, sneaking in a couple of references to the Second Amendment for good measure. This sort of stump speech was music to the ears of attendees like Colleen Osinski, of Prince William County, who hoped a reactionary figure like Trump or Texas Senator Ted Cruz wouldn't be the party's nominee. ""I like that he compromised [on immigration],"" said Osinski. ""The way our government works, you need someone who will be willing to be reasonable and compromise.""Osinski was one of a number of less reactionary supporters at the rally who expressed relief that Rubio was finally attacking Trump's record, but insisted she didn't want to see Rubio mirror Trump's adolescent taunts and recriminations.Indeed, Rubio kept most of his Trump broadsides on the level, abandoning the below-the-belt attacks he briefly employed on Friday, when he suggested to a crowd in Dallas that the reality TV star had wet his pants during Thursday's debate in Houston. Instead, he focused on Trump's spotty business record, the murky ethics of Trump University and struck more populist tones by bemoaning immigrant laborers employed in Trump's properties. ""He needs to point out that Trump is hollow,"" said Laura Russo, 51, of Ashburn. ""He needs to not just make insults like making fun of his spray tan or his hair -- he needs to get to the root of why Trump is not qualified. I'm from New Jersey; I've known about Trump since I was young."" ""He had to show that he can stand up and fight and go toe-to-toe with Trump,"" said Lee Lowder, 39, of Waterford, ""and he didn't do that until the last debate. I wouldn't be here if it hadn't been for the last debate.""Rubio continued that tactic in Richmond, the state's capital and a rich source of the establishment voters that he so desperately needs. Trump, Rubio quipped, believed that the ""Nuclear Triad,"" the term for America's air, land and sea nuclear delivery systems, ""is a punk rock band.""But for all of Rubio's newfound energy on the trail, he is falling behind Trump by a considerable margin and recent polling shows it's still very much Trump's race to lose. Concern about the Republican Party's future and its prospects for November were very much on the minds of Rubio's supporters.""I'd be really embarrassed if it were Trump,"" said Colleen Osinski. ""I've actually lost sleep that I might not vote at all if Trump is the nominee."" ""I've never voted Democrat in my life and Trump would drive me to vote for Hillary,"" added Russo. ""I would vote for her over Trump because I believe that Trump would destroy our country.""

The developing drama series -- which is in partnership with Charles King’s MACRO media company -- will take an ""unflinching look at institutionalization"" by examining the development of children living in juvenile facilities.The project will also draw on the personal experiences of the trio, including Coogler's past as a counselor at a juvenile detention facility in San Francisco. During a 2012 interview with Filmmaker Magazine, Coogler shared his thoughts on the relationship between America's justice system and African-American males.""Lots of times people who don’t come in contact with African-American males have power over their lives. These are the people coming up with policy,"" he said. ""These are the people who are called to juries. These are the people who say 'I want to be a cop,' getting a badge and a gun and shooting up these communities. Protecting people who they never really come in contact with. So it’s a really interesting dynamic.""A premiere date and network for ""Minors"" is expected to be announced at a later date. "

21,POLITICS,Clarence Thomas Speaks From Supreme Court Bench For First Time In A Decade,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clarence-thomas-gun-rights_us_56d46b25e4b0871f60ec0c61,He stood up for the Second Amendment in an under-the-radar criminal law case.,2016-02-29,Justice Clarence Thomas spoke up from the bench for the first time in 10 years to stand up for gun rights.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d46e081500002a000b0eb9.jpeg?cache=WXNNOhlj9e&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Justice Clarence Thomas, near the end of a little-noticed hearing involving issues of domestic abuse and the potential loss of gun rights, asked his first question from the Supreme Court bench in 10 years.The morning's first session was nearly over when Ilana Eisenstein, the assistant solicitor general arguing the government's position, asked if any of the justices had any more questions for her. That's when Thomas leaned forward and, in his booming baritone, launched a line of inquiry so far unexplored in the hourlong hearing. ""Can you give me another area [of law] where a misdemeanor violation suspends a constitutional right?"" Thomas asked Eisenstein, who was arguing that a federal ban on gun ownership for people who are convicted of low-level domestic violence offenses at the state level should apply if the offense was committed ""recklessly.""A strange silence fell over the courtroom. For what seemed like five minutes straight, and in the course of no less than 10 questions, Thomas really wanted to get to the bottom of whether the federal gun prohibition for domestic violence violators -- known as the Lautenberg Amendment -- infringed on a fundamental right.He wanted to know ""how long"" the suspension of Second Amendment rights was for people prohibited under federal law to possess firearms, and he pressed Eisenstein to name any other legal analog where the federal government could permanently curtail constitutional rights following a conviction for an unrelated offense.""Let's say that a publisher is reckless about the use of children, and what could be considered indecent displays and that that triggers a violation of, say, a hypothetical law against the use of children in these ads,"" he said.After that setup, he asked: ""Could you suspend that publisher's right to ever publish again?""The case, Voisine v. United States, didn't arrive at the Supreme Court as a Second Amendment case; the issue was only secondary to the case and no other justice addressed it. But Thomas, a staunch defender of the right to bear arms, seemed interested in the implications for gun owners who otherwise may be stuck with long-term consequences as the result of a domestic violence incident.""Did the defendant use a weapon?"" Thomas asked, appearing to worry whether suspending someone's right to own a gun indefinitely when the offense ""is not directly related"" to the suspension violates the Constitution.Thomas is known for not speaking during Supreme Court oral arguments -- a practice for which he has offered various rationales over the years.Some have argued that Thomas broke his apparent vow of silence in 2013, when he seemed to crack a joke under his breath about Ivy League schools. But that hardly counted as active questioning during oral arguments.If anything, Thomas' questions on Monday could be read as a sign that he misses his late colleague Antonin Scalia -- whose empty seat, ceremonially draped in black, is directly next to his.The last time the Supreme Court declined to review a case involving the Second Amendment -- an assault weapons ban out of Illinois -- both Thomas and Scalia dissented together.Justice Stephen Breyer, as if attempting to respond to Thomas' concerns, suggested that there was no need to decide now a ""major question"" of constitutional law -- that the court was only called on to determine ""what Congress intended"" with the federal gun ban for certain domestic violence perpetrators.But if the issue arose again in a future case, Breyer said, then the court might then have to step in. ""We don't have to decide that here,"" he said."
