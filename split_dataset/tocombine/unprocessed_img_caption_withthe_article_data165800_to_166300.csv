This can only be done by strengthening research and innovation throughout the EU.",2013-01-20,"First year medical students get ready to pass their first semester examination on December 11, 2012 at Marseille's medical university of La Timone. AFP PHOTO / ANNE-CHRISTINE POUJOULAT (Photo credit should read ANNE-CHRISTINE POUJOULAT/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e49d2500009400389234.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The European debt and banking crises have had a devastating impact on youth unemployment across the region. Millions of young people today face the prospect of becoming a lost generation living through a lost decade, and many worry that they have no future. Their trajectory, in contrast to that of their parents and grandparents, is defined not by hope, but fear.The media report that Europe's youth unemployment figure of over 22 percent makes it one of the worst regions in the world. The International Labour Organization has warned that the Eurozone risks losing a further 4.5 million jobs over the next four years, primarily among young people, unless it shifts its policies towards job creation.But despite the frightening speed at which young people have been expelled from the labour market, it is important to note that Europe has coped with high youth unemployment for many years. For example, Spain's youth unemployment figures were similarly high in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, research shows.And unemployment estimates can be deeply misleading. Reports that youth unemployment in Spain and Greece is nearing 50 percent make the situation seem far worse that it is. This is because young people who attend university or vocational training programmes are not considered part of the labor force. So the 50 percent figure does not refer to all young people, just thoseactively looking for a job.A far better indicator is the youth unemployment ratio, which measures the number of unemployed against the total number of young people aged 16 to 24. These figures, while still serious, seem far less doom-laden. For example, the youth unemployment rate for the 27 countries of the European Union has risen from 20.1 percent to over 22 percent since 2009, while the youth unemployment ratio has risen from 8.7 percent to over 9 percent. Greece's youth unemployment rate may be approaching 50 percent, but its youth unemployment ratio is 13 percent. This is not to make light of the situation, but it is important not to be alarmist. And some research suggests that Europe's youth unemployment level is actually better on average than it is in the US.Mitigating these figures somewhat is the ""boomerang"" phenomenon -- young people aged 25 to 34 who left home only to return to live with their parents for economic reasons. This is a widely accepted custom for unmarried children in southern Europe. Roughly 70 percent of Italian men aged 25 to 34 live with their mothers, for example.But there is no getting away from the fact that unemployment has a very negative and even devastating effect on the lifetime earnings and career paths of young people. This is known as the ""scarring effect"" in economic jargon.So what can be done? Here are a few suggestions from a World Economic Forum and ManpowerGroup report:· Higher participation in career guidance programmes for school children· Better career and labour market information for young job seekers· A more positive image for vocational education· Better training· Investment in entrepreneurship education One of the reasons why Germany has a youth unemployment ratio of just 4.5 percent is its relentless focus on training and vocational education. Talent is a by-product of education; the quality of a country's human capital depends on it. Four of the 12 pillars that determine the World Economic Forum's measure of competitiveness relate directly to education: health and primary education; higher education and training; technological readiness; and innovation.If we want to create more jobs, Europe has to invest heavily in the growth sectors of the future, be they genetics, nanotechnology or digitalization. This can only be done by strengthening research and innovation throughout the EU.Technology is going to revolutionize almost every sector, leading to the demise of many traditional professions. Economic and political power will be determined less by a country's size than by its technological superiority. To benefit from this new reality we need to foster a culture of entrepreneurship throughout Europe, investing in innovation hubs for example. Young people will have to realize that jobs will no longer be handed to them on a plate; they will have to create them for themselves. This post is part of a series by Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, based on his book The Re-emergence of Europe."

Krugman, responding to a column by Joseph Stiglitz arguing that inequality is slowing the economic recovery, wrote that he “can’t see how this works.” Though Krugman describes Stiglitz as “an insanely great economist,” he says, he’s not convinced “this particular morality tale is right.” “I wish I could sign on to this thesis, and I’d be politically very comfortable if I could,” Krugman wrote in a blog post Sunday. “But I can’t see how this works.” Stiglitz points to four reasons why inequality is slowing economic growth: America’s middle class is too weak to support the kind of consumer spending required for a robust recovery, the middle class is too weak to invest in its future, the weak middle class means a smaller tax base and income inequality causes more intense boom and bust cycles. Krugman argues in his blog post that while many of those factors played a role in causing financial crisis, they’ve been less of a cause of slowing growth in its aftermath. Since 1960, income inequality has jumped more in the U.S. than in any other major Western country, according to a November analysis from noted economics professors. In the U.S., the top one percent’s share of total income spiked 9 percent during that period, while it declined in some European countries. Stiglitz isn’t the first to argue that income inequality stymies economic growth. A 2011 report from the International Monetary Fund found that a 10 percent decline in income inequality could boost the duration of a period of economic growth by 50 percent. And though Krugman doesn’t buy Stiglitz’s particular rationale in this case, he has argued in the past that “inequality is a major reason the economy is still so depressed.”  "

Yeah [laughs], it's",2013-01-20,"Cast member Matthew McConaughey poses at the premiere of ""Mud"" during the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on Saturday, Jan. 19, 2013 in Park City, Utah. (Photo by Danny Moloshok/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb41303220000bb01dc0247.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The ""McConaissance"" -- a word coined to describe the recent renaissance, if you will, of Matthew McConaughey's career -- has officially now steamrolled into Park City, Utah. The actor, who starred in four wildly different films last year (""Magic Mike,"" ""The Paperboy,"" ""Bernie"" and ""Killer Joe"") is at the Sundance Film Festival with new film, ""Mud,"" which has already garnered some serious buzz. McConaughey and I met on the roof-deck of a Park City restaurant. When you first meet Matthew McConaughey, he is both cordial and charming. When he speaks to you, he leans in and looks you dead in the eye. McConaughey, with a tight haircut -- and looking healthy again after losing a considerable amount of weight for his upcoming film, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" -- is not the type to offer bullshit. He's keenly self-aware of what you think of some of his romantic comedies and is not about to offer any sort of ham-fisted apology for them; as he told me the last time we spoke, those films provide ""mailbox money.""In ""Mud,"" director Jeff Nichols' follow-up to the brilliant ""Take Shelter,"" McConaughey plays the title character, a fugitive who murdered his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend. After befriending two young boys, Mud devises a plan to escape to the Gulf Mexico with the love of his life (played by Reese Witherspoon). I spoke to McConaughey by phone about a month ago after he won a best supporting actor award from the New York Film Critics Circle. In that conversation, we looked back on the brilliant year that McConaughey had; here, we pick up where we left off and look ahead to what might be an even better year (in addition to ""Mud"" and ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" McConaughey also co-stars in Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street""). Just don't expect him to ever give up his now-iconic catchphrase, ""all right, all right, all right."" Last time we spoke, we discussed the McConaissance. I've seen it. It showed up other places.It should. It's a great word. It's the ""sance"" part of it that sounds so cool. It's got a good meter, doesn't it?When you mentioned that, my first reaction was that it was so much better than ""The Year of McConaughey."" Yeah [laughs], it's got a little more of a zoom to it.I've decided, though, that this year is the Year of McConaughey, not last year. Because last year just set the scene that you're doing these good movies Right, right, right ...And now we're used to that. I mean, ""Mud"" premiered at Cannes last year, but it didn't get a lot of buzz until now. Do you think that's because people are now thinking of you differently? Ah ... well, it doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Because ""Mud"" doesn't feel like a ""knock, knock, knock, can I come in?"" It feels like we're all in the room. But why is the buzz hitting now? Well, we're coming out in April, so obviously there's a machine that kind of gears up. And the fact that I had a successful last year sure as heck doesn't hurt it. It helps the film, for sure. It doesn't make it like a, ""What?"" or a, ""Oh, that's novel."" It's coming on the back of some work that I've done that people have liked and they go, ""That's different and we liked it."" Do you know what I mean? [McConaughey makes a trumpet-sounding noise].How do I transcribe that noise? [Makes the trumpet sound again] That's the opening music to the McConaissance. That's the ""sance"" in the ""McCon.""From now on when you're introduced, that should play. So I've got to go, ""All right, all right, all right"" ...You don't do that one anymore -- we're moving on to your new theme. I can't give that one up though, man. Those were the first words that I ever said on film. [Trumpet sound] That's the ""sance"" in the ""McCon."" There were some sort of satellite views on ""Mud"" from Cannes, but Cannes still felt like it was ""over there."" And now people are seeing it -- and I'm interested to see what happens. So far, it seems like there's been a lot of positive reaction to it for very specific reasons, which is cool. And I sure hope it gets ink because I'm endeared to this movie. It's got an innocence and, oh, it takes me back in a wonderful way. For some reason from the description I thought it was going to be a comedy. I think it's because Mud is referred to as an ""outlaw,"" so I got ""cowboy"" in my head. Oh, you wrote that he's more of a fugitive.I think that's the better description. Outlaw sounds like there are more guns blaring and he's much more of an aristocrat of the heart. And, yeah, he did kill a man -- for one reason. Really, the only reason he kind of would: over the love of a woman that has kicked him off the porch a thousand times. And he ain't countin' and he don't care. And there's also more mystery. I love the mysterious aspect; the superstitions. It's not an aggressive movie.I feel like you and Jeff Nichols are a good team. It is a good team. I hear you. I love working with Nichols because, look, he wrote this thing. And we didn't change hardly a word. Didn't need to. I mean, I had things I'd go off on, but it was just to really help me understand and explain the actual text that he wrote -- which was always better. It's simple working with Jeff. This movie is very representative of who he is -- he's a really decent man. And confident enough to not insert himself when something is going well, you know? But, specific enough to go, ""it needs to be this and this."" Also, confident enough to go, ""That's it, we got it."" Let's move on, basically. A lot of directors who are younger will go, ""OK, we've got that, how else can we do it?""I feel bad because last time we spoke I may have been a little hard on ""Fool's Gold."" I mean, I do get your point about what you said about ""mailbox money"" and ""90 days of Saturdays."" Yeah, that's the Saturday characters, those are ...But I didn't mean to pick on ""Fool's Gold."" I don't give a shit if you pick on it. I don't care. I don't care of you don't like me in a film. I don't give a shit -- we can still sit here and talk about it. I mean, thank God people have different tastes. But it is Saturday. Something like ""Fool's Gold,"" something about romantic comedies -- they're built not to grab a hold. You can't have a character obsessed 100 percent. Mud is obsessed. You can grab a hold of that. it's not about coming back to the center because we've got to hit a plot point. All of the characters I've been doing lately, they're obsessed about something. And I've been able to get feverishly drunk on their obsessions. Now, you can't get feverishly obsessed in a romantic comedy. They're built not to do that. The movie that I think was the transition from a movie like ""Fool's Gold"" and where you're at now is ""Lincoln Lawyer."" I think that movie started the McConaissance.  I think you're right.It caught people off guard. Well, what people did is -- and this is the objective awareness I'm throwing at you now -- what happened there, people went, ""I like that thriller ... yeah, 'A Time To Kill,' man!"" They flash-backed a little.So a callback to your '90s work? A callback ... so it switched that view on me a little bit. They didn't go, ""Oh, it's brand new."" It called them back a little, is what I felt. It called them back and they say, ""That's right, he's good in that type of movie.""Was that the plan with ""Lincoln Lawyer"" from the start? Well, I knew it had some of those aspects -- the drama and the thriller aspects. But I didn't know. I figured if it worked and people saw it and liked it, that they would go, ""Oh yeah, we haven't seen him in something like that before."" Because it had it in the script -- it could pop enough to be something that goes around and makes $50 million, or whatever it made. You know? And we didn't make it for that much. But I also thought it had enough solid drama in it, so it could balance that. It's not a serious film, but it's about some pretty serious shit. And it was a fun thriller. I love getting manipulated in that film, as viewer. And a good thriller, that's what it does: it manipulates.You've done serious movies in the past, but something about the movies you're doing now feels different than doing a movie like ""Amistad."" These feel like real risks where ""Amistad"" had ""big awards movie"" written all over it. Does that makes sense? I think in a way it does. Not only are in the roles I'm choosing are the guys outsiders, the whole subject matter is coming from the side. It's not coming in straight. They're coming in off the exit, getting on the autobahn. They're not on the autobahn taking the exit. When they're working, they're coming in -- ""Killer Joe"" came in like a lightning bolt. People knew what they were getting with ""Amistad."" Yeah, that's packaged as ... Spielberg, slavery, the middle passage. So, it comes packaged with that sort of expectation. You could argue ""Contact"" did with Zemeckis and Jodie Foster. It was packaged as Carl Sagan ...I didn't see that ending coming.  Right. But those were both, in some ways, just as personal for me. Those were subjects that I had written about in college. But, then, here's the other thing -- here's the thing we don't know about: I could have done all five of these and I could have given the exact same performance and we might not be sitting here because maybe some of them didn't see the light of day. The thing is, they all had an identity. Some of them made bigger impacts -- ""Magic Mike"" is a $7 million movie and it makes $100 and a googol. ""Paperboy"" gets seen by a small group of people and it's really split down the middle. ""Bernie,"" the little movie that could -- keeps on just hitting it. ""Killer Joe,"" if you saw it, it left a brand on you. What I'm saying is: there's no guarantee that they get above the waterline. But they did. Because they're independent. That's what's cool with independent, it's just getting them to make it -- you get the friggin' money to go out of of escrow, because now we're making it. Then, after that, guess what? There's no machine behind us. So, we have to go, ""Let's peddle. If it's good, it sits in front of us and all we have to do is speak about it. People talk about it, it gets a buzz and people go, ""I'm going to choose that over this blockbuster."" And then they get a life. I hope it continues. I'm gonna keep goin' to work. I'm lovin' it.Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment. You can contact him directly on Twitter."

Poe, who lived in the city for a time, died on a return visit to Baltimore in 1849 and was interred at Westminster Burial Ground. He was later moved to a more prominent spot in front of the cemetery, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1875.Visitors in town this weekend to check out the famous grave can also head over to the Poe House, where he penned a number of stories and poems, not far away on Amity Street.More contemporary-minded tourists might be more interested in Baltimore's two outstanding fine art museums, its world-class aquarium or its exciting local coffee shop scene."

Author, Blogger, Lawyer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parenting-the-ultimate-fu_us_5b9cbc78e4b03a1dcc81589c,"The problem is this: Whenever I see someone young enough to be my kid in a difficult situation, I tend to imagine my own kid in the same spot.",2013-01-19,"Notre Dame's Manti Te'o (5) reacts after Notre Dame defeated Michigan, 13-6, in an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Sept. 22, 2012, in South Bend, Ind. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbc783c0000320009e091.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Parenting has changed me. I knew this already, of course, but was reminded of it again in the wake of the Manti Te'o story. In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that I love Notre Dame. My dad, my son and I all went there (not in that order). Not surprisingly, we are Notre Dame football fans, a fact that may cause some to question my objectivity on this matter. Fair enough.Notre Dame isn't the only thing I love, though. I also love a good joke. And boy, does the Manti Te'o story involving the fake dead girlfriend offer plenty of material for hilarious parodies and side-splitting punch lines. And in the initial few hours after the story broke, I myself enjoyed a big laugh or two at some of the captioned photos floating around on Facebook. I'm not laughing anymore. Based on what I know today, I find the whole ordeal about as far from funny as you can get. And my role as parent makes it impossible to appreciate any joke that is made at the expense of this college kid.The problem is this: Whenever I see someone young enough to be my kid in a difficult situation, I tend to imagine my own kid in the same spot. This happened last year when law student Sandra Fluke was attacked by Rush Limbaugh for testifying before members of the U.S. House of Representatives about whether health insurance should cover contraceptives. At the time my son and his girlfriend were both in law school and I couldn't help but picture them in the same position. Challenging Fluke's views was fair game, but I was outraged that she was being personally disparaged for something that was objectively commendable -- having the courage to speak before the House at such a young age. And so it is with Manti Te'o. What made Te'o stand out to me wasn't that he was just a phenomenal football player. After all, Notre Dame had plenty of talented players on its team this year. What set Te'o apart were certain key characteristics. One such characteristic was his loyalty -- a quality that I first noticed last year when he elected to return to Notre Dame for his senior year rather than going pro. His loyalty also was evident in areas ranging from his attitude toward family, faith, community, his team, and his school.  In addition to being loyal, Te'o was open, trusting, and supportive. And these qualities were not just byproducts of the twin tragedies of losing his grandmother and his girlfriend on the same day. (One turned out to be a hoax; but the other, it's important to remember, was very real.) These genuine qualities were on display as we watched him encounter personal adversity and then transcend it. His teammates rallied around to support him, but in the end it was Te'o that lifted everyone else up. These were the qualities that made me admire him. But sadly, these were also the qualities that made it easy to exploit him by the perpetrators of this hoax.  I've mentioned my twenty-something year old son, but I also have a middle school-aged daughter. So, in addition to considering things from Te'o's point of view, my parenting responsibilities require me to model for Hannah how to respond when someone has been humiliated by a cruel ""joke.""  It is tempting to join the chorus of those laughing at him. After all, everyone who loved Te'o feels a little duped right now. And making fun of him would make us feel less stupid because it would allow us to be on the side of those dishing out the humiliation rather than receiving it--a really nasty side of human nature. We desperately want to be on the winning team. We want to believe that we would never be so dumb as to fall for that -- and maybe we really wouldn't be.   But what would Hannah learn from that? That once people exploit someone's positive qualities those qualities are no longer admirable? That as soon as someone is made the butt of a cruel joke it's okay to make it a pile-on and further mock him? That anything is fair game as long as it gets a good laugh?Consider this: what if we weren't talking about a famous college football player, but rather just a regular college kid? And what if the college kid were the victim of the same kind of hoax? ""Friends"" recognized his trusting nature and tricked him into thinking he had an online girlfriend. After keeping up the ruse for a long time, they later faked the girlfriend's death and the college kid was devastated by the loss. Would that still be funny?Let's not forget that plenty of kids have committed suicide in the wake of being humiliated in similar ways. And in those instances, we don't make jokes about it and talk about how dumb or gullible the kid was. We shake our heads, we rail on about cyber bullying and mean spiritedness, and we call for legislation to protect kids from this kind of harm in the future. Does our sympathy only kick in if there's a suicide? Is the humiliation alone not enough to make us realize that a college kid was wronged? Does the fact that Te'o was an amazing football player make all of this somehow okay?Pointing to the fact that Te'o first learned something was amiss on December 6th, some say he should have come forward sooner. I remember watching the Heisman Trophy ceremony on December 8th wondering why he didn't seem to be his normal open and personable self. I chalked it up to nerves. But can you for a minute put yourself in this college kid's shoes at that nationally televised awards ceremony? Forty-eight hours earlier he learned that he was punked in the cruelest of ways. His girlfriend was either not dead or never real. Her death -- something that caused him not just to endure unimaginable grief, but to do so in the national spotlight -- was one big trick. And now he stood to become the laughing stock of the entire country. Oh -- and he still had a national championship football game to play in a little over a month -- a game that had significance far beyond him individually. Sure, he answered reporters' questions about his girlfriend after December 6th, but as far as I can tell he wasn't the one bringing her up. And the length and tenor of his answers were noticeably different than they had been before. What else was this college kid supposed to do? I realize we don't yet have all the answers, but based on the information that is currently out there from credible news organizations (whatever that means anymore, given how long it took this story to break), this is what I'm telling Hannah: We admire Manti Te'o because of all of his amazing qualities. These qualities are no less admirable because his ""friends"" exploited them and humiliated him for sport. When people are victimized you don't turn on them, you stand with them. You call out the perpetrators for their behavior rather than blaming the victim. And Manti Te'o, if you're reading, I offer you the same advice I give to people who have been cheated on by their significant others. The key is to learn what you can from the experience without letting it rob you of your positive characteristics. If you're trusting by nature, that's a good thing. But if you're the trusting type that ignores red flags, stop ignoring the red flags. This scandal has raised a lot of questions, but there's one question that it has put to rest--why Te'o performance was as lackluster as it was in the national championship game against Alabama. I will continue to follow this story for as long as it continues to unfold. If I find out that Te'o is not telling the truth (something I don't expect, but I've been wrong before -- I'm looking at you, Bill Clinton), then that would change everything, and Te'o would get grouped together with Lance Armstrong rather than Forest Gump. But as it stands now, my support as well as my respect remain with Manti Te'o."

While good role models should possess qualities that are admirable -- courage, tenacity, kindness, achievement -- they're also meant to be examples for real life. And real people, as we all know, are complicated and flawed. This is one reason many public figures resist the title of role model. (As F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, ""Show me a hero, and I'll write you a tragedy."") Charles Barkley famously said that he's ""not paid to be a role model,"" and didn't want to be looked to as such. ""I'm not going to be everything to everyone,"" singer Katy Perry, who has millions of young fans, has said. ""I can't tell a person when it's time for them to have sex. Or if they should have a cigarette."" Which is why important for parents to talk to kids about what it means to emulate someone, and that it may be appropriate to pick and choose different qualities from different people. Boys in particular often look to sports heroes as role models, and it can be easy to see why: they excel in a way that most boys are familiar with and can understand. But it's key to encourage boys to look to other, perhaps less conventional role models for examples of how they might want to live and grow. To encourage them to understand how the tools someone uses to achieve a goal are often more important than achieving the goal itself. And to embrace more than one idea of what it means to be exceptional. Because when it comes to heroes, a kid can never have too many. Some ideas: Creativity. Alexander Wang. At 28, Wang was named creative director of Balenciaga, one of the most storied fashion houses in history, after more than a decade of hard work, perseverance, and never accepting the notion that he was ""too young."" Versatility. Michael Strahan. He's a former NFL hero, sure. But in his second career as a daytime talk show co-host -- as the funny, down-to-earth sidekick to Kelly Ripa -- Strahan is proof that boys can dream big in more ways than one. Courage. Zach Wahls. At 19, Wahls -- who was raised by two moms, and often bullied for it -- spoke before the Iowa legislature on behalf of gay marriage, as seen in a video that went viral and took his message to millions around the world. He is now one of the country's youngest gay rights activists. Integrity. Anderson Cooper. The Emmy Award-winning journalist, known for reporting from some of the most dangerous places in the world, announced he's gay with an openness and honesty -- but not before he was ready. Self-confidence. Rico Rodriguez. The 14-year-old Modern Family star doesn't look like most teen heartthrobs, and he's perfectly okay with that, as he writes in his book, Reel Life Lessons... So Far.Conviction. Barack Obama. Regardless of your politics, Obama -- raised by a single mom to become a Nobel Peace Prize winner and two-term U.S. president -- has helped encourage a world less divided by race. Humility. Usain Bolt. Widely regarded as the world's fastest man, Jamaican-born Bolt is well known as a guy who doesn't take himself too seriously. But when the time comes to work, he works. ""No matter how good you are,"" he's said, ""there is always room for improvement."" Big heartedness. Charlie Simpson. At 7, Simpson decided he'd bike around his neighborhood park to raise money for victims of the earthquake in Haiti. His initiative so inspired his community that the donations flooded in -- and eventually totaled more than $240,000. Tenacity. Christopher Paolini. The author of the best-selling Eragon series began writing when he was 15. But he wasn't just born inspired: He spent three years writing the first draft. Equanimity. Katniss Everdeen. The ultimate underdog hero, the star of the Hunger Games series is selfless, values kindness and hard work, and never backs down. And because role models for boys needn't be exclusively male."

King said the march was 'the greatest demonstration of freedom in the history of the United States.' Martin Luther King was assassinated on 04 April 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray confessed to shooting King and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. King's killing sent shock waves through American society at the time, and is still regarded as a landmark event in recent US history. (Photo credit should read AFP/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badd2dc2600003300810b95.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most overlooked aspects of Martin Luther King's legacy is his work around economic justice and poverty. Though the landmark rally in 1963 during which King delivered his ""I Have A Dream"" speech is now widely known as ""The March on Washington,"" the complete title of that event was ""The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom."" In fact, in the last year of his life, Dr. King was organizing the Poor People's Campaign, a multiracial effort to alleviate poverty and provide guaranteed income for every citizen. King understood that without greater economic equality, racial disparities and divisions could not be overcome.  In 1967, Dr. King wrote the foreword for the Freedom Budget  -- a far-reaching and ambitious social proposal created by economist Leon Keyserling and March on Washington organizer Bayard Rustin. It involved massive investments in public works and infrastructure, training programs that would upgrade skills and education, employment opportunity expansion, affordable public health services, and raising the minimum wage to two dollars an hour -- an amount equivalent to $13.79 in buying power today, though our federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour.   The Freedom Budget, along with many of the economic goals of the civil rights movement, never came to pass, leaving a racial economic chasm that persists to this day. Today the Freedom Budget remains startlingly relevant, emphasizing issues such as job creation, living wages, access to better health care, and wealth redistribution -- relevant and urgent problems that still impair our country.  In remembering Dr. King and the legacy of the Black Freedom movement for which he gave his life, too often we revise history and speak as though the racism and white supremacy he fought against are now problems of the past. The truth is since Dr. King's time, the Black unemployment rate has remained twice that of whites, and in the last three decades, racial wealth inequality has ballooned out of control. To truly honor Dr. King, we must remember that he died on the battlefield fighting for an agenda, which to this day remains unrealized. Dr. King's dream of racial equality is still a dream that requires ongoing struggle to make a reality.   Dr. King and the movement he represents offer us many valuable lessons, both as a country and as individuals. A core principle of the 1967 Freedom Budget holds that smart investments that spur economic growth are the best way forward for a weak economy. This also holds true for our own personal economy. For a young adult out of high school, or an unemployed worker forced to undergo a career change, it may be tempting to keep treading water and avoid risk -- but it is often precisely during these times of personal economic uncertainty that we should invest in higher education or job certification programs that will, over the long run, allow us to bring in more income and gain economic stability.  During Dr. King's famed speech at the March on Washington for Freedom and Jobs, he stated, ""We refuse to believe there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation."" One of the great economic lessons Dr. King has for us all is this: The road to prosperity requires of us faith, struggle, sacrifice, and investment, particularly for the most vulnerable. On Martin Luther King's birthday, let us commit ourselves to Dr. King's economic principles.American Money is a weekly column written by Dedrick Muhammad, the senior director of the NAACP Economic Programs.

Let it grow out for BeachBear Weekend in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Meet up with furry friends May 8 to 13. Bring a comb, because you're sure to get plenty of sand stuck in your mane.7. Go for a different kind of Pride in Brooklyn. As it does most things, the borough puts its own distinct spin on Pride this June 8. The more laid-back, neighborly vibe is a nice departure from the norm. Plus, I love any chance to belt out Alicia Keys' part of ""Empire State of Mind.""8. Sniff out the next Tina Fey and Amy Poehler at The Second City in Chicago. The funny duo got their starts as part of this renowned improv troupe. You could be the third in their cynical yet witty trio! And then you could go to the Golden Globes! And meet Bradley or Jodie, depending on your preference! Ahh...9. Don't be shy during Bone Island Bare It All weekend in Key West, Fla. From July 10 to 14, beach goers let it all hang out (ha!). Bring extra sunscreen, because burns on your special parts could really ruin the trip.10. Get in tip-top shape for the Mr. Gay Ogunquit Speedo Pageant in Ogunquit, Maine. No pressure. There will just be hundreds of people staring. Actually, it's probably more enjoyable to be one of those people. Either way, be there on Labor Day.11. Evoke old Hollywood at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pa. The newly renovated 1939 theater counts Grace and Liza among its past talent. Maybe you'll catch the next Bea Arthur onstage for Mame, its kickoff to the season. 12. Watch some drag volleyball in Rehoboth Beach, Del. The spectacle takes place Labor Day, but you can work on your overhand any day of the summer at Rehoboth's Poodle Beach. Wear whatever you'd like.13. Spend a hot night at WaterFire, a beautiful art installation along the three rivers of downtown Providence, R.I.

The influence Livestrong has had on making lives better is undeniable, with the cancer community forever indebted to them for their contributions. However, what Lance Armstrong has taught us is that it's important not to glamorize cause-based initiatives without further consideration of motives.Employees of non-profits do make a living on their salary and to many it is simply a job. Working for a charity doesn't make you a philanthropist. Some people are in it for the cause and some a paycheck. Most for both. It doesn't quite matter as long as everyone performs the work, which leads to fulfilling a worthwhile mission. In fact, there is only one person that needs to be 100 percent in it for the cause. That is, the founder. The head of any charitable organization should firmly stand for the advancement of humanity over self.Sadly, Lance Armstrong has always been in it for himself. Contrary to those more hopeful, I fully believe that founding the Livestrong organization was just another masked tool for feeding his ego and hiding his ugliness. The mess he created with cowardly lies is worse than a pair of stained bike shorts.In defense of Livestrong, Lance's motive doesn't change the amazing impact the organization has made and will continue to make through the sweat and dedication of a staff of likely good intentioned employees. For those people and the fact that the organization provided me with valuable support during my own cancer experience, I will always back their mission. As Livestrong stated, in their own press release response to Lance's confession, I too believe that ""the mission is bigger than any one person."" And while it is a bit hard to swallow that the platform for such positivity was built on deception, Lance's confession to doping doesn't change the positive effect Livestrong has had on millions of patients and their families.Unfortunately, after the confession, I must take issue with those who continue to argue that Lance Armstrong built Livestrong with any universally good intentions. Considering he spent his life letting countless others look foolish in order to maintain his own glorified image, it is hard to fathom that Livestrong was anything but another byproduct (albeit a positive one) of obsessive pride.This shouldn't come as a shock. Evidence shows that his character has always pointed to self-absorption and personal validation above all else. That's why he wrote autobiographical books, dated a rock star and became best friends with a celebrity actor. Whether he wants to admit it or not, it is also why he had to have the best cancer organization in the country. Lance Armstrong needs to win regardless of cost. He cares for no one else. Eventually many felt it would ruin him and now with one half-ass confession, it has. Instead of a legacy, Lance will go quietly with his tail tucked; his best achievement being that he provided us a nice lesson in humility. The only gratitude I will ever express to Lance is for his charitable donation of how not to live your life. Hell, I'd even wear the bracelet."

(AP Photo/CBS News, Chris Usher)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e510260000e90081f88a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Look, I know what you are thinking. Every day, it seems, comes news of another mortgage lawsuit or settlement, including a foreclosure abuse deal between HSBC and federal regulators announced Friday. It's hard to keep them all straight. Frankly, if you didn't lose your home to foreclosure, or come close to doing so, you might not know what to think. Maybe you manage to muster some vague feeling of irritation about the behavior of U.S. financial institutions, but mentally you're already trying to place that overvalued ""Z"" in your Scrabulous game. But what happened, and is happening now, might affect you more than you think. Here are three takeaways from the crisis that should matter to far more than the 8 million or so U.S. households that received a foreclosure notice.1. Had the federal government acted decisively at the outset, your home would probably be worth more than it is now.Rising home prices over the last year have finally revived the housing market, pulling millions of underwater borrowers up from the sea. This is fantastic news for some people who clung to their homes, and kept making mortgage payments, as prices collapsed. But millions more, who bought in places like San Bernardino, Calif. or Brockton, Mass., still owe more than twice what their homes are now actually worth. These borrowers are far more likely to lose their homes to foreclosure, a process that damages neighborhoods and holds down home values across the board. Offering some form of principal reduction, or debt relief, to these borrowers from the outset would have saved homes and likely shortened the housing crisis. Yet in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said government-sponsored debt relief wasn't possible, or fair.And you know, I like explain to people that we didn't have $500 billion or three-quarters of a trillion dollars to provide principal reduction to the American homeowner, and doing so would have been a very inefficient way to help the economy, and really unfair in many ways. But Congress did give Geithner a $45 billion check to help homeowners as part of the TARP bank-bailout fund. About 90 percent of that money went unspent. Housing groups, and analyses by both Treasury and the Federal Housing Finance Administration, determined that a principal reduction program targeted to those it was most likely to help would both limit foreclosures and save taxpayer money. Geithner, though, was never really on board, falling back again and again on the ""moral hazard"" argument -- that bailing out some homeowners and not others wasn't just, and could encourage people to intentionally default. Geithner briefly changed his tune on principal reduction, and went so far as to chastise Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the FHFA, for refusing to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to write down loans as part of the $25 billion settlement between banks and the states last March. But his recent comments suggest his true position never wavered much. 2. Buying a new home loan is more difficult than it should be.  In the run-up to the housing crisis, millions of borrowers who had no business buying a home did so. Now, millions of would-be buyers who could afford a reasonably-priced home are locked out of favorable interest rates. There are lots of reasons for this, including a reticence by mortgage bankers to lend money without first securing a first-born child as collateral. But the most significant factor is the reluctance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy any but the most gold-plated mortgage, a development that marks a significant retreat from the original purpose of the government-controlled mortgage behemoths, which was to provide middle America a broad path to the housing market. DeMarco, who has run the agency as acting director for two years, has defended this position as looking out for the best interests of taxpayers who spent more than $180 billion to bail out the companies. Obama could put forward a nominee to replace DeMarco at the top of the FHFA, or potentially even fire him, but despite persistent rumors about his imminent departure, DeMarco has held onto his job.3. The bank regulators have decided that helping homeowners is just too hard.There's plenty to say about what the recently-announced $8.5 billion foreclosure abuse settlement means for homeowners who applied for relief to the review process that it replaces: good news for people who didn't deserve a dime and probably bad news for those who lost their home because of massive bank errors (and yes, Wall Street Journal editorial board, as dozens of reporters have documented, this definitely happened). The deal is also a boon to the banks, which are no longer on the hook for an open-ended liability and get a tax break on what they pay out, to boot. But for the rest of us, the takeaway is this: bank regulators simply can't be trusted to clean up the mess from a banking crisis. They failed to make sure that the mortgage companies were dealing fairly with homeowners struggling to make payments and then failed to oversee a review process meant to determine what, exactly, had gone wrong. The upshot now is that we will never really know how many homes could have been saved from foreclosure had banks followed the rules. The best hope, then, is to prevent future crises. Which is reason to pay close attention to whether the financial sector is able to curb the parts of the Dodd-Frank law most likely to stop all this from happening again. How's that going? Two-and-a-half years, and $200 million in financial industry lobbying expenditures later, more than half of the required rules still haven't been written."

""My understanding was that (New York Fed) President Geithner had discussed a reduction in the discount rate with these banks in connection with these initiatives.""According to transcripts of the call released by the Fed on Friday, Geithner at the time denied that banks knew the Fed was considering cutting the discount rate. The Fed regularly releases transcripts of its policy meetings with a five-year lag.""We don't have any comment beyond the transcript,"" said Treasury spokesman Anthony Coley. The Treasury declined to make Geithner available to comment.Information about any planned interest rate move by the Fed is among the most sensitive as it can have a huge impact on a range of financial markets worldwide. That was particularly the case in the summer of 2007 when there were growing concerns about financial stability as a crisis that would reach fever pitch just more than a year later began to build.Private disclosure of confidential, market-sensitive information by the central bank would be highly unusual, but it was not immediately clear if it would be illegal. It also was not clear if strict Fed internal rules governing confidential information would have been breached, or whether any internal or external investigation was mounted. Lacker made no suggestion of wrongdoing by the banks as a result of getting hold of any information.The central bank delivered a surprise cut in the discount rate, which governs direct loans it makes to banks, the day after the call. The action spurred a big stock market rally, with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index enjoying its best gain in 4-1/2 years.In his statement to Reuters, Lacker did not say which banks may have been privy to the information, although in the transcript of the Aug. 16, 2007, call he said he had discussed the matter with Bank of America's then CEO, Ken Lewis, earlier that day. The Richmond Fed supervises the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank.Spokesmen for the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, the New York Fed and Bank of America all declined to comment, as did Lewis. FIRST IN SERIES OF RATE CUTSThe unusually large half-point cut in the discount rate to 5.75 percent that the Fed delivered on Aug. 17 was the first in a long series and came just days after French bank BNP Paribas froze three investment funds that were facing heavy redemptions. A month later, the Fed would also cut the overnight federal funds rate, its primary lever to influence the economy.During the Fed's Aug. 16, 2007, conference call, Geithner said that banks had started to ask about borrowing from the Fed earlier in the month after the central bank had released a statement saying it stood ready to provide liquidity to credit markets.Geithner said banks ""obviously don't have any idea that we're contemplating a change in policy"" - a statement that Lacker then questioned.""Did you say that they are unaware of what we're considering or what we might be doing with the discount rate?"" Lacker asked, according to the transcript.Geithner said yes, and Lacker followed up: ""I spoke with Ken Lewis, president and CEO of Bank of America, this afternoon, and he said that he appreciated what Tim Geithner was arranging by way of changes in the discount facility. So my information is different from that.""Geithner responded, ""I cannot speak for Ken Lewis, but I think they have sought to see whether they could understand a little more clearly the scope of their rights and our current policy with respect to the (discount lending) window.""""The only thing I've done is to try to help them understand ... what the scope of that is,"" he said.Geithner, who is stepping down from his Treasury post next Friday, was an advocate of aggressive action to stem the crisis, and the steps the central bank took are widely credited with helping to calm the financial storm. Lacker was less inclined to intervene in the markets."

On Jan. 15, dozens of activists and gun violence survivors gathered for a rally at a Walmart store in Danbury, Conn., and delivered four petitions. With a total of more than 300,000 signatures, the petitions called for the world's largest retailer to stop selling and advertising assault weapons in stores. ""Walmart is making it easy and appealing to purchase an assault weapon. Assault weapons cause mass murder and should be left for law enforcement and military. Civilians do not need to have any assault weapons in their homes,"" writes one Change.org petition. ""Advertising is something that creates wants and needs. To create a want for such a weapon only promotes violence."" More than 113,000 people have signed the Change.org petition so far. According to a Friday news release, thousands more have stepped forward in the past few days to demand that Walmart pull assault weapons and ammunition from its shelves.

He added that assault weapons are sold only at ""locations with a high concentration of hunters and sportsmen."" After the Sandy Hook tragedy, Walmart reportedly pulled the Bushmaster Patrolman's Carbine M4A3 Rifle from its website. The Bushmaster rifle, a military-style assault weapon, was one of the guns used by the Newtown school shooter. But Walmart is said to sell ""more firearms and ammunition than any national competitor,"" and the retailer has continued to stock its shelves with other assault weapons.A representative for Walmart declined to comment to HuffPost.The National Rifle Association (NRA), the country's largest gun rights group, has long been a vocal opponent of most gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons. In December, the NRA responded to the Sandy Hook tragedy by suggesting that all schools in the U.S. should have armed guards. ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" said NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre during the group's post-Sandy Hook press conference.Reactions to the NRA's position have been mixed. Though many were critical of the gun lobby's response, the group has reportedly welcomed more than 250,000 new members since the Newtown shooting.""[Walmart should] stand up to the NRA and listen to their customers and stop selling these guns,"" Kaytee Riek, campaign manager at SumofUs, which organized one of the four petitions delivered to Walmart, told The Huffington Post earlier this week.

14,TECH,"Kim Dotcom: New Mega Site Is Legal, Not Revenge For Megaupload Saga","Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-dotcom-new-mega-site_us_5bb35fdbe4b0fa920b973315,Dotcom was coy about the details of the launch party as builders put the finishing touches to a festival-sized concert stage,2013-01-19,"AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND - FEBRUARY 22: Kim Dotcom briefly speaks to media after being released on bail at North Shore District Court on February 22, 2012 in Auckland, New Zealand. The megaupload.com founder, and four associates were arrested last month accused of internet piracy by US authorities. (Photo by Sandra Mu/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb35fdb250000320038b7dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kim Dotcom, founder of outlawed file-sharing website Megaupload, said his new ""cyberlocker"" was not revenge on U.S. authorities who planned a raid on his home, closed Megaupload and charged him with online piracy for which he faces jail if found guilty.Dotcom said his new offering, Mega.co.nz, which will launch on Sunday even as he and three colleagues await extradition from New Zealand to the United States, complied with the law and warned that attempts to take it down would be futile.""This is not some kind of finger to the U.S. government or to Hollywood,"" Dotcom told Reuters at his sprawling estate in the bucolic hills of Coatesville, just outside Auckland, New Zealand, a country known more for sheep, rugby and the Hobbit than flamboyant tech tycoons.""Legally, there's just nothing there that could be used to shut us down. This site is just as legitimate and has the right to exist as Dropbox, Boxnet and other competitors,"" he said, referring to other popular cloud storage services.His lawyer, Ira Rothken, added that launching the site was compliant with the terms of Dotcom's bail conditions. U.S. prosecutors argue that Dotcom in a statement said he had no intention of starting a new internet business until his extradition was resolved.CODES AND KEYSDotcom said Mega was a different beast to Megaupload, as the new site enables users to control exactly which users can access uploaded files, in contrast to its predecessor, which allowed users to search files, some of which contained copyrighted content allegedly without permission.A sophisticated encryption system will allow users to encode their files before they upload them on to the site's servers, which Dotcom said were located in New Zealand and overseas.Each file will then be issued a unique, sophisticated decryption key which only the file holder will control, allowing them to share the file as they choose.As a result, the site's operators would have no access to the files, which they say would strip them from any possible liability for knowingly enabling users to distribute copyright-infringing content, which Washington says is illegal.""Even if we wanted to, we can't go into your file and snoop and see what you have in there,"" the burly Dotcom said.Dotcom said Mega would comply with orders from copyright holders to remove infringing material, which will afford it the ""safe harbor"" legal provision, which minimizes liability on the condition that a party acted in good faith to comply.But some legal experts say it may be difficult to claim the protection if they do not know what users have stored.The Motion Pictures Association of America said encrypting files alone would not protect Dotcom from liability.""We'll reserve final judgment until we have a chance to analyze the new project,"" a spokesman told Reuters. ""But given Kim Dotcom's history, count us as skeptical.""The German national, who also goes by Kim Schmitz, expects huge interest in its first month of operation, which would be a far cry from when Megaupload went live in 2005.""I would be surprised if we had less than one million users,"" Dotcom said.A YEAR ONMega's launch starts the next chapter of the Dotcom narrative, dotted with previous cyber crime-related arrests and whose twists and turns have been scrutinized by all facets of the entertainment industry, from film studios and record labels to internet service companies and teenage gamers.The copyright infringement case, billed as the largest to date given that Megaupload in its heyday commanded around four percent of global online traffic, could set a precedent for internet liability laws and depending on its outcome, may force entertainment companies to rethink their distribution methods.A year on, the extradition hearing has been delayed until August, complicated by illegal arrest warrants and the New Zealand government's admission that it had illegally spied on Dotcom, who has residency status in the country.Last January, New Zealand's elite special tactics forces landed by helicopter at dawn in the grounds of Dotcom's mansion, worth roughly NZ$30 million ($25.05 million) and featuring a servants' wing, hedge maze and life-size statues of giraffes and a rhinoceros, to arrest him and his colleagues at the request of the FBI.Police armed with semi-automatic weapons found Dotcom cowering alone in a panic room in the attic, while outside, a convoy of police cars and vans pulled up in the driveway. Around 70 officers took part in the raid.They left with computers, files and some of Dotcom's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Mercedes and a vintage pink Cadillac tricked with personalized license plates screaming ""HACKER"", ""EVIL"", and ""MAFIA"".""Every time you hear a helicopter, you automatically think, 'Oh, another raid', so it's something that stays with you for a long time,"" said Dotcom, who says he and his wife still panic when they hear sudden, loud noises in the house.Dotcom was coy about the details of the launch party as builders put the finishing touches to a festival-sized concert stage in the mansion's grounds, while two helicopters circled overhead.But if the impromptu, Willy Wonka-styled ice cream social he threw in Auckland earlier in the week is any indication, the party could be a more wholesome affair compared with the well-documented soirees of Dotcom's past, where nightclubs, hot tubs and scantily clad women were a common fixture.""I had to grow up, you know, I was a big baby,"" he said. ""Big baby with too much money usually leads to baby craziness.""I am going to be more of a person that wants to help to make things better and help internet innovation to take off without all these restrictions by governments. That is going to be my primary goal if this business is successful.""(Editing by Daniel Magnowski and Nick Macfie)"
