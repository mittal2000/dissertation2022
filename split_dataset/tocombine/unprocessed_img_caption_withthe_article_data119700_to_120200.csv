At age 5, low-income children are more than two years behind in language development,"" said Darrell Steinberg, the state Senate's top Democrat.""Children with low reading skills are 60 percent more likely to drop out of school,"" said Steinberg, who is leaving office at the end of the year and had made the preschool plan his top legislative effort this year.Steinberg's revised proposal, called the ""Fair Start"" bill, would give free preschool to children whose families make less than twice the federal poverty level, using funds that had been earmarked for children of all incomes who turn 5 too late in the year to start kindergarten.The plan, which heads to the lower house on a 26-10 vote, would cost about $1.3 billion.The revamped proposal, unveiled as negotiations over the state budget are heating up, comes at a time when a call for universal pre-K is gaining traction around the country.President Barack Obama called for a broad expansion of public preschool in his State of the Union speech last year, though the move stalled in Congress. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio made universal pre-K a centerpiece of his successful election campaign.""From our perspective, 'low-income' includes about half the kids in the state,"" said Ted Lempert, president of Oakland-based Children Now. ""The need is very significant.""A spokesman for Brown said last week that the governor would review the proposal, but remains concerned that it commits the state to additional spending.

2,POLITICS,The House Finally Voted For Something That Would Improve Background Checks,Sabrina Siddiqui and Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-background-checks_n_5413763.html,,2014-05-29,"Representative Mike Thompson, a Democrat from California, speaks during an interview in Washington, D.C., U.S. on Wednesday, March 13, 2013. Thompson predicted that Congress will pass legislation to expand background checks on gun purchases and called on âresponsible gun ownersâ to speak out in support. Photographer: Julia Schmalz/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cb36260000350083b73a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives on Thursday approved a measure that would boost funding for the nation's background checks system, less than one week after another mass shooting shined the spotlight on congressional inaction on gun control.The amendment, which passed by a vote of 260 to 145, would provide an additional $19.5 million in funding for the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS). The funds would be appropriated toward grant money for states, in order to improve reporting to the national database, which is designed to keep guns out of the hands of individuals with felony convictions and certain mental health issues.The Justice Department has long sought increased funding for the FBI-run database, but the measure is just a minor step in the uphill battle to enact stricter gun laws. Congress still has not passed legislation to require universal background checks, amid stiff opposition from the National Rifle Association.The passage of the measure follows a killing spree in California last Friday, in which 22-year-old Elliot Rodger stabbed three college students to death and fatally shot three more before taking his own life. Rodger legally purchased three handguns prior to carrying out the attack, despite the fact that his parents had warned authorities that Rodger was unstable and potentially dangerous. Rodger was being treated by multiple mental health professionals leading up to the rampage.Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the chief co-sponsor of the amendment, unveiled it late Wednesday for consideration under a broader criminal justice appropriations bill. ""Everyone agrees that we don't want criminals, domestic abusers, or the dangerously mentally ill getting guns. And the first step in stopping this is through background checks,"" Thompson said on the House floor Wednesday. ""But the background check system is only as good as the data you put in it. And right now, all the information isn't getting in,"" he added. ""When the information doesn't get into the system, we can't enforce the law, and dangerous people who otherwise wouldn't pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy guns.""Thompson chairs the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, established after the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The task force introduced a slew of bills aimed at reducing gun violence after Sandy Hook, but none of them were taken up by the GOP-controlled House, where Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said existing laws should be improved instead.The amendment that passed Thursday was aided by rare bipartisan support, with Reps. Pete King (R-N.Y.), Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.), Joe Heck (R-Nev.) and Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) signing on as co-sponsors. It now heads to the Senate, where lawmakers failed one year ago to advance a compromise to expand background checks. Given the House-passed measure simply offers a modest boost to the existing program, it is unlikely that lawmakers in the upper chamber would reject it.The amendment received a major assist on Thursday, when the NRA, the nation's most powerful gun lobby, told HuffPost that it would adopt a ""neutral"" stance on it, neither supporting nor opposing increased funding for the background check system. The NRA's position almost certainly helped the bill win votes from rank-and-file Republicans, who would typically be disinclined to vote for a measure lauded by gun safety groups as a positive step.For the NRA, increased funding for background checks is a tricky issue. For years, the group's leaders have argued vehemently that no new gun control measures should be enacted while NICS remains underfunded. Their logic boils down to the idea that we can't know how well our current system works, or whether we need to expand it, until it's fully funded.In 2011, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told Fox News, ""Look, NRA's all for the Instant Check. We were there before anyone else was even talking about it. We need to fund it, we to make the sure the states turn over their records."" In the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, LaPierre again cited the NICS funding situation as a reason for the NRA's opposition to expanding background checks to cover all gun sales, including those made by private dealers, commonly known as the ""gun show loophole."" Americans for Responsible Solutions, the anti-gun violence group co-founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband, Mark Kelly, praised the amendment's passage.""This will save lives. Gabby and I applaud Members from both sides of the aisle who voted for public safety,"" Kelly said in a statement. ""Today's vote also signaled something more important: that the supposed choice between preserving our gun rights and preventing gun deaths and injuries is a false one,"" he added. ""Moving forward, elected leaders from varied political and geographic backgrounds can and should work together to expand background checks, crack down on gun trafficking, protect women from stalkers and domestic abusers, and more -- all while preserving the firearms rights and traditions that Gabby and I hold dear."""

It is not unusual for the government to make sharp revisions to GDP numbers as it does not have complete data when it makes its initial estimates.The decline in output, which also reflected a plunge in business spending on nonresidential structures, was sharper than Wall Street's expectations. Economists had expected the revision to show GDP contracting at a 0.5 percent rate.The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter. U.S. financial markets are likely to shrug off the report, given the temporary factors that weighed down on growth and the fact that economic activity is rebounding.Data ranging from employment to manufacturing suggests growth will accelerate sharply in the second quarter.Economists estimate severe weather could have chopped off as much as 1.5 percentage points from GDP growth. The government, however, gave no details on the impact of the weather.Businesses accumulated $49.0 billion worth of inventories, far less than the $87.4 billion estimated last month.It was the smallest amount in a year and left inventories subtracting 1.62 percentage points from first-quarter growth. But inventories should be a boost to second-quarter growth.While the decline in exports was not as severe as initially thought, import growth was stronger. That resulted in a trade deficit that sliced off 0.95 percentage point from GDP growth.A measure of domestic demand that strips out exports and inventories expanded at a 1.6 percent rate, rather than a 1.5 percent rate, indicating underlying strength in the economy.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 3.1 percent rate. It was previously reported to have advanced at a 3.0 percent pace.Spending was boosted by the Affordable Healthcare Act, which expanded healthcare coverage to many Americans. Consumer spending had increased at a brisk 3.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter.Business spending on nonresidential structures, such as gas drilling, contracted at a 7.5 percent rate. It had previously been reported to have increased at a 0.2 percent pace. The report showed corporate profits after tax plunged at a 13.7 percent rate, the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2008. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

I appeared in executive producers Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein's earlier collaboration, The Business of Being Born (2008), a critique and commentary on childbirth in America that paved the way for a resurgence of interest in midwifery and home birth, and I assumed that Breastmilk, by filmmaker Dana Ben-Ari, would follow along the same lines. This is not the case. From left to right: Dana Ben-Ari, Abby Epstein and Ricki Lake at the TriBeCa Film Festival premiere, May 7, 2014The film begins without much fanfare, as it gradually becomes apparent that milk is being expressed from a breast. Then a child is seen blowing bubbles into a glass of milk, giggling, as the title appears. This sense of matter-of-fact, innocent confrontation reappears throughout the film. It's not porn, right? Except when women squirt arcing streams of breastmilk across the movie screen as an aria swells in accompaniment. In this case, it feels entirely wholesome while gleefully irreverent, a dream sequence of sorts in a film in which breastfeeding is serious business, demanding a degree of commitment to stick with in a fast-moving, judgmental culture that gives out formula samples routinely.The film centers around and documents the stories and unscripted experiences of several women and families in New York City, meeting some during pregnancy and journeying with them through initial breastfeeding and the first year. Precious early moments after birth, the initial latch, exploring breastfeeding difficulties; all of it feels extremely intimate, yet not intrusive. The film's primary focus is illuminated and given further context by including the thoughts of community health workers, academics and lactation consultants. In addition to a varied cross section of New York City women, there is a gay male couple and their breastfeeding milk donor and a lesbian couple in which the nonbiological mother speaks of experiencing hormonal changes in concert with her partner's pregnancy and lactating within days of initially latching their baby to her own breast. As a woman who is able to breastfeed without having given birth herself, she openly pities biological mothers who can't or don't stick with it.One mother is a careful, soft-spoken biologist whose initial approach to breastfeeding is based on an educated faith in her innate biological programming to simply rise to the occasion. She gradually accepts supplementing with formula and getting her baby's tight frenulum surgically cut in a specialist's office. Another young mother has good intentions, but gives up breastfeeding fairly quickly, realizing that it is time-consuming and inconvenient within the context of attending school and the demands of an impatient partner. The free infant formula she receives makes the decision all the easier. Breast pumping receives mixed reviews -- and mixed results. These women are real, they are sympathetic and they are deftly observed within the critical influences that play into how their breastfeeding journeys unfold.One man interviewed in the film expresses his unfamiliarity and admitted uneasiness with breastfeeding while at the same time intellectually defending it. There are a number of scenes in which the careful pauses between fragments of thoughts and sentences carry the discomfort and novelty of what is being expressed. It made me uncomfortable, prodded my own pro-breastfeeding agenda, and tugged at my heart. Breastfeeding matters that would contribute to life or death in nature or other parts of the world, have, in American culture, seemingly been transformed into morally, even biologically neutral choices that some say should not be judged, yet these choices are viewed by others as tragic. This friction is apparent in the film, while the film itself simply observes, taking no sides, passing no judgment, while making it clear that the decision to feed a baby formula may not really be a choice at all.I spoke with Leigh Anne O'Connor, a lactation consultant who was also in the audience. ""I saw a sadness in the women, and a lot of justification. Not to judge them, but I think that's a very common thing."" She wondered if the film ""might give people the sense that there is a lack of information and support out there,"" and ""conclude that breastfeeding is really hard."" Questions and comments I heard during the Q & A and from people that I spoke with in the audience made it clear that a number of people were disappointed that the film did not push more of a pro-breastfeeding agenda, or at least viewed it as a missed opportunity to say more than it did on the subject. In contrast, one reviewer describes the film as unreasonably pushing too many emotional buttons, and cites controversial studies she cherry-picks to support her assertion that breastfeeding's benefits have been ""overrated"" and that ""formula-fed babies turn out perfectly fine."" Parents whose formula-fed babies turned out to be healthy high achievers mention this fact in comments responding to the film's reviews, as if the blessing of a good outcome might erase risks that are broadly acknowledged medically.The American Academy of Pediatrics makes strong statements in favor of breastfeeding, including in their 2012 advisory document, Divesting from Formula Marketing in Pediatric Care: ""...breastfeeding is the normal, physiologic way to feed newborn infants... and not breastfeeding increases the risk of adverse health outcomes in mothers and their infants...."" It goes on to say that patients need to be protected from the wrong impression that advertising and giving out formula samples in healthcare environments gives, and that ""...it should be noted that there are documented cost savings with the improved health from breastfeeding."" In spite of American laws protecting the right to breastfeed in public, stories of women being harassed for doing just that are all too common. Although breastfeeding should not be an adversarial choice pitting nature against culture, the circumstances of life in the modern world can certainly make it feel and be experienced as such. Leigh Anne reminded me of how mothers in the United States have no right to paid maternity leave, or extended leave that would make breastfeeding a realistic long or even short-term option for many working women. One of the academics interviewed in the film spoke of how many modern breastfeeding problems are not in fact physiological, but sociological. And this information is major food for thought.Rather than seeing the film as a missed opportunity for what it does not say or a nuanced guilt trip for what it implies, I consider it a provocative work of art that creates a contextual lens through which we view the stories and circumstances of real life players contributing to an ongoing dialogue about breastfeeding in American culture. The ""message"" of the film lies in both its subtlety and its complexity. How we the viewers connect the dots and respond personally will stimulate further dialogue, and this is a good thing. Breastmilk is at the intersection of nature, culture, sex, porn, health and food. The film got me thinking. And I am still thinking. One sanitized media photo displays a full, lactating breast expressing a stream of milk, the black censorship dot covering the nipple illuminating this tragicomic celebration of breastmilk all the more.

Right now, we are on track to triple these emissions by century's end.The last time CO2 levels went sky-high, the planet was probably 18 degrees Fahrenheit hotter, with sea levels approximately 120 feet higher than now. But we were not here then to enjoy the overly sultriness of it all. Having been around for 200,000 odd years, our only experience with extreme temperature increase was after the last ice age. The planet heated up seven to nine degrees over thousands of years. Can our grandchildren and great grandchildren handle predicted planetary heating that's 10 times faster?The 2003 heat wave in Europe killed 35,000 people with summer temperatures in parts of France 18 degrees hotter than their 2001 summer.I do not want to scare the pants off anyone, but.... When leading climate scientist, James Hansen, former head of NASA's Goddard Institute, stresses de-carbonization of energy by 2030 or certain climate catastrophe. I think mitigating emissions pronto would be the rational next step, just in case this very smart climate guy is right.But as invisible greenhouse gases rise, so does the very visible conflict that swirls around them. In 2007, California Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, took his fight against CO2 emissions to the Supreme Court. He sued the Bush Administration so that California could enact bigger-muscled vehicle emissions laws. Assembly Bill 32 aims for California's emissions to be 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. In part this will be achieved by the state's ambitious commitment to have 33 percent of its electricity produced by non-CO2-emitting renewable energy by 2020.The state also runs a tight cap and trade program, which unlike the EU's faltering Emissions Trading Systems is working quite nicely. So far it regulates big industry and the energy sector. Already the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power reports a 22 percent emissions drop (in part by having more renewable energy and less coal on the books) but also because fines for going over emissions caps are hefty.But while California aggressively cleans up its act, it has no jurisdiction on nations upwind such as China. Or whom China does energy business with. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates 25 percent of the particulate matter in Los Angeles skies originates from Chinese coal-fired power plants. Some of the dirtiest fuel being burned in these power plants is petcoke from U.S refineries.The EPA has set limits on the domestic burning of petcoke fuel. But this ruling, which lowered overall U.S CO2 emissions, just outsources the emitting location. It doesn't matter whether you're sending it right next door or across the Pacific, the atmosphere is an all-encompassing, amorphous layer of shared gas.  California's unilateral mitigation is a bold step in the right direction. A challenge to the rest of the U.S. But the North American continent seems to have ever-increasing supplies of high carbon fuels and an industry gung-ho on extracting them. The IPCC's (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) March report reiterated the risks involved without immediate reduction of CO2. The same day Exxon Mobile came out with its own 'carbon risk' assessment. The company assured stockholders, ""we are confident that none of our hydrocarbons are now or will become 'stranded.'"" Meaning they will be able to extract all the oil and natural gas they want. The company boasted government restrictions were ""highly unlikely"" to stop Exxon Mobile from oil business-as-usual.  But while Exxon Mobil feels good about the future, there are some cracks in the fossil fuel industry's mitigation-schmitigation façade. Big coal appears to be running scared of non-CO2-emitting energy sources, going so far as to describe the sun as a ""disruptive challenge."" Coal produces 40 percent of U.S electricity, solar clocks in at less than 1 percent, with individual rooftop solar panels a tiny fraction of this amount. But small-potatoes rooftop solar is getting some very negative press these days.""These green energy mandates are bad policy,"" says Christine Harbin Hanson, a spokeswoman for Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group backed by oil industry heavy weights. The AFP is part of recent anti-solar movement that wants states like Kansas and Arizona to slap a surtax on individual rooftop solar. The movement is also pushing states to reduce overall commitments to solar generated energy.While all the back and forth goes on, the CO2, methane and nitrous oxide go up. Up into an atmosphere that once floated like a big security blanket around our planet. It let just the right amount of heat in and out. But it can no longer effectively let all the heat out. We have unwittingly trashed our collective security blanket. Mitigation can and is being enacted on local, state, national and international levels, but the sooner it is a coordinated multilateral effort, the more sense it will make. We need to get serious about the reality of our shared geography. We are one people, under one atmosphere."

But today, according to both food advocates and McDonald's CEO Don Thompson, America's most recognizable clown won't go near a Big Mac. ""You don't see Ronald McDonald in schools. You don't see him eating food,"" Thompson said Thursday at the company's annual shareholder meeting, according to multiple reports. This, health activists say, is so McDonald's can deflect criticism that it willfully markets the unhealthy food to children. ""They think that by not having him consume the food, it's not encouraging kids to patronize the brand,"" said Jesse Bragg of Corporate Accountability International, a food advocacy group that has been pushing for Ronald's retirement for years.In the past, said Bragg, McDonald's has been criticized for having Ronald visit schools to teach phys ed and appear in connection with charities that work on behalf of sick children.The company has kept Ronald at arm's length from its food for years now, nutrition advocates say. ""At least since they joined the Better Business Bureau program in 2006, they've been saying they wouldn't use Ronald McDonald to sell food,"" said Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a group that says it helped persuade McDonald's to join an inititative run by the BBB that sets nutrition standards for advertising food to children under 12.And Ronald's abstemious habits may go back much further than that. Geoffrey Giuliano, who portrayed Ronald in public appearances in the late 1970s and early 1980s and is today an outspoken critic of the company, once said in an interview that he ""was never allowed to eat the food"" while in character because it would have been ""unseemly."" In 2007, Jim Skinner, then CEO of McDonald's, told Reuters that ""Ronald McDonald has never sold food to kids in the history of his existence.""   When asked if it was official policy to keep Ronald McDonald away from the food he was created to promote, McDonald's spokeswoman Becca Hary said only that ""when Ronald McDonald appears in public, he is focused on spreading joy and smiles."" Hary declined to comment on how long this has been the case.Marketing experts say it doesn't really matter whether Ronald is ever actually seen eating in public: Kids will still associate him with Big Macs and Happy Meals. ""Kids are hardwired to think that he equals McDonald's,"" said branding strategist Adam Hanft, founder of the marketing firm Hanft Projects. ""There's a test in marketing where they put people under a full magnetic resonance imaging machine, like a brain scan essentially, and they show people images, and different parts of the brain light up,"" Hanft said. ""If you showed kids Ronald McDonald, all the reward centers of the brain would go f***ing crazy like July 4th. Because he equals the hamburger.""

Today, it's more welcoming for adventurous travelers thanks to a local archaeologist, Armin Walch. Standing atop the Ehrenberg Castle ruins and surveying the valley, which two thousand years ago was the Via Claudia upon which Roman trade crossed from Germany south into Italy, you can appreciate the strategic importance of a castle erected right here. Armin Walch -- who I think of as the Indiana Jones of Tirolean archaeologists -- has endless energy to make his dream of turning Ehrenberg, an ensemble of four castles from four different ages, into a meaningful historical experience. Even in a driving rain, he took us to the highest castle to proudly show off his work in progress. On my last visit a few years, ago I was ""knighted"" by my medievalist friends here in Reutte. Coming down off the mountain, having surveyed the castle ruins with Armin, we were met by the ""Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian"" and his entourage for a fine dinner where I was presented with my own sword (which now resides in the little castle museum). The next day, we dropped by the castle museum with our group and enjoyed letting our imaginations off their leashes. Here, tour guide Reid sets tour member Malcolm up in a suit of mail.

11,RELIGION,Jimmy Carter's Most Important Legacy Is Not His Presidency,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-carer-legacy-redeemer_n_5406413.html,,2014-05-28,"Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter speaks with Mark Updegrove, director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, on the first day of the Civil Rights Summit, Tuesday, April 8, 2014, in Austin, Texas. (AP Photo/Statesman.com, Ralph Barrera, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e79a3c000018010dae1c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON (RNS) There was Jimmy Carter the president, Jimmy Carter the Habitat home builder and now what you might call Jimmy Carter 3.0: international advocate for women’s rights.As he nears 90 and the twilight of his public career, scholars are taking yet another look at Carter, a Baptist Sunday school teacher who continues to find ways to use his four years in the Oval Office as a springboard for his faith-fueled passions.In many ways, Carter appears to be seeking redemption for a presidency that is widely considered a failure, from the energy crisis to the Iranian hostages to his self-diagnosed “crisis of confidence” that overshadowed America in the late 1970s.But ironically, the Nobel Peace Prize winner is now more free to pursue his global crusade than he ever was as president, says Randall Balmer, author of the new biography, “Redeemer: The Life of Jimmy Carter.”“Religion always functions best at the margins of society and not in the councils of power, and I think Jimmy Carter’s career illustrates that beautifully,” said Balmer, chair of Dartmouth College’s religion department and a noted scholar of American evangelicals.“He doesn’t have to worry about getting the approval from Congress on an initiative in Africa on river blindness. He’s not tethered by political considerations any longer.”Perhaps it’s the age of Obama that has prompted a reassessment in some quarters of the ex-president with the wide toothy grin, when progressive Democrats like Carter and Lyndon Johnson are cast in a softer, more sympathetic light. Or maybe it’s growing nostalgia for a distant era when politics seemed more decent, less dysfunctional. Or maybe it’s because Carter just won’t slow down, drawing praise for his humanitarian work even from his critics.Whatever it is, the former peanut farmer is getting a second look — and drawing his own share of headlines.Though unsuccessful in securing ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment as president, Carter has emerged as an advocate against the abuse of women across the world. From the chair next to late-night talk show host David Letterman to the halls of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library, he can discuss the intricacies of female genital mutilation and the high rates of sexual abuse of women at universities and in the military.“I have become convinced that the most serious and unaddressed worldwide challenge is the deprivation and abuse of women and girls, largely caused by a false interpretation of carefully selected religious texts and a growing tolerance of violence and warfare,” Carter wrote in his new book, “A Call to Action: Women, Religion, Violence and Power.”Carter, of course, is no stranger to religious controversies. He famously broke ties with the Southern Baptist Convention after it called for women to submit to their husbands and not be pastors. Men who feel they are superior to women, he said, can find a Bible verse “here or there” that might legitimize their belief.But he prefers to focus on the example of Jesus.“It would be a fruitless search to look through the Scriptures and find one single instance where Jesus did not treat women either equal or superior to men,” he said at a recent forum at The Washington Post.Historian Bill Leonard compared Carter’s faith-based commitment to human rights to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s leadership on civil rights.“There’s this strong head and heart in him,” Leonard, professor of church history at Wake Forest Divinity School, said of Carter. “He’s very realistic. He’s very direct about what he thinks should be done, but underneath that is what I would call this Baptist progressivism.”Timothy George, dean of Samford University’s Beeson Divinity School, was sorry to see Carter leave the SBC and thought his emphasis on the differing views on women was “out of proportion.” But George, one of the more conservative Baptists who agreed to meet with Carter before he left the SBC, respects the former president for his attempts to bring Baptists together and his efforts to eradicate overlooked tropical diseases such as Guinea worm.“He’s done so many wonderful things in his humanitarian role, which grows out of his faith,” George said of the projects promoted through the Atlanta-based Carter Center.Carter also has not given up on his belief that Baptists can bridge racial and theological divides for the common good. Working with the Atlanta-based Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and other Baptist groups, this summer he will highlight “covenants of action,” the next stage of the New Baptist Covenant he began almost a decade ago. So far, there are five pilot interracial projects of Baptists from local congregations from Georgia to Texas working on issues such as predatory lending and literacy.The people who share Sundays with him at his home church in Plains, Ga., say none of Carter’s current work strays from the faith he has long embraced.“What he teaches on Sunday he lives seven days a week,” said Jan Williams, a member of Maranatha Baptist Church, which attracts hundreds of visitors when the former president is in town — and just dozens when he’s not.Jeremy Shoulta, Carter’s new pastor at Maranatha, likewise sees Carter’s faith in Jesus’ teachings in the scope of his post-presidential life.“I don’t see someone who has sort of a compartmentalized faith, where sometimes you see it here and then you look and, well, it’s not there,” the pastor said.This fall in the Dallas area, just days after Carter’s 90th birthday, he and his wife, Rosalynn, intend to lead their 31st “build” with Habitat for Humanity, the Christian nonprofit that constructs homes with people in need of affordable housing.“He doesn’t lack so much for passion as he does for respite after all these years,” said Balmer. “I think he has redeemed himself and yet he continues to push himself.” "

In the case of Maya Angelou, it feels like ""earth school"" (as my brother calls it) has lost one of its greatest teachers. Every time that magnificent woman opened her mouth, I learned something. I'd always grab a pen and write down on whatever I could find the pearl that had fallen from her lips that spoke to me the most that time. And so it always went. I always wept whenever I heard her reading one of her poems or from one of her many books, her distinctive voice and delivery making the authentic words that much more raw and real for me. I have a small list of people I would have liked to have met, to have physically sat at the feet of and listened to, and she is most definitely one of them. But aren't I, we, lucky she shared herself with the world. I gasped and touched my heart when I read that she had died this morning, I think because I felt it to my core, and I knew the weight of the loss for all of us, I just wasn't ready for her voice to be silenced. I used a quote of hers in my introduction to a book of essays I wrote called, Love is My Religio. This is from that introduction: ""Maya Angelou said, 'I speak to the Black experience, but I am always talking about the human condition -- about what we can endure, dream, fail at, and still survive. Now, maybe I speak to the middle-aged white experience, but I surely write about the human condition, specifically my human condition.""In spite of all our vast differences, I related to so many of her words. They made me think about what I can endure, dream, fail at and mercifully still survive. I am currently writing about the life-long struggle with panic disorder I have endured and survived, and I open it again with a thought from Miss Angelou. I had seen her with Oprah on OWN'S Super Soul Sunday program and this was her quote: ""Courage is the most important of all virtues, because without courage you can't practice any of the other virtues."" This had hit me like a ton of bricks, especially in light of the fact that fear was at the root of my panic, and courage has been a life long, and at times elusive, pursuit. It is the virtue I grab by the throat and hang onto for dear life. I know, like Maya, that without it, it is very hard to be the person you want to be. She also said that day that ""Courage has to be practiced."" Say Amen somebody, I know that to be true with all of my being.Maya Angelou always gave me hope, I love that line from her poem ""On the Pulse of Morning"" that she read at Clinton's inauguration, Each new hour holds new chances for a new beginning"" (the line right after that being, ""Do not be wedded forever to fear..."" hello?) Whew, some days, some hours, I need to be reminded of this so badly it takes my breath away. Maybe that is a version of what it means to panic, to forget we continually have chances for a new beginning. How grateful I am to her for reminding me. I loved hearing more of her story that day on Super Soul, it also reminded me that no life goes unscathed, isn't messy around the edges, broken at times in ways that seem beyond repair -- what an amazing story she told: to have been violated so horribly and to stop speaking altogether at age 7. I'd have freaked out if my daughter did that. I'm sure it was a worry to those around her but her grandmother, whom she said she called 'Mama,' said to her one day, ""Sister, people say you are ignorant and can't speak, but I know when you and the good Lord are ready, you'll speak, you'll teach sister -- you'll teach all over the world."" Even Maya said she thought she was crazy for saying that, and yet... Our prophets always say things that seem crazy.When my daughter graduated, I gave her and her close friends a present along with the poem by Mary Oliver that ends with the line, ""Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?"" I think it is one of the greatest lines of all time. As I sit here and reflect on Maya Angelou, I think of the wild and full and graceful and wise... precious life she lived. What a wonder. What an example. What a legacy. What a fragrance she left behind. She lived beyond well, on the collective wisdom of generations, with humility and with what her mother encouraged her: Pizazz! I want to live with pizazz. And courage. And faith. She believed when she prayed something wonderful happened. She believed love could raise the dead. So do I, maybe that's a better title for my book -- Love Can Raise the Dead. I like it. When she was talking about making it to her 80's she said that she had been grateful at every age, and that one of her secrets was 'moderation in all things... even moderation' that made me laugh. She was funny too. For me she embodies so much of what I want, and who I long to be. I will still sit at her feet and learn, long after they have left this earth."

The new video purports to show dozens of abducted schoolgirls, covered in jihab and praying in Arabic. It is the first public sight of the girls since more than 300 were kidnapped from a northeastern school the night of April 14 exactly four weeks ago. (AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13717230000370093cd6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Tim CocksABUJA, May 28 (Reuters) - When Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan branded Boko Haram ""al Qaeda in West Africa"", it was sure to turn up the alarm among Western policy-makers, if its kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls was not enough.Yet while Jonathan's remarks, made at a meeting of regional leaders in Paris this month, hold some truth, analysts say Boko Haram is overall not an al Qaeda affiliate in West Africa - nor is it likely to become one.Boko Haram's own aims remain thoroughly local and its behavior, especially killing Muslim civilians and kidnapping girls, runs against the al Qaeda leadership's current thinking.The insurgents' fight for an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria remains driven largely by domestic factors. It is fast making what is now Africa's largest economy look like a failing state.They could however become a wider international problem down the line, analysts say.In Boko Haram's early days, when it was evolving from a clerical movement to a violent insurrection, the leader of one of several rival factions, Adnan Ibrahim, dubbed it ""al-Qaeda in West Africa"".The label never stuck. Western powers, weary of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, therefore took little interest in the group. This probably gave Boko Haram breathing space at the beginning, said Jacob Zenn, a Boko Haram expert at CTC.""If they had called themselves 'al Qaeda in Nigeria', Boko Haram would have attracted the attention of the West,"" he said.In his numerous videos, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau talks a lot about local gripes and very little about global jihad, although he has made a few appeals to al-Qaeda in what appears to be no more than lip service.""Shekau has several times said that BH (Boko Haram) is part of AQ - or aspires to be. So far, there has been no public response from the AQ leadership,"" said Richard Barrett, an expert on al Qaeda and former coordinator of the United Nations al-Qaeda Taliban Monitoring Team. ""CROSSED THE LINE""The al Qaeda brand has suffered damage in recent years from increasingly extreme groups who assumed its name with a nod from founder Osama bin Laden or, since U.S. forces killed him in Pakistan in 2011, his successor Ayman al-Zawahiri.Their later inability to control them proved embarrassing.The first mistake was Al Qaeda in Iraq, also called Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), whose brutality against civilians turned an initially supportive Sunni population against it from late 2007.Internal correspondence shows Bin Laden - the inspiration behind the 2001 attacks on the United States - realized by 2010 that killings of civilians by jihadist groups had made them a liability, said Nelly Lahoud, a professor at the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.Al Qaeda broke ties with ISI, which is also fighting in Syria, in February. But al-Zawahiri's acceptance of Somalia's al Shabaab, who also kill Muslim civilians on a large scale, shows he was slow to learn from Bin Laden's mistake, Lahoud said.Zawahiri is unlikely to repeat that error with Boko Haram, a group he has never once publicly mentioned.The Egyptian-born cleric last year issued an edict urging Islamist groups not to target civilians, as he sought to rein in jihadist elements.The last thing he needs is to be seen supporting a group that kills hundreds of Muslim civilians. Boko Haram's kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls last month, although it garnered the sect worldwide publicity, will only compound that unease.""The sort of behavior Boko Haram is carrying out doesn't live up to the standards al Zawahiri has set,"" said Lahoud. ""The attacks on civilians and particularly these girls is not something he would sanction. Boko Haram has crossed the line.""AL QAEDA IN THE SAHARAAl Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM) did have firm links with Boko Haram but it is not clear how far this carried on after French forces kicked them out of Malian cities last year.They are reported to have given Boko Haram $250,000 in 2012 and trained its members in kidnapping as a way to raise further money, Barrett said.Though riven by its own internal squabbles, AQIM has focused on strategy sanctioned by Zawahiri and al Qaeda headquarters - hitting high value strategic targets like Algeria's Amenas gas plant in January 2013 and kidnapping Western hostages for money or prisoner swaps.For years intelligence officials have tracked visits by a small groups of Boko Haram fighters to Mali, when its desert north was being overrun by AQIM, and Niger. In both they met Algerian brigades of AQIM fighters for training and weapons.The deadly U.N. headquarters bombing in August 2011 was the only Boko Haram attack targeting a Western institution. The suspected mastermind, Maman Nur, had trained with AQIM and al Shabaab, security officials said.But there are signs AQIM is not totally comfortable with them. A Boko Haram faction called Ansaru, blamed for the killing of several Western hostages, is AQIM's bona fide affiliate in Nigeria, and called itself ""al Qaeda in the Land Beyond the Sahara"" in a video with a British and Italian hostage in 2011.Ansaru broke off from Boko Haram in protest at its killing 186 mostly Muslim civilians in the medieval Islamic city of Kano in early 2012.When AQIM seized northern Mali in early 2012, its leader Abdelmalek Droukdel exhorted its supporters to win the hearts and minds of the local population - not provoking them or applying sharia too harshly or quickly. That seems a far cry from Boko Haram's murderous campaign in northern Nigeria. WHAT'S IN A NAME?Zenn said Jonathan's claim that Boko Haram was no longer just a local threat has some merit - there was a ""financial, ideological and weapons transfer relationship,"" from al Qaeda without which Boko Haram could not have got so violent.Jennifer Giroux, a Senior Researcher at the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zurich, said there were broader known links between various Islamist militant movements in the region.Boko Haram had reached a tipping point, she said, with the state so powerless to curb its activities that it could evolve into a regional issue and join with a global jihad agenda.Even so, some saw Jonathan's statement as a bid to wash his hands of a homegrown issue feeding off poverty and unemployment.""If you paint Boko Haram as an offshoot of a larger international threat, it gives him some level of excuse for the government failure to tackle them,"" said Ben Payton, Senior Africa Analyst at London-based Maplecroft.

He rightly got nailed by the media for saying that 47 percent of the population (whom he acknowledged would never vote for him) does not accept personal responsibility and expects the government to take care of them. His job, he said, was not to worry about this group. Actually, Mr. Romney had it completely backwards. The individuals who merit our collective attention are those who are less privileged, those who work hard but cannot survive without adequate health care among other public services, those who are hungry and struggling. Many of them are older and disabled; many have worked and contributed to the tax base. Many have encountered life's exigencies. Many have served in our Armed Forces. Many have not received a four-year college degree.We had a similarly strong and negative reaction to Paul Tough's recent article, ""Who Gets to Graduate,"" that appeared in the New York Times Magazine on May 15, 2014.Tough rightly notes the significant obstacles faced by first-generation, low-income college students. These students enter into and graduate from college at far lower percentages than their non-first-generation, higher income peers. That said, we take issue with the focus of Mr. Tough's analysis, and we offer one strong caution. In short, he focuses his attention on the wrong students -- the wrong percentage of those who can pursue higher education. Many of America's future college-going population will be first generation and low income. But, and this is key, they will lack Vanessa Brewer's remarkable class rank in high school (top 10 percent) and relatively high ACT score (top 38 percent in the nation). Many students who can and should progress through higher education will not be accepted into UT or other of our nation's elite and selective institutions, even assuming these places would be a good fit.Next, Mr. Tough denigrates the good work being done at the many less selective, non-elite colleges and universities, referring to these institutions as ""mediocre"" because they ""produce more dropouts than graduates."" In short, this large percentage of institutions has a relatively low percentage of students who actually graduate. Under this definition, UT would be characterized as ""mediocre"" if we parsed their data and looked only at the percentage of first generation, low-income students who graduated with a four-year degree. And, all of these UT students are at the top of their high school graduating class!At our institution where we have 65 percent first generation and almost 50 percent Pell-eligible students infrequently in the top 10 percent of their high school class and with SAT scores below 1000 and ACT scores below 20), we have graduation rates that resemble UT's. Our graduation rates (calculated as a percentage), as evidenced by the HERI expected graduation rate calculator, exceed national norms. We are not alone; other small and medium sized colleges regularly outperform national norms for the populations they serve. Are we really all mediocre?  Mr. Tough also falls prey to the popular rhetoric around ""undermatching,"" suggesting that if more first generation students attend elite colleges, graduation rates will rise. The corollary is that community colleges and non-selective colleges are often seen as part of the problem, not part of the solution. Yes, the elites have higher graduation rate percentages for all their students. But, many non-elite four-year and two-year colleges do excellent work; they have developed sound, often empirically supported initiatives that promote student success, including efforts that foster ""belonging"" and positive ""ability,"" keys to the commendable UT efforts. Indeed, positive norming, belief in self, small classes and lack of remediation are cornerstones of the work we do at Southern Vermont College. Importantly, these faculty and staff have decades of experience helping large numbers of at-risk students. The national focus on elite and other selective post-secondary institutions obscures the enormity of the positive work other institutions provide and undermines the valuable information they can share about successful strategies for first-generation college students. The bottom 90 percent of students needs us to help them enter into post-secondary education and for a sizable percentage, entry into and graduation from college, with quality programs that prepare them for graduate education and the workplace of today and tomorrow. Finally, a caution: the valuable pre-orientation intervention with UT students conducted by Yeager does not obviate the need for added support systems during the four years of undergraduate education. As Tough observes, we need to see if the benefits demonstrated at Year One persist into Years Two thru Four. We desperately want and need a single inoculation that promises college success but data tell us that one-time efforts may have short-lived benefits if not coupled with other systemic and ongoing efforts.About this there is no question: improving college graduation percentages lead to improved workforce readiness, increased economic and social parity and enhanced civic engagement. Expanding the funnel of who is part of and listened to in this conversation will benefit all of our nation's current and prospective college students and the institutions that serve them. Stated differently, we need to develop solutions for the 90 percent of the students who are not in the top 10 percent of the class."

Sometimes people provide information, so it's the legal process and we go through the legal process.""When asked by another reporter if he considered protecting a source part of a journalist doing his job, Cole tried to steer the discussion back to the topic of the media briefing, which was prison rape standards.Disclosure: This reporter was once subpoenaed by the Justice Department to testify before a grand jury, but got out of it because he had class."

Just a five-hour flight from New York City, the Scandinavian-influenced capital of Iceland is awakening for the day when tourists from the night's red eye arrive. The sleepy scene promises a quiet retreat, but adventure seekers will also find plenty to occupy their schedules and taste buds.In this week's Top 20 email, a vacation deal from Icelandair has discounted a Northern Lights getaway in a sale ending Saturday. With this deal, depart from Boston, Denver, New York, Newark, Seattle or Washington, D.C., starting at $725 per person.  And while you're there, pick and choose from these suggestions to create your own perfectly balanced long-weekend getaway. Casual food: • Fresh baked bread: Every weekend the Kolaportid indoor flea market presents rows of secondhand clothes, cheap jewelry and other bric-a-brac. At the food stalls, you can sample baked goods such as rúgbrauð, a dense rye bread traditionally baked underground for 12 or more hours in the heated soil near hot springs.• Salmon, cod and lobster. Incredibly fresh seafood such as salmon, lobster, plaice and cod populate menus across the island. We especially enjoyed the namesake meal at Icelandic Fish & Chips and the savory lobster bisque at Saegreifinn, The Sea Baron.• White Russians. We saw White Russians on cocktail menus across Reykjavik, but nowhere matches the selection of 20-plus varieties at Lebowski Bar, themed after the 1998 film. Peruse menu options such as the classic vodka and Kahlua concoction, milkshake versions and the ""Tree Hugger"" with soy milk and hazelnut syrup.Adventurous food: • Rotten shark. The weekend market also sells meats ranging from cured fish to tubes of horse meat. One booth offers tastes of Iceland's infamous hákarl. This dish is prepared by burying a gutted shark in a shallow pit, where it ferments for 6-12 weeks before it's hung out to dry for months. The resulting ammonia taste is so hard to stomach that a Facebook page is dedicated to those who try.• Minke whale, goose and puffin. For a culinary tour of the island, book one of the 10-course tasting menus at Fiskmarkadurinn or Grillmarkadurinn. At the former, we were pleasantly surprised by local game such as the minke whale and cured goose. Brave eaters can also try bites of horse meat and smoked puffin at Tapas Barinn.• Brennivin and Opal. For a round of shots, you can't miss the bottle of neon-green liquor behind every bar. This is Brennivin, a pungent caraway-flavored drink nicknamed the ""black death."" Another common sight is the red and white target label of Opal, a menthol- and licorice-flavored liquor. Non-drinkers can opt for the candy by the same name.Casual activities: • Bus tour of the Golden Circle. The popular Golden Circle route takes travelers past erupting geysers, cascading waterfalls and Thingvellir National Park, where the North American and Eurasian plates are drifting away from each other. Private tours are available for individualized itineraries, and bus tours are a more economical option.• Horseback riding. Ride a shaggy Icelandic horse with tours departing from Reykjavik. This offers a slow pace from which to enjoy the wildlife and volcanic landscapes.• Blue Lagoon. For the ultimate in relaxation, head to the geothermally heated waters of the Blue Lagoon. No matter the temperatures outside, the milky-blue waters are warm enough for spa treatments like in-water massages and scrubs, or for simply lounging with a drink.Adventurous activities:• Snowmobiling on a glacier. Speed across a glacier surface on a snowmobile and take in views of craters and volcanic ridges. You can combine a quick one-hour ride with a Golden Circle tour, or take a multiday excursion.• Volcano hike. Book a tour in a 4x4 to remote volcanic landscapes, where you can traverse across freshly cooled lava. One tour even lowers you deep inside the crater of the now-dormant Thrihnukagigur volcano via an open cable lift.• Dog-sledding. Become a musher for an hour or a day as you ride behind a pack of huskies on a dog-sledding tour. These unique experiences are often pricey, especially if you need transportation to the sledding site.Travelzoo Tip: Search for flights into Reykjavik on Fly.com.-- Kelsey Rexroat is an editor at Travelzoo and based in New York.

21,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Why Early Polling Still Matters For Forecasts,Mark Blumenthal and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/early-polling-forecasts_n_5406483.html,,2014-05-28,"The late afternoon sun illuminates the U.S. Capitol as dark skies recede following blustery weather, Friday, Feb. 21, 2014, in Washington. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cb173c000020010df5a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Prominent modelers debate the value of polls to early electoral forecasts. The conservative advantages shrink on self-reported ideology on economics and social policy. And most Americans want to unskew Karl Rove's comments. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, May 28, 2014.THE VALUE OF POLLS TO EARLY FORECASTS - Sam Wang, in an article that handicaps the election forecast models: ""Today, there’s a glut of forecasts out there, each one promising to be more accurate than the last….Polls tend to be scarce before Memorial Day, so early predictions of the November election outcome must rely on indirect indicators of how voters are likely to behave—what we call 'fundamentals.'...Once polls become available, they can capture the same ballpark range of November performance that fundamentals do—and with much less uncertainty. Years of polling have shown that what voters say they want 'right now' is a strong starting point for predicting, give or take a few points, how they will vote in the fall. Because of that—no matter the race—the most accurate predictions are made using polling data, when enough of it is available. The bottom line: Even at this early stage, polls are our best way to predict November outcomes. In the 2012 election, for instance, polling data available in July and knowledge of how far presidential polls tend to move in the months leading up to the election were enough to give President Obama’s reelection a probability of 91 percent. That crept up to nearly 100 percent as the election approached."" [Politico]Early Senate polls almost as accurate as those in October - Wang's argument echoes findings reported by Harry Enten in April: ""I took a RealClearPolitics-style average of all the polls for 107 races since 2006...I produced this chart, which shows that early polls do a pretty good job of forecasting the final vote margin. The average error between the early polls and the final results was 6.4 points. For comparison, in the 2012 Senate race, polls taken in the final month before the election still had an average error of 4.8 points. Overall, the president’s party’s candidate won 83 percent of the time he or she led in the early poll average and lost 88 percent of the time when he or she trailed."" [538]Use of polls: 'key difference' between NYT & Post models - Andrew Prokop: ""The Upshot has created a model that's mostly based on polling, with fundamentals playing a supplementary role. 'The mixture of polling vs. background varies from race to race,' Josh Katz of the New York Times tells me, 'But as of today, the background model can account for anywhere from about one-third of the forecast to less than 5 percent.' Accordingly, the Upshot's results much better reflect recent polling putting Democrats ahead in several close races. The Post, by contrast, doesn't currently use polls at all — their model is entirely based on fundamentals. They lay out the broader conditions for each state's race, and make their projections based on those. They plan to add polls eventually, but they wanted to emphasize the fundamentals first. 'We wanted to take a more cautious approach and incorporate polls gradually,' says Eric McGhee of the Monkey Cage, one of the model's co-creators."" [Vox]CONSERVATIVE ADVANTAGE SHRINKS ON ECONOMICS, SOCIAL POLICY - Jeffrey M. Jones: ""More Americans continue to identify themselves as conservatives than as liberals on economic and social matters. However, the conservative advantage on each dimension is shrinking from higher points in recent years, down to 21 points on economic policy and four points on social policy….The trends toward lower conservative advantages were evident as far back as 2004 on social ideology and 2007 on economic ideology, though both were interrupted in 2009 and 2010 when President Barack Obama and a Democratic Congress passed left-leaning legislation, most notably the Affordable Care Act….In recent years, Republicans' views on social issues have been steady, while Democrats have been increasingly likely to identify their social views as liberal, particularly in the past four years. This means that Democrats are largely driving the shrinking conservative advantage on social issues among all Americans."" [Gallup]MOST DISAPPROVE OF KARL ROVE QUESTIONING HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH - HuffPollster: ""Most Americans think Karl Rove crossed the line in questioning Hillary Clinton's fitness as a presidential candidate, according to a Washington Post/A BC poll released Wednesday. The survey found that 66 percent Americans disapproved of 'the Republican strategist Karl Rove raising questions about Hillary Clinton's age and health,' while just 26 percent approved. The survey didn't ask how many Americans had been aware of Rove's comments, or go into further detail about what they were. Partisanship factored into the responses -- Democrats were most likely to oppose the comments, with 84 percent finding them unacceptable. But some Republicans and independents who said they wouldn't support a Clinton candidacy still viewed Rove's comments negatively. Republicans, few of whom back Clinton, were about evenly split, with 45 percent approving of Rove's comments, and 46 percent disapproving. Just about half of independents supported Clinton's candidacy, while 64 percent disapproved of Rove's comments toward her."" [HuffPost, via WashPost]FTC REPORT PAINTS DETAILED PICTURE OF DATA BROKERS - Craig Timberg: ""Are you a financially strapped working mother who smokes? A Jewish retiree with a fondness for Caribbean cruises? Or a Spanish-speaking professional with allergies, a dog and a collection of Elvis memorabilia? All this information and much, much more is being quietly collected, analyzed and distributed by the nation’s burgeoning data-broker industry, which uses billions of individual data points to produce detailed portraits of virtually every American consumer, the Federal Trade Commission reported Tuesday. The FTC report provided an unusually detailed account of the system of commercial surveillance that draws on government records, shopping habits and social-media postings to help marketers hone their advertising pitches. Officials said the intimacy of these profiles would unnerve some consumers who have little ability to track what’s being collected or how it’s used — or even to correct false information. The FTC called for legislation to bring transparency to the multibillion-dollar industry and give consumers some control over how their data is used....Yet privacy advocates see little hope of action on Capitol Hill. 'There’s no political pressure on Congress, really, to act. The data-broker lobby is in­cred­ibly powerful,' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. He noted that political campaigns routinely use information collected by data brokers to tailor their election and fund-raising messages to targeted groups. 'They’re not going to vote against their political self-interest,' he said."" [WashPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday via email!

My fellow entrepreneurs: It is a privilege to be among the first people to congratulate you on completing your time at Babson. I am especially honored to be here because I have had the privilege of working with the Babson community and I am in awe of what you do. There are many incredible colleges that teach business. But there is only one school that has focused its curriculum on entrepreneurship for the past 35 years ...-- only one school whose undergraduate and graduate programs are ranked No. 1 in entrepreneurship...--and only one school that has literally written the book on ""the new entrepreneurial leader.""The path you've embarked on is truly exciting, but it can also be challenging. Here's what Babson has taught you: Being an entrepreneur isn't just a job title, and it isn't just about starting a company. It's a state of mind. It's about seeing connections others can't, seizing opportunities others won't, and forging new directions that others haven't. It's about being entrepreneurial wherever you are and in whatever you do. It's about having the courage to give in to passion for an idea that makes your heart race. If it doesn't scare you, you're probably not dreaming big enough. Here is what I've learned: We may live in an age of instant messaging, instant gratification, and Instagram, but there is no way to short circuit the path to success. It takes hard work, tenacity and patience.There are many things you can do overnight. You can write a decent paper. You can put the finishing touches on a runway show. I hear you can even have a pretty good time at Roger's Pub.But there is no such thing as an overnight success. It's a myth that glosses over what being an entrepreneur is all about. As Biz Stone, one of the founders of Twitter, put it: ""Timing, perseverance, and 10 years of really hard work will eventually make you look like an overnight success.""The good news is that if you're willing to pursue your passion, put in the hard work, and believe in yourself, you will succeed.   That's something that I didn't know when I was your age. When I was sitting where you are today, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I had grown up on a farm outside of Philadelphia. I was a tomboy, who spent all of my time playing outdoors with my three brothers. My interest in fashion was limited. In fact, I didn't put on a dress until my senior prom, but fashion was clearly in my DNA. My parents had impeccable style. I channeled their love for beauty into a love for art and design, and went to the University of Pennsylvania to study art history. I applied for many jobs my senior year of college. There was a Yugoslavian designer whose clothes my mother wore. His name was Zoran and three days before graduation, I cold-called him and asked for a job. He said yes, on one condition -- I had to start in a week. On graduation day, all I could think about was finding an apartment in New York. It was a whole new world. Zoran was a true eccentric with a long black beard that last year's Red Sox team would have admired. He was minimalist. Everything in the office was white, there were no chairs -- and the vodka started flowing at 10 a.m. As his assistant, I did everything from getting coffee to running interference. People would come to the office, and Zoran would hide in the bathroom. I'd have to pretend he wasn't there. It was a fantastic entrée into the fashion industry. I was exposed to all the elements of a designer's world, from designing a collection to managing press to learning about the business side. Fashion quickly became my passion. While at Zoran, I was offered a job at Harper's Bazaar. From there, I moved into PR and marketing - first at Ralph Lauren, then at Vera Wang, and then working for Loewe. What I learned is what Babson taught all of you: Even if you're not yet an entrepreneur, you can be entrepreneurial in everything you do. If you view each stop as an opportunity to learn something, there is always something you will take away from that experience. While at Loewe, I was offered the job of president at about the same time that I learned I was pregnant with my third son. I realized I couldn't do that job and be the kind of mom I wanted to be so I decided to take some time off to focus on my family. It was a tough decision. Having a career was important to me -- and I knew it would be part of my life again.It was during that time that I began developing the concept for my company. It all started when I noticed a void in my own closet for beautifully designed, classic pieces that didn't cost a fortune. It wasn't just a void in my closet; it turned out to be a white space in the market. I started working out of my apartment with a small team that could help me turn my concept into a reality. Like most start-ups, we had to fundraise. I asked a lot of people I knew to invest, including some people who couldn't easily afford it. I was terrified of losing people's money, so I told them ""only invest if you're prepared to lose it."" Over 100 people said yes. With the money we raised and a personal investment, we set up an office in Hong Kong for production and sourcing and I traveled there often. When I was home, we talked every evening. Given the time difference, that meant I'd be on conference calls until 3 or 4 in the morning. On those nights, my definition of success was not dozing off on the phone. We also leased a small space on a low-rent corner of Manhattan--and ordered a first shipment of products to fill it. I was warned many times against opening a retail store. There were a lot of naysayers who thought I should start with a wholesale partner and build the brand from there. But I wanted a unique experience. Retail design at the time was very spare. I wanted to do something different. I wanted the boutique to be warm and inviting, like you were walking into a room in someone's home. It was also unusual to launch with multiple categories and ecommerce, but from Day 1 it was a lifestyle brand.We opened our first store in February 2004, during New York Fashion Week. My stepdaughters and I worked through the night to get everything ready. We opened our doors at 10 -- without the actual doors, which hadn't arrived. I was afraid no one would come, but thankfully, the space became so packed that women were trying on clothes in the middle of the store. By 6 p.m., we'd sold through nearly all of our inventory. A few months later, we got a call from Oprah. I thought it was one of my brothers playing a joke on me. ""Yes sure, I'll cancel spring break to be on Oprah.""After I appeared on Oprah, our website got 8 million hits. The media called us an overnight success. I guess that made sense -- if you didn't count the 20,000 hours we put into building the business up to that day, or the combined half a million hours we all spent learning the industry in the years before that. Today, we are a global brand with more than 120 freestanding boutiques and a presence in more than 3,000 department and specialty stores worldwide. From the beginning, one of the reasons I wanted to start a company was to start a foundation. Social responsibility was always part of the business plan. This was not always viewed as a positive -- some people told me never to mention the word social responsibility and business in the same sentence. That only made me more determined.I knew our foundation would benefit women and children. We had learned so much from our experiences starting a business that we thought we could help other women who wanted to do the same. In 2009 we launched our foundation to support the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs and their families. It has been incredibly meaningful not only to me personally, but to our customer, our employees and our business partners, all of whom care about giving back and helping women. In 2012, we partnered with Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses to offer a nine-week MBA course for promising women entrepreneurs with no formal business education. I am proud to say that the school that helped us design that program was Babson. This January, in partnership with Bank of America, we launched an initiative called Elizabeth Street Capital, named for the location of our first store. Through this initiative we are providing women entrepreneurs with access to the capital and mentoring support they need to launch and scale their businesses. I hope some of you will come to us when you're ready!Today, it has been 10 years since we launched and in many ways I feel like we're just beginning, but I never could have gotten here overnight. One of the best pieces of advice I ever received from my parents is to think of negativity as noise. Believe in yourself and what you're doing.Remember: If the most unique ideas were obvious to everyone, there wouldn't be entrepreneurs. The one thing that every entrepreneurial journey has in common is that there are many, many steps on the road to success. Thank you for the opportunity today to be a part of yours."
