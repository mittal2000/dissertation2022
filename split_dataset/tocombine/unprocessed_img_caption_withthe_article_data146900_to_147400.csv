A study by researchers at UC Berkeley revealed why just one sleepless night can make us crave calorie-dense junk food like hamburgers, potato chips and sweets. While previous studies have linked unhealthy foods and sleep deprivation, the UC Berkeley study may reveal the source of the connection.Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the brains of 23 healthy young adults after a normal night's sleep, and again after a sleepless night. Participants were shown images that ranged from foods like apples, strawberries and carrots to foods like pizza and doughnuts while their brain activity was measured. As an incentive, they were told they would receive the food they most desired after the MRI.Not only did the sleep-deprived individuals crave the unhealthy choices, but their brains behaved differently as well. The study found impairment in the area of the brain that governs complex decision-making, and increased activity in the area of the brain that governs rewards.""The results shed light on how the brain becomes impaired by sleep deprivation, leading to the selection of more unhealthy foods, and, ultimately, higher rates of obesity,"" said Stephanie Greer, the study's lead author, in a release.Greer also said that while the study's results may be troubling, there is a silver lining.""The findings indicate that getting enough sleep is one factor that can help promote weight control by priming the brain mechanisms governing appropriate food choices,"" she said.

Read on to find out if your travel plans cross any of America's most troubled bridges.",2013-08-06,"No. 1 Storrow Drive WB over Storrow Drive EB (Storrow Drive Tunnel), Boston",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d68b72400005100539461.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Traffic came to a screeching halt one Thursday in May 2013 when a truck carrying an oversize load hit Washington's 1-5 Skagit River Bridge, causing a partial collapse of the 58-year-old steel truss bridge and sending three vehicles into the water below.While there were no casualties and repairs are under way, the incident has drawn attention to the condition of aging bridges across the nation. And now that road-trip season is in full swing, we wanted to take a closer look.Consider Boston's Storrow Drive, a double-deck roadway abutting Back Bay. Although nearly 60,000 cars cross this bridge heading west daily, few drivers may realize the condition of what's beneath their tires: the structure, which carries the road's westbound lanes over the eastbound, has been deemed ""entirely insufficient"" based on an evaluation formula used by government bridge inspectors.The Storrow bridge's design flaws and corroding support beams make it one of many highly trafficked bridges in the nation to earn a low sufficiency rating--a score that indicates a bridge's sufficiency to stay in service. While a bad rating doesn't necessarily mean danger is imminent, when combined with high traffic volumes, it signals possible trouble for a bridge.A majority of the nation's dangerous bridges are found in the Northeast, including No. 2 Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey. The disparity can be partly blamed on local conditions, according to Brian Leshko, a bridge expert with HDR, a global engineering firm based in Omaha, NE: steel tends to corrode more quickly in humid climates, especially where salt is used to de-ice roads in the wintertime.One thing these bridges have in common, whether in Oregon or Louisiana, is age. All are more than 45 years old, and they've got company nationwide. Many structures from the bridge-building boom of the 1950s were designed for a 50-year lifespan, Leshko says. ""When you do the math, you can see why we are where we are.""Although many insufficient bridges are undergoing major rehabilitation or replacement, such improvements require years of work, and in the meantime millions of cars still rely on them daily. William Ibbs, professor of civil engineering at UC Berkeley, points out that the risk is often a fiscal one: these troubled bridges are expensive to fix, yet left untended, they could be forced to close, costing the people and industries that use them time, money, and inconvenience.As the nation's infrastructure continues to age, more large-scale projects will be necessary to keep our bridges in safe working order, according to David Goldberg of advocacy group Transportation for America, which recently released a report claiming 1 in 9 bridges is deficient, affecting more than 260 million Americans daily.""We're going to see a wave of bridges that are going to need major overhaul or replacement,"" Goldberg says. ""That's something we need to be ready for.""Read on to find out if your travel plans cross any of America's most troubled bridges. --Sarah L. StewartThe MethodologyWe analyzed 2012 data from the Federal Highway Administration for nearly 700,000 bridges, focusing on the subset with an average daily traffic volume (ADT) of more than 50,000 vehicles. We ranked those bridges according to their sufficiency rating (SR): a percentage from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), which is determined by a government formula that factors in a bridge's structural adequacy, safety, serviceability for modern use, and essentiality to the public. As civil engineer William Ibbs put it, ""Those two variables are the standard measures we use for assessing bridge risk."" The resulting list reveals America's high-traffic bridges with the worst sufficiency ratings (after removing 11 that are closed or have substantial improvements either completed or expected to be completed in the next year).More from Travel + Leisure: World's Scariest Bridges World's Scariest Runways World's Scariest Hikes America's Snobbiest Cities Take the T+L 2013 America's Favorite Cities Survey!"

Of course! We would be delighted.As we sat at a long wooden table, Yaco served up Mudai, maize chicha, made by cooking ground corn in water, adding masticated maize meal, and allowing the mixture to ferment. It was a refreshing, milky and slightly sour drink, not at all unpleasant. But after a few glasses, Yaco asked that I follow him outside, to a small pen out back. ""You are an honored guest. You will have Ñachi.""There he grabbed a tethered goat, and cutting the line, circled the rope tight around the animals' back legs, and with another rope, hung the goat by its hindquarters from an Araucanía tree branch. Then, with one hand, he grabbed a large wooden bowl, one of several on a low table, and with the other hand he picked up a machete. In a flash he slit the throat of the hanging goat.As the hot blood poured out he captured it in the bowl, and then another bowl, and another, until we had enough for the place settings. We carried them inside, and there he added coriander and salt, and squeezed lemon juice into the steaming broth, which made the blood coagulate, turning it into a hot pudding. Then, the bowls were placed in front of the guests.""Salud,"" I said feebly, and lifted the heavy bowl to my mouth. The smell niffed my nose as the bowl reached my lips. I closed my eyes; I held my breath. I took a sip. Before I could register my mouth was full, cheeks bulging with body-heat gore the texture of custard, silky and vital and forcing open my constricted throat. I swallowed. Great visceral chugs. It poured, velvety and unctuous, down my gullet, and I kept envisioning the goat, bleating in its last moments.Then my throat seized, and the blood began to move backwards, upwards. I quickly excused myself, and ran out the backdoor, and there expelled all traces of the poor goat.Despite attempts to assuage the host with niceties, it was the worst meal in the world.##"

Even though there aren't quite enough breweries in Colorado to try a new brew each sunny day, there are more than 160 breweries in the Centennial State, so we're getting there.Summer means seasonal in the brewery world and many of Colorado's best and brightest are rolling out their summer offerings. Narrowing down which summer beer to select can be a challenge, but never fear. We've done the heavy lifting (12 oz curls) and selected the top five summer seasonal beers from Colorado. These beers are only available for a limited time, so make sure you drink 'em while it's hot.  Belgian Style Pale Ale (Upslope Brewing Company, Boulder)New in April, 2012 (though Upslope has been brewing it since 2009), Upslope's Belgian Pale Ale has a fruity aroma, a refreshingly light body and a deceptive kick with 7.5 percent ABV (alcohol by volume), all without losing the spicy notes -- like coriander -- that embody a Belgian-inspired ale. Perfect for sippin' in the sunshine, the Belgian Style Pale Ale is packaged in a can for your conveyance convenience.  Taking a cue from the Belgians, there's really no wrong time to crack open a Belgian Style Pale Ale, says Katie Hill, marketing manager at Upslope. ""Whether you're hanging with friends poolside, cooling down after mowing the lawn or enjoying a post-ride refreshment, this summertime ale is sure to hit the spot.""Heyday (Great Divide Brewing Co., Denver)A brand-new seasonal from Great Divide, Heyday is a Belgian-Style White Ale (think along the lines of Blue Moon or Avery's White Rascal) that Mark Slattery, the Denver Beer Guy, describes as ""quite possibly one of the best summer seasonals in the country. This Belgian-style white ale is both refreshing and flavorful, with just the right amount of hop kick and enough flavor to know that you're drinking a quality craft beer.""  Though Great Divide made its name in the biz with high alcohol beer, Heyday is ""light, spritzy and sessionable,"" with only 5.2% ABV, says Anna Nadasdy, Director of Sales and Marketing at Great Divide. Try it with a splash of orange juice for a Brewmosa at lunch or during an afternoon of lawn games: ""I've found having a bottle of it in hand really improves my bocce technique,"" explains Anna.St. Lupulin (Odell Brewing Co, Fort Collins)Odell introduced St. Lupulin in summer of 2010 and the dry hopped, extra pale ale has been delighting beer aficionados ever since. With a crisp lemongrass aroma, Eli Kolodny, Quality Control Manager at Odell Brewing Co, recommends keeping the fridge stocked with St. Lupulin for drinking ""right after dinner. When the sun is going down, it's time to hit up the porch.""  While St. Lupulin will remain Odells signature summer beer (like the Highlander,there can be only one), check out a new session beer called Loose Leaf in the Montage Variety Pack, which is only available in the summer.  Good Juju (Left Hand Brewing Co, Longmont)Brewed to celebrate the vernal equinox (translation: the first day of spring), Good Juju was first released in its current incarnation as a spring/summer seasonal in spring 2010, though its organic ginger goodness was conceived of in 1994. A light and refreshing ale, Good Juju has a spicy aroma and a unique flavor, not unlike the ginger beer we swigged as kids.  Due to its lower alcohol content (at only 4.5% ABV, it's one of the lightest seasonals available), Left Hand Marketing and PR Coordinator Emily Armstrong says that you can enjoy Good Juju with any activity under the sun. ""Since it's so light and refreshing, it really fits well with hot days in a way that not all beers can.""Mark gives us an even better excuse: ""Good Juju might be this summer's 'healthiest beer' as the ginger-packed spice ale is sure to have some homeopathic qualities."" Though he's not a doctor, I think he might be on to something. Mexican Logger (Ska Brewing Co, Durango)Though this Mexican style lager was first brewed in 2000, Ska Brewery only started canning it in 2011, allowing the namesake beer of the Mexican Logger Superhero Carlos Javier--from Ska's original comic book story and business plan--to be enjoyed anywhere a tab can be popped. At 5% ABV, Mexican Logger is light bodied and flavorful, with a crisp finish and a playful nip of Saaz hops.  ""You ask some beers if they want to go rafting, or hiking, and they're like, 'Oh, I don't know if my bottle can do that,' or, 'It's too hot out for me,' or they come up with some other excuse,"" said Matt Vincent, Ska's VP of Operations and summer adventure connoisseur. ""Mexican Logger is like, 'I'm already packed--get in.' No drama--just a tasty beer that loves summer and is ready to go.""  For those looking for what could almost be a seasonal anomaly, Ska also brews seasonal stouts: one for each changing season. Keep an eye out for the Orange Cream Stout, brewed with orange blossom honey and aged on sweet orange peels; its debuting on June 21 at tasteful taps around the country.  These beers were selected not only for their summer-worthy tastes and characteristics, but also because they're widely available. For even more great summer seasonals, visit one of the many taprooms and tasting rooms in Colorado for can't-get-it-anywhere-else goodness.  By Katie Coakley, Katie on the Map"

There are certainly worse ruts to be stuck in, but Italian cuisine has so much more to offer beyond the heavy fall and winter dishes we tend to associate with it. There is a reason that Italian grandmas live forever and everyone looks healthy and happy: the eat really, really well, with a focus on seasonal vegetables, simple cooking techniques and lots and lots of olive oil. We think everyone should let the Italians commandeer their summer cooking for a month or two.In fact, you probably find yourself eating Italian-inspired dishes for most of the summer. Those bean and chickpea salads we all dive into at backyard barbecues, the thinly sliced vegetable carpaccios we can't get enough of and the cooling end of meal panna cotta and gelato all have their roots in Italian summer recipes. There's even minestrones designated for each season, summer being one of the best because of all the fresh tomatoes and squash. Thanks for everything, Italy -- we've been eating really well this summer thanks to you.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. "

Thinking of airplanes as having distinct personalities is something we did in the Air Force too, and back in the day, the plane's personas were expressed through nose art. ""Spook 50"" (a KC-135 tail with tail number 58-0050) was one of my favorites. That plane was rumored to be haunted and strange, inexplicable things seemed to happen when flying in it. I want to encourage parents and teachers to take this moment, as Disney debuts this movie this weekend and causes millions of kids to get excited about aviation, to keep the buzz going with books. I want to call your attention especially to books where women are the pilots and aircrew members. Seeing images of a woman flying the plane is important, of course, for little girls to spark their imaginations about a fascinating career, but it's equally critical for boys to see those images. That way, your son isn't the one to one day tell a girl she cannot fly airplanes because she's not a boy. To help you keep their excitement going after you see the movie, and to keep that aviation buzz going as school starts up again, here are three books where women are the stars in the cockpits:First, here a brand new bilingual children's book, an Amazon bestseller when it debuted on the 4th of July. Titled Good Night Captain Mama / Buenas Noches Capitán Mamá  [ISBN: 9780983476030] this unique picture book stars Marco, the child of a Latina mommy who flies military air refueling airplanes. You can see many reviews here and at Amazon. This is the first bilingual children's picture book that shows young children (ages 3-8) why women and mommies wear military flight suits and serve.  The book was inspired by my military aviation career and my son's curiosity. At the publisher's site, you'll see Teacher Packs of Captain Mama books and embroidered military patches, perfect for classroom teachers to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month AND Veterans Day in November. The book includes a cool patch design project in the back and fresh, positive imagery of Latinas in military uniforms (instead of devious maid uniforms.) Second, there's Pilot Mom by Kathleen Benner Duble. [ISBN: 9781570915550] Duble is the daughter of a military pilot, whose sister flew military tanker planes. The child character is a little girl who learns of her mommy's unusual career.  Next, there's Penelope Pilot  [ISBN: 9780615344331] written by U.S. Army veteran and now airline pilot Lynda Meeks, founder of a non-profit organization called Girls with Wings. With the tagline ""Girls need flight plans, not fairy tales,"" this is simply one of the best organizations you can find to receive a continuous flow of women aviator role models for the girls and women in your life who may have dreams of flying. Plus, they award scholarships too.  Finally, for a really cool book written by another woman military veteran, retired Navy aviator Linda Maloney, take a look at Military Fly Moms. [ISBN: 9780978736972] It's a gorgeous collection of essays from military mommies and veterans, with color photos of their airplanes and their children. The quotes from kids section at the end are worth the book's price alone. ""My mommy flies helicopters. What does your mommy fly?"" Precious!  Let's take this opportunity Disney has created to excite our children with planes, with the magic and fun that is aviation and let's really plant the seeds of curiosity about airplanes with books after the movie ends. I hope the four titles suggested here continue to spark your child's interest in airplanes. After all, those who fly onboard airplanes for a living as I did after college, all studied STEM subjects after loving math and science in school. What a great connection to make for them as we get ready to go back to school. See you at the movies!"
