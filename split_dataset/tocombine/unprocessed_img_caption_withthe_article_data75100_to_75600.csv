0,POLITICS,Joe Biden Is Either Running For President Or Having A Hell Of A Time Playing Us,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-president-2016_us_562647f2e4b0bce3470226c8,"C'mon, man.",2015-10-20,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Vice President Joe Biden may not end up deciding to run for president, but he certainly sounded like a candidate on Tuesday.Speaking at a forum in Washington honoring one of his predecessors, former Vice President Walter Mondale, Biden made several veiled digs at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and boasted of his close working relationship with President Barack Obama. At times, the vice president truly sounded as if he were on stage at a Democratic presidential debate -- either that, or he's just enjoying his time in the limelight.For the second time this week, Biden implicitly knocked Clinton for saying at the first Democratic debate that she considered Republicans her ""enemy."" “I don’t think my chief enemy is the Republican Party. This is a matter of making things work,"" Biden said Tuesday. He touted his ability to work with congressional Republicans, saying, ""Whenever there’s a problem, I get sent to the Hill, which, by the way, is a useful use of my time.""The vice president is expected to announce soon whether he'll throw his hat into the ring. If he does, Clinton, the current front-runner, will be his main rival. Speculation reached a fever pitch this week after several news organizations reported Biden was likely to challenge Clinton, but the reports were soon contradicted by aides who maintain he has not yet made up his mind.The vice president on Tuesday also disputed Clinton's account of the administration's internal deliberations about whether to go after Osama bin Laden. Clinton said in 2013 that she had firmly supported the decision at the time, while Biden and then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had not.But Biden said at the forum that only two officials gave the president definitive advice on the matter -- former CIA director Leon Panetta, who supported the raid on bin Laden's compound, and Gates, who was against it. The vice president added that he later indicated his support to Obama privately.Biden also played up his foreign policy credentials and his close relationship with the president, which would both be potential advantages over Clinton. Reprising an argument he makes frequently, the vice president noted that Obama trusted him to represent the country abroad.""We’ve had two great secretaries of state. But when I go [overseas], they know I am speaking for the president,"" he said.Biden also boasted that he spends four to seven hours with Obama per day.""I attend every meeting the president has. I didn’t ask to do that. At his request!"" he said. The vice president also displayed his well-known tendency to speak his mind. When the conversation turned to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who is almost universally reviled among Democrats, Biden said he viewed him favorably.""I actually like Dick Cheney, for real,"" he said. ""I think he’s a decent man.""But after Mondale pushed back, arguing that Cheney had taken the vice presidency to the ""dark side,"" Biden quickly walked back his remark, claiming there was ""no similarity"" between Cheney's record and his own.Speaking of Cheney's controversial vice presidency, Biden said, ""That could not have happened without President [George W.] Bush letting it happen,"" adding that Cheney ""had lost President Bush's confidence.""Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will meet with the parents of a woman who was killed in a mass shooting in 2012 to discuss the Democratic presidential candidate's vote in favor of a controversial gun law.The Sanders campaign told The Huffington Post Tuesday that it had arranged for the senator to meet with Lonnie and Sandy Phillips, whose daughter, Jessica Ghawi, died at age 24 in the shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado.The couple wants to speak with Sanders about his support for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers and dealers from legal liability. The legislation prohibits civil liability lawsuits against the manufacturers, distributors and dealers of guns and ammunition for ""damages, injunctive or other relief resulting from the misuse of their products by others.""The PLCAA is personal for the Phillipses. Last year, they sued the company that sold the bullets to the gunman who killed their daughter, and the legislation played a role in getting that lawsuit dismissed. “We are aware of your vote on the Protection of Legal Commerce in Arms Act and that you still stand beside that decision,” Lonnie and Sandy Phillips wrote in an email they say they sent to Sanders’ staff on Oct. 8. “We would like an opportunity to meet with you and have a dialog on this issue so we can better understand why you made the decision to vote for this egregious law.”The couple sued Lucky Gunner, which owns bulkammo.com, in September 2014 for selling 4,000 rounds of ammunition to James Holmes, the Aurora shooter, without vetting him. The suit also named three other online retailers that sold Holmes ammunition and other paraphernelia.A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in June, and ordered the parents to pay over $200,000 to Lucky Gunner to cover the company's legal fees. According to Jonathan Lowy, director of the legal action project for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the 2005 law was part of the reason for dismissal. (The Brady Center represented the Phillipses pro bono in the lawsuit.)The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which has been working with the Phillipses, confirmed on Tuesday that the meeting with Sanders has been scheduled.“The gesture is appreciated,” Ladd Everitt, the coalition's communications director, told HuffPost. “Some great dialogue on gun issues is happening right now in Democratic politics and we want Senator Sanders to be part of that. We want him to lead on this.”Everitt declined to comment on the timing or the location of the meeting, deferring to the Phillipses. Neither the Phillipses nor Sanders' staff responded to questions about when and where the conversation will occur.Sanders voted for the 2005 law as a member of the House of Representatives and, until recently, defended the vote without reservation. Earlier this month, however, Sanders said he would be open to amending the legislation, claiming he had backed it out of concern for small-time gun sellers, not for gun manufacturers.Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have identified his record on gun policy as one of the few areas where they can portray themselves as more progressive than the fiery independent senator.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley invited the Phillipses to the first Democratic debate last Tuesday, and used their story as a way to attack Sanders for supporting the PLCAA.“You want to talk about a -- a rigged game, Senator? The game was rigged,” O’Malley said of the Phillipses' lawsuit.“I think the governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and I think we have to take another look at it,” Sanders responded.Front-runner Hillary Clinton also attacked Sanders for his vote. “I voted against it. I was in the Senate at the same time. It wasn't that complicated to me,” Clinton said. “It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America.”Sanders vehemently defends his support for gun control. In addition to expressing an openness to changing the liability law, the senator notes that he supports expanding background checks by closing the so-called gun show loophole among other measures, as well as banning assault weapons.He argues that as a progressive with a D-minus rating from the National Rifle Association who is also from a largely rural state with relatively lax gun laws, he is uniquely positioned to bridge the political divide on gun control.Sanders’ meeting with the Phillipses could give him a chance to improve his standing with gun control proponents. Yet the campaign is already on the defensive regarding its discussions with the Phillipses about the planned meeting.The Phillipses say they first requested a meeting via email on Oct. 8, but did not receive a response until Monday, after the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence issued a press release slamming Sanders for failing to respond. The release included the text of the Phillipses' email to Sanders’ staff. The campaign confirmed that it reached out to the Phillipses on Monday, but would not say why it did not initially respond to the request.Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday joined a push for the Department of Justice to investigate allegations that ExxonMobil hid research confirming fossil fuels contribute significantly to climate change.In a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Sanders accused the oil giant of a ""potential instance of corporate fraud,"" which he added could ""ultimately qualify as a violation of federal law.""""Exxon Mobil knew the truth about fossil fuels and climate change and lied to protect their business model at the expense of the planet,"" Sanders, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, wrote.Last week, two House Democrats sent Lynch a very similar letter, pressing her to launch an investigation into Exxon's actions. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, another Democratic presidential candidate, has also indicated support for an official inquiry. The independent investigations by the two news outlets allege that Exxon shared the data internally and used it when planning future operations, but promoted ""a public policy position that sought to downplay the certainty of global warming."" If this is true, Sanders said, the ""misinformation campaign"" Exxon spread could lead to federal racketeering convictions. ""Based on available public information, it appears that Exxon knew its product was causing harm to the public, and spent millions of dollars to obfuscate the facts in the public discourse,"" Sanders wrote. ""The information that has come to light about Exxon’s past activities raises potentially serious concerns that should be investigated.""Sanders also requested that the DOJ form a task force by Dec. 19 in order to determine whether there is enough evidence to open an official investigation into Exxon. Last week, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said the company ""unequivocally"" rejects the allegations outlined in the articles and letters being sent to Lynch.""Suggestions that ExxonMobil suppressed its climate research are completely without merit,"" Jeffers said."
8,CRIME,Rikers Island Almost Never Reports Sexual Abuse Complaints: Official,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rikers-island-rape-report_us_562673c8e4b0bce3470258d2,"Last year, the prison failed to report 98 percent of sexual abuse complaints.",2015-10-20,A figure from data filed by New York City Public Advocate Letitia James supporting Rikers Island inmates' pursuit of a class-action sexual abuse lawsuit. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5626bcc11200002e007e5957.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rape and sexual abuse of Rikers Island inmates are almost never reported to police, a New York City government watchdog asserts in a new court filing.The office of NYC Public Advocate Letitia James shared troubling figures Monday that suggest Rikers Island has a pervasive sexual abuse problem -- and that officials look the other way when inmates complain about it.The data came from an Oct. 9 affidavit James filed in which she supported the Rikers Island inmates' pursuit of class action status that stems from a lawsuit filed in May by two female prisoners.Rikers Island failed to report to police a staggering 98 percent of sexual abuse complaints last year, James asserts in her Oct. 9 data, citing city health department and corrections department data; of the 116 total complaints made to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, officials only pursued two. ""Sexual violence cannot be tolerated anywhere in our city -- including our jails,"" James said in a statement via email. ""Our affidavit proves the disturbing prevalence of sexual harassment and abuse allegations on Rikers Island.""James called the substantiation rate of the sexual abuse allegations ""shockingly low"" compared to other jurisdictions and said the low rate raises questions about ""access to justice systems for our most vulnerable inmates."" In a May 19 lawsuit, two Jane Doe inmates alleged a horrifying pattern of rape and abuse that they say prison officials were aware of and ignored. The women, one of whom is considered to have ""diminished intellectual capacity,"" allegedly were repeatedly raped and abused by Rikers Island corrections officer Benny Santiago. Santiago allegedly threatened to harm the women's families, subject them to discipline or enlist other inmates to abuse them if they reported him. One of the women alleged Santiago would anally rape her as punishment whenever he was angry with her or jealous. The suit says at least two other guards knew that Santiago was raping Jane Doe 2 and even confronted him, telling him ""what you’re doing isn’t right."" Neither guard reported Santiago's alleged actions to supervisors. When the same victim tried to report him to the prison mental health and medical officials, they told her there was nothing they could do about the abuse. Guards friendly with Santiago consequently harassed her for reporting, according to the suit. In April, James' office sent a petition to the Board of Correction outlining measures aligned with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act that the city's prisons could take to protect female inmates from sexual abuse. PREA guidelines indicate steps state prisons must take in order to receive their certification. Due to a loophole in the law, states only need to report sexual abuse data from the state prisons, effectively exempting municipal jails from scrutiny. ""I have petitioned the Board of Correction to begin formal rule-making to better protect inmates from sexual violence, and they must start tackling this problem with the urgency it deserves,"" James said. In her recent court filing, James yet again cited a grim fact she included in her April petition: According a Justice Department survey, 8.6 percent of the female inmates in the Rose M. Singer Center (Rikers Island's female prison) reported being sexually harassed or abused, compared with 3.2 percent of U.S. jail inmates.The New York City Department of Corrections did not immediately return requests for comment.

Huntsberger told The Washington Post that he met up with Jones shortly after their band, Future Prezidents, finished playing a gig in the town of Jupiter, Florida.After calling for roadside assistance, Huntsberger left at about 2:30 a.m. At some point between then and 3:15 a.m., a plainclothes cop with the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department fatally shot Jones.On Tuesday, Jones' family and friends were still looking for answers. The officer who shot Jones, identified as Nouman Raja, wasn't wearing a body camera at the time, and none of the department's squad cars have dashboard cameras, according to CBS News.The department didn't return calls for comment, but issued a statement on its Facebook page -- since removed -- saying that Raja thought he was approaching an abandoned vehicle.""Nouman Raja, on duty in a plain clothes capacity, in an unmarked police vehicle, stopped to investigate what he believed to be an abandoned vehicle.

They gathered at Bible Church of God in Boynton Beach, where Jones' grandfather serves as a bishop, to mourn him on Monday.""We’re really numb right now, just trying to understand what happened,"" said Jones' cousin, Remus Johnson, according to the Palm Beach Post.""He grew up on the drums over there. We taught him a few things about life and about being a gentleman. We really just need to get more information,"" said Jones' uncle, Kenneth Terry Banks.Those close to Jones said he may have indeed had a gun and a permit, but that he wouldn't have used it unless he felt threatened.

In a San Francisco federal court on Monday, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg said the scope of his betrayal was ""breathtaking.""U.S. prosecutors had requested an 87-month prison sentence, while Force's attorneys asked for a four year sentence.Force's attorneys said he deserved less time partly because of mental health issues. In court on Monday, Force apologized to the American people, and to his family.""I'm sorry, I lost it and I don't understand a lot of it,"" Force said.Silk Road operated for more than two years until it was shut down in October 2013, generating more than $214 million in sales of drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoins, prosecutors said. Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road's creator who authorities say used the alias ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" was sentenced to life in prison in May after a federal jury in Manhattan found him guilty of several charges, including distributing drugs through the Internet.Prosecutors also reached a plea agreement with Shaun Bridges, a former Secret Service agent who was charged along with Force in March with stealing bitcoins, the web-based digital currency, during the investigation.Force and Bridges belonged to a Baltimore-based federal task force that investigated Silk Road. Force played a prominent role, communicating with Ulbricht while posing as a drug dealer named ""Nob,"" prosecutors said.According to a government document, Force, operating as ""Nob,"" in August 2013 convinced Ulbricht to pay him $50,000 in bitcoins by pretending he had information on the investigation.While Force reported the discussion to the DEA, he falsely claimed no payment had been made but instead diverted the bitcoins to a personal account, prosecutors said.Force, also without authorities' knowledge, used another online moniker, ""French Maid,"" and offered Ulbricht information on the investigation for about $98,000 in bitcoins in September 2013, prosecutors said.(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Reese)MORE ON HUFFPOST:What You Should Know About The 'Dark Web,' An Anonymous Haven For Hackers"
13,TECH,Get Ready To Stand In Line At The Department of Drone Vehicles,Alexander Howard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drone-registry-faa-transportation_us_56252b3ce4b08589ef4842f6,The feds announced a plan to require recreational drone operators to register their devices with the government.,2015-10-20,The plan is to have a national drone registry in place by Christmas.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56256e991400002200c7a50e.jpeg?cache=WsFkcbpojm&ops=crop_69_234_2909_1497%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"If you operate a drone, Uncle Sam wants to know your name. The Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration announced a speedy new plan to require all drones to be registered by their operators, whether they're used for commercial, media, research, aid or recreational purposes.Monday's news from Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and FAA Administrator Michael Huerta follows an increase in reports of near-misses involving drones around airports and of interference with public safety workers.It also sets an aggressive schedule: The plan is to have the registry in place by the holidays, when the FCC expects over 1 million drones to be sold.Originally, the registry was part of a notice of proposed rule-making that was published in the Federal Register this spring. Those rules are still on track to be finalized by June of next year. In Monday's press conference, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx compared the drone registry to regulation of off-road vehicles. ""It may be OK to operate an off-road vehicle without registering it if you are using it on your own property,"" he said. ""But if you intend to take it onto local streets or the highway, you are expected to register it and operate it safely to protect the public."" The new plan clarifies that unmanned aircraft, like manned aircraft, must be registered with the federal government. Foxx said this is ""essential to ensuring accountability and is an important part of our ongoing vigilance,"" as it will help the government enforce safety rules by identifying the operators who break them.Public officials and other experts suggested that Monday's announcement was driven by the rising number of civilian drone interactions with commercial aviation and with local government agencies responding to emergencies -- in California, Texas and New York, among other states. One such example occurred in Wimberley, Texas, where drones were used in searches related to Memorial Day flooding. Gene Robinson, the owner of Texas-based drone manufacturer RP Flight Systems, which works with law enforcement and emergency response agencies, said there were also ""a lot of people out flying in our area, in temporary flight restriction zones, that were not authorized. That's a problem if you need to bring in a Lifeline helicopter or a plane to dump water. You just can't have that.""Demby said that ""drone protocol 1"" was to ""defer to manned aircraft no matter what, to the point of ditching the craft. Unfortunately, a lot of people who are not educated in operations of emergency flights and first responders don't understand this.""Drones are also interfering with first responders on the ground -- as seen in this video, in which a fire department uses its hose to get a drone to back away from a burning residence in New York (about the 12-minute mark).As more people buy and use drones, the incidence of drone sightings and close encounters appears to be growing.""A lot of people don't recognize that they're not just buying a toy,"" said Lisa Ellman, co-chair of the unmanned aircraft systems practice at the international law firm Hogan Lovells. ""It is very hard to enforce law if you don't know who is flying. It is not OK to fly if you are recklessly endangering the public."" The planned national registry will likely hit some turbulence before Christmas. Drone operators, members of the fast-growing drone industry and legal advocates will surely raise concerns about feasibility, privacy and civil liberties. Foxx said a task force of government regulators and industry stakeholders is being established to work out the details.It will need to figure out which drones truly are toys and which ones need to be registered. It will have to determine how to create the registry: Since people can build drones at home, requiring registration at the point of sale won't be enough.Online communities like DIYDrones.com and improvements in 3D printers have rapidly advanced the ability of hundreds of thousands of people to build their own drones, instead of buying them off the shelf.""The only way to regulate this is to regulate the parts,"" said E.J. Duarte, the owner of Thurst UAV, a small drone manufacturer. But even then, he suggested, ""It's almost impossible. Tons of people are building the [mother]boards at their houses.""The feds also plan to require retroactive registration by people who already have drones. Meanwhile, the FAA and the Transportation Department have received more than 4,500 public comments on the broader rule-making, which they are reading through, Foxx said. The plan is to issue a final version of those rules in June 2016. He noted that he had already signed off on roughly 2,000 exemptions for some commercial operations.The proposed rules will not require a license for drone operators, but besides registering the drone, operators will have to pay for and take a knowledge test to receive a certificate, be vetted by the Transportation Security Administration, and obey some basic operating limitations, including adhering to national no-fly zones. The federal government does not always issue rules in a timely fashion. But Ellman, who previously served in the White House Office of Management and Budget between 2011 and 2013, expects this regulatory process to move along quickly because the perceived need is so strong."

When he expressed his reservations to Obama in 2008, the then-senator was quick to ease his concerns.""I've spent my whole life setting myself up so I could tell anybody I wanted to go fuck themselves. And I've walked out of campaigns and work situations when I thought that it wasn't right. And I said 'you can't say that to the president of the United States,'"" Axelrod said he told Obama.Obama then told Axelrod why he believed he should come to Washington with him, and then reassured him that he wouldn't have to censor himself.""You can tell me to fuck myself, just don't do it in front of anybody else,"" he said.Axelrod first met Obama in 1992 and actually tried to talk him out of running for the U.S. Senate in 2004. After Obama won the presidency, Axelrod served as a senior adviser until 2011, when he left the White House to work on president Obama's re-election bid.Axelrod didn't elaborate in the interview whether he ever actually told Obama to go fuck himself in the White House.H/T BuzzFeedAlso on HuffPost:"
