The NFL has reached out to Michael Sam. Both milestones made American sports history. The first-team All-American defensive lineman from the University of Missouri became the first openly gay player ever drafted into the NFL when the St. Louis Rams selected him with the 249th pick in the seventh round of the 2014 draft. Sam, the 2013 SEC Co-Defensive Player of the Year, waited until the eighth-to-last selection to hear his name called at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on Saturday.In a powerful scene broadcast by ESPN after his selection was announced, Sam could be seen overcome with emotion as he received a phone call from Rams coach Jeff Fisher. As he celebrated the historic moment, Sam shared an embrace and kiss with his boyfriend. (STORY CONTINUES BELOW)WATCH: Michael Sam Reacts To Being Drafted By The RamsThe 24-year-old from Hitchcock, Texas announced that he was gay in February in interviews with The New York Times and ESPN. He told both media outlets that he came out to his teammates during a preseason football practice before the Tigers' 2013 campaign. Sam went on to lead the SEC in sacks (11.5) and tackles for a loss (19) as Missouri roared to a 12-2 record. ""I understand how big this is,"" Sam told ESPN in February. ""It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.""Listed at at 6' 2"" and 261 pounds, Sam's draft stock took a hit after a lackluster performance in the drills at the NFL Scouting Combine, including the 40-yard dash, vertical leap and bench press. He improved upon his performances during a subsequent workout at Missouri but concerns about his size, strength and true NFL position persisted as the draft approached. As the third day of the draft progressed, many following along on Twitter worried that his size and speed weren't the only things keeping him from being drafted earlier.Whether or not other teams passed on Sam for reasons other than football, the Rams potentially secured one of the best values of the draft by landing such an accomplished player so late. Before Sam was selected in the seventh round, only one other SEC Defensive Player of the Year had failed to be selected by the 33rd overall selection. The award was first bestowed upon LSU's Chad Lavalais in 2003 and he was selected with the 142nd overall pick in the fifth round of the 2004 draft. ""Mike is going to come in here,"" Fisher told ESPN's Suzy Kolber after the draft concluded. ""He's a good football player and that's the bottom line.""  Once the Rams, who were also the team to break the NFL's modern-era color barrier in 1946, selected Sam, several players already on the team were among those offering their support on Twitter. Welcome to #STL @MikeSamFootball !! Teammates again.Sam's milestone selection in the NFL draft was the latest historic moment for a gay athlete. In February, Brooklyn Nets center Jason Collins became the first openly gay player in NBA history. In May 2013, Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder Robbie Rogers became the first openly gay player in MLS history. In 2014, Sam could become the first openly gay athlete to play in an NFL game.""Without a doubt, this is a game changer,"" GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. ""Today, Michael Sam has redefined what it takes to be a champion. He's tackled stereotypes and joins the ranks of athletic trailblazers like Jason Collins and Brittney Griner in showing Americans that there's no place for homophobia on the field. As support for equality continues to surge, it's clear that sports fans are ready, football is ready, and America is ready for its first openly gay NFL player.""In his first tweet after being drafted, Sam pledged to make the most of his opportunity.

Bass called the comments ""disturbing and offensive."" (AP Photo/Mark J.

In the latest recording purportedly of a conversation involving Sterling to be made public, the banned owner of the Los Angeles Clippers allegedly offered an unlikely excuse for his racist remarks. A man identified as Sterling in the audio that was released by Radar Online on Friday morning can be heard telling a friend that he made his infamous racist statements to V. Stiviano out of lust rather than hate. “You know, if you were trying to have sex with a girl, and you don’t think anybody’s there, you might say anything in the world. What difference does it make?

In that recording, Sterling told her not bring black friends to Clippers games or share photographs of herself with black friends on Instagram. The recording sparked national outrage and led to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banning Sterling for life from the NBA and slapping him with a $2.5 million fine. During a press conference held to announce those punishments, Silver also made it clear that he would urge the league's 29 other owners to force Sterling to sell the Clippers.“At the appropriate time, I’ll express what my thoughts and my feelings and what my heart says, OK?” Sterling told the News on Friday."

4,QUEER VOICES,This Man Could Be The First Southern Elected Official To Allow Gay Couples To Wed,Lila Shapiro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-gay-marriage_n_5298155.html,,2014-05-10,"In this Friday July 20, 2012 photo, Carol Anastosio and Mimi Brown's hold hands in New York.

(AP Photo/ Fay Abuelgasim)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafc70f250000cf0037f6e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Editors Note: When this article was reported, a judge in Arkansas had not yet struck down that state's ban on same-sex marriage. On Saturday when this article was published, news that the state had issued licenses had not yet reached our editors. So while it is no longer the case that Mark Chilton could be the first Southern elected official to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple, The Huffington Post has left the article as it was originally written.  Since last June, the Campaign for Southern Equality, an LGBT advocacy group based in North Carolina, has contacted marriage license offices in more than 600 counties across the South, asking elected officials there if they would be willing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, despite their state's ban on these unions. Less than a dozen replies came in, and they spanned the political spectrum from those who pledged their support for marriage equality and said they looked forward to issuing licenses as soon as the laws had changed, to those who said ""you should go read your Bible differently,"" said Rev. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, the director of the campaign. None of the officials agreed to begin issuing licenses. But that trend is now poised to change.This week Mark Chilton, a real estate attorney and former North Carolina mayor, won a primary election to become the next register of deeds of Orange County, North Carolina. (Chilton, a Democrat, is as of now unopposed for the Nov. 2 election.) Earlier this year, Chilton pledged that if elected, he would immediately begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. His two primary opponents, for their part, said that they would not issue licenses because the action would violate their oath of office. Two years ago, North Carolina voters passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Even so, Chilton does not see his decision to marry same-sex couples as a violation of his oath of office. ""The North Carolina constitution spells out our oath of office as elected officials, and it says our number one responsibility -- number one -- is to uphold the U.S. Constitution, even when the U.S. Constitution contradicts the North Carolina constitution."" Since last June, when the Supreme Court struck down the section of the Defense of Marriage Act that banned the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, a string of federal court rulings from around the country have found states' same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional. Although several lawsuits challenging North Carolina's law are now winding through the courts, none have reached resolution. And Chilton is not content to sit around and wait.""Until some court does rule on that, it's in the hands of our local county governments to make the best decision they can reasonably make and that's what I'm doing,"" Chilton said. If Chilton does begin issuing licenses in January, when he is expected to take office, he will join a line of other elected officials who have taken similar stands in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and other states. In 2004, then-San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom famously ordered county clerks to issue licenses to around 4,000 same-sex couples, eventually leading to a landmark ruling from the California Supreme Court in 2008 that legalized same-sex marriage throughout the state. (Same-sex marriage in California was banned again, later that same year, by Proposition 8, a law overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court last June.)Beach-Ferrara hopes that Chilton's position represents a turning point in the fight for marriage equality in the South. Over the last several years, she has been traveling the South with gay and lesbian couples who wish to get married, and stood witness as these couples have approached their local courthouses or register of deeds office, requested a license and been rejected. Prior to Chilton, the most promising response came from another North Carolina register of deeds who agreed to begin accepting marriage license applications while he sought clarity from the state's attorney general on whether he might grant the licenses. However, Attorney General Roy Cooper informed the register of deeds that issuing the licenses would be in violation of the law, and the licenses were never granted.""We've seen growing numbers of LGBT people being ready to take these actions, so seeing elected officials taking a similar stand is very powerful,"" Beach-Ferrara said. ""We're hopeful that others will be inspired by Mr. Chilton and follow this same course of action."""

Even though they've since split--or, rather, ""consciously uncoupled""-- this song still pulls at the heartstrings nine years later. ""Chicago,"" Sufjan Stevens ""Chicago"" isn't a straightforward love song by any means, but this ode to winging a cross-country road trip will flood your memory with all sorts of teenage nostalgia. ""Devils & Dust,"" Bruce SpringsteenSpringsteen wrote this song from the perspective of a soldier serving in the Iraq War, but the acoustic period track is still a soulful listen nine years later. ""Since U Been Gone,"" Kelly Clarkson Music snobs can deny all they want, but everyone is guilty of belting out ""Since U Been Gone"" in the comfort of their own cars. We may be so over our exes thanks to this breakup anthem, but we're definitely not over the karaoke gem itself.

He remembers trips to the park. He smiles and laughs at memories of her joining him on a basketball court, chasing down his makes and misses then passing the ball back to him.Those were the good times, which lasted until he was 6.Then came the bad times, when Paulette George's days of doing ""all the normal stuff a mom does"" came to a crashing halt. Two blood clots triggered a stroke, leaving her practically bedridden for two years and paralyzed on her left side to this day.Paul sees those scenes clearly, too.""I remember every moment of it,"" he said. ""I was always there on hospital visits, right by her bed. When she got a hospital bed in our home, I would lay in my bed right next to her. I was there. I saw all of it.""On Sunday, on Mother's Day, Paul and the Indiana Pacers will take on the Washington Wizards in a playoff game. Paulette will watch eagerly, perhaps even taking a moment to connect the dots on how far each of them have come in their own struggles.NBA All-Star Paul George (right) with his mom, Paulette, and dad, PaulFueled by her family's love and patience, Paulette persevered to forge a new life as a stroke survivor. She's proven that this terrible disease -- the fourth-leading killer of Americans and a leading cause of adult disability -- is treatable and beatable. Now she's sharing her story to inspire others.Paul is among those she's already inspired. A late-bloomer physically, he faced naysayers and doubters throughout his rise to the NBA, ultimately pulling off the rare feat of being hailed as an elite talent only after arriving at the highest level of his sport.Last year, he made the All-Star team for the first time and won the league's Most Improved Player Award. This year, he not only returned to the All-Star Game, he was the captain of the Eastern Conference team. More importantly, he's the best player on one of the NBA's best teams, a status validated recently by the Pacers giving him a contract for the most years and dollars allowed by league rules.""I've always been underrated, and that always drove me to stay in the gym, to work hard and to continue to push myself the same way my mom had to fight through her adversity,"" he said. ""Whenever I feel like I've had a bad day, I think about my mom and it just strengthens me. I've got to keep going hard for my momma.""Paulette was a fit, active, stay-at-home mom when her world came crashing down at age 37. What started with a headache-like pain on the right side of her head turned into several hours of vomiting. Then came a tingling sensation that rose from her toes to her knees to her arms until she was totally paralyzed.""I could look at people, but that was the most I could do,"" she said. ""I lost everything.""Confused over the source of her problems, a doctor gave her less than 24 hours to live. Eventually, doctors discovered the culprit: stroke.Nearly 800,000 people have a stroke each year, and stroke kills someone about every four minutes. Although Paulette had under control major risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol, African-Americans have nearly twice the risk for a first-ever stroke than white people, and a much higher death rate from stroke.Recovery was long and slow. Their house in Palmdale, California, became like a hospital room, with a bed, wheelchair and commode chair. Paulette couldn't speak or do much for herself, yet being home -- surrounded by family -- made her feel safe.""Happiness is medicine, too,"" she said.Daughters Portala and Teiosha did much of the household duty, with Paul pitching in where he could. Eating dinner at the table, seated in her wheelchair and using her one good hand, was a milestone. Ditching the wheelchair for a walking cane was even bigger. ""It's been emotional, depressing, because I'm not the way I used to be and I can't do the things I used to,"" Paulette said. ""But I've learned my limitations. I know what I can do, what I can take, my exhaustion level. I try to deal with life as it is. I have that will to fight.""With his career taking off, 24-year-old Paul is eager to share his fame with his mom, giving her a larger platform to spread awareness on how to prevent and beat stroke. That's what led them to the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association.At the NBA All-Star Game, it was Paul's idea for the American Heart Association to be among two beneficiaries of the East's prize money from the Saturday night skills challenges; buoyed by his performance in the dunk contest, the squad earned $500,000. Paul and Paulette also will soon be teaming on a public-service announcement with the American Stroke Association through the Ad Council.Sharing their story now is timely, as May is American Stroke Month, a time to encourage learning the warning signs F.A.S.T. -- Face drooping, Arm Weakness or Speech difficulty means it is Time to call 9-1-1.""She always tells me that she really would love to do something big, and I want to make it happen,"" Paul said. ""Telling her testimony of what she's been through is really her passion. I feel like she was put in a position to be able to use her voice, and I want to be an extension of her voice to really get that out there.""Each of them have a wonderful story worth celebrating this Mother's Day. Add in the joys provided by Paul's sisters, and there's even more for the Georges to savor.""The harder you work, the better it gets,"" Paulette said. ""The happiest part of all is that we're always together as a family -- and that I'm still here and blessed to enjoy all that."""

8,HEALTHY LIVING,Expectant Mother's Day Dreams,"DreamsCloud, ContributorThe most comprehensive dream resource and community for dreami...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/expecting-mothers-day-dre_b_5282486.html,,2014-05-09,2014-05-07-shutterstock_46092664_dreamscloud_pregnant_dreams.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-07-shutterstock_46092664_dreamscloud_pregnant_dreams-thumb.jpg,"By Dr. Angel Morgan via DreamsCloudExpecting mothers can have dreams that are very sweet about their children before they are born. Sometimes, mothers even have dreams that inform the naming of their children. For example, while I was round with my first pregnancy, I had a vivid dream of a little toddler with curly golden hair, running in a forest with a pack of wolves. Not running from them... running with them. In fact, she was vivaciously leading the group of wolves through the forest. The wolves were clearly her family, her pack. When I awoke from this dream, I had the feeling my child had given me her middle name. I honored this dream by giving my daughter her middle name, Goldenwolf. Since there are many different kinds of dreams, of course this is also true for dreams of pregnant mothers. Often dreams during pregnancy aren't so sweet, loving, or mystical in the mother's experience. For example, it's common for expecting moms to have strange and fearful dreams about baby animals, or babies of all shapes and sizes, sometimes even appearing more like grotesque monsters. It's natural for a mom to feel concerned with the health and appearance of a not-yet-born child, but that doesn't mean she is carrying a baby seal, bunny, kitty, or baby with 20 toes! These kinds of dreams usually represent more about her feelings of the unknown and are very normal during pregnancy. Most of her dreams are going to be filled with symbols, puns and metaphors, whether they are strange and grotesque, or simply exploring her feelings about everything that is happening in her waking life while expecting a child. Some common themes experienced by expecting mothers are: small, furry, cute animals, water (amniotic fluid/womb), architecture (uterus), and fertility symbols such as lush gardens with flowers, fruits, and vegetables. In addition to dreams about the name of a child, sometimes expecting moms have dreams about the sex of the child. Interestingly, in my dream with the toddler running with wolves in the forest, I didn't see whether my child was going to be a girl or a boy yet -- I waited until her birth to find out my ""Goldenwolf"" child was a girl.Elements from the past are active in pregnancy dreams too. For example, it's common for first time pregnant mothers to dream about their own mothers as they're preparing to form their own maternal identities. During my first pregnancy, I often had lucid dreams of evaporating bodies of water so I could see what artifacts from the past I would find underneath all that ""mother water!"" Although this isn't exclusive, when people dream about snow and ice, those dreams are sometimes about unresolved mother, or motherhood issues (frozen/cold ""mother water""). In those kinds of dreams, I have focused on the warm sun melting the snow or ice to see what has been ""frozen"" underneath. When a mother watches her sleeping baby, she will notice his or her closed eyelids often flutter rapidly. That means the baby is experiencing REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, and is probably dreaming. Unfortunately, we can't know for sure what babies' dreams are like because when they report dreams to us, it is usually in Gummish (baby language). Some mothers claim to speak Gummish, but scientists remain skeptical. Most moms simply enjoy the feeling these ""dream reports"" give them... especially when they are in a blissful baby bubble. Children have been known to share dreams as soon as they can talk, but usually, they start to speak about dreams when they are around age 3 or 4. Expecting and new mothers have plenty of time to learn more about dreams, continue regular use of a dream journal, increase their dream education, and find reliable sources to help them understand and connect with the world of dreams. Engaging in this process will help new moms develop a reverence for their own dream experiences, so they can better understand the importance of their children's dreams when they start sharing them with their sweet mama.DreamsCloud is a place to log and share your dreams, keep an online dream journal, learn more about dream meanings and receive professional dream reflections.

9,RELIGION,Cardinal: Boko Haram Has Shamed Nigeria,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cardinal-boko-haram_n_5282483.html,,2014-05-09,"Women attend a demonstration calling on government to rescue kidnapped school girls of a government secondary school Chibok, during workers day celebration in Lagos, Nigeria. Thursday, May, 1. 2014, Scores of girls and young women kidnapped from a school in Nigeria are being forced to marry their Islamic extremist abductors, a civic organization reported Wednesday. At the same time, the Boko Haram terrorist network is negotiating over the students' fate and is demanding an unspecified ransom for their release, a Borno state community leader told The Associated Press. He said the Wednesday night message from the abductors also claimed that two of the girls have died from snake bites. The message was sent to a member of a presidential committee mandated last year to mediate a ceasefire with the Islamic extremists, said the civic leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about the talks.

We cannot explain what is happening.”Vatican Radio reported that at least 53 of the girls had escaped from their captors but 276 were still believed to be in captivity.The girls were abducted by heavily armed Muslim militants from a boarding school in the northern town of Chibok three weeks ago, provoking outrage around the world and offers of assistance from the U.S. There were also reports that 11 other girls were kidnapped from a second school Tuesday (May 6).Onaiyekan said the Nigerian people were baffled by the government’s inability to locate the girls.“We know that Boko Haram have no sense of humanity,” he said. “We know that they are killing innocent people. But that they should be able to cart away almost 300 schoolchildren in the northeast of Nigeria without any trace of where these children are really baffles us.”Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau on Monday (May 5) released a video in which he threatened to sell the girls and abduct more children from other schools. The extremist group’s murderous rampages against “Western” education and the military’s failure to rescue the kidnapped girls and young women have generated widespread protests in major cities in Nigeria and across the world.“Our president seems to be impotent,” the cardinal said. “We need to see action.”Onaiyekan said that while many schools had closed due to the threat of attack by militants, this most recent incident took place at a school that had temporarily reopened to allow the girls the opportunity to complete their final exams in a secure environment."
