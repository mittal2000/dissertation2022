What doesn't yoga deliver? In case the mere promises of spiritual enlightenment and party trick-worthy flexibility aren't enough to get you on the mat, what about the lures of reversed aging, feeling good in spandex and exuding confidence on the Big Day? Enlightenment AND a yoga butt? Yes, please. Slap a cucumber slice onto that puffy third eye and prepare to feel relaxed, vibrant and healthy with a few simple poses. Bridge Pose Lie on your back with knees bent and feet on the floor. Bring knees and feet hip-distance apart, and place hands palm-up at your sides. Lift your hips and continue lifting up the spine until you reach the base of the neck. Rock your shoulders underneath you to interlace the hands under your back. Press the hands and arms into the mat as you continue to lift your hips. Hold for five breaths, releasing the hands and lowering the spine down top to bottom, one vertebra at a time. Repeat, hugging knees to chest when finished.Benefits: Tones butt and thighs, fights cellulite, corrects posture and supports a healthy spine.Pigeon  Begin on your hands and knees. Slide your right knee to the back of your right wrist, bringing your right foot to the front of your left knee. Straighten your left leg behind you, sliding it back until you come to rest on the top of your left thigh. Your right heel should now rest between your left writst and left hip. Hold yourself up with straight arms as pictured to add a gentle backbend, or walk your hands forward and rest on forearms or forehead. This pose can be held for a few breaths to several minutes. Repeat on opposite side.Benefits: Can improve sex by increasing flexibility and range of motion of the hips, boosts circulation in the groin area, provides deep relaxation and stress relief.Shoulder Stand Lie on back with feet on the floor about hip-distance apart, arms along sides of body. Bend knees in toward chest, and roll hips up and over as you straighten your legs. Feet should be aiming over your head. Place hands on lower back for support with fingertips pointing up, elbows on the ground, and straighten your legs upward. Hold for 10 breaths. Slowly release the back onto floor one vertebra at a time. Follow with Fish Pose.Benefits: Increases circulation to enhance radiance, provides energy boost, eliminates bloating and swelling, regulates sleep. Fish pose Lie on your back with your legs straight and palms facing down by your side. Arch your back to raise it off the ground by pushing elbows into the floor. Tilt your head backwards until the crown of your head rests on the floor. Use your forearms and elbows to support you, allowing only a minimal amount of weight on the head. Taking an underbite here can deepen the throat stretch. Hold for five to ten breaths.Benefits: Prevents and reduces a double chin, provides lengthening effect to neck, counters curvature of the upper spine, contributes to healthy thyroid and metabolism.Legs up the Wall Sitting on the floor with your left hip against a wall, roll onto your back to bring legs straight up the wall and your back to the ground. The backs of your legs and butt should be flush with the wall. Gently flex the feet. Hold up to five minutes. You can even take this as your savasana, or final resting pose.Benefits: Reduces premature aging, relieves insomnia and jet lag, prevents and lessens varicose veins, reduces water retention in ankles and feet.While you may feel ready to skip down the aisle after just one round of the above postures, results will increase with a dedicated practice. Check with your doctor before starting this or any new fitness regimen, and work with a certified yoga instructor (ahem) to safely perform these postures. When your future mother-in-law asks what you're doing to look so good, just wink at her with your third eye.Photography credit: Raftermen Photography"

Just about anything oozing with melted cheese tastes delicious -- like melted mozzarella on a pizza; sweet, nutty asiago in a luscious mac and cheese; or earthy fontina in a sinful fondue.But perhaps the simplest recipe -- the most adored of all -- is the grilled cheese sandwich. When prepared with a crusty bread and stuffed with a cheese that melts to perfection, it is essentially irresistible.Here, this beloved sandwich takes on a gourmet twist. The secret ingredient: garlic confit!When garlic is gently poached in olive oil, it becomes sweet, with a subtle flavor. The cloves become so soft that you can spread them on your toast -- or in this case, in your grilled cheese sandwich.Pair the mellow garlic confit with zingy baby arugula and a nutty, pungent aged cheddar, gruyère or fontina, and every luscious bite is mouthwatering.Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Garlic Confit and Baby Arugulaserves 4 active time: 30 min8 thin slices rye country bread 1/4 cup olive oil from Garlic Confit 8 oz (225 g) aged Cheddar, Gruyère, Fontina or Manchego - coarsely grated 2 large handfuls baby arugula (4 oz) (115 g) 1/2 cup Garlic Confit cloves sea salt to taste freshly ground black pepper to tasteStep 1: Place four slices of bread on a cutting board and brush with the olive oil reserved from the garlic confit. Turn slices around and spread the grated cheese on the non-oiled side. Top each slice with a heap of the baby arugula. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Spread the garlic confit on the other four slices of bread. Place the garlic confit slices on top of the slices with the arugula and press firmly to seal the sandwiches. Brush the top of the sandwiches with the balance of the oil.Step 2: Heat a large heavy-bottomed frying pan to medium-high heat. Add the sandwiches, reduce heat to medium/medium-high, and sauté four to five minutes until golden-brown. Flip the sandwiches and continue to sauté for three to four minutes until golden-brown and the cheese has melted completely. Serve piping hot!"

Here are the top ten tips every newly engaged woman needs to read.",2013-04-30,Wedding album or writing book with two blank instant-photo prints laid on bridal lace with several silver wedding gifts and white rose bouquet (paths provided).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1a451f00005100217a6e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With so much advice flying around, sometimes a bride-to-be just needs someone to boil it down for her. Here are the top ten tips every newly engaged woman needs to read, inspired by the speakers at Bridal Rebellion, a workshop in New York City earlier this month that brought together close to 30 wedding experts from around the country. 1. Do not make any decisions before you have a clearly defined wedding budget. When you're on such a high following your engagement, you're probably not in the mood to have serious talks about finances with your fiancé and whoever else is helping pay for your wedding. But you must figure out what your total budget is, and you must decide which items you want to save on, and where you're willing to splurge. A rule of thumb for big savings is to be flexible about your wedding date, says Kim Forrest, an editor at WeddingWire. Venues are less expensive in the off-season months, and for non-Saturday night weddings. And think outside the box if you want to save on your venue. Historic homes, farms, and even schools and libraries can offer charming spaces at lower cost, according to Jessica Bishop of The Budget Savvy Bride. Forrest also recommends saving money by wearing borrowed jewelry. ""Wearing something borrowed from a good friend or family member is more special anyway,"" she said. However, when it comes to looking out for your guests' comfort, go ahead and splurge. ""Make sure you're choosing a venue that is large enough for everyone, and comfortable."" Forrest said. 2. When inviting your bridesmaids, ask nicely! This may sound obvious, but lots of brides-to-be wrongly assume that their friends will obviously accept. ""There are legitimate reasons why someone might have to decline,"" says Carrie Mantha, co-founder of Indira, who is about to be a bridesmaid for the 18th time. Another rule of thumb when it comes to bridesmaids is this: Be clear from the outset about your expectations, and make sure everyone is happy with their roles. ""If you're all starting out on the same page, the entire process is more likely to be totally stress-free,"" Mantha advises. It's also important to include your bridesmaids in the fun parts of the planning process, like dress shopping and even cake tasting. Don't just stick them with the dirty work! And most of all, don't make everything about you all the time. ""Continue to pay attention to their lives,"" Mantha said.3. First, brand your wedding; second, pull your themes from that brand. What does it mean to ""brand"" your wedding? It means, ""finding your common thread"" as a couple, according to Tami Brooks, the founder of Tam Aura Designs. In other words, start your planning process by figuring out what it is you want your wedding to reveal about you as a couple. What is it that defines you? Is it your love of travel? Of golf? Of literature? From that core, or brand, you then pull your themes, Brooks advises. ""You turn your story into color, texture, music, and food, so your guests begin to understand you as a couple, and to get to know something about you during the wedding,"" she said. An important note: Not every element of your wedding needs a theme; that is overkill. Brooks suggests finding at most five strong themes and developing them well.4. If you're hiring a planner, date a little before you pick the one. ""Schedule a date with your prospective planner, and get to know her first,"" advises Fallon Carter, founder of Fallon Carter Weddings. Avoid planners who talk about their own weddings all the time, and stick with the ones who show they're truly listening to you, Carter said. Let the planner choose where you're going to meet for your date; if the place is the complete opposite of your personality, even though you've already told her about yourself on the phone, then this is probably not the planner for you. ""If your relationship doesn't start out well, it probably won't get better,"" Carter said.  5. When it comes to choosing your gown, be willing to push the envelope a little, but don't change who you are. ""Look like you!"" says Hayley Paige, the Head Designer at Haley Paige Bridal. Also, be honest with yourself about what you want, and don't feel constrained by tradition. ""Give yourself exactly what you want in that moment. Being on trend with what you like is always fun and fresh,"" Paige said. And whatever you do, don't panic about not finding the right dress. Paige advises brides-to-be to have faith and patience in the process. ""Just as you did with finding your groom. Your dress is out there looking for you as much as you are looking for it,"" she said.6. Hiring your baker might not be the biggest decision you'll make, but an amazing cake can truly make your wedding, according to Amy Noelle, the founder of Sugar Flower Cake Shop. You can maximize your chances of getting a cake that looks amazing and tastes good by properly interviewing your prospective bakers. Noelle offers three essential questions every bride must ask. First, ask the baker how far in advance she will bake your cake, and if she'll freeze it then thaw it out. If she doesn't look absolutely horrified when you say that, move on to the next baker. Also ask about how she'll transport your cake to the wedding, and what precautions she'll take with it. And third, ask the baker to tell you his war stories. If he doesn't have any, either he's hiding something or he's not very experienced. ""This is the most important question you can ask,"" Noelle said. ""It will reveal what the baker is capable of.""7. Decide from the outset how ""green"" your wedding is going to be. A wedding in the United States produces on average 400 pounds of garbage, according to Kate Harrison, the founder of Green Bride Guide. And if every wedding in a given year used a disposable aisle runner, they would circle the globe twice, she added. ""This doesn't mean you all must have a hippie, vegan, burlap wedding,"" Harrison said. You can choose even just one or two ways to show your concern for the environment. ""Green is not a theme, green is an approach,"" Harrison said.8. If you're hiring a DJ, make sure he speaks clearly, enunciates well, and above all, that he can pronounce your names correctly. ""When meeting with a DJ, pay attention to how he speaks,"" said DJ Nick Ferrington, of Beat Train Productions. If your name is hard to pronounce, have him practice it in front of your.9. Register for gifts you actually need and want. Are you already living together? Don't need dozens of towels? Get to know the alternative gift registries that are flourishing online, advises Brittany Hass, the founder of Happily Ever Borrowed and a wedding technology expert. From honeymoon registries to down payments on your home, there is something for everyone. Be careful, though, not to let the process become anonymous just because the registry is online. ""You still need to individually thank all your guests, even if you're using an alternative registry,"" said Hana Abiza, the CEO and founder of Republic, Inc.10. Have fun while you're engaged! Don't let the stress of planning a wedding control your life, and take note of all the wonderful things that are making you happy along the way. ""Find your 'muchness',"" says Tova Gold, the founder of Finding My Muchness. That is, tune in to all the things that make you tick and make you smile while you're planning your wedding, and make little notes to yourself. That way, you can go back and see that it wasn't all stress!"
3,TRAVEL,In Support of 'Not Quite' Sustainable Travel,"Aaron Winston Smith, Contributor
Founder, Holidays for Humanity",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sustainable-travel_us_5b9d1a46e4b03a1dcc847a4d,"If we want true wholesale change, we must give merit to those that have earned it, but we must also support those that are trying, especially in these difficult economic times.",2013-04-30,The beautiful Cascade du Ray Pic in the Ardeche region in southern France.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1a462200005600d97e54.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I've had the good fortune of globetrotting, much of it however, was spent (checklist in hand) performing hotel and resort site inspections. I was looking to identify properties that met a 'triple bottom line', while managing to deliver high quality guest experiences. From Zanzibar to Tamarindo, and seemingly all points in between, I would spend an average of 1-2 nights in back kitchens, front houses, my head stuck inside waste bins, and my eyes stuck reviewing the hiring process' at more properties than I will ever recall.  I was damn thorough. I had a take no prisoners attitude, and a comprehensive checklist of grading criteria in my holster with the safety set to off. I've seen it all. I've snuck into rooms and alleys that were so completely out of bounds my life would have been in danger. I've been lied to, green-washed, and threatened physically. I've also been inspired, grateful and heart-broken; and I've seen every shade of green from the washed-out, to the vibrantly pure. But it was in this exploratory process that I changed as a person. I formed a deeper understanding of the industry, the operational challenges, and perhaps surprisingly (at least to me), I came out the other side with an appreciation, and a commitment to support those 'not green enough'. That's right, I said 'not green enough'.Now let me start with what I looked for at the time.Being holistically focused, I looked for properties that were operating under core philosophies of social empowerment, environmental stewardship, and financial prudence -- the basis for the aforementioned 'triple bottom line'. I wanted to be impressed by true sustainability, and not just green ribbons on tar-stained birthday presents. Among the list of things I looked for, were where the food orders were coming in from, what detergent was being used in the laundry room, where their electricity originated, their waste terminated, how did they engage with their in-destination communities, and if locals (especially women) held positions of authority. These are all equally important factors in my book, as every choice has both a network, and a life cycle of impacts. No property ever scored 100, but I'm happy to say that I did find places that came close. In my mind, they were hitting 'sustainable grand slams', and believe me, they were well-earned. These are not easy accomplishments, especially in the developing world, and the extra effort and cost, is worthy of our support. But I'll ask you this, is that where our support should go?I saw many places that earned 50-60 percent of the check marks. Not amazing, but I knew they were trying. They weren't hiding anything, they were making honest attempts, I could see it in their eyes. Their hearts were in the right place, and they had green goal posts in their future. Some were off-grid properties that had no choice but to use diesel generators. Yet they grew their own organic food, were locally owned, and were strong corporate social citizens. On the eco-continuum they were barely past the half way mark, but they were sliding in the right direction. I knew that if supported financially, that their noisy diesel generator's days would be numbered, gone forever in favor of a more renewable, and hopefully quieter alternative.Herein lies our collective dilemma.Do we, as stewards of this planet, support only the efforts of those that got there. Those hitting the 'sustainable grand slam'? Or, can we enact greater global change by supporting those that are rounding second base? In a sense, it's akin to a teacher paying extra attention to an A-level student. But what about the pupil sitting right behind that A-level student. She could be trying just as hard, and sharing of the same goals and intentions, but perhaps she's not as blessed with the same natural abilities. What about her? What happens to her?If we want true wholesale change, we must give merit to those that have earned it, but we must also support those that are trying, especially in these difficult economic times. They are what we need for the future. Collectively, you and I, are what they need right now."

It doubles your chances of having an interesting conversation and learning something new.  -- Bob Payne, editor, bobcarrieson.com; travel editor, destinationw.com• Click a pic with your phone camera of the location sign where you park your car at the airport as you depart. Lifesaver when you return! • Make copies front and back of passport and credit cards, then scan the pdf and email it to yourself and a colleague, parent, or friend before traveling overseas. • Pack two small condiment packets of Heinz yellow mustard, which, when eaten, can relieve leg cramps. (It contains turmeric acid.) • Take the shade off a lamp and use the hot bulb to lightly smooth clothes' wrinkles, if no iron is available in your hotel room. (Wrap metal end in washcloth so you don't burn your hand.) -- Lori Tucker, president, Tucker & Associates, tuckerpr.com• Consider a satin pillowcase! Not only do I use one at home, I always pack one as well. It keeps my fine hair from tangling, eliminates ""bed-head,"" and helps minimize wrinkles and morning facial creases.  -- Debbra Dunning Brouillette, travel journalist, wordjourneys.net • Slip the Sephora Instant Depuffing Eye Mask (sephora.com) under your sleep mask on flights and you'll arrive looking fresh and rested! -- Andria Mitsakos, president & CEO, AMPR, andriamitsakospr.com; founder, wanderlista.com• Remember, men do not need to pack a pain-in-the-ass spray can of shaving lotion. Think about it: What's in the hotel amenity kit that does the same thing as a shaving lotion (i.e. soften hair)? You got it: hair conditioner.  -- Ed Wetschler, Caribbean editor, recommend.com; executive editor, tripatini.com• Bring a scented mini travel candle. I am sensitive to odors and never sure what aromas might await me in a new destination. My favorite candles remind me of home, too. (Obviously, I'm very careful never to leave the candle burning when not in my hotel room!) -- Suzanne Willis, travel marketing and public relations executive• Plug in a PowerTrip portable charger with a 3-way tap to maximize hotel room and airport outlets (powerstick.com). • Use a silk shoe bag, which can double as an evening purse. • Pack flannel pajamas or a robe. I once had to escape a burning hotel in a negligee and it was super embarrassing! (Cold, too!) -- Kyle McCarthy, editor, Family Travel Forum, myfamilytravels.com • Get the Body Shop's Tea Tree Cleansing Wipes (thebodyshop-usa.com). These wipes are perfect for quick facial freshen up during your flight and upon landing. I've even used them as a hand-and-face wipe for my son when he was younger. Also, if you are like me and always carry on your luggage, then these are a no brainer; no fluids, no mess, and pack flat. -- Nina Zapala, president, Zapala PR, zapalapr.com • Wear Mountain HardWear's Nitrous Jacket, which folds into its own pocket, weighs nothing, and doubles as a pillow on a plane (mountainhardwear.com). My wilderness-loving kids and husband appreciate these jackets as well. (Patagonia makes one, too.)  • Carry a reusable water bottle. (I'm partial to aluminum ones.) At the airport, after passing through security, I fill it with water, patting myself on the back for traveling greener. Then I don't have to wait for a flight attendant to come around on the plane.  • Get quick-dry ExOfficio clothes (exofficio.com), especially helpful as lightweight adventure travel clothes. -- Eileen Ogintz, travel journalist; book author, The Kid's Guide to Washington DC, The Kid's Guide to NYC, and The Kid's Guide to Orlando; founder, takingthekids.com• Make a travel checklist. No matter how many times I had packed, I forgot something. Now I have a list. First thing on it is a thin tote bag, one that can be folded into almost nothing. -- Kay Showker, travel journalist; book author, The 100 Best Resorts in the Caribbean, The Outdoor Traveler's Guide to the Caribbean, The Unofficial Guide to Cruises, and Caribbean Ports of Call• Enjoy your good luck travel charms. I wear a little rope bracelet whenever I travel to South America. At my first travel conference in Lima, Peru, I missed a transfer and found myself across town from my destination with little prospect of getting a rush-hour taxi. Then, in the lobby of my hotel, I met an exhibitor at the same conference. Long story short, we found a shared cab to the conference, I practiced my Spanish with him, and he gave me the bracelet.  -- Brian Major, executive editor, travalliancemedia.com• Rethink your travel-size toiletries. I've cleaned out a couple small, round, lidded containers that had cosmetics samples in them and now use them to hold more than a week's worth of toothpaste and shaving cream. The huge and more cost-effective tubes won't make it through airport security and the ready-made travel-size items are more expensive, especially if you're stuck and have to buy them at the airport.  -- Clint Brownfield, travel journalist• Pack a sketchbook. It's my favorite thing. I have no artistic talent, but I love the discipline of sitting down and really looking at where I am, capturing it in a deeper way than a camera ever could. -- Pam Grout, travel journalist; book author, The 100 Best Worldwide Vacations to Enrich Your Life, The 100 Best Volunteer Vacations to Enrich Your Life, Girlfriend Getaways: You Go Girl and I'll Go, Too!, You Know You're in Kansas When..., Kansas Curiosities, Colorado Curiosities; pamgrout.com; georgeclooneyslepthere.com• Stash a supply of antibacterial wipes to sanitize armrests on an airplane. Armrests are the ""bathroom doorknob"" of the travel experience -- countless people resting their arms, books, snacks, and trash there for hours at a time. Do a quick swipe. • Wear ThermaCare heat wraps (thermacare.com). I use them to minimize hurting my back and to reduce backaches on long flights.  -- Nancy J. Friedman, president, Nancy J. Friedman Public Relations, njfpr.com• Carry a small water mist spray bottle -- to keep cool when traveling in warm climates. • Tote a Mini Febreeze (febreeze.com). I love a clean-smelling hotel room. -- Katie Riguzzi, director of public relations, Club Med, clubmed.com• Understand what's really essential. For me, it's all about relaxing and knowing that I have the skills and equipment in order to make anything right. There are only two things that I absolutely must have while traveling: my ID and a credit card. Everything else is disposable and/or replaceable. Knowing that fact removes a ton of stress from traveling and somehow makes everything flow more smoothly. If I've forgotten anything, been robbed, lost my bag, missed my flight -- they can all be remedied. -- Rob Klepper, vice president, Geiger & Associates, geigerpr.com• Bring duct tape. It comes to the rescue if a sandal strap, purse handle, or backpack breaks.  • Use a rubber doorstopper. Regardless of the hotel ranking, many hotel room doors and inner-connecting rooms do not have security locks. Play it safe and kick that doorstopper under the door.  • Cherish something sentimental. I wear or carry a piece of my mother's jewelry. When I'm frustrated, lonely, or annoyed, I touch it and think, ""How would Mother have handled this situation?"" I know in most cases she would be more patient, friendly, and humble. She'd be grateful to be on a trip, regardless of the inconveniences.  • Take great photos with a 3-in-1 Fisheye, Macro, Wide-Angle lens (olloclip.com) for your iPhone or iPod touch. It fits in your pocket. -- Marybeth Bond, travel journalist, National Geographic and CNN; book author, Gutsy Women, 50 Best Girlfriends Getaways in North America, A Woman's World, A Woman's Passion for Travel, Gutsy Mamas: Travel Tips and Wisdom for Mamas on the Road, A Mother's World: Journeys of the Heart, A Woman's Europe; gutsytraveler.com • Keep warm. I always bring my cashmere travel blanket from Restoration Hardware (restorationhardware.com). Of better quality than most blankets you find in even business or first class, I use it on the plane, which is invariably cold, and it makes me feel pampered when I'm flying economy. Since it's in an off-white color with light gray trim, it does double duty as a shawl. -- Karen Weiner Escalera, president, KWE Partners, kwegroup.com; editor, miamicurated.com • Take care of your health especially the night before a plane trip. Drink lots of water to hydrate, workout, and sleep at least 7 to 8 hours.  • During a long flight, break mid-way to stand in the aisle and stretch your Achilles tendons and calf muscles. • Do not fly hungry. Grab a banana, dried fruit, or instant oatmeal. -- Hoyt H. Harper II, senior vice president, global brand leader, Sheraton Hotels & Resorts, starwoodhotels.com/sheraton• Get a Kipling Eldorado small cross-body travel bag (kipling-usa.com). It can carry cash, passport, keys, and more. Well made, with strong zippers and lots of compartments and in great colors, it looks terrific.  -- Phyllis Stoller, founder, The Women's Travel Group, thewomenstravelgroup.com• Invest in a waterproof shell raincoat. I layer my GORE-TEX raincoat (gore-tex.com) with my EMS fleece (ems.com) when I am cold on a long bus ride or flight. It blocks the wind and blasting AC. • Facilitate sleep anytime with earplugs. I'm not an earplug snob; 80 decibel-level pharmacy ones work great.  -- Nora Walsh, founder, patchworkcompass.com• Roll a tennis ball under your feet to keep from getting stiff and sore on a flight. Sometimes I'll put it behind my back as well for a sort of massage. It's small, inexpensive, and easy to replace. -- Brian Povinelli, senior vice president, global brand leader, Westin Hotels & Resorts and Le Mérdien, starwoodhotels.com/westin • Walk! John Muir, the great naturalist and explorer once said, ""In every walk with nature, one receives far more than he seeks."" So anytime that I am away from home, I build in ample time to walk. Whether strolling beside a bucolic sheep-filled hillside in New Zealand or meandering along the River Seine in Paris, there's no better way to appreciate a locale. And if I'm on a long beach or path, pure bliss is listening to a good book on tape. In fact, I often say that as a writer, my best travel stories come to me, unfolding while I'm inhaling the scenery on two feet. In my book, My City, My New York: Famous New Yorkers Share Their Favorite Places, so many people talked about the joy of walking that I devoted an entire chapter to it. As Mayor Bloomberg told me, ""What do I love to do in New York? Walking the streets."" Walking is the ultimate way to explore. I never know what magic I will uncover.  -- Jeryl Brunner, journalist and book author, jerylbrunner.com• Try Instagram (instagram.com). It combines the fun of photography with the limit of text and is very immediate. There's no editing like the way you do with blogs or articles. It's much more off-the-cuff and uses filters that are reminiscent of the past like a Polaroid. It's a fun way to connect on social media with friends and fellow travelers -- and keeps my eyes sharp for an image that works well within the confines of the small frame.  -- Waheeda Harris, travel journalist, about.me/waheedaharris• Relax. I refuse to work on airplanes. I cherish the in-flight experience as much-needed ""me time"" -- drinking an extra glass of wine, watching silly movies, attempting to defeat Spider solitaire in my iPod. When I see hard-nosed road warriors working on their laptops six hours into a flight, I don't feel guilty; I feel pity. -- Mark Orwoll, international editor, Travel & Leisure, travelandleisure.com• Pack clothes that are wrapped in dry cleaning plastic. That way, if baggage handlers leave your luggage in the rain, no worries.  • Carry on the plane noise-cancelling headphones and nuts and raisins. Also, most important for me is the latest issue of Vanity Fair magazine. If my flight is delayed for take-off and electronics are put away, I am guaranteed a good read for two hours! • Download these two apps, which are on my iPad: FlightTrack (for gate numbers, delays, change in terminals; much faster and more accurate than anything posted at the airport) and The Weather Channel (for an up-to-date destination forecast). • Bring an extra box of cough drops. When someone near me on the plane is hacking away, I give him or her the whole box -- seriously! -- Laura Davidson, president, Laura Davidson Public Relations, ldpr.com• Tuck into your carry-on bag something sentimental. Ten years ago, my sweet son gave me a wooden Christmas ornament that depicts San Cristobal, the patron saint of travelers. It has been in my camera bag ever since as I have traveled through more than 40 countries. It always brings a smile to my face and a sense of peace when I see it or run my hand across it.  • Maximize your camera's use. I can barely read my own handwriting, particularly when I scribble in a hurry, so I use my camera to ""take notes."" I snap a photo of my guestroom door, because few hotels put numbers on keys anymore. I also document restaurant names, menus, nametags, business cards, street and destination signs. -- Lynn O'Rourke Hayes, travel journalist, familytravel.com• Keep a packing list on your smart-phone. For different destinations, my iPhone Note page gets tweaked. Recently, I forgot to bring my sunglasses, which now have been added to that list. • Ask the hotel staff for destination recommendations. At our Jamaican hotels, many of the staff will go out in the evenings. If you're a bit timid about going out on your own in a foreign shore, the people who work in hotels know all the fun things to do. At GoldenEye, many of our team love bringing guests out for a night on the town and showing them how great the island is. All you need to do is ask. -- Rachel Harrison, chief marketing officer, Island Outpost, islandoutpost.com• Bring a bulldog clip for those hotel rooms where the drapes don't quite close and the light floods in. It is invaluable! -- Geoffrey Weill, president, Geoffrey Weill Public Relations and Marketing, geoffreyweill.com• Keep a journal. I will not leave home without a small moleskin notebook and a pen I love. While I often take notes for professional reasons, I have one notebook that is used exclusively for personal thoughts and observations. Each morning on the road, I start the day by writing. It can be on any topic -- about the place I am, about missing home, any random feelings. It really centers me and gives me something to refer back to once home again. -- Susan Farewell, travel journalist; founder, travel concierge firm -- Farewell Travels LLC, farewelltravels.com• Tuck in a roll of Scotch tape. It comes in handy to close the lids of messy products like shampoo, creams, and perfume before popping them into my suitcase. Can also use tape to jury-rig all kinds of stuff on the road, from torn documents to dangling hems.  -- Heidi Sarna, travel journalist, heidisarna.com • Stay safe at your destination by thinking outside the box, especially when traveling solo! When other travelers ask you what you do for a living and you're not sure if they can be trusted, tell them you're a policewoman on holiday. I do it all the time just to be on the safe side. -- Evelyn Hannon, editor, journeywoman.com• Be comfortable. I travel with my own down pillow. No matter how luxurious a hotel, I don't like to rest my head on an unknown pillow. This is a bit of an annoying habit, but one that gives me comfort and I simply can't kick. I don't even take the pillow on the plane; it's in my checked luggage.  -- Andrea Schnoor, president, Andrea Schnoor Communications, andreaschnoor.com • Stash a roll-up backpack. Invariably, in my travels, I will need to carry something around or buy an item. A foldable pack is easy, safe, and convenient. It also offers a great carry-on option for souvenirs. • Invest in a voltage converter, if you travel internationally. Choose a universal converter that has different prongs for anywhere in the world. • Buy travel insurance. I value its security. You never know whether your trip will need to be canceled, your luggage will get lost, or you will get sick. -- Jason Hedrick, American Express travel insider; general manager, Azumano Travel, azumano.com  • Exercise your way out of jet lag. My secret for overcoming jet lag and sleepless travel is forcing myself to do an afternoon or evening cardio workout (preferably ellipticals), which, after the first ten minutes, almost always makes me feel renewed.  -- Peter Knego, cruise journalist, maritimematters.com/category/ship-blogs• Pack your curiosity! It's a quality that often eludes me in my day-to-day life where I walk around with a see no evil/hear no evil/speak no evil attitude. But when I'm on the road, I am open and eager for new experiences. -- Sherry Amantenstein, travel journalist• Take a little travel clock that shows multiple time zones at once. I set mine for where I am at the moment and the time at home. That stops me from arriving bleary-eyed from wherever and calling my family at some weird hour. My clock also comes with a little flashlight and an alarm. • Consider a small digital picture frame loaded with favorite family photos. Setting it up in my hotel room makes me feel more connected while traveling. • Tuck a small lavender sachet into your luggage. It makes my clothes smell good and keeps odors in dirty-clothes away. I have two daughters and they have their favorite sachet travel scents, too. -- Nancy Schretter, managing editor, Family Travel Network, familytravelnetwork.com• Evaluate your sporting equipment before traveling. Almost all equipment is more expensive to buy outside the U.S. If you're going to Britain, the Caribbean, or even Hawaii to play golf, for instance, note that golf balls are much more expensive away from the Continental U.S., so bring enough with you. Same with most other sports, and that goes for game-appropriate clothing, as well. • Traveling to play golf? (I'll bet this tip applies to skiing, too.) If you will only be playing a round or two (so only skiing one day), consider leaving your clubs/skis at home and renting. Lugging equipment through airports and hotels, as well as dealing with airlines, can be easily avoided. Just figure out for yourself the threshold -- two or more rounds? more than a day of skiing? -- that makes sense to you for bringing your own gear. -- James Frank, contributing editor, LINKS magazine, linksmagazine.com• Never leave home without a good read. As travel is always unpredictable, I bring my iPad, a few magazines, and the New York Times Book Review section. This helps make time stuck on planes or at airports positive and pleasurable. • Use the GateGuru app. It helps me track and organize my travels and sync with Tripit.com and Kayak.com. -- Cheryl Andrews, president, Cheryl Andrews Marketing Communications, cam-pr.com• Slip a small flashlight in your carry-on bag. It comes in handy checking nooks and crannies for dropped pens and whatnot. -- Steve Larese, travel journalist, stevelarese.com • Appreciate travel traditions. It never fails. Every time I start packing my brown Tumi duffel, my Havanese, named ""Mojito,"" goes into doggie funk. He sulks out of the bedroom, lies down with his fuzzy head between his front paws, sad eyes cast upward revealing the pathetically adorable white rim of his little eyeballs. He knows the drill too well: Another trip for me. Fast-forward to my return and it's a euphoric ritual. I drag my bag through the door, and Mojito practically goes into convulsions. After frenzied thigh-high jumps on my leg, I whisk this squiggling 17-pound blur into my arms and exchange kisses and licks. When I put him down he pounces on my bag and furiously scratches at the zipper demanding my help, so he can bury his nose sniffing through the deliciously stale smells of a week's worth of laundry. Then he locates his prey: a new squeaky toy from a strange land that he can happily destroy. Mamma's home! -- Valarie D'Elia, travel journalist, TV host/correspondent, NY1 News, travelwithval.com• Carry Clif bars (clifbar.com), since there is a good chance of missing a meal. • Load your iPod with podcasts, since there is a good chance of getting delayed. • Bring a real book, not battery dependent, since finding a power outlet is luck, not a given, in most airports. -- Everett Potter, editor-in-chief, Everett Potter's Travel Report, everettpotter.com• Share daily experiences with a faraway loved one. My travel ritual that truly helps me enjoy each place I go even more? Everyday, I email what I've discovered and experienced, along with photographs, to my 97-year-old grandmother, who instilled in me my love of travel. She likes to hear about my adventures and always emails me back smart questions. It is a way to share the beauty of what I'm seeing with someone else when I so often travel alone for my work. -- Karen Schaler, travel journalist, TV host/correspondent, Travel Therapy® TV and online video series; book author, Travel Therapy: Where Do You Need to Go?; traveltherapytrips.com; pix11.com/travel-therapy• Carry on your luggage. How does a lady do it? Easy: I pick one color -- black, brown, blue -- then build the suitcase contents to match. Scarves, jewelry, shawls, sweaters add color. Every jacket has both a skirt and pants that compliment. Twin sweater sets mix and match. Keep shoes to a minimum, one low and one high heel should do it. Finally, a little hand wash detergent saves the day.  -- Lou Hammond, president, Lou Hammond & Associates Public Relations, louhammond.com • Check your luggage. While you hear most frequent travelers talk about how they can squeeze everything for a week into a carry-on bag, I am the opposite. I spend half my life traveling and wouldn't enjoy it without my favorite things. My cosmetics bag has small-size versions of all the many products I use at home so I don't feel like I'm always in a strange place. It's worth it to me to check my luggage and make my travel life more comfortable. • Select lightweight fabrics, so you can layer your clothes. They don't take up a lot of room in luggage. Also, I never feel like I'm wearing the same thing over and over.  -- Marcia Frost, travel journalist and content editor, cocktailsandjoints.com; wineandspiritstravel.com; marciafrost.com• Have to check a bag? If traveling with a companion, swap a day's worth of clothing into each other's luggage. My husband and I do this. That way if one of our bags goes AWOL, neither of us has to run to the gift shop for an emergency T-shirt.  -- Sally Kilbridge, editor-in-chief, destinationw.comFinally, I leave you with my tried-and-true trip game-changers.  • Bring a lightweight electrical extension cord. I like to sleep with my iPhone on my nightstand (late-night emails, texts, twitter, music, photos, facebook, Huff Post news, and morning alarm), but hotels often don't have an available outlet near the bed. Plug in that twelve-feet-of-energy across the room and -- voilà! -- the world is near my pillow. Traveling as much as I do away from family and friends, this connectedness is much appreciated. • Stash extra Zip-lock plastic bags in quart and gallon sizes. Perfect for carrying a delicious pain au chocolat and croissant that I didn't finish at breakfast, double-wrapping potential leaky toiletries, collecting colorful autumn leaves or beach seashells, and more. • Snap a photo of your luggage (with your phone camera) when you have to check it. That way, if the bag gets lost, you'll have a timely pic to show the airline rep instead of trying to describe it. • Carry your business cards everywhere. Never know who you're going to meet. It's then easy to have your contact info at the ready. Some of my cherished relationships started in unlikely far-flung places and were jumpstarted by my handing peeps my card. • Smile. Yep, it sounds corny, but I see too many people wearing frowns. A smile is good for you, especially when traveling away from home. It's good for strangers who see you. It changes attitudes, turns a tricky situation around, and adds grace to the day. It opens hearts and doors. It doesn't cost anything and yet is priceless. It's the first thing I pack."

7,PARENTING,My 13-Year-Old and I Are Both in Hormone Hell!,"Susan Stiffelman, Contributor
Author of Parenting With Presence (and Eckhart Tolle edition) ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hormone-hell_us_5b9d1c89e4b03a1dcc848edd,"Your daughter's moods will even out, your hormones will stabilize and you will get through this rough patch.",2013-04-30,Mother and teenage daughter laughing in front of open balcony.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1c892200003000d97f47.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As an older parent via adoption, I am desperate for suggestions that will help me stop butting heads with my 13-year-old. She just had her first period ten days ago. I haven't had a period for about four months. We are both quite hormonal and both strong-willed. Even asking her to flush the toilet creates drama. We also have a 10-year-old who is getting lost in all this, as she's quite passive and avoids any and all conflict. My husband has said (probably only half-jokingly) that he'd like to move to the garage for the next six years or so. Help!Forgive me for smiling just a little as I read your email. Sometimes, I find the timing of life events -- like the hormone roller coaster you and your daughter are on at the same time -- to be so impossible that all I can do is just shake my head. You poor woman! I can hardly imagine how you -- and your daughter -- are dealing, and commend you for keeping a sense of humor about the challenges you're facing.Here's my advice:• First and foremost, let your motto be ""This, too, shall pass."" Your daughter's moods will even out, your hormones will stabilize and you will get through this rough patch. Make ""This, too, shall pass"" your mantra. Text it to yourself throughout the day. Post it on a sticky note on your bathroom mirror. Talk with parents who have lived to tell the tale about this difficult phase. Our parenting difficulties become intolerable when we imagine they will go on forever. This, too, shall pass. • Don't take things personally. While you may be doing things that needlessly push your daughter's buttons, avoid the trap of taking your daughter's behavior personally. A friend told me that when he was chatting with his now 25-year-old daughter about how she was when she was 14, she confessed, ""Dad, even if you were being nice and helping me fold my laundry, I felt like I wanted to lash out at you! It wasn't about you. I just felt angry and awful all the time, and you were a safe dumping ground for my crazy emotions."" Your daughter has a developmental imperative to push against you as she individuates. It's not personal.• Come alongside, rather than at. Imagine your daughter is walking around with an enormous button attached to her back that activates anger and defiance. At this stage -- both because she is dealing with life as a middle schooler and is flooded with hormones -- it will take very little to upset her. Try to avoid telling her what she should do. Be brief. Don't come across as desperate or needy. ""It'd be great if you'd flush the toilet, honey,"" is far better than, ""How many times do I have to tell you to flush the toilet after you use it? It's gross when I come in there to see what you've left. Can't you just remember to flush?""• Strengthen connection. Believe it or not, your daughter needs you desperately. She is on a wild ride, and probably feels very uncomfortable in her own skin. The more she feels she can lean on you without being judged or scolded, the better she'll be able to relax. Look for things she enjoys that the two of you can do together. Bake, paint, hike or bike. Closeness will reduce some of the friction between you.• Modify your expectations. I am not a fan of using war terminology when speaking about parenting (""Pick your battles!""), but I do think you would be well-served to let go of enforcing certain things on principle. If she doesn't flush the toilet, mention that you wish she would, but don't make it a power struggle. She may be itching for a fight. The less needy you are, the more empowered you will come across. I sometimes invite parents I work with to keep in mind these words: Amused and Indifferent. In other words, don't attach great meaning to every interaction. Expect her to be edgy and you'll be less disappointed if she is.Trust me when I say that you will get through this. But in the meantime, make sure you have plenty of positive human contact with those whose presence is uplifting and supportive. You need and deserve it!Do you have a question for the Parent Coach?

Okay is relative term, but the world won't end because you didn't finish a project on time and the best thing that you can do as soon as you finish reading this is manage your HALT (hungry, angry, lonely, tired). So, finish this blog post, make sure you have lunch, take a walk to calm down, text someone you love and get home early enough to go to bed at a reasonable hour. No matter whether you are an intern or a CEO, all of us have moments where we feel overwhelmed at work. Whether we blame it on our cultural obsession with being ""connected"" or our collective inability to unplug, when we feel overwhelmed it can be paralyzing. The trick is to know what to do when you feel this way so that you can make smart decisions that are intentional and not based merely on alleviating your discomfort. Have you ever found yourself sitting at your desk and it's 3 p.m. and you haven't had lunch yet and there are 68 emails that all claim to be urgent and your supervisor has a question that you need to answer and you find your breath getting shallow and your chest getting tight as you think about the projects due at the end of the week and all the exciting ideas you had are now just toxic thought clouds that you can't wait to get away from. Don't panic.In this moment of dread, the answer isn't quit your job or throw your computer out the window. You aren't failing; you have simply reached a decision point, or more specifically a prioritization moment. Before doing anything else, you need to step away from your desk and grab a quick bite and a short walk. When you return, try the three steps below to ground yourself and get practical. Step #1: Make the Invisible, VisibleSometimes when we feel overwhelmed, taking the time to write down the tasks in front of us allows our minds to slow down. Writing down the projects that you need to complete takes your stress that exists in some amorphous shape in your mind and translates it into something that is literally visible. When things are tangible they are much easier to organize. Step #2: Pile ItI'm an advocate what I call the ""Post-It method."" Write your projects down as single items on individual Post-Its. Once you have your stack of Post-Its create three distinct piles (""Today""/""This Week""/""The Future""). By creating time boundaries based on ""must do"" rather than ""should do,"" you are one step closer to getting back in control. Step #3: The Sun Will Come Out TomorrowWhen you feel overwhelmed, it's because your mind is fatigued, and when you're fatigued, the answer is always rest. Your mind is attempting to manage a lot of information and having taken a moment to organize and prioritize, don't re-escalate your panic by plunging back into to work. Clean up your desk, set everything up for a successful tomorrow and log out of Outlook. And remember, every project starts one step at a time.For more by Simone N.

10,WEDDINGS,DIY'ing Your Wedding? 3 Questions That'll Make You Question that Decision,"Kellee Khalil, Contributor
Founder and CEO, Lover.ly",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diy-wedding_us_5b9d0b87e4b03a1dcc84020c,"It seems like DIY weddings are everywhere these days, and while we love looking at them...we're not sure we'd actually like to plan one ourselves.",2013-04-29,2016-04-13-1460565235-1204955-couple_colorful_wedding.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-13-1460565235-1204955-couple_colorful_wedding-thumb.jpg,"It seems like DIY weddings are everywhere these days, and while we love looking at them...we're not sure we'd actually like to plan one ourselves. While doing your wedding decor yourself is the right move for a lot of brides (it can satisfy a creative need), it's definitely not for everyone. So if you're feeling pressure to DIY every wedding detail and the idea of it makes you a little queasy, here are three questions to ask yourself before you decide to do it yourself. 1. Could my craft skills put Martha Stewart's to shame? While some brides definitely unleash their inner artist while planning their weddings, some of us get results that look more like a fourth-grade art project (complete with dried macaroni and too much glue). While the DIY project you see on a blog might look perfect, yours might look a bit too homemade. If you aren't sure about your craft skills, try a few non-wedding-related craft projects before you plan to DIY anything. (Think creating table decor for a friend's wedding shower or designing your own holiday cards.) If you find you're pretty good at these projects (and actually enjoy them), DIY might be a good choice. But if the finished project falls flat, don't beat yourself up...start hunting for a pro who can get the job done. Photo by Adrienne Gunde on Wedding Chicks via Loverly.2. How much is my time worth? How much do you get paid an hour? How much do you make for odd jobs like baby-sitting, or for working overtime? Figure out your hourly rate and take that into consideration as you tell yourself that a DIY project is going to be the cheaper option. Because even though it can be less expensive to do things yourself, sometimes it's hard to know all the reasons the pros cost so much. Once you account for the materials and time (time spent researching, practicing, picking up supplies, returning to the store when you realize you forgot something -- which almost always happens), you may realize you'd be better off paying a professional (especially if your project turns out badly and you end up hiring someone anyway). Our advice: find vendors you really connect with and support their small businesses by paying them to do their best work for you. Photo by Tanja Lippert on Southern Weddings via Loverly. 3. Is anyone going to help me with this? Before you decide to do your own wedding decor, talk to your fiance/e, family, and friends to find out if anyone is willing to help you. Signing everyone around you up for a bunch of DIY projects before having a conversation about your expectations is a recipe for disaster.

11,WEDDINGS,DIY'ing Your Wedding? 3 Questions That'll Make You Question that Decision,"Kellee Khalil, Contributor

While doing your wedding decor yourself is the right move for a lot of brides (it can satisfy a creative need), it's definitely not for everyone. So if you're feeling pressure to DIY every wedding detail and the idea of it makes you a little queasy, here are three questions to ask yourself before you decide to do it yourself. 1. Could my craft skills put Martha Stewart's to shame? While some brides definitely unleash their inner artist while planning their weddings, some of us get results that look more like a fourth-grade art project (complete with dried macaroni and too much glue). While the DIY project you see on a blog might look perfect, yours might look a bit too homemade. If you aren't sure about your craft skills, try a few non-wedding-related craft projects before you plan to DIY anything. (Think creating table decor for a friend's wedding shower or designing your own holiday cards.) If you find you're pretty good at these projects (and actually enjoy them), DIY might be a good choice. But if the finished project falls flat, don't beat yourself up...start hunting for a pro who can get the job done. Photo by Adrienne Gunde on Wedding Chicks via Loverly.2. How much is my time worth? How much do you get paid an hour? How much do you make for odd jobs like baby-sitting, or for working overtime? Figure out your hourly rate and take that into consideration as you tell yourself that a DIY project is going to be the cheaper option. Because even though it can be less expensive to do things yourself, sometimes it's hard to know all the reasons the pros cost so much. Once you account for the materials and time (time spent researching, practicing, picking up supplies, returning to the store when you realize you forgot something -- which almost always happens), you may realize you'd be better off paying a professional (especially if your project turns out badly and you end up hiring someone anyway). Our advice: find vendors you really connect with and support their small businesses by paying them to do their best work for you. Photo by Tanja Lippert on Southern Weddings via Loverly. 3. Is anyone going to help me with this? Before you decide to do your own wedding decor, talk to your fiance/e, family, and friends to find out if anyone is willing to help you. Signing everyone around you up for a bunch of DIY projects before having a conversation about your expectations is a recipe for disaster. Start by having a conversation with your fiance/e about how much time you're each willing to devote to wedding planning each week and discuss how each of you thinks that time would be best spent; then check with your friends and family to see what their schedules and priorities are. Once you have feedback from everyone, be honest about how much time you're going to have to put in alone, and consider whether that's going to be fun for you...or a huge source of stress.

13,HOME & LIVING,How Decorating With Books Personalizes A Home,"Elaine Steiner, Contributor
Design blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/decorating-with-books_us_5b9d12c0e4b03a1dcc8449cd,Who would have guessed that reading materials warms up a room.,2013-04-29,Luxury and classic style living room with bookshelf,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d12c01f00005000217827.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's an unwritten rule of interior design to introduce books into a room as a way to personalize or warm up a space. People who had the means used to devote entire rooms to housing their books. Take the Morgan Library, for example, with its collection of exquisitely bound volumes lining the walls. Or visit the Frick. Both were private homes before they became the museums they are today. One of the most beautiful rooms in New York City, The Lotos Club's library, is the oldest private literary club in the city which was originally home to a Vanderbilt.Artists used to illustrate books, which is reason enough to make older editions instant collectibles. Printers created type faces in various styles and designers challenged themselves to create eye-catching dust covers that conveyed the subject of the novel or the importance of the book's topic.Books were always available in the homes I grew up in. As a child, they were a frequent birthday gift. I would happily read A.A. Milne and memorize his poems when I was very young: ""Halfway up the stairs is a stair where I sit, There isn't any other stair quite like it."" Growing up, I read Alice in Wonderland, series like the Bobbsey Twins and Nancy Drew, adventure tales by Robert Louis Stevenson and novels by Louisa May Alcott. I savored and saved these volumes for my own children to read. And they did, along with Dr. Seuss and their own current favorites. Bookcases were a decorating staple in children's rooms -- not merely a repository for their school texts.Architects incorporated bookshelves into living room walls adjacent to fireplaces. Clients who didn't have a significant collection to display were asked by designers to peruse the selections at thrift shops to populate their shelves.Books are social. They invite company. Imagine the arrangement of a small grouping of volumes held upright between a pair of Baccarat bookends -- a smart accessory that creates a tableau equal to a free-standing piece of sculpture. They ""make a statement.""Books are sexy. It's a rare book that stays closed for long on a tabletop or isn't pulled from a shelf. Someone will pick it up, thumb through and spend a few minutes looking it over. They may even ask to borrow it.In a way, the innovative twenty-first century offers a challenge to bibliophiles. A quick search on Google is the only resource we need when looking for information. (As a result, I had difficulty finding a recipient for my cherished Encyclopedia Brittanica when I moved to a smaller apartment.) In an instant, we can call up the latest best-sellers and classics. Of course, back-lighted Kindles and Nooks are convenient for travel or reading in bed and on the beach. But, you can't make notes in the margins when you are delighted by a particularly felicitous phrase -- or for that matter disagree with the author's ""take"" on a character's reaction. And despite the wide variety of colorful protective covers available for these remarkable devices, you only need one -- and your e-reader alone doesn't fill a shelf accustomed to displaying well-bound or well-designed dust covers that reveal the subjects and writers that interest you.Which raises another issue: In this fast-paced, instant-information era, how much do we really know about one another? We e-mail and tweet only what we choose to reveal, and the latter restricts our communication to a prescribed number of strokes.  There is something about reaching for a book that opens new vistas for each of us. We can travel the world. We can re-visit places we have known and recall our adventures there. And though it's true that we can (and probably will) read on screen, it's the work itself that counts. But, if you instead choose a novel which you have read and re-read at various periods throughout your lifetime, the experience is one of easy familiarity akin to spending a few hours with a dear friend.And if you are about to make the acquaintance of a writer who is new to you, there's a thrill of anticipation. Who is this person? Will we get along? Will I laugh when the author laughs and cry when she cries? Am I about to be frightened? Enlightened? What will I learn? Does she express herself clearly, poetically or memorably? Am I eager to read his/her next book? So if you're like me, who reads a newly published book borrowed from the library, you'll probably go to your computer and order a hard copy to place in your own library. It's great to be in the company of good friends.Have something to say? Check out HuffPost Home on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram.**Do you have a home story idea or tip?
