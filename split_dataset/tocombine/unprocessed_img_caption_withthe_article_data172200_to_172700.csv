0,PARENTING,Growing a Generation Who Doesn't know How to Fail,"Andrew Braner, Contributor
CEO/President KIVU Gap Year",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/failure_us_5b9c80c4e4b03a1dcc7f3e09,Parents: We are not there to make life easy on our kids. It's our job to help them grow up with the skills to become successful adults.,2012-11-12,"File photo dated 17/08/11 of a woman looking into the window of a job centre as a third of unemployed young people have not received any responses to job applications in the past year, new research has shown.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c80c42100003100c52674.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" - Winston ChurchillI spend a lot of time coaching and mentoring teenagers and university students. Ten years ago, they thought me ""cool"" enough to invite to hangout, but my role is quickly transitioning. With more grey hair appearing and the number of birthdays only increasing, I've quickly become the person to play the""cool uncle"" role in many student's lives. Today, my role is to bridge language and culture between students and parents, actually translating what's going on in the pop-teen culture to help parents and youth mentors better understand 13-25 year olds. I take this job very seriously, and think to help even ONE family bridge the gap between a student who lives in anger and frustration and one who can understand the world around them is a huge feat. I feel lucky to be a help and incredibly humbled when it works out.The other day, I was visiting a local high school lunchroom at the invitation of the local administration. I find working in the cafeteria is much like being an undercover agent searching for clues; I learn quickly how to translate teenage language, hear the latest trends in the youth world and better understand how to help parents understand youth culture. This particular lunchroom was filled with healthy Whole Foods-type meals, and when I stood in line to get my food, I noticed several mothers standing outside with hot fast food lunches for their kids. I asked one of the students I was standing in line with, ""What's up with that?"" ""Oh, those moms bring their kids lunches to school everyday. I guess they just keep forgetting to send them with money."" He said.Forget sending them with money?I remember growing up, going to school and walking to the lunchroom. If I didn't pack my own lunch or remember my lunch money, I went hungry for the day. I didn't die of starvation. I didn't fail my tests due to poor nutrition. I actually learned if I don't bring my lunch, I go hungry. (Today, I rarely forget to think about where I'm going to be when I need to eat.) My failure actually turned into a lesson of survival. As I reflect on the implications of this army of mothers coming to serve their kids in the local cafeteria, I'm convinced there is a greater issue at hand than simply helping kids have a lunch. We're watching a generation grow up who doesn't know how to fail. I've heard of moms who bring homework to school when students forget.I've heard of dads actually doing the work.I've interviewed university students who have set phone calls every morning from parents who wake them up to go to class so they don't sleep late.I've watched parents work with employers to make sure their kids get a good job.I've personally been in meetings where parents try to convince teachers their kid needs a better grade in a particular class. Parents: We are not there to make life easy on our kids. It's our job to help them grow up with the skills to become successful adults. And you and I both know life is filled with failure. The Result: The newest trend I see in university graduates is extended adolescence. With the economy still struggling to come back, over half of new university graduates are unemployed. They don't know how to get a job because they were never trained. Many opted out of job training for classes to boost grade point averages. They don't know how to get a place to live, because they've always been given options. Many students just won't accept living in a low-rent area if they were brought up with their own room in a suburban neighborhood that took their parents a lifetime to save for. They don't know how to manage money because they've always had a parent working hard to provide for them. So, what do these new graduates do? They move back in with their parents until they ""save enough money"" to move out and get their own place. All the while they're playing X-Box LIVE in the basement waiting for the perfect career opportunity to fall in their lap. Of course, I'm stereotyping a large chunk of the Millennial Generation, but parents, please read this carefully: IT'S OK FOR YOUR KID TO FAIL.All of the important life lessons I've learned have come because of a failure. When I was in college, the questions I missed on the test where the ones I remember the most, not the successes. If we don't let our kids feel failure at home, then they'll find failure somewhere in life, and it will be more painful the longer they wait. None of us want to see our kids fail, go hungry or suffer. But often, the way we allow our kids to experience failure shapes their character development. They become the people they want to be, rather than coasting through life on the life preserver called Mom and Dad. I'm not advocating we just send them to the big bad world alone, but helping our kids understand life lessons is part of the job."

""We're accustomed to the TSA at airports when we travel,"" she says. ""But now it seems they are ubiquitous. I understand that the presidential candidates need security, but wasn't the TSA originally formed for airport security?""Well, that was the idea. But a look at TSA's mission statement, which isn't limited to air travel, means the agency could try to ""protect"" you anytime you set foot outside your home. When Verbeeck's friend was selected for a special screening, and agents started wanding him, she began snapping photos.""An agent walked up to me waving his arm at me and told me, 'No picture-taking allowed!,'"" she remembers.She complied -- but sent me the images.The TSA has repeatedly insisted that passengers are allowed to take photos at a checkpoint, as long as it doesn't interfere with the screening. Perhaps the agent patting down her friend didn't get that memo.But so what? I mean, stories about the TSA's disregard for the law and its problematic mission creep are hardly new. The agency wants the money for 37 new teams of VIPR screeners like the ones who screened Verbeek and her family, at a cost to taxpayers of $100 million a year. (VIPR stands for Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response team, one of the most unfortunate acronyms ever used by the federal government.)That's not where the story ends, though.""As Romney was speaking about the effects and efforts of Hurricane Sandy, a man in the crowd suddenly pulled out a handmade fabric banner that read 'End Climate Silence' and yelled out to Romney that 'climate change caused Sandy,'"" she recalls. ""The heckler was escorted out and he continued to yell on his way out the door.""""I guess the TSA did not notice his sign,"" she adds.The conspiracy theorists among us might connect a few dots here. I'll do the heavy lifting for you. Have a look at the Democratic and Republican platforms and pay attention to the campaign rhetoric and you'll see that only one party -- the Republicans -- presented any kind of threat to the agency's status quo. Romney's party had adopted a platform that included TSA reform, and it supported privatizing large parts of the agency.But the TSA doesn't want to be reformed. Last week, it ratified a union contract, which many observers believed would never happen. As an institution, it wants to expand, not be reined in and privatized.(Disclosure: I didn't vote for either of the major candidates, for what it's worth.)What would you do if you were assigned to screen supporters of a party that you knew presented a threat to your job security? If you answered: harass them, fail to properly screen them and indirectly allow the candidate to be heckled, then congratulations -- here's your tin foil hat and your very own copy of ""The X-Files: The Complete Collector's Edition.""Did the TSA cost the Republicans the presidency? In such a close presidential election, anything could have swayed the electorate. But I think it's safe to say the agency didn't exactly help.More to the point, the TSA doesn't belong at political rallies. Anyone familiar with the history of totalitarianism in the 20th century understands the danger of having an amorphous, paramilitary security organization with an open-ended mission.The next time you catch a uniformed agent outside a terminal, take a picture and send it to me with a short explanation of the circumstances. I'll publish it. If enough Americans see this nonsense, maybe it will end.Then again, maybe not."
2,PARENTING,A Staten Island Mom's Reflection on Sandy,"Dawn Papandrea, Contributor

You won't get it unless you hear the frequent sound of military choppers in the air and have to explain to your frightened kids why your neighborhood looks like a war zone.",2012-11-12,"Lisa Kravchenko, of Staten Island, stands amongst flood debris in her princess Halloween costume, Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2012, in the Staten Island borough of New York. Sandy, the storm that made landfall Monday, caused multiple fatalities, halted mass transit and cut power to more than 6 million homes and businesses. (AP Photo/ John Minchillo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c81eb2000004e00fd98f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Seventeen days ago, I was your typical working mom, juggling my job, my freelance work, kids' activities and countless household responsibilities. I hated doing laundry, giving my kids a bath was a chore I dreaded (and tried to pass off to my husband as often as possible) and the morning rush to get the boys off to school was the most stressful part of my day. In the post-Sandy world on Staten Island, I'm thankful for my working washing machine, and I welcome the extra loads from family who lost their basement appliances or still have no power from the storm. I'm grateful for the warm water that splashes onto the bathroom floor when my boys decide to get into a bath time splash fight. I don't even mind getting up extra early to get the kids to school on time (well, at least my third grader whose school has power) because of all of the drivers waiting in gas lines tying up traffic. I no longer mind these things because for a very brief period of time, these luxuries were taken away from me. And believe me -- I consider myself beyond fortunate, and have a tremendous amount of ""survivor guilt."" Because within walking distance from my home, so many friends, relatives, coworkers and classmates of my children are still waking up to a cold, dark reality, realizing that Superstorm Sandy wasn't just a nightmare or bad movie on the Sci-Fi channel. Sandy devastated all Staten Islanders in varying degrees, whether we lost our electricity, our basements, our cars or our entire homes. But as a mom, my heart hurts everyday for those who lost everything that truly matters. When I hug my boys at night, I wonder if my arms would have been strong enough to hold onto them if a raging tidal wave tried to tear us apart and take them away from me. One Staten Island mother found out the dreadful answer to that question, and my heart aches for her.It took me five days to cry after Sandy; I guess I was sort of shell-shocked. And when I tell you what set me off, you'll probably think it's odd. I finally ventured out to the local supermarket, dodging downed trees and power lines for some essentials (everything in our refrigerator was spoiled by then), and I saw the massive line of people waiting just to get into the laundromat. It was their faces that got me -- the faces on those weary women, sad, exhausted and almost lifeless as they stood out in the freezing cold with garbage bags full of soiled clothing. Seeing them humanized this tragedy for me in a way that Facebook photos could not, and I realized it had only just begun.I cried again when I received a message from my son's school on day six that power was restored; the principal said she'd work with families who lost uniforms, school supplies and backpacks. Until that moment, I hadn't really thought about the kids in my son's class who might live in Zone A (the evacuation area that was hardest hit), and imagined the turmoil those poor families must be going through. Soon after, I learned that 19 families in my parish alone lost their homes -- their entire homes, gone in a flash.The devastation you see on TV is shockingly close to my mostly unscathed home. But if you're not from here (or Breezy Point, or the Rockaways, or Coney Island, or the Jersey Shore) you probably don't fully understand. I cried for the lives lost and changed forever by Katrina, but I never really understood until now. You can't fathom what destruction is until you see familiar faces amid debris, faces you know from the supermarket, karate class, church or the playground. You won't get it unless you hear the frequent sound of military choppers in the air and have to explain to your frightened kids why your neighborhood looks like a war zone. You haven't smelled devastation until you've breathed in the combination of sewage and bleach when you bring hot coffee to loved ones sticking it out in the still-powerless Zone A. My boys have learned a lot, too, beyond just what it feels like to go a few days without an Internet connection or Super Mario Wii. My 8-year-old asked me if it was selfish of him to be upset that he missed Halloween. I told him that he had every right to feel cheated because Sandy was not fair to us, but to be sadder for the people who no longer had a place to live. I couldn't bear to tell him to be sad for the children who lost their moms, dads or grandparents. Or for the two little boys, not so different from him and his brother, who were swept away. After he returned to school and heard unfiltered stories about others whose lives were lost or changed forever, he realized how lucky we were, and he prays every night. My 3-year-old, who's not a big fan of the dark or disrupted routines to begin with, had a rough week, too, and still hasn't been able to return to his school. In fact, his teacher -- a mom of three herself -- is among those who are now displaced. Thank God for Sesame Street for giving me an age-appropriate explanation I can share with him.It's nearly two weeks later (although it feels like an eternity) and here's what makes me cry now: The devastation that began with surging flood waters has turned into a calm and steady stream of good will, donations and neighbors helping neighbors. Volunteer clean up crews are out in full force, ready for their next assignment with shovels in hand. Party centers, catering halls and bowling alleys have been transformed into donation centers. My nieces and nephews organized a ""bucket brigade,"" collecting and packaging cleanup supplies to bring to the neighborhoods in need of them. Out-of-state friends are sending care packages and taking up collections. I've turned my blog and Facebook page into a tool to match volunteers with those in need and publicize relief and recovery efforts. Everyone I know is doing his or her part, and it's truly overwhelming, in a wonderful way!I've realized that my boys have been given a great gift just a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving -- the opportunity to witness the triumph of the human spirit and the power of compassion. Still, I catch myself selfishly mourning the loss of places that were dear to me (just like my son did when I told him trick-or-treating would have to wait until next year). We won't be enjoying our family walks on the South Beach boardwalk anytime soon, or playing in the sea turtle sprinklers at Midland Beach next summer. My girlfriends and I have to find a new restaurant for our girls' nights since our favorite one is now in pieces amid the Great Kills Marina. And never again will my family hear about an impending storm without feeling anxiety or fear. As I watch my community begin its healing process, though, I have tremendous faith and a whole lot of pride for the resilience of my family and my fellow Staten Islanders. I may have grown up across the Verrazano in Brooklyn, but this is my home now, and I'm so glad that my boys will spend their childhood years in this very special place. Staten Island is where my heart now resides."

Get ready for some SHOWTIME!,2012-11-11,"LOS ANGELES, CA - OCTOBER 21: Dwight Howard #12 (L) and Kobe Bryant #24 of the Los Angeles Lakers talks as they warm up to play the Sacramento Kings at Staples Center on October 21, 2012 in Los Angeles, California.

The Lakers have been the epitome of a stable franchise known for their deliberate and astute decision making. Newly acquired point guard Steve Nash, expected to make a major impact, has been injured for most of the games and is not expected back. New center, Dwight Howard is recovering from back surgery and is only able to perform at roughly 70 percent of his normal capacity.The staff has installed a new ""Princeton offense"" which the players are still in the process of adjusting too. With all of these challenges, fans had been warned from the beginning that it would take some time to gel. The team lost all eight of their preseason games -- but appeared to use them as a chance to view different combinations of players rather than focusing on victory. It lost four of the first five games, but the NBA season consists of a prolonged regular season spreading 82 games over many months and lengthy rounds of playoffs. So why weren't the Lakers patient with the development process?The Lakers have always been a unique franchise owned by unique owners. Jack Kent Cooke assembled three mega-stars in the Forum -- Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain, and the team competed for the championship every year. They were colorful and talented -- ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" with mercurial Cooke as the ringmaster and they knew their market -- Los Angeles, Tinseltown. Los Angeles loves stars and spectacle. Movie stars are stars and we look for athletes to provide the same level of excellence and showmanship. Having grown up here, except for the Dodgers, we are a city of frontrunners, looking for the next hot happening.Jerry Buss knew this when he purchased the team in 1979 and he assembled his favorite team -- the one that ran ""Showtime."" Led by Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, the Lakers played electrifying fast break basketball and dazzled the fans. They had attractive, marketable stars, and their rivalry with the Celtics was magical. Coach Pat Riley was telegenic and flashy. This led to the first group of the nine NBA Championship that the Buss regime has aggregated. It also led to a move to the state of the art, more profitable Staples Center. The Lakers started to compete with the Dodgers for the heart of Southern California sports fans. The most expensive seats sold first, ticket prices were hiked dramatically and sponsorships soared. They were HOT!!! When ""Showtime"" aged a new cast of superstars replaced it. Jerry West arranged trades for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed Shaquille O'Neal. They had a massive MVP center with a charming personality and gift for gab and the best young player in the game. Phil Jackson, the best coach in NBA history added to the Championships. When Shaq left, they drafted Andrew Bynum, a talented young center, and traded for Pau Gasol, an all-pro forward.Jerry Buss has groomed his son Jim to replace him in day-to-day operations assisted by astute General Manager, Mitch Kupchak. Jerry has always understood the market he operates and insisted on exacting standards and goals. He expects the Lakers to have the opportunity to compete for the NBA Championship each and every year. They expect to have a roster starring the most accomplished, exciting players in the game. And they expect the team to play entertaining basketball. They charge the second highest ticket price in the NBA. The Lakers charge roughly $100 a ticket, which are premium prices. Their new local television package with Time-Warner pays them $200 million a year, arguably the highest in the NBA. And they knew the on-court formula necessary to trigger the fan frenzy necessary to feed all of their revenue streams.When the Dallas Mavericks swept the Lakers four straight in last year's playoffs the Buss family knew it was time to act decisively. They traded for veteran point guard Steve Nash who they knew could feed the ball to Bryant and power forward Pau Gasol and revitalize the offense. And they arranged a trade for the best center in the game Dwight Howard and shipped off moody and undependable Andrew Bynum. They viewed the early returns on Mike Brown's ""Princeton offense"" and the fact that they were 26th in NBA defense and went back to core principals. They decided that even if players adjusted to the new offense and started to win that it blunted the strengths of key stars and even worse, it was boring. Their payroll is the League's largest at 100 million, which gives them a luxury tax of $30 million. Against those economic realities they didn't blink at the prospect of buying out the last three years of Mike Brown's $11 million contract.Jerry Buss is 78 and wants to spend his last years watching the type of basketball that he and his fans love. Get ready for some SHOWTIME!"

You're not sure what to expect, but all your favorite women's magazines and websites, advice columnists and TV relationships experts are telling you that the fate of your marriage rests in your hands. Would you question Oprah if she advised you to ""accustom yourself, in deadly earnest, that he won't seem so wonderful when he returns as he did when he went away. Make up your mind that he will come back less than you expected, but that in the meanwhile you will make every effort to greet him with more than he expected. If you can do that, then any surprise is likely to be a pleasant one instead of a shocking one.""Or Dr. Phil if he suggested that you'd better prepare yourself because ""marriage with a veteran is a job and not a simple realization of fantasies""? What wife isn't going to get the message loud and clear: Only you can keep your marriage from ending in divorce.It seems incredibly unfair that marital experts would seemingly conspire to make the success of a marriage solely a wife's responsibility. But that's basically what happened to World War II brides, or so historian Kristin Celello details in her intriguing book, Making Marriage Work, which examines how Americans came to see marriage as ""work"" and that it was a job to keep marriages together.Of course, the above quotes aren't from Oprah and Dr. Phil; the former quote is from Paul Popenoe, a botanist-tuned-marriage counselor and creator of the long-running ""Can This Marriage Be Saved?"" column, and the latter is from psychoanalyst Therese Benedek; both were among the marital experts in the 1940s who set the stage for what was to only to intensify in the decades that followed -- the idea ""that a failed marriage was strong evidence of individual shortcomings, primarily on the part of the wife,"" Celello writes. ""In the ensuing years, the ability to hold a marriage together, for better or for worse, became the very definition of marital and wifely success.""Who knows if that's why World War II veterans had a much easier time transitioning back to civilian life than today's vets. But being married certainly isn't helping post-9/11 veterans readjust; in fact, ""post-9/11 veterans who were married while they served had a significantly more difficult time readjusting than did married veterans of past eras or single people regardless of when they served... being married while serving reduces the chances of an easy re-entry from 63% to 48%,"" according to the Pew Research Centers.Why? Deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan, the longest combat operations since Vietnam, added huge stress on many vets' marriages:""Nearly half (48%) say the impact was negative, and this group is significantly more likely than other veterans to have had family problems after they were discharged (77% vs. 34%) and to say they had a difficult re-entry. Among those married while they were in the service, about six-in-ten (61%) post-9/11 veterans who had experienced marital problems while deployed also had a difficult re-entry. In contrast, about four-in-ten veterans (39%) who reported that deployments had a positive or no impact on their marriage say they had problems re-entering civilian life.""Perhaps it isn't such a bad idea for spouses awaiting their return of their husbands and wives from Afghanistan in a few years to prepare themselves, as the war brides were instructed, although few are getting the help they need.Veterans are returning with a host of problems, everything from sexual dysfunction to post-traumatic stress. According to Pew, almost half of all vets (46 percent) say they're living with post-traumatic stress (PTS); the Veterans Administration puts the number between 10 percent and 18 percent and the Institute of Medicine says 13 percent to 20 percent have symptoms of PTS. Many more go undiagnosed.There's no way to know what that may mean down the road for the married vets with PTSD, but if it's anything like the experience of veterans who returned from Vietnam, we may see a huge jump in the divorce rate in the next few years. According to the VA, about 38 percent of Vietnam veteran's marriages ended within six months of their return. Vietnam veterans with PTSD divorced two times more than veterans without PTSD, and they were three times more likely to divorce two or more times.Of course, PTSD isn't the only challenge facing post 9/11 vets -- some 40,000 have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI) from combat (and tens of thousands more from non-combat). Brain injury brings with it its own complications, including drastic personality changes, all of which can challenge a marriage. Recent studies indicate that about 25 percent of those who have TBI end up divorced or separated. It's clear that some marriages may be yet another casualty of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.This time, however, it's unlikely wives single-handedly will be able to fix things.A version of this story appeared on Vicki Larson's personal blog, OMG Chronicles."
