1,WELLNESS,Yoga Can Disrupt the School-to-Prison Pipeline,"Robert Schware, Contributor

Bose, who started the non-profit Niroga Institute with a few yoga students in 2005. Niroga was asked to help work with a group of delinquent young women in an alternative high school in the San Francisco Bay Area, and from the first yoga class the Niroga teachers could see how these students took to the mindful action, breathing and centering (the ABCs) like fish to water. They seemed to connect with a place inside themselves that was safe from all the dysfunction around them.Today, Niroga conducts over 100 yoga classes a week in 40 sites throughout the Bay Area, serving over 5,000 children, youth, and adults annually, in mainstream and alternative schools, juvenile halls and jails, rehab centers, and cancer hospitals. It also conducts trainings for hundreds of educators, mental health professionals, and violence-prevention officials nationwide. In these trainings, participants receive help with personal sustainability (stress management, self-care, and healing from vicarious trauma), which also has a positive effect on their professional practice. Niroga teaches Transformative Life Skills (TLS: mindful yoga, breathing techniques, and meditation).Rob: What originally motivated you to do this work and what continues to motivate you? How, if at all, has that motivation changed over time?I learned yoga as a child, but my technical training was in computer science. While I was working as a researcher in Silicon Valley, I saw the ravages of chronic stress all around me. It was affecting the health, relationships, productivity, and global competitiveness of so many individuals and organizations. I knew about an optimal solution!So I became a student of chronic stress and its pervasive impact on individuals and communities. I learned that stress is not only a risk factor for most chronic diseases (which are responsible for 75 percent of our health-care budget), but it affects us all the way down to our DNA, accelerating aging and altering our gene maps (turning on disease-causing genes). Chronic stress is also a common effect of every major social determinant of health (e.g., income inequality, institutionalized racism, and the breakdown of traditional family structures). I also learned from the latest trauma research that we hold chronic stress, traumatic stress, and post-traumatic stress in our bodies as well as our minds. An integrated mind-body approach is essential for optimal healing.How can yoga become a game-changer in preventing school failure and reducing juvenile delinquency?Approximately one in two youths is dropping out of our inner-city schools. About a million youths are dropping out of school every year across the U.S. ... When a youth drops out of school it is very likely that he/she will be involved in crime and violence.Many of the children and youth who are at greatest risk of school failure come to school not ready to learn. They are dealing with the trauma of abuse and neglect, crime and violence, guns and gangs, drugs and death. We rush to teach them, forgetting that we need to heal them first. If we could bring optimal trauma-informed programs such as mindful yoga, breathing techniques, and meditation to enough children enough times, I believe we could reach a powerful tipping point. An efficient and cost-effective approach to doing this is by training the adults who are around these children (e.g., schoolteachers, counselors, and parents) in these practices. This would have a dual advantage: It would help the adults with their own stress management, self-care and healing from secondary trauma, and also enable them to create communities of practice in their schools and homes.Why should health professionals and school administrators know about Transformative Life Skills (TLS)?The latest neuroscience research shows that chronic stress disrupts our ability to hold attention and regulate our emotions; neuroscience also shows that mindfulness practices can mitigate these very effects.[1-4] Researchers have already established that self-control is a predictor of academic achievement, and that low self-control is responsible for a broad range of personal and interpersonal problems.[5],[6]Independent researchers studying the effect of Niroga's TLS among hundreds of youth in inner-city schools have shown that TLS lowered stress, increased emotion regulation, enhanced school engagement, and changed attitude toward violence.[8] I believe this has multi-dimensional impact on our school-to-prison pipeline, as well as on education equity and the achievement gap, since so many of the youth dropping out of school and ending up in juvenile hall are boys of color.In addition to the studies you cite above, is there an evidence base for your program in particular? What is the return on investment? As I said, there is compelling scientific research showing 1) stress affects self-control, and self-control predicts academic achievement; and 2) yoga/TLS lowers stress and increases self-control. So it is quite possible that yoga/TLS will affect academic achievement, and this needs to be researched. It will require getting yoga/TLS to a large number of youth randomly selected to receive TLS enough times (sufficient frequency and duration), and following their trajectories for several years. We are just starting to get interest from entire school districts to study just this. Of course, we see instances of transformation every day in our direct service programs in the community. When a young man is able to let down his armor of hyper-vigilance, when a young woman in a homeless shelter says that her constant emotional pain is eased through the practice, when opposing gang members are able to close their eyes and relax beside each other at the end of a practice session, when a high-risk teen graduates from an alternative high school and joins our teacher training program so that she can help pull her friends out of the quicksand of hopelessness, we consider these victories bread for our journey!It costs less than $1,000 to saturate a child or youth's life with TLS. If we applied TLS throughout our schools, and if the graduation rate could be increased by just 1 percent, the math is simple and clear -- we would get our money back many times over! What is the greatest challenge you face in bringing TLS to those who need it most?  There are so many misconceptions around yoga. Even with 20 million people doing yoga in the U.S., it is often perceived as socially elite. It is also often presented as a fitness fad for flexibility, or simply as stretching. So we call our program Transformative Life Skills (TLS), skills that nudge us towards healthy behaviors and healthy lifestyle choices, even as they transform us from the inside out. Anchored in mindfulness, connecting with our breath, we emerge in movement, so that the entire practice becomes dynamic, embodied mindfulness -- mindfulness in motion, or moving meditation. It is a universal, secular transformative practice, which anyone can do anytime, anywhere.Awareness regarding the power and potential of these transformative practices needs to grow among educators, health-care professionals, and violence-prevention officials. Thought leaders in these interconnected major domains of social function are just beginning to realize that these time-tested practices are evidence-based, validated by cutting-edge research in multiple disciplines. Long-term funding commitment is required, so that comprehensive research can be conducted to establish system impacts, such as high school graduation rate and the recidivism rate in juvenile halls.What are two key features of your approach to reducing stress and increasing self-control and resilience among at-risk children and youth?We believe that every child and every youth has infinite capability for self-awareness and self-mastery, to act rather than merely react, to achieve their fullest potential.We also believe that we are not trying to fix or help anyone, simply to serve them with love and compassion, unselfishly and unconditionally. Doing so is our privilege. We are thankful to those we serve, since each of them provides us with the opportunity to grow in many ways.What are some of your ideas about or hopes for the future of ""service yoga"" in America in the next decade?I dream about the possibility when most of the people in communities across the U.S. and beyond have access to these profound and powerful practices, so that they can act with self-awareness and self-mastery most of the time. Such access will transform ourselves, help heal our communities, and help make our fragile planet more sustainable for generations to come.None of us can do this alone. We will need all of our passion and compassion, vision and imagination. Yoga practitioners will need to extend their practice beyond the boundaries of their mats, bringing it from individuals to institutions, from classrooms to corporations, from jails to juvenile halls, building healthy and vibrant communities one breath at a time.Watch a short video on Yoga, Self-Control and Social Transformation here.Wake-up yoga community.Editor: Alice TrembourAre you a yoga instructor giving back to underserved or un-served populations?

But, before you install a bowling alley in the basement or a new wing to house the pickleball court, there are things to consider.

Lastly, your home will probably be inundated with every athletically inclined kid in the neighborhood, and they tend to get hungry and pilfer your freezer full of Bagel Bites.On the other hand, these courts and fields provide 24/7 exercise opportunities for energetic kids, and do wonders to ward off childhood obesity.

Bring marriage and kids into the picture and it's an even more tangled emotional web. You could dislike everything about your ex, and yet, right after you part ways they're on your mind 24/7. This is usually the tough cycle of any break-up and unfortunately, it has to take its course. However, there are some ways to speed up the process that I like to call my ""seven steps to purge an ex.""Now more than ever before, purging an ex is something people of all ages are dealing with. Divorce happens to people of all ages, and it's becoming more commonplace for older couples; break-ups are not exclusive to any one generation. As you get older, it's probably even more difficult to purge an ex. If you have children with your ex, you will undoubtedly be connected to your former spouse for life. However, while you never move on from co-parenting, you certainly have to move on to a new life for yourself. You finally made the leap to freedom, so it's time get over your ex and enjoy it. Following these steps may make that transition a bit easier. Step 1) Focus on your children: If you have children, focus on them in the wake of a divorce. This will not only help them, but it will help you as well. Their smiles can make any difficult day you're having brighter. Step 2) Don't text or call: Unless it involves your children, there is really no need moving forward to call or text your ex. You need to separate yourself and protect your feelings, especially if you can't seem to move on. A time-out in contact is important because time heals all wounds. If you're still upset from the divorce, a policy of no communication can help you move on more quickly.Step 3) Rid your house of his or her belongings: If your ex left anything behind, you probably want to return it. You don't want their belongings throughout the house reminding you of them. Look around the house and box up anything that your ex didn't pack. Then, head over to UPS and ship it to them. It's time to make your house yours. Step 4) Clean up your social media accounts: You cleaned up your house and now you should clean up your social media. If you have mutual friends on Facebook that were never really your friends to begin with, you may want to reconsider cutting ties with them. This is your chance to define your new life on and off the Internet. Step 5) Treat yourself: It's important to spend some time with just yourself after a divorce. Whether it's a 30 minute walk or something more extensive like a weekend getaway, some alone time is needed. Step 6) Accept all invitations: You have to go out and meet new people after a divorce. You may not want to start dating right away, but it doesn't mean you can't get out there and be social. Fun is a key to bringing your spirits up. So start accepting all invitations. Whether it's an invite to a movie or a gala ball, get out there and enjoy each and every moment with your friends. Step 7) Throw a divorce party: Throwing a divorce party is the ultimate moving on mechanism. These events are becoming more and more popular. I feel a divorce should be celebrated just like you would a marriage or any other important milestone in your life. Celebrate your new life with all of the people who were supportive during your divorce. For more healing divorce tips, pick up Lois Tarter's new book The Divorce Ritual by clicking here."

Building upon an impressive list of partnerships with institutions like Lincoln Center, the 9/11 Memorial and NYC Parks from the Broadcastr app, the SPUN team launched this geo-targeted news app last week that curates content from hundreds of local sources like the New York Times, Huffington Post, Gothamist, Eater, Humans of New York and many more. The app currently covers 11 cities in the United States including New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and others. In a way, the app is the reverse of Foursquare, focusing on content as the entry point, then location. The articles pulled by the SPUN editorial team are chosen based on uniqueness of content first and then cross-referenced for popularity. The best part is how the app navigates through an article. Take our piece on the ""Top 10 Bookstores in Manhattan."" The map at the top of the screen moves as you scroll down the article past the different bookstores. You can save articles and locations, which will pop-up the next time you're nearby, and share the content through your social media platforms. The app, developed in partnership with Apple, is driven by great imagery, and is the first we've seen to eliminate the pesky topbar on the iPhone. And a fun fact: the sounds on the app are created by Mikael Jorgensen of Wilco. Check out the Untapped Cities recommendations for the top 10 Bookstores in Manhattan and more on SPUN.

Since 2007 when Senator Barack Obama was merely a ""presidential hopeful,"" the fashion world has been intrigued (and to be honest, utterly enamored) by Michelle's bright patterns, vivid hues, kitten heels, wide belts, mixed prints and, of course, bare arms. The road to the White House was long but brought us some iconic fashion moments: the purple Maria Pinto sheath from the night Obama clinched the presidential nomination over Hillary Clinton; the red and black Narcisco Rodriguez dress from Election Night 2008; and finally, the green coat dress by Isabel Toledo, worn with J. Crew gloves on Inauguration Day.So when President Obama secured the Democratic nomination once again in 2012, we were just itching to get back on that campaign trail with Michelle. What would she wear? Luckily, she started things off right where she ended: in that purple Maria Pinto dress. What followed: a parade of sleeveless dresses in an array of bright colors and graphic patterns paired with low heels and flats (often in neon contrasting colors!). The brooches were back, as were the bared arms. Oversized pearls, uber wide belts and cardigans, on the other hand, are so 2008 and were noticeably absent.Starting with the Maria Pinto dress and working our way to November 6, 2012, here are Michelle Obama's best looks from President Obama's second and final presidential campaign.
