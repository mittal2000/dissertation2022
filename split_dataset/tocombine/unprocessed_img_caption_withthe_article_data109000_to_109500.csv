Perhaps the most successful documentary photographer in American history was Lewis Hine, who was born 140 years ago this week (September 26, 1874). His photos exposed the scandal of child labor as part of a national reform campaign. He may be less well-known than other muckraking journalists of his generation, such as Upton Sinclair and Lincoln Steffens, but his work was a key part of the Progressive Era reform movement that made America a more humane society.  The sky had not yet begun to brighten on a chilly February morning in 1911 when the first workers arrived at the seafood cannery in Biloxi, Mississippi. Slipping in after them was a slender man carrying cumbersome camera equipment. Hine was not allowed in the cannery. But he had no qualms about sneaking in at five in the morning, as he knew the managers would not arrive until hours later. He would return again at noon in a rowboat, tying up to the cannery dock, to get within striking distance of his subjects.One was Manuel, who, at just five-years-old, was already a veteran shrimp picker. In the photograph taken by Hine, Manuel is round-cheeked and round-tummied, with a serious expression. Barefoot, he stands facing the camera, dressed in a checkered shirt, short pants, and a soiled apron, wearing a fisherman's cap on his head. In each hand he holds a strainer pot. Behind him is an immense mound of oyster shells.Hine had traveled to Biloxi on behalf of the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC), a group formed in 1904. He journeyed to factories, mills, fields, and mines to document how America's children toiled. Hine was born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, above a popular Main Street restaurant that his parents owned. His father died when Lewis was seventeen years old. He worked as a hauler at a furniture factory, toiling thirteen hours a day, six days a week, to help support his mother and sister. But in 1893, during an economic downturn, the factory closed. He picked up odd jobs, splitting firewood and making deliveries. (Delivery boys were later a favorite subject in his work.) When he was hired as a bank janitor, he studied stenography at night and was promoted to secretary.Hine's life began to change when he met Frank Manny, who became his mentor, introducing him to the ideas of John Dewey and, later, Felix Adler, the founder of the Ethical Culture movement. Hine enrolled at the teachers' college in Oshkosh, where Manny taught, and then spent a year at the University of Chicago. When Manny became superintendent of the Ethical Culture School in New York City, he offered Hine a job teaching geography and natural history. While teaching, Hine completed his degree in education at New York University.The Ethical Culture School, founded by Adler, was progressive and experimental. It based its curriculum on humanist values that helped lay the groundwork for Hine's future work. Although Hine had never picked up a camera before, Manny suggested he become the school photographer. He took pictures of school activities, set up a dark room, and started a camera club. Manny used Hine's emerging photography skills to teach students about social conditions, in particular the conditions facing the waves of immigrants coming through Ellis Island. Manny urged Hine to portray the dignity and worth of the newcomers, in part to help counter a growing anti-immigrant sentiment. Hine, with Manny as his assistant, lugged his rudimentary photography equipment to Ellis Island. He never photographed people without their permission, and in the cacophony of languages, he had to pantomime his requests to take a picture. Using an old box camera, glass-plate negatives, and magnesium flash powder that he had to ignite manually, he managed to capture beautiful images of people just arriving from Europe. He returned to Ellis Island many times over the coming years, taking 200 photographs in all.After graduating from New York University, Hine began graduate studies in sociology at Columbia University. This prepared him for an assignment with Arthur and Paul Kellogg, who ran the reform-oriented magazine Charities and The Commons (later renamed Survey). They asked Hine to take pictures for the Pittsburgh Survey, a pioneering six-volume sociological study of conditions in that urban industrial city funded by the Russell Sage Foundation. Hine followed in the footsteps of documentary photographer Jacob Riis, who captured the squalid conditions of New York's tenements in his 1890 masterpiece How the Other Half Lives. But whereas Riis photographed his subjects as helpless victims, beaten down by an oppressive system, Hine sought to present his subjects as people with pride and dignity, often tough and defiant, who held out hope for a better world. Hine was known for inviting his subjects to reveal what they wished of themselves rather than trying to catch them or coax them into wearing expressions of anguish or emptiness. Historian Robert Westbrook credits Hine with engaging his subjects with ""decorum and tact,"" rarely taking candid shots but instead encouraging eye contact with the camera lens.Hine worked with advocacy organizations that were trying to ban child labor. One of his pictures is of a mother and her four children sitting around the kitchen table, in a New York tenement lit by an oil lamp, all making paper flowers. ""Angelica is three-years-old,"" he noted. ""She pulls apart the petals, inserts the center, and glues it to the stem, making 540 flowers a day for five cents.""In 1908, the National Child Labor Committee offered Hine full-time work as an investigative photographer. He traveled around the country, photographing doffer boys in cotton mills, cigar makers, coal breakers, cannery workers, berry and tobacco pickers, laundry workers, even glassworkers -- all under the age of 16. To gain access to factories and mills, he would pose as a fire inspector, a Bible salesman, an or industrial photographer. When that failed, he would linger at plant gates, asking children if he could take their picture. His years of teaching, combined with a gentle demeanor, allowed him to connect well with youngsters. In a speech to the National Conference of Charities and Correction in 1909 entitled ""Social Photography: How the Camera May Help in the Social Uplift,"" Hine argued that ""the great social peril is darkness and ignorance."" Social reformers, he said, need to expose the terrible living and working conditions that are invisible to many Americans. ""The average person believes implicitly that the photograph cannot falsify. Of course, you and I know that this unbounded faith in the integrity of the photograph is often rudely shaken, for, while photographs may not lie, liars may photograph.""Hine was a stickler for individual details, recording whenever possible children's names, ages, working hours, and wages. He was particularly moved by the young boys laboring at coal mines. Of their work, he wrote, ""It's like sitting in a coal bin all day long, except that the coal is always moving and clattering and cuts their fingers. Sometimes the boys wear lamps in their caps to help them see through the thick dust. They bend over the chutes until their backs ache, and they get tired and sick because they have to breathe coal dust instead of good, pure air."" While he was at a Pennsylvania mine, two boys fell in the chute and were smothered to death.Hine's photographs made visible the long-ignored plight of working children. They were used in brochures and booklets, news and magazine articles, exhibits and public lectures. His work played an important role in the movement to enact federal and state child labor laws (which were often paired with compulsory education laws to keep children in school), culminating in 1938 with the Fair Labor Standards Act, which included strong protections for children.Hine continued to document child labor for a decade. In 1918 he left the NCLC and went to work for the American Red Cross, traveling to Europe to document the lives of refugees who were uprooted during World War I.During the 1920s, wanting to focus on more-uplifting subjects, he began a series of portraits honoring American workers. His final major project was to document the construction of the Empire State Building. Although by then in his mid-fifties, he scrambled to dizzying heights to photograph work that he felt captured the uplifting nature of the human spirit. These photos were published in his 1932 book, Men at Work. In 1936, Hine was appointed head photographer for the National Research Project of the New Deal's Works Progress Administration. But the next year, when the Farm Security Administration hired photographers to document the working and living conditions of poor and working-class Americans, Hine was not among those hired. The project director, Roy Stryker, said that Hine was difficult to work with. In addition, Hine's approach of allowing his subjects to pose for the camera may not have been in sync with the other photographers' notions of documentary social realism.Hine's life ended in misfortune. Viewed as outmoded in a time when candid shots were in vogue, he could not find work. He lost his home and ended up on welfare, dying in poverty within a year of his wife's death. Only after his death (on November 3, 1940) was his work once again appreciated. Along with Riis, he is recognized as the father of documentary social photography, an inspiration to many younger photographers. Today thousands of Hine's images have been preserved at major institutions, including the Library of Congress.--Peter Dreier teaches Politics and chairs the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College. His most recent book is The 100 Greatest Americans of the 20th Century: A Social Justice Hall of Fame (Nation Books, 2012). Lewis Hine is one of the people profiled in that book. "

The Islamic State militants, who once relied on wealthy Persian Gulf nations for money, have become a self-sustaining financial juggernaut, earning more than $3 million a day from oil smuggling, human trafficking, theft and extortion, according to U.S. intelligence officials and private experts. The group, which has taken over large sections of Syria and Iraq, controls as many as 11 oil fields in both countries, analysts say. It is selling oil and other goods through generations-old smuggling networks under the noses of some of the same governments it is fighting: Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, Turkey and Jordan. (AP Photo/Manu Brabo, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13dd32600005200709e9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we turn to Syria and the Islamic State's massive oil revenues.News broke last week that U.S. intelligence officials believe the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has grown into one of the wealthiest terrorist groups in history. According to recent estimates, the militants are making as much as $3 million a day, most of it through the illegal oil trade. U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria this weektargeted some of the ISIS-controlled oil installations in an effort to curtail the militants' revenue stream. The WorldPost discussed the Islamic State's lucrative business with Luay al-Khatteeb, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution's Doha Center in Qatar and director of the Iraq Energy Institute. Al-Khatteeb warned that the returns of the trade have contributed significantly to the expansion of the terrorist group. U.S. intelligence officials revealed last week that the Islamic State group is making millions every day from illicit trade in oil. How did the group get to this point?It's been a gradual development. ISIS and other extremist groups first took over oil assets in Syria during the past three years of conflict there [between rebel fighters and the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad]. Most of the oil assets they captured are in the eastern part of Syria and many of them shifted hands several times. One day they are controlled by the Nusra front [the al Qaeda affiliate in Syria], the next by ISIS. However, as ISIS intensified its operations and expanded its reach in Syria and Iraq, most of the key oil assets in Syria came into their hands. When ISIS moved to Iraq in June, it seized control over Mosul and moved into other Sunni-dominated provinces: Tikrit and Anbar. It built on the experience it gained in Syria and added new oil assets in Iraq to the list it was already in control of in Syria. When the militants take over these fields, do they have the technical capabilities to operate them? The groups rely on the cooperation of locals, on the people who had been running these operations before. Having said that, the groups did suffer a significant loss of capacity. For example, ISIS is in control of 60 percent of Syria's oil production capacity. Pre-conflict, Syria's production capacity stood at 385,000 to 400,000 barrels a day, so 60 percent would be more than 200,000 barrels. But from what is being reported out of Syria, ISIS appears to only be producing around 50,000 barrels. The same thing is happening in Iraq. The capacity of the fields under ISIS control is about 80,000 barrels a day. The militants started producing around 20,000, increased to 40,000 and declined again after the start of the U.S. strikes and the joint operations launched between Erbil and Baghdad, between the Kurdish Peshmerga forces and the Iraqi army. It's also important to note that not all of these fields are staffed by ""ISIS personnel,"" but by other insurgencies or entities that are willing to cooperate with the group. Because of these different operators, the price per barrel varies from $20 to $60 maximum -- still well below the standard international price of about $90. Who is buying this oil?There are about 8 million people living in the territory ISIS controls that desperately need fuel and energy supplies, and the group is producing about 70,000 barrels a day between Syria and Iraq. That means that ISIS's first customer basis is the people. However, most of the oil needs to be refined. The crude oil is either refined in small facilities or exchanged across the border -- mostly in Turkey -- for refined oil products. The southern corridor of Turkey has thus become a gateway for oil products and illicit trading that contribute to transnational terrorism. Would it be possible to shut that trade down? The Turkish government says it's doing its best, but in reality it's very hard to control the 746 miles-long border. At the end of the day, we are talking about a region that is well known historically for illegal trading and thriving black markets. The difference since the start of the Syrian conflict is that this black market is becoming an instrumental player in the financing of groups such as ISIS. One would hope that U.N. member states, entities and individuals comply with U.N. Security Council resolution 2170 to cut the finances of ISIS, Nusra front and other Qaeda splinter groupsHow worried are you about the fact that groups like ISIS control significant oil resources?The returns of this trade have contributed to the expansion of these terrorist groups. At the beginning of June, most estimates said about 10,000 fighters had joined ISIS. Just 10 days ago, the CIA put the number at 31,000. It is now believed that the oil revenues have contributed significantly to the expansion of the recruitment. About 10 percent of them come from Western countries and could pose a potential threat to national security if those radicals return to their countries as sleeper cells.This interview has been edited for clarity.

""The policies they are suggesting are ridden with political agendas,"" Ramseur said, ""something that belongs in our curriculum about as much as religious agendas do.""The school board is expected to take up the curriculum proposal in early October.""The point of civil disobedience is to break an unjust law with the intention of bringing attention to it so that it may be rectified and made just,"" Ramseur said. ""Teaching students about that does not encourage them to become anarchists. It encourages them to speak up about policy and make the government serve the people, which is what our democratic republic was designed for.""""And that is something that I learned in Advanced Placement United States History,"" she added. ""The uncensored version.""Read the College Board's full statement below:The College Board’s Advanced Placement Program® supports the actions taken by students in Jefferson County, Colorado to protest a school board member’s request to censor aspects of the AP U.S. History course.

In Fact, It's Boring'",Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michele-bachmann-boring_n_5890646.html,,2014-09-27,"WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 14: Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) speaks at the Faith & Freedom Coalition conference, June 14, 2013 in Washington, DC. The Faith and Freedom Coalition is a group created by former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed, designed to strengthen the evangelical influence in national politics.

She not only supported a federal marriage amendment; she worked tirelessly as a state legislator in years past to get a an amendment on the ballot banning gay marriage in her home state's constitution. It finally got on the ballot in 2012 and was defeated. And then in 2013, Minnesota passed marriage equality. Now Bachmann seems so disillusioned she’s got only one word for gay marriage: “Boring.”Asked about gay marriage in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress at the Values Voter Summit in Washington on Friday, Bachmann said, “It’s not an issue,"" before walking off and adding, “In fact, it’s boring.”This seems consistent with what she told Meghan McCain two weeks ago in an interview: ""I think that was an issue, yeah. I think it was in the last election and the previous election, but I think, you know, it's changing now.” Asked his response to Bachmann’s comments, the American Family Association’s radio host Bryan Fischer, broadcasting from the Values Voter Summit, strongly disagreed.""Well, I’d have to know more about what Representative Bachmann meant when she said that,” he responded. “The debate is far from settled. We’ve got a long way to go. Unfortunately, there are people in the conservative movement who have sort of given up. There are even evangelical leaders sending signals that the battle is over, that the battle is lost. ‘We’ll never be able to capture the millennials. They’re gone.’ I think it’s way premature for that. You know, when the homosexual lobby was 0 and 31 [having lost at the ballot in 31 states on marriage], the gay lobby didn’t quit. They didn’t give up. They didn’t do it. They didn’t give up, and neither are we.” Update: An earlier version of this story quoted Representative Michele Bachmann saying of gay marriage, ""It's not an issue."" Rep. Bachmann's communications director, Dan Kotman, notes that Rep. Bachmann stated more fully, ""It's not an issue in this upcoming election."""

The assault reportedly lasted 27 minutes, and for weeks, her eyes were still red from broken blood vessels. The woman's lawsuit claimed the state allowed the inmate access to female employees, despite his violent past and the fact that he was transferred from another facility after attacking a female worker there. According to the Centre Daily Times, Kane's office filed a response to the lawsuit that read, ""Some or all of the damages plaintiff have alleged are in part, or substantially due, to the acts of third parties other than the answering defendants, and/or plaintiff acted in a manner which in whole or in part contributed to the events which led to the damages plaintiff has alleged in her complaint."" In other words, it was the victim's fault. The document was in Kane's name. But her spokesman told the Centre Daily Times that Kane didn't actually write it. ""She didn’t even know about this,"" said David Tyler, her spokesman. In a statement to CNN, the attorney general's office added, ""This initial filing should not necessarily be interpreted as meaning this defense will be pursued throughout the entire case. ... Attorney General Kane is disappointed that she was not made aware of this matter prior to the filing, and was saddened to learn that the filing implied that the victim somehow contributed to this crime.""Jennifer Storm, a victims rights expert, told CNN the Pennsylvania argument was unusual. ""It's not common legalese in rape cases,"" she said. ""And it shows a significant lack of sensitivity to not understand the harm this has done to the young woman and the re-victimization she's going through today.""And Cliff Rieders, lawyer representing the victim, didn't buy Kane's attempt to clear herself of blame. “My response is that we are all responsible for what our staffs do,” he said. “When it goes out the door and it has your name on it, it’s yours.”The Pennsylvania attorney general's office has faced a significant amount of criticism lately for allegedly having a hostile work environment for women. A woman who worked in the office under two of Kane's predecessors, including current Gov. Tom Corbett (R), said women were promoted less frequently than men, and executives would email around pornographic images. "

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ferguson-darren-wilson-wristbands-doj_n_5890436.html,,2014-09-26,"FERGUSON, MO - SEPTEMBER 10: Police block demonstrators from gaining access to Interstate Highway 70 on September 10, 2014 near Ferguson, Missouri. The demonstrators had planned to shut down I70 but their efforts were thwarted by a large contingent of police from several area departments. Ferguson, in suburban St. Louis, is recovering from nearly two weeks of violent protests that erupted after teenager Michael Brown was shot and killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson last month. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d75a210000d601c965c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Police officers on duty in Ferguson should not be wearing wristbands showing support for the cop who shot and killed an unarmed teenager last month, the Justice Department on Friday told police in St. Louis County. DOJ officials also said they personally had observed Ferguson police officers not wearing name plates, in direct conflict with Ferguson Police Department policy.A photo posted on social media during demonstrations in Ferguson on Tuesday night appears to show an officer working crowd control wearing a wristband that reads ""I am Darren Wilson."" That slogan is affiliated with a campaign in support of the Ferguson police officer who killed Michael Brown on Aug. 9, and whom protestors want to see arrested. A grand jury currently is weighing the evidence against Wilson, and the FBI has launched a separate civil rights investigation into the case.Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said the wristbands were ""not a statement of law enforcement"" and that he would have conversations with law enforcement agencies about officers wearing the wristbands.Christy Lopez, deputy chief of the special litigation section of DOJ's Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson on Friday indicating that Jackson had agreed to prohibit Ferguson officers from wearing ""I am Darren Wilson"" bracelets while in uniform and on duty. The letter said Jackson had said he would make sure the other municipal agencies working in Ferguson would prohibit their officers from wearing the bracelets as well.Lopez said St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar and Missouri Highway Patrol Ron Replogle had indicated to Justice Department officials they also would ban the bracelets.""These bracelets reinforce the very 'us versus them' mentality that many residents of Ferguson believe exists,"" Lopez wrote in the letter. In a separate letter that DOJ sent to Jackson this week that was released on Friday, Civil Rights Division officials asked him to make sure his officers were wearing name tags while on duty. Lopez had mentioned that letter in a meeting with St. Louis County residents earlier this week, and Jackson reportedly assured federal officials that officers would wear name tags while on duty.“Sometimes things are just so obvious that we feel like we can recommend a change right away,” Lopez said at the meeting. “In a democracy, people need to know who their police are.” Some social media users have reported that officers from other police departments assisting police in Ferguson still were not wearing name badges at protests this week.""Officers wearing name plates while in uniform is a basic component of transparency and accountability. It is a near-universal requirement of sound policing practices and required under some state laws,"" the letter to Jackson states. ""Allowing officers to remain anonymous when they interact with the public contributes to mistrust and undermines accountability. The failure to wear name plates conveys a message to community members that, through anonymity, officers may seek to act with impunity.""Police officers regularly ditched their name tags during protests last month, allowing them to operate anonymously and making it more difficult for citizens to hold individual officers accountable for their actions. Asked about officers not wearing name tags last month, Johnson said people were harassing officers online, while Jackson said that protestors would use an officer's name to taunt them. “It kind of reduces that personal taunt and allows us to be generic,” Jackson said at the time.Protests have heated up in Ferguson this week, six weeks after Brown was killed after Wilson stopped him and a friend because they were walking in the middle of the street.Jackson also apologized to the Brown family and protestors this week in a video released by a public relations firm working for the city. Jackson had been heavily criticized for releasing footage that showed Brown allegedly committing a strong-arm robbery at a convenience store shortly before he was killed.Another component of the Justice Department, the Community Relations Service, also held meetings with Ferguson residents this week in an attempt to sooth tensions in the area."

In the seedy underworld of methamphetamine, traffickers have turned to disguising the drug as a liquid to boost chances of smuggling it into the United States from Mexico without getting caught.(AP Photo/PARC Environmental)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2a86f2100003300c65135.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While Breaking Bad has given us a multiyear tutorial on methamphetamine in America, many questions remain for policymakers and social scientists. Is meth use a growing problem and an emerging epidemic? Is it mostly a rural drug or a West Coast phenomenon? How is it that some places in the United States seem to have little to no meth use while others are inundated? Are meth markets different from those of other illicit substances, and if so, how?Our four-year study of methamphetamine markets taught us that most of the questions about meth can be answered by understanding the dynamics of the relationship between meth markets and public policy. We found a complex, multifaceted, transnational industry. At one extreme, meth is produced in small batches for local use and sold to just a few people who know one another. At the other, we found a large, sophisticated business operated by international cartels that depend on locally known and trusted users, much like franchises, to sell their product to local customers.Our research was sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and our findings are reported in our recently released book, The Methamphetamine Industry in America: Transnational Cartels and Local Entrepreneurs, published by Rutgers University Press.We studied meth markets from the perspectives of the people who participate in them and the people whose lives are directly affected by them. We surveyed police agencies in every state, conducted in-depth interviews with narcotics detectives, informants, meth users and dealers, drug treatment and prevention workers, family service providers, and others whose lives intersect with the methamphetamine industry in more than 28 cities and towns across the United States.Alone or with a guide, we walked or drove through areas known to house meth users and dealers or to be places where meth transactions occurred. We attended community events where local citizens talked about personal and community issues and problems related to local meth use and markets. We toured the U.S.-Mexico border, guided by a member of the U.S. Border Patrol. Everywhere we traveled, no matter what type of market organization or operation dominated the area or how good or bad the quality of the product sold, we found that relationships and transactions in methamphetamine markets are always personal. Wherever we went and whenever we asked where we would go to purchase meth in the area, the answer was always the same: ""You can't. You have to know someone.""In an industry built on personal relationships, the picture of methamphetamine markets in the United States is one that is shaped, ironically, by the same regulations that were put in place to control them. We found that restrictions in the United States on the ingredients needed to manufacture meth resulted in a windfall for international cartels that seized this market opportunity, flooding the United States with high-purity crystal methamphetamine, and displacing small mom-and-pop meth operations in areas not previously penetrated by international traffickers. Nevertheless, we also found that local mom-and-pop operations are still thriving and even dominating in some areas, especially across the Midwest, where international operators have had less success opening new markets.Regardless of which type of market dominates in any particular area, people all across the country, particularly users and dealers and social service and family service providers, made clear to us that methamphetamine ""is a family drug,"" and challenged us that -- if we wanted to understand meth markets -- we also needed to understand the relationship of the markets to families and particularly children. In the smaller operations, meth is frequently cooked with children present and exposed to the toxic chemicals and fumes and to domestic violence. We spoke to parents and grandparents who had introduced their children to the drug in what amounted to a bizarre form of family bonding. We spoke to parents and grandparents who told us they had introduced their children and grandchildren to methamphetamine so they would feel closer to them. We met a mother whose daughter took over the family meth dealing business at age 14 when the mother became too sick from using to continue. We listened as family service providers told us that they were ""treating second and third generations"" of the same family, children and even grandchildren. One woman we met told us how her dealer exploited her addiction to meth to encourage her to introduce her children to him so that he might start selling to them.We were further surprised to hear stories told by former meth users across the country -- eerily similar, paranoid accounts of hiding in their trailers, peering out of slightly opened window blinds, fearing that they were being tracked by sensors used by police, paramilitary, or other extraterrestrial forces. Surveillance cameras, they were sure, were everywhere, inside and outside of their trailers. Worried that their TV sets, DVD players, and other electronic gadgets were wired and watching them, they tore them apart, piece by piece, then added them to the growing pile of other electrical equipment heaped on their front or side porch. Outside, they heard and hallucinated about seeing black helicopters circling above, paratroopers landing in their yards in camouflage army fatigues. They told of snipers, wearing orange ski masks, perched in trees surrounding them. Coast to coast we heard similarly vivid stories of users staying up so long on the drug that they reported staring the Grim Reaper straight in the eye. Breaking Bad may have gotten a lot of the story right, from the family nature of the drug to the penetration of the industry by Mexican cartels. Our research reveals new information about the personal nature of meth markets, the unintended consequences of legislation put in place to curb its manufacture and use, and the drug's terrible impact on children. Now the challenge is to move from understanding the phenomenon to addressing the problem with informed policy and practice. "
22,POLITICS,GOP Congressman Warns Of The Real Social Ill Destroying American Values: Marijuana,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-marijuana_n_5890784.html,,2014-09-26,"UNITED STATES - MAY 14: Rep. John Fleming, R-La., speaks during a news conference at the House Triangle on immigration reform on Tuesday, May 14, 2013 . (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d75c240000500098f66f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Conservatives are losing ground on the fight to keep marijuana illegal, a Republican congressman warned in dire terms at the Values Voter Summit. During a conference mostly focused on religious liberty, abolishing the IRS and promoting small government, Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) delivered a full speech on the ills of decriminalizing and legalizing marijuana. Fleming, a medical doctor, warned of a ""growing acceptance"" of marijuana -- a fact hard to deny, considering public opinion and state laws. Colorado and Washington state have legalized recreational marijuana, and 23 states and the District of Columbia have allowed the substance for medical use. ""The time for us to speak up on this issue is now,"" Fleming told the crowd of conservatives. Fleming linked marijuana to deaths and domestic violence and said legalization supporters spread lies that marijuana is not addictive. Most supporters don't actually say it can't be addictive.Of course, those ills apply even more so to alcohol. Asked about the comparison after his speech, Fleming acknowledged that there are problems with alcohol, but said it has been accepted by the culture for thousands of years, making prohibition ""obviously problematic."" The same social acceptance doesn't exist for marijuana, he said, echoing an argument he has made before.""If you and I accept the fact that alcohol is a problem and a danger, is it logical to say, 'Well, instead of having one problem, that we should have two problems?'"" he asked reporters after his speech. ""Why add a second one if one is already causing problems?""Fleming also dismissed the argument by advocates of legalization that it would allow states to collect significant amounts of tax revenue. A study released this month by personal finance site NerdWallet estimated that states would bring in a total $3.1 billion each year if they legalized marijuana. The congressman said that more revenue may come in, but the cost of dealing with health issues, larger homeless populations and other social ills would make legal marijuana a net loss. (Whether Colorado's pot laws have actually drawn more homeless people is unclear.)Fleming said he thinks efforts to keep marijuana illegal seem to be working -- at least to some degree. A recent study from the Public Religion Research Institute found that support for legalizing marijuana nationwide had dropped from 51 percent in 2013 to 44 percent this year. But Fleming lamented that marijuana supporters remain unconvinced that the drug is dangerous. ""I'll show them the real science, and they just don't want to believe it because quite frankly, they want to smoke marijuana,"" Fleming said. ""It's like if you're overweight. Who wants to cut back on eating when you enjoy eating? But it's still bad for your health."" "

Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA can impose its own plans on states that choose not to submit one, and can legally compel states to follow those plans.A dozen states have already filed suit against the EPA to block the regulation. ""I'm not naïve in thinking we're going to get 100 percent of states completely convinced that developing a plan is in their best interest,"" McCarthy said Friday in a meeting with reporters. But she thinks her agency can get most states to agree that ""the better thing for them is to do their own plans."" McCarthy also indicated that some states that have publicly objected to the original rules are nonetheless engaging in productive conversations about how to adjust them. ""I think the public discussion might be a little different than the roll-up-the-sleeves, technical discussions we're having around these rules,"" she said. The comment period for giving feedback on the new rules has been extended from Oct. 16 to Dec. 1, in order to allow affected parties more time to weigh in. McCarthy said the agency has already received more than 1 million comments.The EPA head declined to discuss a report released this week that indicated a 2.9 percent rise in U.S. emissions in 2013. ""I haven't seen that,"" she said. ""I know that we are getting ready soon to go out with a greenhouse gas inventory that hopefully will talk more in detail about that."" McCarthy, who attended the United Nations summit on climate change in New York earlier this week, credited President Barack Obama for his leadership on the issue, saying that his administration's support for the emissions rules have improved the international discussion about a new global climate agreement. ""I have been going to these meetings for a long time, and it was by far the most positive I have been to,"" she said of the summit. ""The actions of the president really seem to be creating a great atmosphere."""

Mike Bost, R-Murphysboro, argues gun legislation while on the House floor during session at the Illinois State Capitol Wednesday, April 17, 2013, in Springfield Ill. (AP Photo/Seth Perlman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d75b240000320057733c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Illinois state Rep. Mike Bost (R-Murphysboro) has made a name for himself throwing extraordinary tantrums during legislative sessions. But he doesn't appear to have contained his notorious temper to the statehouse, according to a review of court and police records obtained by The Huffington Post.Bost, who is running for Congress this fall under the slogan ""Passionate Leadership for Southern Illinois,"" has a lengthy history with local authorities, including some incidents that suggest ""passionate"" is a bit of an understatement.The earliest episode dates back to 1986, when a neighborhood beagle named Rusty bit Bost's 4-year-old daughter. The report filed by animal control officials indicates that the girl provoked the attack by chasing the dog. She ultimately had to get 19 stitches on her face. According to court records, Bost was displeased that authorities would not be able to deal with the 10-year-old dog immediately. So he got his handgun, drove to Rusty's owner's home, and shot the dog to death while it was penned in an enclosure.Neighbors were ""very alarmed and disturbed,"" according to the police report, but a jury eventually found Bost not guilty of breaking any laws. The local paper reported the case under the headline ""Area man acquitted in dog killing trial.""The documents also detail another alarming, more mysterious incident. Bost, a gun-rights defender who in 2008 voted against a bill to require the prompt reporting of stolen guns, did not report a gun that was stolen from his own home.In 2006, Bost's nickel-plated special edition .357 Rossi revolver was stolen from his gun safe. According to police records, Bost did not know about the theft until police showed up at his door to inform him that the gun had been used to threaten another man's life. Bost led investigators to the safe, and the firearm was indeed missing. It is unclear who stole the weapon and how it was removed from the safe, but Bost and family members suspected that the thief may have been connected to a 17-year-old girl who had stayed briefly in Bost's house. Bost told police that he usually did not lock the side door to the room that contained the safe. Other incidents found in the files are less distressing, but similarly portray Bost as an aggressive man whose actions often put him in conflict with others.While Bost once felt justified in shooting a dog to death, in later years, he wasn't too worried about his own dog roaming the neighborhood. Local police records show that neighbors were so concerned about Bost's pet scampering around their homes and the local school that they called police at least four separate times.Several people who encountered the lawmaker seem to have responded especially poorly to him, though the records do not indicate why. According to one report, in 1999 someone kicked in Bost's front door looking for him, but left when they encountered only his wife. Bost reported the incident to police. He also called the cops in 2009 after someone left a note on his car that was described as suspicious, along with a copy of the ""Narcotics Anonymous"" pamphlet.Along with a fairly typical assortment of traffic tickets and moving violations, Bost was also involved in at least two car accidents. In a 1996 crash involving his red Beetle, Bost was found at fault for failing to yield to another motorist.Bost's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, including questions about the stolen gun and what the string of incidents might say about the candidate.Bost's outbursts are a regular hit on YouTube. Perhaps most notoriously, while railing in 2012 against what he saw as unfair floor procedures, he punched at a stack of papers that he had flung into the air. At the end of that rant, he compared Illinois Republicans and his constituents to biblical Jews in Egypt, hollering, ""I feel like somebody trying to be released from Egypt! Let my people go!” And last spring, during debate on concealed carry rules, Bost smashed his microphone, prompting a Democrat to quip, ""We don't want someone like that carrying a concealed weapon.""Democrats have sought to portray Bost, who is challenging Rep. Bill Enyart (D-Ill.), as a fundamentally unsound person whose volatile temper would only make Washington worse. So far, they've used his infamous outbursts in at least two ads, in which they dub Bost ""Meltdown Mike."" "
28,WORLDPOST,Progress In Nuke Talks 'Extremely Slow',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran-nuclear-talks_n_5890506.html,,2014-09-26,"President Hassan Rouhani of Iran addresses the 69th session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters, Thursday, Sept. 25, 2014. (AP Photo/Jason DeCrow)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13de5240000680038215b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Louis Charbonneau and Parisa HafeziUNITED NATIONS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Iran and six world powers made little progress in overcoming significant disagreements in the most recent round of nuclear talks, including on uranium enrichment, Iranian and Western diplomats close to the negotiations said on Friday.Officials from Iran and the six countries had originally said a breakthrough in New York was unlikely on a nuclear deal to end sanctions on Tehran, although they had hoped substantial progress could be made in narrowing disagreements.That, the diplomats said, did not happen at talks this week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.""On the core issues we remain pretty far apart,"" a Western diplomat told reporters on condition of anonymity. ""On enrichment, we are not there yet. On sanctions, we are not there yet.""The diplomat said that Iran and the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China would likely meet again in the coming weeks, but no date and venue have been set. The negotiators have set a Nov. 24 deadline for an agreement.Iran President Hassan Rouhani said at a news conference on Friday in New York that the ""progress we have witnessed in recent days has been extremely slow."" Rouhani said, ""We must look forward to the future and make the courageous decisions vis-a-vis this problem.""Rouhani said any deal without lifting all sanctions against Tehran was ""unacceptable.""Iran and the six hope that a resolution of the more-than-decade-long nuclear standoff with Iran will reduce regional tensions and remove the risk of another war in the Middle East.At the General Assembly earlier in the week, Rouhani said a deal that ends sanctions will open the door to deeper cooperation on regional peace and stability and the fight against militants such as Islamic State, a group that has seized parts of Iraq and Syria. The United States has made clear it will not link the two issues.Israel has repeatedly threatened to use military force against Iranian atomic sites if diplomacy fails to defuse what it sees as the threat of nuclear-armed Iran.Iran rejects allegations from Western powers and their allies that it is seeking a nuclear weapons capability, but has refused to halt uranium enrichment, inviting multiple rounds of U.S., European Union and U.N. Security Council sanctions. Enrichment is a process of purifying uranium for use as fuel for power plants or, if enriched to a very high purity, for bombs.MISTRUSTSenior foreign ministry officials from the six countries and Iran began meeting in New York last week. They are trying to hammer out a long-term deal that would gradually lift sanctions against Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.Despite a generally positive atmosphere in the negotiations, the Western diplomat said neither side has much confidence in the other.""The level of mistrust is still pretty high,"" the Western diplomat said.French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters there had been ""no significant advances"" in the latest talks, prompting the parties to cancel a scheduled negotiating session on Friday. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif late on Thursday and again Friday to discuss next steps in the deadlocked negotiations, the Western diplomat said.In addition to enrichment, diplomats said the speed of lifting sanctions is a difficult issue, one on which Iranian and Western delegations have sharp differences.The Western diplomat said the United States and Europeans were prepared to lift their unilateral sanctions very quickly in the event of an acceptable agreement, but U.N. measures would be ended gradually based on Iran's compliance with any future deal.""What they would like to see is to get rid of the Security Council sanctions very quickly, immediately,"" he said. ""But this is not exactly how we think."" He added, however, that Iran was underestimating the speed at which the Western powers were prepared to move on sanctions relief if an agreement is reached.The diplomat said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who held bilateral meetings with top European officials in New York, had nothing to offer to move the talks forward.""There was nothing really new from him,"" the diplomat said. ""He said we should not miss this historic opportunity over a couple of centrifuges. And by the way, we think the same way.""Iran's enrichment program, above all the number of enrichment centrifuges Tehran would be permitted to keep for the duration of any deal, is one of the major sticking points.Rouhani, widely seen as a pragmatist, was elected last year on a platform of improving foreign relations. Rouhani and his government have adopted a more conciliatory stance compared to his hardline predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, conceiving hope there might be avenues to reach an agreement.The head of the U.S. delegation, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, said in an interview with Voice of America that ""I believe we are making progress."" But she added that there are ""still some very crucial decisions that need to be made.""The Western diplomat echoed those remarks, saying: ""We are expecting significant moves on the Iranian side"" if there is to be an agreement over the next two months.
