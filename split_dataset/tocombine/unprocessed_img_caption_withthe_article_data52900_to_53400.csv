0,ARTS & CULTURE,New York Times Commissions Literary Short Fiction Based On The Election,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nyt-chimamanda-ngozie-adichie_us_577406e9e4b0cc0fa1362e30,If Virginia Woolf wrote about Melania Trump ...,2016-06-29,"Adichie, who divides her time between Nigeria and the U.S., brings an awareness of the immigrant experience to Melania Trump's campaign story.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577414d81800002500fa317e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the literary field, there's been no shortage of Donald Trump material this election season -- of course, it's been in the form of erotic romance spoofs, doggerel poetry, and parodic picture books, until now. When The New York Times Book Review asked acclaimed novelist Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie, author of Americanah and Half a Yellow Sun, to pen a more highbrow piece of election fiction for the Grey Lady's pages, the result was a fictional account of Trump's home life. Adichie's story, ""The Arrangements,"" burrows into the mind of the presidential candidate's quietly supportive and stunning wife, Melania, a Slovene-American designer and former model who has been seldom heard from during his campaign.You can read the entire story over at The NYT, but here's a brief excerpt:She sagged suddenly with terror, imagining what would happen if Donald actually won. Everything would change. Her contentment would crack into pieces. The relentless intrusions into their lives; those horrible media people who never gave Donald any credit would get even worse. She had never questioned Donald’s dreams because they did not collide with her need for peace. Only once, when he was angry about something to do with his TV show, and abruptly decided to leave her and Barron in Paris and go back to New York, she had asked him quietly, “When will it be enough?” She had been rubbing her caviar cream on Barron’s cheeks — he was about 6 then — and Donald ignored her question and said, “Keep doing that and you’ll turn that kid into a sissy.”In an editor's note, The New York Times Book Review announced that a ""second work of election fiction -- by a different writer -- will follow this fall."" Who the other writer might be, and whether the series might continue after the second installment, remains uncertain. (As of the time of this writing, the Times had not responded to a request for comment.)If any 2016 election phenomenon demands a fictional treatment, however, Donald Trump's psyche is it. By viewing Trump's campaign, and his relationships with his children, through the eyes of relatively reserved Melania, Adichie lets us see his ebullient need for approval and attention from a slightly more sympathetic angle -- but one distant enough to be critical. Who hasn't wondered what the deal is with Trump's marriage to Melania -- his third -- and his advisor-level closeness with his children, like Ivanka? What does each of them really feel about his platform, the runaway success of his campaign, and the possibility of his presidency? It's rich ground for fictionalizing.Not coincidentally, Adichie opens with a nod to Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, a stream-of-consciousness novel about a middle-aged society wife who accepts her role in life but also nurtures certain doubts about it, and about the choices she made to get there. Melania, like Clarissa Dalloway, decides to procure flowers for an event herself -- a small move of independence that nonetheless leaves her marital arrangement undisturbed. Adichie, whose most recent novel Americanah delved into the experience of a Nigerian woman building a life as a writer in America, while still feeling a deep pull to her home, was clearly a smart choice for the series. A deft and psychologically acute writer, she brings a wealth of insight about living as an immigrant in the U.S. -- a tricky dynamic when considering Melania Trump is an immigrant herself whose husband is campaigning on a nativist platform. What's in the future for The New York Times Book Review election series? Commissioning fiction for specific subjects, events, and clients can sit uneasily with artistic purists. When Chipotle began paying literary writers such as Toni Morrison and George Saunders to pen mini-stories for the fast-casual Mexican chain's cups and bags, some were critical of the encroachment of branded content into the fictional realm. Shouldn't art flow naturally from authors' creative impulses?But then, there's a proud tradition of political fiction (think All the King's Men), and American readers may never have needed well-executed, deeply thoughtful political fiction more than they do now. So maybe we should just say thanks, and enjoy the insights."

""And their staffs were doing their best to provide what they could with the resources they had.""Clinton's response to the 2012 attack in Benghazi, which left Stevens and three other Americans dead, has for years been the target of criticism. That's despite several Republican-led probes largely exonerating her.House Republicans on Tuesday released the findings of their latest investigation of the attack. The report, which took a special committee two years and $7 million to complete, also didn't blame Clinton -- but some of her rivals can't seem to let it go.Stevens praised Clinton in response to the incident and noted that her brother had ""a lot of respect"" for the former Secretary of State.

There’s no indication of a Democratic wave in congressional races so far. And Americans are more united on gun control issues than it seems. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, June 29, 2016. OBAMA’S RATINGS WORLDWIDE ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN BUSH’S WERE - Richard Wike, Jacob Poushter and Hani Zainulbhai: “As he nears the end of his presidency, Barack Obama continues to enjoy a broad degree of international popularity. A new Pew Research Center survey conducted in 10 European nations, four major Asia-Pacific countries, Canada and the United States finds that half or more of those polled in 15 of 16 countries express confidence in the American leader…. previous Pew Research Center surveys have found higher international ratings for Obama than for his predecessor, George W. Bush. During the Bush era, opposition to U.S. foreign policy and rising anti-Americanism were widespread in many regions of the world, but Obama’s election in November 2008 led to a significant improvement in America’s global image. The shift was especially dramatic in Western Europe, where assessments of Bush were grim, but subsequent views of Obama have been remarkably positive.” [Pew]Americans don’t get such high marks from many Europeans and Asians - More from Wike, Poushter and Zainulbhai: “The survey also finds that international publics see a mix of both good and bad characteristics in the American people. Survey respondents were read a list of six traits, and for each one, were asked whether this is something they associate with Americans. On the positive side, half or more in 15 of 16 nations say Americans are optimistic, and majorities in 14 countries think Americans are hardworking (although relatively few in China or Japan say this). Americans overwhelmingly think of themselves as optimistic and hardworking. Nearly two-thirds in the U.S. (65%) also say Americans are tolerant, but international publics are less convinced. While half or more hold this view in Poland, Japan, Germany and Italy, most in China, Sweden, Australia, the UK, France and Canada believe Americans are not tolerant. Moreover, many around the world also associate negative characteristics with the American people. Half or more in 10 countries think Americans are arrogant and many say they are greedy. Interestingly, most in the U.S. say Americans are arrogant (55%) and greedy (57%).”  [Pew] AMERICANS TRUST HILLARY CLINTON OVER DONALD TRUMP ON TERROR THREATS - Dave Jamieson: ""According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday, 50 percent said they trust Clinton on terror, compared to 39 percent for Trump. Those numbers are comparable to the split in a March poll, before the gap narrowed to just 3 points last month, when Trump’s poll numbers rose in general. But after the mass killing at a gay nightclub in Orlando, that gap has widened once again. Far more respondents thought Clinton had a better overall response to the attacks, by 46 percent to Trump's 28. And an even wider margin said they thought she showed better temperament in the wake of the shooting -- 59 percent to 25."" [HuffPost] CLINTON'S LEAD INCREASES, BUT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A WAVE - Chuck Todd, Mark Murray, and Carrie Dann: "" Four months to go until Election Day 2016, and Hillary Clinton holds the early advantage in the presidential race. Our national NBC/WSJ poll shows her ahead of Donald trump by five points; the Washington Post/ABC poll has [her] up 12; and this morning's NBC/SurveyMonkey online tracking poll shows her leading by eight, Clinton's largest advantage in that survey. So that's the good news for Democrats. The bad news? It doesn't look like that advantage is translating into the building of a significant wave -- at least not yet, according to our NBC/WSJ poll. On a generic presidential ballot, 45% of voters prefer a Democrat to win the White House, versus 42% who want a Republican. (At this same time in 2008, by comparison, Democrats held a 16-point edge on this question, 51%-35%.) What's more, voters are split, 46%-46% over which party they'd prefer to control Congress. (It was 52% Democrat, 33% Republican in June 2008, though 45%-44% in June 2012.) What's more, voters are split, 46%-46% over which party they'd prefer to control Congress."" [NBC]AMERICANS ARE MORE UNITED ON GUN CONTROL THAN IT MAY SEEM - Samantha Neal: ""In the aftermath of the mass shooting in Orlando, Americans appear to be divided on the broad concept of gun control — but not on specific gun control measures, according to polls. In a recent CNN/ORC poll, 55 percent percent of respondents say they favor stricter gun control laws, while 42 percent say they’re opposed….Those differences in opinion may seem insurmountable. Yet the polls also reveal something else: Respondents are largely united in support of specific measures that restrict access to firearms. A vast majority of voters polled — 92 percent, according to the CNN/ORC poll — favor background checks for anyone attempting to purchase a gun. Eighty-nine percent of respondents in a CBS poll said they did as well. Nearly 9 in 10 voters support a law preventing individuals on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms, according to both CNN/ORC and YouGov….A key takeaway: Question phrasing matters. The term 'gun control' seems to be a politicized phrase that encourages a partisan response. Yet when polls ask about precise measures, Americans show overwhelming support for certain restrictions."" [HuffPost] BREXIT IS A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR INTERPRETING 2016 POLLS - John Johnson: ""First, remember that how questions are asked will affect the results. For example, in the US, the treatment of third-party candidates in the polling questions could create similar issues as the 'undecided' vote on Brexit did for British pollsters. It is important to pay attention to how results change when only Clinton and Trump appear in the polling, versus the inclusion of either a generic 'other' candidate or, perhaps more importantly, a named third-party candidate. Second, always guard against the tendency to over interpret support for a candidate without considering the margin of error....Third, unlike a referendum vote in the UK, the US Presidential election is based on the Electoral College....Turnout of key demographics by state (and especially in swing states) is what will really matter.

The authorities are going through CCTV footage, witness statements.""",2016-06-29,"Passengers embrace each other at the entrance to Istanbul's Ataturk airport, early Wednesday, June 29, 2016 following their evacuation after a blast.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Turkish investigators pored over video footage and witness statements on Wednesday after three suspected Islamic State suicide bombers opened fire and blew themselves up in Istanbul's main airport, killing 41 people and wounding 239.The attack on Europe's third-busiest airport was the deadliest in a series of suicide bombings this year in Turkey, part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State and struggling to contain spillover from neighboring Syria's war.President Tayyip Erdogan said the attack should serve as a turning point in the global fight against terrorism, which he said had ""no regard for faith or values"".Five Saudis and two Iraqis were among the dead, a Turkish official said. Citizens from China, Jordan, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Iran and Ukraine were also among the 13 foreigners killed.One attacker opened fire in the departures hall with an automatic rifle, sending passengers diving for cover and trying to flee, before all three blew themselves up in or around the arrivals hall a floor below, witnesses and officials said.Video footage showed one of the attackers inside the terminal building being shot, apparently by a police officer, before falling to the ground as people scattered. The attacker then blew himself up around 20 seconds later.""It's a jigsaw puzzle ... The authorities are going through CCTV footage, witness statements,"" a Turkish official said.The Dogan news agency said autopsies on the three bombers, whose torsos were ripped apart, had been completed and that they may have been foreign nationals, without citing its sources.Broken ceiling panels littered the kerb outside the arrivals section of the international terminal. Plates of glass had shattered, exposing the inside of the building, and electric cables dangled from the ceiling. Cleanup crews swept up debris and armed police patrolled as flights resumed.""This attack, targeting innocent people is a vile, planned terrorist act,"" Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters at the scene in the early hours of Wednesday morning.""There is initial evidence that each of the three suicide bombers blew themselves up after opening fire,"" he said. The attackers had come to the airport by taxi and preliminary findings pointed to Islamic State responsibility.Two U.S. counterterrorism officials familiar with the early stages of investigations said Islamic State was at the top of the list of suspects even though there was no evidence yet.No group had claimed responsibility more than 12 hours after the attack, which began around 9:50 p.m. (1850 GMT) on Tuesday.VICTIMS OF MANY NATIONALITIESIstanbul's position bridging Europe and Asia has made Ataturk airport, Turkey's largest, a major transit hub for passengers across the world. The Istanbul governor's office said 109 of the 239 people hospitalized had since been discharged.""There were little babies crying, people shouting, broken glass and blood all over the floor. It was very crowded, there was chaos. It was traumatic,"" said Diana Eltner, 29, a Swiss psychologist who was traveling from Zurich to Vietnam but had been diverted to Istanbul after she missed a connection.Delayed travelers were sleeping on floors at the airport, a Reuters witness said, as some passengers and airport staff cried and hugged each other. Police in kevlar vests with automatic weapons prowled the kerbside as a handful of travelers and Turkish Airlines crew trickled in.The national carrier said it had canceled 340 flights although its departures resumed after 8:00 am (0500 GMT).Paul Roos, 77, a South African tourist on his way home, said he saw one of the attackers ""randomly shooting"" in the departures hall from about 50 meters (55 yards) away.""He was wearing all black. His face was not masked ... We ducked behind a counter but I stood up and watched him. Two explosions went off shortly after one another. By that time he had stopped shooting,"" Roos told Reuters.""He turned around and started coming towards us. He was holding his gun inside his jacket. He looked around anxiously to see if anyone was going to stop him and then went down the escalator ... We heard some more gunfire and then another explosion, and then it was over.""AIM TO MAXIMIZE FEARThe attack bore similarities to a suicide bombing by Islamic State militants at Brussels airport in March that killed 16 people. A coordinated attack also targeted a rush-hour metro train, killing a further 16 people in the Belgian capital.Islamic State militants also claimed gun and bomb attacks that killed 129 people in Paris last November""In Istanbul they used a combination of the methods employed in Paris and Brussels. They planned a murder that would maximize fear and loss of life,"" said Suleyman Ozeren, a terrorism expert at the Ankara-based Global Policy and Strategy Institute.Turkey needs to work harder on ""preventative intelligence"" to stop militants being radicalized in the first place, he said.The two U.S. officials said the Istanbul bombing was more typical of Islamic State than of Kurdish militant groups which have also carried out recent attacks in Turkey, but usually strike at official government targets.Yildirim said it was significant that the attack took place when Turkey was having successes in fighting terrorist groups and mending ties with some of its international partners.Turkey announced the restoration of diplomatic ties with Israel on Monday after a six-year rupture and has been trying to restore relations with Russia, a major backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.One of the U.S. officials said there had been a ""marked increase"" in encrypted Islamic State propaganda and communications on the dark web, which some American officials interpret as an effort to direct or inspire more attacks outside its home turf to offset its recent losses on the ground.Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the probe, which they said is being led by Turkish officials with what they called intelligence support from the United States and other NATO allies.(Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt, Can Sezer, Humeyra Pamuk in Istanbul, Ercan Gurses in Ankara, John Walcott in Washington, Pavel Polityuk in Kiev, Bozorgmehr Sharafedin and Sami Aboudi in Dubai, Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza; Writing by Nick Tattersall; editing by Philippa Fletcher, Janet McBride)"
5,THE WORLDPOST,Turks Step Up To Help The Injured And Stranded In Wake Of Istanbul Triple Suicide Bombing,Sophia Jones,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turkey-citizens-istanbul-suicide-bombings_us_5773be6ee4b0352fed3e704d,"“It shows me that humanity isn’t lost,” said one woman working at a blood donation center where hundreds of people lined up until the morning.",2016-06-29,"A woman cries outside a forensic medicine building close to Istanbul Ataturk Airport on June 29, a day after a triple suicide bombing killed at least 41 people.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5773bfd91800002400fa2fd2.jpeg?cache=9pbtN1Xx1F&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISTANBUL -- It was 2 a.m. Wednesday, mere hours after the triple suicide bombing at Istanbul Ataturk Airport, when Hayati Kayan heard reports of taxi drivers overcharging tourists desperate to get away from the carnage. That’s when the young hotel owner decided he’d had enough. It was time to act.“I was so sad,” an exhausted Kayan told The WorldPost from his hotel’s lobby as he tried to process the attack that has left at least 41 people dead and 239 injured. “I thought, ‘We must help them.’”Kayan had an idea: He would offer a free, safe place to rest to any traveler coming from Ataturk Airport.“We are willing to help stranded passengers!” he tweeted. “They can stay at our hotel for free of charge.” Strangers, eager to help, began calling. And soon enough, 16 weary passengers would take refuge at his yellow-shuttered, blue-doored Suite Begonia.Kayan is just one of many Turks who have stepped up in the wake of the attack to help the injured and stranded. While the bombers sought to instill terror and hatred, many people here in Istanbul say they strive to do the exact opposite. “It was people who attacked people,” Erturk Erkek, a 28-year-old actor said by phone. “So people need to help people, too.”He spent all night coordinating online efforts to help find accommodation and transportation options for travelers evacuated from the airport. A handful of his friends and strangers headed to Istanbul’s iconic Taksim Square after they heard at least 150 travelers were stranded there after being dropped off by buses from the airport. Between Erkek and his band of middle-of-the-night volunteers, some of whom acted as translators, he says they helped find places for everyone to sleep. Like other Turks, he even offered his own place to strangers in hopes that the safety of his home could bring solace to their nightmare of a night. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Tuesday that initial findings suggest the so-called Islamic State carried out the attack, in which three suicide bombers targeted the international arrivals terminal at the normally bustling airport. But there has yet to be a formal claim of responsibility.At least 23 Turkish citizens and 13 foreign nationals from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, China, Iraq, Ukraine and Jordan were killed in the highly coordinated airport attack, according to a Turkish official. ISIS's hard-line fighters have been blamed for previous terrorist attacks targeting civilians and tourists in Turkey. The country, bordering war-torn Syria, was already reeling from a handful of gruesome attacks blamed on ISIS and Turkish militant groups this past year that have left the once-thriving tourism industry hanging on by a thread.Tuesday’s attack has only compounded worries that such shocking levels of violence are fast becoming the norm in Turkey.Following the massacre, the Turkish Red Crescent posted locations to donate blood in Istanbul on social media, a list that has now been shared thousands of times.

That’s when the young hotel owner decided he’d had enough. It was time to act.“I was so sad,” an exhausted Kayan told The WorldPost from his hotel’s lobby as he tried to process the attack that has left at least 41 people dead and 239 injured. “I thought, ‘We must help them.’”Kayan had an idea: He would offer a free, safe place to rest to any traveler coming from Ataturk Airport.“We are willing to help stranded passengers!” he tweeted. “They can stay at our hotel for free of charge.” Strangers, eager to help, began calling. And soon enough, 16 weary passengers would take refuge at his yellow-shuttered, blue-doored Suite Begonia.Kayan is just one of many Turks who have stepped up in the wake of the attack to help the injured and stranded. While the bombers sought to instill terror and hatred, many people here in Istanbul say they strive to do the exact opposite. “It was people who attacked people,” Erturk Erkek, a 28-year-old actor said by phone. “So people need to help people, too.”He spent all night coordinating online efforts to help find accommodation and transportation options for travelers evacuated from the airport. A handful of his friends and strangers headed to Istanbul’s iconic Taksim Square after they heard at least 150 travelers were stranded there after being dropped off by buses from the airport. Between Erkek and his band of middle-of-the-night volunteers, some of whom acted as translators, he says they helped find places for everyone to sleep. Like other Turks, he even offered his own place to strangers in hopes that the safety of his home could bring solace to their nightmare of a night. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Tuesday that initial findings suggest the so-called Islamic State carried out the attack, in which three suicide bombers targeted the international arrivals terminal at the normally bustling airport. But there has yet to be a formal claim of responsibility.At least 23 Turkish citizens and 13 foreign nationals from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, China, Iraq, Ukraine and Jordan were killed in the highly coordinated airport attack, according to a Turkish official. ISIS's hard-line fighters have been blamed for previous terrorist attacks targeting civilians and tourists in Turkey. The country, bordering war-torn Syria, was already reeling from a handful of gruesome attacks blamed on ISIS and Turkish militant groups this past year that have left the once-thriving tourism industry hanging on by a thread.Tuesday’s attack has only compounded worries that such shocking levels of violence are fast becoming the norm in Turkey.Following the massacre, the Turkish Red Crescent posted locations to donate blood in Istanbul on social media, a list that has now been shared thousands of times. Soon after came a message for those hurt in the blasts: You are not alone. Seemingly endless lines of people queued up at blood donation centers across the city well into the morning, according to several employees working at different centers.“We took blood from 400 people, but more kept coming,” said Ayse, an employee at one blood center on Istanbul’s European side, who asked not to give her last name because she was not authorized to speak to press.

The 42-year-old clothes seller turned rights activist divides his time in the Somali-dominated neighborhood of Eastleigh between detention centers, courtrooms and community meetings.He is available to help those caught up in police roundups get out of jail; to advise new arrivals on how to register with authorities; and to join Somali community leaders in petitioning the Kenyan government for more workable legislation to govern the lives of around 600,000 Somali refugees in the East African country.The already uphill battle took a turn for the worse in May 2016 when the government abruptly announced plans to close all refugee camps within its borders and decommission its Department of Refugee Affairs (DRA), effectively leaving unregistered arrivals in limbo.The government’s stance, although softened slightly by a partial reopening of the DRA, has been accompanied by a welter of alarming and often contradictory statements over the repatriation of refugees to Somalia. The specter of forced returns now haunts the refugees.“Just thinking about the idea of going back to Somalia gives us nightmares,” said Said. “My children were born here and they’re proud of that. We want our right as refugees to live in Kenya or to go to a third country legally.“Just give us that chance,” he pleads.Like many Somali refugees, Said fled to Kenya in the early 1990s after a vicious civil war consumed his home country, settling in Nairobi. His two biological children live with relatives in the Netherlands, but Said cares for seven more children, mainly nieces and nephews.Since the Kenyan ultimatum that says camps must be emptied by this November, much of the attention has focused on Dadaab, a complex of five interlocking refugee camps near the border with Somalia. But the fate of hundreds of thousands more Somalis who have moved to urban areas like Eastleigh, which is known as Little Mogadishu, also hangs in the balance.Kenya’s Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery chose the beginning of World Refugee Week to announce that urban refugees “must move to their designated camps to avoid conflicts with the law.”One in 10 of Kenya’s refugees have been formally documented in Nairobi and retain the right to live in the city, but many of them experience arbitrary arrest, routine extortion and police harassment.There are widespread fears of a repeat of the notorious Usalama Watch in 2014, during which thousands of Somalis were rounded up in an effort to force refugees out of the city. It was a violent and indiscriminate operation, according to the independent watchdog Human Rights Watch, in which many lost homes and businesses, some were raped and others died.“I know we are going to suffer,” said Said. “No one has advocated for those who died in 2014, those who lost their hands or legs, their jobs, their loved ones. It’s been forgotten. Please, please, we don’t want that to be repeated.”Kenyan security officials insist that the camps and refugee communities in the cities are being used as cover by al-Shabaab, an Islamic extremist militia that controls parts of south and central Somalia. The government has contended that Dadaab has lost its “civilian and humanitarian character” but delivered no evidence to back this claim.Activists, including Said, point out that the refugees have the greatest interest in keeping the peace and rooting out extremists. Many of them have fled areas controlled by al-Shabaab to protect their children from being enlisted.Somali participation in efforts like Nymuba Kumi, where a voluntary security monitor is appointed for every 10 households, are evidence of this determination. “We are ready to engage the government and help resolve any security problem,” Said insisted.Police harassment, the partial closure of the DRA and the subsequent xenophobic rhetoric has paralyzed entire communities, especially new arrivals who do not yet have access to documents.Far from a security burden, the refugee community has made an economic contribution to Kenya, experts argue. A report by the Life and Peace Institute found that ethnic Somalis had invested $1.5 billion in the economy in Eastleigh and account for 25 percent of Nairobi’s annual tax revenue. “Refugees, alongside local Kenyans, help drive that economy,” it concluded.The sheer size of the Dadaab complex, which shelters nearly 330,000 refugees, makes it the third largest settlement in Kenya. Billions of dollars in international funding to support Dadaab has created 10,000 jobs in the area for Kenyans, as well as an entire ecosystem of support services.“We are taxpayers, we work hard. We’re learning from Kenyans, yet we’re also contributing and allowing Kenyans to learn from us,” said Said.As many in his community keep a tense vigil to see whether the Kenyan government will go through with its public pronouncements, Said fears that some will choose the hard, illegal road to Europe, a choice he calls a “suicide mission.”There are already 1 million displaced people living in desperate conditions within the borders of Somalia and no end in sight to the long war waged between the country’s U.N.-backed government and al-Shabaab. As well as war, in recent years persistent droughts have led to famines that have killed hundreds of thousands of people.Eastleigh is a main departure point for Somalis making life-threatening journeys across the Sahara to the Mediterranean Sea. Somalis are consistently one of the largest contingents of these desperate people.“Refugees are leaving for Europe [from Eastleigh]. We know people who’ve died. No one wants to risk being killed with a bullet, but they will risk dying at sea,” said Said.“Fleeing from your death to go toward death is a decision; it’s dying with freedom and the hope of reaching safety. That’s being human.”Said Abdullah’s real name has been withheld for the sake of his security.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is making the case that the United Kingdom's Brexit vote vindicates his brand of economic populism.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5773daa21900002400218780.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"British voters' decision to leave the European Union in a so-called ""Brexit"" shows that Donald Trump can win if Democrats do not embrace bold economic change, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says.In an op-ed published in The New York Times on Tuesday titled “Democrats Need To Wake Up,” the Democratic presidential candidate elaborates on his initial reaction to last Thursday's Brexit vote. The analysis is part of Sanders' effort to influence the direction of a Democratic party that he will not represent on the presidential ticket.The Vermont progressive claims that the United Kingdom's nationalist -- and at times, xenophobic -- campaign to leave the EU appealed to the frustrations of British households struggling to get by in the global economy. American workers feel similar anxieties and are susceptible to a similar populist appeal being made by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.“Could this rejection of the current form of the global economy happen in the United States? You bet it could,” Sanders writes.“The notion that Donald Trump could benefit from the same forces that gave the Leave proponents a majority in Britain should sound an alarm for the Democratic Party in the United States,” he adds. “Millions of American voters, like the Leave supporters, are understandably angry and frustrated by the economic forces that are destroying the middle class.”To avoid such a scenario, Democrats should both “vigorously support international cooperation” and adopt policy positions designed to improve ordinary Americans' economic well-being, Sanders suggests. Among other things, that means combating corporate tax evasion, not signing trade deals that hurt American workers and cutting defense spending, he argues.“In this pivotal moment, the Democratic Party and a new Democratic president need to make clear that we stand with those who are struggling and who have been left behind,” he concludes. “We must create national and global economies that work for all, not just a handful of billionaires.”Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, responded to the Brexit vote by emphasizing the importance of having an experienced leader during tumultuous times.Sanders has said he will vote for Clinton, but has declined to endorse her or campaign for her. He told “CBS This Morning” on Friday that he will not endorse Clinton until she embraces more positions favored by his voters, like the $15 per hour minimum wage.The two campaigns are in talks to resolve their differences, Sanders said.Sanders’ surrogates have already secured significant policy wins in the largely symbolic Democratic party platform, including formal support for the $15 minimum wage, expanding Social Security and abolishing the death penalty. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a Sanders supporter on the platform committee, criticized the absence of some liberal priorities, but nonetheless called the platform “the strongest progressive statement to come from the Democratic Party in years.”"

Leaders have said the focus will be on getting a grip on migration, bolstering security and creating jobs and growth.""It's important to have this meeting of 27 because it will show the unity of the 27,"" said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, describing the British vote as a wake-up call for Europe.Sturgeon has said Scotland, where more than 60 percent of voters said they wanted to stay in the EU, does not want to be forced out of Europe by England, the most populous component of the United Kingdom, which voted to leave.She has raised the prospect of the Scottish parliament trying to block exit legislation, and alternatively holding a new referendum on independence.The Scottish Nationalist premier was to meet European Parliament president Martin Schulz first in Brussels to discuss the way forward. But the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who chairs EU summits, turned down her request for a meeting, his spokesman said.Diplomats said there was a risk that the high-profile welcome for Sturgeon, a day after Cameron's last EU summit, could be seen in London as an encouragement to secession, although EU officials denied any such intention.Cameron told European Union leaders on Tuesday that Britain's future relations with the bloc could hinge on the EU's willingness to rethink free movement of workers, which he blamed for the referendum ""no"".Juncker rebuffed that explanation for the vote, saying that successive British leaders had participated in ""Brussels bashing"" and should not be surprised if their citizens believed them.German Chancellor Angela Merkel doused any hopes that Britain might yet reverse its decision, warning against ""wishful thinking"". While she persuaded fellow leaders to give London more time to hand in its formal notice to quit, Merkel said Britain could not drag out the process endlessly and made clear that a new government would not be allowed to ""cherry-pick"" the parts of EU membership benefits that it liked.""Some think that Britain needs more time. I hear this, yes, but I think it strange. It's a type of surrealism,"" said Belgium's Michel.Cameron, who announced his intention to resign after losing the referendum partly due to concerns about immigration, told his last summit he hoped his country would maintain as tight an economic and political relationship as possible with the EU.""Britain will be leaving the European Union but we will not be turning our back on Europe,"" he told a late night news conference after a dinner at which he said many European partners voiced regret and friendship for Britain.EU officials and diplomats said the mood was coolly polite.The Conservative leader said he had reported with sadness on the outcome of the referendum, saying: ""People recognized the economic case for staying, but there was a very great concern about movement of people and that was coupled with concern about issues of sovereignty. I think we need to think about that, Europe needs to think about that.""In a veiled rebuke to Leave campaign leaders such as Boris Johnson, who is vying to succeed him, Cameron said Britons would have to understand they could not keep all the benefits of EU membership without the costs.""If you want the full benefits of the single market, you'll have to be part of every part of it,"" he said.Driving home that message, French President Francois Hollande said continued access to the EU's prized single market was dependent on accepting the so-called four freedoms of movement of goods, capital, workers and services.""If they don't want free movement, they won't have access to the single market,"" he said, adding that the City of London would no longer be able to act as a clearing house in euros.The European Parliament adopted a non-binding resolution on Tuesday demanding that London activate the EU treaty's voluntary exit clause as fast as possible. That would launch negotiations on withdrawal terms with a two-year countdown to departure.""Waiting for several months, as has been announced by you, Prime Minister Cameron, and taking the destiny of our entire continent hostage purely for internal party political reasons would be totally unacceptable,"" European Parliament President Martin Schulz told the British leader in the summit.""That would not mean stability - on the contrary it would mean prolonged uncertainty,"" the German Social Democrat said, summing up the fears of many EU partners.(Reporting by Svebor Kranjc;Writing by Alastair Macdonald and Paul Taylor; Editing by Noah Barkin and Philip Blenkinsop)"

There had been no infections, he said, since one locally transmitted case, the country's 14th, was reported on March 15.Cuba has called out the military to help fumigate, activated neighborhood watch groups to check there is no standing water, where the insects breed, instituted health checks at airports and other entry points to the Caribbean island, among other measures.A source in the health ministry, with access to epidemiological data, told Reuters last week that there was no Zika transmission.""We are all over it. Every time someone enters the country from Brazil or Venezuela or wherever and comes down with Zika, more than 20 cases so far, we isolate them and check their neighborhoods,"" the source said, asking not to be identified as the information is considered classified.The source has contradicted official reports in the past due to the individual's concern for public health.U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,300 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in mothers.The United States and Cuba signed an historic agreement last week to collaborate on health issues, including Zika, as part of detente begun in December 2014.Media quoted Health Minister Morales as stating that due to efforts to date, there were no reported cases of Chikungunya, another mosquito-spread virus, and that Dengue, endemic to the region, had been all but eliminated.“Dengue, which when we began our intensive campaign was present in 14 provinces and the special municipality of the Isla de la Juventud, today is present in only one municipality in Guantanamo province,” he said.(Reporting by Marc Frank; Editing by Dan Grebler)"
11,THE WORLDPOST,How Nigeria's Police Are Becoming Allies For Safe Abortion,"Elizabeth Dwyer, Women & Girls Hub",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nigeria-police-abortions_us_5773ef93e4b0eb90355d0822,"In Nigeria, where most pregnancy terminations are illegal, a women’s reproductive health organization called Ipas is harnessing",2016-06-29,"A police officer stands guard in Lagos, Nigeria, on May 1, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5773f2ec1800002500fa3088.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Nigeria, where most pregnancy terminations are illegal, a women’s reproductive health organization called Ipas is harnessing the power of the police to expand abortion access. Hauwa Shekarau, the group’s Nigeria country director, explains how.Each year, Nigerian women undergo 1.25 million abortions, with nearly all performed clandestinely, resulting in 500,000 women with health complications. Restrictive abortion laws ban the procedure except when prescribed by a doctor to save a woman’s life – in a country that has such low contraceptive access, only 10 percent of married women use birth control. Nigeria’s abortion law is based on the same 1861 Offenses Against Persons Act that governs Northern Ireland’s rules, which pro-choice advocates are protesting this week by using drones to deliver abortion pills.While Nigeria may not have drones, one organization is harnessing another unlikely tool for abortion support: the police.Ipas, a global nonprofit women’s health organization, conducts reproductive health rights training for police across West Africa. In Nigeria, it has established a strong relationship with the inspector-general of police, enabling it to transform hundreds of officers into allies for safe, legal healthcare for women. As a result, the officers are adding strength to a growing movement to change abortion laws and help save lives.Ipas country director Hauwa Shekarau explains the techniques that the organization uses to inspire police to see abortion through a woman’s eyes – and support her safe access to the health services she needs.Women & Girls Hub: Abortion is allowed in Nigeria only if the woman’s life is in danger. How does that work in practice?Hauwa Shekarau: The decision is actually the doctor’s to make – not the woman’s – and the way the law is crafted is actually quite confusing. Do you wait until a woman is gasping for air before you determine that her life is in danger?We found in the course of our work in Nigeria that medical doctors and mid-level providers who are trained and skilled in women’s health are shying away from providing services – even from post-abortion care that is within the law.When a woman who has gone somewhere to start the process of abortion and is rushed to the hospital with post-abortion complications, a lot of doctors say, “I don’t want to get involved.” This is because of the fear of the police who are constantly harassing and intimidating them, and using the opportunity to extort money from them.We felt that the police needed to understand the difference between skilled providers and the quacks – the ones who are actually killing women. We educate the police about the lifesaving services that the skilled providers are doing.Now with the police being supportive, being empathetic, providers are able to carry out their work so those women don’t die – without fear of intimidation or harassment.Women & Girls Hub: How do you transform police officers into allies for women’s healthcare?Shekarau: Through empathy and rights-based training. One of our training modules has to do with empathetic skills and another has to do with the human rights angle.In one key exercise, we give them two real-life scenarios they can identify with, with four options for them to pick from.We ask them, what would you do if you found yourself in this kind of a situation – as a person, not just a police officer?For example, you go for a walk, go to sleep, and then at 2 a.m. some thieves break into the house. It happens daily. After ransacking the house and picking up the valuables, three of them decide to have a go at the wife by raping her. You later discover that she’s pregnant. What would you do with that pregnancy? Many of them would choose to abort it. Then we remind them that the law says you cannot abort. What would you do? The reality dawns.Whether you are a police officer or not, you don’t live on the moon. You live in this country, the same one that all of us live in. Police officers are not immune to the challenges that other people have. Some of them have daughters, some of them have wives, some of them have aunties who are women who are facing some of these challenges.Sometimes when things happen to other people, it’s like it’s something far away. But when it happens close to home, then reality dawns and you begin to appreciate the magnitude of the problem.This has really helped them to clarify their values and become empathetic.When a woman gets an unwanted pregnancy, she doesn’t care about what the law says: She will do anything to get rid of it. As men, if the police have somebody close to them who faces that, they would even help ensure that she gets rid of it. This tells us that this law that we have is not responsive to the yearnings of the people. It shows that we need to change that law.Women & Girls Hub: How does the human rights training Ipas provides influence police officers’ approach to abortion law enforcement?Shekarau: Our rights-based training lets them understand that abortion is illegal, alright, but Nigeria has agreed to implement international, regional and bilateral human rights treaties that protect women’s rights and women’s health. We’ve signed and ratified the Maputo Protocol, for example, which calls for access to safe abortion care. If they understand this commitment that Nigeria has made, then Nigeria is duty-bound internationally to provide these services.They begin to understand the fact that, yes, the law is restrictive, but Nigeria owes the women of Nigeria some commitment to ensure their health is protected, that they have access to safe services and that they enjoy quality healthcare.Women & Girls Hub: As a result of Ipas’ training, do police officers become advocates for changing the abortion law?Shekarau: That is not actually the objective. The original direct intention is to get them to stop harassing and intimidating providers so that providers can feel free to carry out services without any fear of intimidation.We work to make them empathetic and see why women would want to go to a health provider to seek a safe service – and to make them understand that when women do not get safe services, the alternative is to go to a quack, and that can lead to their death.What we have discovered in the course of doing that, we’ve been able to change their mindset to the point where some of them become advocates. We didn’t set out for them to become advocates, but they turn out to be advocates – it’s like an indirect outcome of the training we have.Women & Girls Hub: What is the future of abortion legislation in Nigeria?Shekarau: This law, as it is in place now, is difficult to implement and it’s difficult to secure a conviction. At the end of the day, it’s as good as a dead law.In our legislative engagement, we try to bring in police officers to ask them to share their experiences. They’ve always said that, in their experience, there is indeed a need to change this law.We haven’t yet gotten a political win. The parliament sadly is mostly populated by men who don’t see the need for it, and then we’ve also had religious bodies who tend to stand in the way of these laws being changed. We are constantly engaging the process, advocating, calling on people. I know that it is just a matter of time; things will change.This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

Along with financial and logistical constraints, some closed clinics will need to be relicensed by the state.“Clinics don’t reopen overnight,” Amy Hagstrom Miller, president of Whole Woman’s Health, the lead plaintiff in the case, said in a conference call Monday afternoon. “We have a daunting task in front of us, determining whether and how we can reopen health centers.”In a 5-3 vote, the high court overturned restrictions passed as part of House Bill 2 in 2013 that required all Texas facilities performing abortions to meet hospital-like standards including minimum sizes for rooms and doorways and pipelines for anesthesia. The court also struck down a separate provision, which had already gone into effect, that requires doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of an abortion clinic.This means Texas’ 19 remaining clinics — of the more than 40 that were open before HB 2 passed — will be able to continue performing abortions. But representatives of Planned Parenthood and Whole Woman’s Health — two of the state's largest abortion providers — said there is no timeline on when the clinics that closed due to HB 2 will reopen.In the three years since Gov. Rick Perry signed HB 2, many of the shuttered clinics have sold their buildings or let go of their leases. Some had to surrender their abortion facility licenses to the state and will need to apply for a new one. They will also need to rehire staff and raise funds to acquire new medicine and equipment.“It will take a while to rebuild the care infrastructure that used to be serving people across the state,” Hagstrom Miller said.Some clinics may never reopen, ACLU Legal and Policy Director Rebecca Robertson said at a press conference Monday at ChoiceWorks, a former Whole Woman’s Health clinic that was forced to close in the wake of HB 2.“This law was litigated for three years, and in that time, we saw a lot of damage,” she said. “Some of those clinics are likely not coming back. It sometimes takes years to rebuild access that we had before.”Amanda Williams, executive director of the Lilith Fund, which provides financial assistance to women seeking abortions and abortion advocates, called the damage “irreversible.”Prior to the enactment of HB 2, there were more than 40 licensed abortion facilities in Texas. That number dropped by almost half leading up to and in the wake of enforcement of the admitting-privileges requirement that went into effect in late October 2013. A U.S. district court judge struck down the surgical-center provision in August 2014, just two days before it was set to go into effect.When that provision was briefly enacted on Oct. 2, 2014, by a U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, only eight clinics in Texas could provide abortions. Later that month, the U.S. Supreme Court put the ambulatory surgical center requirement on hold, effectively increasing the number of clinics that could provide abortions in Texas to 19.The Supreme Court decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt explicitly cites the admitting privilege provision in explaining the clinic closings.“In our view, the record contains sufficient evidence that the admitting-privileges requirement led to the closure of half of Texas’ clinics, or thereabouts,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the majority opinion. “Those closures meant fewer doctors, longer waiting times, and increased crowding.”The high court also found that the surgical-center requirement is unnecessary and does not improve women’s health and safety, as proponents of the law claimed.“When directly asked at oral argument whether Texas knew of a single instance in which the new requirement would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment, Texas admitted that there was no evidence in the record of such a case,” Breyer wrote in the majority opinion.While the historic ruling gives clinics that shuttered in the wake of HB 2 a green light to reopen, providers say they expect abortion opponents in state government to attempt to put up more roadblocks.“I don’t know what the tactics of our opponents will be,” Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said about Texas lawmakers on the conference call Monday afternoon. “I’m sure they’re going to try to develop some new ideas.”For more on this story, see how the Supreme Court ruled on Texas’ abortion clinic restrictions, how Texas lawmakers are reacting to the landmark decision, and what the ruling means for Texas women.

The vote, which must be reconfirmed before it's made official, came after Mayor Libby Schaaf and council member Dan Kalb argued that a coal export terminal would pollute the area, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.Environmentalists, who had ardently opposed such a project, hailed the decision.""Thank you to the Councilmembers who voted today to respect the will of the people and protect Oakland from dirty, dangerous coal exports,"" Brittany King, the conservation program coordinator for the San Francisco Bay chapter of the Sierra Club, said in a statement to The Huffington Post.Once the council confirms the vote on July 19, she said, ""we can finally get back to making a plan for the Oakland Army Base that will create good jobs for our community without sacrificing our climate and our health.""Had the measure been approved, the export terminal would have shipped coal from Utah to Asian markets, The Associated Press reported. But assistant city administrator Claudia Cappio last week urged the council to block the plan, citing ""significant public health hazards related to coal.""Cappio said the $250 million plan had the potential to spread dangerous coal dust over the area as millions of tons of the fuel made its way through the port in West Oakland every year. She also included a report from a hired consultant that said mitigation efforts to contain the dust -- namely, using covered railcars -- wouldn't work.Others warned that in addition to affecting the health of the community, any coal blowing off the railcars or spilled during loading could end up in the bay, smothering its wildlife, preventing fish from finding food and interfering with the ecosystem in countless ways.""The transport and handling of coal would not only have had serious consequences for the health of local communities, but also for the health of San Francisco Bay,"" Sejal Choksi-Chugh, executive director at San Francisco Baykeeper, said in a statement sent to HuffPost. ""There is no good reason to bring coal into our vibrant and thriving economy and undo the years of progress that we’ve made in cleaning up the Bay.""   Lawyers for Phil Tagami, the project's developer, argued that the project would bring jobs to the area. They also warned that a ban could violate contracts and open up the city to costly lawsuits. Such a decision would classify ""Oakland [as] not a trustworthy or reliable place to invest or do business,"" a letter sent to the council read.Lydia O'Connor contributed reporting.

Those numbers are comparable to the split in a March poll, before the gap narrowed to just 3 points last month, when Trump's poll numbers rose in general.But after the mass killing at a gay nightclub in Orlando, that gap has widened once again. Far more respondents thought Clinton had a better overall response to the attacks, by 46 percent to Trump's 28. And an even wider margin said they thought she showed better temperament in the wake of the shooting -- 59 percent to 25.Trump's initial response to the mass killing was a self-congratulatory tweet, thanking supporters for their praise of him ""for being right on radical Islamic terrorism."" Forty-nine clubgoers were killed and another 53 injured at Pulse nightclub on June 12, making it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, a U.S. citizen, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in a 911 call during the rampage. Mateen committed the attack with an AR-15-type semi-automatic rifle and a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, reigniting the country's debate over gun control. In the ABC-Post poll, Americans were split on whether assault weapons should be banned. Fifty-one percent said the sale of such guns should be prohibited, while 48 percent said it should not. But a vast majority of respondents -- 86 percent -- said buyers should be blocked from purchasing guns if they are on the FBI's list of people with potential ties to terrorism.The GOP-controlled Congress has declined to take up gun control measures following the Orlando shooting, prompting a daylong sit-in by Democrats on the House floor. Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

The Natural Resources Defense Council said Tuesday that 18 million Americans got water from systems that violated federal standards last year, according to federal data. And the environmental advocacy group said an untold number of water systems break the rules without landing in the Environmental Protection Agency's database of water regulation goofs -- including Flint.""Flint’s absence in the federal data system raises the question: If Flint’s extraordinary lead contamination problems are not included in the EPA’s official compliance data,"" the NRDC's report says, ""how many other municipalities’ serious lead problems are being swept under the rug by officials responsible for protecting public health?""An EPA spokeswoman noted it's up to states to notify the agency of drinking water violations by municipal water systems.""EPA recognizes there are ongoing challenges in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule and is working closely with states, who under the Safe Drinking Water Act are the first line of oversight of drinking water systems and take the majority of enforcement actions,"" the spokeswoman said in an email. The Lead and Copper Rule is the main federal regulation for limiting lead levels in public drinking water.Lead contaminated Flint's water starting in 2014. State and local officials failed to follow federal Safe Drinking Water Act regulations requiring water systems to add anti-corrosion chemicals that can prevent lead from leaching out of pipes that connect water mains to people's homes.Lead is an excellent pipe-making material that also happens to be a potent neurotoxin that can cause miscarriages and brain damage. As many as 10 million American homes get water from service lines at least partially made from lead, which was only banned from plumbing materials in the 1980s.As The Huffington Post has previously reported, the EPA didn't slap Flint with a Safe Drinking Water Act violation even after its failure to do corrosion control became clear last year. Federal law requires water systems to test for lead in samples from people's homes, and at least half the samples are supposed to come from homes with lead service lines -- but Flint didn't do it that way, essentially diluting the potential amount of lead in their sampling pool, contrary to the requirement.In January, three months after high levels of lead in Flint kids' blood had been exposed by a local pediatrician, the EPA issued an emergency order giving the agency more control of the situation. The city's water is still not safe to drink without a filter.The Natural Resources Defense Council's report said federal data show that in 2015, more than 5,000 community water systems across the U.S. violated federal regulations aimed at treating, monitoring and maintaining low lead levels in the water coming out of consumers' taps. Only 5.7 percent of the violations had been corrected by the end of the year, and just about 10 percent of violations were subject to any kind of state or federal enforcement action.""While Flint’s case appears extreme, make no mistake about it: Lead-contaminated tap water is a national problem,"" the report says.The EPA is currently in the process of revising the Lead and Copper Rule, with plans to release a draft revision next year.This article has been updated with comment from the EPA."

She also has a message for those GOP politicians who both have voted against LGBT rights and voted against gun safety measures, yet expressed sympathy for the victims.“Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida, walked on our blood-stained streets with people from the Hispanic community,” Sheehan observed of Rubio, who has been a vocal opponent of LGBT rights and even promised if elected president to try to overturn the Supreme Court's historic marriage equality ruling. “And he went right back to Washington – one of the few times he actually showed up for work – and voted against sensible gun legislation.”‘If this doesn’t change your heart?” she continued, not needing to finish the rhetorical question. “There were people from [Rubio's] office – it was [a staffer's] hair stylist who got shot and killed. This was a personal connection people from his office had with these young people. And he still couldn’t find it in his heart to do the right thing.”Florida's GOP governor, Rick Scott, like Rubio, has also opposed LGBT rights and even as recently as earlier this year signed anti-LGBT legislation.“My governor couldn’t say the word 'gay' -- until he was called out on it,” Sheehan commented, then broadened her critique to other Republicans. ""And I’ve called a lot of them out on it. I said, ‘How dare you come here to my city – our city – and stand in front of the microphone and take up space….You loaded those bullets with hatred, as far as I’m concerned.’”"

But by tamping down anxious feelings, could it be that these so-called ""anxiolytic"" drugs are blunting our empathy and rendering us less willing to lend a helping hand to those in need?That's the word from the scientists responsible for a provocative new study showing that lab rats given a drug called midazolam (MDZ) were less willing than untreated control rats to help release a trapped cage mate.""With the MDZ on board, they were unable to feel/catch/'contage' the trapped rat's distress and thus were not motivated,"" Dr. Peggy Mason, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Chicago and the leader of the research, told The Huffington Post in an email.She called the finding ""really amazing,"" adding in a videotaped statement (above) that ""in the context of today's society, which is a highly medicated society, where lots of people are taking psychoactive drugs that might blunt their experience of negative affect, our results would suggest that that will also blunt helping.""That sounds scary. But is it really the case?Dr. Norman Sussman, a professor of psychiatry at New York University Medical Center, isn't convinced. He said it's notoriously difficult to draw conclusions about humans from studies involving rodents or other animals. What's more, he said, midazolam is a powerful injectable drug that generally is used not for anxiety but as a sedative for surgical patients.""In every way you look at it, this study is not relevant to clinical experience,"" he said. ""There are too many questions about why it was set up this way. You can't draw very much from this at all.""For the study, which was published June 8, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, the researchers watched what happened when rats were placed inside a cage containing a rat trapped inside a clear plastic tube.Untreated (control) rats were quick to open the door to the restraint to free the trapped rat. But rats injected with the midazolam made no effort to open the door even though they could see and hear their trapped cage mate.It wasn't that the rats on midazolam were physically unable to open the restraint door. When it was chocolate chips instead of another rat inside the tube, the drugged rodents had no trouble opening the door to get at the treat. It was that they simply didn't care that the other rat was trapped.Mason said the new research might lead people to rethink their choices when it comes to coping with anxiety.""One approach is to dull or dampen uncomfortable emotions and another approach is to learn to tolerate these unpleasant experiences,"" she said in the email. While drug therapy might be a good choice for people with crippling anxiety, others ""may want to take a different approach given this information.""But Dr. Dolores Malaspina, another professor of psychiatry at NYU, sounded a different note. In an email to HuffPost Science, she said that even if certain medications do blunt empathy, ""suffering from an anxiety disorder has an even greater disruptive effect.""In any case, Sussman said, good medical care requires doctors to prescribe anxiolytic drugs only in the case of severe anxiety.Whatever the takeaway from the new study, previous research suggests that psychiatric drugs may be messing with our empathy. The popular painkiller acetaminophen has been tied to a reduced ability to show empathy, and certain antidepressants have been linked to indifference.Whatever."

""It's a little too technical for most of us, and sends us right to the dictionary."" Dictionary searches also spike when a common word is used in a uncommon situation. Last week, searches for ""surgery"" jumped following the assassination of British Member of Parliament Jo Cox, Sokolowski said. ""News reports indicated she had 'just left her surgery' when she was shot,"" he said. ""In British usage, it refers to leaving an appointment with constituents. It sent a lot of people looking for that word. We don't even use it in [American] English."" Other searchers are cyclical -- lookups of ""presumptive"" and ""caucus"" jump during election years, while ""plagiarize"" rises during the first two weeks of September, when school typically starts -- Sokolowski said. ""Androgynous"" spiked during the deaths of David Bowie and Prince, Sokolowski said. The word was used in almost every obituary for both stars. Sometimes, searches increase when readers want to know how to pronounce a word, typically a foreign one. ""'Faute de mieux' hits that jackpot: It's both an unusual term and one that requires help with pronouncement for phonetics,"" Sokolowski said. "

Chellie Pingree (center) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (left) are pushing a bill to standardize all those ""use by"" labels on food.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576a90cf2200002d00f8257c.jpeg?ops=crop_0_159_4928_2783%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans and Democrats have found something they might be able to agree on: Garbage is bad. That is, they agree that too much food is being tossed in the garbage. As much as 40 percent of all the food produced in America is wasted, according to a widely cited 2009 study that is now helping spur action on the Hill. Lawmakers held an incredibly agreeable hearing on the problem last month with the House Agriculture Committee. Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), who had previously introduced comprehensive legislation to tackle the problem, said she was mildly surprised to be invited to testify by committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas). “This Congress isn’t particularly active,” Pingree told The Huffington Post. “We just haven’t had a lot going on, so we were thrilled to have the opportunity to move forward on an issue that really is bipartisan.” Pingree said she’s hopeful that one of her proposals ― to create uniform national standards for labels on perishable food that say “best by” or “expires on” ― might be approved by Congress. Perhaps even swiftly, in legislative time. “We have some hopes this could be taken up this year,” Pingree said.A spokeswoman for Conaway said he’s not opposed to any of Pingree’s proposals, but offered no timeline for considering them. At a recent event hosted by Bloomberg Government, the congressman suggested he wasn’t in a huge hurry. “This is one of those great bipartisan, broad-support [issues] that nobody has to wait on government to fix,” Conaway said. He noted that leaders could reduce food waste in part through public education efforts ― like when President Barack Obama told people to sneeze into their sleeves, instead of their hands, to help prevent the spread of the flu. One food waste problem that could be eliminated by a better informed public, Conaway said at his committee hearing, is the reluctance of some businesses to donate unused food to charity because they’re afraid of getting sued. He pointed out that Congress passed a law in 1996 that protects companies from liability for food donations. Food waste is also perpetuated by consumer confusion. Available data suggest that most of the food that gets wasted is thrown out by the folks at home, who are often perplexed by the dates on the labels.Currently, the “sell by,” “best by” and “use by” dates stamped on food items don’t follow any sort of government or industrywide standard. They’re just suggestions from the food producers, and most of those dates address the food’s peak freshness, not its safety. But out of caution, many Americans will throw out food just because the “use by” date has passed.“Ironically, despite the original intention of increasing consumer knowledge about their food, date labeling has become a largely incoherent signaling device for consumers,” the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic and the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a 2013 report. The report cited research that found label confusion caused roughly 20 percent of avoidable food waste. Infant formula is one of the only food products with “use by” labeling subject to federal regulation, according to JoAnne Berkenkamp, a senior advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council. The date stamp indicates when the formula’s nutrient content degrades, meaning it will provide the baby with less nourishment ― although it’s not necessarily unsafe at that point. There are signals that the food industry, too, is open to new labeling standards. When Pingree and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) unveiled their labeling measure last month, honchos from Nestlé and the Campbell Soup Company joined them at a press conference. In the 1970s, the National Association of Food Chains had lobbied against a serious effort to regulate date labels, arguing that new rules would raise costs and discourage companies from voluntarily providing date information. This year, its successor Food Marketing Institute ― whose members operate 40,000 retail food stores across the country ― offered a more circumspect response.“We appreciate the work done by Sen. Blumenthal and Rep. Pingree in drafting the date labeling bill, and FMI continues to carefully consider the provisions included in this legislation,” FMI official Andrew Harig said in an email. “We look forward to continue working both offices to address any concerns the industry might have.”While food companies’ decision to use date labels would remain voluntary, the Pingree-Blumenthal bill would create a uniform national standard for any such labels in which “best if used by” would indicate food quality and “expires on” would warn that the food might actually be unsafe from that point forward.One reason the food waste issue is garnering some bipartisan interest is that it’s both relatable and solvable, said Berkenkamp. And fully solving it could save the average family something like $1,500 per year. “We can actually crack this issue,” Berkenkamp said. “We’re seeing some very positive early signs that food waste is being received as a nonpartisan issue that can appeal to both sides of the aisle.”More stories like this: We Waste An Insane Amount Of Food.

24,BUSINESS,Etsy Is Helping Redefine What Green Buildings Look Like,Jenny Che,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/etsy-living-building-challenge_us_57471d00e4b0dacf7ad42751,This is what Etsy's *actual* offices look like. Glorious.,2016-06-28,The library at Etsy's new headquarters in Brooklyn.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577138251500002b0073cbd6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In the ninth-floor library at Etsy’s new headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, the wooden coffee tables were built from sustainably sourced timber. Rectangular pots, made of reclaimed wood, hold plants that will feed off rainwater collected from the roof. LED lights hang over a striped gray rug that contains only natural materials. The paint on the walls, too, was vetted to ensure that it contains a low number of volatile organic compounds, which are released into the air and can cause breathing problems.Green-certified buildings are hardly a new phenomenon. The proliferation of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) designation over the last decade has meant that energy-conserving lights, solar panels and efficient thermal systems are common features in many office and residential projects. The materials used in the construction and furnishing of a building, however, are not always subject to the same rigorous environmental standards.The Living Building Challenge is trying to change that. A certification created by the International Living Future Institute in Seattle, the challenge pushes environmentally friendly design further by setting ambitious requirements for energy and water usage as well as for all materials entering a space. A building must operate fully on renewable energy, generated on-site, and supply its own water by collecting and treating rainwater. No object in the building can contain toxic “red list” materials or chemicals. Materials have to be responsibly sourced and have minimal carbon footprints. Buildings must be sustainable to the core, from the furniture to the internet cables.“This is about leapfrogging forward past incremental achievements and toward more holistic, high-performing buildings,” said Kathleen Smith, vice president of the Living Building Challenge. “What if buildings could make a place better than what it was before?”Because the extent of a project may be limited by municipal water and energy regulations, an office like Etsy's can still achieve partial certification by focusing on just some of the Living Building Challenge’s criteria. Currently, 44 projects have been certified by the institute, and over 300 others are in the design stages.At Etsy’s office in Brooklyn's hip Dumbo neighborhood, where employees just moved in last month, every smear of glue and finish on the tables were scrutinized to make sure they adhered to the materials standard of the Living Building Challenge. A small team vetted more than 1,500 items, even down to the screws for the bathroom stalls, for the $20 million building project as the e-commerce site eyes its potential role as a leader in sustainable office design.Thoroughly eco-friendly computers, though, are not quite within reach yet. Etsy’s office is lined with rows of Apple laptops, which are among some of the items not covered within the scope of the challenge.“You don’t get an opportunity to design and build new headquarters very often. We wanted to use that as a lever for change,” said Devon Leahy, who heads up Etsy’s sustainability and innovation initiatives. “The Living Building Challenge is a vessel for positive health and environmental change in the building industry, and that’s something we really wanted to be a part of.”Like most environmental initiatives, the challenge comes with a hefty price tag. The institute estimates that high-end projects that pursue Living Building certification could cost up to 25 percent more than a regular building. But efficient energy usage could help significantly reduce a building’s operating costs over its lifetime.“The future of green design has a luxury aspect to it,” said Peder Anker, an environmental studies professor at New York University. “Will it be for the rich? Initially it may be, but the hope is that this will trickle down and become standard practice for every building.”The Living Building Challenge aligned easily with Etsy’s commitment to sustainability, a core part of the company’s mission since its founding in 2005. As Etsy looked to ramp up its business and fulfill its role as a certified B corp, through which the company is committed to meeting social and environmental goals, the challenge also provided a way to trigger change in its supply chain and how materials were sourced.For the Etsy sellers and small manufacturers who produced about half of the furniture and artwork in the new office, adapting to the stringent standards was a learning process, since the Living Building Challenge is not yet a widely understood program. All the wood used, for example, had to be certified by the Forest Stewardship Council and salvaged or sourced from well-managed forests, forcing makers to pivot on the way they approached a table or cabinet.Etsy took an active role in helping its partners adjust. Instead of seeking out individual furniture firms that were already FSC-certified, the company obtained group certification for its makers and even some of their timber suppliers. Certification is costly and can be a problem when building individual wood pieces, designers say, because the FSC sector is largely steered toward flooring or large-scale architectural work.Etsy's project is already sparking some change, as its construction partners and material suppliers become more knowledgeable about these standards. One timber company dropped its minimum order requirement after working with Etsy, said Craig Montoro, whose two-person design firm First Third built around 100 desks and workstations for Etsy. “It’s a start at getting FSC suppliers aware that there are little guys that want to use FSC lumber as well,” Montoro added.Even small questions to commercial manufacturers about the materials that go into a product have helped to improve transparency in the market. Just as consumers now expect the food at their grocery store to be properly labeled, items included in the Living Building Challenge will be linked to tags on the International Living Future Institute's website, explaining the materials used to make each item. The institute fields a rapidly growing number of applications each day from manufacturers looking to change their materials to comply with new building demands.Etsy expects to add dozens of these “declare” labels to the online database, for items ranging from glass wall dividers to cork insulation panels.“The scope of this project is so significant that it can really make a mark in the construction industry,” said Justine Chibuk, Etsy’s capital projects manager.A lack of convenient alternatives to the materials on the red list, though, can add further hurdles for companies looking to certify under the Living Building Challenge. Among the banned materials is vinyl, commonly used to cover wiring, and designers have to find creative ways to get around it.“There is a kind of bias for natural materials,” said Michael Garrison, an architecture professor at the University of Texas, Austin who focuses on sustainable buildings. “Oftentimes it can eliminate certain materials that in fact could be healthy, extremely energy-efficient and don’t off-gas,” he added, using a term for the release of chemicals into the air.As the physical footprint of Living Building-certified sites grows, so has the complexity of the projects. When planning for Etsy’s office began nearly three years ago, the largest interior that had been certified under the Living Building Challenge was 20,000 square feet. Etsy’s headquarters is 10 times that size, and the institute is working on proposals for a mixed-use space and a tech campus that are each 1 million square feet.The growing visibility of the Living Building Challenge comes at a time when sustainability has become increasingly tied to the larger issue of social responsibility. As more companies turn toward clean energy and other sustainable practices, that mindset has also fueled innovation in physical spaces and design that can promote the wellbeing of inhabitants.Buildings, in particular, offer ample opportunity for designers to find ways to reduce energy costs and improve employee health.“Cities and organizations are worried about climate change and health, and are thinking about what to do to reverse trends,” said Karen Lee, a physical environment consultant who previously worked in New York City's health department. “We see there are increasing certification products that are out there to help guide those practices.”For many urban planners, green certification is only scratching the surface of a sustainable future. Designers say that smart buildings could be eventually as sensitive as human skin, responding to sunlight and adjusting for airflow and temperature. And, crucially, they could collect and funnel natural resources to inhabitants of other buildings.“We’re talking about buildings that generate more energy than they use,” Garrison said. “When buildings have a net positive use of energy and water, we’re seeing the transition from buildings being consumers to being things that harvest and distribute energy and water. That would be a profound change.”For Etsy, reviewing the various materials entering its new space proved to be among the toughest parts of the Living Building Challenge. Other features, including rainwater irrigation, rooftop solar panels and occupancy sensors that control how much lighting is needed, are things that have already been adopted by many LEED-certified buildings. Etsy has also added bike storage, showers and a breathing room, where employees can take meditation and yoga classes.The company’s twice-a-week lunch program, too, is getting a boost. Local caterers working with Eatsy, the company's cafeteria space, will have a bigger kitchen facility (in keeping with Etsy’s mission, all the food will be seasonal). Compostable plates will be replaced by real china sets, and the office already uses silverware and glass cups. Memorabilia from the old office can be found in every corner. Old desks decorated with glitter and polka dots were taken apart and repurposed into a spiraling wall installation. Mr. Grit, an eight-foot tall owl-like sculpture that serves as Etsy’s unofficial mascot, now greets visitors in the reception area.Employees have access to natural light and plants no matter where they’re sitting in the office. But it’s the craftsmanship embedded in the new space that adds a particular draw.“You feel the weight and the grain of the wood, you see the imperfections, and it really is so unexpected that it makes you want to touch it,” Elise Pereira, who manages internal communications, said as she ran her fingers over a handmade reclaimed red oak table. “It sounds cheesy, but it makes you want to do good work because there is good work around here.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to Etsy as a benefit corporation, which is distinct from a certified B corp."

And conservatives are not happy. Just minutes after the high court struck down a pair of Texas abortion restrictions, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton praised the ruling and used it to attack Trump, who said earlier this year that women who have abortions should face some sort of ""punishment"" if the procedure ever becomes illegal.""This fight isn't over: The next president has to protect women's health,"" Clinton tweeted. ""Women won't be 'punished' for exercising their basic rights."" Everyone held their breath for Trump's counter-jab -- but instead, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee stayed mum. Trump's silence on the ruling is odd, considering his monthslong struggle to assure skeptical anti-abortion activists that he's on their side. Just last week, Trump accepted the endorsement of Troy Newman, the president of the extremist anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, who has said that the murder of abortion providers is justifiable. Conservative pundits are now skewering Trump for his silence on the ruling. Leon Wolf, the managing editor at RedState.com, wrote a scathing tweet mocking the real estate mogul. RedState's Joe Cunningham called Trump a ""coward.""""Trump is unqualified to lead Republicans if he can't stand up for one of the most fundamental parts of the Republican Party platform,"" he wrote. Fox News contributor Erick Erickson also slammed Trump in an op-ed. ""Yesterday, the Supreme Court issued a decision propping up the abortion industry in America and giving it special rights against regulation,"" he wrote. ""And Donald Trump, supposed champion of the unborn, said nothing. ... Can the leader lead or must he be led on this issue? If he must be led on an issue about which he is supposedly committed, I would submit he really is not that committed to the cause."" Some anti-abortion leaders are being a bit more careful about condemning Trump, knowing that he may be the GOP's only alternative to Clinton -- the strongest abortion rights champion the Democratic Party could ever nominate for president. Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel for Americans United for Life, told The Huffington Post that Clinton's record is still in ""stark contrast to whatever Donald Trump does or doesn't say."" ""Donald Trump and his campaign are learning the issue,"" he said. ""I have no reaction to his reaction. It's a process."" A Planned Parenthood spokesperson disagreed that Trump and campaign don't know what they're doing. Erica Sackin, political communications director for the family planning provider's advocacy arm, said it's ""no surprise"" Trump is staying out of the issue. ""Donald Trump knows most of the country disagrees with him on this issue -- in fact, for decades the majority of Americans have said they want women to be able to access abortion safely and legally,"" she said. ""The more people learn about Trump's dangerous policies for women, the less people support him."" Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

And in a NBC/WSJ poll, 50 percent of respondents say they're concerned the ""government will go too far in restricting guns,"" while 47 percent say that authorities ""will not do enough to regulate access"" to the weapons.Those differences in opinion may seem insurmountable. Yet the polls also reveal something else: Respondents are largely united in support of specific measures that restrict access to firearms.A vast majority of voters polled -- 92 percent, according to the CNN/ORC poll -- favor background checks for anyone attempting to purchase a gun. Eighty-nine percent of respondents in a CBS poll said they did as well.Nearly 9 in 10 voters support a law preventing individuals on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms, according to both CNN/ORC and YouGov. The CNN/ORC poll also shows that almost 9 in 10 voters favor preventing people with mental health problems and convicted felons from owning guns.A key takeaway: Question phrasing matters. The term “gun control” seems to be a politicized phrase that encourages a partisan response. Yet when polls ask about precise measures, Americans show overwhelming support for certain restrictions.Most Americans polled also support other gun control measures, though to a lesser extent. About 6 in 10 respondents support a ban on the sale of assault weapons, according to the YouGov poll and a new NBC/SurveyMonkey poll released Tuesday morning. And a Morning Consult poll shows that more than three-quarters of voters support creating a national database with information about each gun sale. Partisanship plays a strong role in how Americans answer questions about gun control. The CBS poll finds that Democrats are more than twice as likely as Republicans to say they favor more gun regulation. Partisanship also affects how Americans view the impact of gun control — in the YouGov poll, 66 percent of Democrats say they think that gun control laws would have prevented the Orlando attack, while 72 percent of Republicans say they don’t think it would have done so.Historically, the perceived importance of gun control spikes after a mass shooting, but tends to settle back down after some time.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5772c7851500002a006c8a25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the aftermath of the mass shooting in Orlando, Americans appear to be divided on the broad concept of gun control -- but not on specific gun control measures, according to polls.In a recent CNN/ORC poll, 55 percent percent of respondents say they favor stricter gun control laws, while 42 percent say they're opposed. And in a NBC/WSJ poll, 50 percent of respondents say they're concerned the ""government will go too far in restricting guns,"" while 47 percent say that authorities ""will not do enough to regulate access"" to the weapons.Those differences in opinion may seem insurmountable. Yet the polls also reveal something else: Respondents are largely united in support of specific measures that restrict access to firearms.A vast majority of voters polled -- 92 percent, according to the CNN/ORC poll -- favor background checks for anyone attempting to purchase a gun. Eighty-nine percent of respondents in a CBS poll said they did as well.Nearly 9 in 10 voters support a law preventing individuals on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms, according to both CNN/ORC and YouGov. The CNN/ORC poll also shows that almost 9 in 10 voters favor preventing people with mental health problems and convicted felons from owning guns.A key takeaway: Question phrasing matters. The term “gun control” seems to be a politicized phrase that encourages a partisan response. Yet when polls ask about precise measures, Americans show overwhelming support for certain restrictions.Most Americans polled also support other gun control measures, though to a lesser extent. About 6 in 10 respondents support a ban on the sale of assault weapons, according to the YouGov poll and a new NBC/SurveyMonkey poll released Tuesday morning. And a Morning Consult poll shows that more than three-quarters of voters support creating a national database with information about each gun sale. Partisanship plays a strong role in how Americans answer questions about gun control. The CBS poll finds that Democrats are more than twice as likely as Republicans to say they favor more gun regulation. Partisanship also affects how Americans view the impact of gun control — in the YouGov poll, 66 percent of Democrats say they think that gun control laws would have prevented the Orlando attack, while 72 percent of Republicans say they don’t think it would have done so.Historically, the perceived importance of gun control spikes after a mass shooting, but tends to settle back down after some time. Support for gun control rose after the attacks in Newtown, Connecticut, and San Bernardino, California, but declined soon after."
29,POLITICS,Hardline Immigration Hawks Are Starting To Panic About Donald Trump,Michelle Fields,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-hawks-donald-trump_us_5772dfa3e4b0d1f85d479996,"Trump's fluctuating positions on his proposed Muslim ban and mass deportations seem ""kind of like barstool philosophizing.""",2016-06-28,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is joined by Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Jan. 26 in Marshalltown, Iowa.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has spent the week pedaling backward and forward on his immigration positions, leaving immigration hawks -- and some of his biggest boosters -- worried about the strength of his support for mass deportations and a blanket ban on Muslim immigrants.Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter and immigration hawk, told HuffPost he was perplexed by Trump’s series of unfolding positions.“He initially said he wanted to deport the 11 million people,” Arpaio said. “So you’re saying he’s now saying he’s not going to deport everybody who’s been here illegally?”Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, an influential think tank that calls for stricter immigration laws, said he was similarly concerned. “His instincts on a lot of these issues are correct. Unfortunately, since he doesn't know much about the issue, won't listen to his own advisers, and won't read his own immigration platform, he ends up veering from one thing to the next,” said Krikorian, who plans to vote for Trump. “This is just another example of Trump's weakness when it comes to policy.”Krikorian chalked it up to Trump's basic approach to politics. “He's just saying whatever pops into his head at any given moment,"" he said. ""It's kind of like barstool philosophizing.”Trump spurred headlines last week when he seemed to change his controversial stance on immigration by saying he would not deport undocumented immigrants en masse if elected.“President Obama has mass-deported vast numbers of people -- the most ever -- and it’s never reported,"" Trump told Bloomberg. ""I think people are going to find that I have not only the best policies, but I will have the biggest heart of anybody,” When asked whether he would still issue a mass-deportation order, Trump said: “No, I would not call it mass deportations.”Later, Trump seemed to recognize that his comments may have caused some concern among his supporters.“We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place,” Trump tweeted. “We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst,” he added.He addressed his comments on mass deportation, tweeting: “I have never liked the media term ‘mass deportation’ -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!”But Trump’s tweets only created more confusion. When read Trump’s latest immigration statements, Arpaio said he was bewildered by the policy shift and took issue with Trump’s claim that Obama has been tough on undocumented immigrants.""He can say Obama’s deported more people, but he sure is not deporting all the criminals in my jail who keep coming back for other crimes,” Arpaio, who endorsed Trump in January, said.""When we turn them over to ICE, almost 40 percent keep coming back to the jails I run,"" Arpaio said. ""I don't really think they're being deported, they keep coming back to my jails.""Arpaio was not the only influential immigration hawk trying to pin down Trump’s immigration stance. Roy Beck, the executive director of NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for stricter immigration laws, tried to make sense of Trump's comments. “There's no question that at one point he said something about deporting everybody. He's said a number of different things. He's not a professional politician that answers from his policy papers,” Beck said. “What he states in public is sometimes a shade of this, a shade of that.""Mickey Kaus, an immigration hawk and an ardent supporter of Trump, had little to say when asked by The Huffington Post about Trump’s immigration comments.“Am I worried Trump has fatally weakened on immigration?” Kaus said. ""Not yet.""Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who claims to have written parts of Trump’s immigration plan, declined to comment on Trump’s contradictory immigration statements. Conservative columnist Ann Coulter, a high-profile Trump supporter and anti-immigration conservative, did not respond to requests for comment. Trump also appears to have adjusted his proposed plan to ban all Muslims from entering into the United States.In December, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” While Trump’s campaign initially suggested the ban would even apply to American citizens who were Muslim, Trump himself quickly softened that draconian position.But on Saturday, Trump changed his position once again, saying he isn’t calling for a blanket ban on Muslims in the U.S., but rather a ban on people coming from “terror countries.” In the Bloomberg interview, he didn’t specify which countries would fit the label.But later that same day, Trump once again seemed to shift positions, telling the Daily Mail he’d even be open to allowing in immigrants from the so-called “terror countries.”“I don’t care where” the immigrants entering into the United States come from, Trump told the Daily Mail. “But they're going to be even more severely vetted if it's one of the terror countries.”Trump’s national spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, attempted to clarify Trump’s immigration stance in an appearance on CNN Monday evening. Trump’s ban, she said, wouldn’t be directed at Muslims, but would be a ban on all immigrants coming from “terror countries.”“It doesn’t matter where you’re coming from, except for fact that the terrorist nations, which is something he is adding to this policy to make it more clear, that if you are coming from a hostile nation and you can not be vetted, absolutely you should not come into this country,” Pierson said.Prominent New York state Trump-backer Carl Paladino took it a step further, revising history to suggest Trump never called for a ban on Muslim immigrants to begin with.“I don’t think it was ever a ban directed at religion,” Paladino said. “Expecting a clear definition is a little bit much in the middle of a presidential campaign.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57719a42190000250021825a.jpeg?cache=MByRQ08flf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most beloved children's stories of all time was the basis for a dazzling Pride celebration in New York this weekend. On June 25, Manhattan's McKittrick Hotel hosted the latest installment of its monthly ""Supercinema” dance party, which is billed as a ""one-of-a-kind nightlife experience told through a cinematic lens."" Fittingly, the Pride month incarnation had a ""Wizard of Oz"" theme, drawing revelers dressed as Munchkins, witches, flying monkeys and other characters that appeared in the 1939 film version of L. Frank Baum's classic tale. Guests at the Emerald City Ball were also treated to a special performance by ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" veteran Detox, who donned an Oz-inspired ensemble for the occasion. Currently home to the interactive theater smash, ""Sleep No More,"" the McKittrick Hotel lends itself easily to fantasy makeovers. Previous ""Supercinema"" events have paid tribute to ""The Great Gatsby” and ""Alice in Wonderland.”Party organizers felt that an ""Oz"" theme was particularly appropriate in the wake of the June 12 mass shooting that targeted the LGBT community in Orlando, Florida and killed 49 people.""The film values love, courage and intuition in the face of adversity -- essential tools in being able to survive and thrive in a world that isn’t always so pleasant towards and accepting of us,” Cesar Hawas, McKittrick Hotel's special envoy, told The Huffington Post. Like the movie itself, Hawas added, the party aimed to provide a ""perfect escape from a reality that for many of us can be so unforgiving and at times feel so relentlessly oppressive."" In keeping with that mindset, proceeds from the Emerald City Ball will be donated to the LGBT advocacy group Equality Florida and Everytown for Gun Safety, the country's largest gun violence prevention organization. The cause had personal significance for Hawas, who once called Florida home. ""As a former resident of Orlando and longtime fan and frequent of the Orlando gay nightlife scene, the incident at Pulse hit me very hard,"" Hawas said. Detox, who also hails from Orlando, ""brought a bit of hometown glory in the wake of tragedy and really made it possible for us to hone in on this as a celebration of life and diversity and love,"" he said.

But the show, which features music, lyrics and a book by Jonathan Brielle, focuses less on the author’s literary accomplishments and more on his nearly four-decade long, surprisingly sexy relationship with Nora Barnacle, his wife and muse.Matt Bogart was tapped by Brielle to play Joyce in the show’s first incarnation at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, California in 2005. Like much of America, the Broadway veteran (“Miss Saigon,” “Jersey Boys”) first encountered Joyce’s work in English class, but wasn’t aware of the author’s life off the page until he embodied the role 11 years ago.“I didn’t have any inkling as to the kind of writer, or the kind of man, that Joyce was,” Bogart, 45, said.As the actor delved into research for the role, however, he discovered that Joyce’s struggles with his Catholic upbringing – a point which “Himself and Nora” explores at length – had personal resonance. Like Joyce, Bogart was raised a devout Catholic, and briefly considered priesthood.“At one point in elementary school, I thought I’d possibly become a priest,” Bogart said. “I also realized that was going to be impossible because of other things I wanted to experience in my life.” He could also relate to Joyce’s eventual discontent with the Catholic faith. “There were times [since then] when I’ve gone through a kind of shunning of the church, the same way Joyce did. So I really did connect with that side of the character.”The show touts the relationship between Joyce and Barnacle as “the greatest love story never told,” and fittingly, Bogart couldn’t have higher praise for Whitney Bashor, the singer-actress who portrays the winsome, yet fiery, Nora.“We’re having a great time making out up there,” he quipped. “She’s an incredible woman and an excellent scene partner, and we’re just found a great chemistry together. She’s easy to love.”Though Bogart isn’t sure how well the intimacy of “Himself and Nora” would lend itself to a full-scale Broadway staging, he hopes the musical offers audiences a “full, unexpected journey” and showcases a new side of him as an actor.“You don’t have to know anything about Joyce to enjoy this show,” he said.Matt Bogart stars in “Himself and Nora,” now playing at New York's Minetta Lane Theatre through Sept. 4.
