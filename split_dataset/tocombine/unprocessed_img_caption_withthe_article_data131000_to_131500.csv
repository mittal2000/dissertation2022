0,DIVORCE,How to Deal With the #1 Complaint About Divorce Lawyers,"Nancy Kay, Contributor
Divorce Strategist, Realtor, Manager of Chaos",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-deal-with-the-1-co_us_5b9dcdd3e4b03a1dcc8d19d5,"Although most people remember to ask a divorce lawyer how much they charge per hour and how much experience they have with divorce cases, there is something even more critical that you should find out as early as possible:",2014-01-23,2014-01-22-MovingForwardThroughDivorceDisagreement.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-01-22-MovingForwardThroughDivorceDisagreement-thumb.jpg,"  Are you considering hiring a divorce lawyer to guide you through divorce? January through March is typically the very busiest time for divorce lawyers when it comes to taking on new clients and starting them through the legal process.Although most people remember to ask a divorce lawyer how much they charge per hour and how much experience they have with divorce cases, there is something even more critical that you should find out as early as possible:Does this divorce lawyer really have enough time for me?  Just how soon will your divorce lawyer respond to your phone calls, emails and requests for an in person meeting? And once you have gone ahead and handed over your signed agreement and credit card for that large retainer for their representation, how soon will your lawyer return your urgent phone calls? Will your divorce lawyer return your calls the same day themselves or will office support staff be assigned to handle them instead? Will your attorney read and respond directly to your emails? You deserve to know, especially since so many divorces drag on between one to two years as they slowly slog their way through the overcrowded court system. When court dates are scheduled 4 to 6 months apart each time and any missing paperwork or last minute cancellations by the clients, attorneys or judge can set your timeline back further.The ability to communicate in a timely and responsive way back and forth with your divorce lawyer is critical. When communication breaks down or is dealt with too late, both clients and their attorneys experience a great deal of frustration and anger that leads to further problems and often more time and expenses as well.As Cool Hand Luke discovered the hard way, ""What we got here...is failure to communicate.""When I was going through my own tidal wave of divorce, having my divorce attorney's cell phone number often provided a much needed lifeline when my emotional sanity was hanging by a fraying thread. Dealing with missing money, ongoing threats and parenting time disagreements did not just happen on week days between 9 and 5. Holidays and weekends were prime times for these nerve-wracking situations to surface and raw emotions took center stage. Sometimes when my patience was at its lowest point, a quick return call from my divorce lawyer made a significant difference in how quickly these frustrating and anger-charged money or parenting situations were resolved.Following my divorce, I became a paralegal through a law school program and learned many of the ins and outs of the legal world. While working as a paralegal for several divorce attorneys, I saw firsthand how often each of them zigzagged in and out each week day, leaving a bare bones office staff to deal with urgent phone messages, flurries of emails and over-stuffed client files filled with critical evidence and legal motions that were time sensitive.Where were the lawyers when all this was going on? Since divorces are usually filed in the county courts based on where each client lives or works, the lawyers I worked for handled divorces within a six county range in and around Columbus, Ohio so they were usually either in a court room between 9 and 5 or in their car driving to another county court house to represent another client. And if a case did not settle and went to trial, a trial could go on for several days, pushing their hectic schedules back further.When the recession fully took hold in 2008, many lawyers cut back even more on their number of employees, anticipating a decrease in the number of new clients who were able to pay their fees for divorce.This shortage in legal staffing will soon cause even more headaches for both current and future clients. ""Not only did the ranks of the legal profession diminish by 4 percent from 2007 to 2011, but hiring is still sluggish, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And lawyers may soon have even less time for each client, because some experts expect the divorce rate to spike in the near future. If the economy continues to rebound, those who put their divorces on hold during the recession -- an estimated 38 percent of currently married Americans -- may now go through with them, says W. Bradford Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project.""What can you do to prevent this failure to communicate from happening to you?• Get communication procedures in writing from the lawyer before paying their retainer • When contacting your lawyer, be specific and stick to the facts of what is going on so that they can help you more quickly • Ask up-front to find out exactly who will respond to your calls, emails and office visits and how much staff support is available for their number of current clients • Choose a divorce lawyer who you align with well on a gut level so that you'll have a better chance of communicating effectively  • Ask around in your community to find former clients so you can ask them directly about how quickly the attorney responded to their needs • Find out if the divorce lawyer will give you their cell phone number in case of emergencies and what specifically is considered an emergencyGoing through separation and divorce is hard enough. Be sure that the money you are paying in goes to a divorce lawyer who won't take 3 days to respond to your important phone call."

Mother, wife and blogger, Sleep Deprivation Diaries",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/im-not-sorry_us_5b9dca01e4b03a1dcc8ce3dd,"I'm not sorry to be lucky enough to be Aaron, Scarlet and Owen's mother.  It is my life's greatest gift and an honor. Full of challenges? Yes, but worth every moment.",2014-01-23,2014-01-15-882283_171012666383045_1074099976_o1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-01-15-882283_171012666383045_1074099976_o1-thumb.jpg,"Tonight I got out for a little while alone to get my eyebrows waxed. The girl doing the waxing started making small talk and the conversation came around to my kids. She asked me ""do they go to school?"" and whatnot. I told her yes, my son goes to a special ed preschool and likely my daughter will this fall. She inquired as to why and then I explained that Aaron and Scarlet are both on the autism spectrum. That my son goes to a special preschool to get the services he needs and loves it. I told her how he lights up when he sees his teacher. I smiled and spoke with excitement and happiness as I said this. Then I got ""I'm sorry'd."" I've gotten it before many times and it bothers me. I know people don't know what to say and then say the wrong thing. I have put my foot in my mouth before. This girl took it to a whole new level:""Oh my God! I am so sorry, Courtney. How awful is that! Do they even talk? Will they ever be normal? I cannot even imagine how awful that would be. Did you know when you were pregnant? Is your youngest child at least normal or does he have it too? Hopefully he will end up being healthy.""Stunned. Speechless. Dumbfounded. Why? I should be used to this by now. I explain how awesome they are and what a joy it is to be their mom. I try my best to answer questions in a way that helps educate her a little and let her know that I don't need pity. I tell her cute things they have done that cracked me up lately. Unabated, she continues, ""I have a good friend who has a son with autism. I feel so sorry for you and for her. It's just awful."" (Seriously? Do you say this stuff to her? Are you sure she's still your friend?)Here's the thing, and let me be really clear:I'M NOT SORRY. I'm not sorry to be lucky enough to be Aaron, Scarlet and Owen's mother. It is my life's greatest gift and an honor. Full of challenges? Yes, but worth every moment.There is no such thing as normal. Sorry to burst your bubble. We are all dealing with issues, maybe they don't all have a name or a diagnosis. Every single person, adult and child, struggles with something. Some have a diagnosis of some kind, some don't. I don't need your sorrow or pity. Is it hard? Yes. Parenting is hard. Life is hard sometimes. Throw in special needs or medical issues and it gets even tougher. I do what we all do. I show up and I love my kids and do everything possible for them. I try to make things as comfortable for them as possible so they are not afraid or overwhelmed. I love them unconditionally. My kids don't need your pity. They are amazing. They face challenges and fears every day. They are fun and silly and make me laugh and drive me crazy. Like any other kids. Whether or not they ever meet your definition of normal means NOTHING to me.Pay attention to your audience. Notice that when I talk of my kids to you, I smile and beam. I do not lower my head in shame. That light in my eyes is PRIDE. That is LOVE. I am not sorry. ""How do you deal with it?"" Don't we all deal with our own lives every day in the best way we know how? I just try to act from a place of love for my kids and hope my husband and I are making the best choices for them.Autism is not a disease or an illness. It is a neurological disorder. It's a different way of experiencing the world. Autistic brains work differently. It makes things more challenging in many ways. It also makes every single word, milestone, funny moment, new food tried, smile and interaction that much more amazing and worthwhile. You are truly missing out by writing off an entire group of individuals as sad, less than or worthy of pity.If you want to learn more about what is helpful or hurtful to say to parents of special needs children, click here.Here's the other thing:Everyone is deserving of love and respect, not pity and condescension. Ideally, everyone should be respectful and think before talking. However, when your job depends on other people's generosity, tread lightly. If you work in customer service or off tips, be extra careful what you say. I did tip the girl tonight but I will not be going back there. I don't always say the right thing but when in doubt, keep it short and sweet. Don't apologize to me. You are ignorant if hearing that my children have autism is that shocking and horrifying to you. So go get educated, just a little. I mean, that is, if you want repeat business. If 1 in 50 kids have autism (according to parental reports), chances are their parents, aunts, grandparents and loved ones are some of your customers. I don't need your sympathy. Not one ounce of it. My kids definitely do not need your sympathy or pity. Not sure what to say? Ask me to see pictures of my kids and comment on how cute they are. (because they really are).If you don't believe me, check them out. Do they look sorry to you?Also on HuffPost:via Autism Shines"

The one who hopefully, figured things out. The future me who I sensed was more happy and healthy. This was a pivotal turn and tool to help be reach a more joyful, happy life. Dear Future Me,I see you smiling, sitting so peacefully; you are simply in awe. You are looking at me, the younger, more naïve, more determined, more self-righteous self; you have nothing but love and gratitude for me. You watch me cry on my living room floor, completely bored and unmotivated by life. You see that I am depressed at how large my body has become; you see me struggle daily. You see the pain I carry around in my heart, and you watch me avoid mirrors because I hate what I see. You see my struggle, you see me have momentary outbursts and cry in fits of rage; and you see that I make it through. You see that I am okay. My pain, my struggles, my issues are not what define me. You see that I make it through this rough patch, and you know that I come out stronger, smarter and more self-aware than ever before. Future me, you are so elegant and poised; you have a sophisticated, yet laid back, manner that makes me want to get to know you much sooner. I see you smile with gratitude for all of the lessons I am in the middle of. The gut wrenching, painful moments of extreme self-hate, followed by harsh judgments and flurries of condescending words; you are proud to have them be a part of your past. You made it through and hold nothing but positive loving thoughts for yourself. You love yourself so much it shines through every pore of your body. Your energy is light and tender; I want to get to know you sooner. Future Me, you have a knowing way about you that is wise, patient and graceful. You see that everything is always in right order and that what I am going through right now is part of my bigger plan. It is as if you know that all of this turbulence and stress was divinely put into my life to help me become the person I need to be; the person that you ARE. Your eyes are soft and full of love for everything. I see that you have compassion that flows through your every movement. You have so much love to give the world, and you are shining with it.Future self, I see you, and I know that you are so proud of me for learning these lessons, for rolling up my sleeves and doing the work on myself that is required; for getting into the trenches of my own life to prepare me for my next chapter. You are oozing with awareness and you see that I am getting it. Day by day, I am learning. I choose to work towards you, and by taking responsibility for my life, I am able, one day, and hopefully soon, to be you. You smile because you see that I get it, that the choices I make today affect you and your daily life in the future. You see that I am showing up and doing the best I can. You see that what may feel like not enough, even a failure, for me is more than enough in your eyes. You are proud and honored to have been me. You have become everything you knew you could be because of what I am experiencing right now. This pain, this troubled heart, the burdens of my yesterdays are slowly being released. Day by day, I make a choice to show up and do the work on myself to be the person you have become. Future self, you show me what is possible. You shine love and self-respect in a manner that I can't grasp in this moment, though I am trying; you tell me that I am enough, and I see that somewhere between you and me, we have figured it out. I am so thankful that you take care of yourself every single day. You love yourself both inside and out, and you don't need anyone's approval. I am so honored to become you. Future self, the most powerful thing you are showing me is what is possible with our life. I can't wait to meet you. You have let go of worrying about any outcome; you know that everything always works out. You have forgiven all of your ex-lovers and fallen fully in love with yourself.  You are not defined by your problems, or any situation that you find yourself in. You ride the waves of life with such ease; it makes me want to catch up to you faster. Future self, I want to be where you are -- happy, healthy, and free of worries, in love with every part of our life. I see that together we figure it out. I know that my life is a moment-by-moment web of intricate experiences and reactions that help me shape you. I am working to make myself better for you, for us. I am showing up for all of my assignments. I am choosing to be happy. And I am choosing to love openly and honestly. Future self I am going to take big risks because I know that you know that I, that WE, need me to. I am not going to settle EVER AGAIN. I am going to leap into the unknown and completely follow my heart. I am going to become the person you know I can be. Future self, you are my guide and you show me what is possible for our life. You show me that no matter what life throws at us, we are stronger, smarter, healthier and more beautiful than ever, not because we rise above it, though we do, but because we have the courage to keep going. Our experiences make us who we are. I choose to let my dreams and my successes define me; I release my problems and the attachments that keep me identifying with them. I am no longer weighed down by self-loathing thoughts. I choose to be happy. Future self I love you, and I am so unbelievably proud I get to become you.

(Photo by Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dce2625000035003699ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Meeting Andrea Kremer was on my bucket list. She is one of four sports figures that made it to my bucket list (the other three being Al Michaels, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick). And meet Andrea Kremer I did, a few years ago, all because of a blog I wrote on being thankful for football on Thanksgiving. This week, I was lucky enough that work brought Andrea to DC, so we could meet, and chat about football (it's that time of year... her accurate prediction is that the Broncos will defeat my beloved Patriots), but also about fashion. Fashion on the football field, more specifically. Perhaps you are still wondering who Andrea Kremer is. She is one of the most accomplished and widely respected journalists in the industry today. In 2011, she was named one of the 10 greatest female sportscasters of all time. TV Guide said Kremer is ""among TV's best sports correspondents of either sex,"" and her work is ""distinguished by her eagerness to calmly ask tough questions and her refusal to pursue the same old story."" A two-time Emmy award winner, Kremer is currently the NFL Network's Chief Correspondent for Player Health and Safety. In her past life, and how I got to become a fan, she was a reporter for NBC sports. For five seasons, she was the sideline and feature reporter for the Emmy Award-winning Sunday Night Football on NBC. Andrea is very upfront about the importance of looks on TV: ""As much as it's fun to talk about football, TV is still a visual medium, and you have to look a certain way in terms of being a sportscaster."" She reminisces about her first network job in 1989, which was ESPN. Phil Jackson was hired as head coach of the Bulls. I was based in Chicago, and I go to the announcement of his hiring to interview him for Sports Center. It was 103 degrees in Chicago that day, and I had on a little red Ralph Lauren sleeveless dress. I have always had more muscular arms, but I am very petite. I remember busting by butt and getting the interview and putting this package together for Sports Center, and the feedback that I got was that ""my guns were blazing."" They didn't like that my arms were showing. And how about the work we just did -- hello?! Now, if you look at women in the studio, they are muscular, and constantly showing their arms. I believe that Michelle Obama had a lot to do with this. It is a lot more acceptable for any woman to dress that way today.Her favorite perk of the job? The clothing budget -- and getting to keep all the clothes! I have always been much more comfortable breaking down zone defense than picking clothes to be in front of the camera. And I was very spoiled by NBC. We had a very generous clothing budget, and even more importantly, I had access to Ariel Lawrence, my amazing professional stylist. I would go and meet her in NYC or wherever, she would pick everything out, they would come to my house, go to my closet, weed things out and style all of my outfits -- tops, pants, shoes, coats, accessories. She would photograph it and send it to the producer for approval. We always had to keep in mind that we could never wear the team colors... Stay away from blues and greens if the Giants and Eagles are playing!Other tips about dressing for TV? You never want to have anything that is distracting to the eye. No dangly earrings that are moving all around. You want people to focus on what you are saying -- and on nothing else. I remember one time my stylist picked out these two beautiful leather jackets. They were really expensive, they fit perfectly and they were gorgeous colors: ocean blue and deep violet; and they had lots of zippers. They were approved by the producers, so I wore one of them, with black pants. And my producer was like, 'Wow, look at that leather.' I got more tweets about that jacket from fans than anything I said on air. I mean, don't you have to pay attention to kickoff? I never wore it again -- I think it was too much about the distraction. People were staring at the jacket and not listening to what I was saying.And remember I was only seen from the waste up. So I wore boots exclusively when on the field. Never heels. I was on my feet for five to six hours, so comfortable shoes were always key, and cold feet make me angry.On hair and makeup: NBC has the best hair and makeup person. She travels every week around the country For HBO now we also have a phenomenal hair and makeup person. I love it -- but I am a content person. I don't want to worry about what I look like -- I worry about what I put on the air. I do understand however that what I look like is really important to the message.Did she ever have a wardrobe malfunction, I ask? ""No, thank goodness!""Does TV really add 10 pounds? ""For me, TV added height, not weight. Most people who meet me have no idea how petite I am. Except sometimes if I am standing next to a player."" (She is indeed tiny, at 5'2 and ¾, and probably weighs under 100 lbs. Funnily enough, seeing her stand next to the players, I always thought ""Wow, he is so big,"" and never ""Wow, she is so small,"" -- until I met her in person that is!)."

During a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" Q&A Tuesday, the former governor of California was asked to consider everything he's famous for and share with the Reddit community what he was ""most proud of"" and ""least proud of."" ""I'm most proud that I was smart enough to immigrate to the greatest country in the world where I could accomplish all of my dreams,"" the 66-year-old said of his 1968 move to the U.S. from Austria. ""I'm least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up,"" he added. Those mistakes undoubtedly include carrying out an extra-marital affair and fathering a child with the family's long-time housekeeper, Mildred Baena. Schwarzenegger admitted to the affair with Baena in May 2011, explaining in a statement that he had apologized to Shriver and his family and that he took ""full responsibility for the hurt"" he had caused them. Two months later, Shriver decided to end the couple's 25-year marriage and file for divorce. In an interview with Sean Hannity in October 2012, Schwarzenegger said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""ashamed"" about the affair and admitted he still held out hope of reconciling with Shriver, with whom he has four children. ""It was a situation where I couldn't even blame anybody else but myself, because my wife was a fantastic wife...my kids were fantastic. The thing that I cherished the most, you know, I destroyed by some stupid things that I've done,"" he said.  ""So now for me it's important to kind of rebuild again, get the trust back with the kids and with my wife and hopefully get back together again.""Schwarzenegger has yet to finalize his divorce from Shriver, but has reportedly moved on with physical therapist Heather Milligan.Click through the slideshow below for scenes from the pair's marriage: Keep in touch!
