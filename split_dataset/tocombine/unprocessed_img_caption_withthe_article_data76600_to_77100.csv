Here are ten easy recipes that don't require any hard-to-find ingredients or too much advance planning. And the best part about these stress-free suppers: even picky eaters will polish off their plates.1. Grilled Moroccan ChickenDon't be fooled by the exotic name of this dish; kids love it! I can't claim it's authentic, but the spices -- an aromatic blend of cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, ginger, paprika and coriander -- make it taste decidedly Moroccan. It only takes minutes to prepare, and there's barely any clean up. GET THE RECIPE2. Easy Slow-Baked BBQ Short RibsWhen you're craving comfort food, you can't beat meltingly tender short ribs slow-cooked in a sweet and tangy barbecue sauce. And here's the best part: only 15 minutes of prep work and the oven does the rest. Unlike many roast or stew recipes, it's not necessary to sear the meat first. You just slather it with sauce, put it in the oven, and let deliciousness ensue. GET THE RECIPE3. Chicken TacosThe whole family loves Taco Tuesday. You can feel good about whipping up these nutritious chicken and veggie tacos, and you won't miss the beef one bit. GET THE RECIPE4. Mirin Glazed SalmonThis recipe is adapted from one of my favorite cookbooks, Nigella Express by Nigella Lawson. It's an elegant and remarkably easy dish, one that completely belies the amount of effort on your part. Most of the ingredients are right out of the pantry, and you can have it on the table in 20 minutes. Honest! GET THE RECIPE5. Beef with BroccoliHere's an easy recipe for when you're craving Chinese food but don't want to go out. It's the quintessential Beef with Broccoli: tender strips of steak and crisp broccoli florets in a rich brown ginger and garlic sauce. You don't need a wok -- just a large skillet -- and the ingredients are all easy to find at your regular supermarket. GET THE RECIPE6. Parmesan Crusted ChickenThis family-pleaser will become part of your rotation. Kids love it -- I think mostly because it bears some resemblance to chicken fingers. GET THE RECIPE7. Easy Garlic Butter ShrimpThis is one of my go-to recipes when I have to hit the kitchen running. It takes just twenty minutes to make, I always have all of the ingredients on hand, the kids love it as much as I do, and there's barely any clean-up. Serve it over pasta or with a lightly toasted baguette for mopping up all of the garlic-butter sauce. GET THE RECIPE8. Cashew ChickenTender chunks of stir-fried chicken, crispy roasted cashews and bright green scallions in an authentic brown garlic sauce -- this one tastes just like take-out, only better.  GET THE RECIPE9. BBQ Turkey MeatloafComfort food doesn't have to be unhealthy. This BBQ turkey meatloaf is hearty, flavorful and -- bonus -- low in fat. GET THE RECIPE10. Spicy Chicken Thighs with Sweet & Tangy Honey GlazeThis dish is family-friendly (it's not too spicy) and incredibly easy to prepare. The chicken is first seasoned with garlic, chili powder, cumin and smoked paprika and then broiled with a sweet and tangy honey glaze. GET THE RECIPE"

4,FIFTY,What I Appreciate Most About My Oldest Friends,"Arlene Nisson Lassin, ContributorWriter, Blogger. Working on Two Books!",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-i-appreciate-about-my-oldest-friends_b_8204982.html,"Other than my wonderful family, my friends are my life's riches, and if I think about it, between my oldest friends, my adulthood friends, and my newer friends, I am rich beyond all measure.",2015-10-04,2015-09-28-1443399827-3350362-MeandjoybyBushrod16.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-28-1443399827-3350362-MeandjoybyBushrod16-thumb.JPG,"You know the saying, ""Make new friends, but keep the old, one is silver and the other's gold?"" Well, I am a gold collector, but not of the 14 or 18 karat variety.After I moved 1,600 miles from the place I grew up, I lost touch with just about everyone I grew up with, including some good friends. It was hard to manage long distance (expensive) phone calls or snail mail in the 1980's, so they just gradually faded from my world. I felt disconnected to my past in a way.The technology for communication available in the early 1980s and when I was growing up in the sixties and seventies was a telephone with busy signals and no answering machines, and note passing. If you haven't read my blog on this topic here, you are missing out. Thanks more recently to various reunions and social media, I am in touch again with so many who were important to me in my formative years. Having these friends again is like striking gold. There is a treasure trove of shared memories, secrets, exploits, shenanigans, and growing pains that no one else can share with you as these friends can do. Doesn't everyone become more sentimental as we age? People and memories are that much more special to us as we grow older.Compared to when I first moved away, it is so easy to keep in touch now; smart phones provide a place to message for a quick response, email is great, and sharing photos and memories on social media is fantastic as well. In fact, technology and social media have done wonders in restoring long lost friendships, and should be so credited.If you read some of my previous blogs, you know I just love reminiscing, (or reminisson -- a clever spin on my maiden name as someone termed it) about the ""old days."" I think it is so important to be able to revisit one's self before maturity set in, before one was fully formed. Though it exposes warts and all, and some of the memories are cringe-worthy, it is valuable for me to see how far I have come.In fact, I have diaries from my past, and the only problem with reviewing them to revisit my past is that the events are viewed solely from my own standpoint. They tell a story of my former self, and they paint a picture of a very different person than the one I am today. It's hard to believe who I was - so clueless about life, so immature, so emotional and emotionally needy, so hormonal. I so wish I could go back in time and guide and instruct that struggling young girl and make it a bit easier to grow up. Yet Joan Didion was so wise in her essay, ""On Keeping a Notebook.""She says: ""I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind's door at 4 a.m. of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends. We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were.""How beautifully, and correctly stated.Even better than reading my diaries is when I share events from the past with someone else who experienced it, because it brings in another perspective.I know there are others like me, who hold their friends from the past as something more precious than jewels.Some of my jewels live in far-flung places, and we keep in touch via emails, and an occasional phone call, and if they still live around where I grew up, an occasional visit. These visits are filled with emotion; hugs and tenderness, and laughter, and sometimes tears. We looked like Trouble with a capital T but we were good girls. My dear friend who goes all the way back to my last years in elementary school through high school knows my entire speckled history and loves me anyway. My wonderful two close high school friends, who helped shield me from mean girls, (I had a late puberty and was geeky) and who provided sass, acceptance, perspective on certain boys and loves, and even style and beauty tips, are the result of an early reunion that I am so grateful I attended. Every visit with them is so incredibly special, and they make me giggle in a way no one else can, evoking a feeling of carefree youth that only those freeing giggles can do.  I have a camp friend who I go way, way back with and who I am lucky enough to have living in the same city as me. We have such fun together talking about the old days, and even singing camp songs. Miraculously, we both still remember them. My high school boyfriend is someone I enjoy being in touch with because he believed in me before I believed in myself, and loved and accepted me unconditionally at a critical time. Keeping in touch with him provides an important link to my past.Friends from the late high school and college era are precious to me too, and I make sure they know that as I keep in touch with as many of them as possible.Even my friends of 30-plus years that I made after I moved away, who knew me as a naïve young married woman, and who evolved through parenting with me, are golden as well.Finally, since I am a people person, I love making new friends, and I continue to do so all the time. They are the other precious metal, the silver to all of the gold with which I try to surround myself. Other than my wonderful family, my friends are my life's riches, and if I think about it, between my oldest friends, my adulthood friends, and my newer friends, I am rich beyond all measure.Read my regular blog at www.arlenelassin.comEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

Her kidney was removed and she remains in intensive care.""The shooter asked what her religion was and she said, 'nothing,'"" said the young women's aunt, Colleen Fitzgerald, relaying her niece's account to reporters outside Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg, where the teen is being treated. Chris Harper-Mercer, the shooter, still fired on Fitzgerald, despite her not being a Christian.Fitzgerald's description is consistent with accounts from other witnesses, who also said the shooter asked the victims about their faith before shooting them. But it also adds doubt to claims that the shooter targeted Christians, as some witnesses have implied. Janet Willis, whose granddaughter Anastasia Boylan survived the attack, told The Associated Press on Saturday that Boylan recalled the shooter asking each person to state their religion. If they were Christian, Willis told the AP, Harper-Mercer would shoot them in the head. However, another survivor, Rand McGowan, told his mother, Stephanie Salas, that Harper-Mercer was not specifically targeting Christians.""'Do you have a God? Are you Christian? Do you have a religion?' It was more so saying, 'You're going to be meeting your maker. This won't hurt very long.' Then he would shoot them,"" Salas told the AP.Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, who also spoke to reporters on Saturday, did not provide information about the shooter's motive.Fitzgerald also said Harper-Mercer spared a male student and gave him an envelope to give to police, appearing to confirm Boylan's description of events to her family.""The shooter gave a student an envelope and said, 'You’re going to be the lucky one,'"" Fitzgerald's aunt told reporters.Bonnie Schaan, Fitzgerald's mother, said her daughter is slowly recovering. ""She’s starting to remember things and talk, but she is still jumpy when she hears a noise,"" Schaan said. ""Someone moving a chair will set her off.""Thursday was Fitzgerald's fourth day of college, where she was studying to become a nurse. Speaking through tears, Schaan said, ""I know my daughter's strong and she's gonna get through this."" She noted her daughter posted on Facebook sometime shortly after being shot, writing, ""The fucker shot me in the back.""Fitzgerald survived, her aunt said, by playing dead. Schaan was told that Cheyenne had a hand in saving her friend Boylan's life. ""That’s my daughter,"" Schaan said. ""That’s Cheyenne."" Schaan added that Fitzgerald and Boylan were together when the first shots rang out and helped one another. (Boylan's family has said that she, too, survived by playing dead.)""We are blessed that Cheyenne is here today,"" Schaan said.    ""I'm sorry for everyone in the community who don't have their children with them,"" she concluded.Fitzgerald is one of 9 injured survivors, including Boylan, McGowan and Chris Mintz, the army veteran who heroically charged Harper-Mercer. The shooting left 9 people dead.Harper-Mercer's family released a statement on Saturday as well, expressing their sorrow and regret for his actions. ""We are shocked and deeply saddened by the horrific events that unfolded on Thursday, October 1,"" the family said in a statement tweeted by local TV reporter Kim Eiten. ""Our thoughts, our hearts and our prayers go out to all of the families of those who died or are injured.""Hanlin revealed earlier on Saturday that the medical examiner had ruled Mercer-Harper's death a suicide. He reportedly took his own life during a firefight with law enforcement officers."
6,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Earns Backing Of Nation's Largest Union,Samantha Lachman and Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-nea-endorsement_us_56101a93e4b0af3706e10eb5,Some of the union members aren't that happy with the endorsement.,2015-10-03,The National Education Association announced it was endorsing Hillary Clinton for president on Saturday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56101b391800002e00dc1168.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The National Education Association, the nation’s largest union, endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Saturday. The union’s campaign arm had indicated that it was recommending the endorsement earlier this week, as Politico first reported. Members of the 3-million-strong union who support Clinton’s main rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), have already protested the move, just as Sanders supporters from the American Federation of Teachers did when Clinton secured that union's endorsement in July.""Clinton is a strong leader who will do what is best for America’s students. For more than four decades, Clinton has fought to make sure all children have a fair opportunity to succeed regardless of their ZIP code,"" said Lily Eskelsen García, president of the NEA, in a statement. ""Clinton will continue to advocate on behalf of students, educators and working families because she understands the road to a stronger U.S. economy starts in America’s public schools.”In an interview with The Huffington Post, García said that Clinton personally came and spoke to the organization's 175-person board of directors in a session that ""blew them away"" because of Clinton's understanding of what a president would have to do on certain education issues.“As a lifelong fighter for children and families, I am deeply honored to have earned the endorsement of the National Education Association and their nearly 3 million members,"" Clinton said in a statement after the endorsement was announced.The NEA’s campaign arm had said that it believed Clinton was the candidate best positioned to win in the general election next year. But both Clinton and Sanders had received “A” ratings on the group’s congressional legislative scorecard.Despite not earning the endorsement of the national union, Sanders issued a statement on Saturday thanking the members who did support him.“I am proud to have the support of many hundreds of thousands of members of the National Education Association and trade unionists all across America. We are going to win this nomination and the general election because of support from grassroots Americans. We are on track to do just that.”The NEA’s early endorsement of Clinton is out of step with its 2008 process, when it waited to endorse President Barack Obama until after he had secured his party’s nomination. Sanders supporters within the ranks of other unions that have endorsed Clinton have expressed frustration and anger that their respective unions decided to endorse in the primary at all.García said that the decision not to get involved in the 2008 primary was a factor in the union's decision to back a candidate in the primary race this time around.""People did talk about that. Were we there to impact the debate? Were we there to influence the candidates?"" she asked. ""I think what won the day on when [is that] people said, 'You know, if you don't get in when it counts, it doesn't count when you get in.'""But some of the NEA’s state chapters hadn’t waited until the national body made its decision. The Vermont NEA endorsed Sanders, while the New Hampshire chapter picked Clinton in September. Other chapters had urged the national board to wait longer before making an endorsement.But the NEA chose Clinton, García said, because she was the candidate who the union felt would be best able to highlight education issues in the presidential race.""It was never a discussion about who's for education who's against education. People are gonna make up their own minds we get that, we understand that, we respect that,"" she said. The NEA’s interests include ending competitive block grant programs supported by Obama like “Race to the Top,” and scaling back federally mandated “high-stakes” standardized testing that influences administrative decisions about teachers. Members of the Democratic Party have been divided over the merits of changes in public education, including more funding for charter schools and teacher evaluation systems influenced by standardized test scores.“It’s just dead wrong to make teachers the scapegoats for all of society’s problems,” Clinton told the AFT earlier this year, according to The Washington Post. “Where I come from, teachers are the solution. And I strongly believe that unions are part of the solution, too.”While Clinton has been careful to avoid antagonizing either the school choice camp or the teachers unions, she has frequently called out Republican attacks against collective bargaining and organizing on the campaign trail. She’s also delighted unions by coming out against the Affordable Care Act’s impending tax on high-cost insurance plans. Unions are campaigning to have the tax repealed because they fear it will shift more out-of-pocket costs to their members.Clinton has secured more union endorsements than Sanders. But her campaign experienced a setback this week when the International Association of Fire Fighters abandoned its earlier plan to endorse her. And two other major unions -- the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees -- have indicated that they will take more time to consult their members about an endorsement in the primary. This story has been updated to include comment from Lily Eskelsen García.Also on HuffPost:"
7,POLITICS,Democrats To Target Gun Loophole With New Bill,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-target-gun-loophole_us_560ff0a6e4b076812702423b,The law would end the loophole that allowed the Charleston shooter to purchase a gun despite a drug arrest.,2015-10-03,"Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) is co-sponsoring legislation to close the ""default to proceed"" gun background check loophole.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560ff34c1800002d00dc1161.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic senators from Connecticut announced Friday that they are introducing a bill to close a loophole that allows people who have not completed background checks to buy guns. Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) are sponsoring legislation that would ban the “default to proceed” loophole, which allows gun dealers to sell guns to people if the FBI does not notify them that the sale is against the law within 72 hours. Some states already ban such sales, but many other states do not, and federal law doesn't require it. There is no evidence thus far that the gunman who perpetrated the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, on Thursday benefitted from this loophole. But Dylann Roof purchased one of the guns he used in the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre through “default to proceed,” Blumenthal noted in an interview on CNN Saturday with Michael Smerconish. The FBI did not complete a background check for Roof in time because of a clerical error that concealed his arrest for drug possession in February. “The point is not only that specific instances would have been prevented, but simply that America can be made safer by keeping this wash of weapons out of the hands of dangerous people,” Blumenthal said. In 2012, ""default to proceed"" sales allowed 3,722 people with criminal records or mental health issues who would otherwise be barred from buying guns to purchase them, and allowed 2,500 to do so in 2014, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.Walmart, the nation's largest gun seller, does not allow ""default to proceed"" gun sales. Blumenthal, Murphy and 11 other senators called on other top dealers like Cabela's, EZ Pawn and Bass Pro Shop to do the same in August, but they have refused to change their policies.These businesses' refusal to end default sales voluntarily is part of what motivated the lawmakers to propose banning the practice nationwide, Blumenthal said on Saturday.Connecticut, Blumenthal’s home state and the site of the infamous massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, is one of the states that bans “default to proceed” gun sales.He argued, however, that other states' looser gun laws endanger the residents of states with stricter regulations because weapons can easily move from state to state.“The weakest link in the system among the states can populate the rest of the country with guns,"" he said, ""because our boundaries and borders are so porous that illegal trafficking means that guns can spread across the country, can come to New York or Connecticut, [which have] tough gun laws, through the means of transport from the Southern states, where there are relatively weak laws.""Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) introduced a similar bill in the House in July in response to the Charleston shooting, but it remains in committee and is unlikely to advance. Other lawmakers have introduced a variety of gun safety bills.Federal law does not require background checks for private unlicensed gun sales, such as those at gun shows, enabling convicted felons and others ineligible to buy guns to purchase them in states that have not subjected these sales to background checks individually. Blumenthal also said he supports mandating background checks for unlicensed sales nationwide.Blumenthal and Murphy's bill faces an uphill battle, since Republicans control both houses of Congress and almost uniformly oppose new gun safety legislation.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that while background checks for unlicensed gun sales are not mandated by federal law, some states do require them.

But the actor had also included a provision in his will on behalf of Schneider, whom he married in Oct. 2011.Schneider claimed she was not receiving enough money to maintain the six-bedroom Tiburon, California, home where she lived with her husband before his death. Meanwhile, Williams' children claimed their stepmother was ""adding insult to a terrible injury"" by trying to change the terms of their father's trust. While exact terms of the agreement were not disclosed, lawyers stated Schneider will receive enough support to continue living in the home during her lifetime. Zachary, Zelda and Cody Williams, however, will eventually inherit the property.""While it's hard to speak of this as a win, given it stems from the greatest loss of all, I am deeply grateful to the judge for helping resolve these issues,"" Schneider said in a statement obtained by People. The actor's widow was also able to keep ""the few emotional items she requested,"" including wedding gifts, select clothing and a favorite watch.Williams' children will receive the majority of their father's personal possessions, including his Academy Award, six Golden Globes, two Emmys and five Grammy awards, according to the Los Angeles Times. ""The children are relieved to have this behind them,"" a lawyer for the Williams children told The Associated Press.   Also on HuffPost:"

The justices responded on Friday.,2015-10-03,"Anti-death penalty activists rally outside the Supreme Court on Sept. 29, 2015, in a final attempt to prevent the execution of Oklahoma inmate Richard Glossip in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560faeab1400002800bfc084.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court on Friday issued a posthumous response to Alfredo Prieto, a serial killer on Virginia's death row whose lawyers had petitioned the court several times to put his execution on hold.In the short, unsigned order, the justices dismissed Prieto's request ""as moot"" -- meaning neither a grant nor a denial of a stay of execution would have helped him. Prieto was executed Thursday night.On Wednesday, the court had denied two other petitions from Prieto's attorneys, who were hoping legal challenges over Virginia's drug protocol would sway the justices to temporarily delay their client's execution. BuzzFeed News has a comprehensive report on all the legal maneuverings in the Prieto case.Unrelated to his execution, Prieto also had a pending case before the Supreme Court over Virginia's use of solitary confinement. Though that case is also technically moot, New York Times reporter Adam Liptak noted on Friday that another Virginia death-row inmate, Mark Eric Lawlor, moved to intervene in the case to keep it alive. The justices could decide what to do with the case by Oct. 9.The court's Friday action in the Prieto case marked a busy week for the justices' death penalty docket and capital punishment overall.The Supreme Court had also been asked to intervene at the eleventh hour in the cases of Richard Glossip out of Oklahoma and Kelly Gissendaner out of Georgia, but halted neither execution.Gissendaner was executed on Wednesday shortly after midnight, but Glossip was given a last-minute reprieve by Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R), amid concerns over the drugs the state had on hand for the execution.And it looks like the Supreme Court won't need to act in another execution originally scheduled for next week. On Friday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) commuted the death sentence of Kimber Edwards, following a newspaper report that cast serious doubts about the man's murder conviction.The next time the court will consider issues relating to the death penalty is Oct. 7, when the justices hear oral arguments in a pair of cases out of Kansas involving jury instructions in capital sentencing."

Now, the Obama administration is facing growing pressure to support strong encryption in the United States, with a broad coalition of civil liberties and privacy advocates petitioning the White House to make a strong public statement in favor of improved security to protect personal information, mobile devices and business secrets from hacking or loss. In a recent episode of HuffPost Live, advocates discussed the issues and points of contention.HuffPost spoke with Chertoff, who now runs a risk management and security consulting firm, this September. The following interview, which touches on technology, spying, privacy and legislative reforms, has been edited for length and clarity.We've seen huge data breaches in the private sector, but the hack of the Office of Personnel Management looks like the most serious breach of confidential data I can recall. What fallout are you seeing from it? As to the OPM breach, I agree with you. A number of commentators think that this is less about criminality and more about trying to do, essentially, a database of American citizens, which should be useful for intelligence purposes. That is a huge step forward, in terms of the kind of espionage that they do traditionally.Beyond that, there’s an emerging ability to corrupt or destroy data, or interfere with the operation of control systems which goes far beyond getting your personal information erased. It is actually potentially disruptive for physical objects or the death of human beings. I think it is a much broader problem than just the data breach privacy discussion that we’ve been having. As we multiply the number of devices that are connected, often without much consideration of security, I think it’s only going to become a bigger and bigger issue.Is there a proportionate response to this kind of espionage, in terms of China? Do you support enacting economic sanctions for such actions?First of all, separate the two types of espionage. I’m very traditional in taking the view that commercial espionage by government is inappropriate. I think the administration talked about some kind of sanctions for companies that benefit from intellectual property, and that’s an unusual approach.It gets trickier when you get to national security espionage. You protest against it. If you find someone who does it, it’s appropriate to prosecute them. Frankly, that really worked in the Cold War. The Russians did it to our spies, too. It’s a little hard to get worked up into a moral outrage, because what the Chinese have done with respect to OPM, at least in my view, is a variation on a traditional theme of gathering intelligence, but they’ve been able to scale it up.Our biggest response has got to be to protect our assets. I think the most serious disappointment in the OPM breach is it appears people didn’t even take the steps that they were told to take to reach a minimum level of security. They utterly missed the fact that they were holding very valuable information. They viewed themselves as if they were like a great big HR department.We need to have a bigger understanding of the value of data, so that people understand that it’s not just credit cards that matter. There’s all kinds of information that can be useful to an adversary or competitor that needs to be protected. What steps should average businesses and citizens take, with respect to protecting their own information? What tools should we have available to us? Obviously, encryption of data in motion and data at rest is a very useful tool. Not everything needs to be connected to everything else. How do you handle administrative privileges? Who gets to set conditions of access and things of that sort? How do you internally monitor the perimeters or anomalous behavior, or something that’s happened that’s inexplicable?Use a number of different techniques. You’re not totally eliminating the risk, but you’re reducing the risk and you’re managing it. That mitigates a lot of that potential damage from these kinds of attacks.Risk is an important word, in this context. The FBI and the Justice Department are asking citizens to accept the idea that we should put ourselves at more risk through weakening encryption so that they can access our mobile devices if they have a warrant. What’s your position? I think even with [strong] encryption, there would be plenty of other ways that law enforcement and judges can use to protect us. That’s always been the case traditionally. In the old days, back when I was doing cases as a prosecutor, they didn't talk very much. We were still able to make cases using other techniques.I understand what the motivation of the FBI and the law enforcement people is, but I think it’s misguided for a number of reasons. To believe that if you have a law to require a duplicate key or a key escrow, that bad people wouldn’t find another way to make their messages disappear, even if they had to go to technologies and providers from other parts of the world? Frankly, that’s the world we’ve always lived in.Would bills like the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 or the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, both designed to promote voluntary information sharing between the private sector and government, help with these kinds of issues? There are a couple areas where I think legislation would be useful. One, I think it would be promoting information [sharing] by creating liability protection for people who share information in an appropriate way both with the government and also among themselves, making sure that what they share is confidential so that they don’t feel constrained about giving information about attacks. Updating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act will eliminate an anomaly between how we treat interception of email that’s current versus stored email, which is a distinction that maybe made sense when the statute was passed many years ago, but has lost its logic. That would go some way in promoting a greater sense of reassurance about privacy, and that’s certainly an important part of the discussion.The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act also poses issues for the security research community. People are concerned, with some justification, that if they do research on government or commercial websites, they could be held liable or even prosecuted. Should there be any reform of the law, in your view?I’m not aware anybody has been prosecuted for doing research, so I don’t know how much of a problem that is. I think, in general, with newer technology, statutes that are 10 years or 20 years old often make no sense, simply because they were drafted at a time when the architecture was radically different from what we have today. These things ought to have an expiration date. What frustrates you about what Congress and the press say about technology and security? To me, the most frustrating thing is when people treat privacy and security as if they are trade-offs. I think you can’t have privacy without security. If by privacy we mean, ""you give me your information, and I’m gonna make sure it’s treated in a proper way,"" that promise is meaningless if I can’t enforce it. If somebody can hack into my data, it doesn’t matter what I promised you. It’s going out the door anyway.At the same time, without privacy, we can’t be secure. Security is to be able to keep data, to keep control of data that you’ve generated that is relevant to you.I would like to see less of an oppositional approach and more taking a view that these things are actually interdependent and mutually reinforcing."

The storm's movement was expected to gradually pick up speed in the next 48 hours.The U.S. Coast Guard said search and rescue crews were hunting for the 735-foot (224 m) El Faro and its 33 crew members after it was overcome by heavy weather from Joaquin off Crooked Island in the Bahamas on Thursday morning.The ship, with 28 U.S. citizens and five Polish nationals aboard, was headed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Jacksonville, Florida, when it reported it had lost propulsion and was listing and taking on water, the Coast Guard said.The Coast Guard said there had been no further communications after the vessel issued the emergency call at about 7:30 a.m. Thursday.The El Faro was in the eye of Joaquin about 35 miles (56 km)north of Crooked Island when it issued the distress call, according to Chief Ryan Doss with the Coast Guard in Miami.""We have had 20-foot seas reported so it's going to take a while to get into the area,"" Doss said.A Coast Guard cutter headed to help after taking part in a separate rescue mission off Haiti, while two Air Force Hurricane Hunter planes searched in vain for the U.S.-owned El Faro.""The low cloud cover makes satellite communications difficult,"" Doss said, while the winds and high seas made it hard to get close enough by sea or air.""The storm is so bad and slow moving it's hard for our planes to get low enough to inspect the surface of the water.""Mike Hanson, a spokesman for the owner of the ship, Tote Maritime Puerto Rico, told Reuters all contact with the vessel had been lost since Thursday morning, which he said was “very unusual,” especially as the ship was equipped with a marine transponder, a satellite phone and GPS locators on the containers. “We checked them all,” he said.The El Faro, built in 1975, recently underwent a complete updating, Hanson said.Captain Stephen Russell, director of the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency, said earlier there were no reports of deaths or injuries in the Bahamas from Joaquin.He cited reports of extensive flooding and structural damage on at least two smaller islands in the archipelago, but apart from some roofs ripped off houses, damage seemed to be limited.The storm dumped torrential rain over parts of the Bahamas but its hurricane-force winds missed the larger islands and the main cities and cruise ship ports of Freeport and Nassau.An easterly shift in the forecast track of the slow-moving system meant it was expected to pass well off the U.S. eastern seaboard, according to the NHC.But accumulated rainfall in the Carolinas from unrelated storms this week coupled with more on the way from Joaquin prompted a warning from the National Weather Service on Friday about a “historic, potentially life-threatening rainfall event” in parts of the Carolinas and northeast Georgia this weekend.Up to 12 inches (30.5 cm) of rain were expected in some areas between Friday and Sunday, with flash floods and gusts up to 35 miles per hour (56 kph) likely to topple trees and cause power outages, the Weather Service said. Flood warnings and coastal flood advisories were in effect for some sections.“Our state is now likely to miss any direct impact from the hurricane, but there’s still significant danger of flooding, high seas, heavy surf, beach erosion and overwash,” North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory told a news conference on Friday.Two deaths in the Carolinas on Thursday were linked to heavy rainfall.Earlier this week, the governors of New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Maryland declared states of emergency and announced measures including mobilization of National Guard troops in preparation for the storm.Before the first easterly shift in Joaquin’s trajectory, New York and New Jersey - where Superstorm Sandy killed more than 120 people and caused $70 billion of property damage in October 2012 - both faced potential threats from the storm."

But it regained Category 4 status on Saturday, with hurricane force winds extending up to 70 miles (110 km) from its center.The U.S. Coast Guard said there was still no trace on Saturday of El Faro, a 735-foot (224-m) cargo ship that vanished off Crooked Island in the Bahamas on Thursday morning after it was overcome by heavy weather from Joaquin.The vessel, with 28 U.S. citizens and five Polish nationals aboard, was headed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Jacksonville, Florida when it reported losing propulsion and that it was listing and taking on water, the Coast Guard said.It said there had been no further communications after a distress call received at about 7:30 am (0730 ET) Thursday.While Joaquin has continued to shift away from the U.S. East Coast, dangerous flooding triggered by heavy rainfall was expected across much of the Carolinas and parts of Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey this weekend, U.S. forecasters said.

But it regained Category 4 status on Saturday, with hurricane force winds extending up to 70 miles (110 km) from its center.The U.S. Coast Guard said there was still no trace on Saturday of El Faro, a 735-foot (224-m) cargo ship that vanished off Crooked Island in the Bahamas on Thursday morning after it was overcome by heavy weather from Joaquin.The vessel, with 28 U.S. citizens and five Polish nationals aboard, was headed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Jacksonville, Florida when it reported losing propulsion and that it was listing and taking on water, the Coast Guard said.It said there had been no further communications after a distress call received at about 7:30 am (0730 ET) Thursday.While Joaquin has continued to shift away from the U.S. East Coast, dangerous flooding triggered by heavy rainfall was expected across much of the Carolinas and parts of Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey this weekend, U.S. forecasters said.

15,POLITICS,U.S. Dodges Responsibility For Saudi Airstrikes That Kill Yemeni Civilians,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yemen-civilian-deaths-saudi-airstrikes_us_5610566be4b0dd85030c53a9,"At the same time, the U.S. provides Saudi Arabia with targeting assistance and bombs.",2015-10-03,"A Saudi-led airstrike that hit a wedding party in Yemen's central Taiz province killed at least 131 people, making it the deadliest single incident since the start of the country's civil war, medical officials said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is moving to distance itself from the mounting civilian casualties in Yemen’s civil war, while simultaneously providing targeting assistance to a Saudi Arabian-led coalition that has been conducting airstrikes over Yemen for the past six months. United Nations officials say the coalition is responsible for the majority of the country's civilian deaths, which recently surpassed 2,300.Last Saturday, airstrikes targeting Taiz, a city about 170 miles south of the capital, killed over 130 people attending a wedding. Yemen’s International Red Crescent Society reported that two of its volunteers, Qaed Faisal, 28, and Omar Fareh, 31, were killed by the shelling in a neighboring area on the same day.Riyadh’s bombing campaign began in March, as Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi fled the country under assault from a Shiite Houthi insurgency. The U.S., eager to prevent the impoverished country from falling under control of al Qaeda fighters there, has backed the Saudi Arabian effort to restore Hadi’s rule.But human rights groups accused the Saudi coalition of conducting indiscriminate airstrikes and unnecessarily endangering the civilian population. The International Red Crescent Society has already lost eight staff members and volunteers from the shelling.White House officials said they were “shocked and saddened” by last week’s wave of civilian deaths, but said they were not responsible. “The United States has no role in targeting decisions made by the Coalition in Yemen,” said White House spokesman Ned Price in a statement on Friday night. “Nevertheless, we have consistently reinforced to members of the Coalition the imperative of precise targeting,” he added.Friday’s statement seemed to contradict earlier news reports, where U.S. Central Command officials said they provide “targeting assistance” to the Saudi-led coalition. When asked about the discrepancy, a senior administration official told The Huffington Post, ""There is a clear distinction between logistical and intelligence support, which we have provided, and taking part in targeting decisions, which we do not do.” The official noted that the support the U.S. provides to the coalition is intended to increase accuracy of airstrikes conducted by its allies and minimize civilian deaths.A recent Congressional Research Service report said the U.S. sold $90 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2014, including fighter aircraft, helicopters, missile defense systems, missiles, bombs and armored vehicles. The report noted that the U.S. has supplied the Saudis with American-made weaponry for its military intervention in Yemen and has shared intelligence to support Riyadh’s targeting decisions.The White House’s effort to distance itself from the most recent round of civilian deaths in Yemen comes two days after Saudi Arabia successfully resisted a Dutch effort at the U.N. Human Rights Council -- a body now led by Riyadh -- to send an independent human rights team into Yemen to investigate human rights violations committed by all parties during the civil war.Instead, the Saudis offered a resolution that puts the U.N. in a supporting role in an inquiry headed by Hadi, the exiled Yemeni president -- who is a party to the conflict.While the U.S. supported the initial Dutch resolution, they made no public effort to block the Saudi government from killing the independent investigation. Keith Harper, the U.S. representative to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, told The Associated Press that while he supported the Dutch initiative, he preferred a consensus outcome, meaning one that had the backing of Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia was named head of a panel on the Human Rights Council last month, prompting observers to question the propriety of giving the country such a position while its government commits flagrant human rights abuses, both in its military intervention in Yemen and by beheading activists at home. When asked if the U.S. was troubled by the move, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters, “We would welcome it. We’re close allies.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that Saudi Arabia leads the U.N.'s Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia's ambassador was elected, rather, to an influential panel within the council, according to the Independent."

This is your punishment. You are going to stand here and take it.""""Ludwigsen then began to lick [her] ear,"" the suit stated, according to the Post.Todd Krouner, the attorney for the players, told The Huffington Post that the case ""has strong merit to it.""""The allegations of sexual discrimination, harassment and deprivation of the student athletes' academic and social activities at Nyack College are profound and pervasive,"" Krouner said.According to the Journal News, the three sexual harassment complaints also name Nyack College and administrators for failing to conduct sufficient background checks on the coach and for sexual discrimination and negligence. Ludwigsen had been investigated, though not arrested, for alleged sexual harassment of teen girls he had coached in California.

The waves travel along the flume and crash onto whatever researchers have built at the other end—which could include a novel type of dike, an artificial sand dune or gravel beach, or a pylon used to hold up an offshore wind turbine.So far, the machine has topped out at an 18-foot wave, but researchers hope to go higher.The machine cost approximately $30 million to construct, and can contain up to 2,400,000 gallons of water, the BBC reports.Researchers say they will test ""wave heights, wave pressures and forces, flow velocities, wave overtopping, damage patterns and changes in cross-sections.""

23,POLITICS,Why Afghanistan Is Going To Fall To The Taliban Again. And It's Not Why You Think.,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarah-chayes-kunduz_us_56103348e4b0768127024d1b,"""I'm afraid I don't see how the U.S. can helpfully respond in Afghanistan, at this point.""",2015-10-03,"Doctors Without Borders staff huddle together after a U.S. airstrike on a hospital in Kunduz, Afhanistan on Oct. 3, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5610444d1800002d00dc116f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, the Taliban began the process of retaking Afghanistan, starting with the northern city of Kunduz. The U.S. and Afghan governments have since been battling to recapture it -- a fight that included the U.S. bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital that killed at least 12 medical staff, along with at least seven patients, on Saturday.The Taliban has since charged that Afghan intelligence purposely gave the U.S. the hospital's coordinates. Even the possibility that such an accusation is true -- and the duration of the sustained attack suggests that something unusual happened -- points toward the reason that Afghanistan is headed back toward Taliban control: The government is thoroughly corrupt, and the U.S. has been unwilling to take measures to address the situation. While a handful of civilian and military leaders identified corruption as an existential threat to the country, the problem remains unsolved. After covering the invasion of Afghanistan, former NPR journalist Sarah Chayes decided to stay in the country to try to help turn it around. She opened a business in Kandahar and probably spent more time living directly with the Afghan people -- without security guards -- than any other American since 2001. Chayes ultimately went to work for coalition forces in the region, sharing the fundamental insight she'd gained: Corruption was eroding public support of the government. She won audiences with all the right people, and even made some converts, but ultimately, her counsel wasn't taken by the U.S. government as a whole.Chayes turned her experience into the groundbreaking book Thieves of State, which forecasts that corrupt governments will continue to be the targets of insurgents who win public support. Like the Iraqi army did in Mosul and elsewhere a year earlier, the Afghan army and police in Kunduz simply melted away.Support -- or, at least, a lack of opposition -- from the local population has been key to the Taliban's success. Over a period of a few years, the Taliban gradually crept closer to Kunduz and ultimately embedded its militants in the suburbs. Then, in less than a day, they took over the city.Reporting from the region makes it clear that the Afghan government lost the population as a result of its corruption. The way it erodes public support is intuitive: Imagine that you are an Afghan civilian generally opposed to the extremism of the Taliban. Yet for nearly everything you need to do -- travel to and from work, transport merchandise, enroll in school, open a business -- you get shaken down, often by somebody of a different ethnicity. The Taliban, with all its piety, at least might not be corrupt, you start to think. As The New York Times reported last week:Over the past few years, faith in the government and the warlords who were allied with the government, never strong, has rapidly diminished. Militias and Afghan Local Police forces installed by the American Special Forces were largely unaccountable. They extorted protection money from farmers, and committed rapes and robberies. But because they had guns and the backing of local strongmen close to the government, people’s complaints were ignored.Chayes has since moved back to the U.S. to work as a senior associate in the Democracy and Rule of Law Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. I asked her a few questions about Kunduz and the future of Afghanistan, and she noted that this isn't the first time the coalition has accidentally slaughtered civilians in Kunduz, with devastating political repercussions.What do you see as the connection between corruption and the fall of Kunduz and the surrounding area?Like the Islamic State's capture of large parts of Iraq, the Taliban successes in and around Kunduz are the almost inevitable consequence of corrupt and abusive governance. This is not a recent phenomenon. Back in the spring of 2009, when I first looked closely at Kunduz, the governor was famous for his land grabs. In an arid place like Afghanistan, almost entirely dependent on high-end agriculture, fruit growing and such, land is incredibly precious. Stealing someone's land is worse than murdering them. The German military had responsibility for the province, and the intelligence chief's assessment was ""everyone around him is corrupt."" That was six and a half years ago, and nothing changed in the interim. Years of built-up grievances and no avenue of recourse drive people to extremes. We've been seeing that in the U.S. lately; we shouldn't be surprised to see it -- even if in different forms -- in Afghanistan.And not only has corruption in Kunduz been causing indignation, which prompts some to join the Taliban, or at least to choose not to interfere with their activities, but there has been evidence over the years of collusion between government officials and the Taliban, selling them munitions and supplies, corrupt judges letting them out of jail and so on. President [Mohammad] Ashraf Ghani's more recent efforts to fix local administration may have been too abrupt, and too focused on hard security -- not enough on legitimate grievances and community consensus-building -- to repair the damage.Could the Taliban have returned without government corruption?I don't think so. There is nothing magical about the Taliban. They're Afghans, like the population of Kunduz. If that population was proud of its government, they could keep the Taliban out.But there are four aggravating factors that have made matters worse:1. The Afghan Local Police initiative. This was (likely) a brainchild of then-Gen. David Petraeus, modeled on Iraq. The idea, first launched in Afghanistan in 2009, and in Kunduz a couple of years later, was to briefly train and stand up local militias to fight the Taliban. The notion was that U.S. special forces would be working with them, they would be supervised by local elders and unlikely to commit depredations against their neighbors.I was against this initiative from the start, and argued hard against it when I worked for the commander of the international troops (the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF). I didn't see how the solution to poorly trained and disciplined police and armed forces was even less well-trained and disciplined local militias. And sure enough, ALP units quickly became the scourge of their neighbors, shaking people down, committing human rights abuses, and so on. They were loyal to local strongmen, not village elders, and created just the kind of chaotic and violent environment that had led to the rise of the Taliban in the first place in 1994. The existence of formal ALP, moreover, became the pretext for every local warlord to stand up his own personal militia, calling it ALP.2. Ethnic divisions. Such a situation was particularly problematic in Kunduz, because, [as] a kind of microcosm of Afghanistan as a whole, Kunduz province is deeply divided along ethnic lines. That means that any corruption the governor might perpetrate is doubly painful to victims who are members of the other ethnic group, since they see the slight as one to their whole community. Similarly with the ALP: Those units tended to be manned by non-Pashtuns. And the Taliban are largely Pashtun. So, local Pashtuns started seeing the Taliban as their only defenders against the abuses of these militias. In research we at Carnegie have been doing in other countries, we've identified deep ethnic rifts as an additional risk factor that, combined with corruption, makes security crises more likely. Syria, Iraq and Ukraine corroborate the hypothesis.3. National-level chaos. The U.S., in its wisdom, decided that the solution to a completely botched election last year -- in which both leading candidates forged thousands of votes -- was to force them to govern together in a two-headed ""national unity"" government, which is anything but national or unified. Now Afghanistan has a president and a ""chief executive,"" an office that does not exist in the Afghan Constitution that the U.S. helped write and swears by. The result has been complete paralysis. A year after the election, there is still no defense minister. Can you imagine an army functioning properly with an ""acting"" in charge of the ministry? 4. History of Taliban implantation. It's not as if the Taliban picked Kunduz out of a hat. It was their last bastion in the north in 2001. Hundreds of Pakistani soldiers were among the Taliban taken prisoner there, and were allowed to fly back to Pakistan.If the status quo prevails, will the Taliban takeover continue?I don't see why it wouldn't. There's a pattern that I wouldn't be surprised to see repeated. In the south, where I lived, what would often happen is a dramatic Taliban offensive, capture of a key site, followed by a government/ISAF recapture. But when you looked closely, you found that the Taliban had in fact executed a ""strategic withdrawal."" That is, they had faded away in the face of the counter-attack. This would usually happen in the summer or fall. Then, during the winter, they'd filter back into the area, start intimidating and assassinating people, and work their way back in. So, by the next year, they actually controlled all the territory they had gained briefly in that initial attack, but had regained it almost invisibly. The first dramatic military assault was really aimed at sending a message to the local population. It was psychological warfare. Could this have been predicted and prevented?I just looked at my notes from that first trip I took to Kunduz with the ISAF command group -- when Kunduz was emerging as a serious security problem. It was on May 17, 2009.But the U.S. government made a decision -- finalized in 2011 -- not to prioritize governance issues in its handling of Afghanistan. Also not to call the government of Pakistan on its active support for Taliban and Haqqani insurgents. Once those two decisions were made, it was impossible to prevent the current capture of Kunduz. But if either of those decisions had gone the other way, I think this was eminently preventable.How can the U.S. respond?This context means the almost exclusive focus of U.S. debate on whether or not more U.S. troops should have been left in Afghanistan -- or in Iraq, for that matter -- is almost entirely beside the point. Of course, overwhelming numbers of U.S. troops could curb extremist advances. But without addressing the underlying governance issues, such a pause would only last as long as the U.S. troops were present. So what's the answer ... keep U.S. troops in these countries forever?On the other hand, as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I think the window of opportunity to exert real leverage on governance and corruption is closed. So, I'm afraid I don't see how the U.S. can helpfully respond in Afghanistan, at this point. We had more than a decade, and we squandered a remarkable moment in history. "

""It makes for an easy one-liner to be like, 'So the big bad record label wanted you to write love songs and this is you fighting back.' It’s not that it’s not true, but it wasn’t that simple.""So what's the real story?Image: Degrassi WikiaBareilles opens up about the truth behind ""Love Song"" in her new book, Sounds Like Me , which will be available in bookstores on Tuesday. For starters, the singer says the record company never actually told her to write a love song. ""No, nobody ever said that,"" Bareilles tells HuffPost.In fact, a lot of the inspiration for writing ""Love Song"" actually came from terrible co-writing sessions the record label, Epic, and Sony wanted her to do, she says. ""The co-writing sessions, I think for me, they came at a time where I was still so unsure of my own edges. In a way, I was still sort of discovering who I was as an artist at that time. And while I don’t think that any of those collaborators had any bad intentions, I just don’t think I was ready to collaborate,"" says the singer.Bareilles explains she wasn't able to be ""authentic"" in the co-writing sessions, but she now views them as a ""great learning moment."" She adds, ""I gave myself a lot of heartache over it, but really, at the end of the day, if you want anything to be different, you can just ask for that.""Bareilles also explains that, despite its lyrics, ""Love Song"" actually is a love song.""It was a love song to my craft. It was a love song to my intention, to my heart and soul. I was fighting for the essence of some truth inside of me, which to me is a beautiful love song. It just wasn’t a duet between Peter Cetera and Amy Grant,"" she says, laughing. ""It wasn’t going to be the end title in a romantic comedy, at all.""So there you have it. Though no one actually asked her to write a love song, you can be pretty sure everyone has since.In a Reddit AMA, Bareilles was asked what it would take for her to write a love song, to which she responded, ""Oh boy. This question.""She went on to write, ""I have to think I love you. In some way. Some love needs expression and then the song appears. That's how."" Over the last few years, when she hasn't been writing books or fielding questions about her old songs, Bareilles has been busy writing the music for the upcoming Broadway musical ""Waitress."" She's also releasing a new album inspired by it, ""What's Inside: Songs from Waitress,"" which the singer jokingly calls ""completely self-indulgent,"" adding she hopes it gives fans ""a little glimpse"" into the kind of music she's been making for the last couple of years.

I was beyond nervous. What if Dan saw this island and shrugged his shoulders? What if he couldn't understand the magic I felt every time I went there?I decided to play it safe. For starters, I got a sitter for our four young children and took Dan to Prince Edward Island for a long, romantic weekend alone in the Great George Hotel in Charlottetown. I'm a diner gal, but Dan is a foodie; I hoped to find meals that would satisfy his culinary quests.I also avoided the ceilidhs. Children who grow up in the Canadian Maritimes pick up fiddles as soon as they can walk, which means Prince Edward Island produces world-renowned fiddlers like Richard Wood. If you haven't seen him, just picture Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones with a fiddle, and you've pretty much got the idea, tight jeans and long hair and all. I happen to love Celtic music, but Dan literally winces and plugs his ears at the first faint sounds of fiddling. (Hey. Nobody said marriage was perfect.)To my delight, Dan fell in love with the artsy pulse of Charlottetown, and he enjoyed exploring the coastal roads, red beaches and rolling hills of the island as much as I did. On one of our trips, we discovered the Shipwright's Cafe in Margate, where the chefs rely on locally grown produce to cook innovative meals. Dan was equally happy with my favorite Charlottetown fish and chips place, Brits, where dinner is served on newspapers in baskets and the beer is always fresh. More importantly, the island worked its magical spell on my high-energy techie husband, causing him to relax.And so began our life as a family on Prince Edward Island. We had four children when we married -- a boy and girl from each side -- and added a child of our own a year later. Not long after your youngest son was born, we decided to buy a Victorian cottage in Hamilton, a tiny town outside of Summerside. The cottage cost less than most people pay to buy a new car in this country, and it was easy to rent out the cottage when we weren't using it, given its location close to the Anne of Green Gables attractions in Cavendish.There were just two small problems with the place: my favorite times to be on PEI are spring and fall, and our cottage had no insulation and hardly any heat. In addition, our kids craved outings to Basin Head, a beach at the eastern end of the island and nearly a two-hour drive from our cottage in central PEI.One August, about four years after buying the cottage, our family stayed at a friend's house near Souris because our cottage was being rented that particular week and it was the only week we could all make the vacation work. The last day of that vacation, it was pouring rain and the kids wanted to sleep late. Dan and I decided to take some rare time alone and drove to the easternmost end of the island.One of our stops was the East Point Lighthouse, where the Gulf of Saint Lawrence crashes into the Northumberland Strait. On a clear day, you can see the outline of Cape Breton from there.This wasn't one of those clear days. The water was pewter-colored and rough and the fog was coming in, so it was difficult to discern where the sea ended and the sky began. We were completely alone except for the seals bobbing in the roughest water where the tides meet.Someone had posted a sign here declaring the ""End of the World is Here."" Standing there, it was easy to believe it was true. Dan and I held hands in the light rain, facing out to sea, letting the wind tug at our clothing. Later, though I didn't know it then, this particular setting would provide inspiration in my newest novel, Chance Harbor.Afterward, we drove away and I turned down a road we'd never been on before, so we could drive back to my friend's house along a different route. About a mile down on the left was a ""for sale"" sign on the lawn in front of a late 19th-century house. The house, with its simple lines and steeply-pitched roof, and its trio of weathered barns, could have been the little sister of the farmhouse where author Lucy Maud Montgomery had set Anne of Green Gables. It was surrounded by flowering potato fields and completely abandoned. Down below the house, I could see sheep grazing in a field and a man on a red tractor.""This is our house,"" I declared, pulling into the driveway. ""It's the one we've been looking for.""""What? You're insane,"" Dan said, but he got out of the car and walked around the house with me, inspecting it from every angle. ""Roof needs work,"" he said. Then, seeing me on my phone, ""Wait, who are you calling?""""The realtor.""""Come on,"" Dan said. ""We already have a house.""""A cottage,"" I corrected, and then said hello when the realtor answered.The realtor was busy with his family, he said, and apologized. He couldn't show us the house and didn't know anyone else who might be willing to trek out to the eastern end of the island on short notice, either.""Are you sure?"" I asked. ""The thing is, we're leaving early tomorrow.""""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I have a family.""I felt desperate. What if we lost the house?We didn't. Within a week, we had made an offer over the phone, without ever having stepped foot inside it. Would the house be a disaster? Would we like it as much on the inside as we did on the outside?We'd have to come back in October for the home inspection. Meanwhile, all we could do was hope we'd made the right move.

They're the gang in the clown car climbing all over each other to offer a reactionary message of disarray that has all but destroyed the chances of the Bush family dynasty continuing. But isn't that a grand achievement for the democratic process?Why continue a political legacy that has failed in so many dramatic ways to serve the needs of the American public, instead giving us irrational but high-tech wars dealing death from the skies, heartless banking deregulation boosting the fortunes of the rich at the expense of the vast majority, and a vast state apparatus of surveillance enforced by the imprisonment of any whistleblowers who dare reveal its existence?Good riddance to bad rubbish, except that the alternatives of Trump, Fiorina or Carson only make Jeb Bush look stunningly reasonable in comparison. The other problem is that Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic candidate, is not fundamentally different from the scion of the Bush dynasty. She is instead a perfect stand-in for Jeb Bush if, as appears likely, the Republican Party should reject him for the sin, as with House Speaker John Boehner, of appearing too moderate. For Democrats, appearing moderate is quite easy, as Clinton proved as a senator and secretary of state: Just carry water for the military-industrial complex and Wall Street while pretending to be concerned about the ordinary folks who suffer from those costly policies.Clinton, in rhetoric and action, will never allow a Republican opponent to appear more hawkish than herself. In the general election, she will burnish her record of support for every bit of military folly from George W.'s invasion of Iraq to her own engineering of the campaign to overthrow all secular dictators in the Middle East who have proved to be an inconvenience to the Saudi theocracy.  During her tenure in the Obama administration, Clinton, by her own frequent boastful admission, was the hawk in the Cabinet pressuring the president to be even more aggressive in his drone assassinations and murderous air wars, which have destabilized the region and created what the pope recently termed the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.But it is the still troubled economy that will dominate the election, and it is the failure of the Democratic Party establishment--now represented singularly by Clinton--to deal with the lingering recession that explains the startling rise of Bernie Sanders as a viable candidate.The Vermont senator's success is not a result of charisma or image manipulation, both of which he quite properly treats as dangerous distractions from what ails us, but rather his deeply informed critique of the bipartisan policies of Presidents Clinton and Bush that have brought so much misery in their wakes.What makes Sanders appear less formidable to the party bosses is that although he is now matching Hillary Clinton in the all-important fundraising category, he has received mainly small contributions. That and the fact that his positions on health care and banking regulation take on entrenched moneyed interests rather than cravenly cater to them.Whereas Sanders supports the efforts by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. John McCain to restore the Glass-Steagall barrier against merging commercial and investment banking, Clinton still insists her husband did the right thing in signing off on the reversal of the sensible banking practice initiated by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to prevent another Great Depression.A year after he approved the destruction of the Glass-Steagall Act, Bill Clinton signed off on an even more egregious enabler of banking greed called the Commodity Futures Modernization Act that certainly enhanced Hillary's future Senate fundraising prospects. Even then-Rep. Bernie Sanders fell for that one. Only four members of the House, Ron Paul among them, had the courage and wisdom to vote against legislation that banned any regulation of the newfangled default swaps and collateralized debt obligations that came close to wrecking the world's economy.Hopefully Sanders has learned from that moment not to trust the Clintons to guard against the chicanery of bankers. He should challenge Hillary's claimed concern for the well-being of black and brown people, who right now are her advantage in polling. As the St. Louis Federal Reserve recently reported, even college-educated minorities were particularly devastated by the mortgage scams made legal through Bill Clinton's banking ""modernization.""What voters of every racial or ethnic group should understand is that the Clinton gift--worth billions to the banking industry--robbed all working Americans of the opportunity to improve their lot, as shown by the astounding growth in wealth inequality since the Clinton presidency.Are we really ready for another Clinton?"
