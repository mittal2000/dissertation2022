It probably has to do with the sensitivity we feel about our image/appearance. I'm referring to many who neglect their image by not really making enough effort to further enhance their appearance, or take enough care. Often, this a symptom of a lack of self belief, or just plain disinterest. Taking care of your personal style is integral to authentically communicating your ""personal brand"" and doing so as if you are proud of it. When we neglect our ""outer brand,"" that's to say, our attire, grooming and physical appearance, we come across as unprofessional. Needless to say, coming across as unprofessional is unacceptable in today's world. Taking stock of how your image currently represents you as you are today is a good place to start. Ask yourself how you'd like to come across, then ask yourself how you believe others perceive you. Now consider if you project yourself in a way that truly represents your personal tastes, your lifestyle, or that says something about you that's unique. Maybe that you wear a special kind of watch, or pieces of antique jewelry. In short, do you dress and groom yourself in ways that enable you to feel your best? Moreover, do you feel that your ability to communicate your outer brand is as effective as you would like? If your answer is something like, ""I'm not sure,"" join a large number of men and women who are in the same boat as you.  To review your personal style, the first thing to do is a ""wardrobe analysis."" Dispense any items that are no longer appropriate for you. Perhaps they no longer fit or have seen better days. After you've achieved this often challenging task, you'll be left with both physical and emotional space. Now you can see what's missing and needs replacing. Important: Don't rush out to go shopping. Give yourself time to reflect on your emptier wardrobe. Next, take the items you've discarded to your local charity shop or recycling center. And when you go shopping, ensure you feel your best; this way, your confidence level will enable you to make better decisions. The first thing to do is to just look around at shops so you can familiarize yourself with what clothes and accessories are on offer. After you've had a good look round, remember the items you saw that you really liked. Perhaps write down your favourites. Then, revisit those stores and ensure you locate a sales assistant who you resonate with or just feels right for you. Now, try some items on, and make sure they fit your shape, complement your colouring, feel comfortable, suit your budget, and will work well with what you have left in your wardrobe. Restrict your purchases to three items -- that way you won't feel overwhelmed or confused. Perhaps a suit, or a pair of slacks, maybe a blouse/shirt, a pair of shoes, or a jacket to begin with. This way, you'll start the process of creating and developing a personal style that is both unique and authentic.To learn more about Malcolm Levene, visit www.malcolmlevene.comFor more by Malcolm Levene, click here.For more on success and motivation, click here."

Standing with his two daughters at their house in Howell, Michigan, Cary said that he now would await the results of a test for meningitis after he also received an injection.""I'm fine right now. I'm waiting to see if anything develops,"" Cary said.Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include headache, fever and nausea. Fungal meningitis, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, is not contagious.One of the dead in Tennessee, 80-year-old Reba Temple, was a former health director for rural Hickman County.""She was a wonderful, wonderful lady,"" said County Trustee Cheryl Chessor, who attended the same church as Temple, Centerville Church of Christ. INCUBATION PERIOD LONGER THAN FIRST THOUGHTThe number of people sickened nationwide reached 121 on Tuesday, an increase of 16 cases from Monday.The potentially tainted steroid vials, which have been recalled, were shipped to 76 facilities in 23 states and some 13,000 people may have received injections from the medications, the CDC has said.Tennessee Health Commissioner Dr. John Dreyzehner said it could be early November before all the patients stricken with meningitis are identified.This is because the incubation period may be longer than the one month health experts first thought. Of the patients who contracted meningitis in Tennessee, the latest case was reported 42 days after the injection, he said on Tuesday.In Tennessee, Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center in Nashville received 2,000 vials of recalled steroid, the most of any facility in the nation.The New Jersey Department of Health said a 70-year-old Cumberland County man was hospitalized with apparent fungal meningitis, the first case in that state.""He developed headaches and went to the emergency room with fever and continued headaches,"" the New Jersey agency said, adding that he was receiving anti-fungal medication at South Jersey Healthcare Regional Medical Center in Vineland.The Florida Department of Health said six cases of the disease had been reported so far in the state, all in Marion County, with one death. STRICTER REGULATION SOUGHTThe federal Food and Drug Administration regulates only the ingredients and not the compounders, which are subject to a patchwork of state oversight.Three Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives called on Tuesday for a congressional probe of the meningitis outbreak.A fourth Democrat, Representative Edward Markey, whose Massachusetts district includes Framingham, said separately that he would introduce legislation to strengthen FDA's regulatory authority.But the office of the Republican chairman of the committee that would consider Markey's proposal, Fred Upton, did not respond to requests seeking comment.""This incident raises serious concerns about the scope of the practice of pharmacy compounding in the United States and the current patchwork of federal and state laws,"" the Democrats Henry Waxman, Frank Pallone and Diana DeGette said in a letter.Tennessee has reported six deaths and 39 cases of meningitis, followed by Michigan with three deaths and 25 cases, Virginia with one death and 24 cases and Maryland with one death and eight cases.The other states with cases are Indiana (12), Florida (6), Minnesota (3), North Carolina (2), Ohio (1) and New Jersey (1)."

Mitt Romney says what this country needs is a president with experience in creating jobs.The truth is that neither camp is admitting the truth.If you want to know what's really behind the absence of employment of the type that created and sustained generations of American workers, forget the politicians and listen to American Airlines. From a recent story from CNN/Money called American Airlines to lay out cuts to unions...AMR Corp. said at the time of its Nov. 29 bankruptcy filing that it was forced to file because of the need to achieve a more competitive labor structure. Most other major U.S. airlines have already cut labor costs by their own trips through bankruptcy over the last 10 years.Today, American Airlines employs about 9,000 union mechanics who do the heavy maintenance on their planes. Most are in Tulsa, Okla., with the rest in Dallas. They're highly skilled and efficient, but they earn about three times more than their counterparts in China and South and Central America.So in order to compete with the other airlines that have already outsourced this work, American Airlines is saying it needs to follow suit. And since they promised not to do this in previously signed union contracts, they'll simply get rid of those prior obligations by filing bankruptcy.And those 9,000 maintenance jobs are the tip of the iceberg. According to the story above, American intends to reduce its labor force by more than 80,000. Lowering their labor cost is the primary reason for filing bankruptcy in the first place. Here's a quote from the Nov. 29, 2011, CNN/Money article about the bankruptcy filing...He (Thomas Horton, American Airlines Chairman and CEO) said that American is paying $800 million a year more in labor costs than it would be if it had labor contracts comparable to its competitors.The American labor market is too complex to fault one company, industry, or trend. But there's little doubt that what's shrinking our middle class isn't high taxes, stifling regulations, or a president without experience creating jobs. It's simply that countless companies are finding ways to do the work with fewer American employees - and paying less to those they retain.Why are they doing it? Because they can Imagine you owned a business and could hire workers for one-third the pay. Would you? What if you could use the threat of hiring lower-paid workers as leverage to force your existing staff to accept lower pay. Would you? If you answered ""no"" to these questions, then answer this one...What if your competitors used lower-paid staff and, by continuing to pay your employees more, you were unable to compete and went out of business. Would that make you feel better?American Airlines and other companies like it aren't the bad guys. They simply have the ability to get the job done for less - and they're taking it like anyone else would.One of the most valuable companies in the world is Apple. Most of their products are made in China by workers making a tiny fraction of what Americans make. In India, you can hire an MBA for your IT department for $6,000 a year. Walmart stocks its aisles with products made in countries with vastly lower labor rates than those here.And Americans have been demonstrating for decades that in order to get the lowest prices on everything from clothes to iPhones, they're willing to sacrifice their neighbors' jobs.What's the solution? If you ask Mitt Romney, the solution is less government interference. Here's what he says about jobs on his website...Mitt Romney will rebuild the foundations of the American economy on the principles of free enterprise, hard work, and innovation. His plan seeks to reduce taxes, spending, regulation, and government programs. It seeks to increase trade, energy production, human capital, and labor flexibility.If you ask President Obama, it's about using government to train more Americans for jobs. From a recent AP report: President Barack Obama called on Congress Monday to create an $8 billion fund to train community college students for high-growth industries, giving a financial incentive to schools whose graduates are getting jobs.Reducing taxes and regulations in no way addresses this problem. Job training, on the other hand, at least goes in the right direction: If you're an American Airline mechanic, you'll certainly appreciate learning marketable computer skills when your job goes to Central America. But it's disheartening that while both campaigns are undoubtedly aware of the underlying issue - it's not complicated - neither seems willing to acknowledge its existence. The undeniable facts: 1. Lower prices on the things we buy is good, because it raises our standard of living. 2. Companies like American Airlines and Apple are obligated to reduce their costs to deliver goods and services at the lowest price. If they can, they will. 3. Achieving lower labor costs via outsourcing has an inevitable result: fewer high-paying blue collar American jobs and a shrinking middle class. Both candidates are whistling in the dark, and every news outlet is ignoring the obvious: When it comes to anemic job growth and a shrinking middle class, keeping this president won't change the facts, nor will electing a different one."

The EIA based its pricing assumptions on near-normal temperatures for this winter.Natural gas consumers, which account for about half of U.S. homes, should expect to pay 15 percent, or $89, more than last winter, due primarily to forecasts of higher consumption.Residential natural gas prices for the Northeast are seen rising by 4 percent during the winter months, while in the South prices are seen declining by 3 percent, according to the EIA forecast."

The firm, an offshoot of British tycoon Richard Branson's Virgin Group, expects to launch commercial service in late 2013 or 2014.The singer will be the first space tourist aboard Russia's Soyuz spaceship since 2009 after seats on the three-person craft became scarce when NASA mothballed its shuttles, leaving Russian rockets as the only ones capable of carrying crews into orbit.But NASA is considering doubling the amount of time an astronaut spends on the orbital station to one year - to lay the groundwork for future missions deeper into space - potentially freeing up seats for tourist from 2015.A Russian space official Alexei Krasnov said Brightman's flight would likely be carried out in 2015.Brightman married composer Andrew Lloyd Webber in the 1980s and pursued a chart-topping solo career after they broke up in 1990, bringing classical music to a broader audience and selling millions of records along the way.(Reporting By Alissa De Carbonnel)"

From the footlights of the Theatre District to the flashbulbs of media center Bloomsbury, and the blinking neon of Soho's pulsing nightspots to the soft glow of Chinatown's dumpling houses, the West End offers a glimpse of London at its brightest. With such a bewilderingly diverse range of offerings, it can be hard not to be dazzled to distraction. So, let's break this down a bit. Want to connect with the stylish young professionals who run in this part of town? Make for media hub Bloomsbury, where high-profile publishers and digital media firms abound and cultural institutions like the British Museum and University of London set a smart, worldly tone. If you're here for hardcore networking with the most plugged-in set, check in at the Charlotte Street Hotel, but keep in mind that while it hums by day, even hotspots like this cool down after dark when the savvy crowd heads for the bright lights of neighboring districts. (If the demands of the job rule that out, grab a bite at Thai joint Busaba Eathai before buckling down.) Ready to swap your suit for something a little more unbuttoned? Whether you want to hobnob with clients or run with rock stars, the best areas to head are Soho and Fitzrovia, where the buzzing after-dark scenes welcome schmoozers and revelers of all stripes. For a party prelude, try cultured tapas bar Barrafina or rustic Italian joints Sardo or Bocca di Lupo. For a more electric experience, check in at a high-design hotel-cum-nightlife destination like The Soho Hotel or Sanderson. (Agua at the Sanderson spa is a great spot to rejuvenate pre-party.) Next, kick off a killer night on the town by hanging with the celeb crowd and nibbling on trendy Asian bites at Hakkasan before imbibing in its sexy bar area, Ling Ling at Hakkasan. Later on, mingle with the cocktail-connoisseur set at clubby Milk & Honey or head back to the hotel and scope the beautiful people at Sanderson's Long Bar or The Soho Hotel's Refuel Bar. If all that revelry leaves you tuckered out, then don your coolest shades (the West End's lights can be a bit too much sometimes) and indulge in an upscale chill-out session at some of the area's more laidback establishments, like artisan coffee shop Fernandez & Wells Café or Milanese bakery Princi. Once you've got your verve back, spend an afternoon making one-of-a-kind finds at extravagant fashion and furnishings emporium Liberty and Co. For a retreat from the sometimes exhausting West End scene, consider checking in at relaxed Firmdale properties (known for their eclectic Kit Kemp décor) Haymarket Hotel or Covent Garden Hotel. These hotels attract aesthetic-minded globetrotters looking for discreet R&R. In the Covent Garden area, you can browse eclectic offerings from arts and crafts to confectionary and clothes in the local markets (including Apple Market, East Colonnade Market, and Jubilee Market) or take a snack break at historic fish and chip shop Rock and Sole Plaice. In nearby Holburn, you can shop for quirky finds at underground silver and antiques market Silver Vaults, get massaged at the Spa at Chancery Court, seek inspiration for an artsy-intellectual West End lifestyle at Sir John Soane's Museum, or grab a classic British bite at gastropub Great Queen Street. Of course, no matter what your pleasure is in these parts, there are certain bright spots in the West End that no one can afford to miss. The National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery in Trafalgar Square are must-hits during daylight hours, as are the dim sum delights of nearby Chinatown (we suggest Jade Garden). After dark, swing by classic Leicester Square foodie hotspots like J Sheekey or The Ivy before indulging in a splashy hit musical. It's the ultimate bright-lights London experience! This is the third in a mini-series on the coolest neighborhoods in London. Our previous posts explored the upscale bohemian charms of Notting Hill and the edgy urban vibes of Shoreditch and surrounds.For more, see our Passport to the West End or follow our West End Guide on Foursquare."

Californians woke up to a shock Friday as overnight gasoline prices jumped by as much as 20 cents a gallon in some areas, ending a week of soaring costs that saw some stations close and others charge record prices. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c62791f00002c002132a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," SAN FRANCISCO/HOUSTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The unprecedented price spike that added more than 50 cents a gallon to California pump prices last week ended as quickly as it began, market analysts said, and consumers should see prices fall dramatically in the coming week. Political outrage, however, was still heating up as Senator Barbara Boxer joined calls for a federal investigation into possible market manipulation.  Prices started pulling back slightly on Monday afternoon, according to online filling station tracker Gas Buddy, after the American Automobile Association website reported they had hit a record of $4.668 per gallon on Monday morning. California Governor Jerry Brown's decision on Sunday to allow an immediate switch to ""winter-blend"" fuel was a big factor in driving wholesale prices down by 60 cents a gallon on Monday, market participants said. ""Retail prices will come down as hard as they went up,"" said David Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, an energy consultancy in Irvine, California. ""It went up 56 cents in a week, it will come down that fast."" The price spike alarmed consumers and politicians across a state that is famous for its love of the automobile. Senator Barbara Boxer on Monday called for a Department of Justice investigation into possible price manipulation in gasoline trading markets. Senator Dianne Feinstein on Sunday made a similar request to the Federal Trade Commission.  Reuters reported on Friday that oil traders said the price spike had ""many hallmarks of a classic short squeeze."" Multiple trading sources said that refiner Tesoro Corp. was caught short of supplies and forced to scramble to buy fuel from other companies.  Spot market prices jumped by almost $1 a gallon in a matter of days, though trading sources said they saw no signs of collusion or deliberate withholding of supply. Both Feinstein and Boxer cited the Reuters report of a possible short squeeze in calling for federal regulators to investigate. Boxer, in her letter to the Department of Justice, asked it to ""immediately investigate whether any of these traders colluded to manipulate and drive up gas prices at the expense of Tesoro and California consumers"".  BITTER MEMORIES Californians have bitter memories of the supply shortages and price spikes that hit the electricity market more than a decade ago and were later found to have resulted from market manipulation led by the now-defunct Enron Corp. Jason M. Jones, a music producer who was gassing up his Volvo in Santa Monica on Monday, said he was fearful of further price gyrations. ""I feel they're taking advantage of the situation in Santa Monica,"" he said. California gasoline prices are traditionally among the highest in the country. The state is largely cut off from national pipeline networks and refinery centers, and requires more expensive, cleaner-burning gasoline in the summer. The recent price surge was initially set off by a series of refinery mishaps, including an August 6 fire at a big Chevron refinery in Richmond and an Oct. 1 power outage at Exxon Mobil Corp's Torrance facility near Los Angeles.  The Torrance plant is now back online, helping to alleviate supply constraints. Brown's order to allow winter-blend gasoline to be sold immediately, well ahead of the normal Oct. 31 transition date, was also a big factor in relieving supply concerns. ""I think prices will come down pretty quickly,"" said James Hamilton, an economics professor at the University of California, San Diego. ""The measures Governor Brown adopted are exactly the right ones.""  SLUGGISH PRICES BOTH WAYS Hamilton acknowledged that some academic studies show it can take a ""little bit longer"" for prices to come down than it takes for them to go up. But he detected sluggishness in both directions, suggesting some Southern California retailers may have been wary of angering customers by increasing too fast. ""A few stations didn't raise prices as quickly as others, and that created shortages at those stations,"" he said. Southern California bore the brunt of the supply disruptions last week and faced the highest prices in the state, with $5 per gallon spotted in some areas. At one station in West Los Angeles, Rick Lee, a restaurant and club manager in his 40s, said he had not yet noticed a fall in prices. ""For now I'm just putting in $40 at a time and not filling up my tank in anticipation that prices will go down or that someone will bail us out,"" he said.

According to LinkedIn and Citi's study of professional women's biggest financial and career concerns, women draw distinct lines between which conversations are appropriate for social networks (such as LinkedIn and Facebook), and which topics are off-limits. While more than half of the respondents say that job searches, career topics, and recent promotions are fine to discuss on professional social media sites, 70 percent of respondents say that salary discussions are best done in person or over the phone. In other words, where there's no paper trail or newsfeed that'll land you in an HR office near you.It's always important, however, to do a little research on salary matters or perhaps get support on personal financial matters. Given the taboos, how can you talk about money online, and with whom? Here are some tips:1. Your partner or spouse should be a safe bet.  With the exceptions of your salary and monthly expenses, you can open up to your close friends or family members -- more than half of survey respondents reported that they did. 2. Opening up to colleagues about salary is a no-no.  Simply put, it's no one's business how much you make, and discussions like these can spread like wildfire through an office. Knowledge about salaries can help you with negotiations, so a safer option to do your investigative work is to use a site like SalaryShare, which allows you to pool information anonymously with a group of participants that could potentially extend Zip codes beyond your sixth-floor water cooler. 3. Don't pick apart your paycheck in an online community.  If you're sloppy with your username, say if your Flickr account shares the same unusual username as the one you use in your online community, you're unknowingly identifying yourself. Eek! If you get busted complaining about your paycheck, you may not see one next week. It's best to keep online community discussions focused on job searches or your career questions.4. Consider participating in a professional networking group of trusted friends that connects via private email discussion.  Unless your significant other, closest friends, or immediate family members are in the same field, your professional financial questions could be too specific for them. The best professional financial advice I've received has been in response to questions I've posed to my long-trusted networking group via private email. If our email list was archived and posted online, there's no way our discussions would be as open about the dollar details.5. Pay attention to the rules.  If your networking group offers opt-in email lists, the organizers should also be clear about which topics are appropriate for which list, and then you might want to lurk for a bit before chiming in with financial topics so you don't break any unwritten rules. For example, a small business group might have a list for legal topics, which would be a good fit for your zoning question; it may also have a financial list, which is where you'd ask about salary trends for employees in your city, or recommendations for financing your next company car.6. When in doubt, rule it out.  When it comes to talking finances outside your home and especially online, your safest bet is stay on the cautious side.What other financial etiquette rules would you recommend?

Hall)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c614c3c0000320009bc7c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The outbreak of meningitis that has claimed 11 lives so far has brought to light a little-understood segment of the pharmaceutical industry: compounding pharmacies, which make their own concoctions of medicines and sell them directly to the public. The steroid-based back pain drug that has been linked to the outbreak was made and marketed by the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Mass., according to an Oct. 6 statement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. So what exactly are compounding pharmacies, and why are they allowed to make drugs and sell them largely outside of the bounds of the federally-regulated drug industry? I found the answers to some of those questions while researching my book about the anti-aging industry, Selling the Fountain of Youth. Compounding pharmacies have become high-profile members of the anti-aging industry because they offer hormones, supplements, and other medicines often prescribed by anti-aging doctors.First, a definition of compounding: The traditional role of compounding pharmacists is to take ingredients from commonly-marketed drugs and tailor them to the needs of specific patients. For example, compounders might turn pills into syrups for elderly patients who have trouble swallowing their medicines, or they might put a pain drug into a lollipop for a child with cancer. This is all perfectly legal.But over the last 15 years or so, a tangled web of conflicting laws and rulings has raised questions about what, exactly, compounding pharmacies are allowed to do. The problems started in 1997 with the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), which exempted compounders from having to abide by the strict quality control practices that major pharmaceutical companies have to follow. Under FDAMA, compounding pharmacies also don't have to seek FDA approval for the medicines they make, provided they use ingredients from drugs that have already been approved and that they don't advertise their products.According to a recent report by the AP, the New England Compounding Center created the back pain drug -- a steroid called preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate -- by combining a powder-based substance with a liquid. The pharmacy's website says that drug and other products have been recalled voluntarily.The FDA does claim some control over compounding pharmacists. In 2002, the agency reissued a ""compliance policy guide"" on compounding, which lays out several requirements. For example, the guide says the FDA can take action against pharmacies that make bulk quantities of compounded drugs in anticipation of receiving prescriptions -- a major no-no for compounding pharmacies, which are supposed to make drugs in response to a physician's prescription.The FDA reissued the compliance guide in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling in Thompson v. Western States Medical Center -- a case in which a group of compounding pharmacists challenged the advertising restrictions in FDAMA on the grounds that they violated their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court agreed with the pharmacists, effectively striking down the compounding restrictions in FDAMA as unconstitutional. Ever since the FDA decided to take control over compounding by reissuing its compliance guide, there's been a war between the compounders, who believe their rights are protected by the Supreme Court, and the FDA, which believes it needs to protect public health by holding these pharmacies to strict standards of manufacturing and marketing.In 2009, when I was reporting my book, I visited an official at the FDA named Steven Silverman, who had dealt with compounding issues as an assistant director in the FDA's office of compliance. I asked him what could be done to clarify and perhaps strengthen the restrictions on compounding pharmacies. ""Congress can amend our legislation to make it clear what it is they want the [FDA] to do,"" he told me. Or, he said, the FDA could petition the Supreme Court to revisit the issue.So far, neither one of those scenarios has been pursued. But it will be interesting to see if the current meningitis crisis prompts the federal government to take a fresh look at the rules and regulations governing compounding pharmacies.For more by Arlene Weintraub, click here.For more health news, click here.
