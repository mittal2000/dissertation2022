With the quarterfinal clash scoreless into its 120th minute and headed for a penalty shootout, Dutch coach Louis van Gaal made a bold substitution that paid off for his side: Reserve goalkeeper Tim Krul came on to replace starter Jasper Cillessen in net. The rangy 6' 3"" reserve keeper produced two diving saves to help the Netherlands prevail 4-3 in the penalty shootout at Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador on Saturday. Krul dove to the correct side of his goal for each penalty kick taken by Costa Rica and saved the shots from Bryan Ruiz and Michael Umana to send the Netherlands through to the World Cup semifinals.Until Krul's improbable entrance into the game, the goalkeeping star had been Costa Rica's Keylor Navas. He stymied the formidable Dutch attack through extra time but was unable to produce a save during the penalty shootout. Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt all converted their penalty kicks with clinical calm that left little chance for Navas. ""I think we created a lot of chance and we couldn't score,"" Sneijder told ESPN's John Sutcliffe after the dramatic conclusion. ""We were a little bit unlucky. We hit the post. We hit the bar. We had, like I said, a lot of chances. But finally we won. I think tonight we definitely deserved to win. There was our only goal to go to the semifinal and we are there now. We have to recover well because it was a heavy match, a tough match.""The Netherlands will face Argentina in the semifinals on July 9 at Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo."

Carlos Urrutigoity, an Argentinian-born priest accused of sexually molesting minors when he served as a priest in Scranton more than a decade ago.Urrutigoity is now second in command in Ciudad del Este and his career advance has provoked widespread debate among local bishops as well as opposition from the victims’ support group SNAP.Urrutigoity was accused of sexual abuse in a highly publicized lawsuit in Scranton in 2002. At the time he and another priest, Eric Ensey, were suspended by now-retired Bishop James Timlin, amid allegations they had sexually molested students at St. Gregory’s Academy in Elmhurst, now closed.Urrutigoity was transferred to Canada before settling in Paraguay but his Pennsylvania diocese has described him as a “serious threat to young people” on its website and reiterated the concern of Timlin’s successor, Bishop Joseph Martino, who resigned in 2009.“Martino also carefully and consistently expressed his grave doubts about this cleric’s suitability for priestly ministry and cautioned the Bishop of the Diocese of Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, to not allow Father Urrutigoity to incardinate into his diocese,” according to a statement on the diocese site, referring to the practice of a priest being placed under the jurisdiction of a different bishop.Last week the Vatican defrocked former papal envoy, Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, and he may face criminal prosecution at the Vatican after a church inquiry convicted him of child sexual abuse.Wesolowski, who is originally from Poland, was removed from his position in the Dominican Republic and recalled to the Vatican last August amid claims he had abused boys in Santo Domingo."

Yet, during any Brazil game during this World Cup, streets were deserted, beaches were empty, and every shop closed while millions of people huddled around TVs rigged to kiosks, bars, and outside homes across the country. Their passion for the game was not relegated to just its national team; Brazilians made every game a thrilling celebration of the sport. Empty Streets of Rio during the Brazil-Chile Matchup (Photo by Suraj Patel)If you watched TV leading up to the World Cup, you would say, ""Brazil, your country is out of control."" Every story about Brazil's hosting of the World Cup mentioned unfinished stadiums, poor infrastructure, rampant crime, and slowing economic growth, all of which threatened to make this most disastrous World Cup ever. Its passion for the game allowed Brazil to take the task of hosting the World Cup to a new level -- famously known for its partying culture, no country could possibly match the energy Brazil summoned for this event. Coupled with tropical weather and a culture that celebrates everyday of life outside, there's no doubt that the ultimate winners of this World Cup will be the attendees who will forever be left reminiscing about their time in that country. Makeshift ""Viewing Parties"" Crowding the Narrow Streets of Salvador (Photo by Suraj Patel)For sure, Brazil's hosting has had its share of serious issues and nothing short of a full inquiry and prosecution of everything from the city selection processes to grafts from contractors will suffice. And, by all accounts, FIFA's selection process is one of the most corrupt bidding processes of all international events -- a reputation not helped by back-to-back selections of Russia and Qatar. Several taxi drivers I spoke with privately hoped that Brazil would lose in the Cup so that people would not forget the widespread corruption that went into Brazil's hosting of the World Cup. Without a doubt, spending less on opulent stadiums and more on mass transit or crime reduction would have benefited the Brazilian population much more so and taken very little away from the quality of event for attendees.In fact, I know I would have been happier being able to take a reliable train to the stadium from Recife rather than the one-hour deathtrap of a moto-taxi ride I took through the flooded, traffic-snarled city. ""Death-trap"" Motorcycle Taxi Ride From Recife Stadium back to the Airport (Photo by Suraj Patel)However, despite those serious problems, the doomsday predictions of protests and strikes never materialized. Threats of gang warfare and widespread crimes went unrealized. And even though public opinion poll after poll showed that ordinary Brazilians were opposed to hosting the Cup, they've fully embraced their team, the international visitors, and the game. Maybe that what makes soccer the ""beautiful game,"" for in soccer, more so than any other sport, passion trumps logic. Our quantified measures like GDP and gini coefficients cannot fully ever capture intensity and quality. And despite economists' best efforts, humans are just not the fully rational, utility-maximizing, self-interested individuals they need to create their predictive models. This is a game that led two entire nations, Ghana and Ivory Coast, to share and ration electricity so that Ghana's people could watch their games! Economists would never predict that rational, profit-maximizing economic actors would voluntarily shut down the nation's main aluminum smelter to ensure that everyone could watch the games. Enough power or not, I doubt that people would remember the inconvenience over the experience. Brazil's hosting of the World Cup exemplifies this -- the thing that doomsday predictions about Brazil missed were the intangibles like passion, energy, and hope that can tip a game to an underdog. They're the same intangibles that lead you to sing in the shower, dance in front of a mirror, or go for a stroll - these things do not add to quantified measures like GDP and were not covered in the lead up to the World Cup, but once in a while, like in Brazil, they end up making rational predictions completely wrong. Overflow Crowds Watching Netherlands-Mexico on the Copacabana Beach  (Photo by Suraj Patel)An almost religious zeal-like focus on quantity in this era where everything ""big data"" is the future often makes us overlook those unquantifiable things are sometimes the things most worth remembering. Brazil created a World Cup where quantifiable factors, money spent on stadiums, and readiness will almost certainly be less than Russia or Qatar. But it more than made up for that by creating a Cup full of passion and dynamism. It's hard to think that Russia, or Qatar, or frankly anywhere could match that atmosphere. The Brazilians love for their game transcended anything imaginable. The entire country shut itself down, or maybe better put, turned itself on, for this World Cup, and because of that, we all won."

When I started to go on the road with (jazz drummer and bandleader) Art Blakey when I was 18, I started to do classes,"" Marsalis told Reuters in an interview.Sometime he teaches music - but not always.""I try to teach them mythology so they can recalibrate how they look at the world,"" said Marsalis, who has served as a United Nations goodwill ambassador.British jazz newcomers - vibraphonist Lewis Wright and saxophonist Nathaniel Facey - both more than held their own with the longer-standing JLCO professionals on the Wednesday, while Tuesday's performance featured the British-based Young Jazz East Big Band, which rehearsed with New York-based JLCO via Internet.Monday's gig was different altogether - a joint concert between two established bands - Marsalis's and Pakistan's Sachal Jazz Ensemble. The East meets West involved trombones, saxophones, sitars and tabla, naal and dholak drums.Such ranges in performance style is trademark Marsalis, who as well as his father, Ellis, counts three jazzmen among his brothers - Branford, Delfeayo and Jason.He has worked with acts as diverse as Sarah Vaughn, Dizzy Gillespie and Eric Clapton, and won a Pulitzer Prize for music and numerous Grammys for jazz and classical albums, including one for best spoken word album for children.""With my music I try to always have it have some type of rooting and a meaning,"" the New Orleans native said.""Maybe I have 70, 80 records that are out but I have another 60 or 70 that are not out. Each time I do another record I try to have another objective or try to do something I didn't do before."" (Editing by Mark Heinrich)"

But it earned a spot in the semifinals of the 2014 World Cup due to its grit. With a yellow-clad crowd behind them, Brazil held off Colombia 2-1 in a physical quarterfinal clash at Estadio Castelao in Fortaleza on Friday. A pair of Brazil defenders -- Thiago Silva and David Luiz -- contributed the first goals of the match before Colombia's James Rodriguez pulled one back from the penalty spot to ensure the drama lasted until the final whistle. The victory sends the hosts into a high-profile semifinal with Germany.After needing penalties to escape Chile in the Round of 16, Brazil seemed on course for a smoother victory against Colombia. In the seventh minute, Silva, wearing the captain's armband, scored after a corner kick by Neymar.Silva's goal would be the only one in the first half as Brazil took a slim 1-0 advantage into the intermission. In the 69th minute, Luiz doubled the advantage with a swerving free kick from 30 yards that eluded Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina.

In the 77th minute, Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar conceded a penalty by taking down Colombia forward Carlos Bacca. Rodriguez, the breakout star of the World Cup and a leading contender for the Golden Boot as the tournament's high scorer, calmly converted. Just minutes before the final whistle sounded on Brazil's 2-1 win, Neymar suffered an apparent back injury that could keep him out of the semifinals. In the 87th minute, Colombia's Juan Camilo Zuniga drove his right knee into Neymar's lower back.

The lawmakers argued that the ruling ""artificially conflated and improperly applied"" labor law in determining that the players were employees of the school and therefore covered under the law.""As a matter of policy and law, this is wrong: scholarship football players are not and should not be treated as ... employees,"" they wrote. ""The inevitable conclusion from the [regional director's] analysis in this case would lead to countless undergraduate students -- in a variety of extracurricular activities -- being considered employees of their colleges and universities.""With the backing of the United Steelworkers, Northwestern players had presented the labor board with a petition earlier this year seeking an election for their would-be union, the College Athletes Players Association. The players' case rested on the argument that college scholarships constitute a form of payment for services rendered and that Northwestern controlled the terms of those services.The players cleared the first hurdle to their potentially historic unionization effort in March, when Peter S. Ohr, the board's Chicago regional director, issued a ruling letting the election proceed.That decision, however, has been appealed to the five-member labor board in Washington, which can affirm or overturn Ohr's ruling. (Even if the board sides with the players, Northwestern can still take its case to federal court.) The election went ahead, but the ballots have been impounded until the board makes its determination.The brief from the six Republican lawmakers was one of a batch of amicus filings in the case on Thursday by interested groups. These include the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which isn't a formal party in the case but could see its entire model shaken by the outcome. In its brief in support of Northwestern, the NCAA contended that letting players unionize would lead to ""significant and irreversible, negative impact on the future of intercollegiate athletics and higher education in the United States.""The congressional Republicans on the filing were Rep. John Kline (Minn.), who chairs the House Committee on Education and the Workforce; Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.); Rep. Phil Roe (Tenn.); Sen. Johnny Isakson (Ga.); and Sen. Richard Burr (N.C.).Unions representing athletes in five pro sports -- MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL and NHL -- filed a joint brief in support of the college athletes on Thursday. "

And the Republican leadership is unwilling to stand up to their fear of a more diverse American future.,2014-07-04,"Estrella Manuel, 2, holds an American flag in her mouth during a news conference in Miami Wednesday, June 17, 2009. Roughly 150 children are suing President Barack Obama to halt the deportations of their parents until Congress overhauls U.S. immigration laws. The U.S.-born children say their constitutional rights are being violated because they, too, will likely have to leave the country if their parents are forced to leave. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6915722600000423b62d73.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Did you see the pictures from Tuesday in Murrieta, Calif.? Three buses were full of unaccompanied minors and mothers with children, all fleeing violence in Central America. According to American immigration officials, they were being taken by Homeland Security to a U.S. Border Patrol Station for processing and eventual deportation -- after being flown to San Diego from Texas, where they had walked across the U.S. border seeking safety. The buses of children were blocked by adults yelling that they weren't wanted here in the United States. Big angry white men, holding signs the children couldn't read, with angry faces screaming at them in a language they didn't understand -- when they were already alone and away from their families and home -- would certainly make children feel very afraid. Some of the kids were reportedly as young as six years old.The town mayor, Alan Long, said the children posed a threat to his community and that he was ""proud"" of the demonstrators. One hundred-and-fifty protesters waved American flags, chanted ""USA! USA!"" and shouted to the scared children, ""Go home -- we don't want you here."" Totally blocked from reaching the processing center, the buses turned around and left for another Border Patrol Station, where some of the children were reportedly taken to a hospital for unspecified treatment. More than 52,000 unaccompanied children from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras have walked across the U.S. border since last October -- some, unfortunately, by way of human trafficking networks though Mexico. Thousands more have come with their parents. The surge has overwhelmed the system and become a very serious humanitarian crisis to which U.S. officials are scrambling to respond. But this is being politicized in Washington.Incredibly, some Republicans have used this tragic situation as an excuse for why they scuttled immigration reform -- when having a smart, fair, and humane immigration system in place would have helped avoid this crisis.This horrible scene in California reminds me of an interaction during a talk I gave a few months ago on immigration.It turned out to be the most important immigration talk I've given this year -- and it was to my son's fifth grade class. They were studying the subject and invited me to speak about it. First, we went through the long history of immigration in this country. All the children in my son's class are part of our national history of people who chose to come to America (with the exception of those families forced by the chains of slavery). Next I told the students about our current problem of 11 million undocumented people living in uncertainty and fear for years and even decades, of families being separated, fathers and mothers from torn away from their children, and hardworking and law-abiding people being deported every day. Looking very surprised, these students asked the obvious question, ""Why don't we fix that? Why doesn't Congress change the system?""I answered, ""They say they're afraid.""The students looked even more confused and asked, ""What are they afraid of?""I paused to consider their honest question and looked around the room -- the classroom of a public school fifth-grade class in Washington D.C. I looked at their quizzical and concerned faces, a group of African-American, Hispanic, Asian-American, Native American, European, African children. Then it hit me.""They are afraid of you,"" I replied.""Why would they be afraid of us?"" the students asked, shocked. I had to tell them.""They are afraid you are the future of America. They are afraid their country will someday look like this class -- that you represent what our nation is becoming.""This multiracial, multicultural, and multinational group of 11-year-olds now looked more confused than ever.""They are afraid this won't work,"" I said. ""Does it work?""The children looked at each other, then responded with many voices, saying, ""Yeah.. .Sure... Of course it works... It works great... It's really cool!""Together we decided that our job was to show the rest of the country that this new America coming into being is, in fact, really cool.Our long battle for comprehensive immigration reform was recently officially ended in Congress by Speaker John Boehner. The leader of the Republican House of Representatives told the President that he would not allow a vote for reform to be brought up -- even though it is widely believed that a vote to fix this broken system would pass were it to come up in the House and the Senate.Speaker Boehner and his Republican leaders themselves admit this is only about politics. Most Americans of every political stripe believe the current system is untenable and must be fixed. A large coalition from the faith community, the business community, and law enforcement officials says that reform makes common sense, is good for the economy, is good for national security and public safety, is good for keeping families together -- in short, is a moral imperative. But that is being obstructed by a vocal group of white conservative lawmakers who are motivated by political and racial fear and hatred. Many conservative Republicans have more or less admitted that those feelings are very present in the constituencies they represent. And the Republican leadership is unwilling to stand up to their fear of a more diverse American future.This is political obstruction of the common good, and it is a moral failure. This week, in a meeting with President Barack Obama, faith leaders asked the president to do everything he can, within his Constitutional authority, to ""relieve the suffering"" of all the families and children who will continue to be devastated. Let me say this very clearly: Those who have morally failed to fix this broken system must dare not now try to prevent executive orders to protect the people we love, who have become part of ""us,"" and whom Christ asks us to protect. If Republicans continue to ignore and cause the suffering of all ""the strangers"" among us, they will have to answer to the faith community. Jim Wallis is president of Sojourners.

While ""Born In The U.S.A."" may sound like a patriotic ode to 'Merica, it's actually much darker than that. Springsteen wrote the song about a working-class Vietnam veteran who feels isolated from the government and his fellow countrymen. In a 1984 Rolling Stone interview, Springsteen revealed that he thought ""the country took advantage of their [Vietnam Veterans'] selflessness.""Buuuuut that's pretty heavy for a July Fourth celebration, so let's resume with 10 times Bruce made us feel proud to be born in the U.S.A:When he absolutely crushed his performance at our nation's favorite unofficial holiday, the Super Bowl, in 2009:And did a full on knee-slide into the camera, because he just doesn't care:  When he bestowed upon us the hottest Americana album cover this world has ever seen in 1984: And again with the hottest Rolling Stone cover, on which he was named the voice of the decade: When he casually chilled with President Obama and Jay Z like it was no biggie before a rally in Columbus:When he carried the weight of a child on his shoulders (no, really):When he most literally inspired this girl's entire life: When he auctioned the shirt and guitar off his back and raised $160,000 for injured veterans: When he proved he's still got it by crowd surfing into the audience: And then chugging a fan's beer because, well, he can:So thanks Bruce.

A scan revealed a chronic subdural hematoma, aka bleeding in the brain. The cause? The man had been banging his head at a Motörhead concert. Doctors had to drill a hole into the man's skull, remove a clot and then drain the brain for six days. He recovered completely, and now almost certainly has the ultimate bragging rights at any metalhead gathering. Despite the incident, experts say headbangers shouldn't worry too much about brain bleeds. ""There are probably other higher risk events going on at rock concerts than headbanging,"" Dr. Colin Shieff, a neurosurgeon and trustee of the British brain injury advocacy group Headway told the Associated Press. ""Most people who go to music festivals and jump up and down while shaking their heads don't end up in the hands of a neurosurgeon.""The study's authors agree. ""We are not smartasses who advise against headbanging,"" lead author Dr. Ariyan Pirayesh Islamian of the Hannover Medical School in Germany told the CBC.""Our purpose was not only to entertain the readership with a quite comical case report on complications of headbanging that confirms the reputation of Motörhead as undoubtedly one of the hardest rock 'n' roll bands on Earth, but to sensitize the medical world for a certain subgroup of fans that may be endangered when indulging themselves in excessive headbanging,"" he said.Yes, that's right. Science officially confirms that Motörhead is ""one of the hardest rock 'n' roll bands on Earth.""Not bad when you consider that Motörhead singer-bassist Lemmy Kilmister is 68 years old and rocking with a defibrillator.
