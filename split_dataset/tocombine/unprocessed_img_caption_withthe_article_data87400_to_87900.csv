News reports that Kim Richards will not return to ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" for the show's sixth season. Sources connected to the reality show tell the website that while it's possible she may come back for a cameo, or a few appearances, she won't be a full-time cast member. The 50-year-old, who has been a cast member on the reality series since it first premiered in 2010, returned to rehab on Tuesday after briefly leaving a treatment facility to attend her daughter's wedding in Mexico. Richards was arrested in April and later charged with public intoxication, trespassing, resisting an officer and battery on a police officer. She checked into rehab less than two weeks later. Bravo had no comment. "

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14ed7240000500024fdce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alfred Romann -- OZYStepping into this particular evening — the ambiance, the dress, the music — is a throwback to the 1950s. Here, a man in a pin-striped, three-piece suit with a rose in his lapel dances close to a young woman with beautifully dark hair and a black dress that’s held up with just a thin spaghetti strap. There, another man in a shiny gray suit over a gray shirt and a gray tie leads a woman across the dance floor as her legs dart through a flowered dress with a (very) high leg slit. The familiar twang of the tango fills the air as we breathe in the beauty of … Buenos Aires? Hardly. This is Hong Kong.Argentina may very well be the birthplace of this sensually dramatic dance, but more of the industry’s growth these days is being led by Asia. Unassuming Asians — professionals by day, dancers by night — attend milongas (tango-infused parties), pay for private lessons that can top $200 and even travel more than 11,400 miles to Buenos Aires to dance with the industry’s biggest names. That is, when the most famous dancers aren’t flown into Asia for special workshop performances. The bad news for some dedicated, if not fanatical, followers here is that they may have just missed the Seoul Tango Festival, though over in Japan there are dozens of milongas going on any given week — and, in India, tango groups and associations are popping up everywhere from Jakarta to New Delhi.In this part of the world, tango has more of a cult following than mass appeal. In Hong Kong, for example, dances like the tango or even the flamenco appeal to a younger generation looking to fill both social and exercise needs. Locals “go crazy” for those dances, says Anna Chan, head of artistic development for dance at the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, the city’s new government-sponsored arts hub. In other parts of Asia, such as Japan and mainland China, the younger generation can be spotted taking part in tangolike dancing as a form of entertainment, visible almost every evening in parks around the country much like, say, breakdancing might be seen in North America.But understanding how the tango first maneuvered onto this continent requires stepping back to see how it started — early last century in the smoke-filled bars near the port in Buenos Aires. The lyrics then, full of struggle and macho romance and Argentine slang, had a lot in common with the blues but gave way to a dance style that emerged over time. Those moves eventually pushed into Asia thanks to Baron Tsunayoshi Megata (that’s Tsunami Megata to his friends), the grandson of a samurai warrior and son of a diplomat. Megata lived in Paris for six years, until 1926, where he learned to dance. Back in his homeland of Japan, he opened an academy then wrote a book, A Method to Dance the Argentine Tango, and the first Argentine orchestra played in Japan in 1954.Meanwhile, in Argentina, tango’s popularity was waning. It wasn’t until three decades later that the musical Tango Argentino brought the focus back to Argentina. Carlos Rivarola was one of the key dancers in that show, which was held in Paris and Broadway and attracted all sorts of A-listers. He was later cast in Tango, an Argentine film that was nominated for an Oscar in 1999.Despite these successes, making money at home proved quite difficult for Rivarola and his foot-moving peers. And it fell on communities in Europe and Asia to financially prop up tango, which was included on UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2009. “All of us who live off tango make our money outside Argentina,” Rivarola tells OZY. While he’s been visiting Japan for years, the 63-year-old also traveled to Singapore and Hong Kong earlier this year to teach dance classes and perform as demand for his talents there has been rising.Indeed, even in Hong Kong, which still has one of the smaller tango communities on the continent, there’s an event related to the dance almost every night, says Ka-mong Lee, who learned to tango in 1999 then quit his job as a graphic designer four years ago to teach the dance full time. During one recent evening, Lee, his wife and his dance partner were among a group of dancers who opened for Rivarola and his partner, Gladys Fernandez, another Argentine dancer whom many credit with launching tango in Hong Kong.Now, with the help of enthusiasts like Lee, the tango torch just might get passed to a new generation of tangueros — if they’re willing to shake it on the dance floor. “Chinese people sometimes feel shy,” Lee says. “You have to help them through.”"

Elizabeth Esty (D-CT) about background checks for gun purchases at the Canon House Office Building on Capitol Hill March 4, 2015 in Washington, DC. The bipartisan King-Thompson Public Safety legislation is aimed at keeping guns from criminals & dangerously mentally ill by enforcing background checks for online and gun show purchases. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fdf31f00000002257fe5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Americans' overall appetite for stricter gun laws may have dropped since the Newtown shooting, but a newly released study shows that, more than two years later, public approval for many specific gun proposals remains strong.Support for gun control as a general concept has been on the wane for years, as the issue has become increasingly polarized along party lines -- and while the 2012 mass shooting brought a pronounced spike, it soon receded. Gallup surveys found that the percentage of Americans calling for stricter laws on gun sales soared to 58 percent after the Newtown shooting before quickly returning to a near-low of 47 percent. A Pew Research poll conducted last December found that, for the first time in more than 20 years, the right to gun ownership was considered more important than gun control. The authors of one study, conducted by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, worried the same might have happened to opinions on specific policies like background checks and a ban on assault weapons. In a previous survey, they'd found widespread public support for such measures -- but it was conducted two weeks after the shooting, when emotions were running high.A follow-up conducted this January, however, found relatively little change in opinions. Eighty-four percent of Americans still favor requiring a background check system for all gun sales, while two-thirds or more favor policies such as banning the sale of large-capacity clips and semiautomatic assault weapons.The largest change was a 10-point drop for prohibiting a person convicted of a serious crime as a juvenile from having a gun for 10 years, which remains popular at about 73 percent.""Frankly, for me it was surprising to see that the results stayed so high,"" said Colleen Barry, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins and the lead author of the study. In 2013, she said, ""there was a certain mood in the country at that point in the context of such a tragedy. Our survey results could have very easily reflected that mood in a way that wouldn't be stable over time.""The study found that when support did erode, it was mostly among Americans who didn't themselves own guns.""I think the big takeaway from this study is that for a broad range of policies, we see high levels of support in the general public, and among both gun owners and non-gun owners -- and that the difference between those two groups is smaller than is typically communicated,"" Barry said. Still, as the study's authors note, public opinion on those proposals hasn't translated into many legislative victories for the gun control movement. ""Despite broad popular support for specific measures to keep guns from dangerous individuals, opponents of stronger gun laws have been more organized, singularly focused, and, until recently, better funded than supporters of these laws,"" they write in the Preventitive Medicine journal.The Johns Hopkins poll was conducted Jan. 2-16 using the online GfK KnowledgePanel to survey 1,326 adults, including 524 gun owners."

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fdf03c000018010e0438.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is “in la la land” when it comes to its policies on processing Freedom of Information Act requests, according to a top House Republican.In back-to-back hearings spanning two days, the House Oversight and Government Reforms Committee scrutinized the administration’s practices over FOIA requests -- a tool that allows the public to ask federal agencies for information or documents about any issue. It’s a resource commonly used by journalists, who rely on it to find data, emails, transcripts and other informations agencies would otherwise keep private.On Wednesday, during the second marathon hearing held by the Oversight Committee this week, Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) expressed deep frustrations with agency officials. Chaffetz pressed Melanie Anne Pustay, director of information policy for the Justice Department, on the credibility of a scorecard the department created to measure how well agencies handle FOIA programs. The agency had given itself a perfect score. Referencing Tuesday’s hearing on FOIA transparency, which included testimony from 12 individuals representing news outlets, nonprofits and advocacy groups, Chaffetz said no one had been happy with the way FOIA requests were being handled.“Are you kidding me? The DOJ gives themselves a five out of five on proactive disclosure? You really think anybody in the world believes the Department of Justice is at the top of their game?” Chaffetz said.“I do. I absolutely do,” Pustay responded.“Man, you live in la la land, you live in fantasy land, 'cause it ain’t working,” Chaffetz interjected. “We are at the heart of why I think there is a problem: Because you all thing you’re doing a great job.”Chaffetz said that since President Barack Obama took office in 2009, roughly 550,000 requests had been rejected.Earlier this year, an Associated Press report revealed the administration had set a record again for restricting access to government files. The analysis found that the backlog of FOIA requests grew in 2014 by 55 percent, and the government cut 9 percent of the full-time employees dedicated to search for records. Frustration with the administration crossed party lines on Wednesday as Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said the testimony heard by the committee during the two-day hearing series vastly contradicted each other. During testimonies from the American Civil Liberties Union, The New York Times, Vice News and other groups on Tuesday, lawmakers said everyone shared stories of FOIA requests going unanswered well past the 20-day window the law permits, including a number of requests that stretched on for years. “You are going to have to help me help you. I said I wanted you all to get back to me with information as to things that we could do to make things better. Kind of hard to do that when you think you’re almost perfect, though -- I’m serious,” Cummings said.“We have to be frank with each other and begin to set some goals,” he added.A number of Democrats on the committee cited budget cuts while defending those testifying Wednesday, which included officials from the IRS, State Department and Treasury.Still, the panel is looking to push a FOIA reform bill to the House floor to improve the programs.

The replica of the French navy frigate Hermione which brought General Lafayette to America to rally rebels fighting Britain in the US war of independence, will set sail for the United States again, 235 years after the original crossing. L'Hermione will leave its mooring on the island of Aix in the west of France, navigate up the Charente river to the naval town of Rochefort to pay homage to its birthplace, and finally head back to Aix before heading West. AFP PHOTO / XAVIER LEOTY (Photo credit should read XAVIER LEOTY/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d98b123b00000630ec987f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Following a long winter and wet spring, summer has finally arrived in Washington, D.C., and with it come hundreds of thousands of tourists, drawn by the monuments and museums to the city designed by Frenchman Pierre l'Enfant. Many will no doubt stroll in Lafayette Park facing the front of the White House, a verdant square named for another Frenchman, the Marquis de Lafayette. He was a remarkable man to whom Americans have shown gratitude ever since he arrived on the shores of South Carolina in 1777 as a 19-year-old nobleman offering French assistance in the Revolutionary War. For the next 18 months, Lafayette commanded troops and fought valiantly in the new nation's cause, becoming friends with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.After returning to France in 1779, Lafayette advocated for even greater French help to the young America and secured the promise of 6,000 more soldiers, to be commanded by General de Rochambeau. The following year, he set sail from the port of Rochefort aboard the frigate Hermione, arriving in Newport Bay in June 1780 and later providing crucial help to the American troops in the Battle of Yorktown. It is said that when General Washington learned of Lafayette's return to America aboard the Hermione, he cried tears of joy for the return of a friend whom he considered a son, and for the message Lafayette carried promising French soldiers, munitions, and uniforms to support America's cause for independence. Today, 235 years later, the French-American relationship is as strong and vital as it was in Lafayette's day, with a magnificent replica of the Hermione about to make landfall at Yorktown, Virginia, after its six-week journey across the Atlantic. Many of those visiting Washington, D.C., will travel down to Yorktown, where, in the fall of 1781, General George Washington and allied French forces besieged General Charles Lord Cornwallis' British army, effectively ending the war and ensuring America's independence. This is an alliance of two friends who have always stood together for common values of liberty, equality and justice, even if at times we differed, as friends do, on how best to achieve them. That is why the United States was honored to repay the debt to Lafayette and the French people in World Wars I and II, when tens of thousands of Americans sacrificed their lives to liberate France. France is not only the United States' oldest ally; it is an indispensable partner in advancing international peace and security, promoting global economic prosperity, and confronting global challenges, from climate change to violent extremism. We are working side by side on issues such as the situation in Ukraine, the Iranian nuclear program, containing Ebola and fighting terrorist groups in the Middle East and Africa. Shortly after the despicable terrorist attacks in Paris in January, the White House hosted a summit on countering violent extremism in which France emphasized the need for further measures to curb the recruitment of new cadres into terrorist groups. Addressing the equally urgent issue of global climate change, Paris will host in December its own summit, the COP 21, a large conference of world leaders negotiating for further global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The United States and France are committed to working toward an ambitious, new climate agreement, recognizing the threat to national security and global stability that unrestrained carbon emissions pose. Meanwhile, the landscape of trade and cultural relations between the two countries continues to flourish. The United States is the world's leading investor in France, creating approximately 440,000 jobs, whereas France is the fifth largest investor in the United States, responsible for more than 500,000 jobs. Total trade in goods and services reached $115 billion in 2014, demonstrating that we represent both major buyers and suppliers for each other's markets. A delegation of 40 leading French companies recently attended the Select USA conference in Washington, exploring ways to expand their businesses or create partnerships with American companies. French tech companies made France the most represented of all European countries at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last January. This commerce could grow significantly if the United States and the E.U. conclude TTIP free-trade negotiations currently under discussion in Brussels and Washington. Moreover, educational and cultural exchanges continue to enrich both our societies. A huge number of students cross the Atlantic each year to study and share their research, and Washington and Paris recently announced a plan to double student exchanges between France and the U.S. by 2025. At the same time, writers, musicians, dancers, artists and digital creators display their talents to appreciative audiences in French and English. In April in Paris the Kennedy Center bestowed artistic awards to four leading French cultural figures, including the legendary composer and musician Pierre Boulez, and the New York Philharmonic performed at the new Paris Philharmonic. In Washington and New York, the world-renowned Cambini-Paris string quartet performed this spring, and last September the French government's Cultural Services opened Albertine Books in Manhattan, a new bookshop and cultural space where lively debates and colloquia regularly take place. When the reproduction of the Hermione, with its 30 canons and three huge masts, arrives in Yorktown on June 5, it will serve as a powerful and tangible reminder of the long and absolutely essential friendship France and America have enjoyed. Just as thousands of French men and women turned out to celebrate the Hermione's departure from France, including French President François Hollande, we hope many thousands of Americans will welcome her at ports from Virginia to Maine when she arrives, with the same warmth and spirit their founding fathers welcomed Lafayette and his fellow soldiers more than two centuries ago."
9,POLITICS,The U.S. Just Launched A Crime Strike Force In This Booming Oil Patch,Laura Barron-Lopez,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bakken-crime-strike-force_n_7504580.html,,2015-06-03,"WATFORD CITY, ND - JULY 28: Ray Gerish, a floor hand for Raven Drilling, works on an oil rig drilling into the Bakken shale formation on July 28, 2013 outside Watford City, North Dakota. North Dakota has been experiencing an oil boom in recent years, due in part to new drilling techniques including hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. In April 2013, The United States Geological Survey released a new study estimating the Bakken formation and surrounding oil fields could yield up to 7.4 billion barrels of oil, doubling their estimate of 2008, which was stated at 3.65 billion barrels of oil. Workers for Raven Drilling work twelve hour days fourteen days straight, staying at a camp nearby, followed by fourteen days.

Point blank: It wouldn’t be far off the mark to describe North Dakota and Montana’s Bakken oil field as the Wild West. To deal with the issue, the Justice Department formally announced its plan to dispatch an organized crime strike force to the Bakken -- which produces well over 1 million barrels of oil per day -- to tackle human trafficking, drug and weapons trafficking and white collar crimes. The region's problem with organized crime is no surprise, and the FBI, as well as other state and local law enforcement agencies, has been trying for years to rein offenders in. But the task force launched by the Justice Department on Wednesday is different. The new crime force will be aimed at “identifying, targeting and dismantling” organized crime.“The strike force will have the capability of not only dismantling local criminal organizations in the Bakken, but also to take out the national and international components of these organizations wherever they may be located,” acting U.S. attorney for North Dakota, Chris Myers, said in a statement. “The strike force will take a regional approach to a regional problem, coordinating with Montana law enforcement.”The strike force will have bases in four cities and work with designated prosecutors and agents. The Bakken formation, which spans roughly 200,000 square miles over North Dakota and Montana, reaching to Canada, has experienced a dramatic influx in population given the job opportunities to work in the oil patch.As a result, those living there have seen an increase in “serious crimes, including the importation of pure methamphetamine from Mexico and multi-million dollar fraud and environmental crimes,” the Justice Department said in a statement Wednesday.North Dakota and Montana have asked for federal help for some time as drug dealing and sex trafficking have increased in the Bakken. The oil field is a prime spot for such trades given the thousands of workers who flock to the region for grueling work that pays well. “Man camps,” which house male oil workers who have left their homes to work for months at a time in the fields, are a target for traffickers. “The Bakken’s criminal impact transcends borders and so should our law enforcement response,” said Montana U.S. Attorney Michael Cotter. “The strike force is a welcome addition to our existing multi-jurisdictional law enforcement efforts in the region.” The Justice Department's announcement offers a look at the darker side of the oil boom, which shot the U.S. to its place as the No. 1 energy producer in oil and gas in the world."

You are well within your rights to suggest how someone could rectify a situation, but by keeping your suggestions realistic, you stand a much greater chance of having your wishes fulfilled.",2015-06-03,Overworking business woman suffering from headache,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb604f62500003200397a2c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For some women, ""complain"" is a four-letter word. True, from the time we were little girls, society did its best to rid us of this nasty habit. Complaining, whining, nagging, ranting, raving -- often all are lumped together in a most unladylike fashion. Unfortunately, this is where society got it wrong. While whining, nagging, ranting and raving may not be the most productive uses of your time, complaining can be. If done efficiently, complaining can help you fight for your rights and get what you deserve. Here's how to keep your cool while doing so.1. Know why you're complaining. It may seem obvious, but before you complain, you need to know why you are about to do so. Poor customer service? Faulty goods? Low hygiene standards? Broken contract? These are all common causes of complaints, but you'll do best if you can get more specific. For example, knowing that on Oct. 23 the women's room at the chichi café where you take your clients was not only dirty, but had three stalls out of order, is a much better complaint than ""sometimes the bathroom is gross."" If you have only a vague notion of why you are unhappy or dissatisfied, refine your complaint until you feel more confident in your delivery.2. Tell it to someone who cares. Once you know what you want to say, you need to contact someone who not only cares about your issue, but has the power to do something about it. Marching into the store that just sold you a faulty laptop and haranguing the men unloading the latest shipment is not going to get you very far. Instead, find out who handles customer complaints and what the preferred procedure is for that organization. Do all that you can to get your complaint into the right hands up front and you'll feel more confident that it's getting the attention it deserves.3. Write, don't rant. When you complain, make sure you put it in writing. This not only gives you evidence of your complaint, but the process of writing about your dissatisfaction allows you the time to select your words with care and make your point without becoming emotional. Address your letter to someone specific, write with a formal tone and include all relevant facts. Keep your letter polite and succinct, and include a date by which you would like a reply. Treat your letter of complaint as a business correspondence and you can be confident that you will get a reply with the same respect.4. Remain reasonable. Staying calm is the key to getting what you want from a complaint. You are well within your rights to suggest how someone could rectify a situation, but by keeping your suggestions realistic, you stand a much greater chance of having your wishes fulfilled. For example, if you haven't received your bank statements in a few months, then writing and asking for copies at no cost is a reasonable request that could be quickly carried out. Asking for no-fee banking for life and a public apology from the bank president is not. Remember, complaints are not a way to punish others, but rather to describe a problem and find a suitable solution. Keeping these goals in mind will help you feel confident that you are approaching a matter in the most appropriate way.5. Be persistent. Complaining is not for the faint of heart. Very often, complaints are ""referred,"" ""investigated,"" ""considered,"" or otherwise ignored. Before you make your complaint, remind yourself that you may need to follow up on the matter for weeks -- or even months -- before you get any real satisfaction. Only start down this path if you are confident that you can walk it till the end. Otherwise you'll likely end up feeling even more frustrated than when you began, which will only give you something else to complain about!"

The ""Front Office Combine"" -- founded by Warren LeGarie (the Summer League's Executive Director) and Albert Hall (the Summer League's Vice President of Business Operations) -- will provide educational and immersive programs July 10-14, in the context (and at the same location) as the ever-growing Summer League season. The Combine will provide a rare and unparalleled opportunity for anyone seeking a career in professional sports, but in the particular the NBA.There are essentially four areas of entry-level positions with any front office in a professional sport franchise: Two revolve around ticket sales and sponsor sales; the third focuses on public relations and the expanding field of social media; and the fourth on scouting and analytics. The Combine will feature curriculum in all four areas, with a practicum directly related to the Summer League activities. There will also be training provided for all participants on designing an ""elevator pitch,"" networking and resume writing. ""We had seen several programs spring up around the Summer League over the years, but most of them were the typical two-day, learn-how-to-be-something programs that had little lasting value for the participants,"" said co-founder LeGarie. ""It dawned on us that there was a need for this type of program within the confines of the Summer League -- but only if done comprehensively and in a manner that really provided value to young persons with their sports employment possibilities.""In addition to LeGarie and Hall, the program boasts an all-star lineup of sports business executives as teachers and presenters, including several leading coaches and General Managers. ESPN's Sage Steele, Kirk Goldsberry and Kevin Arnovitz, the Pac-12's Rob Sine, broadcaster Mike Breen, along with executives from Turner Sports and DreamWorks will add to an already robust lineup.LeGarie and Hall are hoping that the Combine will ride the wave of the NBA's growth and expansion. ""The Summer League has become a combination laboratory/festival for the NBA,"" said LeGarie. ""In a real sense, we are providing R&D testing for the NBA across all kinds of platforms including technology and game operations. But it is also a celebratory atmosphere -- and opportunity for fans to watch the stars of the future in a fun, vibrant, up-close environment."" The Combine will now provide an exciting new dimension to the mix.""The Vegas Summer League provides one of the most target-rich environments for networking and a truly authentic behind the scenes experience,"" said the Combine's PR and Social Media Division Head Gina Antoniello, who will also be developing the PR curriculum at the five-day event.The Combine promises to be a one-of-a-kind experience. ""We want to provide learning and training in the areas most important to securing a career in sports,"" said LeGarie.Geoffrey Dunn is the author of Sports of Santa Cruz County (Arcadia Press) and has won awards for sports writing from the National Newspaper Association and the California Newspaper Publishers Association.

And while the beauty of a vacation is that you can do whatever the hell you want without judgment, there are some decisions SO poor, so woefully bereft of sense, that no good outcome could ever hope to result from them. These are 15 of those decisions.More: The 9 Weirdest Small Towns on Earth Credit: Flickr/thirtyfootscrewStaying at an all-inclusive resort Sure, unlimited food and drinks sounds pretty damn fantastic at first, but the maddening realization that you just spent a massive lump sum on bottomless rail liquor and limitless frozen pizza will take the sails out of any vacation. Unless you're opting for one of these slick resorts, do yourself a favor and skip it.  Trying to do too much It's only natural to wanna justify the cost of your vacation by cramming as many activities and sights as possible into every 24-hour period. After all, you're only gonna be in Australia once, right? Wrong. After your third day of nonstop touring, you'll be wishing you'd penciled in a day of rest at the pool. Trying to squeeze an outback walkabout and a Great Barrier Reef snorkeling session into four days is a great way to enjoy neither activity.   Being a slave to your original itinerary Even if you plan your trip out right, stubbornly sticking to your original itinerary only ensures that you'll miss out on the random opportunities that pop up. Factoring in flexibility can be just as important as giving yourself some time to relax, and it can result in some pretty awesome experiences -- like catching live music in a dive bar you just so happen to be walking past on your way to the Sagrada Familia.

Yes, you could take your chances and hope that Hurricane Denzel doesn't hit when you're relaxing on the beach, or that your tandem skydive instructor knows what he's doing, but if the defecation hits the oscillation, you're out a thousand-dollar vacation. Or a life.  Carrying your passport with you You'd be surprised how many people still leave the hotel holding the one thing that'll allow them to return to their home country safely. If you absolutely need to carry your passport for identification purposes, make a photocopy and leave the original in your hotel safe.

I had my four ginormous suitcases to keep me company, but that was about it.   Fast-forward a year and a ton of bad online dates later, and I met James. We had a really fast and exciting romance and ended up getting engaged and married within the span of 14 months.   Two gorgeous weddings later (one in the US and the UK), I still felt like something was missing. Although James made me happier than I'd ever been, I knew I was meant for more and was finally ready to start the business I'd always dreamed of creating. They say timing is everything, and it definitely was for me. My relationship gave me the foundation and stability I needed to really springboard off of and finally make my dreams of becoming an entrepreneur a reality.   So throughout our first year of marriage, James watched as I poured over idea after idea and supported me throughout every single quarter-life crisis moment and day spent throwing myself on the bed in a fit of ""confused, frustrated, and stuck"" tears. He was there for it all, and trust me, it wasn't always pretty. James was there the moment I came up with the idea for my company I Heart My Life in September 2013, and he even helped me create my first website that launched last March.   He was there when I questioned whether my first photoshoot was good enough and opened every single newsletter just to get the open-rate up when I only had mere 15 people on my list (which consisted of friends and family).He passed out my business cards, told everyone who would listen about IHML, and made me blush more times than I can count when he bragged about what I was doing.   He was there to celebrate me when I hit my company milestones like my first client, leaving my 9-5 job, and my first 6-figure month. He's been my rock and my biggest fan at the same time, and his belief in me is unwavering.   And with that, it's his turn.   Because I decided to follow my dreams and my heart, James is now able to do the same.After 12 years in the design industry, James is leaping into the entrepreneurial world with me -- something that was an enigma to him up until very recently. You see, James didn't grow up with entrepreneurs around him. And although he never showed it, there were times over the past year where he thought I was (a lot) crazy. But now he gets it, and I Heart My Life has opened his eyes to so much more: the possibility of being satisfied with his work again, feeling a sense of purpose, and of course changing lives through coaching.   To be able to work with my husband, travel together and share in this dream is, well, better than I could have ever imagined my life and business to turn out.   We have big things in store for I Heart My Life and now it's all wrapped up in one massive and united mission!   So today, I hope this story reminds you that your dreams (and things that are better than your dreams) are possible. You can have the life you've always wanted and then some if you follow your heart and take action.   If you're in search of financial freedom, the ability to work from anywhere in the world, getting fully booked and maybe even retiring your husband, it's possible!

In fact, our sanity depends on it. By the time we peel the last kid from our leg and make it out the door, we're exhausted and the night hasn't even begun. But this doesn't stop us. No way! We may be a tad disheveled but we're more than ready to make the most of our night of freedom.Here are 10 sure-fire signs that we're on a Moms' Night Out:1. We're breathless with anticipation.By the time we run the kid and husband gauntlet and sneak a few deep breaths into a paper bag you'd better watch the hell out! Sure, we arrive late and yes, we look a bit windblown but don't underestimate us. We are ready to par-tay!2. We'd like that on the rocks -- ASAP!We want a cocktail and we want it now. No hemming and hawing here. We've been dreaming of this beverage since we woke up to: ""Mom, I'm done!"" Upon first site of the waitress, we get our order in. Bam. Just like that.3. The menu means nothing to us.Sure, when it comes to our drinks, we're on it. Our menus, on the other hand, are not even on our radar. We're far too immersed in our female, adult-only conversations to take notice. Luckily, we're a group of moms so one of us soon takes control and we get some food ordered.4. A mom or two are there, in spirit only.  We often lose a few moms leading up to the night and then, on the day, we lose at least one more. Why? Because that's the nature of the game. When ""life"" happens, the mom needs to be there. And when it comes to a night out, ""life"" denies at least one mom her freedom.5. Comfy is the new cool.We aren't likely to come tittering out in a pair of sky-high stilettos. Nope, not us moms. Wedges are more our scene because, quite frankly, we like to be safe. We also like to keep our sciatic nerve issues at bay and besides, we aren't interested in losing sleep to a late night Charlie horse.6. We've perfected the 15 minute makeover.Well, ok we haven't totally perfected it but we've become accustomed to having our ""getting ready time"" hijacked by the needs of others and because of this, we've now got the messy bun down to a science and we have no qualms putting our make-up on in the car.  7. Maxi dresses are a mom's BFF.This is true mainly because they're an entire outfit all in one, which works nicely into our 15 minute makeover timeline. The fact that they are full length is ideal when we make the discovery of one hairy leg and one smooth. Plus these sexy, feminine wonders offer space and comfort in which to accommodate our chocolate cheesecake.8. There's a witch at our table. There isn't really. It's just a cackling mom (like me) with her laughing friends. We laugh and laugh and we cackle because that's how we roll. We're there to talk about our daily screw ups, sex fails and, of course, funny tales of life before marriage. We're in it for the laughs so don't sit near us if you want to hear the people you're with.9. When the clock strikes 12... we're in bed.It's true. We are pretty responsible like that. After some good chats, a careful balance of water to wine and a few dangerously satisfying yawns, we happily head home to our comfy beds. Ready for the next day.But sometimes...10. We wanna party like it's 1999!And we don't give a crap if we look cool or who the hell else is around us. We just want to cut loose to Rhythm is a Dancer and have a few more drinks. Is this too much to ask? Sadly, when the morning comes, and we wake up to: ""Mom, I'm done!"" we'll wish it was still 1999 but it won't be. And the day will be long, very, very long. We'll look like Bernie, from Weekend at Bernie's, and we'll vow, with all our might, to never feel this way again.This post first appeared on Martinis & Motherhood "

Nothing ever really begins... or ends.Today has been a bit of a land mine of emotion. My grandma turns 87, just two days after being put on hospice. The symbols of her beginning and ending being so close to one another is not lost on me.Similarly, this afternoon, my husband and I had a chance to take the kids back to our first home, almost 12 years to the day we moved in, and 8 years to the day we moved out. Again, the timing was not lost on me. It was the place where my daughter Grace spent the first two years of her life, and a house my son Michael never knew. Much of it was exactly as we had left it, down to the paint on the walls. It made me homesick, wanting to go back to those moments in my life that had passed. How easily I could put myself right back there... remembering how the boxwoods smelled as we worked in the yard... reading the Sunday paper while having breakfast in the tiny dining room... putting groceries away in the cramped, galley kitchen... seeing a toddler-sized, fluffy-haired Grace sitting on the floor of the living room watching Sesame Street with toys strewn around her...Then I turned around and saw the reality of now: this beautiful young woman with feet bigger than mine, who had no real memories at all of the house, despite the fact that I could picture her in every single corner of it. And next to her was this 6-year-old boy with kangaroo legs, sliding around on hardwood floors his chubby little baby knees never crawled on. We moved out of that house so we would have more room to bring Michael into our lives. How odd to be standing in this place with him where he never existed, if only in our dreams for the future.It almost took my breath away how quickly life had changed in a matter of 8 years... how, standing within those walls of our first home, it felt like the beginnings of our marriage and parenthood seemed like yesterday. Yet a second later, it felt like a lifetime ago as I gazed upon my kids, who didn't fit in this house at all: one because she was just too grown up to match the memory, the other because he was simply in existence. All the longing to be back in those days for even a moment vanished, for I realized my story couldn't have gone the way it was supposed to if we hadn't left that house. And leaving wasn't really an end, but a beginning of something new, something better. Moreover, I discovered how easily I could make what was over seem like it wasn't.I hope that is what is happening for my grandma right now. It is as if her dementia has her in a state a bit like the one I was in as I walked through the rooms of my old house. She is living in moments of her life that are over, moments where sometimes her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren don't even exist. Then every now and again, she is jarred into the present. Despite her failing condition, I would like to think she has points of clarity when she knows we are all here, that the way her life played out was good. Very good.

Nothing ever really begins... or ends.Today has been a bit of a land mine of emotion. My grandma turns 87, just two days after being put on hospice. The symbols of her beginning and ending being so close to one another is not lost on me.Similarly, this afternoon, my husband and I had a chance to take the kids back to our first home, almost 12 years to the day we moved in, and 8 years to the day we moved out. Again, the timing was not lost on me. It was the place where my daughter Grace spent the first two years of her life, and a house my son Michael never knew. Much of it was exactly as we had left it, down to the paint on the walls. It made me homesick, wanting to go back to those moments in my life that had passed. How easily I could put myself right back there... remembering how the boxwoods smelled as we worked in the yard... reading the Sunday paper while having breakfast in the tiny dining room... putting groceries away in the cramped, galley kitchen... seeing a toddler-sized, fluffy-haired Grace sitting on the floor of the living room watching Sesame Street with toys strewn around her...Then I turned around and saw the reality of now: this beautiful young woman with feet bigger than mine, who had no real memories at all of the house, despite the fact that I could picture her in every single corner of it. And next to her was this 6-year-old boy with kangaroo legs, sliding around on hardwood floors his chubby little baby knees never crawled on. We moved out of that house so we would have more room to bring Michael into our lives. How odd to be standing in this place with him where he never existed, if only in our dreams for the future.It almost took my breath away how quickly life had changed in a matter of 8 years... how, standing within those walls of our first home, it felt like the beginnings of our marriage and parenthood seemed like yesterday. Yet a second later, it felt like a lifetime ago as I gazed upon my kids, who didn't fit in this house at all: one because she was just too grown up to match the memory, the other because he was simply in existence. All the longing to be back in those days for even a moment vanished, for I realized my story couldn't have gone the way it was supposed to if we hadn't left that house. And leaving wasn't really an end, but a beginning of something new, something better. Moreover, I discovered how easily I could make what was over seem like it wasn't.I hope that is what is happening for my grandma right now. It is as if her dementia has her in a state a bit like the one I was in as I walked through the rooms of my old house. She is living in moments of her life that are over, moments where sometimes her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren don't even exist. Then every now and again, she is jarred into the present. Despite her failing condition, I would like to think she has points of clarity when she knows we are all here, that the way her life played out was good. Very good. And just as my husband and I will one day have to leave the house we live in now, the one that will always be known as the place where we raised our family, my grandma is facing another move... her final move.I believe within the deepest chambers of my heart she will be moving on to a place where she doesn't ever have to nostalgically wish to live in a moment that has passed, or feel as if life is being lived too quickly.

19,POLITICS,Should Politics Have a Voice in the Eurovision Song Contest?,"Tinatin Japaridze, ContributorArtist, Composer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/should-politics-have-a-vo_b_7485222.html,Many observers of this year's Eurovision Song Contest noted that it was the most emotionally and politically charged event in the festival's 60-year memory.,2015-06-02,2015-06-01-1433173582-5577573-SwedenMansZelmerlowWinseurovision2015.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-01-1433173582-5577573-SwedenMansZelmerlowWinseurovision2015-thumb.jpg,"Many observers of this year's Eurovision Song Contest noted that it was the most emotionally and politically charged event in the festival's 60-year memory. While Russia's Polina Gagarina had seemed like the likely winner during much of the broadcast, her entry ""A Million Voices,"" preaching peace and unity against a contrasting and deeply unsettling political climate, was met with skepticism and raised eyebrows.The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the official operator of the ESC, has long adopted a law that bans songs of protest and propaganda from Eurovision. But this has not stopped artists and songwriters from using the contest as a platform for their country's political messages.Georgia also used this year's competition to make a statement. But unlike the Russian representative who urged the nations to unite in peace and harmony, the Russian-born, Georgian-bred participant, Nina Sublatti, co-wrote her entry ""Warrior"" about the struggles of a ""Georgian woman who is a warrior underneath her delicate nature."" In contrast with the Russian competitor's ""airy"" and uplifting performance, Sublatti's image--as well as her delivery and the overall message of the song--were visually and vocally dark, heavy and gothic.Despite the peaceful message of the Russian performance--and the fact that the anti-booing technology had reportedly been installed in the stadium in Vienna--the live audience could be heard booing during the voting process whenever a country awarded points to Russia. This prompted a gentle but stern reminder by one of the hosts that ""music should stand over politics.""Ultimately, both the Georgian and Russian entries--though entirely different, almost to the point of deliberately contradicting each country's messages and political positions--were political in content and delivery. But where does this leave what was meant to be at the core of the song contest--the music and culture of a given nation?Inspired by the popular Italian Sanremo Festival, the Eurovision Song Contest (originally titled The Eurovision Grand Prix) first began in 1956 in the aftermath of World War II as a cultural move towards European unity and peace. While the contest has acquired a reputation in the Western music industry as a kitsch entertainment show with little musical value, it has provided a unique global stage on which European states--and small ones in particular--can make their voices heard.When it first opened in 1956, much of Europe was still miserable, exhausted and broke from World War II, but the ESC was not meant to reflect that world. On the contrary, the goal of its inception was to distract war-torn nations and introduce peace and harmony through music. But even this seemingly apolitical approach of promoting a peaceful inter-national dialogue echoes a political intent. The very instinct of creating Eurovision to heal the wounds of war-torn European civilians can itself be seen as a political agenda that stemmed from (and thus reflected) the political and social realities of the aftermath of World War II to assuage Europe's suffering.Entirely banning the act of political expression at a song contest would mean banning freedom of speech, and therefore contradicting the very intent of the Eurovision Song Contest to grant a voice to every European nation. However, the drawback to offering a carte-blanche to contestants without advanced screening of content leaves the European audience at risk of tuning in for an evening full of protest songs. This would likely alienate the core audience of the popular TV show, as the entertainment factor would swiftly be replaced by a political component, which, in turn, could result in the contest becoming entirely meaningless.Contrary to the perception of the majority of East European countries--no less the two neighbors and former political allies, Georgia and Russia--Eurovision is not a musical Op-Ed that invites participants to promote their political agendas. Unfortunately, playing politics no longer appears to be left exclusively to politicians, but has instead evolved into an integral part of daily life, and even entertainment. It is doubtful that Eurovision has the choice whether to be or not to be political. If the ESC does, indeed, mirror the current European cultural climate, it is then likely to reflect the sociopolitical and economic tensions of the outside world, unable to escape the influence of the political realities of each participating nation.This analysis was originally published by the Center on Global Interests."

They don't know how easy they have it. When mine grumble about ""doing research"" for a school assignment, I roll my eyes and launch into a speech about the days B.G. (Before Google). Back then, I tell them, ""doing research"" required riding our bikes to the library, shuffling through a card catalogue (this takes some explaining), navigating rows and rows of books and then actually reading one or two of them. What used to take a week or more can now be accomplished in a few moments.Unfortunately, I think the awesomeness of this technological superpower is lost on most graduates today, and who can blame them? In his book, Here Comes Everybody (2009), author Clay Shirky prophesizes about a day when digital technology becomes so ubiquitous that it becomes invisible. I think that day is here. So unless we tell kids they have superpowers at their fingertips, they might just graduate into a digital world that never capitalizes on its true potential.I spend a lot of time teaching students about online safety, reputation management, cyberbullying, privacy and all that a jazz. Of course I hope that when they graduate they will remember every lesson, but frankly, I'd be satisfied if they remembered just the last one. This lesson sends them forth with these final reminders on how to deploy their online superpowers: 1. Post Thoughtfully. Be the best version of yourself online. Remember to only post things you won't mind the whole world seeing today and in 10 years. Or even 20. Think before you hit ""send,"" and maybe even ask yourself, ""Does the world really need another selfie?""2. Use Your Voice. Today's technology renders every voice equal. This means whether you are a 100-year-old publishing conglomerate or an 18-year-old shrinking violet with a wifi connection, you have the power to reach vast audiences. So, use your voice to move mountains, end world hunger or to stop genocide. Things that will make the world a better place or that simply put someone having a bad day in a better place.3. Keep Learning. Create an online network of people and organizations that constantly connect you to new things, new ideas and new possibilities. Things that will make you an improved version of yourself. Don't waste precious time on cyber-gossip or online trolls, or another cat video (OK, maybe we can make an exception on that last one). Remember, life is short. Spend it learning about and sharing something exciting or wonderful every day; you'll be amazed at the people you'll meet. Plus, your personal learning network will grow in the process.4. Build Your Digital Resume. Whether you're graduating from middle school, high school or college, you will be judged, hired and befriended by your digital resume. So, keep an eye on it by doing a Google search of your name regularly and addressing any problems before they get out of hand. Maybe even blog about your interests or hobbies (it's free on Blogger.com). Consider buying online real estate (get a custom domain, a.k.a. a URL, of your name). Work on your online presence like you work on your baseball swing or your tan. It's an investment that will keep on growing. 5. Be Kind. Remember, the online world is populated by real people with real feelings (just listen to Monica Lewinsky's moving TED talk on this topic). So please be kind. 6. Be Like Superman. And finally, be like Peter Parker in Superman who says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.'"""
21,POLITICS,Adam Smith vs. Ayn Rand,"David Morris, ContributorDirector, The Public Good Initiative, Institute for Local Self...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adam-smith-vs-ayn-rand_b_7482620.html,"Even with Medicare and Medicaid, tens of millions of Americans lack access to adequate medical care. Many millions have been plunged into bankruptcy because of medical expenses. Obamacare was established to deal with these stark facts. The case of Luis Lang demonstrates that Obamacare is only a step in the right direction.",2015-06-02,2015-06-01-1433153444-3901476-aynrandandadamsmith.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-01-1433153444-3901476-aynrandandadamsmith-thumb.jpg," In a 2011 CNN/Tea Party Express Republican Debate moderator Wolf Blitzer famously asked prominent libertarian Representative Ron Paul a ""hypothetical question"" about the soon-to-be-operational Obamacare: What should be done when a 30-year old man decides not to buy health insurance and then requires significant medical intervention that he cannot afford? Paul predictably responded. He should ""assume responsibility for himself...That's what freedom is all about, taking your own risks...""Blitzer followed up by asking Paul if he meant, ""society should just let him die?"" Members of the audience yelled, ""Yeah"". It was a Tea Party meeting after all. Paul waffled. He conceded intervention might be necessary but insisted the cost should be borne voluntarily by ""(o)ur neighbors, our friends, our churches.""Now Obamacare is in place. The hypothetical has become real. In the last few weeks we've learned of at least two Republicans who refused to buy health insurance and then launched GoFundMe initiatives when they encountered medical difficulties.In November 2014 self-employed Richard Mack's wife was hospitalized and then in early January he himself suffered a heart attack. His son launched a GoFundMe campaign. ""It is difficult and humbling to say that we need your help but we do."" He's raised $45,000 so far toward a $60,000 goal from a little over 1,000 donors.Mack's opposition to Obamacare is political. A former sheriff of Graham County, Arizona he is the founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, a group he described as ""the army to set our nation free"". He serves on the board of Oath Keepers, a right-wing group made up of police and military veterans. He's been an outspoken opponent not only of the American Care Act (ACA) but of all federal authority. ""The States do not have to take or support or pay for Obamacare or anything else from Washington, DC,"" says Mack. ""The States are not subject to federal direction.""More widely reported is the case of Luis Lang, a 49-year-old self-employed resident of Fort Mill, South Carolina who always prided himself on paying his own medical expenses. He suffered a series of mini strokes earlier this year and ended up with bleeding in the eyes, a partially detached retina and a need for very expensive medical care to save his eyesight. He's been out of work since December. His GoFundMe campaign has raised $26,000 toward a $30,000 goal from over 1300 donors.Ron Paul might view Richard Mack's situation as a perfect example of his libertarian philosophy. He chose not to buy insurance. He now needs financial assistance. His family and friends have rallied to his support, largely because of his political activities. One donor wrote, ""Thank you for your sacrifice in the fight for our freedom."" Another said, ""Keep up the fight and with the full armour (sic) of God we will prevail. Thanks be to God for your stand for freedom and for not giving in to the Obama care demands."" Another commented, ""May God continue to watch over you and bless all that you do for this nation under siege."" And another declared, ""Thanks for never surrendering to federal tyranny.""To me, however, Lang's case is more instructive. Lang is not a public figure. He's not a political rallying point. Moreover, his is a case study in personal irresponsibility. He is a long time smoker who has been lax in controlling his diabetes. He knew that his eyes needed serious medical attention for some time.When the Charlotte Observer first wrote about Lang he was angry at Obamacare. When confronted with significant medical expenses he tried to sign up but discovered enrollment had closed a month earlier. He is now poor enough to qualify for Medicaid but South Carolina's Republican controlled legislature has refused to expand Medicaid. Nevertheless, his wife Mary said, ""(My husband) should be at the front of the line, because he doesn't work and because he has medical issues.""Lang was asking for help primarily from strangers who didn't know who he was. Revealingly, a significant majority of those who gave were self-described liberals, according to Charles Gaba. One donor wrote, ""The party of personal responsibility (has) left you hanging on your own consequences. Progressives like me think that's just cruel."" Another disclosed, ""From a first generation immigrant Communist. Good luck brother."" Another reflected, ""From a godless liberal feminist but my 89 y/o dad has macular degeneration and so my heart goes out to anyone who's having vision trouble."" Still another pointed out, ""Sir, I know if the shoe was on the other food you would expect me to 'pull myself up by my own boot straps"" and wouldn't contribute. But I'm compassionate and think we all owe something to each other."" Another commented, ""I want to say something clever and sassy about your right wing stupidity, but all I can feel is compassion. I hope you get the medical care you need."" And still another observed, ""I too am a bleeping liberal who thinks no one should suffer due to bad choices, bad luck, or bad policies of conservative dogma.""After reviewing the comments, Lang reflected on his GoFundMe page, ""I have to give a big thumbs up to the liberal side. Even though you have crucified me in your comments but you spoke with your heart with donations...As far as the conservative side I wish they would step up to the plate and do there (sic) part.""Which brings us to the crux of the debate about Obamacare or any government sponsored health insurance. Conservatives, circa 2015 do not believe it is their obligation to help. Lang made his choice and he must live with the consequences. The modern day conservative's guru is Ayn Rand, who viewed compassion as inherently dehumanizing, an emotion that, if acted upon, diminishes the self. ""Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others..."" she declared. ""The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute, is self-sacrifice--which means; self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial, self-destruction....""In Ayn Rand's world, I am most definitely not my neighbor's keeper. Republicans political leaders in the 21 states that have refused to expand Medicaid despite the fact that it would cost the state virtually nothing to do so are clearly of that mindset.I'm sure these Republicans would declare their allegiance to Adam Smith as fervently as they do to Ayn Rand. But there's the rub. Adam Smith believed in altruism and compassion. Indeed, in his book The Theory of Moral Sentiments Smith argued that humans' innate sense of empathy and sympathy forms the basis for civilized life. ""The man whom we naturally love the most is he who joins to...his own original and selfish feelings, the most exquisite sensibility...and sympathetic feels of others."" Smith wrote The Theory of Moral Sentiments before the The Wealth of Nations. It became an instant best seller. Both should be read together. The flip side of economic self-interest is the interest in the greater good. Without compassion the brutality of the marketplace becomes unconscionable.The comments on Lang's GoFundMe page may have changed his own politics. In an interview with ThinkProgress he exclaimed, ""Now that I'm looking at what each party represents, my wife and I are both saying -- hey, we're not Republicans!"" He added, ""... I do mainly blame Republicans for their pigheadedness. They're blocking policies that could help everyone. I'm in the situation I'm in because they chose not to expand Medicaid for political reasons. And I know I'm not the only one.""Luis Lang's views on medical care have changed dramatically. He now favors a health care system that enables everyone to have coverage regardless of their income level. No more means testing. No more enrollment periods. No more mountains of paperwork and bureaucracies. Lang says he now agrees ""one hundred percent"" with the people who commented on his crowdfunding page that health care is a human right.Richard Mack and Luis Lang are individuals seeking the help of individuals. They may succeed in their campaigns. But if 1 million or even 1 thousand individuals tried to create GoFundMe campaigns to deal with elevated medical expenses they would inevitably come up short no matter how many compassionate people are out there. Individual charity cannot sustain such a level of collective need.Which is why we have Medicare and Medicaid and the VA. Yet even with these tens of millions of Americans lack access to adequate medical care. Many millions have been plunged into bankruptcy because of medical expenses.Obamacare was established to deal with these stark facts. The case of Luis Lang demonstrates that Obamacare is only a step in the right direction. Ultimately, as Mr. Lang now understands, we need to view adequate health care as a human right, available to all. Virtually every industrialized nation already does. Those countries also value individual responsibility. But they do not believe that when it comes to health, irresponsibility should condemn one to death or penury. They accept that access to medical care is a social obligation. And so should we."

As a divorced, single, gay, and then coupled dad who now lives in an empty nest, I embrace the evolving cultural acceptance of any kind of family. All families.But let's not talk about that here... let's talk about changing parenting styles.I don't ""parent"" like my parents did. Yes, it's a verb! And I don't think I parent like anything from a textbook either. I do it my way with all of the good, the bad, and the ugly. And I'm not alone in this behavior as we are now starting to see that reflected in pop culture as well, not just in movies and television but also brand marketing.Last year's HelloFlo ""First Moon Party"" is a great example. I never saw a mom like that when I was growing up!HelloFlo is representative of a modern parenting style that doesn't make your child your best friend, or your peer either, but is about relating to her on a bit of a equal level. It's an ""I've been there"" so let me help you ""not take this all quite so seriously"" approach. There's also a little ""you can't fool me because I know what's really going on"" attitude as well.I love the irreverence; the one-to-one relationship yet ""I'm still the boss feel"" to it all.I am that way with my children too... they know I'm the dad but I try to interact with them on an equal level. We have open and honest conversations together, and sometimes there's some sarcasm thrown in the mix.There's also a new piece of marketing from Volkswagen that has a similar tonality in that ""I know what's really going on"" and ""let me do what I can to help"" parenting approach.In the Volkswagen video, the dad is witnessing the struggles of teen life, and actively lends a hand... for his daughter and her prom date. Now back in my day, dads were the ones to be afraid of but clearly in modern parenting this dad is right along side his daughter, guiding her every step of the way in her emotional development.I like that style.Which is why I also totally relate to a new Whirlpool video titled ""Dad and Andy"" that shows the wonderful nurturing side of parenting, again surprisingly coming from a dad of all places!We have seen dads rise in stature in brand marketing the last year or so, and this Whirlpool spot is a perfect example.Gone is the bumbly-fumbly, aloof, career-obsessed fool that we once thought of about dad. He's the active caregiver, not just for the photo ops but also for every day life.Yes, families have changed, gender roles have merged, and our parenting styles have evolved. We are a mashup of every cultural nuance that now exists and thrives...and we are raising what I hope will be the greatest generation this world has ever seen as a result.And I'm hoping that my two young adult children are shining examples of that...as I hope yours are too."

Last year, I started attending service at a local Baptist church. I was hired to paint abstract paintings during the praise portion of the church's Easter Sunday Service. During the dress rehearsal, the day before, I was moved to tears. ""We know you love us,"" the large man, one of the praise singers, said on stage, looking up, pointing his finger with a humble conviction towards the sky. ""We know we're loved,"" he said. These words, combined with the sweet, sentimental music playing in the background, hit me like a ton of bricks. The words went straight to my heart. A wave of emotion moved over me as I stood with the director of operations for the church (I'm usually comfortable crying in public) and I thought, ""I can't cry here. I don't even know this woman!"" Needless to say, I left the rehearsal affected. After attending the Easter Sunday Service the next day, I decided to attend regular services at the church. I was raised Catholic, you see, and I never quite connected with that religion, nor the messages and ways they did things in the church. But, ironically, last spring, before I was asked to do this Easter gig, a major shift occurred in my life. One day I opened up during contemplation in my apartment, and I ""received Jesus"" back into my life. Now, I put quotation marks around those words because I don't always take Jesus and the stories people tell about him so literally. (I know, I know, I can hear all of the protests. That's a debate for another time.) To me, Jesus can represent many things, and in this sense, Jesus is a representation of love.As I began attending the Sunday services, I was amazed by how moving the energy of ""the spirit"" was. Preacher always said, ""Come for a word,"" so that is what I did.At the end of the church's services, the preacher or other pastors or deacons call people up to the altar who would like to join the church, receive Jesus into their lives again, or gain some form of healing and clarity about a challenging situation they are experiencing. I've approached the altar at the end of many services, but I've often questioned myself, especially when I've felt called to go up to let Jesus back into my heart again. ""But, I've already come up here,"" I've protested to myself. ""Why do I keep feeling called to come up again?"" Even after officially joining the church earlier this year, I've still felt myself called to go up there when the preacher would ask those to come forward who wanted to join the church. This morning, I arrived to church pretty late. (It's tough for me to get there on time on a Sunday morning.) A different pastor was preaching today and he began to talk about fear. In that moment, I realized that I still have a lot of fear in my heart over things that I don't think I need to be afraid of anymore. Upon hearing those words, I asked ""God"" to remove this fear from me.When the preacher finished, he left the stage and a woman in blue walked up with a big gold cross around her neck. She began asking those who wanted to let Jesus back into their lives to come up to the stage. Standing already, at this moment, I instantly felt ""the energy,"" I call it, move me to walk up to the stage, but I resisted. ""Why?"" I said to myself as fear kicked in again. ""But why do I have to go up there again?"" I wondered. Let me give you some background on ""the energy."" Over the past several years, I have begun a journey of learning to trust the ""inner guidance"" I receive on a moment to moment basis in my life. I hear promptings inside myself of where to go, what to do, what to say, and to whom. So I do my best to have the courage to follow this. And, yes, sometimes I resist it because I'm afraid it could be embarrassing making odd requests to people, saying things to complete strangers that may be quite personal, asking that guy for his number, hugging and leaning against that tree, etc., etc. So, I hold back at times.And today was no different. I felt the prompting, literally as if someone were moving my body, from my hip area, to walk up to the front of the stage.I sat down. I checked in with myself: ""Do I really need to go up there?"" I asked myself. I felt ""the energy"" again. At first that impulse to go to the stage seemed to disappear. Then I could feel it again, ""No, ok, it wants me to go up there,"" I reckoned. ""O.K.,"" I said to myself and ""the energy."" I gathered my things and walked down the row and up the aisle towards the front of the church.In the meantime, the woman in blue stood there patiently and persistently asking, with complete courage and conviction, for anyone to come up who was ready to receive God into their lives. As I approached the front of the church, I could see one lone woman standing there at the stage with her hands raised to the sky. ""Oh, boy, I have to go up there in front of all these people?"" I say to myself.As I got up to the front of the church, I saw two people blocking my path to walk further. Relieved I didn't have to walk all the way up to the front, I decide that was far enough, and I contentedly stood behind them. But, no, much to my chagrin, I heard a woman's voice behind me say, ""Go on, get up there. Don't let anybody stop you from walking."" I felt her hand guide me firmly and encouragingly on my back as I walked in between the two people in front of me and further up towards the front. (A little girl in gold and I nearly tripped on each other. She was running alongside me as I walked further towards the stage.)""Oh boy, here we go,"" I thought to myself as I walked up closer.As I approached the side of the stage, I stopped. ""I'll just stand here,"" I thought, "" I don't need to go any further. I've done this before, I've joined the church, I've let ""Jesus"" into my heart again. Maybe I'm just here to support this other woman whose walked up,"" I thought to myself. But, no. This time a lovely, friendly looking woman in an orange melon colored button down walked over to me and said something like, ""Come on,"" as she gently put one hand on my back and held my other hand in hers, ""I'll walk with you the rest of the way."" OK, by this time, I've realized, I'm in for it. I didn't know what was going to happen, but I just hoped I didn't make a fool out of myself! ""Why am I up here?"" I really started to wonder. But, I was being swooped into it all. It was out of my control now. In the meantime, the woman in blue, on stage, with the gold cross, started saying this prayer about letting Jesus into our hearts and believing that he died for us and all of that. I recited the prayer because I thought that's what I should have been doing, even though I knew I didn't totally believe in the words of the prayer, and ""Then,"" I think, ""I can get out of this!"" But, no, after she prayed with the other lone woman, she set her eyes on me. ""Oh, there is another woman who's come up to the stage,"" she said as she walked over to me standing there, alone. The woman in orange had stepped away. ""Did you recite the prayer?"" she asked me on the mic. ""Yes,"" I replied.""Do you believe it?"" she asked.""Not totally, I think that's why I keep coming up here,"" I said to her (hoping the other parishioners would hear me and not think I'm crazy for walking up there all the time. I mean, I've never belonged to a Baptist church before. I don't know how they do things around here!). She started speaking more words and I'm just tearing up at this point. I didn't realize it in the moment, but I felt totally vulnerable, exposed, as if I'm was someone who'd just come out of hiding. I was there, in front of everyone (I don't even know most of these people), and I was seen. ""This fear, this doubt, it will never get in your way again,"" she said to me.Tears start sliding down my face. ""Will those singers on stage, some of whom are the same ones from that Easter Sunday Service last year, think I'm weird or dumb?"" I thought to myself. And, ""I don't even know why I'm crying, but something touches me in the definitiveness of what she's saying."" She was no bull shit, she was looking me right in the eye, she was saying this and believed in it and was doing all of this in front of all these people too. ""What is going on here?"" I wonder to myself. ""OK,"" she said in a deep and meaningful voice, "" with these tears coming down your face and all, will you repeat these words with me right now?"" I nodded my head and said, ""Yes,"" in a quiet and humble voice.""Raise your hands up,"" she said as she asks for someone to hold my coat. I put my hands up in the air. ""Higher,"" she said, ""so we can all see them!"" I raised them up as high as I could. She began to pray with me. She said the words and I repeated them. I thought this was going to be the same prayer she had just said before, but it was different somehow, as if it was tailor made for me. Suddenly, I wasn't speaking anymore. I couldn't speak actually. Something she said about believing she repeated a second time, and that second time I couldn't even repeat the words. Something, some energy welled up in my chest and out of my mouth came not words. My hands flew up to my face and suddenly I was sobbing. She pulled me to her chest and hugged me, holding me as she spoke to the congregation. ""When someone breaks down like this it's because they've let the Lord in,"" she said with conviction, when what seemed like the entire congregation went into an uproar, cheering and shouting behind me, praising Jesus, the Lord, as I was totally exposed, crying, like a newborn baby, in front of everyone. After the crying subsided, she looked at me again and proclaimed, ""From this day forward your heart is forever changed! I smiled softly as I felt more emotion well up inside of me. She thanked the congregation and asked them to support me. After the service ended, I turned around and the woman, who held my jacket, handed it to me. As I walked to the car, a few fellow parishioners stopped to hug me or share their support. Although I felt and knew that I had some more crying to do, grieving my past relationship with what ""God"" and ""Jesus Christ"" was for me in my younger years, I moved away from that experience changed. What will change or how I don't know, but what I can tell you is the difference in what I feel in the center of my chest right now. Where there once was a sensation of something blocking my heart, there now is the feeling of an open, clear space that is full of a golden, white light, that I can see with my minds eye. ""What's possible now?"" I ask myself. And what I ask you is:What are you afraid of?What blocks do you have around being seen, being loved, being heard?What will be the key that opens your heart to the golden light of pure essence, of love, of ""God?""With more love today, Sarah HaykelSarahHaykel.com"

We empty our wallets for hair appointments, self-help seminars, designer handbags and dream cars. We go to outlandish lengths for a simple brush to our egos. When you think about it, though, the motivating factor behind all of those endeavors is the desire for an aspect of one's life to be better. But, what if the answer is much simpler than you ever imagined? What if the magic lies in channeling the love that exists inside of you to impact another person's life in a beautiful way?What You Convey Is More Than What You Say...My grandfather was 92 years old when he peacefully released his final breath in his hospital bed last July. His state of passing was somewhat of a metaphor for the way he lived his life, for he departed from this world in the same peaceful fashion he had chosen to live in it. He lived a full life of highs and lows, tragedy and triumph. He was a quiet man of few words who communicated his values by means of his actions. He taught not by instruction, but by living. He never had to tell me he was happy to see me, for I knew it with the same level of certainty that I know my hands are currently moving across my keyboard, crafting this message for all who will read it. I knew it by the careful way he once ventured to the upper level of his home, despite his bad knees, just to make sure it was up to par for my stay.His genuine smile comforted my heart during the darkest of days. He was a master of consistency. There was never a time I called my grandfather when I was not met with a tone that conveyed both warmth and gratitude. Our conversations always began with, ""Oh, hey Lacey!"" and ended with, ""I appreciate you calling, baby."" He never had to thank me, though. One of the most meaningful lessons I take from my relationship with him is quite simple: My grandfather made me feel important, and people never forget how you make them feel.""Nobody Ever Asks Me My Name...""Once I met a homeless man named Frank. While stopped at a traffic light in a fairly busy intersection, I purchased a newspaper from him. Rather than just flash a brief smile and accept the paper in exchange for my quarter, as I had always done prior, I shook his hand, introduced myself and asked him his name. He chuckled with surprise and delight as he replied, ""Nobody ever asks me my name.""We have a responsibility to each of our fellow human beings: We must understand that each of our lives are relevant, each exist without chance and each deserve the recognition of importance. We must stop ranking human beings. We must stop compartmentalizing one another, attempting to trump one another and creating distance between ourselves and others. There is transformative healing power in the process of making another person feel wonderful. In this world, ego tells us to fight to dim the light of others in order to make our light appear brighter, but such efforts are as counterproductive as they are ridiculous. It is not necessary to take anything from another person in order to gain something for yourself.Shine Your Light On Others & Be Illuminated By It, TooUpon returning from a medical mission trip to the third world country of Belize a few years ago, I found myself with moments of feeling both breathless and speechless. I had never encountered such raw, unadulterated love and gratitude. The experience was so transformative, I wondered how I could ever justifiably articulate it to anyone. People were grateful for the simplest things, and I had never encountered such beauty.I witnessed a middle-aged man cry upon receiving treatment for an eye infection after having experienced years of discomfort. The man with the eye infection is only one example of countless touching moments, however I noticed one surprising common denominator throughout our week of treating various conditions: More than the relief from their pain or ailment, each person treated seemed most healed by one simple thing: We had taken time out of our lives to make them important.When I returned from my trip, I felt I was chasing the words to convey the healing that had taken place inside of me. By giving of myself and making the healing of others important, I healed as well. Shining light over their lives did not take any from mine. Rather, I was illuminated by it, too.The next time you consider shining light into another's life, don't just say the words. Don't just donate the money. Don't just put in the time. Don't just drive past them and pretend they don't exist. Ignorance is not bliss. Stop raising the bar of competition and begin raising the bar for true connection.Haven't you ever noticed how the takers in the world never seem to function with a full cup? You know the ones who take up hours of your time but never devote any of their time to you and who seek attention for their efforts and endeavors but never support another's shining moment without attempting to glorify themselves in the process?Their well is most often as dry as a bone, never seeming to remain full for long. What they do not understand is their self-centeredness locks them into a hollow state of isolation. They are always running on empty again before long, seeking to take more from others. On the contrary, have you ever noticed how those who give freely and lovingly without expectation are able to to do so because their cup is always overflowing?Everyone wants to leave their mark on this world and to leave a piece of themselves behind so that they live on long after they have died. The most guaranteed method of impacting another person is to make them feel that the truest part of them is valuable to you. Do this, and your mark will remain stitched on their heart forever.The original and extended version of this article can be read on The Daily Doll."

Is there a softer side that only some people can see?Not usually. Here are the real reasons that a cruel leader seems to get all the love:Fear By all appearances, the department seems to be running smoothly. Everyone appears to be getting along just fine and doing their work, but it is just a cover. His employees are afraid to challenge him, and so they keep their true feelings to themselves. This fear causes them to keep their heads down and not make any waves.No complaints No one is complaining, so everything appears to be okay. However, the absence of friendly gossip indicates that something is amiss. Co-workers are not confiding in each other because they know he will somehow find out, and then what? This fear of unknown consequences forces employees to keep the abusive behavior to themselves.Work happens His department works and just gets by because they have learned that bad things happen when they miss the mark. They are afraid to fail -- knowing from experience that they will be singled out and shamed for falling short of their goals.The respect that cruel leaders seem to earn is only an illusion.Cruel leaders do not really get all the love. It only appears that way. Under the surface, they are despised by everyone.Cruel leaders inspire hatred, not love, precisely because they are completely focused on themselves and use others to get what they want.

26,QUEER VOICES,Sir Ian McKellen Says Coming Out Made Him A Better Actor,Marcos Saldivar,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ian-mckellen-trevor-project_n_7484700.html,,2015-06-02,"British actor Sir Ian McKellen poses for photographers during a photocall of the film 'Mr Holmes' presented in the competition of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival Berlinale in Berlin, on February 8, 2015. AFP PHOTO / JOHN MACDOUGALL (Photo credit should read JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafdcb91f00002501231f9c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"June marks Pride Month for the LGBTQ community. It's a time for us to come together to celebrate the triumphs we've achieved in our fight for equality. And while our victories have been many -- especially in recent years -- we must not forget the struggles that we continue to face and the LGBTQ heroes who have paved an easier path for us. HuffPost Gay Voices recently caught up with one of those heroes -- Sir Ian McKellen. McKellen is being honored with the Trevor Project's Trevor Hero Award on June 15 and will be one of the four Grand Marshals at New York City's Pride celebration on Sunday, June 28. During our recent chat, he discussed what we should call him (""Call me Ian as long as you're kneeling down""), his own personal coming out story, his advice to LGBTQ youth and more.You have such a fascinating trajectory as an actor and as an activist for the LGBTQ community. What does being honored with the  Trevor Hero Award mean to you?  I couldn't be happier. It's lovely, lovely, lovely. There are two approaches when it comes to gay rights and the position of gay people in society. One is at the State. You have to make sure that the State does not discriminate -- that means you have to get the laws right. And the other, which is probably the easier of the two, is to make sure that everybody obeys the law and doesn't discriminate.The Trevor Project is awfully concerned with the law, but is also particularly concerned with individuals and their unique positions. The work that they do is regrettably necessary, but they have a wonderful success rate. I'm a great supporter. I've known about them for years through James Lecesne, who wrote the short film ""Trevor"".You cofounded Stonewall UK to lobby for legal and social equality for gay people. Tell us about some of their biggest success stories.  [Back then] there was no equal age of consent [to have sex]. It was 21 for gay people. Nobody worried about the lesbians -- they could just get on with it! It was 16 for straight people. Now it's 16 for everybody. Gays could not serve [openly] in the military. That's now gone. There was a very nasty law called Section 28, which inhibited teaching about homosexuality in schools. That's what got me out. That's what got me involved. Well, that law is gone. It is now, ironically, illegal to discriminate against gay people in schools -- a total reversal of Section 28! We now have civil partnerships for gay couples if they want or they can get married if they choose. Stonewall has been a prime mover in all those improvements. I wouldn't pick one as more important than the others. They've all been part of the same move towards equality: treating all citizens, regardless of their sexuality, under the law the same.The Trevor Project helps a lot of our LGBTQ youth, many of whom are often in remote areas of the country, by providing them with an outlet that they otherwise wouldn't have. To this end, what are your thoughts on the importance of celebrities coming out?  Of course, the importance of coming out is personal. The importance of coming out is that you're out yourself and your life is changed, I think, for the better. That affects those who love you -- your friends, your family, people you work with. I would never say to a celebrity, ""Come out for the good of society."" You must come out for the good of yourself. The rest will follow. Nor does it mean that if you do come out, you have to immediately start talking about gay issues as if you were an expert.I'm patron of an organization called The Albert Kennedy Trust, in memory of a man who 25 years ago came out to his family and was thrown out of the family home and eventually died at a young age. There are still young people being thrown out by their families because of old prejudices. The Albert Kennedy Trust cares for those people and mentors them and, in some cases, fosters them.There are a lot of lonely people all over the world, even in countries where the law does not discriminate against them. No one should be forced to talk about being gay and about these issues, but I think when you come out, you're likely to be politicized, which really only means that you'll make connections. You'll realize that you're own experience can be relevant to people even in far distant lands whose cultures are quite different. The experience of coming out is an experience that all gay people share. You've said before about coming out: ""When people are worrying about coming out, they're worried about what other people will think, they're worried about whether they'll lose the love of their family."" Were you ever scared to come out?  It was a different time. My mother died when I was 12 and I didn't get a chance to talk to her about it. But, there really wouldn't have been anything to talk about. We didn't have the language to talk about it. No one in England talked about being gay when I was growing up -- the word hadn't been invented. ""Queer"" was the word that was used about us. It was against the law to have sex with another man. If we were to express ourselves, we would define ourselves as being criminal. So, of course, you didn't talk about it.My coming out was to eventually tell my step mother. I gave her a bit of news that she said she had known ever since she'd met me! But, I didn't feel the oppression of the closet because it didn't apply. Nobody in theater worried about your sexuality, they just cared if you're any good at the job. When I did finally come out, when I did finally tell my step mother and sister and my aunt and my nephew, nobody gave a damn!And with the media, it was like a millstone that I didn't know had been around my neck and that fell off. And what happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor. I think up to that point, I had been using acting as a disguise -- somewhere where I could express my emotions, and draw attention to myself in a way that I didn't particularly want to do in real life. Acting became not about disguise, but about telling the truth. And my emotions became much freer. I was able to act better as I think you are able to do any job. Everyone's better if they're being honest. I like that you say that acting became about ""telling the truth."" You said something that resonated with me deeply: ""When you come out, you change -- utterly. You are, for the first time, yourself."" Do you think this helped you in the roles you played in ""And The Band Played On"" or ""Gods and Monsters""?  I didn't turn myself into a queer actor, which I think a lot of people rather expected I ought to do or that was my new responsibility. I find heterosexuality far too interesting a phenomenon to avoid! Macbeth isn't gay nor is Richard III, or King Lear. I didn't want to cut myself off from all those things, but I had before coming out: I was in the first production of ""Bent,"" Martin Sherman's play, which went around the world educating people about the ill treatment of gay people in Nazi Germany. I played Edward II [in the play by the same name] -- that's the first play ever written about a gay hero by Christopher Marlowe. People still remember it as, ""My God! Two men kissing on television!"" That was in 1970. ""And The Band Played On,"" that's a play I really wanted to do because it's an important story, but the only reason I got it -- I was playing an American, I didn't really look anything like the character, and I didn't have his accent -- is they couldn't find an actor who would play an openly gay man! So they had to come across the pond to England! It's amazing how things have changed, isn't it?Did you ever feel scared to be vocal and stand up for what you believed was right because of how it would affect you personally or professionally?  When I first started out and when I had my first successes and became known as a decent actor, the leaders of the profession like John Gielgud, Michael Redgrave and Alec Guinness were gay or bisexual and, of course, never, ever, ever spoke about it till their dying day. So I had those examples; I just accepted it as a fact of life that I had to be quiet about it. I don't know that I ever lost a job when I did come out, but by that time I was so well established that it would have been perverse if they suddenly hadn't wanted me to carry on.However, it is true that my film career took off after I'd come out. One of the first parts that drew attention to me in cinema roles is ""Gods of Monsters,"" which is about a gay man. And it didn't bother the producers and director of ""Lord of the Rings"" that Gandalf was an openly gay man. There was some silly dirty remarks about ""Gandalf the gay,"" but [being gay] has not been an impediment either before I came out or after. I regret and always shall that I didn't see the significance of coming out at a much earlier date because I think I would have been a different person and a happier one. Self-confidence is the most important thing that anybody can have. You don't have that if part of you is ashamed or hiding something. I can reassure people who don't feel they're able to, the world will like you better because people like honesty and authenticity.If the Supreme Court rules in favor of marriage equality in June, what do you think will be the next biggest challenge facing the LGBTQ community?  Probably to look beyond your own country and see in what ways you can help people. There are many countries where it's still illegal to be gay. And there are countries like Russia where things are going backwards. The dreadful Section 28 -- which got me to come out -- says you cannot talk to young people about homosexuality and is now the law of the land in Russia. The [Russian] law actually uses the same language as Section 28. It really is a backward move. It wouldn't be easy for you or me to go and be honest in Russia, in the hearing of somebody under the age of 17, because we'd be breaking the law. It's a dreadful, dreadful situation. If the United States finds itself at ease with the idea of gay marriage -- whether people want to get married or not -- it will serve as a beacon for many other countries. It's so ironic that the first country [outside of Europe] to have gay marriage was so close to the United States -- Canada!Tell me about the new movie you're starring in, ""Mr. Holmes,"" and your other upcoming work.  Mr. Holmes is at the end of his life, he's 93. The last case that sent him away from detective work was when he was 60 and he is still niggling in solving that case -- which he does. He discovers a humanity and a sensitivity that perhaps will surprise people. That's all done and dusted and it opens on July 17 in the States. I got a small part [as Cogsworth] in the Disney film, ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which is being filmed in London. I just finished recording for the BBC TV which will be shown in the States next year. And a play called ""The Dresser"" about an old actor and his dresser. I play the dresser and Anthony Hopkins -- whom I've never worked with before -- plays the old actor. We had a ton of fun!Before we let you go, do you have any advice for LGBTQ youths, particularly those struggling with something right now and need help?  That they're not alone. They may feel very, very cut off. And the coming out journey may take a very long time -- as it did for me -- or it can all be done very, very quickly. But accept that it's a process. And it's a progress.And thank goodness there is so much literature -- there's so much online, so much positive literature that you can read! The Trevor Project is a good way to start. Their website recommends reading material and other ways in which you can contact other gay people. You'll discover that you're really not alone.
