Here's How It Can Be Fixed,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/child-homelessness-new-york-city_n_6924138.html,,2015-03-23,"Homeless in New York City - Naaliyah, a 5-year-old girl, has been shuttled from shelter to shelter since she and her mom were evicted from their apartment in July.

However, the group said the city could see “unprecedented” drops in child and family homelessness rates if it creates more reasonably priced housing options -- a cost-efficient system that has already proven to work.Nearly one-third of adults in homeless families in New York City are employed, yet they are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. The issue remains that low-cost housing is on the decline and their paychecks can’t cover market-rate apartments.While the Coalition applauded Mayor Bill de Blasio’s recent efforts to provide more permanent housing, which have helped lift more than 300 families out of homelessness since December, it said the issue requires an even more aggressive approach. Among its recommendations, the Coalition tasked de Blasio with allocating at least 2,500 apartments every year to homeless families. It urged Governor Andrew Cuomo to beef up the city’s rental assistance program, which prevents homelessness and helps families transition from shelters. Ending child homelessness requires an even greater sense of urgency, experts say, because the trauma occurs when the kids’ brains are still developing, which puts them at risk for developmental delays and struggling in school. They are more susceptible to human trafficking, abuse and hunger, Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, told The Huffington Post last year. The mayor recently demonstrated his resolve to expedite the housing process.De Blasio has been making robocalls to landlords around the city to offer them a $1,000 bonus for opening up an apartment to a “responsible” homeless family. The incentive is part of a city program that also offers rent subsidies, but requires tenants to put 30 percent of their salaries toward rent, according to WCBS 880. But experts say a systemic shift has to take hold before the issue can be addressed effectively on a national level. U.S. child homelessness rates have reached all-time highs, according to recent estimates, prompting experts to call the situation an “epidemic.” Yet, the issue remains largely hidden due to a mere technicality. Because of the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s exclusionary definition of homelessness, more than a million homeless kids have been discounted from official estimates. That, in turn, precludes state and local policymakers from using federal money to help them.“The nation hasn’t really prioritized family and child homelessness,” Carmela DeCandia, the National Center on Family Homelessness director told Stateline. “How are we going to target resources if we’re not on the same page about the size of the problem?”  Like Us On Facebook   Follow Us On Twitter  "

Meanwhile, there was this headline in the Savannah Morning News, ""Troubled Port Wentworth Marriage Ends in Murder"". These are two examples of how news media regularly misrepresent cases of domestic violence murders and murder-suicides; not just in their headlines but also in their reporting beneath the headlines. The end result of this skewed coverage is that the murder is presented as an outcome of a ""troubled relationship"" rather than as the end result of a violent abuser who is seeking to possessively control his partner, and in most cases, to prevent her from leaving him. In the WIVBTV News story about a murder-suicide involving an unidentified husband and wife, the reporter says, ""Neighbors say there was a long history of domestic violence in the Black Rock home, and a recent restraining order was supposed to protect the victim who lived inside the home."" The reporter added that the husband had also been suspected of having previously killed his ex-wife. Despite these clear indicators of prior domestic violence, the on-air reporters proceed to muddy the picture by saying, ""Neighbors say the woman was finally going to leave."" One particular neighbor was quoted as saying, ""She was bruised from head to toe but then she'd go running back to him"". With the absence of any expert commentary, this irresponsibly suggests that the wife was somehow culpable by going back to an abusive partner. Here, an expert commentator would likely have pointed out that returning to an abusive partner is common since abused women are at highest risk of being killed when they are leaving their partner. In the Savannah Morning News story about the murder of Nancy Sanders by her husband Kenneth, who stabbed her 27 times in front of their children, it was noted that he'd been arrested four months earlier for biting Nancy. Nancy's sister talked of how possessively controlling Kenneth was toward Nancy, relating how he would call her multiple times per day and show up at the house if she did not answer. ""My sister couldn't breathe"", the sister said. Kenneth Sanders had previously been arrested for stabbing his first wife. Despite this clear evidence of his past violence and smothering control, however, the report goes on to cite several of Nancy's problems. Rather than recognizing that her apparent depression might be related to being abused, the report says, ""The behavior noticed by her friends possibly related to fibromyalgia. Nancy was diagnosed with the disease, a chronic pain disorder closely related to depression, shortly before she was killed."" Adding insult to injury, the reporter mentioned that several years earlier Nancy ""had been involved in forgeries, according to court reports"". Meanwhile, the reporter includes a quote by Kenneth's brother who related that Kenneth had recently told him, ""I couldn't take it anymore"".These two cases are not isolated examples of how the media paints false pictures of intimate partner homicides. According to several studies of domestic homicide news coverage that were conducted by domestic violence experts, skewed or incomplete analysis are more the rule than the exception. According to the Washington Coalition Against Domestic Violence, only 22 percent of the 230 newspaper articles about domestic homicide that they analyzed specifically cited these as domestic violence-related incidents. A higher proportion of these stories, (48 percent), cited the killer's stated motivation, such as ""rejection"", ""rage"" or having been ""provoked"", as if this were a reason for killing rather than an excuse. One particularly egregious example was a front page headline in the Boston Herald that blared, ""Scratch Ticket Rub Out"" with a follow up headline, ""Cops: Lottery Habit Fueled Fatal Attack."" The story quoted the killer as saying that he killed his ex-wife because of her ""addiction"" to instant lottery scratch tickets (hence the ""rub out"" in the headline). This is a case where the killer's excuse was taken at face value even though it was subsequently revealed during his murder trial that his wife's lottery ticket purchases had nothing to do with his decision to kill her.A Rhode Island study of domestic violence-related murder-suicides found that newspapers were more likely to cast these as ""unpredictable private tragedies"" rather than as manifestations of domestic violence. A Massachusetts study of domestic homicides between the years 2003-2008 found that the media identified only 11 percent as having a history of domestic violence even though all of them had such histories. A more recent study in Iowa reported similar findings. One problem identified by all three studies was the lack of domestic violence experts as sources of information about these crimes. A fourth study, this one in Washington state, found that domestic violence experts were cited in only 4 out of the 44 stories about domestic homicides. Domestic violence experts provide important context to these homicides that help the public to understand that these are not ""troubled relationships gone awry"" or in the case of murder-suicides ""suicide pacts"" or ""mercy killings"". Nor are they ""crimes of passion"" or the ""provoked"" actions of ""jilted husbands"". Experts provide much-needed correctives to the obvious misinformation and biases offered by the killer's friends and relatives. Experts can also provide commentary about the reactions of neighbors who often state that ""they seemed like such a nice couple"" or (the killer) ""didn't seem like the type"". Experts can point out that most abusers don't fit the stereo-types of abusers as ""macho men"" or ""rageaholics"" and are often well-liked by their co-workers and neighbors. In my own study of attempted homicides, neighbors rarely knew about prior domestic violence, according to the victims. As one victim put it, ""(the neighbors) liked him (the abuser) way more than they liked me"". By relying solely on non-experts as sources of information, the media wittingly or unwittingly reinforces misconceptions about domestic homicides, and sometimes seems more intent to entertain than to inform the public. Domestic homicide is most often the culmination of a history of domestic violence in which victims are being abused right in front of our eyes and in broad daylight. The real tragedy is that we don't see it because we are looking for something else; something that more closely matches our preconceptions. Domestic homicides sometimes provide experts with the opportunity to call attention to the underlying realities -- but only when the media thinks to call us. One excellent resource about media coverage of domestic violence of domestic violence homicides is ""Domestic Violence: A Guide for Media Coverage"" published by the Iowa Domestic Abuse Death Review Team. It contains concrete recommendations for accurate and responsible reporting about domestic violence. Good reporting isn't just a matter of better informing the public but also helps surviving victims to understand their experience in a larger context and to recognize that they are not alone, and their loved ones to heal.

Whether you are settling for a relationship that doesn't meet your needs, a job that doesn't light up your soul or a lifestyle that doesn't inspire you, I believe you were meant for more. Here are six reasons you're settling for a lackluster life, but more importantly what to do about it starting now. 1. Everyone's doing it... right?   We've been taught that work isn't supposed to be fun, that marriage is hard, and that life is about making the best of the cards you are dealt. Somehow we have created a society of settlers complaining about our lives and accepting that this is just how things are. Wearing stress and overwhelm as badges of honor we connect with other people just like us and we come to believe-this is life.2. My life is OK. Who am I to want more?  Depending on how you were raised, you may think it's selfish to want more than you have. You think that by having more money or wanting more happiness and joy in your life that you're just being greedy. You may even believe that by having more for yourself, you are taking away from those who are worse off than you. You think to yourself: ""I should just be happy with what I've got.""3. You fear the unknown.  While your life may be a bit lackluster overall, you find comfort in the monotony. Reaching for bigger and better things that you truly desire could lead you to experiences that are far outside your comfort zone and it's scary. Instead of feeling the fear and doing it anyway, you settle for less because it feels safe. 4. You think it's too late to change.  You've invested so much time and effort in this life, that you can't fathom making a change this late in the game. How would you start? What would you lose? What if you fail? These questions float through your mind and instead of imagining the best possible outcome, you allow your fear to overpower your desire and you succumb to the realization that...this is it.5. You're bound by your current reality.  Every choice you make is based on your current reality and you are stuck in that story. In your mind there is no other way. You work, you pay bills, and you take care of your family, but there is no room for anything outside of that. What you see is what you get and you are stuck in a constant cycle of the same lackluster experiences day in and day out. Simply put, you're stuck in a rut and can't get out.6. You've forgotten what it feels like to dream.  When you were younger, you thought anything was possible, but as an adult you've let go of the wonder and magic of life and focus solely on what is directly in front of you. You don't even remember what it feels like to be inspired anymore. You've let your logical mind guide you to merely surviving and you simply don't have time for pie in the sky dreams because you live in reality. Life is about connection, expansion, joy, abundance, and love. It's about fulfilling our calling and becoming more of our true selves and I assure you, you were meant for more than the lackluster life you have been living. It's time to shake things up starting now.It's about time you:• Dream again  Get out of your head and into your heart. What do you truly want your life to become? If money weren't an issue what would you do? Think about how you want your life to feel. If not lackluster than what? Fulfilling? Inspired? Joyful? Abundant? Get in touch with your heart's desires and let them lead the way.• Expand your network  The world is full of people living the dream doing what they love and it's time for you to connect with more people like that. Join groups, classes, meet ups and the like to expand your network. Inspiration is contagious and it will easily liven up your life.• Get out of your comfort zone  Everything you desire lies just outside your comfort zone and in order to get it, you are going to have to take the leap. Make a commitment to yourself to do something that stretches you a bit and don't be afraid to keep reaching. The more you are willing to do that, the better your life will become. • Give yourself permission to do what you love  We are so bound by what we have to do that we often don't give ourselves time to do what we love. Give yourself permission to do what you love simply because you love it. Life is meant to be enjoyed, so make the most of it.Let's keep the conversation going.

5,RELIGION,Most Mainline Protestants Embrace Gay Marriage,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mainline-protestants-gay-marriage_n_6901430.html,,2015-03-22,"WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 20 Jeff Buhrman, artistic director, leads the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington D.C. - the largest of its kind in the nation - during rehearsal for their December holiday concert at New York Avenue Presbyterian Church on November 20, 2011, in Washington, DC. (photo by Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fcf0200000c101018b4b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) With the largest Presbyterian denomination’s official endorsement Tuesday (March 17), American mainline Protestants have solidified their support for gay marriage, leaving the largest mainline denomination — the United Methodist Church — outside the same-sex marriage fold.Methodists, with more than 7 million members, rejected same-sex marriage at their last national conference, in 2012. They are likely to revisit the question at their next conference, in 2016, but a growing membership in Africa, where there is little acceptance of homosexuality, makes it unlikely the denomination will accept gay marriage.Another denomination generally considered mainline, the American Baptist Churches USA, does not allow same-sex marriage, nor do a handful of smaller mainline denominations. But the Episcopal Church, the United Church of Christ and now the Presbyterian Church (USA) sanctify the marriage of two men or two women. The 3.8 million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America gives congregations the autonomy to decide for themselves.“There is no group that has moved more quickly or more dramatically on this issue than white mainline Protestants,” said Dan Cox, research director of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit that studies trends in American religion.In 2003, 36 percent of white mainline Protestants supported gay marriage, compared with 62 percent in 2014, Cox said.And though there is not one Protestant on the Supreme Court, the fact that an increasing number of the nation’s churches are inviting gay couples to the altar is likely to weigh on the justices as they consider upcoming cases that would allow them to make gay marriage a right.Cox notes that among white mainline Protestants, Presbyterians and Methodists in the pews hold strikingly similar views on gay marriage. In that same 2014 PRRI survey, 69 percent of Presbyterians approved of same-sex marriage, while 67 percent of U.S. Methodists did.“Support for gay marriage in these denominational families is quite strong,” Cox said. “It’s hard to say the churches are actually leading on this issue. They are reflecting where their followers already are.”The Rev. Jeremy Smith, minister of discipleship at First United Methodist Church in Portland, Ore., said the Presbyterian vote reminds Methodists to ask themselves why their own doctrine is the way it is.“Why is this still on the books?” he said. “In the Methodist Church we have been behind the culture.”The majority of church-affiliated Americans belong to denominations that forbid gay marriage, including Roman Catholics, most Baptists, Pentecostals, evangelicals and Mormons.Mainline Protestants, once the majority in America, have lost ground in recent decades to other denominations and to independent churches.This week’s Presbyterian Church vote was long expected after 61 percent of General Assembly delegates voted in June to allow gay and lesbian weddings. That made the 1.8 million-member PCUSA among the largest Christian denominations to take an embracing step toward same-sex marriage.But the change did not become church law until a majority of the 171 regional presbyteries, or geographic regions, voted to ratify the new language. The threshold was reached Tuesday when the Palisades Presbytery in New Jersey became the 86th to approve a change in the denomination’s constitution making marriage a commitment “between two people, traditionally a man and a woman.”"

This is despite the fact that billions of us take these services for granted. We have known how to deliver affordable, safe water for more than 100 years yet for more than 2.5 billion people these services are absent. Some of the reasons this problem persists include the high cost of infrastructure, complex governance, lack of proper operations & maintenance, unrealistically low water tariffs, poor water utility management, poorly targeted subsidies and misguided development assistance.Yet, today, like every day, people are finding water somewhere. They are coping and making decisions with incredibly difficult trade-offs. Do they drink the water from the brown stream outside their home or walk five miles to a ""cleaner"" stream? Or do they purchase water of marginally better quality from a private water vendor that will cost 25 percent of their income that day? Should the pay to use a public toilet, or risk their safety by waiting for nightfall to defecate alongside the railroad track?Beyond the day-to-day decisions, there are also difficult long-term decisions for people to make. Should they purchase a simple water filter that might cost two month's wages? Should they purchase a rainwater harvesting system that might cost six month's wages? Should they save for months if not years to pay the connection fee to gain piped water access to the local utility? Should they make the substantial investment in building a toilet at their home or installing a simple latrine?While access to clean water and sanitation is still a massive problem for billions, over the past two decades more than 2 billion people have managed to cope with these trade-offs in a way that has allowed them to gain access to improved water supplies and sanitation. While some have benefitted from top-down aid and subsidies, we know many more have secured improved water and sanitation through their own financial sacrifices and tapping into informal credit markets -- loan sharks. These realities and our insights inspired us to think more in terms of system change than delivering heavily subsidized solutions to those living in poverty. By nudging financial systems, hundreds of millions of people could gain access to water and sanitation even in the absence of subsidies at the household level. To set this in motion, capital for water and sanitation services for those living at the base of the economic pyramid must be ubiquitous and affordable.We have learned that even those earning as little as $1.25 per day will access financing to help them seek new options for meeting their needs. We believe that hundreds of millions of those lacking critical water and sanitation services can be reached by continuing to remove financial and other roadblocks, allowing them to move from unserved potential beneficiaries to empowered customers.For decades, the sector has approached household level water and sanitation access for the poor through raising money and disbursing it in the form of subsidies to cover the cost of wells and toilets. This charity-led approach is not sustainable or scalable at a level needed to confront the global water crisis. For a large segment of the population in need, it is unnecessary to rely upon charity dollars.Water.org has made great strides in demonstrating the viability of the market at the base of the economic pyramid that could be unleashed if fueled by affordable capital. The research of others points to a multi-billion dollar market that is primed to tap into affordable finance to secure water and sanitation solutions. Addressing the water and sanitation needs of those that can participate financially will leave charity dollars for those living in abject poverty and help break the cycle of poverty.To truly grasp the effect of the WaterCredit solution, we follow Grace's story in Kenya:Grace and her family had always hoped to afford a rainwater catchment system and water tank. She imagined the day when her young daughter wouldn't have to walk to collect water. Grace and her daughter used to collect water from a nearby stream and it was a time-consuming chore, during which she dreamed of a better way. Through Water.org's WaterCredit, Grace and her husband got a loan to purchase a rain catchment system and a water tank. Now, each rainy day brings an abundance of water such that Grace has enough and can share it with her neighbors, improving the lives of her family, and the community where they live.It is through our strategic alliances -- our strongest partnerships with organizations, corporations and their foundations -- that Water.org has been able to impact the lives of people like Grace in key geographies worldwide. This growing community of donors and influencers including the IKEA Foundation, PepsiCo Foundation, Caterpillar Foundation, The MasterCard Foundation, Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Bank of America Foundation and Swiss Re Foundation has continued to support Water.org in its effort to innovate and accelerate progress against the global water crisis. To date, Water.org has mobilized more than $30 million in commitments to expand and scale WaterCredit worldwide from its strategic alliances, representing an incredible opportunity to enhance financial inclusion for water and sanitation needs at the base of the economic pyramid. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) has been an incredibly helpful platform for Water.org, helping the organization meet and start its relationship with some of these critical supporters. In particular, Water.org initially met with the IKEA Foundation at CGI's Clinton Global Citizen Award ceremony in 2012, which launched the beginning of a long-term partnership between the two organizations. To date, the IKEA Foundation has awarded Water.org with $6 million in grant funding to accelerate the growth of WaterCredit in Bangladesh and its innovation pipeline. These efforts will empower a minimum of 178,000 people with access to safe water and/or sanitation.While Water.org has achieved great progress over the years, there is still much to be done. In the spirit of the World Water Day, we would like to take this opportunity to once again thank the enablers that have supported us, and welcome those who wish to join us in our mission to achieve universal access to water and sanitation. World Water Day is March 22; please join @Water this #WorldWaterDay to help make every day water day for people in need. http://WaterDay.org"

Milan free after deliberating for one hour.The museum's exhibits detail the 1955 murder and key moments in the trial, which attracted wide attention at the time.Months after the trial, the pair confessed in a paid magazine interview to abducting and killing Till, who had been visiting from Chicago, in what they said was retribution for his having whistled at Bryant's wife.Work on both projects in the struggling town of a few hundred people began after the Tallahatchie Board of Supervisors issued a formal apology over the Till affair in 2006. It also established the Emmett Till Memorial Commission to bring attention to a racially charged incident that had for decades gone mostly undiscussed locally, said commission co-chairman John Wilchie.""For a long time, the people in Tallahatchie County were afraid to even talk about it,"" he said.A public ceremony to celebrate the twin projects was set to take place on the square, which looks much as it did when journalists from around the world descended on it 60 years ago, and will feature speeches from Mississippi political leaders along with musical performances.Museum director Patrick Weems said his facility, which features the only publicly available library in town, together with the restoration of the courthouse, has helped foster a long overdue sense of racial reconciliation in the area.Coinciding with the renovation of several buildings on the square, along with the opening of an art gallery and a restaurant, the projects have also helped rejuvenate Sumner, he said.""I don't think it's a stretch to say the courthouse has saved the town,"" he said.

He told Netanyahu on Thursday that Washington would have to ""reassess"" its policies in the Middle East.Israel's Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz, a close Netanyahu ally, acknowledged the problem but pointed the finger at Washington for failing to understand the prime minister's position.""If the Americans are finding it difficult to understand or accept our clarifications (on Palestinian statehood), this is certainly worrying and requires tending to,"" he told Israel Radio. ""He (Netanyahu) didn't say this (statehood) is 'unacceptable'. He said reality has changed.""PAY A PRICEIsrael's close alliance with the United States has been a fundamental pillar of its security throughout its 67 year history, and Netanyahu's political foes have accused him of jeopardizing it.Netanyahu has long had a difficult relationship with Obama, and made it worse two weeks before the election by addressing the U.S. Congress at the invitation of opposition Republicans to condemn the administration's nuclear negotiations with Iran.Asked if U.S.-Israel relations were at a dangerous point, McCain, a leading voice on foreign affairs in the Republican-controlled Congress, said: ""I think that's up to the president of the United States.""""Get over your temper tantrum, Mr. President,"" McCain said on CNN. ""The least of your problems is what Bibi Netanyahu said during an election campaign. If every politician were held to everything they say in a political campaign, obviously that would be a topic of long discussion.""Amos Yadlin, a former chief of Israeli military intelligence aligned with the center-left Zionist Union which lost the vote to Netanyahu, said Israel would ""pay a price"" for Netanyahu's remarks on statehood, which had caused ""fury"" in Washington.""I'm not among those who panic: I don't think the United States will impose sanctions on Israel. But I see places in which it will go much harder for us,"" said Yadlin, who returned a day earlier from a visit to the U.S. capital. ""Firstly, they used a word that they haven't used since 1975 - 'reassessment', a reassessment of relations.""President Reuven Rivlin began the formal process on Sunday of consulting political parties to nominate a candidate to form a governing coalition, largely a foregone conclusion after Netanyahu's victory.Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, is likely to be given the nod as early as Wednesday to start what could be up to 42 days of negotiations with potential cabinet partners. He is expected to build a coalition with far-right, religious and centrist parties, on course to becoming Israel's longest-serving prime minister.His comments on a Palestinian state were part of a hard rightward tack that helped deliver the election victory after polls predicted he would lose to the center-left Zionist Union.Obama also took Netanyahu to task for an Internet post on the day of the election in which the prime minister urged right-wing supporters to vote because Arab Israelis were doing so in large numbers.Netanyahu publicly embraced an independent state for Palestinians in a speech in 2009, but Palestinians have long questioned his sincerity, noting his expansion of Israeli settlements on occupied land. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called Netanyahu's latest comments ""very worrying.""With no peace talks under way, the Palestinians have taken steps to seek international recognition of their independence unilaterally. So far most Western countries have held back from diplomatic recognition, arguing that a Palestinian state should emerge from negotiations with Israel.Washington has long used its veto in the U.N. Security Council to prevent the United Nations from taking steps to recognize Palestinian independence. Some in Israel are concerned that Obama's ""reassessment"" could jeopardize that stance.Silvan Shalom, a Likud cabinet minister, said Israel would have little incentive to seek a peace deal if the United States and other countries ""lend a hand"" to unilateral Palestinian moves. If that happens, he told Army Radio, ""then what is the point of signing another (peace) accord?""

It will provide project loans to developing countries and is slated to begin operations at the end of 2015.The United States' key strategic allies in the region, Australia, Japan and South Korea, are also considering joining the proposed Beijing-based bank.Early opposition to the AIIB from Western countries partially dissolved after Britain said this month it would join, with France, Germany and Italy swiftly following suit.Canberra could formally decide to sign up to the AIIB when the full cabinet meets on Monday, Australian media have said.At least eight more countries may join the lender by the March 31 deadline, Jin Liqun, secretary-general of the interim secretariat that is establishing the AIIB, told a panel at the conference on Sunday.The fund will have approval from its shareholders at the start to double its capitalization to $100 billion, he said.""China will follow the rules of the international community and will not bully other members but work together with them and try to reach consensus in all the decisions we make without brandishing the majority shareholder status,"" he said.BANDWAGONIn an editorial published on the same day, China's official Xinhua news agency suggested that the United States might be embarrassed that many of its allies had not heeded its warnings.""For decision-makers in the United States, they really have to be reminded that if they do not jump on the bandwagon of change in time, they will soon be overrun by the bandwagon itself,"" it said.IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Sunday that the fund would be ""delighted"" to cooperate with the AIIB.China's Lou and ADB President Takehiko Nakao said at the conference they had held discussions on possible cooperation, with the Chinese finance minister adding that topics discussed included safeguard standards.Lou has previously said AIIB would complement rather than compete with other institutions such as the ADB, the Manila-based multilateral lender dominated by Japan and the United States.The AIIB's Jin said developing countries in Asia would receive the bulk of loans for infrastructure projects, which could be co-provided with commercial banks and pension funds.Non-Asian countries would also only hold 25 percent of the AIIB's shareholding, lower than their stakes at the founding of the ADB, he said.

Three years ago, the Court in a 5-4 vote maintained the key precepts of the law which at the time was little more than a legal concept.Today, the ACA is far more than a concept. It has become a right for the more than 8 million Americans who have gained coverage under the law. Now what conservatives are trying to do is rip away what can be literally life saving coverage.Make no mistake. These three words -- Affordable Care Act -- are definitely meaningful to those who now have coverage, many for the first time in their lives. The insurance they have is affordable. It provides good care. And, our nation has affirmatively acted. But the conservatives don't care about this -- or for those who have received coverage. They're just hell-bent to take away something that they have but don't want others to have as well. It's insurance protection that we've seen is important to those who are now covered.Take Jersey City, New Jersey for example. We've been aggressively signing our residents up for what is their right under the law. And residents are responding in a big way. In fact, Jersey City is leading New Jersey in providing access to health care through the ACA with 10 percent of the State's enrollees living in Jersey City. Our outreach has been vigorous and we've worked to reach every community in the City, in the places they work, live and even relax. We've partnered with community leaders and local non-profits, hired bilingual staff, and made a strong push to enroll as many residents as possible with health care coverage as this benefits not only the individual but the entire community. In our city alone the positive benefits of the ACA can't be argued. When the law went into effect, approximately 55,000 Jersey City residents, nearly 20 percent of our population, were without health care coverage. Now 40 percent of those previously with no protection have insurance and we are not yet done. These numbers make it clear -- there is a true need for quality, affordable health care and that's what conservatives are trying to take away from their fellow Americans. Not only do they want to punish some of our most vulnerable citizens, they also want to strip what is now a basic American right under the law for what I believe is merely a partisan objective.We're probably going to have to wait until June before we know the Court's decision and it's my hope that common sense will rule. The Justices should not take away what is now an important part of American citizenship. --Steven Fulop is the Mayor of Jersey City, NJ."

(AP Photo/File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8eea02200005700dd8305.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. must release photographs showing abuse of detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan, a federal judge has ruled in a long-running clash over letting the world see potentially disturbing images of how the military treated prisoners.U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein's ruling Friday gives the government, which has fought the case for over a decade, two months to decide whether to appeal before the photos could be released.The American Civil Liberties Union has been seeking to make the photos, including images from the infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, public in the name of holding government accountable.""The photos are crucial to the public record,"" said Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director. ""They're the best evidence of what took place in the military's detention centers.""The Defense Department is studying the ruling and will make any further responses in court, spokesman Lt. Col. Myles Caggins III said.The fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it invokes the images of abuse at Abu Ghraib that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006. Early in the 2004 lawsuit, the ACLU pointed to the Abu Ghraib photos as priority examples of records the organization was seeking on the treatment of detainees.It's unclear how many more photographs may exist. The government has said it has 29 relevant pictures from at least seven different sites in Afghanistan and Iraq, and it's believed to have perhaps hundreds or thousands more, Hellerstein said in a ruling in August. He said some photos he had seen ""are relatively innocuous while others need more serious consideration,"" and he has ruled that any images that would be released would be redacted to protect the identities of people in them.Some photographs, taken by service members in Iraq and Afghanistan, were part of criminal investigations of alleged abuse. Some images show ""soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees,"" then-Solicitor General — now Supreme Court Justice — Elena Kagan wrote in an appeal to the high court earlier in the case, which has taken a long road through the courts and Congress.The government has long argued that releasing the photographs could incite attacks against U.S. forces and government personnel abroad, and officials have said that risk hasn't abated as the U.S. military role in Iraq and Afghanistan lessened.Indeed, ""the danger associated with release of these photographs is heightened now,"" amid the rise of the Islamic State militant group, Navy Rear Adm. Sinclair Harris, the vice director for operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a December court filing. Islamic State, he said ""would use these photographs to further encourage its supporters and followers to attack U.S. military and government personnel.""The ACLU said it was inappropriate to give the government that kind of censorial power.""To allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone, somewhere, to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents' misconduct,"" Jaffer said.Amid the lawsuit, Congress passed a 2009 law allowing the government to keep the photos secret if the secretary of defense certified that unveiling them would endanger U.S. citizens or government or military personnel.Defense secretaries have since done so, but Hellerstein said the government hasn't been specific enough.___Associated Press writer Lou Kesten contributed to this report from Washington."

(Indeed, our own system of government is poorly understood by our own citizens.) In such systems, e.g., Israel's, where no party receives a majority, it is customary, but not required, that the country's president, ask the leader of the party with the most seats to form a government. The Queen of England performs a similar function.But, it is within his discretion to ask others instead. Whether they can do so, and cobble together a majority of seats, of course, is a steeper climb. Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, fully expected to be asked to form a government, even if he came in second because of his allies in other right wing and religious parties would make a majority.Israel's President, Reuven (""Ruvi"") Rivlin, should study the election results carefully. It appears that the win in the last 24-48 hours was due to Netanyahu's desperate admissions that has been lying for years about his support for a two-state solution and his hysterical appeals to fear that ""Arabs were voting in large numbers,"" shifted votes from further right-wing parties into Likud's column to prevent his leading opponent from claiming the victory mantle.In winning this way, however, Netanyahu destroyed Israel's credibility in the world, and with it, Israel's security as a state.Israel's existence and viability is increasingly important as growing anti-semitism in the EU, Eastern Europe and Russia are creating a legitimate fear that was expressed so poignantly in Ari Shavit's My Promised Land that ""Jews' days in Europe are numbered,"" referring to the beginning of the 20th century and culminating in the Holocaust, but may be recurring today. If ""never again"" is to be a reality, a strong, respected, secure State of Israel that can both demand preventative actions by others, and serve as a refuge if necessary.Just when Israel's existence and influence on the world stage is most important for Jews around the world, it cannot afford to risk that for the self-aggrandizement of Benjamin Netanyahu. The way he won his election has weakened Israel, destroyed its credibility and made it far less secure.With respect to the allegation that the Israeli public is to blame for re-electing this man, one would respond that demagogues know how to pull emotional triggers, and while the Israeli public cannot be exempted from responsibility, neither should they shoulder all of the consequences of being so manipulated. In a parliamentary system, there is a safety valve: The largely ceremonial position of president, and, hopefully, the wisdom and prudence of potential coalition partners. If there are alternatives to a Netanyahu led government, President Rivlin owes it to his country to find it. Even a Likud-led government with someone other than Netanyahu running it would be better."

The legendary moment is when Julia Roberts, playing down-and-out LA sex worker Vivian Ward, walks into a Rodeo Drive boutique to buy an expensive and elegant evening gown. She is soon rudely asked to leave by the shop assistants. Her provocative attire and slap-dash look make both think that poor Vivian doesn't have a cent to her name.Loaded up with cash but unable to use any of her $100s, Vivian despondently exists the store, upset at how these women ""wouldn't let her shop"". (Memorably another '90s movie, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, paid tribute to this scene. While watching Pretty Woman, Michele says to Romy, ""I just get really happy when they finally let her shop."") After later Vivian wins her way into respective Rodeo society, she returns to the scene of the (fashion) crime and dishes out some home truths to the snotty shop clerks.Vivian is a local L.A. street girl whose roommate has used up all their rent money on drugs while Vivian is struggling to make ends meet working the streets. One night as Vivian takes a walk down Hollywood Boulevard a flash sports car pulls up and the dashing and debonair Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) pokes his head out the window. The sauve Edward asks her to help him with directions around Hollywood before Vivian soon slides inside. Edward asks Vive to be his girl for a week-long rendezvous, with one condition -- that she join him for dinner as his female companion for a business meeting. But after cruising through Beverly Hills with her hundred dollar bills trying to find an outfit appropriate to wear that night, Vivian is escorted out of the high-end stores because of her skimpy clothes and unrefined attitude. As you can expect, emotions get mixed up in Edward and Vive's transactional sexual arrangement and Edward must soon choose whether to stick to his cool cold business tricks or make this beautiful but uncultured woman his girl. Between expensive jewellery and limousine trips, Edward and Vivian work out their differences and happiness ensues by film's end.Looking back at Pretty Woman, it's not hard to see the era it was made in. The film came out right at the end of the 1980s and that decade's big business boom, high-end fashion culture, and obsession with luxury, wealth and coin. We see the glamorous hotel rooms, decadent and exotic meals, and the ravishing clothes and hats Vivian gets along her Beverly Hill shopping strips.The film proved to be an enormous success when it was first released in 1990 and has since become one of the seminal movies of the romantic-comedy genre. It also helped launch Julia Roberts's acting career and gave the Hollywood star her first Best Actress Academy Award nomination -- a rare feat even by today's standards since Roberts played a sex worker. Of course, being an American film, Pretty Woman joins the mythology captured in cinema people trying to climb the social ladder out of the slums and into the mansions. Undoubtedly, many women have watched the film believing that a gallant and rich man could sweep them off their feet and make them his girl, too. Either way, Pretty Woman still offers an excitingly escapist tale. Many of us can believe that the handsome Gere will one day cruise up to us on a street corner somewhere and asks us to join him inside.With her bad blonde wig and safety pins holding her imitation leather boots, Roberts still dazzles us with her earthy, warm, and self-deprecating Vivian 25 years on. She transforms from the anxious, risqué and cash-strapped Hollywood girl into a beautiful, assertive and self-aware woman after her windswept romance with Edward in their luxurious hotel room. While 50 Shades of Grey has recently captured our attentions and titillated our imagination, it may be time to forget about the s-and-m kink and stripped back Beyoncé tracks and instead indulge in a Pretty Woman  couch session. You'll see Julia Roberts work the streets in black thigh-high pumps, a black American Express credit card, and, of course, encounter an intensely romantic fire-escape reunion that will leave you begging for more.But we warned: you will be singing that title track by Roy Orbison for weeks afterwards. I know I still am."

(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc147e1240000d30b51b83b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A couple of days ago in Singapore, I drove past Lee Kuan Yew's modest house on Oxley Road and wondered how he was. Rumors were rife that he was unwell, and I was tempted to break protocol and pay him a visit. Had I done so, I wouldn't have found him there. The country's founding father had been at Singapore General Hospital since early February, suffering from severe pneumonia.I had last seen Mr. Lee at a celebratory banquet in Singapore several months ago. It was a formal affair, but he showed up in a windbreaker and casual trousers, and he spoke with a firm voice and then took questions from the audience. I raised my hand, more to seek his attention than anything else.My question was somewhat naïve: ""What explains Singapore phenomenal economic growth, its reputation as a corruption-free society?""It was a question that Mr. Lee had surely been asked many times before, including by me in previous one-on-one interviews he'd given when he was Singapore's prime minister until 1990.And just as surely, his response was predictable: ""We took the world as we found it, and then we built on our dreams. We wanted to build a prosperous nation in a sea of poverty.""This year, his beloved Singapore will mark its 50th anniversary of independence from the federation that once joined it with the erstwhile Malaya. The official anniversary will be celebrated on August 7, but Mr. Lee will not be present at any of the plethora of events.He died on Monday at the age of 91. And with his demise, modern Asia has lost all of its postwar political wizards, men and women who carved entire countries from the clangor of colonial rule or from disputes with neighbors. They were men and women who fought for independence, often at grave risk to themselves. They gave shape to their respective polities. They imprinted their special stamp of governance -- democratic or dictatorial -- on the nations they helped create. They attracted the attention of the world's superpowers to the possibilities of military alliances and market development. After all, as the United Nations notes, Asia is the world's most populous continent, with its 4.3 billion inhabitants accounting for 60 percent of the world population of more than seven billion. They are all gone now, felled by old age or assassins' bullets: India's Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter Indira Gandhi; China's Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping; Indonesia's Soekarno and Suharto; Sri Lanka's Solomon and his wife Sirimavo Bandaranaike, and Junius Richard Jayewardene; Pakistan's Mohammed Ali Jinnah; Bangladesh's Sheikh Mujibur Rahman; and Malaysia's Tunku Abdul Rahman.Each was a political titan, of course. But Lee Kuan Yew was arguably the only one of this galaxy of giants who lived to see his nation transformed from a third world country into one of the world's wealthiest one. With a population of 5.4 million, its per capita income is $81,000; neighboring India, with a population of 1.3 billion, has a per capita income of barely $2,000.As Mr. Lee -- widely known as ""Harry Lee,"" a moniker he acquired while a law student at the University of Cambridge -- often explained, Singapore's economic success was the consequence of three interrelated factors: total commitment to free enterprise; total commitment to a rules-driven society; and total commitment to a corruption-free system.When pressed, Mr. Lee would acknowledge that a restrained press was an advantage in Singapore's development velocity.""I had to do some nasty things, locking fellows up without trial,"" Mr. Lee said in an interview with The New York Times published in September 2010. ""I'm not saying everything I did was right. But everything I did was for an honorable purpose.""It may have been honorable, but it also intimidated proponents of democracy. Mr. Lee's ruling People's Action Party has been in power for the last 50 years, and it was only in the 2011 ""elections"" to the 84-member national parliament that an opposition grouping raised its presence to six seats from the previous two seats it'd won in 2006.That meant nothing, of course. Harry Lee ran Singapore as a family fiefdom -- albeit a clean one: One of his sons, Lee Tsien Loong is prime minister; a younger son, Lee Hsien Yang, is the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore; a daughter, Dr. Lee Wei Ling, runs the National Neuroscience Institute; and the prime minister's wife, Ho Ching, is executive director and chief executive of Temasek Holdings, a government holding company. She's widely considered one of the most influential executives in the global corporate world.In the coming days, encomiums will most certainly come cascading in about the scrupulous -- if authoritarian -- life that Lee Kuan Yew led. Singapore is widely considered as a role model for developing countries yearning to establish more prosperous societies, and surely that role model's ethos couldn't have been created by anyone other than a man possessing Mr. Lee's determination and steely will. What may be overlooked in these encomiums is Harry Lee's emphasis on a society with 100 percent literacy. And that emphasis also led to broadening the notion of what many Singaporeans called the ""literacy of governance.""It resulted in the establishment of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. Its first -- and continuing -- head was the former diplomat Kishore Mahbubani. The school trains current and future leaders, mostly from developing countries. The idea is to inculcate in them values such as clean government, attentiveness to everyday people's concerns, and effective municipal management.That may be Harry Lee's greatest legacy."

Poland is coming under great pressure and now anyone else who wants to join in to this defensive capability will come under this diplomatic and political pressure,"" Breedlove said.

Seven reasons why this section of the Abraham Path still exceeds anyone's expectations.1. Descending Wadi DanaOn the King's Highway towards Dana village there are still patches of snow, remnants of a storm two weeks ago that closed off parts of mountainous Jordan from the rest of the country. But spring has commenced. From breakfast at the Dana Lodge, we descend 900m, seven hours and four ecosystems into Wadi Dana. This is Jordan's largest nature reserve and one of the few where you can hike both independently and with a guide. We wander past granite rock formations, limestone, and sandstone cliffs. The wadi is pristine, its trail rocky, then smooth, then overflown with a stream that carries away the last melting snow from the 1600m ridge above us. Dana hosts 700 plant species, 200 kinds of birds and 40 types of mammal: not the diversity you would associate with the Middle East. 2. Feynan Stargazing We end our first day at Feynan, arriving at the point where Wadi Dana opens up into the Araba Valley: the middle of nowhere. I heard much about Feynan Ecolodge before, as one of Jordan's most inspiring, off-the-beaten-track places to stay in Jordan. But there's nothing like the special feeling of entering someplace unique after a day's journey on foot. The lodge is entirely off the grid and powered by the sun for its core needs; the 26 rooms and restaurant use less electricity than one city apartment in Amman. Hundreds of locally made candles light up at night. Every detail and every color belongs. Staffed entirely by locals from the area, 80 Bedouin families benefit from preserving nature and their own culture at Feynan.After the sun sets, the evening pastime is stargazing on the rooftop terrace. Suleiman is the master of its larger-than-life telescope. With his green laser pen he points out how to navigate one's way from one constellation to the next. In eloquent English he instructs us: ""Follow the Big Dipper and draw a line that extends five times from the distance between the final two stars. There: you arrive at the North Star. Oh, and this is where I was born"", he points his laser to a cave about four hundred meters from the lodge, ""and where I live now"", shifting the green beam to a Bedouin tent one hundred meters further. He then reprograms the telescope. ""Here are the rings of Saturn. There, the four moons of Jupiter."" Peddling through time and space, Suleiman hosts us between earth and sky. 3. Walking the Rim of Mt. Safaha Many travelers know Jordan is abundant with remote wilderness, but few places will have such shifting vistas as the landscapes on this trek. On the rim of Mt. Safaha for some eight hours, one epic set of scenery unfolds after the other. There is no lack of amazing scenery across the other 1000 plus km the Abraham Path presently features across the Middle East. But I have not walked any region where the land shifts so dramatically at every turn as between Dana and Petra.4. Mysterious Little Petra Few visitors to Petra take the time to visit Petra's smaller sister. Seven km north of the main city, Little Petra is secluded in the Siq al-Barid or ""the Cold Canyon"". Cold because little sunlight can penetrate the backside through which we enter and descend past carved temples and villas, following a maze of rock-cut stairs winding up the cliffs without beginning or end. In Nabatean times, trading caravans stopped here, with their masters refreshing themselves before visiting the larger city for business. Two millennia ago, this region was the epicenter of cosmopolitanism, the New York City of its era: crossroads of art, trade, and a mind-blowing blend of classical architecture. One villa still features a rare painted ceiling in which a lush tree hides a winged cupid with bow and arrow. Walking trails, however narrow and nimble they are on the map of human activity, have this amazing ability to connect the hidden gems. 5. PetraThe trail between Little Petra and Petra takes us past small sand dunes and mellow green patches of winter wheat, followed by a Bronze Age settlement, steeper cliffs, and then, the city of Petra, member of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Visitors entering Petra the traditional way -from the village of Wadi Musa through the Siq towards the Treasury -- experience a blend of amazement and déjà vu. Yes, it is amazing, and yes, you have seen it many times before: in a dozen movies, videogames, novels, and thousands of travel magazines and guidebooks.We enter through an alternative route, a ""back stage"" entrance into Petra. No déjà vu for us. (A practical note is in order here: you do need to have entry tickets pre-arranged). We walk from up high on the flanks of Mt. al-Deir towards the Monastery. This is Petra's largest monument, its iconic urn visible from afar. Few sights in the world can be more rewarding after a few hours of walking. The dimensions are incredible: the doorway is taller than a house; the urn on top over 10m high. In front of the Monastery we sit down for tea and philosophize on our journey these past days and how the world can get familiar with the other face of the Middle East. We come up with a long list of travel and film celebrities who should make the foot journey we have just made. 6. Mt. Haroun Hospitality""Maqamaat"", holy shrines situated on mountain tops have always fascinated me. On top of the highest peak in the Petra region sits the Maqam of Haroun, Arabic for Aaron, the brother of Moses. It is visible from many of the cliffs nearer to Petra: a bright white dome on top of a distinctive mountain peak, a sacred place for the Abrahamic faiths. According to tradition Aaron was buried here. There are competing narratives on locations elsewhere in the Middle East, but pilgrims have climbed up here for centuries. It features Byzantine ruins, large water cisterns, and a set of beautiful steps up to the highest point of the Maqam. Just before our final ascent, we reach a plateau with a small house. A local police man stands guard here. His duty is lonesome: he stays put for a week on the mountain and then is released by another officer. He invites us for tea, and we talk. His middle and last names are Salaam, ""peace"". Through a cracked screen on his phone he shows us pictures of the snow that he was in just two weeks ago. Only a trickle of people now pass each day, sometimes no one. A year ago there were dozens. These are tough times for tourism in Jordan. He seems content we're making it up the mountain and advises us an ancient path to take back. I give him my Abraham Path passport and he signs in Arabic: ""Jabal Haroun, 8 March 2015"". 7. The Bridge on FootFor long Jordanian tourism has struggled with the question of how to bridge the gap between its very solid safety record and security perceptions in the rest of the world. There is a group that is literally bridging that gap with their feet and they deserve more attention: a wide collective of Jordanian outdoor leaders and explorers have come together to create the continuous 600+ km Jordan Trail connecting the forested hills of Um Qais and Ajloun in the north to the spectacular deserts of Wadi Rum and Aqaba in the south. The Abraham Path follows and supports this route, of which Dana-Petra is one spectacular section. Jordan's hiking scene is homegrown with thousands of members and developing rapidly as its leaders are sewing together the best that the country has to offer in people, nature and cultural heritage. They are laying the basis for a new kind of tourism in the country: slower, fairer, more enriching. And they are drawing on a crowd that is more resilient to the frenzy of Middle East geopolitics than conventional tourism.On our way back from Mt. Haroun, we finally pass Petra's movie star icon of the Treasury, traditionally the first site visitors drop their jaws at. Opposite is a cliff with high up, at its very edge, a small tent. Here one of Petra's most amazing rock climbers hovers far above the tourist crowds. My friend David calls him ""the Mystic Bedouin"". When the Dana-Petra route was explored last year, the team took a winding footpath up the cliff and asked about any direct ways to the Treasury below him. His answer: ""if you open your mind there are many ways.""Photo credits in order of appearance: Stefan Szepesi, David Landis, Bashar Alaeddin (for Feynan Ecolodge), Dick Simon, Paul Gray (2x), Stefan Szepesi, Sumaya Agha. Dana to Petra can be walked in 4 (very experienced hikers only), 5, or 6 days, or parts of the trail for those with less time. The walk is possible both independently, and with guides and luggage transfers.

On top of the highest peak in the Petra region sits the Maqam of Haroun, Arabic for Aaron, the brother of Moses. It is visible from many of the cliffs nearer to Petra: a bright white dome on top of a distinctive mountain peak, a sacred place for the Abrahamic faiths. According to tradition Aaron was buried here. There are competing narratives on locations elsewhere in the Middle East, but pilgrims have climbed up here for centuries. It features Byzantine ruins, large water cisterns, and a set of beautiful steps up to the highest point of the Maqam. Just before our final ascent, we reach a plateau with a small house. A local police man stands guard here. His duty is lonesome: he stays put for a week on the mountain and then is released by another officer. He invites us for tea, and we talk. His middle and last names are Salaam, ""peace"". Through a cracked screen on his phone he shows us pictures of the snow that he was in just two weeks ago. Only a trickle of people now pass each day, sometimes no one. A year ago there were dozens. These are tough times for tourism in Jordan. He seems content we're making it up the mountain and advises us an ancient path to take back. I give him my Abraham Path passport and he signs in Arabic: ""Jabal Haroun, 8 March 2015"". 7. The Bridge on FootFor long Jordanian tourism has struggled with the question of how to bridge the gap between its very solid safety record and security perceptions in the rest of the world. There is a group that is literally bridging that gap with their feet and they deserve more attention: a wide collective of Jordanian outdoor leaders and explorers have come together to create the continuous 600+ km Jordan Trail connecting the forested hills of Um Qais and Ajloun in the north to the spectacular deserts of Wadi Rum and Aqaba in the south. The Abraham Path follows and supports this route, of which Dana-Petra is one spectacular section. Jordan's hiking scene is homegrown with thousands of members and developing rapidly as its leaders are sewing together the best that the country has to offer in people, nature and cultural heritage. They are laying the basis for a new kind of tourism in the country: slower, fairer, more enriching. And they are drawing on a crowd that is more resilient to the frenzy of Middle East geopolitics than conventional tourism.On our way back from Mt. Haroun, we finally pass Petra's movie star icon of the Treasury, traditionally the first site visitors drop their jaws at. Opposite is a cliff with high up, at its very edge, a small tent. Here one of Petra's most amazing rock climbers hovers far above the tourist crowds. My friend David calls him ""the Mystic Bedouin"". When the Dana-Petra route was explored last year, the team took a winding footpath up the cliff and asked about any direct ways to the Treasury below him. His answer: ""if you open your mind there are many ways.""Photo credits in order of appearance: Stefan Szepesi, David Landis, Bashar Alaeddin (for Feynan Ecolodge), Dick Simon, Paul Gray (2x), Stefan Szepesi, Sumaya Agha. Dana to Petra can be walked in 4 (very experienced hikers only), 5, or 6 days, or parts of the trail for those with less time. The walk is possible both independently, and with guides and luggage transfers. Options for lodging are varied between luxury ecolodges, Bedouin tents, wilderness camping and guesthouses/hotels in Petra.

The Justice Department on Wednesday cleared a white former Ferguson police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old, but also issued a scathing report calling for sweeping changes in city law enforcement practices it called discriminatory and unconstitutional. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae088e2200005700dada42.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ferguson will hold municipal elections April 7. The mayor and five of the six city councilpersons are white. Three are up for reelection. Since Michael Brown was gunned down by former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on August 9, the one loud refrain has repeatedly been how could a city where African-Americans make up the overwhelming majority of the population be policed by a nearly all-white police force, and governed by a nearly all-white city administration? The thought was that the Brown slaying angered and engaged so many thousands that it was almost a done deal that the first chance black residents got they'd jam the polls and totally revamp city government in Ferguson. The revamp meant the election of a majority black city council and mayor. This in turn could quickly mean the hiring of a black city manager and other top level administrators. This in turn could mean an overhaul of the police department to make diversity and reform a reality. Eight months after the Brown slaying, the April elections will put that thinking to the test. The early signs aren't good. In the nearly three month period between the day Brown was slain and October 8, a worse than anemic 204 eligible adults in Ferguson newly registered. A month later, less than half of the nearly 25,000 registered voters in Ferguson bothered to go to the polls in the mid-term elections. There was no breakdown by ethnicity of the number who actually did bother to vote. But given the general pattern of less voter participation by minorities in mid-term elections, and the far greater participation of older, conservative white voters, almost certainly, the turnout of black voters in Ferguson was abysmal. The one faint stir of optimism is the recall petition filed against the current mayor James Knowles. He has made it clear he won't step down. He moved quickly to pose as the change agent, held a high profile press conference, and has mobilized black support to beat back the recall effort. Despite his protestations and promises to jump hard on the reform train, he can't separate himself from a rigid, racially balkanized city governmental structure that has maintained iron-clad political control, and a racially polarizing police force and city administration.The reasons for the chronic past no shows of blacks from the Ferguson polls in part mirror the reasons for the persistent low minority voter turnout in local and national election in past years. The oft cited reasons are apathy, disinterest, GOP voter suppression, the sense that their vote won't change anything, that there's little difference between the two parties, and the inherent distrust of politicians. There's also the deep sense that the Democratic Party routinely takes the black vote for granted and that Democratic elected officials, no matter their color, offer few tangible programs and initiatives to deal with poverty, joblessness, the stratospheric black incarceration rates, and the gaping health and education racial disparities. Other than the well-publicized voter outreach and mobilization campaigns, Democrats launch in the immediate run up to a national election, there is no sustained effort to energize and engage, and keep engaged black voters. A standard rule in American politics is that politicians appeal to, and mobilize and champion programs and initiatives that are dear to the voters that are likely to vote for them and their constituents. The other part of that rule is that those voters and constituents are for the most part white, middle class and politically vocal. The poor, especially the black poor, have never fit that demographic. Ferguson has been a near textbook example of the cycle of neglect, and snub of blacks by a city council, mayor and city administration. African-Americans in Ferguson turn have read the political tea leafs and repaid that with their indifference and disinterest. Despite this entrenched pattern and past voting obstacles, there are compelling reasons for blacks in Ferguson to rush to barricades this time to vote. One is the prospect of a regime change at city hall and the police force. Another is they could move to dump the despicable near shakedown racket that city officials have run for years that criminalizes virtually the city entire black population. Police and the courts issued 16,000 arrest warrants in one year in Ferguson, a city of less than 25,000. Many of the warrants were for unpaid parking and traffic tickets. The offenders were arrested, and sometimes rearrested with the fines doubling and tripling. The fines enriched city coffers as well as the pockets of a few public officials. Another is there's no excuse. The only requirement to vote is to be age 18, a U.S. citizen and resident of Ferguson. A person can register at dozens of locations from city hall to churches, by mail, and at all DMV offices, and welfare offices. April 7 election can be a turning point for Ferguson. If it's not, and Ferguson stays Ferguson, then blacks have no one to blame but themselves.--Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

I'm here with the definitive list of men you'll find at what I like to call, ""Disneyland for those with dietary restrictions.""",2015-03-22,Shot of a young man walking in a grocery store with a basket full of fresh produce,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb600962600002d0182defa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kirstie Renae   Let me start out by saying I don't trust any grocery store that doesn't sell Oreos. I love my gluten, and I have never eaten a seaweed chip in my life. However, I can understand why Whole Foods Market is the place to be for millions of Americans. Their produce is absolutely gorgeous, the in-store cafe pumps out fantastically overpriced entrees and the unlimited variety of goat's milk products is without peer. But the best part of Whole Foods is the men. I mean, come on, ladies and gents. It's an utter smorgasbord of free-range, grass-fed boys in that place. If you're looking for a man, look no further. I'm here with the definitive list of men you'll find at what I like to call, ""Disneyland for those with dietary restrictions.""1. The Hipster GuyThe best place to search for this man is the bike rack in the front of the store, because he's surely trying to minimize his carbon footprint. He's got a burlap knapsack slung over his shoulder and reeks of weed. As evidenced by his bike's ""Shop Local"" sticker, we already know that his basket is full of locally-sourced products only. There are many subcategories of The Hipster Guy, ranging from the quirky artist to the yogi to the tech start-up entrepreneur, but all are sure of one thing: They are less mainstream, more cultured and WAY cooler than you are.2. The ""But It's From Whole Foods!"" GuyThis guy is a little too overweight, shiny and has a basket full of soda, frozen pizzas, cookies and Amy's frozen bean and cheese burritos. He has never set foot in the produce section and couldn't tell you the difference between arugula and romaine, but assures himself that spending $102 on eight items is worth it because it's from Whole Foods. So it's healthy... right?3. The Guy Who Hangs Out At The Whole Foods BarA special breed, this gent calls his buddies on a Wednesday night and says, ""Meet me at the bar! ...in Whole Foods."" His friends then throw on their cuffed jeans, slick back the tops of their hair (the sides are, of course, shaved) and head out for a wild night of drinking expensive IPAs in tiny cups. They might even get really crazy and walk around the store discussing the latest local brewery. At the end of the night, he purchases a couple specialty, hop-tastic six packs to take home and force onto his Shiner-drinking roommate. Finding this guy is easy, just follow the stench of wheat and barley.4. The ""Whatcha Buyin'?"" GuyI'm not sure why this dude even goes to the store, because he never buys anything. He is usually found strolling the aisles aimlessly, only stopping to try and start up discussions with cute women about the contents of their cart. The most dedicated version of this guy can be found dazzling the ladies at the bulk counter by showing off his vast knowledge of the usage, price and fair-trade practices of exclusive, imported cinnamon.5. The Guy Whose Wife Sent Him To Whole FoodsThis man is straight up lost. Unfortunately, he's already taken, but damn, his total confusion is SO cute. ""Excuse me, um. Is there a store directory?"" Sorry, buddy. It's a pretty special club here and you just have to be thrown to the wolves. ""But what the hell is sprouted grain bread? Why is it named after a Bible verse? And why is it not in the bread aisle?!?!"" Poor dude would never guess he should be looking for Ezekiel 4:9 in the frozen section. And frankly, watching his frustration grow is so adorable, we're not telling him any time soon.6. The Guy Who Swears He's Gluten IntolerantOne percent of the population has Celiac disease. This guy is totally not one of them. But gluten-free is in.7. The Lumberjack GuyPrep yourself, because this scruffy dude is hot as fresh maple syrup on a pancake. Donned in plaid and hair everywhere, he is basket-free and carries all his groceries in his sinewy arms, muscular as hell from chopping wood for his tiny home fireplace in the woods. Just kidding, he lives in a corporate apartment complex, but it's fun to look like the Brawny man and it drives the ladies crazy.8. The Fit GuyThree words: Protein. Powder. Supplements. This gentleman doesn't need meat. He gets all his sustenance from a bottle of chalky, pea-flavored powders mixed in his morning smoothie. While he waits for his $8 cold-pressed juice to be made at the juice bar, he shows off his abundance of underarm hair by flaunting a spandex tank top through the vitamin aisles. Don't bother approaching him if you're not wearing yoga pants and fresh ass Nikes.9. The Guy Who Stopped On His Way Home, Only To Be Sorely DisappointedThis everyman was on his way home from work and realized he needs a few things for dinner. Though he never normally shops at Whole Foods, he was in a hurry and just stopped in real quick. You will find him frustratingly strolling the confusing aisle layout looking for normal stuff, but much to his dismay, not finding it. Pressed for time and eager to leave the overwhelming smell of sandalwood that's wafting from the health and beauty section, he's a hard one to catch, so act quickly. He's surprisingly normal, pretty attractive and f*cking pissed off that there are no Oreos. Ladies and gentlemen, if you're looking for a man in Whole Foods to date, this guy is by far the only acceptable one.Originally posted on Literally, Darling an online magazine by and for twenty-something women, which features the personal, provocative, awkward, pop-filled and pressing issues of our gender and generation.
