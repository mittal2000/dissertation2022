But it's now confirmed to be a pair of star systems that are coming together.""Two separate galaxies have been gradually drawn together, attracted by gravity, and have collided,"" an ESA statement on the NASA website reveals. ""We now see them merging into a single structure.""The image appears to be ""chaotic"" because individual stars are being thrown out of their original orbits during collisions in the merger, the statement says. ""Eventually, this new galaxy will settle down into a stable shape, which may not resemble either of the two original galaxies.""Galaxy mergers are common, according to Space.com, with our own Milky Way set to merge with our neighboring Andromeda galaxy in around 4 billion years time.The Hubble Space Telescope is named after Edwin Powell Hubble, one of the great pioneers of modern astronomy, and launched in 1990 aboard the space shuttle Discovery. The first images sent back by the joint NASA/ESA project were blurry because of a faulty camera mirror. Spacewalking astronauts fixed the issue in 1993, and since then, the telescope has sent back hundreds of research images.Also on HuffPost:"

Chinese market chaos rooted in long-held but sporadically-acted-on fears of economic malaise, negative U.S. manufacturing data and instability in the Middle East combined to create an unfortunate grab bag of reasons for traders to sell.In the U.S., the S&P 500 index was down 1.5 percent Monday. In London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 2.4 percent, while the German Dax index was down 4.3 percent. The Japanese Nikkei index fell 3.06 percent.Those declines, while sharp, are relatively minor compared to the fall in Chinese markets that seems to have precipitated the global decline: The CSI 100 index fell 5 percent, triggering a temporary halt to trading under newly implemented rules intended to prop up the country's wobbly markets. When trading resumed, the market quickly fell another 2 percent and trading was suspended under the same rules, which limit a day's losses to 7 percent.Making matters worse -- or at least not providing much solace for traders -- are data released this morning showing that U.S. manufacturing continued to decline in December. Additionally, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran escalated over the weekend after the Saudi government cut ties with Tehran. The dispute began when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shiite cleric, the denomination of Islam most common in Iran.Also on HuffPost:"

Bundy has said that his faith led him to the refuge to defend Dwight and Steven Hammond, father and son ranchers sentenced to prison in 2012 for arson, then released and given new sentences last year.Bundy, a Mormon, is the the son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who famously had a legal battle with the government that ended in an armed confrontation in 2014.‚ÄúI got on my knees and I asked the Lord,‚Äù Ammon Bundy said in a video posted a day before the occupation, describing how he got the ""overwhelming urge"" to learn about the Hammonds.Bundy said he prayed: ""'Lord, if you want me to write something, then please help me clear my mind and show me what I should write.‚Äô And that‚Äôs what happened.‚ÄùNews reports on the occupation have cited Bundy's religious background, as well as a long history of government persecution of Mormons and conflict between the church and the government through the 19th century.Church officials, who often respond to news related to the church via their MormonNewsroom.org website, released the statement after receiving inquiries about the Oregon occupation. The church's full statement:While the disagreement occurring in Oregon about the use of federal lands is not a Church matter, Church leaders strongly condemn the armed seizure of the facility and are deeply troubled by the reports that those who have seized the facility suggest that they are doing so based on scriptural principles.

9,TECH,Why Refrigerators Should Stay Forever Dumb,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/samsung-smart-fridge_us_568a80cee4b0b958f65c19f0,"""Smart"" fridges are becoming more common, but there are a few big problems.",2016-01-04,A first-generation Apple TV. You might also call it a worthless hockey puck if you're interested in using the YouTube app.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568ac55d190000380178afda.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fridge, meet tablet.Samsung on Sunday unveiled via its Korean website a new refrigerator that will connect to the Internet. It looks like someone welded a gargantuan iPad onto the front door, and it reportedly will let people access a list of their food from any smartphone, get alerts when items are expiring, listen to music via the fridge itself, turn off Internet-connected lightbulbs elsewhere in the house and more. There are a lot of reasons to roll your eyes at this -- and basically any smart device -- but they may not be the ones you expect. The biggest problem isn't the hardware -- ridiculous as it may look -- but the software. How often do you upgrade your fridge? Maybe every 13 years if you follow established guidelines. How often do apps update? Much more often than that, obviously.If you purchase a smart device, be it a fridge or an Apple TV, you can rest assured that it will become obsolete, not necessarily because its internal parts rust or break down, but because apps stop working as intended. Take for example the YouTube app. Last year, Google stopped supporting an old version that ran on devices manufactured before 2013, like some models of Apple TV and certain Blu-ray players. Owners of the oldest devices -- which probably worked just fine otherwise -- lost the ability to use an app because Google wanted to focus on a more modern version.Believe it or not, a similar thing has already happened on a Samsung smart fridge. In 2014, the Samsung RF4289HARS lost the ability to connect to the Google Calendar app unless users upgraded to a more recent version. You can take a second and laugh about this: People needed to update the software on their refrigerators in order to see their calendars.Motherboard's Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai pointed out the absurdity of the situation in a post last month.It's actually not so funny, though, when you consider how software updates are used to engineer sales. That's one way Apple gets people to buy new iPhones: A new software update rolls around, you install it on an old device; it runs slowly, you buy an upgrade. Or, you never update your device's software, your apps stop working, and you finally cave and buy a new gadget.Perhaps worst of all, Internet-connected devices are also vulnerable to hacks. Last year, researchers found that an older model of Samsung's smart fridge put a user's Gmail information at risk.Without putting too fine a point on it, these were never problems with VCRs or ""classic"" fridges. (Duh.)The advent of Samsung's new refrigerator, which is designed to work with other Internet-connected devices in your home, could be an opportunity for reflection. True, smart fridges have been punching bags for years, but critics tend to focus on a couple of things: The fridges are expensive, and it seems ridiculous to mirror your smartphone on the same thing that keeps your yogurt frosty.But criticizing the appliance simply because it connects to the Internet and has a screen isn't really fair. We live in a world where people wear smartwatches to avoid the inconvenience of picking their phones up. People put little devices in their pockets to keep track of how much they're walking. An experimental gizmo from last year used heart rate data to track how much people like their friends.You could make the argument that all of this junk is dumb on the basis that no one really ""needs"" to quantify their life so obsessively. Humans exercised before Fitbit told them to and communicated with one another before the Apple Watch made text messages wrist-ready. That argument ignores the basic fact that people apparently want these devices. There's enough demand that a recent report from Gartner, a tech research firm, predicts that 6.4 billion Internet-connected devices will be used worldwide in 2016.An influx of Internet-connected devices could be a really good thing. In fairness to the smart fridge, well-timed updates about food could prevent waste -- a clear benefit that does a lot to justify the device's existence. Smart cars could save people money, reduce emissions and decongest our roadways. Thermostats that talk to your phone could help you use energy responsibly. Online sensors on public garbage cans could stop dump trucks from taking needless trips.But consumers, at least, have a lot to think about when it comes to shopping for these devices. It appears that they can't yet be confident that whatever they purchase now will even be fully functional a few years down the line. And when we're talking about appliances that cost several thousand dollars -- well, you can do the math on whether or not that makes sense."

""My hands and my bum didn't even know that.""Her mother, Nicole Langmead, said she had waited outside with her three children for the Devon restroom to clear for some time.""We were just about to give up when these two girls came out of the bathroom laughing,"" Langmead told the Exeter Express and Echo. ""I didn't think too much of it and Kaya went into the toilet.""When her daughter returned, she was in tears.""She said something had hurt her bum, but it never crossed my mind it would be glue,"" her outraged mother told the Mirror. ""I thought maybe the seat had moved or something. But when we checked it over, there was glue everywhere.""When she checked her daughter she found the skin around the backs of her legs and bottom were extremely red and sore.They notified the restaurant's staff who worked to comfort Kaya -- giving her a balloon. Cornwall police were also notified, Langmead said.Police said they‚Äôre now hoping to speak with the two girls, described as aged 16-to-18, one with long blonde hair and the other with shoulder length brown hair.Super-gluing someone to a toilet seat may sound like a harmless prank to some, but it can leave the victims suffering extreme injuries.In 2013, first responders had to remove a Georgia woman from a Home Depot restroom after she became glued to a toilet seat. Nearly two weeks later, she said she was still barely able to sit up from her injuries.In 2012, a woman had to have a toilet seat removed from her body in a hospital's emergency room after sitting on a sticky seat in a Walmart bathroom.Also on HuffPost:"

14,COLLEGE,What Three College Presidents Learned From Campus Racism Protests,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-presidents-campus-racism-protests_us_568a89a0e4b0b958f65c1f1a,"Students aren't naively demanding that colleges make the world perfect, these leaders say.",2016-01-04,"Left to right: Pomona College President David Oxtoby, Muhlenberg College President John Williams, Jr., Davidson College President Carol Quillen. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568ade711600000001eb9f12.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"College presidents can't solve all of society's problems, but they do have a responsibility to join student activists in efforts to address systemic racial bias. That was one common sentiment that emerged when The Huffington Post asked three presidents of private liberal arts colleges -- Pomona College's David Oxtoby, Muhlenberg College's John Williams Jr. and Davidson College's Carol Quillen -- what they have learned from recent student activism around race. These presidents' campuses have seen students protest as part of the Black Lives Matter movement -- students at all three schools held demonstrations in 2014 over the failure to indict the police officers who killed Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York, both unarmed black men.None of these demonstrations rivaled the widely covered protests at the University of Missouri or Yale University, but the college leaders are keenly paying attention nonetheless.Shortly after the Mizzou protests in November 2015, anti-black comments were posted on Muhlenberg's Yik Yak message board. In response, Williams' administration organized a town hall about diversity, equality and marginalization on the school's Allentown, Pennsylvania, campus. More than 900 students -- about 40 percent of the student body -- attended the event.Williams said he made the call to hold the town hall within just a few hours of the Yik Yak postings. ""I have the app right on my phone, I monitor Yik Yak at our college,"" he noted.Williams wanted to use the town hall to show that the school doesn't tolerate offensive speech against blacks any more than it tolerates slurs against, say, Jewish people.""That's what the black students and students of color are looking for,"" he said. ""They're [not] looking for this to be a place that nobody ever does anything or says anything racist, but when somebody does, their friends or everyone else around them says, 'Hey dude, that's not what we're about. That's not who we are,' as opposed to silently putting your head down and being a silent bystander.""The Muhlenberg president acknowledged that student activism against racism can sometimes be counterproductive, but said that's because students are young and still learning how to air their grievances. Rather, he finds it encouraging that students are engaged on these issues and unwilling to tolerate racism patiently.""If you're a racist at heart, I can't throw a switch and change your heart, but what I can do is create a culture and creating a culture takes time,"" Williams said. ""Students are often very impatient because they've got a time window of four years, and if you don't change it during the time that they're there, it's like the tree that fell in the forest ... I understand that. But what I'm talking about is creating a culture where people who come to Muhlenberg with racist attitudes don't feel comfortable -- they feel uncomfortable.""Quillen, president of Davidson in North Carolina, said she's learned that student protesters don't expect colleges to fix all social ills. ""I don't think they're saying 'Fix my problem,' or 'My feelings are hurt, you need to tell the person to say sorry,'"" she said. ""I think they're saying, 'You make claims about what you believe in and we would like you to live in a way that reflects your values, that's what you ask us to do.' That's fair enough.""""When the students are looking to the institution,"" she added, ""some of what they're doing is saying, 'Do your job.' And your job isn't telling that other student to shut up; your job is to give [them] what [they] need to go from this experience of marginalization and pain to a political position. That's what education does, and insofar as we're not doing that for them, we need to do that better. We need to help them make that journey from, 'I don't feel like I belong here' to 'OK, I don't feel like I belong here, I know I deserve to be here, what about this institution is making me feel that way? And what do we need to change that?'""Pomona's Oxtoby doesn't feel like it's unfair to expect college presidents to comment when a racist incident takes place on campus.""I wouldn't say 'dragged in' [to comment], I would say 'invited in,'"" Oxtoby said. ""I want to be part of that conversation. I would much rather be part of it than have everything happening and things going back and forth, and I'm just standing on the side ... Being engaged in the issues of the day is what we want our students to be doing and I want to be a model in that.""Pomona is part of the Claremont Colleges consortium in California, which consists of five distinct institutions that essentially share a physical campus and work closely together. At Claremont McKenna College, another school in the consortium, students protesters successfully pushed a dean to resign, in part because she suggested to a Latina student that minority students ""don't fit our CMC mold."" Other students counter-protested, disagreeing that the dean should have to resign.But Oxtoby pointed out that it was more than a single remark that made students upset.""There are lots of things going on in the world around them and it may sound like they're focusing on this one little thing,"" he said. ""Well, the reason they're focusing on this little thing is that they can't do anything about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is going to do what he does ... and the students will have no effect on that. And the students are saying 'How can I have an effect?' So the national situation is affecting what happens, and people don't always make those connections.""Pomona College students presented their president with a list of demands in November, asking for more resources for minority and LGBTQ groups and for mental health care, as well as for increased diversity among faculty and staff. Oxtoby views these lists of demands as a ""cry for help"" that college leaders should take seriously.""I hear people say, 'Students are really selfish these days."" Well, maybe there's a little bit of that,"" he said. ""But I see students really caring about each other. If one of them is hurting, if they have something that's happened to them, you feel it, you're aware of it, and you join them.""______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and is based in New York.

That's called basic humanity,"" Cuomo said during an interview on New York City news channel NY1.New York and other big U.S. cities have long wrestled with the dilemma of dealing with homeless people who refuse to be taken to shelters, even in the most bitter cold. Many of them fear falling victim to crime in the shelters.The order also requires shelters to extend hours of operation to ensure that homeless people can stay inside whenever there is ""inclement winter weather which can cause hypothermia, serious injury and death.""Municipalities throughout the state currently employ a wide range of policies to address homelessness. According to the order, state law allows for the involuntary placement of homeless individuals so they do not harm themselves or others.Officials at the Coalition for the Homeless advocacy group in New York City could not be immediately reached for comment.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office said it supported the intent of the order, but added that Cuomo will need to pass a law to force homeless individuals into shelters, according to a statement given to the New York Times.Cuomo said during an interview with news radio station WCBS-AM that he is prepared to defend the order's constitutionality in court.According to the order, more than 77,000 emergency shelter beds are available for homeless single adults, families and unaccompanied youth in the state.More than 80,000 homeless individuals live in the state, according to a 2015 report by the National Alliance to End Homelessness.The order said the state will assist local agencies if they lack the necessary resources.(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Frank McGurty, Jonathan Oatis and Dan Grebler)Also on HuffPost:"

I‚Äôve been through adversity my whole life.""",2016-01-04,"Sarver sits courtside as the Suns take on the Los Angeles Clippers on Jan. 24, 2013, in Phoenix, Arizona.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568aeb971600000001eb9f37.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tensions are surging between the Phoenix Suns and power forward Markieff Morris as the franchise struggles for success on the court while the big man struggles to bottle his frustration over basically everything involving the team. That frustration began to bubble when brother Marcus was traded from the club last July. And it finally boiled over just days before Christmas, when Morris threw a towel at dead-man-walking head coach Jeff Hornacek during a matchup against the Denver Nuggets.According to Suns owner Robert Sarver, Morris‚Äô recent challenges are symptoms of a disease that has affected nearly his entire generation. This disease is the Internet, obviously, and per Sarver, such technology is the reason why Morris and his millennial teammates have been ill-equipped to deal with the challenges the 12-25 squad has faced this season.‚ÄúMy whole view of the millennial culture is that they have a tough time dealing with setbacks, and Markieff Morris is the perfect example,‚Äù Sarver told the Arizona Republic. ‚ÄúHe had a setback with his brother in the offseason and he can‚Äôt seem to recover from it.""‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the technology or the instant gratification of being online. But the other thing is, I‚Äôm not a fan of social media,"" Sarver continued. ""I tell my kids it‚Äôs like Fantasy Land. The only thing people put online are good things that happen to them, or things they make up. And it creates unrealistic expectations. We‚Äôve had a number of setbacks this year that have taken their toll on us, and we haven‚Äôt been resilient.‚ÄùAs USA Today pointed out, Sarver‚Äôs comments are, well, somewhat hypocritical, considering that the man has a personal Twitter account. But, when asked about Sarver‚Äôs remarks on Monday, Morris refused to further engage the owner in this bizarre battle of one-on-one. Instead, he countered with a point that is hard to argue with. ‚ÄúWhatever he said is whatever he said. I don‚Äôt get into that stuff,‚Äù Morris said. ‚ÄúWhen adversity comes, you definitely have to fight through it.""And then, the kicker: ""I‚Äôm from Philly. I‚Äôve been through adversity my whole life. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got to say about that.‚ÄùMorris‚Äô response makes the clear the irony behind Sarver‚Äôs attack. Morris learned to play basketball in a world where hearing gunfire was the norm, in a neighborhood on the north side of Philadelphia where street violence was considered typical. Sarver, meanwhile, has earned his living largely by buying, selling and founding banks -- and as such, has no right to publicly doubt the inner strength of the men that don the Phoenix uniform every night.Sure, as team owner Sarver certainly has the right to question the resolution of his team -- but he crossed a line when he questioned the resilience of Morris and the resolve of an entire generation. Growing up the son of a businessman in Tucson, Arizona, is inconceivably different than honing your craft on the streets of Philly -- and it‚Äôs a difference that was made all the more clear by the blanket statement Sarver gave this weekend, when he brushed aside the hardships this player has faced, treating the big man like an ill-behaved schoolboy, while all the while cashing in on Morris‚Äô talent whenever he takes the floor.Also on HuffPost: "

She said their ‚Äúnational treasure‚Äù was described as having ‚Äútoo much bare skin or sexual undertones,‚Äù local news site Ekstra Bladet reports.Facebook‚Äôs community standards policies prohibit many instances of nudity out of respect for some audiences‚Äô sensitivity, according to their website.They do, however, allow photos of ‚Äúpaintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures.‚Äù They also allow photos of women breastfeeding and post-mastectomy scarring.According to Gjerskov, contrary to the statue's nudity being an exception according to these rules, her photo was rejected.That decision was later reversed, she wrote on her Facebook wall, though her photo was still removed from her blog on Danish public news station TV2 because of yet another red flag: it being a potential copyright violation.""It turns out that you can't take photos [of the artwork] ... without generous payment to the artist's heirs. It's the law -- which Parliament adopted,‚Äù Gjerskov wrote.According to local reports, when the statue celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2013, local media opted to describe the statue rather than show its picture because of this very copyright.The Local reported that the family of the artwork‚Äôs sculptor, Edvard Eriksen, will send Danish media outlets a large bill if they use a photo of his statue.‚ÄúRather than illustrate the photo with a beautiful picture of the sculpture -- thousands of which can be found all over the Internet -- we chose a photo in which the famous landmark was surrounded by tourists and thus not the main focus of the image,‚Äù the outlet explained.Despite the risks and limitations, the statue is snapped more than 5 million times each year, according to the city‚Äôs tourism bureau, which considers the statue ‚Äì based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale -- a city icon.Also on HuffPost:"

Es Sider and nearby Ras Lanuf oil ports, between Sirte and Benghazi on coast, have been shut for a year.Islamic State has taken advantage the security vacuum to grab territory and are threatening to advance from Sirte, which it controls. So far the group has failed to take control of any Libyan oil installations but has done so in Syria.The group said it had attacked Es Sider after taking the nearby town of Ben Jawad. However, there was no independent confirmation of its capture.Es Sider is protected by Ibrahim al-Jathran's Petrol Facilities Guard, which has backed the internationally recognized government based in the city of Benghazi in the east, but is also fighting other forces supporting that government.The United Nations has been trying to win support for a deal brokered in Morocco last month to create a national unity government for Libya.Separately on Monday, a plane targeting militant groups in the eastern city of Benghazi was shot down, though the pilot ejected, senior army commander Fadel al-Hassi told Reuters.Militias allied to the Benghazi government have been battling insurgents based in the city for months.Also on HuffPost:"

The auto giant on Monday announced a deal with Lyft -- the chief U.S. rival to ride-hailing service Uber -- to develop a network of self-driving cars that can be summoned via an app.""We see the future of mobility as connected, seamless and autonomous,"" Dan Ammann, GM president, said in a statement. ""With GM and Lyft working together, we believe we can successfully implement the vision more rapidly.""This may mark the most aggressive move yet by any traditional automaker into the battle to perfect autonomous vehicles.Daimler rolled out designs for a self-driving long-haul truck in May, two months after showing off its sleek Mercedes-Benz concept car (also driverless) around San Francisco. In July, the University of Michigan opened a fake town, where major car companies -- including Ford, Toyota and GM -- can test their autonomous software and vehicles. Lexus, Toyota's luxury division, plans to launch a self-driving feature by 2020. Tech companies, by contrast, have made more ambitious strides. Cash-flush Uber eviscerated Carnegie Mellon University's esteemed robotics department earlier this year, poaching nearly everyone -- including the director -- to develop the firm's self-driving technology. In November, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk said that beefing up the electric carmaker's self-driving program was ""a super high priority."" And all along, Google has been testing its bug-like autonomous vehicles on the streets of Mountain View, California.Traditional automakers' reluctance to make bold moves is linked to the fact that self-driving technology could fundamentally undermine the auto industry's core business model: selling cars to people. A driver uses a car only 5 percent of the time the vehicle is owned or leased, according to research by Donald Shoup, a professor with the University of California at Los Angeles. This means that, for the other 95 percent of the time, the vehicle remains parked. Consider that -- between insurance, fuel, tires and other expenses -- it costs on average $8,698 per year to own and operate a vehicle in the United States, according to a survey by the automotive services nonprofit AAA. In April, Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas published a provocative chart predicting that, eventually, only rich people would buy their own vehicles, and that everyone else would rely on Uber-like fleets of self-driving cars to get from place to place. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft may be luxuries now, but by eliminating the cost of a human driver, rates per mile would drop dramatically.That could potentially make calling a private car cheaper than a ride on the subway. This doesn't mean GM is getting out of the car-selling business. More cars than ever before were sold in the U.S. last year, and a surge in Chinese purchases drove global sales to a record high. In the short term, the GM-Lyft deal also means that the automaker's vehicles will be the go-to choice for Lyft drivers who rent service cars, and it opens the door to special offerings for GM and Lyft customers.But most of all, GM can now say it has skin in a game that the traditional industry may be losing. ""Working with GM, Lyft will continue to unlock new transportation experiences that bring positive change to our daily lives,"" Lyft President John Zimmer said in a statement. ""Together we will build a better future by redefining traditional car ownership."" "

It also falls a day before the fifth anniversary of the shooting of former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords (D) at a constituent meeting outside a supermarket in Tucson. According to CNN, the president will discuss gun violence and take questions from the audience. The event follows news that Obama is readying executive actions that would expand background checks on gun sales. The move could come as early as next week, or be timed to coincide with the State of the Union address on Jan. 12.Obama has repeatedly expressed frustration with Congress and its reluctance to take steps to curb gun violence. In December, after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, Obama again urged lawmakers to take action.""We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world,"" he said.The reported executive actions are most likely to face fierce resistance from Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail. Real estate mogul Donald Trump, the GOP front-runner in the race for the White House, promised he would ""unsign"" the actions if he were elected president.Also on HuffPost:"
