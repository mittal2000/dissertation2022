Hopes for avoiding the ""fiscal cliff"" that threatens the U.S. economy fell Friday after fighting among congressional Republicans cast doubt on whether any deal reached with President Barack Obama could win approval ahead of automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts kick in Jan. 1.

""This keeps us out of recession for now,"" said Menzie Chinn, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.The contours of the deal suggest that roughly one-third of the scheduled fiscal tightening could still take place, said Brett Ryan, an economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.That is in line with what many financial firms on Wall Street and around the world have been expecting, suggesting forecasts for economic growth of around 1.9 percent for 2013 would likely hold.At midnight Monday, low tax rates enacted under then-President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 expired. If the House agrees with the Senate - and there remained considerable doubt on that score - the new rates would be extended retroactively.Otherwise, together with other planned tax hikes, the average household would pay an estimated $3,500 more in taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank. Budget experts expect the economy would take a hit as families cut back on spending.Provisions in the Senate bill would avoid scheduled cuts to jobless benefits and to payments to doctors under a federal health insurance program. AUSTERITY'S BITELike the consensus of economists from Wall Street and beyond, Deutsche Bank has been forecasting enough fiscal drag to hold back growth to roughly 1.9 percent in 2013. Ryan said the details of the deal appeared to support that forecast.That would be much better than the 0.5 percent contraction predicted by the Congressional Budget Office if the entirety of the fiscal cliff took hold, but it would fall short of what is needed to quickly heal the labor market, which is still smarting from the 2007-09 recession.""We continue to anticipate a significant economic slowdown at the start of the year in response to fiscal drag and a contentious fiscal debate,"" economists at Nomura said in a research note.In particular, analysts say financial markets are likely to remain on tenterhooks until Congress raises the nation's $16.4 trillion debt ceiling, which the U.S. Treasury confirmed had been reached on Monday.While the Bush tax cuts would be made permanent for many Americans under the budget deal, a two-year-long payroll tax holiday enacted to give the economy an extra boost would expire. The Tax Policy Center estimates this could push the average household tax bill up by about $700 next year.The suspension of spending cuts sets up a smaller fiscal cliff later in the year which still could be enough to send the economy into recession, said Chinn.He warned that ongoing worries about the possibility of recession could keep businesses from investing, which would hinder economic growth.""You retain the uncertainty,"" Chinn said.

There have been all sorts of proposals to create international regulations, including some that surfaced at a recent United Nations World Conference on International Telecommunications, (WCIT) where some countries advocated increased governmental and international control, which Ambassador Terry Kramer, the U.S.'s top representative, called an ""invasive approach of governments in managing the internet, in managing the content that goes via the internet, what people are looking at, what they're saying, et cetera.""Despite efforts to exert control, the Internet, in most parts of the world, remains pretty free and open and a lot of people, -- myself included -- want to keep it that way.But that doesn't mean that stakeholders -- individuals, groups, companies and governments too -- shouldn't take responsibility over their own behavior.

The 18-member crew had already been evacuated by the Coast Guard on Saturday because of risks from the storm.With winds reported at up to 60 miles (100 km) an hour and Gulf of Alaska seas of up to 35 feet (11 m), responders were unable to keep the ship from grounding, the Coast Guard said.Sean Churchfield, operations manager for Shell Alaska, could not explain why the Kulluk had been caught in the weather. ""I can't give you a specific answer, but I do not believe we would want to tow it in these sorts of conditions.""The rig was upright and rocking with a slow motion but stable, and Churchfield said there was still plenty of work to bring the incident to a safe conclusion.The leading Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives' Natural Resources Committee, Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, said the incident and others illustrated the perils of drilling offshore in the area.""Oil companies cannot currently drill safely in the foreboding conditions of the Arctic, and drilling expansion could prove disastrous for this sensitive environment,"" he said. ""TRULY CHALLENGING""Susan Childs, emergency incident commander for Shell, believed that a significant spill was unlikely because of the Kulluk's design, with diesel fuel tanks isolated in the center of the vessel and encased in very heavy steel.Shell is waiting for weather to moderate to begin a complete assessment of the Kulluk.The Anglo-Dutch company's drilling plans had already alarmed environmentalists and locals, who believe the program threatens a fragile region.""Shell and its contractors are no match for Alaska's weather and sea conditions either during drilling operations or during transit,"" Lois Epstein, Arctic program director for The Wilderness Society, said in an email, calling for an end to Shell's ""costly drilling experiment in the Arctic Ocean.""Rick Steiner, a former University of Alaska marine biology professor and an Alaska environmental activist, said the risks of going through the Gulf of Alaska were underestimated, though companies had to move equipment that way to reach Arctic waters.Unlike Prince William Sound, where a system with 11 powerful escort and rescue tugs was established after the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Island region has no high-powered tugs, he said.A similar accident could happen with any of the 20 large ships heading through the area every day on the cargo route between Asia and North America, he said, though he faulted Shell for failing to anchor the drillship days ago when there was notice that high winds were coming.""Like every disaster, this is a cascade of human error and mechanical failures,"" Steiner said.BEDEVILLEDThe trouble began on Friday, when the ship towing the Kulluk had a mechanical failure and lost its connection. That ship, the Aiviq, was reattached early on Monday along with a tug sent by the operator of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. But the Aiviq lost its link again on Monday afternoon, and the tug guided the Kulluk to where a grounding would have the least environmental impact.The nearest community is Old Harbor, a Native Alutiiq village with 208 residents on the south side of Kodiak Island.The Kulluk, which was being taken to Seattle for the off season, was used by Shell in September and October to drill a prospect in the Beaufort Sea. Built in 1983, it had been slated to be scrapped before Shell bought it in 2005. The company has spent $292 million since then to upgrade the vessel.Shell's Arctic campaign has been bedevilled by problems. A second drillship, the Noble Discoverer, was briefly detained in December by the Coast Guard in Seward, Alaska, because of safety concerns. A mandatory oil-containment barge, the Arctic Challenger, failed for months to meet Coast Guard requirements for seaworthiness and a ship mishap resulted in damage to a critical piece of equipment intended to cap a blown well."

Like the guy in seat 26B just in front of me right now on a flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles, who is probably a nice guy on the ground. But put him on a plane, and shortly after takeoff, he jams his seat into my knees without so much as an apology.Jerk.It's the flight attendant who kicked me out of the row of empty seats in the back of the plane, after I moved there to avoid the wedge. He did it with a stern, ""You're gonna have to get out of this seat, now. These are blocked for the crew."" It wasn't the passive-aggressive way he phrased it as much as it was the tone -- he might as well have been saying, ""It's a federal offense to interfere with the flight crew.""Jerk.It's the fellow passenger who almost ran over me as I was disembarking, swearing under her breath because I wasn't moving fast enough. I know I wasn't moving fast enough. I had to help my three kids off the plane and lift their luggage out of the overhead compartments.It doesn't make any difference how well you're treated or how much you're abused. In the end, we all turn into jerks.I've spoken with psychologists about this phenomenon, and they tell me that there's something about travel that just makes us insufferable. It is, they speculate, the fact that when we go somewhere, we are away from the social restraints that make us behave -- our friends, family and community. It could also be the fact that we know we'll never see the people we meet again. So we treat them like props in a movie, as if they are not real.But they are. I can hardly read my computer screen now because the jerk in 26B had to lean all the way back and because the idiots who installed these seats only gave me 31 inches of seat pitch.I beg to differ with the experts. I don't think we turn into boorish imbeciles just because we're away from home, although that may be a contributing factor. I think it's cause and effect, and on two levels. It's travel companies slowly removing many of the services and amenities that made travel tolerable, on the one hand. I offer an almost daily account of these indignities on my consumer advocacy blog.It's a little bit like taking a well-behaved dog, locking him in a cage, depriving him of food and taunting him.He'll turn mean, eventually.But how does that explain the childish behavior of the entitled elites -- you know, the ones who lurk on sites like Flyertalk or one of the mileage blogs littered with scammy affiliate links? Opposite problem there: Like the children of dictators, these super-platinum elites are given everything that the travel companies took away from us, the long-suffering passengers in the back of the aircraft.While we have no room to move in steerage, they complain when their lie-flat sleeper seat doesn't recline all the way. They're told, ""You're more special than everyone else, you should expect the world."" The result is a cabin full of spoiled babies who fire off complaint letters to their airline when the Chardonnay isn't chilled to the right temperature.They believe they are God's gift to travel, but they are not. They are jerks.You don't have to be. If you're lucky enough to sit in a first-class seat, be grateful. Thank your employer, who allowed you to collect enough miles for the upgrade. Thank the flight attendant who has to put up with the other whiners in the forward cabin. Thank a member of the armed services who fought so you could live in a free country where you can afford to buy that upgrade.Take nothing for granted, because when you stop traveling for business, your elite status will expire -- and so will your miles -- and then you will email me for help getting your status restored.If you're sitting in the bleacher seats or staying in a standard room, you don't have to behave like a jerk, either. Don't take it out on your fellow passengers and guests. It's not their fault that you're being tortured. Instead, stand up and let the travel company know you won't be treated like cattle. Fly on airlines and stay in hotels that treat you like a person.They do exist.You have it in you to end the incivility that's made travel a ridiculously bad experience. Do something. Now."

""Instead, everyone's acting like, 'I've got mine.'""Or, ""Get out of my way."" The Saturday before Christmas, I was waiting for an opening to make a turn at a five-way intersection less than a mile from my house. It's a tricky left and, with my 5-year-old granddaughter buckled into the back seat, I waited for a clear opening. But my caution proved dangerous in its own right. First one, then a second car sped around me on the right and then turned left directly in front of me. It was lucky I saw them.For the record, I'm not Grandpa Geezer behind the wheel. I grew up near New York City.The next day we took our granddaughter, Devon, to Boston's renowned Museum of Science. We thought we'd check out the IMAX movie special, Santa vs. the Snowman. The theatre was crowded and we asked a woman sitting with two kids whether she might move one seat to the right so we could have three seats to her left. ""No, we want to sit in the middle,"" she said.Not a problem. We slid into the row behind. A few minutes later, the usher asked everyone to fill in empty seats to accommodate the crowd. The same woman responded by putting her purse on the seat to her left. She wanted to keep seats empty on both sides. Happy holidays.One hint, I suspect, of what's fueling our societal aggressiveness became evident in the film that followed. The movie -- a holiday special for kids in an award-winning science museum -- was about a war between Santa and a snowman who wanted to usurp his status as deliverer of toys. It did have a happy ending. But in between, Santa, the Snowman and their minions fired all kinds of cool weapons at each other, knocking off each other's armies. Ha-ha-ha. Ho-ho-ho. Great timing after Newtown. America at its finest.Don't get me wrong. I'm not blaming violence -- in video games, in movies and with real guns -- for all of society's edge, all of our bad behavior. A more widespread problem may be today's all-wired, all-the-time world, which plays a big part in the decline of basic manners -- a nod, a smile, an acknowledgment of someone else's humanity or at least their presence.I teach at a creative and lively college of communication and the arts in the center of Boston. You'd never know that, however, from riding the elevators in my building. These are, shall we say, ""intimate;"" six people can cram in, inches apart. Yet on most elevator rides, no one talks, no one smiles, no one makes eye contact -- with anything, that is, but their cell phones. Those students not texting (and some who are) have in ear buds. Heaven forbid that they -- we -- should interact in any fashion with the people inches away.Rudeness, today, has become hip, too, in meetings and classrooms. From what I can tell, carrying iPads into meetings as much an excuse to check out of the conversation as to streamline work. I've seen people reading and writing email at meetings with the college's top administrators. This kind of ""I'm in my world"" attitude carries into the classroom, too.For the past two or three years, I've had to go to great lengths to patrol the computer labs in which I teach to get students off their keyboards and into the conversation. It would be nice if I could just ask once when, for example, we're critiquing a classmate's story. It would be, but it just doesn't work. Touching those keys is like scratching an itch for some.Again. I'm not Grandpa Geezer. I won my college's teaching award five years ago. And even if I am rapidly becoming a dinosaur (wait, he's at the science museum), it's not cool for students to ignore their peers -- or me, for that matter.When we move through life oblivious of others, everyone loses. It helps create the kind of environment in which a wingnut from the NRA can stand up and suggest we should put armed guards at every elementary school and in which our elected representatives do damned little other than attack those in the other party. Or perhaps all these scrooges are just more causes of our widespread societal malaise.Here's what I suggest. If our leaders can't model civil and civic behavior, let's you and I try. Let's start small. The next time someone coming toward you is trying to turn left on a yellow light, stop your car. Don't run the red, as someone did Friday to me with both grandchildren in the back seat. When you enter a building, consider holding the door for the person behind you. Try saying good morning to someone standing beside you in an elevator. And if you feel compelled to be all-wired, all-the-time, don't use the technology as a weapon to shut off yourself off to those trying to engage you.They're small steps, but give them a try. You just might feel less alienated and less angry in 2013."

Lead Editor for Conan O'Brien",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/child-surgery_us_5b9cac98e4b03a1dcc80c744,Being a special needs dad has taught me to expect the unexpected in terms of what life is going to throw out at you and your child.,2012-12-31,Donating blood at CHLA while we wait for the surgery to be done,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-12-31-donate.jpg,"Being a special needs dad has taught me to expect the unexpected in terms of what life is going to throw out at you and your child. This year, rather than plan a trip to the South to visit the in-laws or an excursion to Disneyland, we planned a six-hour orthopedic surgery at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Mainly, we scheduled the surgery for this time so that I would have two weeks off of work to help out. At 2, my daughter Elliot doesn't understand the concept of Christmas, anyway. Ever since we first heard of this surgery 1.5 years ago, we have been anxiously awaiting the day Elliot could have it. Our hope is that the procedure will be a huge step forward (pun intended) towards her walking independently one day. The six-hour surgery was a success and recovery has been slow and steady. Six hours is a long time to let your mind wander. Like most people these days, I used my smartphone to pass a lot of the time. There are some things that I learned from that experience that I would like to share with you in case you ever have to go through something similar or if you know someone who will.I'm not the biggest fan of Facebook. I mostly have a page to share photos and videos of my daughter with her grandparents. Facebook's number one strength for us is being able to send out a update to a number of family members quickly. But, we also benefit from the support system we have found on Facebook with families that are going through similar challenges.Starting bright and early for Elliot's 8 a.m. surgery, my wife and I began posting regular updates to let all our friends and family know what was going on. I learned that while posting periodic status updates about the procedure is theoretically a good idea, it becomes messy in execution. One of the problems is caused by Facebook's newsfeed display. So let's say I post three status updates during the procedure:a. two hours left in surgery b. one hour left in surgery c. waiting for an updateBased on the ""likes"" or the comments these statuses are receiving, their order may not stay the same on some Facebook users newsfeeds because the default sorting method of Facebook goes by ""Top Stories.""When my daughter had to have a blood transfusion in the middle of the night, my wife updated her status to let everyone know this was happening. A day later, after someone made a new comment to that status, it jumped back to the top of my mother-in-law's newsfeed based on the new comment. This, in turn, led my mother-in-law to believe that Elliot was receiving yet another blood transfusion. You can see how it can all get confusing, especially for those who are not Facebook savvy. As I mentioned before, we are a part of a large support system on Facebook. A number of our friends and family posted status updates asking for prayers for my daughter, which was a very thoughtful thing to do. In many of these posts, we were tagged, which means that we received notifications based on these tags. Most the comments we received were positive and uplifting. Some, though, chose to comment on how painful and awful Elliot's particular surgery was. With a lot of free time to spend worrying in the hospital, I couldn't help but let these messages add to my worry. I wondered what the motivation was in sending these messages during the surgery. I wondered if, perhaps, these people didn't realize I'd be seeing the comments since the status update was not my own.Just a note to everyone reading this: Never tell the parents how painful surgery is, how your surgery was messed up, how you know someone who died in surgery, how you wouldn't wish that surgery upon anybody, how someone is suing their doctor after surgery, etc. while the child is in surgery. These comments will only be seen as negative and will make the parent want to punch you in your stupid face for thinking that was a helpful comment.Ultimately for me, Facebook's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness for a situation like this. While we were able to inform friends and family quickly about the surgery's status, I found myself wanting more phone calls and personal interaction. There's just no real replacement for it. I think I fell for the ease of a quick post and friends fell for reading a status update as being enough. Old school communication is not completely lost, though. Elliot got lots of toys, balloons, and flowers. Mom and dad got chocolates and liquor (to ease our pain, of course). And, we even got a personal visit from that online support we love. By the way, that friend eased our pain by telling us she doesn't not remember any of her surgeries from when she was little. Thank you, Ileana.I could have stayed off Facebook during the whole hospital stay, but then many of the people who love Elliot would have been worrying, waiting for a phone call that we didn't have the energy to give. Also, I would have missed out on all the messages of support. We also did some good in that six hours. My wife, dad, and I gave blood in the hospital blood clinic. Elliot needed some of that clinic blood later so it felt good knowing we added three pints to the collection that day. Also, I hope we helped spread the word about Children's Hospital Los Angeles. We love that place. "

In other words, Christoph is super royal.Adelaide, on the other hand, is not: she's the daughter of Philippe Drapé-Frisch, a French diplomat who moved his family across Europe throughout her childhood. The 22-year-old student met her fiance at Jeunesse Lumière, a Catholic school where the pair spent a gap year between high school and college. The young couple were married first in a civil ceremony at the Hôtel de Ville of Nancy, France on Friday followed by a religious service at the Basilique Saint-Epvre de Nancy on Saturday attended by over 1,000 guests.The bride wore a seasonally-appropriate white gown with a fur collar and cuffs designed by French couturier Diane Lelys while the groom's mother wore a royal repeat: a blue suit first worn in 2000 by her mother, Grand Duchess Joséphine, at her brother Henri's investiture ceremony. (One blog notes that Princess Marie Astrid wore a brown version of the suit at the wedding of another one of her children, Archduchess Marie Christine.)It's reported that no foreign royals besides those from Luxembourg and Austria were in attendance -- but thankfully, there were plenty of photographers around.
