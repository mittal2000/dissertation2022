But she made it all sound easy -- should she have?,2012-11-28,"FILE- In this Monday, April 19, 2010 file photo, Google vice president of search products and user experience, Marissa Mayer, attends the 2010 Matrix Awards presented by the New York Women in Communications at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. Yahoo announced Monday, July 16, 2012, that it is hiring longtime Google executive Marissa Mayer to be its next CEO, the fifth in five years as the company struggles to rebound from years of financial malaise and internal turmoil. Mayer, who starts at Yahoo Inc. on Tuesday, was one of Googleￂﾒs earliest employees and was most recently responsible for its mapping, local and location services. (AP Photo/Evan Agostini)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c904d1f00002d00214526.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yahoo!'s new female CEO Marissa Mayer spoke out for the first time about juggling the demands of tending to Yahoo! and a baby. But she made it all sound easy -- should she have?Marissa Mayer, I think it's terrific that you took on the incredibly demanding job of CEO of Yahoo!, especially when you were six months pregnant.Appearing To Be Super WomanAt 37, you are an inspiring role model for all young and not-so-young, working women.But when you gave your first interview since giving birth to your first child, son Macallister Bogue, on Sept. 30, you spoke out in a way that may have made the hearts of many working moms drop.It certainly wasn't intentional, but I think Marissa, in trying to be totally positive about your job, company and motherhood in general, you minimized the parenting demands you're under.""I knew that the job would be hard, and I knew that the baby would be fun,"" you told an audience at Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women dinner in Palo Alto, California on Nov. 27.""And the thing that surprised me, and really puzzlingly so, is that the job is really fun! Yahoo! is a really fun place to work,"" you explained.But then you said -- and this is the kicker:""The baby's been way easier than everyone made it out to be. I think I've been really lucky that way but I had a very easy, healthy pregnancy, he's been easy. So those have been the two really terrific surprises -- the kid has been easier and the job has been fun!""Is It Really That Easy?Marissa -- I think you're an amazing trooper, but I'm sorry, I don't believe you for one second when you say that ""the baby's been way easier than everyone made it out to be.""It's just that first-time motherhood for any woman is never ""easy,"" no matter how much help you have. Babies are demanding. They need to be fed, often so many times a day that you barely finish one feeding when they're ready for another. Then there's the sleeping issue at night. And even if you have a night nurse who cares for the baby all night, if you're breastfeeding you still need to get up to feed. Sometimes babies are fussy and cry a lot. Sometimes they have colic. And no mom can help herself from wanting to comfort their baby.Then there's your body changes. It's uncomfortable to even sit down for a while after giving birth; your milk comes in; your emotions go on a roller coaster as your hormones change.All of this is manageable -- but it's not ""easy,"" and especially when you're also responsible for running a $20 billion business. Plus, it's one that you only took over a few months ago.You, yourself decided to only take two weeks of maternity leave after you gave birth because you clearly felt the weight of your responsibilities sitting on your shoulders.That in itself must have been a tough decision. I'm a mom of four, who also returned to work quickly after giving birth to each of my babies, but physically, it's a tough gig and emotionally, it's just as hard I completely sympathize.Nevertheless with 12,000 employees at Yahoo! and a board of directors looking for you to lead, plus your own enthusiasm to get in and get the job done, you felt it was important to make the sacrifice of returning to work quickly.All of this is understandable and hugely commendable, but I think it's ok to let a little of your super woman image slip. Working women, and working moms especially, would appreciate you letting us know that you are ""just like us,"" too.The Reality Of Being A Working MomWhen you just say that it's been easier than you expected, most working moms simply respond ""of course it is for her -- she's worth a fortune, she can afford 24 hours, 7 days a week babysitters, a cook, a housekeeper, a chauffeur, personal shoppers, assistants at the office, etc."" -- you get my drift.That's what most women are immediately thinking because they've been there, up with a sick, crying baby in the middle of the night, with bosses needing reports done, and trying to figure out who's going to care for their little one the next day, because they can't take them to daycare.Most working moms may love their careers and babies, but mostly they just feel EXHAUSTED and overwhelmed.Click to read more at HollywoodLife.com!"
1,WELLNESS,10 Holiday Shopping Guidelines for the Soul,"Dr. Judith Rich, Contributor
Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/holiday-stress_us_5b9c8d79e4b03a1dcc7fbc2d,"With a personal history of compulsive holiday shopping, I now eschew this activity altogether. Here's what I've learned from five years of recovery.",2012-11-28,"NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 24: A Black Friday bargain hunter carries a Toys R' Us bag in front of the store, which opened it's doors at 9PM Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 2011 in New York City. Marking the start of the holiday shopping season, Black Friday is one of retailers' busiest days of the year. (Photo by Michael Nagle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8d79240000310094b8e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's that time of year again when for many people, after a year of pinching pennies, all that carefully cultivated restraint goes out the window and something primal is triggered: the holiday shopping gene! First, two confessions: Confession #1: I am completing my fifth year as a recovering holiday shopper. You can read my earlier posts on this subject here and here. This post is my 2012 shopping sobriety update. Confession #2: I have never been a good shopper, holiday or otherwise. I could never hold my own with those friends who qualify as ""ninja shoppers,"" who have perfected the art of getting not only a ""deal,"" but also getting the best deal out there. I am clueless when it comes to getting a deal. I am a primitive shopper, more like a modern day cavewoman: Hunt prey, find prey, kill prey, which I hope you understand, means buy prey. It's not that I have unlimited resources wherein I never have to consider price or the value of things. I am not opposed to getting a deal, but it has to fall in my lap, and even then, I usually don't recognize one when it hits me in the face. I simply don't have the necessary instincts to recognize a deal, much less go out and hunt for one. I do understand that for many in this economy, getting a deal is the only way they can afford to purchase certain desired objects. I might fall into this category if I were playing the game. However, after many ill-fated attempts to qualify as a shopping warrior, I long ago admitted failure and now prefer to warm the bench. For many others, shopping has become a kind of competitive sport, with the teams consisting of Shopper vs. Retailer. The game goes like this: Team Retailer offers a ""loss leader,"" a hard-to-refuse deal, cleverly designed to entice Team Shopper into the store. Funnel enough shoppers into the store on a specific date, with limited hours, competing for a ""limited"" availability of good deals and you have what we now call Black Friday, the ultimate arena of competitive shopping, wherein shoppers now literally risk life and limb for a good deal. But is this activity soul-filling or soul-killing? Is it really a deal to spend $800 for a 51-inch flat-screened TV if you don't have the $800 to begin with? Is it a good deal to hurry through the Thanksgiving dinner, where you just expressed thanks for what you already have, so you can be first in line at Walmart to buy more ""stuff""? Is it a good deal to support a retailer that doesn't believe in paying its employees a living wage and forces them to leave their families to work on holidays so you can get a deal? What is the Black Friday death toll so far this year? Whatever it is, to me, it's much too high a price to pay for a deal. I can't help but wonder: America, what are we doing? When will we learn? What will be the Black Friday equivalent of Hurricane Sandy that will finally wake up consumers to the terrible price they're paying for a deal? Without consciously being aware of it, consumers have bought the ""party line"" that consumption is their patriotic duty. ""Go shopping"" was president Bush's antidote to the terrorist attacks of 2001. Remember that? We were not asked to save or conserve or serve our fellow man. We were asked to consume more ""stuff."" Boy, did we take that advice to heart! And so Black Friday sales rose to more than $1 billion this year, and that doesn't include Cyber Monday results. Is this a figure we should be proud of? Each of us must live according to our own values and conscience and choose what works for us. But I do want to raise the questions, so that those who engage in this national sporting activity can do so consciously and not at the effect of media manipulation. With a personal history of compulsive holiday shopping, I now eschew this activity altogether and instead of hunting and capturing the perfect gift, my Black Fridays are spent sitting on the holiday shopping sidelines, keeping the bench warm and tending to the matters of my soul. A much more satisfying activity, I might add. Here's what I've learned from five years of recovery offered in the form of 10 holiday shopping guidelines for the soul: 1) Keep it simple. Keep it small.  The soul is not fancy. It is not grandiose. It's not impressed with designer labels nor does it care how much you spend. That's the ego's territory. To the soul less is more. A plate of homemade cookies, a shared cup of tea, time spent with a loved one counts most to the soul.2) Slow it down. Speed is the ego's game. Ego wants more, faster, bigger, better. When you catch yourself in the grip of this game and find yourself pushing against the flow, this is the time to push the pause button and stop everything. Go on strike. Give yourself a time out. Then...3)  Turn inward. Make the space to become still and listen to your soul's inner guidance. Ask what your soul is needing in this moment. Then...4)  Follow instructions.  Your soul knows exactly what is the best way forward from here. Pay attention. Trust your soul's instincts. It will always lead you down the right path. 5) Lighten up. Holiday shopping can become serious business. Always there is pressure to get it done and on time, as if your life depended on it. Get a grip! Take a deep breath, remember what matters, and have some fun while you're at it. There is nothing like a healthy dose of laughter, even if it's at your own expense, to restore perspective. Your soul appreciates a sense of humor, so lighten up just a bit. 6) Step away from the mall.  Mall energy is soul-killing. If you must buy gifts, stay away from the big stores whenever possible. Support your local small business owners. Enjoy the slower and quieter pace of those local shops that provide unique items. And remember #1 -- keep it simple.7)  Gift a donation to a favorite charity in your friends' names. Support those causes that make a difference and honor your friends at the same time. It's a triple win: The charity wins, your soul wins, and your friends win. What could be better than that? And you don't have to brave traffic or fight for a parking place to boot. 8)  Consider experiential gifts only. This is what we do in my family. No wrapped presents, experiential gifts only. Our gifts to each other involve spending time together in ways we don't normally do the rest of the year. Attend a special Christmas concert or play, take a tour of holiday lights, take a family field trip to the mountains or seashore or a local place in nature that feeds your collective souls. Go skiing, have a picnic. What does your geographical area provide at this time of year? Get out and enjoy the season together.9) Stay present. It's far too easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of the season and lose sight of what it's all about. What is it all about for you? What does this time of year beckon you to be and do? Stay mindful of the true meaning of this season and get yourself back on track if you wander off. 10) No one is judging you. Holiday shopping is not a performance evaluation. You will not be fired or promoted based on your adeptness at shopping. Sometimes the ego gets mixed up and goes racing into all its old programs: ""Am I good enough? Am I worthy?"" Your worth is not measured by your performance at the holidays. You're already worthy. Now, go and enjoy yourself. What does your soul yearn for at this time of year? What makes your holiday experience soul satisfying? What traditions do you look forward to? What are you ready to leave behind? I'd love to hear from you.

3,WEDDINGS,"Ben Silbermann, Pinterest Founder And CEO, Talks Criticism, Fears",Sara Wilson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-silbermann-pinterest_us_5b9c8c2be4b03a1dcc7fa8f0,You have 80 people on your team now? What’s been the most unfair criticism of the site? What was the moment you knew the,2012-11-27,"Printerest co-founder Ben Silbermann talks to technology reporters about his company's application during Facebook's special invitation only event at Twenty Five Lusk restaurant and lounge in San Francisco on January 18, 2012 in California. AFP Photo / Kimihiro Hoshino (Photo credit should read KIMIHIRO HOSHINO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8c2b2500003600361bd7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Chances are, you're pretty familiar with Pinterest, the tremendously addictive site that allows users to ""pin"" any image from the Web -- from drool-worthy casseroles to out-of-this-world travel destinations -- onto virtual boards. Maybe you even used it to plan your wedding.Indeed, weddings pinboards are among the most popular on the site; a spokesperson from Pinterest confirmed in a recent USA Today article that there are tens of thousands of wedding-related boards on the site, and wannabe brides are planning their future nuptials on Pinterest before they're even engaged.Of course, the site's phenomenal success extends far beyond weddings -- with nearly 27 million unique visitors in October, the site is the third-largest source of referral traffic on the Web and, according to a recent Los Angeles Times story, has been valued at $1.5 billion.What you may not have heard as much about is the site's Iowa-born founder and CEO, Ben Silbermann. That's because he rarely speaks to the the press. So we were delighted when he decided to sit down with us for an interview following a talk he gave at Camp Mighty, a recent weekend-long conference in Palm Springs, Calif., devoted to helping the mostly female blogger-and-online-entrepreneur-participants accomplish their life goals.Over breakfast at the Ace Hotel & Swim Club's King's Highway restaurant, Silbermann opened up about the biggest myths about success in Silicon Valley, the most unfair criticism of the site and some of his scariest moments with Pinterest.  Huffington Post: There was a long period from when you launched the site to when you actually started to see a critical mass of visitors, right?Ben Silbermann: Yeah, we launched in March [2010]. By June we had a few thousand users. These days, expectations are very high. Instagram hit 1 million users in three weeks. Some games hit 2 million users in two months. So the growth felt really slow by comparison.How did you hang in there during those first slow months?I always read about these stories of entrepreneurs -- it’s like they’re in the desert with no water, and they’re the ones that survive. But I’ve been really fortunate to have people on my team who are optimistic about the future and who know that if you work through hard times that there’s usually something good at the end. What was the moment you knew the site was catching on with users?  There were two moments. One was when I realized that people really seemed to enjoy the site and the content. They really used it. I’ve worked on products that a lot of people used, but it was very light usage. This was different. The second was, we had a meet-up at a store in San Francisco called Rare Device. A lot of real users came, and it was clear they had a genuine connection with each other, even if they didn’t know one another. The process of sharing the things they were proud of connected them -- when people make a pinboard, it’s how they literally see the world -- so that was very cool. I use Pinterest for everything. Book collections, trips, hobbies. It’s all there. I planned my wedding on it. When I had a kid, I planned all his stuff on it. So it was nice to discover that I wasn’t the only one.Wait, you planned your wedding on Pinterest?Yeah! I found my wedding photographer on it!The majority of Pinterest users are women. Did you purposely pursue female audiences when you launched?  We didn’t build [Pinterest] specifically with women in mind. I personally believe that finding other people in the world that appreciate your tastes and interests is not a gender-specific thing. I think that our goal is to build a service that everyone in the world can use. We want to try to give you that moment where you find the collection or person and you think, ""Oh my gosh -- I don’t know that person, but they totally get me."" It’s like when you walk into a shop and half of you is like, ""How is this happening? I thought I was so unique,"" and the other half is like, ""Yes!"" Once the site started to take off, what aspect was most nerve-wracking?  I used to wake up and look at our analytics and think, ""What if yesterday was the last day anyone used Pinterest?"" Like, everyone collectively decided, ""We’re done!"" Over time I got more confidence. But I still feel tons of urgency to make it better, to hurry up and fix all the problems.Is that urgency just in your nature, or is it something about Pinterest itself?  Both. Definitely it’s who I am. I always just want to move along to the next step. And it’s also a function of the industry. When I worked at Google, we were [housed] in the [former] SGI [Silicon Graphics] buildings. The Facebook offices are in the [former] Sun Microsystems buildings. In tech, history is so recent. We’ve seen companies -- even since we’ve started -- get huge and then fall off, so there’s this urgency to try to build something really valuable in a short time.How does that manifest in the way you manage your team?  I’d never managed anyone before, so I don’t have a lot of experience. But I’m lucky -- I have a lot of team members who have a really honest relationship with me. And there are definitely times when they’re like, ""You need to calm down.""Like when? You seem like a very calm person.  It’s not like I’m jumping around the table throwing things, but one thing that’s been hard to learn is that different people are motivated and inspired by different things. I’m not the kind of person by nature who celebrates everything. I just am like, ""OK, great, let’s move on, let’s get better."" [But I’ve realized] it’s important to celebrate -- to let the whole team enjoy the moment without becoming complacent about it -- especially as you build teams. And that’s something you’ve had to learn?  Learning. We’re having a holiday party and people are like, ""What do you think the holiday theme should be?"" And I’ll be like, ""I’m not a party planner.""So many copycats have sprung up in the wake of Pinterest’s success. Do you consider those competition? I think when it comes to places people go to find inspiration, there’s a lot [of competition] both online and offline. And I’m neurotic -- I can name every competitor. We obviously pay attention to what’s going on in the market, especially if there’s a design that looks really, really similar -- and we’ve seen that. But I don’t know if [those sites are] really competition per se. They’re just different. The asset we’re always competing for is time. That part of your day when you’re willing to relax and invest in yourself. We’re trying to make that time really rich. Come January, our users shouldn’t look back and be like, ""Oh my god, what a terrible waste of my time."" What’s been the most unfair criticism of the site?People say, ""Oh, Pinterest is only about decadent desserts or cupcakes that look like hydrangeas."" But I think there are actually a lot of people who use the service in a lot of different ways. Obviously there are trends, but I don’t think the service is about the trends; the trends are a byproduct of people looking at things that they really love. And there’s a big difference. I think as we get better and the site continues to diversify, we’ll try to more and more quickly get you to things that you care about versus what everyone else cares about.You're famously private. You said at one point that you had a press email account you didn’t check or respond to for months. Why was that?Early on we were just really focused on the site. There were three of us. We thought, ""Should we make the product a lot better or deal with press?"" Yes, we should have been more responsive. But the press took it as ""OMG, these guys hate press. Who do they think they are?"" And you know how press is. Even if you don’t give them anything, they still have to write something. And then usually when we talked to them and they visited the office, they’d be like, ""Oh, I get it. It makes sense. They’re busy."" Also, I’m sort of introverted. And when you take a sort of introverted person and ask him a lot of questions on the phone, sometimes good things happen and sometimes bad things happen. That’s been the best thing about being able to hire people -- you can hire people who know all this stuff you don’t know. You won't discuss your business model or even if you make money. So what can you say about the future of the business?When Pinterest works well, it helps you find things that are meaningful to you. We want to build a system that helps you do that. Some of those things are commercial and some of them aren’t. In the best products, the monetization of the product doesn’t feel like a tax on what you’re there to do. I think there’s an opportunity to do that, but it will take a little time to build. We’re obviously not just gonna splash banner ads all over. You have 80 people on your team now?Yeah, and growing. It’s kinda crazy.In your Camp Mighty talk, you said your philosophy is about constantly positioning yourself at the intersection of terror and joy. What has been the most recent manifestation of that?We just moved our office to San Francisco from Palo Alto. I’ve always been very thrifty. When you sign a lease for an office, it’s a multiyear lease. We have an office space we rented that is a former women's shoe store we’re going to convert that can accommodate 250 to 300 people. When I walk by, I think, ""That’s so cool."" And then I also think, ""Holy crap. Look at that big-ass building."" It’s exciting, but it’s also like, ""I’d better not fuck this up.""Below, check out images from this year's Camp Mighty in Palm Springs, Calif.Keep in touch!

Today I live with the clear knowing that all is well. The disillusionment has been replaced with a trust in myself and life in general.Sometimes my view on life brings up a lot of anger in some people, I have been called many things on that account: dumb, unloving, naive, cruel, anal, ruthless...I get it -- that some people are only able to feel right by making others wrong. I have always thought that it's an unpractical and not very loving way to live your life, but we all do the things that work best for us.I feel that there's deep love and great safety when we take 100 percent responsibility. I don't expect everyone else to do the same. And I would never give people advice if they hadn't asked for it. I concentrate on thriving and lifting those who contact me for help.A positive view on life is all about nurturing the essences we want active. It's okay for life to hurt, and it's very well when things feel like crap, as long as we take responsibility and course correct when things are not the way we would like them to be.The suffering can become enormous if we look at ourselves and others as victims. And from there not much can be changed, so that idea is not something I'll ever endorse. The point must be that each one of us adapts the view on life that will lead to most nurturing.For more by Christine Eilvig, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."
