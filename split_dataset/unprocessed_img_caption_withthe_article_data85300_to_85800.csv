Photo by Karolina Turek.There's something about Norwegian actor Nils Hognestad that melts me. Ever meet someone and you know they have something special, but you can't pinpoint it? Exactly. So now you know what -- I mean who -- is keeping me up at night!Tell us about your family history and your first name, Nils.Well, I'm a purebred Norwegian -- born in Bergen, with both parents from families of 10 and entire family history stemming from Norway. I was named after my Morfar (mom's dad), who died of similar heart complications that I was born with, actually. The name Nils means 'Champion of the People', but it also means the plural of nothing, which I like to think more of as infinite than nothing. Hah!In the YTV teen comedy hit Some Assembly Required, what's it like performing in front of a live audience for TV vs. a live audience for theatre?You know, Some Assembly Required was such a refreshing experience for me. I had done a lot of theatre before, and a lot of film and television, but shooting in front of a live studio audience is a perfect hybrid of the two. While doing anything on camera, you don't get any of the feedback from your performance until it premieres months later; whereas in theatre, you know immediately how your performance is being received. With a live studio audience, you not only get the immediate feedback on your performance, but you also get these wonderful broken 4th wall moments of interaction with the audience while they're setting up for the next take- which you would never get in theatre. It's a rare joy when you get to interact with your audience during the immediacy of filming.You were born in Norway but spent most of your childhood in London and Vancouver. Why did you move around? What are the differences you noticed as a child between Norway, London and Vancouver? Do you still have family in Norway?I moved around so much because of my father's work. He works in shipping and we found ourselves moving to the ports with the best opportunities for his career advancement. My sister and I made the moves entertaining for ourselves -- pretending we were Norwegian royalty that were under witness protection, and that at the age of 18, we would return to our parents, the king and queen of Norway. In Bergen, Norway, you could sense how small it all was, whereas London was the opposite. If you blinked for too long, you'd be lost worse than a kid in Walmart. Now Vancouver, I found, has this wild, independent nature. I believe any city, like life, is what you make of it, and it will be whatever you need it to be. As much as I hated moving around growing up, in hindsight it was the most beneficial thing for my development. But I have also learned that Vancouver is home. This is where my heart is. The majority of my family -- including 43 first cousins -- still live in Norway. I visit as often as possible, which is never enough.What's it like working with kids on set, such as in MY SISTER'S KIDS: MY GOLD RUSH ADVENTURE?In the past two years I've found myself on set with a lot of kids, and I constantly have this echo of Jim Carrey in my ear. He was quoted in an article once, saying that working with children and animals had taught him more about acting and life than working with adults. I couldn't agree more. The natural openness of animals and children is something I think every adult needs to strive towards in acting, and working with children is a constant reminder to simply be present and not focus on how you're performing or how you look.What's with the beard, dude?Hahaha! Well, it started with a whole lot of laziness, then I loved the look, continued booking work, and decided to continue maintaining it. 2014 was the year of the wild beard, 2015 is the year of the short, managed beard.How many tattoos do you have and where are they placed? What is the reason for each tattoo?I have one large tattoo that takes up a quarter of my back and I'm constantly getting it extended. It started with a signature -- which is a combination of my grandfather's signature, and my own. I have flowers that represent everywhere I've lived and every member in my family. There's a stag, a tree of life, a crab, a butterfly, a waterfall, icicles, and I'm about to get a crow, moon, and our solar system added to the mix. Everything is representative of a very specific time, person, or accomplishment in my life.The CD Exchange club you're in, where you switch music CD's with others sounds cool! How did you get involved with the club?Yah! It's wicked!! I'm apart of a couple CD clubs, and it's just an eclectic mix of people that share our tastes with each other. At this exact moment, I'm listening to Barry Latimore, 'Move and Groove Together'. I have quite the vast taste in music. I don't like extremes of any type of music - except pop. Super bubblegum pop is the only extreme I can handle. I may be Norwegian, but death or black metal is not my jam. Though, I have found myself at metal concerts in the past. I like punk, classical, jazz, funk, soul, pop, musicals, folk, country, and I'm sure there's more. Play me any motown or soul, and I'm melting. I have been doing these CD clubs since 2006, and I don't quite recall how it all began. It was purely a way to keep in touch with friends around the world while I was living in London, and has just become something that has grown to so many people - there are handfuls of people I don't know personally, just musically. Caption this pic of Nils Hognestad in the comments section below!You've done a lot of theater. What's your best and worst theater experience ever, as a young performer and as an adult.This is a tough question. My best as an adult was playing Macbeth in London. Hands down. Even though I've already played it, it is still a dream role of mine. Call me Norwegian, but I have a very strong affinity to all things dark, morbid, and haunting.My worst as a young performer? Probably that time I did a show in middle of nowhere Ontario, wearing nothing but a pair of underwear that had bunny ears and a tail. I have never been so aggressively attacked by a crowd of blue haired biddies.What clothing and shoe brands do you like to wear and why?I go through phases, but right now I'm obsessed with Moods of Norway clothing, and John Fluevog shoes. I love Fluevogs because they're local and always unique statement pieces. And Moods of Norway I love because A) They're Norwegian, B) They have a sense of humor to their clothing (all their tags say that the clothes were made by really, really pretty blonde girls), and C) Their logo is a tractor. I feel like I'm staying true to my father's farming roots by wearing their clothes.What's the most important thing in your daily routine?Being self-employed, my daily routine changes constantly. Some mornings I wake up and go to the gym after a smoothie, others I wake up and meditate, or on really tough mornings, it's directly to the shower to lie down until I wake up proper. But the constant for me is food. I have to eat within the first 30 minutes of waking up, or else I get hungry. It is all dependent on what I need to get done that day - but I have to do one to two physical activities a day; whether that be yoga and swimming or hiking and gym or water polo and paddle boarding. I try to floss daily, but the most important thing for me is my daily shower. I don't feel properly balanced and refreshed until I've had my shower.Anything else you'd like to say?Yah!

2,ENTERTAINMENT,Live from the Nantucket Film Festival,"Marshall Fine, ContributorAuthor and film critic, hollywoodandfine.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/live-from-the-nantucket-f_b_7677206.html,"This is my second year at the Nantucket Film Festival, and this will probably be my one dispatch, mostly because I'm having too much fun to take time to write about it.",2015-06-27,2015-06-27-1435401297-2716554-TheEndoftheTourMovie1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-27-1435401297-2716554-TheEndoftheTourMovie1-thumb.jpg,"This is my second year at the Nantucket Film Festival, and this will probably be my one dispatch, mostly because I'm having too much fun to take time to write about it.Most of that has to do with the films I'm seeing. While I cover Toronto and Sundance because they offer news of what the stream of movies for the upcoming months will look like, Nantucket is more laidback, less commercially pushy. This isn't a market -- and it's not a festival that attracts swarms of press trying to see the next big thing before anyone else does.Instead, this island, an hour's ferry ride from Hyannis, Mass., is about offering the best of what's to come in the months ahead: films that may already have played Sundance or Berlin or even Cannes, most of which are headed for arthouses and multiplexes before the summer is through. It gives me the chance to catch up with films I missed at earlier festivals because of timing or other choices I had to make at those earlier gatherings: That looks interesting, but I really have to see this other one first. Which is how, in my first 36 hours on the island, I caught up with four documentaries that I had missed elsewhere, as well as one drama. The satisfaction from all of them was significant.The other thing I like about this festival is that it exposes me to an audience that most festivals don't. At Sundance or Toronto, I mostly see press screenings. In Nantucket, there are no press screenings, so instead of sitting with a colleague discussing the prospects for the films we've seen (critically, financially), I'm watching movies with ""civilians,"" if you will, who aren't trying to do the calculus about the film's success but, rather, just want to see a good movie.There are quite a few of them here in Nantucket. At the largest venue, the island's high school auditorium, I saw the opening night film, James Ponsoldt's The End of the Tour, based on an encounter between a Rolling Stone reporter (played by Jesse Eisenberg) and writer David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel). I'll have more to say about it when it is released at the end of July, but I found it to be a movingly rendered story about an artist who finds himself trapped between the urge to create something meaningful and the expectations and demands that come with achieving that goal on a scale that brings overwhelming attention from the press and readers.I also got a chance to see (for a second time) Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, before I did a post-screening Q&A with the writer of both the film and the novel on which it was based, Jesse Andrews. This touching little film deals with coming of age for a high school senior (played with winningly vulnerable diffidence by Thomas Mann), who becomes best friends with a classmate (Olivia Cook) who has leukemia. Andrews was a lively talker, who told the story of his journey from struggling novelist to in-demand screenwriter with entertainly self-deprecating energy.Otherwise, I've devoted my time to documentaries, all of which told stories of the struggle to hold on to essential values and forge new paths, in the face of hurdles and obstacles of various sorts. This commentary continues on my website."
3,ENTERTAINMENT,Amy Schumer Could Have Hosted 'The Daily Show',E. Oliver Whitney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-schumer-daily-show_n_7678148.html,,2015-06-27,"Amy Schumer, the writer and star of the upcoming film ""Trainwreck,"" waves to the audience during the Universal Pictures presentation at CinemaCon 2015 at Caesars Palace on Thursday, April 23, 2015, in Las Vegas. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a91e52400007b00042fdc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Jon Stewart announced he was stepping down from ""The Daily Show"" earlier this year, a handful of names popped up as potential replacements. ""Daily Show"" correspondent Trevor Noah ended up being the lucky one chosen to fill Stewart's seat, but The New York Times and The Daily Beast have uncovered a few other names that were considered for the Comedy Central show.A Times profile of the comedy network last week revealed that Amy Poehler and Chris Rock were two of the people considered for the hosting gig. Apparently, though, the ""Parks and Recreation"" star gave the network ""the quickest 'no' in history,"" while Rock only wanted to host through the 2016 presidential election. Kent Alterman, the president of content and original programming at Comedy Central, told the Times they eventually decided on Noah and that the young South African comedian was the ""the only person [they] made an offer to."" As it turns out, that's not completely true.The Daily Beast did a little digging and asked Amy Schumer, another Comedy Central star, if she was ever offered the job. ""Yes,"" Schumer told The Daily Beast. ""I was so honored to be asked and considered."" But the ""Inside Amy Schumer"" star didn't feel right committing to five years at the show. ""I thought, ‘Well, I could give everyone I love a job and we could all be together for five years,'"" Schumer said. ""But picturing being in a building and knowing what I was going to do for five years -- I love not knowing. And I’ve never done anything safe or to make money for that reason. So, you know, I said, 'I can’t start now.'"" Yes, that's the sound of tears hitting the floor as we realize a Schumer-hosted ""Daily Show"" could have been a thing. Imagine a ""Daily Show"" with brilliant sketches about rape culture, cameos by Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Patricia Arquette and maybe even full-episode parodies of classic movies. But alas, it will never happen.For more, head to The Daily Beast."
4,POLITICS,Which Woman Should Adorn the $10 Bill?,"Peter Dreier, ContributorE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental Col...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/which-woman-should-adorn-_1_b_7676710.html,"Although none of these 20 women were elected to office, they all had a great influence on public opinion and public policy.

This March, Barbara Ortiz Howard and Susan Ades Stone started a campaign called Women on 20s to demand that the government replace former President Andrew Jackson's image on the $20 bill with a woman from history.Now, the Obama administration is following through, although not in the way that the two women and the many followers they galvanized had hoped. Last week, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced that in 2020 -- the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote -- a woman will appear on the $10 note, not the $20 bill. Lew explained that the $10 bill was already scheduled to be redesigned to deal with counterfeiting threats. The new currency will feature state-of-the-art security and composition features and will include a tactile element for the visually impaired. Lew hinted that Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first Treasury Secretary, will not disappear from the $10 note. Whatever woman is selected will be on some of the bills, while Hamilton will remain on others.""We've been asking for historic change, and this is the first step,"" Stone said. Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire introduced a bill in April to put a woman on the $20, shared Stone's mixed emotions: ""While it might not be the $20 bill, make no mistake, this is a historic announcement and a big step forward.""The new $10 note won't be the first time a woman has been featured on paper currency. In the 19th century, Martha Washington was featured on a dollar bill. And from 1865 to 1869, Pocahontas was part of a group photo featured on the $20 note.Lew, who has the final say in the matter, said that he will select ""a woman who has played a major role in our history who represents the theme of democracy."" The Treasury Department has created a website -- www.thenew10.treasury.gov -- for Americans to submit suggestions. Comments can also be submitted on Twitter using the hashtag #TheNew10. The public can propose both which woman should be chosen and which symbols of democracy should be included in the redesigned bill. ""We are asking the American people to tell us what democracy means to them,"" Lew said. ""Their feedback will shape what the new bill will look like.""To help in that effort, here are the names and brief biographies of 20 women who fought to make the United States a more humane country. They played key roles in the major movements for social justice throughout the nation's history. When they first advanced their ideas -- from abolishing slavery, to granting women the right to vote, to ending child labor, to giving workers the right to unionize, to protecting consumers from harmful products, to creating old age insurance and the minimum wage -- they were considered impractical idealists, utopian dreamers, or dangerous radicals. But now we take these ideas for granted. Although none of these 20 women were elected to office, they all had a great influence on public opinion and public policy. The reformers profiled below exercised influence not only because of the number of people they mobilized, but also because of the moral force of their ideas. They influenced Americans' attitudes about right and wrong, the treatment of different groups, and the responsibility of society to meet human needs. The law dictates that U.S. currency cannot feature a living person, so a number of women who belong in this pantheon of great reformers -- such as labor activist Dolores Huerta, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, feminist leader Gloria Steinem, and tennis star and women's rights crusader Billie Jean King -- do not yet quality.The women are listed chronologically by their date of birth. An expanded version of this article, with longer profiles of these 20 courageous women, can be found here. 1. Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906). Anthony was a leading abolitionist and suffragist. She was inspired to fight for women's rights while campaigning against alcohol. Denied a chance to speak at a temperance convention because she was a woman, she realized that no one would take women in politics seriously unless they had the right to vote. In 1872, she voted illegally in the presidential election. She was arrested for the crime, unsuccessfully fought the charges, was fined $100, but refused to pay it. She died before women got the vote through the 19th Amendment in 1920.2. Harriet Tubman (1822-1913). Born into slavery, Tubman was best known as an abolitionist and leader of the Underground Railroad, but she was also an outspoken advocate for granting women the right to vote. She is most well-known for being a conductor on the Underground Railroad. During a 10-year span she made 19 trips into the South and escorted over 300 slaves to freedom. She helped create an elaborate secret network of safe houses - -the Underground Railroad -- organized for that purpose. As she once proudly pointed out to fellow abolitionist Frederick Douglass, in all of her journeys she ""never lost a single passenger."" 3. Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902). Stanton was an abolitionist and leading figure of the early woman's rights movement. In July 1848, she helped organize the first major women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York. She drafted the ""Declaration of Sentiments"" and took the lead in proposing that women be granted the right to vote. Along with Susan B. Anthony, whom she met in the early 1850s, Stanton formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) in 1869. Stanton was the NWSA's first president--a position she held until 1890.4. Florence Kelley (1859-1932). Kelley did more than any other 20th century American to rectify the awful conditions of child labor. She was also a leading organizer against sweatshops and a pioneering advocate for working women. She helped lead the battle for groundbreaking local, state, and federal labor laws, including ones that established the minimum wage and the eight-hour day. Kelley, the longtime leader of the National Consumers League, was a path-breaker in conducting social and statistical research to expose workplace abuses and in developing strategies -- such as factory inspections and consumer organizing - - to pressure state legislatures and Congress to improve working conditions. 5. Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935). Gilman was a path breaking feminist, humanist, and socialist whose lectures, novels, short stories (including her most famous, ""The Yellow Wallpaper""), magazine articles, and nonfiction books challenged the dominant ideas about women's role in society and helped shape the movement for women's suffrage and women's rights. By the late 1800s, Gilman was the most important feminist thinker in the United States. She combined economic and sociological writings with fiction and utopian thinking, giving her a broad appeal.6. Jane Addams (1860-1935). The founder of the settlement house movement and of the American social work profession, Addams was an important Progressive Era urban reformer, a founder of the NAACP, a champion of women's suffrage, an anti-war crusader, and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. Addams carved out a new way for women to become influential in public affairs. In 1889 she and her college friend, Ellen Gates Starr (1859-1940), founded Hull House in one Chicago's immigrant slum neighborhoods, inspired by similar efforts she had seen in England. Hull House became the inspiration for hundreds of other settlement houses in cities across the country and helped establish the fields of both social work and community organizing.7. Ida B. Wells (1862-1931). Wells was an African-American journalist and activist who led the anti-lynching crusade in the United States in the 1890s. In May 1884, Wells purchased a first-class train ticket from Memphis to Nashville. The train's conductor ordered her to move to the car for African Americans. She refused and was forcibly removed from the train. She sued the railroad and won a $500 settlement in a circuit court, but that decision was overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1887. Outraged by her treatment and by the court ruling, Wells began to write about issues of racial injustice for the Negro Press Association. She soon became editor of a weekly paper, Evening Star, and then of Living Way, at first writing under a pseudonym, ""Iola."" Black newspapers around the country reprinted her articles. Wells' writing was part of a wave of investigative ""muckraking"" reporting that exposed social injustices. She used her paper to investigate and denounce lynching, and to encourage blacks to retaliate by boycotting white-owned businesses and the segregated public transportation system.8. Alice Hamilton (1869-1970). Hamilton was a physician whose patient was America's working class. She was a brilliant scientist and an untiring reformer who founded the field of occupational medicine, which has helped save tens of millions of workers from unnecessary workplace injuries, diseases, and deaths. Hamilton was a pioneer in the field of toxicology, studying occupational illnesses and the dangerous effects of industrial metals and chemical compounds on the human body. She is a giant in the annals of public health not only because of her important research but also because she helped educate and mobilize the public and promoted legislation to protect workers and their communities. In 1900 only 5 percent of American physicians were women. By 1960 that number was still only 6 percent. Today it is about half.9. Margaret Sanger (1879-1966). Sanger is best known as an advocate for birth control and as the founder of the organization that is now called Planned Parenthood. Throughout her life, she ran afoul of the law in her quest to promote women's health. While working as a nurse, a turning point for Sanger came when one of her patients died from a self-induced abortion. Sanger decided her life's mission would be fighting for the right of low-income women to control their destinies and improve their health through family planning. In 1921 she founded the American Birth Control League, which eventually became Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood played a key role in the Supreme Court's 1965 ruling, Griswold v. Connecticut, which established a woman's right to control over her personal life and made birth control legal for married couples. This paved the way for Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that recognized a woman's right to choose to have an abortion.10. Helen Keller (1880-1968). The bronze statue of Keller that sits in the U.S. Capitol shows the blind girl standing at a water pump. It depicts the moment in 1887 when her teacher, Anne Sullivan, spelled ""W-A-T-E-R"" into one of her 7-year-old pupil's hands while water streamed into the other. This was Keller's awakening, when she made the connection between the word Sullivan spelled and the tangible substance splashing from the pump, whispering ""wah-wah,""--her way of saying ""water."" This scene, made famous in the play and film The Miracle Worker, has long defined Keller in the public mind as a symbol of courage in the face of overwhelming odds. Less well known (but no less inspiring) is the fact that Keller was a lifelong activist who participated in the great movements for social justice of her time. In her investigations into the causes of blindness, she discovered that poor people were more likely than the rich to be blind, and soon connected the mistreatment of the blind to the oppression of workers, women, and other groups, leading her to embrace feminism, pacifism and socialism.11. Frances Perkins (1880-1965). The first woman to work in a cabinet-level position, Perkins served as Secretary of Labor from 1933 to 1945. During that time she helped secure a remarkable array of benefits for American workers, including jobs programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Public Works Administration and its successor the Federal Works Agency, and the National Industrial Recovery Act. Among President Franklin Roosevelt's inner circle of advisors, she was the strongest proponent of the landmark National Labor Relations Act, passed in 1935, which gave workers the right to unionize. She led the fight for the 1935 Social Security Act, which established unemployment benefits, pensions for elderly Americans and financial aid for the poorest Americans. She was also the prime mover within the Cabinet for the Fair Labor Standards Act, passed in 1938, which created a federal minimum wage, established a 40-hour work week, guaranteed time-and-a-half for overtime in certain jobs and prohibited most employment of minors in ""oppressive child labor.""12. Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962). Throughout her life Roosevelt fought on behalf of America's most vulnerable citizens. She became friends with a widening circle of union activists, feminists, civil rights crusaders, and radicals whose ideas she embraced and advocated for both as FDR's wife and adviser and as a political figure in her own right. As First Lady, she devoted considerable time to those hardest hit by poverty, visiting an encampment of World War I veterans (called Bonus Marchers) in Washington, sharecroppers in the South, and people on breadlines in San Francisco and in the slums of Puerto Rico. She was much bolder than FDR in opposing racism, segregation, and lynching, becoming a close friend of Walter White (head of the NAACP), and made a point of publicly joining the controversial civil rights organization. In 1948 she chaired the U.N. Human Rights Commission, and under her leadership the General Assembly, meeting in Paris, passed, at 3:00 a.m. on December 10, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, still a landmark document.13. Alice Paul (1885 - 1977). Paul was the key organizer of the women's suffrage movement that led to the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. In January 1917, she organized the ""Silent Sentinels"" to protest President Wilson's refusal to support women's suffrage outside the White House. Following the U.S. entry into World War I, angry mobs attacked the protesters, and police began arresting them on the trumped-up charge of obstructing traffic. Sent to a prison in Virginia, Paul and her colleagues demanded to be treated as political prisoners and staged hunger strikes. Their jailers beat them and confined them to cold, unsanitary, rat-infested cells. The press reported on the suffragists' terrible experiences in prison, and politicians and activist groups demanded their release. The public outcry played a role in Wilson's decision in 1917 to reverse his stance and announce his support for a suffrage amendment. It passed three years later though Paul viewed that victory as only a first step. She drafted the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923 but had to wait almost 50 years -- until 1972 -- before Congress passed it, only to watch it die when too few states ratified it. In the 1930s and 1940s she worked with the League of Nations and then the United Nations to get those institutions to adopt the principle of gender equality. In the 1960s she spearheaded a coalition that added a sexual discrimination clause to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a landmark law that helped break down many barriers to women's equality. 14. Dorothy Day (1897-1980). Day founded the Catholic Worker movement, combining militant pacifism, radical economic redistribution and direct service to the poor, and creating houses in urban slums that provided food and shelter to the destitute. In 1933 Day and others opened the first Catholic Worker house in a Harlem storefront. They soon rented an apartment with space for 10 women, and then a place for men. Catholic Worker activists continued to participate in direct action as well as service. Within a few decades, the Catholic Worker had houses in most major cities. Although she was known to say, ""Don't call me a saint. I don't want to be dismissed so easily,"" many Catholics have tried to get Day canonized by the Catholic Church for her lifetime of social and spiritual activism.15. Margaret Mead (1901-1978). Mead was the world's best-known anthropologist and one of the first to look at human development in a cross-cultural perspective. Her many articles, books, lectures, and television appearances helped Americans understand and respect the wide variety of cultures and everyday practices around the world. She was particularly influential in explaining that there is no single thing called ""human nature"" and that different kinds of child rearing practices and gender roles can be equally valid. Her research and views about such social issues such as women's rights, child rearing, sexual morality, population control, environmental pollution and world hunger gained a wide audience.16. Ella Baker (1903-1986). Baker was probably the most influential, and the least-known, organizer within the civil rights movement, in large part because she believed in being a behind-the-scenes presence. In 1938, Baker started working for the NAACP, traveling throughout the South, recruiting new members, working with local leaders to strengthen their chapters, and helping them organize campaigns against lynching, for equal pay for black teachers, and for job training. Soon after the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott erupted, Baker, Bayard Rustin, and Stanley Levinson (a close adviser to Martin Luther King Jr.) used their connections with northern liberals and unions to establish In Friendship, which raised funds and provided support for the boycott campaign. After the Montgomery buses were desegregated, the three of them talked extensively with King about establishing a new organization to build similar campaigns throughout the South. This was the genesis of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which catapulted King from local to national leadership. In 1960 Baker helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a group that would soon expand the already growing lunch counter sit-in campaign, but also used other tactics, such as freedom rides and voter registration drives, to tear down segregation.17. Rachel Carson (1907-1964). Carson was a marine biologist and a reluctant activist. She became a household name when her 1962 book Silent Spring alerted the public to the dangers that pesticides (such as DDT) have on the environment and on health. Carson was a prolific and graceful writer who learned how to translate her understanding of scientific facts into works that raised public awareness about the natural world. Carson's work helped spark the modern environmental movement. In 1970, a few years after she died, Congress established the Environmental Protection Agency. Two years later, the federal government banned the use of DDT.18. Rosa Parks (1913-2005). In the popular legend, Parks is portrayed as a tired middle-aged seamstress in Montgomery, Alabama, who, at the spur of the moment after a hard day at work, decided to resist the city's segregation law by refusing to move to the back of the bus. She is typically revered as a selfless individual who, with one spontaneous act of courage, triggered the bus boycott and became, as she is often called, ""the mother of the civil rights movement."" That popular legend is misleading. Parks' defiance of Montgomery's segregation laws in 1955 was not an isolated incident. It was part of her lifelong crusade to dismantle Jim Crow. She was a veteran activist and part of a local movement whose leaders had been waiting for the right moment to launch a campaign against bus segregation.19. Fannie Lou Hamer (1917-1977). No one symbolized the civil rights movement better than Hamer, a charismatic and courageous plantation worker from rural Ruleville, Mississippi who galvanized the country with her stirring words and her remarkable courage. In 1964 Hamer was in the vanguard of Freedom Summer, educating and training busloads of idealistic volunteers, many of them college students, who came from the North to help register voters. That year, Hamer helped found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), a pivotal part of the movement's strategy to shine a national spotlight on the disenfranchisement of African Americans in the South. Their activism helped push President Lyndon Johnson and Congress to enact the Civil Rights Act in July 1964. The next month, MFDP sent an integrated delegation of 68 members, including Hamer, to represent Mississippi at the Democratic Party convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where she electrified the country with her testimony before the credentials committee. While unsuccessful, the battle in Atlantic City accelerated the civil rights movement's momentum. The next year, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act.20. Betty Friedan (1921-2006). Betty Friedan's 1963 book The Feminine Mystique catalyzed the modern feminist movement, helped change attitudes toward women's equality, and identified the ""problem that has no name"" (which feminists later labeled ""sexism""). She was also instrumental in organizing the National Organization for Women (NOW) and other influential groups that advocated women's equality. In 1971, a year after the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment, Friedan and other feminists formed the National Women's Political Caucus to encourage more women to participate in politics and run for office.Peter Dreier is professor of politics and chair of the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College. His most recent book is The 100 Greatest Americans of the 20th Century: A Social Justice Hall of Fame. An expanded version of this article, with longer profiles of each of the 20 women, was published in The American Prospect."

This March, Barbara Ortiz Howard and Susan Ades Stone started a campaign called Women on 20s to demand that the government replace former President Andrew Jackson's image on the $20 bill with a woman from history.Now, the Obama administration is following through, although not in the way that the two women and the many followers they galvanized had hoped. Last week, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced that in 2020 -- the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote -- a woman will appear on the $10 note, not the $20 bill. Lew explained that the $10 bill was already scheduled to be redesigned to deal with counterfeiting threats. The new currency will feature state-of-the-art security and composition features and will include a tactile element for the visually impaired. Lew hinted that Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first Treasury Secretary, will not disappear from the $10 note. Whatever woman is selected will be on some of the bills, while Hamilton will remain on others.""We've been asking for historic change, and this is the first step,"" Stone said. Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire introduced a bill in April to put a woman on the $20, shared Stone's mixed emotions: ""While it might not be the $20 bill, make no mistake, this is a historic announcement and a big step forward.""The new $10 note won't be the first time a woman has been featured on paper currency. In the 19th century, Martha Washington was featured on a dollar bill. And from 1865 to 1869, Pocahontas was part of a group photo featured on the $20 note.Lew, who has the final say in the matter, said that he will select ""a woman who has played a major role in our history who represents the theme of democracy."" The Treasury Department has created a website -- www.thenew10.treasury.gov -- for Americans to submit suggestions. Comments can also be submitted on Twitter using the hashtag #TheNew10. The public can propose both which woman should be chosen and which symbols of democracy should be included in the redesigned bill. ""We are asking the American people to tell us what democracy means to them,"" Lew said. ""Their feedback will shape what the new bill will look like.""To help in that effort, here are the names and brief biographies of 20 women who fought to make the United States a more humane country. They played key roles in the major movements for social justice throughout the nation's history. When they first advanced their ideas -- from abolishing slavery, to granting women the right to vote, to ending child labor, to giving workers the right to unionize, to protecting consumers from harmful products, to creating old age insurance and the minimum wage -- they were considered impractical idealists, utopian dreamers, or dangerous radicals. But now we take these ideas for granted. Although none of these 20 women were elected to office, they all had a great influence on public opinion and public policy. The reformers profiled below exercised influence not only because of the number of people they mobilized, but also because of the moral force of their ideas. They influenced Americans' attitudes about right and wrong, the treatment of different groups, and the responsibility of society to meet human needs. The law dictates that U.S. currency cannot feature a living person, so a number of women who belong in this pantheon of great reformers -- such as labor activist Dolores Huerta, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, feminist leader Gloria Steinem, and tennis star and women's rights crusader Billie Jean King -- do not yet quality.The women are listed chronologically by their date of birth. An expanded version of this article, with longer profiles of these 20 courageous women, can be found here. 1. Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906). Anthony was a leading abolitionist and suffragist. She was inspired to fight for women's rights while campaigning against alcohol. Denied a chance to speak at a temperance convention because she was a woman, she realized that no one would take women in politics seriously unless they had the right to vote. In 1872, she voted illegally in the presidential election. She was arrested for the crime, unsuccessfully fought the charges, was fined $100, but refused to pay it. She died before women got the vote through the 19th Amendment in 1920.2. Harriet Tubman (1822-1913). Born into slavery, Tubman was best known as an abolitionist and leader of the Underground Railroad, but she was also an outspoken advocate for granting women the right to vote. She is most well-known for being a conductor on the Underground Railroad. During a 10-year span she made 19 trips into the South and escorted over 300 slaves to freedom. She helped create an elaborate secret network of safe houses - -the Underground Railroad -- organized for that purpose. As she once proudly pointed out to fellow abolitionist Frederick Douglass, in all of her journeys she ""never lost a single passenger."" 3. Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902). Stanton was an abolitionist and leading figure of the early woman's rights movement. In July 1848, she helped organize the first major women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York. She drafted the ""Declaration of Sentiments"" and took the lead in proposing that women be granted the right to vote. Along with Susan B. Anthony, whom she met in the early 1850s, Stanton formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) in 1869. Stanton was the NWSA's first president--a position she held until 1890.4. Florence Kelley (1859-1932). Kelley did more than any other 20th century American to rectify the awful conditions of child labor. She was also a leading organizer against sweatshops and a pioneering advocate for working women. She helped lead the battle for groundbreaking local, state, and federal labor laws, including ones that established the minimum wage and the eight-hour day. Kelley, the longtime leader of the National Consumers League, was a path-breaker in conducting social and statistical research to expose workplace abuses and in developing strategies -- such as factory inspections and consumer organizing - - to pressure state legislatures and Congress to improve working conditions. 5. Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935). Gilman was a path breaking feminist, humanist, and socialist whose lectures, novels, short stories (including her most famous, ""The Yellow Wallpaper""), magazine articles, and nonfiction books challenged the dominant ideas about women's role in society and helped shape the movement for women's suffrage and women's rights. By the late 1800s, Gilman was the most important feminist thinker in the United States. She combined economic and sociological writings with fiction and utopian thinking, giving her a broad appeal.6. Jane Addams (1860-1935). The founder of the settlement house movement and of the American social work profession, Addams was an important Progressive Era urban reformer, a founder of the NAACP, a champion of women's suffrage, an anti-war crusader, and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. Addams carved out a new way for women to become influential in public affairs. In 1889 she and her college friend, Ellen Gates Starr (1859-1940), founded Hull House in one Chicago's immigrant slum neighborhoods, inspired by similar efforts she had seen in England. Hull House became the inspiration for hundreds of other settlement houses in cities across the country and helped establish the fields of both social work and community organizing.7. Ida B. Wells (1862-1931). Wells was an African-American journalist and activist who led the anti-lynching crusade in the United States in the 1890s. In May 1884, Wells purchased a first-class train ticket from Memphis to Nashville. The train's conductor ordered her to move to the car for African Americans. She refused and was forcibly removed from the train. She sued the railroad and won a $500 settlement in a circuit court, but that decision was overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1887. Outraged by her treatment and by the court ruling, Wells began to write about issues of racial injustice for the Negro Press Association. She soon became editor of a weekly paper, Evening Star, and then of Living Way, at first writing under a pseudonym, ""Iola."" Black newspapers around the country reprinted her articles. Wells' writing was part of a wave of investigative ""muckraking"" reporting that exposed social injustices. She used her paper to investigate and denounce lynching, and to encourage blacks to retaliate by boycotting white-owned businesses and the segregated public transportation system.8. Alice Hamilton (1869-1970). Hamilton was a physician whose patient was America's working class. She was a brilliant scientist and an untiring reformer who founded the field of occupational medicine, which has helped save tens of millions of workers from unnecessary workplace injuries, diseases, and deaths.

In an attempt to keep the session low key, the news media will not be allowed in.Bush has vowed to campaign in places where Republicans have not always gone in recent years, such as black churches and impoverished neighborhoods.President Barack Obama gave a speech in Charleston on Friday about racial differences in the United States at the funeral for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was among those shot to death.Hillary Clinton, who is the Democratic frontrunner for president, was among those at the funeral on Friday.While Florida governor, Bush engineered a move for the state to stop displaying the Confederate battle flag. A source familiar with the situation said Bush had consulted with South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in the days before she announced an effort this week to remove the flag from the grounds of the state capitol in Columbia."

11,RELIGION,Where Mormon Feminists Stand A Year After Kate Kelly's Excommunication,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mormon-feminists-excommunication_n_7647696.html,,2015-06-27,"Kate Kelly receives a hug from a supporter after walking to the Church Office Building of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sunday, June 22, 2014, in Salt Lake City. While Kelly's former church leaders meet in Virginia on Sunday night to decide if she'll be ousted from her church, the founder of a prominent Mormon women's group will hold a vigil in Salt Lake City along with hundreds of her supporters. The leader of Ordain Women is accused of apostasy, defined as repeated and public advocacy of positions that oppose church teachings. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb803b11f0000df00252fdf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nancy Ross was sitting next to Kate Kelly at an Ordain Women board meeting in Salt Lake City on June 23, 2014, when Kelly learned that she had been excommunicated from the LDS Church.Kelly began to tear up at the email from her Mormon bishop, and soon most of the nine or so board members around the table were weeping as well.“It was a truly awful day — with a lot of really big emotions,” Ross recalls. “A year later, it’s still an awful thing.”Until that moment, Ross says, many of the women who had pushed for female ordination — including those who had marched with Kelly to seek tickets to the male-only priesthood session — did not believe the church they loved would take such punitive actions.They were hopeful and, they conceded, naive.Beyond the tiny ordination camp, however, many Mormon feminists also experienced Kelly’s excommunication as a harsh slap felt around the world, not just to the activist, but to them all. They were shocked, horrified and discouraged that their carefully constructed building blocks of progressive LDS history seemed to have been toppled with a single blow.“It’s taken me about a year to really recover emotionally and spiritually,” Ross says, “to gain perspective and to create some distance from the upset and anger and big emotions that day produced.”In the succeeding 12 months, Kelly has moved to Kenya, lost appeals to regain her church membership, worked for women’s rights in Somalia, written opinion pieces for several newspapers, retained her seat on Ordain Women (OW) board and posted statements on its website.Meanwhile, OW has uploaded more supportive profiles on its site, produced photos of women involved in imaginary healing blessings and promoted actions to educate and push Mormons toward greater gender equity.The group plans a couple of unspecified mass actions on a July 24 Pioneer Day service at the Mormon Tabernacle and along the Days of ’47 Parade route in Salt Lake City.Most observers, whether they support female ordination or not, credit OW with triggering wider conversations about women in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.But the group’s executive board, which has turned over almost entirely since Kelly’s excommunication, and its backers also have paid a price — in time, religious respectability and church standing. Some have lost callings, temple access, even friends.South Jordan resident April Young Bennett, heeding her local LDS leader’s demand, chose to resign from OW’s board rather than lose the ability to attend her brother’s temple wedding. Kristy Money learned this week she faces possible church discipline from her Atlanta area bishop on charges of apostasy for her writings and work with the group.Whether from fear, burnout or altered perspectives, some have stepped away from the organization, some have quietly withdrawn their profiles, some have a different view of women’s priesthood altogether.And, for some, Kelly’s post-excommunication persona and actions have created divisions over leadership and tactics.Most, however, still prize the ultimate goal: female ordination.“I do not think that the excommunication itself did a lot to thwart or enhance the ordination cause,” says Suzette Smith, a former OW board member who continues to promote ordination. “The people who supported Kate still do; those who were opposed still are.”Smith, a Virginia-based businesswoman, loves OW for bringing the issue “to the forefront.” No other feminists, she says, “do it as conscientiously, deliberately or as focused as OW does.”Still, different approaches have “been positive for the ordination cause,” Smith says. “That spreads the effort out among different voices so people hear it and understand in a variety of ways.”A year ago, though, Kelly had by far the loudest, most quoted voice — and she suffered the deepest wound.Kelly, a returned Mormon missionary and D.C.-based human-rights lawyer sporting signature specs and a conservative but quirky fashion sense, sprang into public awareness with the arrival of Ordain Women’s website in March 2013.Months before, Kelly had reached out to a network of Mormon feminists that had been working for gender-based equality for decades. Her first call in January 2013 was to Lorie Winder Stromberg, a California Mormon who had been talking about women’s issues since the 1980s and had more recently created an online petition, “All Are Alike Unto God,” to spell out possible changes, including ordination.In a series of conversations with feminist friends, Kelly became convinced that “whatever her goal, it had to be actionable,” Stromberg writes in a forthcoming book of essays from various authors titled “Voices for Equality: Ordain Women and Resurgent Mormon Feminism.”And the action had to be big.Kelly suggested unfurling a banner for women’s ordination over a balcony in a session of the April 2013 LDS General Conference, Stromberg writes, but ultimately opted for trying to get tickets to the all-male priesthood session.Once the group settled on the name Ordain Women and the website, the question became: Shall we allow nonparticipating, nonbelieving members or former members to post profiles?Kelly was against it, but others swayed her and thus the site was born and open to all.Today, about 650 such profiles appear, with about 70 percent to 80 percent coming from active Mormons, Money says.After Kelly’s excommunication, about a dozen asked to withdraw their posts.The decision to open it to all interested parties, no matter their church status, was sound, Kelly acknowledges, since she now falls into the “former” category.And, for better or worse, she remains the face of the movement.When Kelly and her husband, Neil Ransom, arrived in Nairobi a few months after her church ouster, the pair went to an LDS ward, or congregation, there for a few weeks.The Mormons were friendly and didn’t really understand her disciplining, Kelly says. A church employee there said he would resign rather than excommunicate her.Since then, the couple have stopped attending and when the faith’s governing First Presidency rejected Kelly’s final appeal, Ransom resigned his membership.“I don’t know where my path will lead me,” Kelly says in a phone interview. “My spirituality in many ways is less restrained. … My excommunication has freed me from the in-or-out, black-or-white mentality many Mormons have and that the church demands.”Not much has changed in her daily behavior.“My marriage is not breaking down. I am a basic moral personal,” she says. “I don’t have any reason not to go out and drink and do all these other things, but I’ve realized it wasn’t because of Mormonism. It’s a strange process of sussing out what you really value.”The day after being booted from the church, for example, Kelly was photographed in a sleeveless shirt. (LDS leaders instruct excommunicated members to stop wearing Mormon temple garments that cover a woman’s shoulder.)“Is a capped sleeve better than a tank top?” Kelly laughs, calling the ruckus “dress-gate.” “Those are the kinds of things I am going through the process of discovering. But I’ll probably never drink a cup of coffee. I don’t even like the smell of coffee.”She keeps a keen eye on the continuing campaign and the choices confronting her allies. Bennett, for example, gave up her OW board membership rather than her LDS temple recommend.“It’s not the decision I would have made, but what a …terrible position [she was in],” Kelly says. “That is the stuff of totalitarian regimes.”Kelly made a similar point in February 2015, writing in The Guardian that “since strict obedience is demanded and harshly enforced, only the least talented, least articulate, least nuanced thinkers, least likely to take a stand against abuse, and the least courageous people thrive in the church today.”Though the statement alienated some LDS supporters, Kelly stands by it. “It was taken as an insult to all active members, but it was intended as more of a statement about the institution.”Kelly withdrew from the “Voices for Equality” book, explaining that she felt she wouldn’t have “enough input.”“If you have experienced a traumatic event, part of taking back your power is the ability to control your narrative and own that story,” Kelly says. “The organization is just 2 years old. … Doing a history seems extremely premature. I am still making the history to write about.”OW galvanized a feminist drive that had been building for decades.“In some ways, Ordain Women tested the bounds of faithful dissent, “ Stromberg says, “with some tolerating and even supporting [dissent] and others disciplining women.”LDS leaders knew what they were doing by punishing Kelly, says Money, who could meet a similar fate.“It was strategic to paint us as apostates,” Money says.”They wanted to contain the movement. And while that did not happen, OW supporters have received a lot of pushback from families and wards.”At the same time, Mormon feminists also have become “braver and bolder,” she says. They know how high the stakes are and “how wrong Kate’s excommunication was.”Ross, who left OW’s board because of the time commitment, believes the public conversation is beginning to change minds.The St. George professional is hopeful, she says, and “it’s not the hope of fools.”"

The Pete Docter-directed film has earned stupendous reviews and even scored the best-ever domestic opening for an original film. It's no secret that kids' movies often attempt to keep the over-12 crowd awake, but Pixar goes beyond the typical lightly adult innuendo to tackle themes like nostalgia, regret and parenthood. Here are eight of Pixar's most grown-up moments, in chronological order:Contains spoilers for some Pixar films.1. ""Toy Story 2"": ""When She Loved Me"" Montage The montage is a pretty standard cinematic move, but rarely is it executed with as much heft and genuine feeling as this one from ""Toy Story 2."" Jessie, Woody's cowgirl counterpart, recounts the youth and adolescence of her beloved playmate Emily, who eventually grows up and loses interest in her toys. It has everything a sad montage could possibly need: a meditation on the passage of time, a loss of childlike imagination and Sarah McLachlan singing a song called ""When She Loved Me."" 2. ""Monsters, Inc."": Boo Is Terrified Of Sully Many of Pixar's most emotional moments revolve around some form of parent-child relationship (in this case, the pseudo-adoptive-monster-human-parent-child relationship). After Sully inadvertently scares Boo, the tiny, pigtailed girl who infiltrated his monster world, she recoils from her beloved ""Kitty"" in horror. Sully struggles to regain her trust while also trying to protect her, himself and his livelihood. A movie about the exploitation of childhood fears taps into some very real anxieties.3. ""Finding Nemo"": Dory Gives Marlin Some Solid Life Advice Though the title clownfish is a child, the real protagonist of the film is Nemo's dad, Marlin, who searches the Pacific Ocean to find his missing son. Marlin -- whose wife and hundreds of unborn eggs perish early in the movie -- is understandably uptight and a bit of a pessimist. Just when all seems lost, his traveling companion Dory gives him some timeless, universal advice: ""Just keep swimming!"" That mantra resonates with audiences of all ages -- and cynical grown-ups might just be the ones most in need of a catchy reassurance.4. ""The Incredibles"": Bob And Helen Work On Their Marriage On paper, ""The Incredibles"" might seem like standard superhero fare. But, as Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers put it, ""It's not every toon that deals with midlife crisis, marital dysfunction, child neglect, impotence fears, fashion faux pas and existential angst."" The film's emphasis on ""marital dysfunction"" in particular is a strange, nuanced choice for a kids' movie. Bob and Helen Parr (Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, respectively) manage to save the world -- and their marriage.5. ""Wall-E"": Pretty Much The Whole Movie ""Wall-E"" must have been a tough sell for young audiences (So it's a mostly silent meditation on consumer culture and the inevitable, dystopian ends of human materialism...). But the resulting film is a masterpiece, a perfect marriage of enormous visual scale and detailed characterization. The nearly silent opening section of the movie, in particular, shows how absurdly good the studio is at telling stories, though this one is probably most appreciated by those with a grown-up attention span.6. ""Up"": Carl Reflects On Life With EllieIf the power of a film can be measured in audience tears, then ""Up"" was arguably one of the greatest movies of all time. But even if that's a statistically shaky metric, Pixar's 2009 hit proved itself as an adventure flick with a seriously sad streak. The loss of a spouse is a pretty heavy emotional throughline for a children's movie, but ""Up"" carries it off with just the right amount of levity -- no pun intended. When Carl reads the message Ellie left for him in their scrapbook (""Thanks for the adventure -- now go have a new one!""), Pixar wrings the final tears from its deeply felt account of grief, acceptance and talking dogs.7. ""Toy Story 3"": Andy Gives Away His Childhood ToysFor a few moments, it seemed plausible that this children's franchise would end with the brutal murder of all of its main characters. But after Woody and the gang escape from the fiery furnace of doom, they're met with a much more subtle, bittersweet fate. When Andy gives his childhood toys to Bonnie, plays with them one last time, and then heads off to college, the trilogy reaches its brilliant, satisfying conclusion. So obviously they're making a fourth one.8. ""Inside Out"": Riley Gets Sad ""Inside Out"" captures the exact moment in preteen-hood when internal life becomes an incomprehensible mess. Sadness, the unexpected hero of the film, manages to teach a lesson in good emotional health while moping around the inside of Riley's mind. It will be easier to gauge the importance of that creative choice once we all stop crying."

19,WORLDPOST,What Iranians Really Think About The Nuclear Negotiations,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran-nuclear-talks_n_7665232.html,,2015-06-27,"People flash the 'V for Victory' sign as they celebrate on Valiasr street in northern Tehran on April 2, 2015, after the announcement of an agreement on Iran nuclear talks. Iran and global powers sealed a deal on April 2 on plans to curb Tehran's chances for getting a nuclear bomb, laying the ground for a new relationship between the Islamic republic and the West. AFP PHOTO / ATTA KENARE (Photo credit should read ATTA KENARE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1516b2300003200d0ca3b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving world headlines. This time, we speak with Trita Parsi, the founder and president of the National Iranian American Council, about the Iran nuclear talks.After years of painstaking negotiations, Iran and six world powers are nearing a self-imposed deadline to conclude a deal that would restrict Iran's nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions relief.Negotiators from Iran and the P5+1, made up of the United Nations Security Council's five permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- and Germany, have set a  June 30 deadline for a final nuclear agreement. It's possible they won't reach a deal until after the deadline, as in previous rounds of negotiations. Yet as it has approached, there have been ominous warnings and tough talk on both sides, with major disagreements over the pace and scope of sanctions relief and how to monitor the deal. This week, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected several U.S. demands, and an Iranian constitutional body enshrined some of these objections in law. Meanwhile, a group of U.S. President Barack Obama’s former top aides wrote an open letter warning that the deal currently under discussion may not go far enough. As the talks enter their final stages, The WorldPost spoke to the National Iranian American Council's Trita Parsi about how Iranians perceive the nuclear negotiations.When Iran and the P5+1 announced they reached a framework deal in April, there were scenes of celebration in Tehran. Is the attitude in the country still optimistic?The optimism remains. There is a lot of support for the deal in Iran. People are just waiting for it to happen.All the public posturing that is going on right now could give people a reason to pause. Both sides are negotiating in public. But we’ve been through this circus a few times already, and people recognize these patterns. It doesn’t mean that the talks will fail, but it could indicate the potential for a delay in reaching a deal. This would be problematic, because Iranians have been waiting so long for the economic benefits of a deal. Extending the talks at this time is particularly difficult because it would double the amount of time Congress has to approve the deal, and this gives all the opponents of a deal more time to disrupt it.What are you going to sanction next, oxygen?How have Iranians reacted to the supreme leader’s recently hardened stance on the talks? Are the talks a divisive issue in Iran?The polls show that people want a deal, but they want a good deal which treats Iran’s independence with respect. The restrictions on Iran’s missile capabilities and insistence on international access to military sites create unease, because there is not a lot of confidence in the West inside Iran. People oppose limitations on nuclear research, because they are not keen on the idea of the international community ruling that Iran cannot expand its scientific base. There is a still a narrative in Iran that the West has tried to keep Iran uneducated.People are also uneasy about the idea of the West asking for access to Iranian military sites. These are things that only a country that is defeated in war would give up. And Iran has not been defeated in war.The negotiators will have a hard time selling the deal if the Iranian public thinks that they gave too many concessions to the American side. Do you see any parallels between the debate in the U.S. and the debate in Iran about a nuclear deal?Congress recently passed legislation restricting the deal, and now Iran’s Parliament has done the same thing. Yet despite the differences, people on both sides are generally optimistic, as they know this is just a part of the negotiations. It is even more tense this time because it is the final round. In fact, both sides want the stories of high drama and tension to leak out so they can show their own constituencies how hard they negotiated.Have people in Iran been preparing for economic and political changes if a deal is reached?People are ready for a deal. The problem is that they have exaggerated expectations of how fast things can change -- how fast sanctions can be lifted and when they will feel the impact of sanctions relief. There will be a problem of expectation management.How would an Iran nuclear deal affect political dynamics inside Iran? What if the talks fail?If there is a deal, in the mid and long term we’ll see Iran going in a more moderate direction, because a deal will strengthen the people advocating for that path. The incentive structure will change. The costs of Iran’s actions in the world will become higher because Iran will now have something to lose. Now, Iran is so outside of the economic and political structures of the region, there is little disincentive. What are you going to sanction next, oxygen?The deal could also strengthen a middle class in Iran whose welfare is dependent on relationships with the outside world. If Iran risks those relations, this would come at a price, including for some parts of the Iranian elite.If there is no deal, the challenge will be to retain national unity. But it depends on how the deal falls apart. If the deal collapses because of access to military sites, it would be possible for Iran to blame the failure on the U.S. If Congress sabotages the deal, that might undermine the international sanctions regime and put Europe in a tough position. This could be the beginning of a lot of taboos being knocked down one by one.Whether they reach a deal or not, do you think the talks have changed the political conversation inside Iran about relations with the U.S. and the rest of the world?Absolutely. At the end of the day, dialogue between the U.S. and Iran has been a taboo in both countries for a long time. In Washington, suggesting talks with Iran went against the political consensus. In Tehran, you could be jailed for these suggestions.Now [U.S. Secretary of State] John Kerry has spent more time with Iran’s foreign minister than any other foreign minister in the world. Iran’s supreme leader has said these talks could lead to dialogue on other issues of concern. These are a sign of changes, and hopefully they are irreversible changes. There has been a surprisingly open debate in Iran about the nuclear talks in recent months. This could be the beginning of a lot of taboos being knocked down one by one. People in Iran are eager to shed the image of Iran as a rogue nation, to be able to travel around the world on an Iranian passport, and to have a sense of normalcy. Iran’s sense of isolation is a profound anomaly. This is a country that has been at the center of affairs in the Middle East for 3,000 years. To accept being an outsider runs counter to Iran’s identity in a way that is not the case for North Korea, for example. The culture of Iran is built on openness to outsiders.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series: "
20,POLITICS,It Only Took 5 Months For Billionaire Donors To Set New Records,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/billionaire-gop-donors_n_7673950.html,,2015-06-27,"WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 02: American businessman Sheldon Adelson (R) applauds during a roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill with his wie Miriam Adelson (C) and Marion Wiesel (L) March 2, 2015 in Washington, DC. Elie Wiesel, Sen. Ted Cruz and Rabbi Scmuley Boteach participated in a discussion entitled 'The Meaning of Never Again: Guarding Against a Nuclear Iran.' (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb9022b2400003200577f3d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- It only took five months before the top donor to candidates, political party committees and political action committees in 2015 surpassed the giving of all top donors from the previous election cycle. This radical change in the amounts a single donor can give is all thanks to new contribution limits Congress slipped into the end-of-year omnibus budget legislation passed in December.Warren Stephens, the owner of the Arkansas-based investment firm Stephens Inc., has given at least $800,000 in limited contributions to candidates, party committees and PACs through the end of May, according to a review of Federal Election Commission records. This total only includes contributions to committees accepting limited contributions (known as “hard money”) and excludes unlimited super PAC donations (known as “soft money”).A perennial top donor to Republican Party politicians and political committees, Stephens gave $265,400 to politicians, party committees and PACs in 2014, which made him among the top 100 donors that year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. His $800,000 tops the more than $570,000 that hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer gave over the entire 2014 election cycle. (These totals don't even include giving to candidates after March, as the next disclosure date for candidates is July 15.)This dramatic rise in individuals' limited contributions is a consequence of the creation of new party fundraising accounts for the six national party committees included in the spending bill. The omnibus spending bill created a new account for building expenses within all six committees, and another for expenses related to a party nominating convention for the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee. It also expanded the limits to the recount accounts held by all six. While donors are limited to giving $33,400 per year to a national party committee, the limits for these new or expanded accounts were set at $100,200. In total, a single donor can now give $801,600 per year to the party of their choice.Donor giving has also increased thanks to the 2013 McCutcheon v. FEC ruling that invalidated aggregate campaign contributions limits. Previously, donors were capped from giving more than $123,300 in one election cycle to candidates, party committees and PACs. (These limits did not apply to super PAC giving.)The new accounts were seen by both parties as a way of shoring up their finances in an age when super PACs and nonprofits were sucking up unlimited funds.Stephens is not alone among donors in pouring money into these new accounts. Singer, the top limited contribution donor in 2014, has also surpassed his past total, with $657,700 donated this year. Another hedge fund honcho, Citadel’s Ken Griffin, is nearly there, with $560,400 donated this year. Both Singer and Griffin are Republicans.Other big-time donors splurging on the new party accounts include GOP donors like casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam Adelson; billionaire coal titan Joseph Craft; Western Refining head Paul Foster and his wife Alejandra Foster; Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks; billionaire David Koch; and wealthy investors like Bruce Kovner, David Herro, Muneer Satter, Bob Mercer, Seth Klarman, Henry Kravis and John Childs.Republican committees have taken advantage of the new party accounts far more than Democratic ones. The three Republican committees have raised a combined $13.4 million to just $1.2 million for the three Democratic committees. This difference pushes the gap in fundraising between the two parties from $12 million in favor of Republicans without the new accounts, to nearly $25 million with them.This gap will allow the Republican Party to spend money from the new accounts on upgrading the party’s headquarters and infrastructure without having to divert funds away from its electoral efforts.The seeming inability of Democratic Party committees to get their stable of big donors to contribute to their new accounts comes after the party worked to create the accounts. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s lawyer Marc Elias was tasked with negotiating the new accounts and new limits to be included in the omnibus bill even though there was no public push or discussion on the matter beforehand. The inclusion of the new accounts with the support of Senate Democrats came as a surprise and was openly opposed at the time by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.After the bill passed, Pelosi wrote to her House colleagues, ""The inclusion of the outrageous campaign contribution provision gives further evidence of the need for campaign finance reform, and an opportunity for advancing initiatives to empower small donors and all American voters."""

""So, until that's something that everyone can join into with no sense of being left out on any level, politically, emotionally, it's just not something that we're gonna do.""  On Friday, with SCOTUS voting 5-4 to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, a Dunham-Antonoff wedding became a lot more possible. Other stars have expressed similar sentiments about holding off on marriage in support of same-sex couples, like Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, and Charlize Theron. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt also said they'd wait, but wound up saying ""I do"" last year. "

But even the rapper has regrets, and believes he's to blame for what's missing from his life.  In a new interview with Q magazine, the 38-year-old reveals he feels responsible for the death of his mother Donda West, who died of heart disease while suffering ""multiple post-operative factors"" following liposuction and breast-reduction surgery in 2007. When asked what he feels he's sacrificed the most to achieve his level of success, West replied, ""My mom."" ""If I had never moved to LA she'd be alive. I don't want to go far into it because it will bring me to tears,"" West told the magazine. It's a sentiment the rapper has expressed before. In 2008, he released the song ""Pinocchio Story,"" in which he says he says he would give up everything he's achieved to have his mother back, and in 2010, when he guested-edited the October issue of XXL magazine and wrote, ""When I moved to LA, she moved to LA. And she wound up in a place that would eat her alive. Even if I stayed in New York, it wouldn’t have been like that. If I had lived in New York, she’d still be here.” West seems truly haunted by his mother's death, but now that he's a father to 2-year-old daughter North and is expecting a son in December with his wife, Kim Kardashian, it seems he's all about putting family first.  ""While [Nori's] here in Europe I have to have six hours a day with her because otherwise I'll just work and she'll get scheduled around meetings,"" he explained to Q magazine. ""Instead, the meetings get scheduled around her."""

Ryan Cherlin (L) kisses his boyfriend Jared Stalzer in front of the Stonewall Inn. They said they had no plans to marry. (Michael Luongo/The GroundTruth Project)""Our work is far from over -- not in the United States and not around the world. Marriage equality is one slice of the pie, but homophobia and transphobia morph into different shapes in law and practice. Nearly 80 countries still criminalize same-sex intimacy and countless prohibit so-called 'cross-dressing,' said Jessica Stern, the executive director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC). ""Today is not an end but a new beginning.""The U.S. joins just 20 other countries worldwide to recognize gay marriage, while 78 countries still discriminate against and criminalize homosexuality itself with punishments of jail or even death. Broadly speaking, countries in North and South America, as well as Western Europe have led the charge toward equality, with much of Africa and the Middle East vehemently opposed to homosexuality. In East Africa, for example, religious organizations have pushed forward more restrictive laws on LGBTs. Russia flaunted new laws limiting freedom of expression for gay people ahead of and during the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, while gay Egyptians have abandoned their Arab Spring dreams of free association following arrests and intimidation.Many citizens of the countries that legalized gay marriage long before the U.S. expressed congratulations but also pointed out that this was a long time coming, particularly from a nation that the world views as a leader in human rights.And precisely because the U.S. is believed to hold such global influence, international LGBT rights advocates are asking the American government to go beyond just setting an example and actually send a clear, direct message through its foreign policy.The American Jewish World Service (AJWS), a Jewish international development and human rights organization, urged President Obama to reform foreign aid spending to ""ensure that U.S. tax dollars are not being used to subsidize discrimination abroad, so that people in developing countries are not denied lifesaving services on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.""A queer woman from the Middle East who wishes to remain anonymous told The GroundTruth project that she did not expect America to stand up for gay rights abroad, particularly when ""assimilation of gays in the West is used to demonize Muslims and Middle Easterners"" in order to maintain a narrative that supports current U.S. foreign policy. Besides, she said, ""Saudi Arabia declared just a few days ago that it would never grant gay rights. I don't see the U.S. ending relations with the Kingdom anytime soon.""The U.S. has enforced such measures in the past, but only in select countries.Meanwhile, on a day that mass attacks in Syria, Somalia, Tunisia, Kuwait, and France dominated international news, citizens of those countries found it difficult to celebrate, when there were more pressing matters affecting their countries beyond marriage equality, an issue which seemed far removed for them.The U.S. ruling in favor of gay marriage was already supported by a majority (57 percent) public opinion. But internationally, it appears that social stigma is the bigger obstacle that global LGBT advocates must overcome. Even in countries where homosexuality is legal, like Turkey, discrimination is part and parcel of society. For example, The GroundTruth Project's Middle East correspondent Lauren Bohn reports that 84 percent of Turkey's population does not want LGBT neighbors, forcing LGBT Turks to lead double lives.Still, legal action does set precedents, as seen when Uganda proposed a law that would condemn homosexuals to death. Politicians in Kenya and many other African countries are following suit at an alarming pace, reports Jacob Kushner, GroundTruth's Africa correspondent. As a result, many LGBT Africans are forced to become refugees, but no matter where they flee, they're not safe. Follow The GroundTruth Project for more reporting on the global struggle for gay rights."

Nearly 80 countries still criminalize same-sex intimacy and countless prohibit so-called 'cross-dressing,' said Jessica Stern, the executive director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC). ""Today is not an end but a new beginning.""The U.S. joins just 20 other countries worldwide to recognize gay marriage, while 78 countries still discriminate against and criminalize homosexuality itself with punishments of jail or even death. Broadly speaking, countries in North and South America, as well as Western Europe have led the charge toward equality, with much of Africa and the Middle East vehemently opposed to homosexuality. In East Africa, for example, religious organizations have pushed forward more restrictive laws on LGBTs. Russia flaunted new laws limiting freedom of expression for gay people ahead of and during the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, while gay Egyptians have abandoned their Arab Spring dreams of free association following arrests and intimidation.Many citizens of the countries that legalized gay marriage long before the U.S. expressed congratulations but also pointed out that this was a long time coming, particularly from a nation that the world views as a leader in human rights.And precisely because the U.S. is believed to hold such global influence, international LGBT rights advocates are asking the American government to go beyond just setting an example and actually send a clear, direct message through its foreign policy.The American Jewish World Service (AJWS), a Jewish international development and human rights organization, urged President Obama to reform foreign aid spending to ""ensure that U.S. tax dollars are not being used to subsidize discrimination abroad, so that people in developing countries are not denied lifesaving services on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.""A queer woman from the Middle East who wishes to remain anonymous told The GroundTruth project that she did not expect America to stand up for gay rights abroad, particularly when ""assimilation of gays in the West is used to demonize Muslims and Middle Easterners"" in order to maintain a narrative that supports current U.S. foreign policy. Besides, she said, ""Saudi Arabia declared just a few days ago that it would never grant gay rights. I don't see the U.S. ending relations with the Kingdom anytime soon.""The U.S. has enforced such measures in the past, but only in select countries.Meanwhile, on a day that mass attacks in Syria, Somalia, Tunisia, Kuwait, and France dominated international news, citizens of those countries found it difficult to celebrate, when there were more pressing matters affecting their countries beyond marriage equality, an issue which seemed far removed for them.The U.S. ruling in favor of gay marriage was already supported by a majority (57 percent) public opinion. But internationally, it appears that social stigma is the bigger obstacle that global LGBT advocates must overcome. Even in countries where homosexuality is legal, like Turkey, discrimination is part and parcel of society. For example, The GroundTruth Project's Middle East correspondent Lauren Bohn reports that 84 percent of Turkey's population does not want LGBT neighbors, forcing LGBT Turks to lead double lives.Still, legal action does set precedents, as seen when Uganda proposed a law that would condemn homosexuals to death. Politicians in Kenya and many other African countries are following suit at an alarming pace, reports Jacob Kushner, GroundTruth's Africa correspondent. As a result, many LGBT Africans are forced to become refugees, but no matter where they flee, they're not safe.

German Chancellor urged Greeceto accept an 'extraordinarily generous' offer from its EU-IMF creditors, which includes at least 12 billion euros ($13.4 billion) in further rescue cash over the next five months. AFP PHOTO/ JOHN THYS (Photo credit should read JOHN THYS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc151b6240000320076f643.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Lefteris Papadimas and Renee MaltezouATHENS/BRUSSELS, June 27 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called a referendum on austerity demands from foreign creditors on Saturday, rejecting an ""ultimatum"" from lenders and putting a deal that could determine Greece's future in Europe to a popular vote.The surprise call marked the most dramatic twist yet in five-month negotiations between Greece and its lenders, plunging the cash-strapped nation into uncharted waters and risking a default and capital controls as hopes for an agreement faded.""Our responsibility is for the future of our country. This responsibility obliges us to respond to the ultimatum through the sovereign will of the Greek people,"" Tsipras said in a televised address to the nation just after midnight.Euro zone finance ministers were still due to meet at 1200 GMT (1400 CET) in Brussels to discuss the aid offer from the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund, just after the Greek parliament meets to approve the referendum decision.Germany's Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel urged Greece to reach a deal with creditors to give Greeks something to vote on.""We'd be well advised not to dismiss this suggestion from Herr Tsipras out of hand and say 'that's just a trick',"" Gabriel told Deutschlandfunk radio. ""But rather if the questions are clearly framed... then that could make sense.""Tsipras, the 40-year-old novice prime minister, said he would respect the outcome of the vote. But he argued the lenders demands ""clearly violate European social rules and fundamental rights,"" would asphyxiate Greece's flailing economy and aimed at the ""humiliation of the entire Greek people.""Government ministers emerging from the cabinet meeting in Athens said they were confident Greeks would vote no and reject the bailout demands, leaving open the question as to whether the country had other options beside leaving the euro. QUEUES AT BANKSThe referendum call puts the country's banking system into focus, though a deputy minister said there were no plans to impose capital controls and banks would open on Monday.Soon after the address in the early hours of the morning, lines of up to 10 people were seen forming to withdraw cash from automated teller machines in some parts of Athens. Small groups of anti-establishment protesters threw petrol bombs and stones at police in an Athens neighborhood where protests are common.The euro zone had offered to release billions in frozen aid if Greece accepted and implemented pension and tax reforms that are anathema to its leftist government, elected in January on a promise to end austerity.Without the bailout funds, Athens is due to default on 1.6 billion euros in repayments to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, pushing Greece closer to being forced out of the euro, causing chaos for its economy and financial markets.A default would not necessarily lead to Athens leaving the 19-nation single currency area, but is expected to pave the way for it, worrying European leaders who fear it would undermine the principle that membership is irrevocable.Tsipras said he would ask euro zone finance ministers for an extension of Greece's bailout program that ends on Tuesday by a few days to accommodate the referendum.He also spoke with European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to discuss the referendum, and senior government officials were due to meet the ECB chief later on Saturday.With Greece's stricken banking sector dependent on central bank funds to remain afloat, the ECB will play a vital role in keeping the system on its feet over the next few days.Opposition parties attacked the government, saying the Tsipras's hardline stance had brought Greece to its knees.""Tsipras brought the country to a total deadlock. Between an unacceptable agreement and a euro exit,"" former conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said. The referendum question was effectively a ""yes"" or ""no"" to Europe, he said. A 15.5 BLN EURO DILEMMAThis is not the first time that Greece has flirted with a referendum in recent years. Former Prime Minister George Papandreou sought one in 2011 as he struggled to impose painful cuts demands by lenders, but was ousted over the call and his administration replaced by a government of technocrats.The latest drama came after weeks of phone calls, face-to-face-discussions and several rounds of meetings among European leaders to sort out Greece's troubles. In the latest round, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande met Tsipras on the sidelines of an EU summit to coax him to accept an offer to fill Athens' empty coffers until November in return for painful reforms.Both she and Hollande said Saturday's meeting of euro zone finance ministers would be the decisive moment for a deal since time was running out to secure German parliamentary approval in time to release funds needed to avert a Greek default.The creditors laid out terms in a document handed to Greece on Thursday. It said Athens could have 15.5 billion euros in EU and IMF funding in four installments to see it through to the end of November, including 1.8 billion euros by Tuesday as soon as the Greek parliament approved the plan.The total is barely more than what Greece needs to service its debts over the next six months and contains no new money. Further funding would require a third bailout program, which is politically impossible for the moment in Athens and Berlin.The lenders also made a gesture towards Tsipras' demands for debt relief by offering to reaffirm a 2012 pledge to consider stretching out loan maturities, lowering interest rates and extending an interest payment moratorium on euro zone loans to Greece, a senior EU official said.But the demands come at the price of pension cutbacks, new reductions in public sector salaries, an increase in taxes on food, eateries and tourism, and elimination of tax breaks on tourist islands. That has sparked protests in Greece, where one in four people are out of work.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is now calling for Supreme Court justices to face elections. In a National Review op-ed published Friday, Cruz chastised the high court for its decisions to reject a major challenge to Obamacare and to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. ""Both decisions were judicial activism, plain and simple,"" Cruz writes. ""Both were lawless.""To challenge that ""judicial activism,"" Cruz said he is proposing a constitutional amendment to require Supreme Court justices to face retention elections every eight years.""The decisions that have deformed our constitutional order and have debased our culture are but symptoms of the disease of liberal judicial activism that has infected our judiciary,"" Cruz writes. ""A remedy is needed that will restore health to the sick man in our constitutional system. Rendering the justices directly accountable to the people would provide such a remedy.""Under Cruz's proposed amendment, justices would have to be approved by a majority of American voters as well as by the majority of voters in least half of the states. If they failed to reach the required approval rating, they would be removed from office and barred from serving on the Supreme Court in the future.Cruz, who is running for president in 2016, was among many Republican candidates criticizing the justices after a strong week for liberals at the court.Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who is expected to jump in the presidential race soon, also offered up a proposed constitutional fix to combat the Supreme Court's marriage equality decision. In a statement, Walker argued for an amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman -- a proposal Cruz has also floated."

Parents can also take 12 more weeks of unpaid leave. The company, which employs 339,000 people in 197 countries, will offer one paid week of paternity leave to new fathers who are not primary caretakers as well. The policy will go into effect starting next year.The change will radically benefit Nestle's 51,000 U.S. employees. “This is a huge difference in our current policy,"" Judy Cascapera, the chief people officer at Nestlé USA, told The Huffington Post. Nestlé also announced flexible working arrangements to allow a new parent to phase back into work.The multibillion-dollar company, which makes everything from skincare products to dog food to chocolate, joins a handful of other large companies that have extended benefits this year, including Vodafone, Johnson & Johnson and Blackstone. Even the U.S. Navy in May proposed doubling the amount of maternity leave it offers to 12 weeks.For the momentum at the corporate level, you can thank the falling unemployment rate and the growing advancement of women in the workplace. Extending leave generally leads to better retention rates for women -- up to a certain point. Before Google expanded its maternity leave benefit to five paid months, women quit at twice the rate of men at the company. Now, the rate is the same. Cascapera said the change happened because the company wanted to improve the lives of its workers, who often struggle to manage work and family. In an interview with Fortune, Nestlé Chief Executive Paul Bulcke highlighted breastfeeding as a key reason to offer mothers more leave.“We support breastfeeding as the best way,” he said. “We should allow mothers that are employees to live up to that.”The emphasis on breastfeeding is of note, since Nestle has long been criticized for promoting its formula to new mothers, particularly in the developing world -- at times with dire consequences. ""There's lots of options for getting your baby the right nutrition, breastfeeding is best but not everybody can do that,"" said Cascapera.The U.S. is the only advanced economy that doesn’t offer some kind of paid leave -- instead guaranteeing 12 weeks unpaid leave to those who work for companies with 50 or more employees. Companies and policymakers have long resisted offering paid benefits.There are signs of change, as Claire Cain Miller recently reported in The New York Times. At the local level, advocates for paid leave now say they're seeing some momentum.This year, a handful of cities started offering parental leave. Only three states currently offer some -- California, New Jersey and Rhode Island. And only 13 percent of workers in the U.S. get paid parental leave."

No longer is it enough to simply catch a foul ball. Nowadays, you need to catch it in a way that separates you from the crowd, that temporarily elevates you from mere baseball fan to something akin to viral legend.Was it Sportscenter that did this? The Internet? The evolution of man? Obama? No one can say for sure, but the point is that it happened. People are catching baseballs with beers, and they're catching them with popcorn buckets. They're catching them bare-handed, and they catching them backhanded. They're catching them and dancing and they're catching them and prancing. And you know what? That's all fine and good. Catch your foul balls with whatever receptacle you want. After all, this is America. Nothing wrong with a little show-boating. But there’s one new aspect of this trend that has been creeping up on us for some time that we need to talk about, if only because's it's gained some recent steam. We’re talking about grabbing foul balls while holding babies, people.    These aren't the only examples we could find, either. There are so, so, so many of them. One baby catch? Fine. Two? Sure. Three? Now we all see what's going on.We get where you’re coming from, moms and dads. You’re cool parents with senses of coordination we can’t match. You love your child, but you also love the spotlight, and this is one of the few instances in which those two passions can be combined into a moment of you being you. Hell, if ""we"" were parents, ""we'd"" probably be right there next to you. Looks pretty fun to be honest. But we aren't parents. We are without child. And that makes us the voice of reason in this particular situation.So quite literally, we beg of you: Think of the children. It’s only a matter of time before an attempt at virality ends with a trip to the hospital and a national conversation about parenting. And as we all know, there is nothing worse than a national conversation about parenting. Don't make it come to that. "

(AP) — Searchers on the trail of two murderers who escaped from a northern New York prison three weeks ago edged closer to the Canadian border Friday after they found new evidence left behind by the pair.Hundreds of officers looking for Richard Matt and David Sweat shifted the focus of their search slightly northwest to woods and fields around Malone, about 30 miles west of Clinton Correctional Facility.State Police Maj. Charles Guess said Friday the shift came after investigators developed evidence left behind by the escapees. Items were found Thursday at a cabin and Friday morning in a field, both in the town of Malone, he said.While Guess would not elaborate on the evidence, he made it sound like a break in the often-frustrating 21-day, around-the-clock search for the two killers.""They probably have every reason to keep going,"" Guess said.

""I know it's taken a long time, but there's a lot of freaking land to cover. The border's pretty tight.""Sweat and Matt broke out of the prison June 6. Authorities say they cut through the steel wall at the back of their cells, scaled down a catwalk, broke through a brick wall, cut their way into and out of a steam pipe and then emerged from a manhole outside the prison.Sweat, 35, was serving a life sentence without parole in the killing of a sheriff's deputy. Matt, who turned 49 on Thursday, was doing 25 years to life in the kidnapping, torture and hacksaw dismemberment of his former boss.Meanwhile, New York state prison officials said Friday that a corrections officer facing charges related to the escape has been suspended without pay.Gene Palmer's suspension from his $72,644-a-year job comes after he was arrested Wednesday night on charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with evidence and official misconduct.Palmer has told investigators he provided paint, tools and prison catwalk access to Matt and Sweat. But the veteran guard says he had no idea they were planning to escape.He is free on $25,000 bail.Another prison worker, tailor shop instructor Joyce Mitchell, is charged with helping them escape. Authorities say Mitchell smuggled hacksaw blades, a screwdriver and other tools into the prison by hiding them in frozen meat that Palmer delivered to the inmates.Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
