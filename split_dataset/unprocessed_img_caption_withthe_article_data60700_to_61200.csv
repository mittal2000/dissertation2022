Two strikes hit the outskirts of Deir al-Asafir and at least seven hit the village of Bala, just north of Deir al-Asafir, the Observatory said.The U.S. State Department said it was appalled by the reported air strikes. ""We condemn in the strongest terms any such attacks directed at civilians,"" spokesman John Kirby said.France condemned the attack on Friday and said it violated the truce. ""This abject act is designed to terrorize the Syrian people and sap efforts by the international community to find a political solution,"" French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said.Parts of the Eastern Ghouta region east of Damascus, where Deir al-Asafir is situated, have been outside President Bashar al-Assad's control almost since the start of the uprising which erupted five years ago and descended into civil war.The area is controlled by different factions, including rebel forces covered by the truce, such as Jaish al-Islam, as well as Nusra Front.The Observatory said 12 children, nine women, a teacher and an emergency response worker were among the 33 dead in Deir al-Asafir.The ""White Helmet"" volunteer rescue organization said emergency worker Walid Ghourani was killed when one of its ambulances was hit. It put the death toll at 32.It released video footage of an ambulance arriving at Deir al-Asafir and a white-helmeted rescue worker, carrying a stretcher over his shoulder, rushing through a rubble-strewn alleyway towards what appeared to be the site of an explosion.It also published pictures it said showed the destruction of the White Helmet base in Deir al-Asafir, including a fuel depot. Fire hoses and gas canisters could be seen among the mounds of collapsed concrete.The Observatory said Syrian government forces have been trying to surround Deir al-Asafir, which it said is still home to 2,700 families.

3,POLITICS,Family Seeks Justice At Human Rights Panel For Man Who Died After Border Patrol Altercation,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anastasio-hernandez-rojas-death-complaint_us_56fd4893e4b0daf53aeef92d,They want border patrol agents held accountable.,2016-03-31,Bernardo Hernández Rojas delivers a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on the death of his brother Anastasio after being apprehended by border agents.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fd493a1e00008700705e2a.jpeg?cache=3Pa2etydUd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Bernardo Hernández Rojas' brother, Anastasio, died in 2010 after border patrol agents used a Taser on him and struck him with a baton repeatedly as he cried out for help -- caught on tape by witnesses -- and took him into custody for crossing the border illegally from Mexico.His family's efforts to get justice for his death have been unsuccessful. Their civil suit has been pending for years and in November, the Department of Justice closed its investigation without pursuing federal charges against any of the agents involved. Now, Rojas and his family are going to the Organization of American States' body that investigates violations of human rights in the western hemisphere, in hopes that the regional organization will do what they feel the U.S. government didn't: deliver justice for Anastasio. The family filed a complaint on Wednesday, against the U.S., with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is part of the OAS, arguing the United States had violated Anastasio Hernández Rojas' human rights, failed to adequately investigate his death and discriminated against undocumented immigrants through ineffective policies to prevent excessive use of force. ""I can't even call it the Department of Justice, it's the department of injustice. They did not dispense justice,"" Bernardo Hernández Rojas told reporters in Spanish. He was joined at a press conference by representatives of the International Human Rights Law Clinic at University of California, Berkeley's School of Law and the advocacy group Alliance San Diego, who submitted the petition on the family's behalf.They hope to not only get a response to Anastasio Hernández Rojas' death, but also a call by the commission that the U.S. improve how it prevents, investigates and disciplines use of force incidents by border agents. ""Part of this effort is to expose for the first time the very serious problems in the criminal investigation,"" Roxanna Altholz of International Human Rights Law Clinic told reporters. ""Not just the excessive use of force that ended Anastasio's life, and not just the allegations of torture, but also the problems with the way these cases are investigated.""Southern Border Communities Coalition, of which Alliance San Diego is a part, tracked more than 46 deaths since 2010 that border agents were involved in, nearly all of which resulted in no discipline, at least announced publicly, for the officers. A panel that examined Customs and Border Protection practices found in a report released this month that although it had made strides toward minimizing use of force, it could do more, such as improving the disciplinary process and better tracking officers who frequently use force. In 2010, border agents apprehended Anastasio Hernández Rojas, a Mexican national and father of five, after he crossed the border without authorization to reunite with his family in San Diego. Customs and Border Protection officials said then that use of force was necessary because he ""became combative"" as they tried to deport him and officers needed to subdue him to maintain their safety. He had a heart attack after his physical encounter with border patrol agents and died two days later after being taken off life support.The Justice Department announced last year that prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to make charges that agents had willfully deprived Hernández Rojas of a constitutional right, violated a federal manslaughter statute, or they ""deployed the taser or restrained Hernandez-Rojas with malice."" Even the Justice Department statement tied the use of force to Hernández Rojas' death, although it did not lay the blame on officers. It stated that according to autopsies, he died of a heart attack and that ""the level of physical exertion during the struggle, the electro-shocks from the taser and positional restraint were stated as contributory factors,"" along with pre-existing heart disease and acute methamphetamine intoxication. It added that a medical examiner said he ""would not have died had there not been methamphetamine intoxication."" That's one of the many problems with the investigation, the complainants argued in their petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. They argue the prosecutors ""used that opportunity to disparage Anastasio’s character"" to allege drug use without clear evidence, and said that there may have been issues with the blood test or other reasons for its result, such as legal mild pain medication.They allege other problems as well, such as the mishandling of evidence and a failure to investigate border agents for destroying evidence and telling witnesses to clear the scene.Andrea Guerrero, director of Alliance San Diego, said one concrete step they would like to see implemented is a requirement that border patrol agents wear body cameras, which they said would have ensured the agents involved in Anastasio Hernández Rojas' death would be behind bars. Customs and Border Protection spokespersons referred questions to the Department of Justice, which did not respond to a request for comment.There were fewer use of force incidents last fiscal year than in the previous one, according to Customs and Border Protection. The agency reported 768 use of force incidents for the 2015 fiscal year, down from 1,037 instances of use of force in the 2014 fiscal year.Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske issued a statement in October saying the agency had made changes to use of force transparency and accountability in the past year, such as ""revamping our training, standing up a new review process, and expediting the disclosure of basic incident information to the public."" ""I am encouraged by the progress and dedication that CBP officers and agents have shown this year,"" he said in that statement. ""However, there is always more that can be done, and we remain committed to strengthening our agency."""
4,IMPACT,Proposed Pot Tax Would Fund Housing For Homeless People In LA,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pot-tax-could-fund-housing-for-homeless-in-la_us_56fd376fe4b0daf53aeee577,It could bring in $16.7 million annually.,2016-03-31,"Green Doctors, writing authorizations for medical marijuana, Venice Beach, CA, July 3, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fd670f2e00002c00950246.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Eager to find a way out of its current homelessness crisis, Los Angeles may look to a potential pot tax to help fund new housing projects.Due to an increase in the number of homeless people and a lack of resources, LA Mayor Eric Garcetti and city council members declared a homelessness state of emergency back in September. In an effort to raise the estimated $2 billion needed for housing vouchers and units, the city proposed a number of measures, which includes a tax on medical marijuana, according to a report released earlier this month.LA is taking a cue from a number of other California cities.It would pass up to a 15 percent tax on pot sales and cultivation, which is estimated to bring in $16.7 million annually. And if pot is legalized for recreational use, the levy would bring in “significantly more” funds, the report noted.The city proposed introducing the pot tax because it’s a new product that could bring in ample revenue. It likened the tax to that which is levied on specific products, such as gasoline and tobacco.The money generated would be used for permanent supportive housing, and supportive services, such as mobile showers, vouchers and outreach.Both Riverside County cities successfully passed a tax on medical marijuana sales and cultivation, and Cathedral City voted to enact a 15 cent per dollar sales tax on medical marijuana.The proposal comes at a time when homelessness is steadily rising.From 2013 to 2015, the number of homeless people in LA County jumped 12 percent to 44,359 people, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. Although the tax would have a benevolent purpose, experts say it could see opposition from consumers.High Times, a pot industry magazine, noted that it would unduly punish patients in need.“Medical marijuana patients rabidly oppose taxation schemes on cannabis because they believe it creates an unfair burden on their choice to use a natural substance rather than prescription drugs,” Mike Adams noted in the piece. “Pot advocates argue that taxing green medicine creates economic hardships for patients and often drives them back into the black market.”The marijuana tax was one of nine suggestions put forth in the report.They represented new funding sources, ones the city may have considered in the past, but required more research and options that could provide long-term support.Among those suggested was an inclusionary zoning ordinance, which would require developers to include affordable housing in their projects or pay a fee. And a tax assessed on billboards and supergraphics could bring in about $24 million annually.Some advocates were reluctant to overtly praise the report, indicating that the city could do more to identify funding sources.Gary Blasi, a homeless advocate and retired professor at the UCLA School of Law, told the LA Times that the report is a “a tiny step in the direction of finding out where the money might be.”"

When they showed up, everyone was at a loss for words.“I don’t think she expected us to come,” the men said of the new mom.But not only did they show up, they were true to their word about not coming empty handed. They stopped by the Dollar General store on the way there and loaded up on goodies.“We got baby diapers, Pampers and a pacifier,” they told Kimmel. The gifts were then delivered in a bag labelled""Precious cargo.""Clearly blown away, Kimmel remarked: ""You should be the Godparents.""That suggestion sent both brothers rolling backwards with excitement.“That’s what I wanted!” one of them exclaimed.Kimmel, of course, had to ask: “Is this the first time you’ve ever dropped in on strangers to meet their baby?”“Yeah, most definitely,” they both assured him with a laugh.In a hilarious twist, the brothers said they never actually got to meet the baby.

The researchers compared children's sleep quality as reported by their parents with objective sleep quality measures recorded by a sleep-tracking device. The data revealed a discrepancy in the reports that came from parents who suffer their own sleep woes. The parents' poor sleep habits were to blame for more than a third of the difference between the kids' parent-reported sleep quality and the actual measured quality of the kids' sleep.The researchers asked the parents of 100 children between the ages of 2 and 6 to complete two questionnaires at the start of the study — one to report the quality of their child’s sleep, and one to report their own sleep. Then, they were given ""actigraphs"" — wristwatch-like bands that measure the amount of movement acceleration in time to track sleep — for their children to wear for one week.The actigraphs tracked measures including a child’s resistance to falling asleep, the time spent sleeping compared with the total time spent in the bed, and the amount of physically active time during the whole sleep phase, so they provide a good measure of restlessness during sleep, the study authors noted. The researchers found that although parents who reported having trouble sleeping were more likely to report sleep problems in their children, sleep quality was actually not any poorer for those kids as determined by the trackers. Many studies in kids rely on secondhand data reported by parents, the researchers note. It's important for future studies to take into account that parents may not be the most reliable source for measuring (and diagnosing!) sleep trouble in their kids, study author Marko Elovainio, a professor of psychology at the University of Helsinki, told The Huffington Post.“Objective measures should be used, too,” he said.The findings are noteworthy for anyone treating sleep problems in kids, or anyone seeking treatment for their kids, Elovainio said.""Tired parents can unconsciously exaggerate their children's sleep difficulties, which could lead to misplaced interventions,"" the study authors explain. These findings suggest it would be helpful to ask parents how they are sleeping themselves, too, when it comes to treating kids' slumber troubles.Sarah DiGiulio is The Huffington Post's sleep reporter.

But a new survey from Pew Research highlights what could be an even more crucial divide: how voters feel about the trajectory of their own lives.""The 2016 presidential campaign has exposed deep disagreements between -- and within -- the two parties on a range of major policy issues,"" the report's authors write. ""But these divisions go well beyond the issues and extend to fundamentally different visions of the way that life in the United States has changed.""Supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton actually agree on a few economic points. Both groups are staunchly against reducing social security benefits, and believe that the economic system favors powerful interests.They differ most notably, though, on whether life is improving or getting worse for people like them.There's a significant gap just between the two parties, with Republicans 38 points more likely than Democrats to say things are getting worse. But the gulf is even wider between Trump supporters, who are the most pessimistic, and Clinton supporters, who are the most personally optimistic. Not coincidentally, disaffection with society's direction is most pronounced among the demographic groups where Trump holds the most appeal. A 54 percent majority of white voters believe life is getting worse for people like them, as do 60 percent of whites who haven't completed college.In contrast, black voters, who have formed the base of Clinton's support in many primaries, have the sunniest outlook of any demographic group, with 58 percent saying that things have improved.Pretty much every election year gives the incumbent party incentive to argue that things have improved under their watch, while the challengers issue a rallying cry for change.This year, though, with a showdown likely between a never-been-elected businessman pledging to fundamentally reshape America and a former cabinet member who has hewed closely to President Barack Obama's legacy, the difference is exceptionally stark. That makes it a troubling sign for Democrats that overall, by a 12-point margin, voters view life as getting worse, and that less than a third believe the economy is excellent or good.But the survey offers some better news for them, too. Obama's job approval, which was largely underwater during his second term, seems to be on a significant rebound, with most Americans rating him positively for the first time since 2013.Pew surveyed 2,254 adults between March 17-27, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones.---Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
10,POLITICS,It's Not Just Police Shooting Scandals: Why Prosecutors Across The Country Are Finally Losing Elections,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prosecutors-losing-elections_us_56f03af3e4b084c67220ffa3,"""Tough on crime"" was once a winning strategy. Now it's becoming a liability.",2016-03-31,Demonstrators march at Chicago's City Hall to protest the police shooting of Laquan McDonald and call for the removal of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fd3b1f1e0000b300705dd1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"District attorney seats have been among the safest in local elections.During Chicago's most recent Election Day, voters made it clear to the top prosecutor of the nation's second-largest county that it was time to start packing. Anita Alvarez, the state's attorney for Cook County who had waited more than a year to indict the officer who shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, lost her bid for re-election that night -- badly. In Ohio, so did Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty, who had declined to indict the cop who shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice.Criminal justice reform groups hailed the unseating of two prosecutors who had bungled major police shooting cases as an important win. ""This could be a sea change and might mean that prosecutors might become more accountable to the public,"" Daniel Medwed, a Northeastern University law professor specializing in criminal law, said via email. ""This is largely attributable to Black Lives Matter and the attention paid to prosecutorial decisions about how to proceed.""Alvarez and McGinty's defeats were certainly notable. On average, incumbent prosecutors win re-election 95 percent of the time (in districts with more than 100,000 voters, like Cook and Cuyahoga counties, the rate dips to 90 percent). They win re-election slightly more often than state lawmakers, according to a study from Ohio State University's law school. Between 55 and 80 percent of the time, prosecutors run for re-election unopposed.Yet while reform groups targeted both Alvarez and McGinty because of high-profile national scandals, this only partially explains why the two prosecutors lost.In fact, some experts now say that a string of incumbent defeats across the country suggests it doesn't take a Black Lives Matter-specific flashpoint for voters to reject incumbent prosecutors. For many DAs, their longstanding embrace of tough-on-crime policies is reason enough.""DAs almost never lose elections,"" said John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham University's law school. ""And now they’re starting to.""While Pfaff says McGinty's ouster was ""entirely a rejection for his failure to prosecute Tamir Rice's shooter,"" Alvarez had a history of advancing harsh and seemingly vindictive policies during her tenure. But Pfaff cites the defeats of two prosecutors in the deep South as even more revealing examples of how voters are beginning to reject a decades-old approach to crime along with the incumbents themselves.In November, Mississippi voters sacked District Attorney Forrest Allgood after 27 years in office. The Washington Post described Allgood as ""one of America's worst prosecutors"" due to his aggressive prosecutions against vulnerable defendants, including a 13-year-old boy and an intellectually disabled young woman. Both convictions were overturned. ""Allgood lost to someone smarter on crime, less tough on crime,"" Pfaff said. ""That's a much more promising trend.""In Louisiana's Caddo Parish, which includes Shreveport, acting District Attorney Dale Cox faced such long odds that he pulled out of the race before the November election. Cox, who was in and out of the district attorney's office for thirty years, established a shockingly high record of capital murder convictions: Caddo Parish is home to roughly five percent of the state's population, but accounts for a third of the state's death sentences -- several of which have been overturned. That's a sign of a major shift in public sentiment. In the 1980s and 1990s, when crime rates were significantly higher than they are today, prosecutors embraced policies like ""three strikes"" laws and mandatory minimum sentences. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush's thumping of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election stood for years as a clear signal to elected officials that being tough on crime was a key to victory. During a 1996 speech on crime at New Hampshire’s Keene State College, then-first lady Hillary Clinton infamously invoked the term ""super predator,"" a junk science term that predicted a wave of fearless, brutal, amoral juveniles who would kill, rape or steal without remorse.As crime rates have declined, however, prosecutors have been slow to adjust to the new reality. ""They retained those policies even as crime was falling, which makes it hard to justify those policies now,"" Pfaff said. Accusing your opponent of being ""soft on crime"" ""no longer seems to be the dependable political cudgel it once was,"" reported the online journalism nonprofit The Marshall Project last year. Rob Smith, a senior fellow at Harvard Law School’s Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice, also notes that local prosecutors have become more visible thanks to increased media coverage of incidents like the Laquan McDonald shooting. Consequently, the public is becoming more aware of the unilateral decision-making power they wield.""Prosecutors have a lot discretion over what crimes they charge,"" Smith said. ""There’s a saying that a jury can indict a ham sandwich. But if you can indict a ham sandwich, why can’t you indict a cop who killed a kid?"" That doesn't mean putting lots of people in prison has fallen completely out of favor, Pfaff noted. County prosecutors may still find support for such tactics in the suburban parts of their district. ""Suburbs feel the benefits of the city being safer,"" he said. ""They feel the risk of drugs coming into their neighborhood being kept at bay, they feel safer when they commute to work in the city … but they don’t feel the costs of that enforcement."" The result, Pfaff said, is that ""we sort of allow the suburbs to have a say in how policing affects the city.""Mariame Kaba, who has backed an array of racial justice, anti-criminalization and anti-violence organizations in Chicago for nearly three decades, cites Cook County as a prime example of suburban voters' influence on urban policy.""You see this divide over city and suburbs: Suburbs love 'tough on crime' because it doesn’t affect them,"" she says. ""To them, it’s black and brown people who are running wild and need a firm hand to tamp them down.""Suburban voters will continue to have disproportionate power in prosecutor elections, Pfaff said. But, he added, the Black Lives Matter movement has proved to be a powerful entry point for increasing support for various criminal justice reform issues. Many more district attorneys who have prosecuted aggressively and punitively will be replaced in the next five years, Smith predicts.""I think you’re going to see a lot more progressive candidates running for office, you're going to a see a lot of places with more contested elections, and see more places where an incumbent prosecutor is ousted,"" he said. Pfaff believes that even in places like Maricopa County, Arizona, or Harris County, Texas -- both notorious for their tough-on-crime approach -- more-engaged voters could soon rein in aggressive prosecutors. ""We could be on the precipice of one of the most important changes in history about how the state and individuals interact with each other,"" Pfaff said. Just four weeks ago, voters in Corpus Christi, Texas, voted out Mark Skurka, the county district attorney. Skurka and his office had been accused of misconduct, which Pfaff said ""appalled"" voters and local journalists alike. ""A tattooed defense lawyer ran against him in the primary and won,"" Pfaff said. ""I think that’s powerful."""
11,POLITICS,It's Not Just Police Shooting Scandals: Why Prosecutors Across The Country Are Finally Losing Elections,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prosecutors-losing-elections_us_56f03af3e4b084c67220ffa3,"""Tough on crime"" was once a winning strategy. Now it's becoming a liability.",2016-03-31,Protesters at a rally in Chicago calling for the removal of Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f465791e000095007114d4.jpeg?cache=PUGYX9zwRk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"District attorney seats have been among the safest in local elections.During Chicago's most recent Election Day, voters made it clear to the top prosecutor of the nation's second-largest county that it was time to start packing. Anita Alvarez, the state's attorney for Cook County who had waited more than a year to indict the officer who shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, lost her bid for re-election that night -- badly. In Ohio, so did Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty, who had declined to indict the cop who shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice.Criminal justice reform groups hailed the unseating of two prosecutors who had bungled major police shooting cases as an important win. ""This could be a sea change and might mean that prosecutors might become more accountable to the public,"" Daniel Medwed, a Northeastern University law professor specializing in criminal law, said via email. ""This is largely attributable to Black Lives Matter and the attention paid to prosecutorial decisions about how to proceed.""Alvarez and McGinty's defeats were certainly notable. On average, incumbent prosecutors win re-election 95 percent of the time (in districts with more than 100,000 voters, like Cook and Cuyahoga counties, the rate dips to 90 percent). They win re-election slightly more often than state lawmakers, according to a study from Ohio State University's law school. Between 55 and 80 percent of the time, prosecutors run for re-election unopposed.Yet while reform groups targeted both Alvarez and McGinty because of high-profile national scandals, this only partially explains why the two prosecutors lost.In fact, some experts now say that a string of incumbent defeats across the country suggests it doesn't take a Black Lives Matter-specific flashpoint for voters to reject incumbent prosecutors. For many DAs, their longstanding embrace of tough-on-crime policies is reason enough.""DAs almost never lose elections,"" said John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham University's law school. ""And now they’re starting to.""While Pfaff says McGinty's ouster was ""entirely a rejection for his failure to prosecute Tamir Rice's shooter,"" Alvarez had a history of advancing harsh and seemingly vindictive policies during her tenure. But Pfaff cites the defeats of two prosecutors in the deep South as even more revealing examples of how voters are beginning to reject a decades-old approach to crime along with the incumbents themselves.In November, Mississippi voters sacked District Attorney Forrest Allgood after 27 years in office. The Washington Post described Allgood as ""one of America's worst prosecutors"" due to his aggressive prosecutions against vulnerable defendants, including a 13-year-old boy and an intellectually disabled young woman. Both convictions were overturned. ""Allgood lost to someone smarter on crime, less tough on crime,"" Pfaff said. ""That's a much more promising trend.""In Louisiana's Caddo Parish, which includes Shreveport, acting District Attorney Dale Cox faced such long odds that he pulled out of the race before the November election. Cox, who was in and out of the district attorney's office for thirty years, established a shockingly high record of capital murder convictions: Caddo Parish is home to roughly five percent of the state's population, but accounts for a third of the state's death sentences -- several of which have been overturned. That's a sign of a major shift in public sentiment. In the 1980s and 1990s, when crime rates were significantly higher than they are today, prosecutors embraced policies like ""three strikes"" laws and mandatory minimum sentences. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush's thumping of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election stood for years as a clear signal to elected officials that being tough on crime was a key to victory. During a 1996 speech on crime at New Hampshire’s Keene State College, then-first lady Hillary Clinton infamously invoked the term ""super predator,"" a junk science term that predicted a wave of fearless, brutal, amoral juveniles who would kill, rape or steal without remorse.As crime rates have declined, however, prosecutors have been slow to adjust to the new reality. ""They retained those policies even as crime was falling, which makes it hard to justify those policies now,"" Pfaff said. Accusing your opponent of being ""soft on crime"" ""no longer seems to be the dependable political cudgel it once was,"" reported the online journalism nonprofit The Marshall Project last year. Rob Smith, a senior fellow at Harvard Law School’s Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice, also notes that local prosecutors have become more visible thanks to increased media coverage of incidents like the Laquan McDonald shooting. Consequently, the public is becoming more aware of the unilateral decision-making power they wield.""Prosecutors have a lot discretion over what crimes they charge,"" Smith said. ""There’s a saying that a jury can indict a ham sandwich. But if you can indict a ham sandwich, why can’t you indict a cop who killed a kid?"" That doesn't mean putting lots of people in prison has fallen completely out of favor, Pfaff noted. County prosecutors may still find support for such tactics in the suburban parts of their district. ""Suburbs feel the benefits of the city being safer,"" he said. ""They feel the risk of drugs coming into their neighborhood being kept at bay, they feel safer when they commute to work in the city … but they don’t feel the costs of that enforcement.""

The job at the FOP pays him $12 an hour, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.“We do this for our membership and this is what the FOP stands for, fraternalism. This officer is in a very difficult situation, financially, he has a family and we would do it for anybody that works as a Chicago police officer,” Dean Angelo Sr., president of the Chicago FOP, told Chicago's Fox 32 news channel.The union has “probably” either directly employed or found jobs for 100 officers deprived of their pay for an infraction, Angelo told the Sun-Times.Chicago activists fighting to end perceived impunity for police officers who kill unarmed black men immediately responded to Van Dyke’s hiring with anger and disbelief.Protesters called for Angelo's resignation as FOP president and the immediate firing of Van Dyke. At a press conference Thursday, they broke into a chant by megaphone: ""Who's gotta go? Dean Angelo!"" “We’re reaching out to organizations and people expressing outrage over his hiring to give voice to the citizens who feel affected by this,” Brown said.Father Michael Pfleger, a longtime community activist and pastor of St. Sabina church on the city’s South Side, also said Angelo should resign. He called Van Dyke’s hiring a “disgrace.”“This is an insult. It’s arrogant. It’s the reason we have broken relationships between police now and the community,” Pfleger said. “You take this horrific case that turned the city upside down and now you take us back to ground zero again.”The Catholic priest said that the police union could have found Van Dyke a job elsewhere if it wanted to help him.“If I hired someone at the church here who was indicted for killing a cop, they’d have ate me up,” Pfleger added. He said he was not sure if he would be able to attend the protest, however.News of Van Dyke’s comes as Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) seeks to restore trust in the city’s police force and improve his political standing in the process. Emanuel appointed Eddie Johnson as the city’s interim police chief on Sunday, rejecting the candidates recommended by the city’s police board. Appointing Johnson, an African-American veteran of the Chicago police force, as interim chief makes it easier for the mayor to keep him in the top job permanently, should he choose to do so.Pfleger said he has spoken to Johnson several times and believes he understands the need to rebuild relations between police and the community. But the police union's hiring of Van Dyke “kicks the new police chief in the face,” Pfleger said. Brown called the Van Dyke controversy Johnson’s “first major test.”“I am pressuring him to speak to the citizens about their concerns that Van Dyke is being hired even though he shot the young man 16 times,” Brown said. “He has to speak to the heartbeat of it. He will either validate or invalidate further his appointment with what he does in this situation.” The Chicago Police Department declined to comment, referring requests to the FOP. Angelo did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

Larry Hogan (R) as his director of intergovernmental affairs. Her last day is set to be Friday, and she is the second black top staffer to depart the RNC this month.Quarker-Hartsfield joins several other staffers of color who have departed the RNC recently. Orlando Watson, communications director for black media, left earlier this month. Tara Wall and Raffi Williams, son of Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, both left their press positions at the RNC late last year. RNC Chair Reince Priebus has said that expanding the party and reaching out to groups of people who don't usually vote Republican are priorities. After the 2012 elections, he famously released an autopsy report concluding that the GOP needed to broaden its base if it wanted to survive a changing country. ""The RNC cannot and will not write off any demographic or community or region of this country,"" Priebus said at the time.But the GOP's presidential front-runner, Donald Trump, threatens to upend much of that work with his incendiary comments about women, immigrants, protesters and Muslims that appall many members of his own party.Asked about her decision to depart, Quarker-Hartsfield told HuffPost, ""I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the RNC. It has been an honor to work for Chairman Priebus during an exciting time in politics. It has been exciting to have a front row seat to a national Republican movement to maintain the House and win back the Senate. Chairman Priebus is an innovative leader who empowers his team, and serves my Party as a humble servant leader.""Williams denied that he left the RNC because of Trump.""I left because I was just ready for something new.

The tide began to shift last week, after Trump threatened to ""spill the beans"" on Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, and later retweeted a meme comparing Heidi Cruz's appearance to his wife, Melania, who is a former model. Then, in a Monday interview, Trump claimed his repeated disparaging comments about women -- often about their appearance -- were jokes. The next day, Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was charged with allegedly assaulting reporter Michelle Fields, prompting Trump to engage in some textbook victim-blaming. And on Wednesday, he floated ""punishment"" for women who have abortions. (He quickly backtracked on the remarks, suggesting doctors should be punished instead.) It's become too much for some of Trump's staunchest allies. Stephanie Cegielski, a former spokeswoman for a pro-Trump super PAC, published a scathing essay this week on xoJane, explaining why she had soured on the candidate. According to Cegielski, who worked for the Make America Great Again PAC, Trump's candidacy was intended as a political protest, but spun out of hand as his infamous ego got in the way. ""He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver's seat, and nothing else matters,"" Cegielski wrote. ""The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy."" Ultra-conservative pundit Ann Coulter, meanwhile, has gone out of her way to defend Trump countless times. But it appears even her support has its limits. Appearing on a podcast hosted by Breitbart's Milo Yiannopoulos, Coulter said Trump had crossed the line with his tweets about Heidi Cruz. ""Our candidate is mental,"" Coulter said. ""Do you realize our candidate is mental? It's like constantly having to bail out your sixteen-year-old son from prison."" (However, as she wrote in a column Wednesday, Coulter still believes Trump is the GOP's only hope for securing the White House.) Newt Gingrich, who previously praised the business mogul as an ""ally to conservatism,"" also criticized Trump for going after Cruz's wife, calling the Twitter spat ""utterly stupid"" and a ""wake-up call"" for the candidate.""It has frankly weakened everything that Trump ought to be strengthening,"" Gingrich told Fox News' Sean Hannity. ""It sent a signal to women that is negative at a time when his numbers with the women are already bad. It sent a signal of instability to people who are beginning to say, 'OK, maybe I've gotta get used to it, maybe I've gotta rely on him, maybe he could be presidential.'""Former WWE CEO Linda McMahon, a longtime friend and business partner of Trump's, lambasted his campaign's sexist rhetoric in an interview with Katie Couric.“He’s not helping, certainly, to put women in the best light,"" she said. ""Maybe he regrets [his remarks], maybe he doesn’t. I realize he punches hard when he punches back, but that’s just over the top. I wish that no candidate would make those comments.""And after his abortion remarks Wednesday, Trump even earned ire from some anti-abortion groups.""No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion,"" said March for Life executive Jeanne Mancini. ""This is against the very nature of what we are about. We invite a woman who has gone down this route to consider paths to healing, not punishment.”Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser said ""punishment is solely for the abortionist who profits"" from performing the procedure.""We have never advocated, in any context, for the punishment of women who undergo abortion,"" she added. As HuffPost Pollster noted Wednesday, his support could be waning elsewhere: Trump's net favorables are down by 14 percent over the last two months.Meanwhile, other conservatives, who are not Trump fans, are also speaking out against him. A group of 16 female reporters, many from conservative media outlets, called on the candidate to fire Lewandowski for his ""inexcusable"" behavior.And in a National Review column about Coulter, Gingrich and Cegielski, Jim Geraghty berated his fellow conservatives for just now turning on Trump.""He didn’t abruptly become reckless, obnoxious, ill-informed, erratic, hot-tempered, pathologically dishonest, narcissistic, crude and catastrophically unqualified for the presidency overnight,"" he wrote. ""He’s always been that guy, and you denied it and ignored it and hand-waved it away and made excuses every step of the way because you were convinced that you were so much smarter than the rest of us.""

16,POLITICS,Donald Trump Wants To Remind White People That Gun Violence Is A Black Problem,Dana Liebelson and Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-gun-violence-black-problem_us_56fd7a72e4b0a06d58053e40,Inside Trump's plan to combat gun violence: the decades-old Project Exile.,2016-03-31,"GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a town hall event in Appleton, Wisconsin, on March 30, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fd7b231500002a000b3c19.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Nailing down specifics about Donald Trump’s policies is exhausting. He makes things up, changes his mind and neglects details. One of the six issues he's actually fleshed out on his campaign website concerns gun rights, where he says he will combat gun violence by bringing back measures like Project Exile, a 1990s-era state-federal partnership.Trump doesn’t seem to realize that Project Exile never really ended -- it still exists, and parts of it have expanded nationwide. His proposal doesn't really make sense, but it does serve his purposes: It focuses on cities, where his overwhelmingly white base doesn't live. It locks up ""drug dealers and gang members,"" not ""law-abiding gun-owners."" It doesn't address other routine forms of gun violence, like shootings by toddlers, family members, domestic abusers, countless legal gun owners, or mass shooters such as Dylann Roof and Elliot Rodger. And for people like Trump, it also makes a great racist dog-whistle. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) ""Violent crime in cities like Baltimore, Chicago and many others is out of control,"" Trump warns in his online pitch for resurrecting the still-extant program, citing two of the American cities with the highest number of black residents. ""Drug dealers and gang members are given a slap on the wrist and turned loose on the street.""Trump's strategy is pretty transparent, said Ladd Everitt, a spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ""By framing America’s gun violence problem as a black problem concentrated entirely in urban areas,"" he said, Trump and groups like the NRA ""can get policymakers to ignore a huge percentage of the gun deaths happening in their communities."" Project Exile, part of a national wave of tough-on-crime measures, was launched by the U.S. Attorney's office in Richmond, Virginia and other agencies to reduce violent crime by cracking down on illegal gun possession. Shootings and homicides had spiked in Richmond throughout the late '80s and early '90s. The city was heavily armed, and many of those guns were being used in crimes.The program created a partnership between state and federal law enforcement that pushed for certain firearms cases to be prosecuted in federal court, where defendants faced harsher prison sentences. The possibility of getting locked up without bail or the possibility of parole and being shipped to a federal prison far from home -- or ""exiled"" -- was supposed to convince people to put down their weapons. The initiative included a public information campaign warning Richmonders that “an illegal gun will get you five years in federal prison.”Concerns about racial disparities plagued the program. In 1999, the American Civil Liberties Union argued against a proposal to recreate Project Exile in every U.S. attorney’s office across the country. The ACLU noted the initiative had come under fire for clogging federal courts, and that federal prosecutors used Project Exile to skew the jury pool and keep African-Americans from serving on juries. (A federal jury pool would likely be much whiter than one drawn from the Richmond area, for example.) It also targeted communities of color and encouraged people to turn in their neighbors, the group said.“Based on the way those programs are implemented ... you are going to have a significantly higher number of minorities, specifically black and African-American minorities, negatively impacted,"" said Robyn McDougle, an associate professor of criminal justice at Virginia Commonwealth University. But those communities were also more likely to be victimized by violent crime, she added, so focusing resources there made sense.Before Project Exile, Richmond had failed to limit or deter violent crime because criminals thought they wouldn't face serious jail time, McDougle said. ""They used to joke about it and they used to call it their vacation,"" she said.In about the first year of the program, authorities seized 440 firearms and indicted 372 people for federal gun violations. And crime went down: In 1997, when the program started, Richmond police counted 139 homicides, enough to make the city the murder capital of the U.S. Two years later, the number of annual homicides fell to 72. Supporters celebrated Project Exile's success. “Drug dealers, gangs and felons stopped carrying guns,” NRA chief Wayne Lapierre said in 2013, at a congressional hearing where he repeatedly touted the program. The NRA was a big backer of Project Exile in the '90s, and it remains one of the few gun enforcement measures that the group regularly supports.Trump claims the initiative was ""tremendous"" and plans to ""bring back and expand” programs like it. But Project Exile has, in fact, already expanded significantly since it was rolled out in Richmond nearly 20 years ago.""Once it became popular, many people adopted it,"" said David Whaley, a Richmond attorney who has represented defendants in Exile cases. ""You really don't implement it, because it's what the federal law is -- it's just enforcing the federal law.”The core components of Project Exile remain in place in a number of cities. State and federal prosecutors across the country, including in Baltimore and Chicago, are still working together to prosecute firearms-related cases in federal court, where they're able to seek longer sentences. But criminal justice experts are divided on whether the program was fair to minority communities -- or whether it even worked.In 2003, two professors published a study arguing that homicide rates in Richmond would have decreased anyway, because the city had unusually large increases in gun homicides through the mid-1990s, and cities with ""larger-than-average increases in gun homicide rates subsequently experience unusually large declines.""Another study published in 2005 offered a more favorable analysis of Project Exile. Using a longer time frame and controlling for other influences, researchers found Richmond’s firearm homicide rate fell more rapidly after the program was implemented than in other large U.S. cities. The researchers characterized their findings as ""fairly strong circumstantial case for Exile’s impact,"" but couldn't say with certainty that the drop wasn't due to ""unmeasured factors."" David Baugh, a Virginia defense attorney, remains unconvinced. “It was very bad, it was very oppressive, and it was targeting African-Americans,” he said. Baugh says he left his job with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Richmond in 1983 after he questioned why black defendants were being sentenced to more time than white defendants. He told HuffPost that with Project Exile, members of law enforcement were also prone to do more favors for white defendants. “Whenever you have these draconian laws,"" he added, ""They don't apply to everybody.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

He first visited Detroit last year, removed the facade of the house, which was purchased and donated by a local friend, and shipped it overseas. In the Netherlands city, he reconstructed the shell and painted it white.

The post, which has garnered over 390,000 likes and close to 30,000 shares, explained how palm oil plantations are threatening the species' habitat in the Leuser Ecosystem -- an area of forest located in the provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra on the Indonesia island of Sumatra:DiCaprio’s goal is to work alongside local partners to create a “mega-fauna sanctuary” so the endangered species can continue to find enough water and food to survive.According to the World Wildlife Fund, Sumatran elephants shifted from the classification of “endangered” to “critically endangered” in 2012, due to Sumatra experiencing one of the highest rates of deforestation in the Asian elephant range, losing 70 percent of its habitat in just one generation. WWF cites palm oil plantations and pulp and paper industries in Sumatra’s Riau province as reasons for the deforestation.HAkA, a local NGO, that DiCaprio advocates for in his post, also points out in the video below that the Aceh government wants to dismantle national spatial planning laws that currently protect the Leuser Ecosystem, which further threatens the elephant’s survival. Yet DiCaprio -- whose eponymous foundation, recently donated $15 million in grants for environmental projects ­-- sums up the significance of conserving this habitat best in his post by simply pointing out that the Leuser Ecosystem is the “last place on Earth where Sumatran orangutans, tigers, rhinos and elephants coexist in the wild.”And who wants to lose that?"

In the deadliest attack in Kenya in nearly two decades, gunmen stormed the campus of Garissa University at dawn on April 2, 2015, and turned the college dormitories, halls and chapels into a war zone. It later emerged that Kenyan authorities had again ignored intelligence about an impending assault due to a lack of coordination between security agencies.The violence also underscored Kenya’s problem of home-grown radicalization -- the suspects included a university security guard, a former school principal from Garissa and a high-flying law student from the capital of Nairobi.In the year since, some Kenyans fear little has changed. Students worry that their campuses are still not adequately protected. Meanwhile, human rights groups say that Kenya’s heavy-handed crackdown on terror suspects continues to disproportionately affect Muslims and Somalis, alienating the very people they want to keep out of al Shabab’s grasp.But Kenyan teachers and students are stepping in to fill some of the gaps in Kenyan counterterror efforts.The idea for one such initiative was born in Garissa itself, before the attacks. Ayub Mohamud, a 38-year-old high school teacher from the northeastern Kenyan town of Wajir, was teaching in Garissa up until 2013. The town was already plagued by instability, and he became concerned that students who didn’t have strong mentors at home or school were especially vulnerable to indoctrination by al Shabab.“Lack of mentorship … creates a vacuum in the communities and gives extremist recruiters an upper hand to prey on and lure our young people,” he told The WorldPost.Mohamud fought back with education. His Islamic studies classes explored teachings critical of the extremists’ ideology, and encouraged students to ask questions and have dialogues about their views.His experience with students in Garissa inspired him to create a network of teachers trying to stop extremists from recruiting their students. After moving to Nairobi in 2013, Mohamud set up Teachers Against Violent Extremism, which has trained 50 teachers to challenge extremist narratives in the classroom. His work gained international recognition when he became the only African finalist for the Global Teacher Prize earlier this year.“Teachers have a pivotal role to play in tackling radicalization and changing the mindset of their students,” Mohamud told The WorldPost.Mohamud currently works in a tough neighborhood in Nairobi. Eastleigh is often nicknamed ""Little Mogadishu"" because of its large Somali population, which includes refugees fleeing war in Somalia and Kenyans with Somali ethnicity. It's a thriving commercial center, but is also maligned as a hotbed of terror -- often the first place security agencies raid after al Shabab strikes. While militants have carried out attacks in Eastleigh, residents say the whole community is being punished for being Somali and Muslim. Kenyan security forces launched major crackdowns in Eastleigh in 2013 and 2014, rounding up thousands of people and detaining, abusing and deporting some back to Somalia.“It didn’t matter if you had an ID. If you were Somali, you got arrested, and you had to pay someone a bribe so you don’t go to detention,” said Mohamed, a 34-year-old resident of Eastleigh who was born in Somalia. He paid a bribe to avoid jail after he was arrested in 2013. “If you don’t have any money, they look for something to do to you, even branding you a terrorist.""Mohamed declined to give his last name because he fears for his safety. He steers clear of police on the streets and tries to get home before 6 P.M. to avoid being arrested again. ""The situation [in Eastleigh] has caused a lot of people to go back to Somalia, and there are no good incomes back there, so they have to join those guys,"" he told The WorldPost late last year, referring to al Shabab.Somalia-based al Shabab has stepped up attacks in Kenya since Nairobi sent troops over the border in 2011 to drive the extremist group from several of its strongholds. The militants exploit Kenya's religious divisions, corruption and alienated youth to enlist Kenyans of all backgrounds -- rich and poor, Somali and non-Somali, Muslim and non-Muslim. Some estimates suggest one-quarter of al Shabab fighters are from Kenya.The school where Mohamud teaches, a 900-pupil boys’ school called Eastleigh High School, was named a top target for al Shabab recruiters by Kenyan media. Mohamud says that as his students grew to trust him, they told him about losing relatives to al Shabab.“Many of them started sharing ordeals of how close friends, brothers and sisters have disappeared from their homes, and were later reported to have crossed the border” into Somalia, Mohamud said. He wanted to make sure they had alternatives. He founded another organization, the Community Development Initiative, to bring residents together to focus on strategies to counter radicalization. In 2013, after al Shabab militants killed 67 people at the upmarket Westgate shopping mall in the capital, Mohamud’s students and the Community Development Initiative helped organize a peace march through Eastleigh. They wanted to send a clear message: These attacks have nothing to do with religion, and Muslims and Christians are united against terrorism. “When communities unite, extremists feel challenged and defeated,” Mohamud said.Mohamud’s initiative is one of many teacher and student-led efforts to prevent radicalization and help students feel safe on campus after the Garissa attack. Law students in Nairobi set up International Youth Action Against Terrorism last year to get students involved in fighting extremism on campus. Other groups have campaigned for more security guards to protect schools. For the second anniversary of the Garissa massacre on Saturday, students and residents are holding a marathon to remember the victims and demonstrate the community's resilience.But they'll also have to overcome Kenya's patchy and sometimes self-defeating counter-radicalization strategy, experts warn.The Garissa and Westgate attacks were a “wake-up call” for Kenya to intensify its drive against extremism, says the U.S. Institute of Peace’s Muhammad Fraser-Rahim. Yet months after its planned release, the country’s national strategy for fighting violent extremism is still only in draft form. And while the document is expected to emphasize cooperation with community-led initiatives, longstanding distrust between the government and civil society has only gotten worse in recent months. Fraser-Rahim says Kenya has “not even scratched the surface” when it comes to supporting alternative ways to address extremism, like Somali-language comic books, religious dialogue or traditional conflict mechanisms.Meanwhile, police abuses, corruption and the sense that authorities are targeting an entire community end up alienating people and bolstering al Shabab’s outreach, experts say.Mohamud has seen this up close in Eastleigh. “Crackdowns only create hostility and mistrust among the communities and law enforcement agencies,” he said. “The only solution is working together in a more honest and open manner to tackle such challenges.”Abdulatif Salat contributed reporting."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fd51041e00008700705e44.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you thought Florida and Texas were the only states that had to worry about Zika virus this summer, think again. On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its maps showing the territory range for the Zika-capable Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species of mosquito.The agency noted that the Aedes aegypti is more likely to spread viruses such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya than the Aedes albopictus, though the latter is capable of transmission, too. ""There are more places at risk than realize they're at risk, given where the mosquito is likely to be present,"" said CDC director Tom Frieden, according to the Associated Press. Still, the agency's website was careful to note that the maps represent the potential ranges for the mosquitos, not the risk for disease spread.So far, there have been 312 travel-related Zika cases confirmed in the United States, and zero locally acquired cases. Since the virus can also be transmitted sexually, the agency recommends that men who contract Zika virus wait six months before having unprotected sex -- whether vaginal, anal, and oral -- and that pregnant couples with a Zika-infected male partner abstain from sex or use condoms every time. Most people who contract Zika virus develop very mild symptoms, or don't show any signs of having had the virus at all. But doctors and researchers strongly suspect there's a connection between women who contract Zika during pregnancy and the birth defect microcephaly, which can cause babies to be born with abnormally small heads and in some cases, cognitive problems. It may also cause miscarriage and stillbirth, and women who have traveled to an area with Zika virus are advised to wait eight weeks before trying to get pregnant. In Brazil, where Zika virus has been rapidly spreading since last year, there are 944 confirmed cases of microcephaly at latest count."
