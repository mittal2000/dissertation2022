But while Melhem's death marked the end of a weeklong manhunt that had gripped Israel with anxiety, some say the events leading up to it aggravated a growing rift between Israel’s Jewish and Palestinian citizens. The authorities' handling of the incidents may also serve to widen the gap between the conservative Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Obama administration, which has already been critical of Netanyahu's remarks about Israel's Palestinian citizens.Although Israel is widely criticized for its occupation of Palestinian territories conquered in 1967, it often points to the citizenship of Palestinians inside Israel as evidence of its commitment to democracy, particularly relative to neighboring Arab states. But events in the past week could threaten that image.Nashat Melhem, the suspect in the Tel Aviv shooting, was a Palestinian citizen of Israel, unlike most other Palestinian assailants implicated in a wave of attacks against Israelis since October. These Palestinian citizens make up about 20 percent of the country’s population. But while they enjoy the right to vote in parliamentary elections and hold public office, they have long complained that they are second-class citizens and suffer from discriminatory policies.The Israeli government’s response to the deadly shooting in Tel Aviv, as well as the ejection of Palestinian citizens of Israel from an airplane at the behest of Jewish Israelis, reinforced the perception of systemic discrimination against Arabs inside the state.Muhammad Melhem, the suspect’s father, works in security and had tipped authorities off after realizing that one of his guns was missing and recognizing his son’s face in video footage of the shooter. As one analyst pointed out, Melhem's father was more apologetic about his son's alleged crime than the parents of one of the unnamed Jewish Israeli suspects arrested in connection with the July arson murder of the Palestinian West Bank family, the Dawabshehs.That did not stop Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from insinuating that the shooting was reflective of a culture of lawlessness among Israel’s Palestinian communities.""I will not accept two states within Israel,"" Netanyahu said at the scene of the shooting last Saturday. In Palestinian communities, he said, ""there are enclaves without law enforcement, with Islamist propaganda, with plenty of weapons often fired during wedding celebrations, with constant crime."" Members of the Joint List, a coalition of Palestinian-dominated political parties in the Israeli Knesset, condemned the Tel Aviv attack without reservation. But Ayman Odeh, the coalition's chairman, also argued that Netanyahu's remarks instigated resentment against Palestinian citizens. “I listened to the comments of Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] and I saw a human being that just incites,” Odeh said.The following day, Palestinian citizens, including students at Tel Aviv University, reported instances of Israeli police raiding their homes without search warrants or identification -- and often quite aggressively. None of them had any direct connection to the suspect, but they, like Melhem, were Palestinian.Then, Monday evening, Netanyahu appeared to reverse course on a government aid package for Palestinians in Israel. The heart of the plan, passed just two days before the Tel Aviv shooting, is the allocation of $2.5 billion in economic aid. Netanyahu announced that two of his cabinet ministers would be overseeing the five-year plan to ensure that recipients complied with conditions for receiving the aid. One of those ministers told Israeli newspaper Haaretz that the aid had been conditional on beefing up police presence and enforcing housing laws from the get-go and that Netanyahu’s gesture was aimed only at furthering that goal.But Palestinian parliamentarians and human rights advocates cried foul, accusing Netanyahu of stealthily attempting to walk back the aid in retaliation for the shooting.Tom Mehager, a spokesman for Adalah, the Haifa-based legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel, noted that the aid package was billed as an initiative to restore equality, something to which all citizens are entitled. He also said the police raids during the manhunt reflected widespread racial profiling of Palestinian citizens.“Netanyahu thinks of equality as conditional, not as an intrinsic right of citizens, and that Arabs are always suspect,” Mehager said. “They always look at them as suspects.”Netanyahu’s record does not inspire confidence in activists. The day of the Israeli elections, he tried to drive turnout among his conservative base by warning that Arabs were coming to the polls in “droves.” The White House was so angry at Netanyahu's remarks that it refused to back away from its criticism even after Netanyahu publicly apologized to Palestinian Israeli leaders.On Dec. 31, Netanyahu's education ministry also refused to include a book about an Israeli-Palestinian love affair in school curricula, apparently out of fear that it would encourage intermarriage.Mehager, of Adalah, said anti-Palestinian incidents have become more common in recent years with the rise of reactionary politicians like former foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, who publicly questioned Palestinian citizens' loyalty to Israel and argued that they should be required to sign a loyalty oath.“The situation has deteriorated,” Mehager said. “The whole idea of citizenship is that it is not something you can take from someone. In Israel, the legitimate discourse, particularly after Lieberman, is that the citizenship of Palestinians living in Israel is at the discretion or whim of the Israeli government.”Reports of discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel in the past week have not been limited to the government. Two Palestinian Israelis were removed from an Aegean Airlines flight to Greece on Monday night -- having already passed through Israel’s airport security -- when Jewish passengers insisted they were a security threat and needed to be expelled. The complaining passengers stood up in the aisles, creating enough of a fuss to prevent the airplane from taking off.“Imagine what it’s like to be an Arab citizen in Israel today -- only dread and despair,” Gideon Levy, a famously provocative progressive columnist for Haaretz, wrote in response to the week’s events. “You live in your country on probation. No authority will help you.”“Perhaps soon we’ll have flights for Jews only,” Levy mused darkly.Meanwhile, the ability of Adalah and other groups to monitor discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel is about to be challenged. Israel’s Knesset will soon vote on a bill requiring NGOs, like Adalah, that receive more than half of their funding from foreign entities to disclose their funding details in all their material. Their representatives would also be required to wear special tags when appearing in the Knesset. While the new regulations would not explicitly restrict their activities, the groups, and even many Israeli lawmakers who disagree with their work, believe it would expose them to unnecessary scrutiny and discrimination.The bill’s opponents argue that it unfairly targets progressive nonprofits advocating for Palestinian human rights inside Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories. The U.S. State Department has said that it has expressed its concerns about the bill to the Israeli government.European officials have also openly condemned the bill, with a pro-Israel German lawmaker comparing it to similar legislation in Russia that has had a chilling effect on human rights advocacy.Also on HuffPost:"

Our teams struggle on a daily basis to ensure the respect of health facilities,"" MSF wrote. An earlier tweet by the group described the projectile as a rocket.Regional MSF operations chief Raquel Ayora said all warring parties are regularly informed of the GPS coordinates of the medical sites where the group works, and that MSF was in constant dialog with them.""There is no way that anyone with the capacity to carry out an air strike or launch a rocket would not have known that the Shiara Hospital was a functioning health facility providing critical services and supported by MSF,"" she said.MSF said Saudi-led air strikes hit another of its health facilities elsewhere in the province in October last year, wrecking the building and lightly wounding two staff members.A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia has been fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group in Yemen, a campaign Riyadh says is aimed at repelling at what it sees as creeping Iranian influence in the Arabian Peninsula region.Nearly 6,000 people have been killed since the Saudi coalition entered Yemen's conflict in March, almost half of them civilians. The war has exacerbated hunger and disease in Yemen, the region's poorest country.In a separate incident, an intelligence colonel was killed in a drive-by shooting in Yemen's southern port city of Aden on Sunday, a security official source said, in an attack claimed by Islamic State militants.It was the latest in a series of assassination and bombings by militants belonging to the Yemen branch of the ultra-violent group which have undermined security in Aden, the temporary capital of the embattled Yemeni central government.Also on HuffPost:"

But the alcohol-soaked chair caught fire.The seat and his body went up in flames, which spread to the rest of his eighth-floor apartment at the St. Antoine Gardens complex in Midtown. The man escaped the devastating blaze but suffered severe burns, according to CBS Detroit.Johanahn Larsosa, another resident at the complex, saw the man in the lobby and prayed with him at his request before emergency crews arrived.

Two dozen more apartments suffered severe water damage, the Detroit Free Press reported.The blaze has displaced multiple residents of the 120-unit building, which mainly houses people on Section 8 assistance, WXYZ reported. Others are unable to take showers or cook in their apartments, and some tenants are sleeping on cots in the community room.Cleveland-based Millennia Housing Management, which manages the complex, said it was restoring four of the 10 units the city inspector ruled uninhabitable, and would clean the others up as soon as possible.

10,POLITICS,The Story Of Sheldon Adelson's Purchase Of A Las Vegas Paper Is Even Crazier Than You Think,Peter Stone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheldon-adelson-las-vegas-review-journal-newspaper_us_568fe733e4b0cad15e647ea1,"Legal, political and media scandals collided.",2016-01-10,The role played by Connecticut newspaper publisher Michael Schroeder (seen left with two Connecticut lawmakers in 2009) in promoting Adelson's interests has raised many eyebrows.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_22_60_2349_1660%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Three months before a mysterious article popped up in an obscure Connecticut newspaper criticizing a judge overseeing a lawsuit against Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson and his casino empire, freelance reporter Scott Whipple received a lucrative proposal from his old boss.Meeting at the small paper's New Britain offices, publisher and editor Michael Schroeder offered Whipple $5,000 to write a piece about Nevada judicial decisions.This was unusual, to say the least. Whipple, a veteran business reporter who had recently retired, had accepted some freelancing projects from his former employer, but Schroeder had never offered him a sum that large before. And the assignment seemed completely unrelated to the usual issues covered by the New Britain Herald and its sister paper, The Bristol Press.Whipple, who had spent 17 years at the papers, said in an interview that he asked Schroeder what the job entailed. Schroeder called it a ""project"" looking at Nevada judges who were handling business cases and mentioned Adelson's name. To get him up to speed, Whipple recalled, Schroeder gave him a 40-page dossier comprising court documents and some newspaper clips.After mulling the idea for a few days, Whipple decided to pass since the assignment didn't mesh with his reporting experience and sounded unorthodox. ""I couldn't understand the relevance to Connecticut and the Herald,"" Whipple said with a touch of understatement. Schroeder, he added, asked if he knew of anyone else who might undertake the project. No one came to mind.Whipple's decision was prescient.Schroeder's offer to the reporter, which has not been previously reported, turned out to be one of the first acts in an unmitigated journalistic disaster. On Dec. 1, the inflammatory story -- about one-quarter of which focused on the Nevada judge overseeing the Adelson case -- appeared in the two Connecticut papers. Allegations soon arose that sections of it had been plagiarized from other publications. The story was bylined by ""Edward Clarkin,"" a person who didn't seem to actually exist. The name may have been a nom de plume for Schroeder, whose middle name is Edward and whose mother's maiden name was Clarkin. A few of the people quoted in the story have since said they never spoke to anyone from the paper for the article. And the article's extended critique of rulings by Nevada state Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez as ""inconsistent"" and ""contradictory"" -- Gonzalez is hearing the suit against Adelson --- struck readers as oddly out of place in a New England outlet.In three phone interviews in recent weeks, Schroeder declined to answer well over a dozen queries, including questions about the genesis of the story and whether he knew Edward Clarkin. Asked if he valued openness and transparency in the media, he replied, ""Absolutely.""Friction between Judge Gonzalez and Adelson, the 82-year-old CEO of casino giant Las Vegas Sands Corp., had developed well before the story's publication. The judge, who sits on the Eighth Judicial District Court in Las Vegas, has been overseeing a high-stakes wrongful termination lawsuit against the billionaire and his company filed in 2010. That suit was brought by Steven Jacobs, a former senior executive at the Sands' most lucrative gambling franchise in Macau, China. In 2015 pretrial hearings, Gonzalez fined the Sands $250,000 for withholding documents and chastised Adelson for his conduct on the witness stand.""Sir, you don't get to argue with me,"" Gonzalez said. ""You understand that?""The wrongful termination suit, which is slated to go to trial in mid-2016, includes charges by Jacobs that Adelson and the company had directed him to continue working with a Macau lawyer and legislator despite Jacobs' concerns that payments to that individual might violate U.S. anti-bribery laws. Adelson has vehemently denied these and other allegations of unethical practices, calling the accusations ""delusional"" and insisting that Jacobs was fired for cause.But the lawsuit ignited an ongoing federal criminal probe into whether the Sands violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies from using bribery to win business abroad. The Sands acknowledged in a 2013 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had ""likely"" violated accounting provisions of the anti-bribery statute, but maintained that it had not engaged in any actual bribery.Amidst the legal headaches, Adelson recently placed a hefty bet on expanding his influence in the media world with a helping hand from Schroeder.In late 2015, a mysterious buyer ponied up $140 million to purchase Nevada's largest paper, the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Details of the deal were first uncovered by the Review-Journal itself. They showed that Adelson's family had acquired the paper through a Delaware corporation called News & Media Capital Group LLC. That corporation had been established only a few months earlier, and Schroeder reportedly played a key part as its manager. Before Adelson's involvement was confirmed, Schroeder had appeared in the Review-Journal's newsroom to discuss the purchase by the new owners. He had told the staff not to ""worry who [the owners] are,"" but just to ""focus"" on their own jobs -- statements that set off alarm bells.The ties between Schroeder and Adelson seem to stem from Schroeder's stint as publisher of a now-defunct free daily called Boston Now. The CEO of that daily, Russel Pergament, served briefly as a consultant in 2007 when Adelson, long an ardent champion of Israel, launched a free daily in that country called Israel Hayom. (Hayom is a staunchly conservative paper that backs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.) Two sources familiar with Pergament's advisory work for Adelson's paper say that Pergament flew to Israel accompanied by Schroeder and spent a few days meeting with Hayom staff.The relationship grew from there. According to Connecticut sources, starting around 2012, Schroeder's small New Britain and Bristol papers started using material on their religion pages from the fledgling Jewish News Service. Pergament was the publisher of that conservative wire service, which had started up the year before with sizable funding from Adelson.Prior to the purchase of the Review-Journal last month, several sources familiar with Schroeder's work say that he visited Las Vegas on a few occasions for meetings with, among others, Pat Dumont, a top executive with the Sands and Adelson’s son-in-law. The sources say that Dumont played a significant role in orchestrating the purchase of the Review-Journal, while Schroeder served as a front man and an adviser who handled some of the ""due diligence"" that typically goes with acquisitions.Adelson, whom several leading GOP presidential candidates have spent long hours wooing him for his big checkbook, paid some $40 million more for the Review-Journal than it had fetched earlier in 2015 when it was sold to another media company. But given Adelson's net worth of nearly $23 billion, the $140 million for the paper was relative chump change -- roughly $10 million less than he donated to super PACs and ""dark money"" nonprofits during the 2012 elections.Still, the purchase of the Review-Journal under murky circumstances sparked fear, criticism and concern about the paper's future. In early November, before the purchase was completed, Mike Hengel, the top editor at the Review-Journal, and other senior editors reportedly received a highly unusual order to assign three reporters to observe three Nevada judges, including Gonzales, for two weeks. That order, which came from the prior management with whom Adelson and his family were then negotiating, was issued just two days after a ruling by the Nevada Supreme Court that thwarted efforts by Adelson's lawyers to have Gonzalez removed from the wrongful termination case, according to The New York Times. The Sands' lawyers had argued that the judge's comments and rulings indicated she was biased against the company and Adelson.Hengel and the reporters were upset by the bizarre assignment, which the editor blasted as a ""waste of time and resources."" But they effectively had no choice in the matter. The reporters wrote up 15,000 words on the three judges, none of which ultimately appeared in the Las Vegas paper.Still, the timing of the assignment -- during the negotiations with the Adelson family to buy the paper and right before the publication of the Clarkin article criticizing Gonzalez -- has raised eyebrows.""This seems to be a misuse of investigative reporters for a largely private purpose,"" said Jack Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in corporate and white-collar criminal law issues. ""This is turning Woodward and Bernstein into private thugs,"" he added, referencing the Washington Post journalists who uncovered Watergate.Mark Fabiani, a high-profile crisis manager tapped by the paper following the Adelson purchase, noted that ""there were no stories published in the Las Vegas Review-Journal on the court system -- except for the stories written in 2014 and before under the paper's prior owners.""However, Fabiani declined to respond to questions about whether anyone from Adelson's family or their representatives involved in negotiating the purchase raised the matter of the lawsuit or Judge Gonzalez with the then-management of the paper. Fabiani also didn't respond to queries about Schroeder's role in the negotiations.Since the deal to buy the Review-Journal was announced on Dec. 10, there has been major turmoil in the paper's newsroom. Less than two weeks after the story broke, Hengel announced that he was resigning and taking a buyout. This week, Glenn Cook, who ran the editorial pages, was named interim editor.Schroeder declined to discuss his role, as manager of News & Media Capital Group, in the Nevada paper's acquisition. Asked last month if he thought the deal had been handled according to the open and transparent values that he had just espoused, he replied, ""No comment.""This week, however, Schroeder seemed to switch gears, writing a somewhat puzzling apology for running the Clarkin story that caused so much ruckus. The tone was contrite, as though Schroeder had only now recognized the flaws in the article -- including the failure to reveal his ties to an Adelson-backed company, the apparent plagiarism of other published material and the use of the false byline.The day before Schroeder's apologetic note ran in his Connecticut papers, Fabiani told the Review-Journal that Schroeder was out as manager of News & Media Capital Group (a move that had been hinted at late last year and was greeted well by Review-Journal staffers). Fabiani told HuffPost that neither he nor others with the Adelson family ownership team had suggested Schroeder write an apology. But he declined to say whether he or they had any input in its crafting.One thing Fabiani did acknowledge was that he had previously done consulting work for Adelson's Sands empire. A well-placed source said that Fabiani's entree into that world was facilitated, in part, by the famed Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, who has represented Adelson on some matters and recently lost the appeal to have the billionaire businessman's case moved out of Gonzalez's court."

The deformity could also be a rare teratoma tumor, the department wrote.“These kinds of tumors are composed of tissue from which teeth, hair, and even fingers and toes can develop,” it said. “Biologists from the southeast region of Idaho Fish and Game have never seen anything like this particular deformity before.""It’s not clear what will happen to the cat’s body, though officials say the hunter is not required to turn it over for further analysis.Tyler Olson said the cat’s attack on his dog on Dec. 30 initiated the hunt.“My first response was to scream and wave it off,” he told Fox 13, describing finding the cat just feet from his front door.The dog suffered puncture wounds but survived the attack, Olson said. Still, concern that it could attack again pushed some neighbors to mount a hunt for the cat.“They tracked it down and got it later in the afternoon, brought it to show us,” Olson said. ""I did see that weird feature on its head and you know, handled it. It was pretty strange.”Mountain lion hunting is legal in Idaho during set seasons and with appropriate licenses and tags, wildlife officials said.Also on HuffPost:"

15,BUSINESS,Emotions Impact Your Work -- So Why Don't Companies Take Mental Health Seriously?,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mental-health-at-work_us_566ad6aee4b009377b24992a,"Mental health in the workplace is neglected and rarely, if ever, addressed, according to an expert.",2016-01-10,"There's little support in the workplace for employees who struggle with mental health issues, some experts say.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5671869b1600002c00eb8f43.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story is part of our monthlong “Work Well” initiative, which focuses on thriving in the workplace. You can find more stories from this project here.One somewhat unfortunate reality of living in the United States is that health care is inexorably tied up with employment, for better or for worse.On the plus side, employers generally provide health insurance at a subsidized rate and may have other programs to encourage better physical health in the workplace. But there's more to health than physical well-being, and companies often fall short on the mental health front.Mental health in the workplace is neglected and rarely, if ever, addressed, says Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, the chair of the psychiatry department at Columbia NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. When companies do address it, he says, ""it’s addressed in kind of a touchy-feely, motherhood-and-apple-pie kind of way."" Essentially, we don't take mental health as seriously as we take our physical well being.To some extent, corporations are beginning to realize that employees' emotions affect their productivity. Many companies, including The Huffington Post, offer opportunities for their workers to participate in yoga and meditation. Others provide full fitness centers or wellness counseling.But those are mostly environmental changes. As a society, we have a hard time getting serious about the clinical side of mental health because there is still a stigma attached to it.""What doesn’t get addressed [by companies] is the more medical side of mental health,"" according to Lieberman. There's little support at work for employees who struggle with mental illness or are just more susceptible to it.It's hard to pin down the exact number of people living with a mental illness, but estimates range from 10 to 30 percent of U.S. adults. This is a large enough portion of the population to assume that most workplaces have some employees who need mental health support.Yet ""it’s the third rail of HR; nobody wants to go there,"" says Lieberman.There's not much government support, either. Worker's compensation claims, for example, allow employees to get monetary support when they're injured on the job. But every state has specific policies, and not all states cover mental health issues -- even very serious ones, like if someone witnesses a traumatic event at work and then develops post-traumatic stress disorder.This becomes even more important for professionals who have intensely stressful jobs -- like firefighters, policemen or doctors. But the support just isn't there. ""Many of our first responders are dealing with addiction and post-traumatic stress or some other form of mental health issues, "" says Peggy Sweeney, who started her own organization, the Sweeney Alliance, to help counsel first responders and their families. ""Unfortunately, many departments don’t offer any type of help to these people.""New York City firefighter Mike Ayello told HuffPost that he loves his job and can't imagine doing anything else. But he also described using a range of coping mechanisms to get through his work. ""Every time you get called it’s for an emergency. At the end of the day, you just have to kind of shut yourself off a bit,"" he said.Ayello said counseling is available for his department, but it's not very popular. He says he just tries not to ""take anything home"" with him.The Huffington Post’s “Work Well” series is also part of our ""What's Working"" solutions-oriented journalism initiative.More stories like this: 12 Work Hacks To Keep You Sharp And Focused Throughout The DayAlso on HuffPost:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5692029a1b00002d006750e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Heeeeeeey, brother.Beloved by many but watched by few, ""Arrested Development"" was resurrected by Netflix in 2013, seven years after Fox pulled the plug on the criminally low-rated sitcom. Where were you then, America?!But the fourth season of the cult series -- the first on the streaming service -- provoked a mixed response, due largely to its frustrating narrative structure. Each episode centered around a single character, severely decreasing the amount of big family scenes, which remain some of the strongest in the series' history. (The chicken dance, anyone?)We sat down recently with actor Tony Hale, who plays Byron ""Buster"" Bluth, the baby of the Bluth family, to discuss what's in store for the series fifth season, his all-time favorite Buster scene and how the Bluths will be more united than ever. Once described as ""odd and alienating"" in our all-time favorite episode, ""Public Relations,"" Buster quickly made his mark, participating in some of the series' most memorable gags like Motherboy XXX (""Operation: Hot Mother""), a violent tangle with a carnivorous seal and, of course, his love affair with Liza Minnelli's character, Lucille 2. Busy schedules were an obstacle to filming in the fourth season, Hale said.""It was really tough to pull everybody together for the fourth season, so I know [series creator Mitchell Hurwitz] has said that he wants to have a lot more ensemble scenes where everybody is together,"" Hale told The Huffington Post. ""That’s a goal of theirs."" Thank you, Buster, for quieting the worries of this ""Arrested Development"" fanatic.At least 17 more episodes of the show will air before the Bluths take their final bow, executive producer Brian Glazer confirmed last year.The new season will be structured like a serialized mystery surrounding the murder of Minnelli's character Lucille Austero in the vein of true crime docs like ""Making a Murderer"" or ""The Jinx."" Hurwitz also revealed that Donald Trump will get a few knocks, considering the fourth season's absurdist border plot became a political reality thanks to the GOP front-runner. ""What I appreciate about it is that there’s no formula it fits. It’s always a surprise,"" Hale said. On the show's return for a fifth season, he added, ""Any chance we have, we cannot get there fast enough.""Hale said these ""surprises"" are what keeps it exciting as an actor, never knowing what kind of trouble Buster will stumble into. That is, if he's ever seen or heard.""I do remember going up to Mitch Hurwitz and having an idea once what if Buster was on ‘Dancing with the Stars,’"" Hale said. ""He was like, 'Oh, that’s funny, but I think I’m going to have a seal bite off your hand.'""And so it did.Um, raise your hand (sorry, too soon?) if you'd watch Buster beat out some dancing D-listers for that Mirrorball trophy. Buster's amputation at sea might be his most memorable scene, but Hale remembers one other that stands out. ""My favorite scene of all is when Jeffrey [Tambor] and Jason [Bateman] are having a conversation and you don’t realize Buster is there,"" he said.""The camera pans, and then you see him. I want more of that. People talking about Buster and he’s just right in the corner not even aware of it.""""I also loved any time that Buster would be creative [saying] 'Hey, step brother' or 'Hey, father uncle,'"" Hale added. Whatever happens next, the two-time Emmy winner said he can't wait for the story to continue, especially considering the prospect of sharing more scenes with his uproarious cast members.Since the show first aired, many of the series' stars have become some of the most in-demand comedians and actors in the game. Michael Cera and Jason Bateman headlined big-budget Hollywood comedies after the show ended, while Jeffrey Tambor surprised everyone with his tour-de-force performance as Maura on ""Transparent.""We asked Hale to describe each of his cast members in one word, and here's what he had to say. (Disclaimer: Alia Shawkat didn't make the list because an interviewer who shall not be named got too excited telling a story about how he sat behind the actress during a performance of ""Spring Awakening"" and stared at the back of her head for two hours. Our deepest apologies, Lea Michele!)Jason Bateman: ""'The Gift' I just saw it. He was fantastic.""Will Arnett: ""Voice. He’s got a resonance that actors would kill for.""Portia de Rossi: ""Horses. She loves riding horses.""Jessica Walter: ""Timing. Because she can do it like no one else.""Jeffrey Tambor: ""Experience.""David Cross: ""Smart.""Michael Cera: ""Kindness.""So kind, so gentle. Netflix hasn't announced a premiere date for the much-anticipated fifth season, but executive producer Grazer said that production will start in January or February of 2016 and new episodes would debut around four months after shooting starts. Translation: the new season should be ready to go by spring or summer.In the meantime, you can catch Hale on HBO's hit ""Veep"" as Gary Walsh, Vice President Selina Myer's personal aide. The fifth season launches April 24 and promises to be even more chaotic than the last, if that's even possible. Hale also recently partnered with Subway on #SaveLunchBreak, a campaign that encourages people ""to get out of the office and back to their lunch breaks."" In the three videos conceived and written by Hale and friend Bryan Belknap, the patron saint of lunch breaks puts his comedic talents to good use, doing just about anything to make hungry workers pick up a sandwich (turkey is Hale's favorite, by the way.)

In other words, we can't let impressionable teens read about Israeli-Palestinian relationships, because then they might go around falling in love with their fellow human beings and being insufficiently anxious about political institutions.Time Out's viral video, which as of Saturday had more than 230,000 views on YouTube, brings together couples, friends and a few pairs of strangers to do the ""forbidden deed"" on camera. Some couples are same-sex, others are opposite-sex. The only thing they all have in common is that they each pair an Arab person and a Jewish person.In a statement posted with the video, Time Out editors said that the video's message seemed especially timely after the latest episode in the Arab-Israeli conflict -- a deadly shooting last week at a bar in Tel Aviv that left two people dead and eight more injured. ""All this gratuitous hatred is not good for us,"" the editors wrote in their statement, ""so we decided to balance a little bit with the 'extreme other side,' unconditional love.""Time Out editor Nof Nathansohn told The Huffington Post in an email that the video had been in the works since last month, but that ""we thought it would be an optimistic way to end this violent difficult week in Israel.""When asked how it felt to kiss a stranger on camera, one of the men in the video says that it's ""less strange than the [Arab-Israeli] conflict,"" according to Haaretz. On Thursday, the video mysteriously disappeared from Facebook, which denies having taken it down on its end. Although Facebook sometimes removes content for violating standards, this does not appear to be the case here. The company said it was internally investigating why the video disappeared.Speaking to the BBC in late December, Rabinyan said ""the fear that your identity can be taken over"" is omnipresent in Israel, the only sovereign Jewish state in the world, which might explain why some officials are so afraid of the idea of assimilation.But, Rabinyan went on, the funny thing is that she explores this very fear of assimilation with her novel's female protagonist, so ""it's ironic that my choice to project this fear, and to look into this fear, is the same reason that my book is banned.""In recent years, social media has occasionally been a forum for Jewish-Arab expressions of solidarity. In 2014, the slogan ""Jews and Arabs refuse to be enemies"" made waves across Facebook and Twitter.Also on HuffPost:"

""He was interested in seeing the story of his life told on film, but would entrust its telling only to Kate.”Three years ago, del Castillo tweeted an open letter to Guzman about ""trafficking with love,"" saying she believed ""more in El Chapo Guzmán than in the governments that hide all the truths."" This led the fugitive to reach out to her through his attorney, according to Penn.Guzman, in contrast to Castillo's message of love, made his living as the leader of one of the world's most powerful and violent drug cartels, according to authorities. (In his interview with Penn, Guzman reportedly says, ""I supply more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world. I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats."")But del Castillo, who played a drug kingpin in the Telemundo soap opera ""La Reina del Sur"" and also voiced a character in the 2014 animated movie ""The Book of Life,"" suggested he use his power for something positive.""Life is a business and the only thing that changes is the merchandise. Don't you agree?"" she tweeted to him, according to the Rolling Stone article.The actress reportedly faced backlash for her message from the public as well as high-ranking officials, some of whom privately tried to intimidate her. Guzman, however, asked for her address so he could send her flowers.So began their long back-and-forth communications, which continued even while Guzman was last incarcerated at Mexico’s most secure facility, Altiplano prison, Penn wrote. While there, the drug lord was inundated with letters suggesting a movie be made about his life.Read Penn's entire interview with El Chapo here.At a social event in Los Angeles, del Castillo met with a man identified only as “Espinoza,” according to Penn’s account. (The actor notes that some of the names in the article have been changed. The time of this meeting was also not provided.)The two got to talking, and del Castillo proposed making a film about Guzman together. Then entered Penn.""We would join Kate, who was our ticket to El Chapo's trust, then put ourselves in the hands of representatives of the Sinaloa cartel to coordinate our journey,” Penn wrote.When they finally met, in an area of Mexico only described as a mountainous jungle clearing, Penn said Guzman opened del Castillo’s car door and greeted her “like a daughter returning from college.""Later that night at dinner, Penn wrote, Guzman pours them tequila and tells her: ""I don't usually drink … but I want to drink with you.""On Friday, just hours before the article’s publishing, Guzman was captured following a gunfight in Los Mochis, Mexico.A Mexican law enforcement official speaking to the Associated Press said it was Penn's secret interview that helped authorities locate Guzman.In his piece, Penn wrote that he had no doubt that U.S. anti-drug agents and the Mexican government were tracking their movements while they were across the border meeting with Guzman.Both Penn and del Castillo are now under investigation for their secret meeting, according to ABC News.Also on HuffPost:"

I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats."")But del Castillo, who played a drug kingpin in the Telemundo soap opera ""La Reina del Sur"" and also voiced a character in the 2014 animated movie ""The Book of Life,"" suggested he use his power for something positive.""Life is a business and the only thing that changes is the merchandise. Don't you agree?"" she tweeted to him, according to the Rolling Stone article.The actress reportedly faced backlash for her message from the public as well as high-ranking officials, some of whom privately tried to intimidate her. Guzman, however, asked for her address so he could send her flowers.So began their long back-and-forth communications, which continued even while Guzman was last incarcerated at Mexico’s most secure facility, Altiplano prison, Penn wrote. While there, the drug lord was inundated with letters suggesting a movie be made about his life.Read Penn's entire interview with El Chapo here.At a social event in Los Angeles, del Castillo met with a man identified only as “Espinoza,” according to Penn’s account. (The actor notes that some of the names in the article have been changed. The time of this meeting was also not provided.)The two got to talking, and del Castillo proposed making a film about Guzman together. Then entered Penn.""We would join Kate, who was our ticket to El Chapo's trust, then put ourselves in the hands of representatives of the Sinaloa cartel to coordinate our journey,” Penn wrote.When they finally met, in an area of Mexico only described as a mountainous jungle clearing, Penn said Guzman opened del Castillo’s car door and greeted her “like a daughter returning from college.""Later that night at dinner, Penn wrote, Guzman pours them tequila and tells her: ""I don't usually drink … but I want to drink with you.""On Friday, just hours before the article’s publishing, Guzman was captured following a gunfight in Los Mochis, Mexico.A Mexican law enforcement official speaking to the Associated Press said it was Penn's secret interview that helped authorities locate Guzman.In his piece, Penn wrote that he had no doubt that U.S. anti-drug agents and the Mexican government were tracking their movements while they were across the border meeting with Guzman.Both Penn and del Castillo are now under investigation for their secret meeting, according to ABC News.Also on HuffPost:"

Zinny is the founder and president of Kuepa.com, a blended learning startup that provides continuing education for adults who do not have the required skill sets to work in today's labor market. He is also the author of Educacion 3.0. The Struggle for Talent in Latin America, in which he addresses the critical need for educational transformation, both in the United States and Latin America, given the shifting nature of the global economy. In my interview with Zinny in The Global Search for Education, he discusses the challenges faced in Latin America, how blended learning companies like Kuepa will help, and what the future holds for traditional vs. the newer models of higher education. ""To create truly advanced economic sectors that can power a broader rise in living standards, it will be imperative to equip workers at all levels with the skills necessary to succeed. And we won't achieve that without a stronger technical and vocational sector."" -- Gabriel Sanchez ZinnyAs you've argued, education is a key to economic success but demand is exceeding supply, particularly in emerging economies, like Latin America. How can this be changed? Data from the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys shows that the Latin American private sector struggles more than that of any other region to find the right talent. Over 35 percent of Latin American companies say that an inadequately trained workforce is their primary impediment to expansion, versus just 22 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa and 17 percent in South Asia. Local governments have been attacking the problem for some time, with little to show for it. One of the oldest, Colombia's National Learning Service (SENA), was formed in 1957, and one of the newest, Brazil's Bolsa Escola program, has been in effect since 2001. Argentina, Mexico, and Chile have launched similar efforts, but even with big budgets and expansive bureaucracies, the same education underachievement persists.The problem is more complex than many realize. Just joining the labor force is often no longer enough to start developing skills, especially in sectors where automation is replacing human labor. In these generally high-tech industries, the skills needed are much more sophisticated, requiring higher order creative problem-solving abilities as well as technical knowledge.At the same time, while returns to highly skilled jobs are increasing, those benefits are not always clear to the individuals making education decisions. Here is one place that government could play a role: providing accurate, transparent, and easy-to-access information about which career paths are most in demand and what skills must be acquired to follow that path. The regulatory environment is another challenge. The lack of clear regulation means that it can be impossible to tell quality institutions from the fraudulent. At the same time, successful schools and programs find it difficult to succeed and expand, given the less than transparent requirements involved. Governments must be able to effectively evaluate the quality of new educational institutions, and crack down on those that are failing. Government programs are uniquely positioned to provide objective information and oversight, as well to provide the long term unemployed with skills training that can get them back into a productive place in the labor force.As Latin America comes down from a decade of growth based on exporting commodities at high world prices, it faces the next challenge: transitioning to a higher-productivity economy. Maintaining macroeconomic stability will be crucial, as will be developing infrastructure and continuing to tackle poverty. But to create truly advanced economic sectors that can power a broader rise in living standards, it will be imperative to equip workers at all levels with the skills necessary to succeed. And we won't achieve that without a stronger technical and vocational sector. ""By streamlining the 'information absorption' aspect of education, online learning can free up traditional schools to do more of what they do best - that is, the more complex processes of discussing, reflecting on, and synthesizing information into new ideas, which is best done in person, through conversation and collaboration.""  -- Gabriel Sanchez ZinnyHow are Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and sites like your own kuepa.com, impacting the global education landscape? Online learning dramatically expands student access to quality instruction - now billions can ""attend"" the lectures of the best teachers, instead of only hundreds. Perhaps more importantly, by streamlining the ""information absorption"" aspect of education, online learning can free up traditional schools to do more of what they do best - that is, the more complex processes of discussing, reflecting on, and synthesizing information into new ideas, which is best done in person, through conversation and collaboration.Clearly, online education is serving a slice of the population that has for too long been neglected. While the debate still remains open about the level of quality that the sector is capable of delivering, it is offering a valid alternative for working adults or marginalized students who would otherwise receive little or no education. Kuepa was founded a few years ago under the inspiration of this model, soon becoming the first blended learning initiative in the region and expanding to Mexico, Peru and Colombia. The high dropout rates and a rising awareness of the need to improve educational quality, together with a flourishing entrepreneurial environment and a solid and rapid expansion of ICT use and digital inclusion in the region (among the highest in the world), provided the context for the birth of Kuepa. The initiative seeks to serve a population of adults that do not have the required skills to work in the competitive 21st century labor market. Kuepa wants to contribute, through the introduction of blended learning, to improve performance, leverage teacher capacities and boost productivity and competitiveness among young workers in Latin America. What role do you see MOOCs playing in the future of education? How will they affect the price and prominence of the university system? Technology is outpacing the need for traditional infrastructure and other fixed investments that have, for many years, been the cornerstone of the brick and mortar university system. Digital libraries are just one example - as the marginal cost of hosting books, videos, and other resources online falls dramatically, new providers have an opportunity to enter the market. MOOCs reach millions without the need for as much as a single dormitory.Thus, the old ways of evaluating educational institutions have become obsolete. Teaching and learning can now easily be exported and imported, a trend embraced by leading universities like Mexico's Tecnológico de Monterrey, which now has more than 50,000 students outside of the country taking its courses.Platforms based in the U.S. and Europe, too, are seeing new success in the Latin American education market. EdX, based in Boston and co-founded by MIT, is expanding rapidly in countries from Brazil to Haiti - a full 10 percent of the 1.3 million people accessing EdX MOOCs are now based in the region. In the UK, there is the Open University, which caters to students across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, and which is expanding its marketing to Latin America.This rise of education entrepreneurs and the expansion of online learning are both responses to a sector that is in the midst of a profound, and long-overdue, disruption.

Concepts like lifelong learning and twenty-first century skills are no longer simply trendy buzzwords, but on-the-ground reality.""  -- Gabriel Sanchez ZinnyWhat will it take to raise the reputation of MOOCs so that they will be seen as rigorous alternatives or supplements to a traditional university degree? What evidence is there that this is happening already?With increasing economic growth, and the subsequent expansion of the middle class in regions like Latin America, there is a new market being created for quality post-secondary education. With the rise in local demands for educational services, new providers in both the nonprofit and for profit sectors are getting involved. Indeed, over the past decade, Latin America has seen billions invested in its higher education sector.Regional businesses are increasingly basing their hiring on specific skill sets and competencies, rather than credentials from prestigious schools (not unlike Google in the U.S.). At the same time, a burgeoning but underprepared young work force is clamoring for better education, pushing the price of traditional universities upward and straining their infrastructure.Thus, even while the right education is more valuable than ever, the public perception that traditional schools are overpriced, overcrowded, and irrelevant to the modern workplace has contributed to an atmosphere of crisis. Students are increasingly graduating with overwhelming debt and few job prospects, leading to explosive discontent in places like Chile and Colombia, not to mention the United States.In this context, private, lower-cost, largely online options are well positioned to reshape education more fundamentally.

Where's the obligation on the part of employers to root out and remedy their pay gaps? Real pay transparency and accountability to taxpayers on the part of contractors can be done, as experience is beginning to show at state and local levels. Contractors can be required to disclose gender pay statistics by job category as a condition of bidding on a contract - a system pioneered at the state level by then-Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico in 2010. That approach was toughened and expanded by Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry in 2014, when the city not only required reporting, but began awarding a premium to bidders showing fair pay for women and men working in the same job categories. The reports at both levels are publicly available. And guess what? It's a bi-partisan issue. Richardson is a Democrat and Berry is a Republican.Other jurisdictions are in various stages of planning or crafting similar initiatives -- most notably the State of Missouri, cities such as San Francisco, New York and Tempe, Arizona, Erie County New York and Bernalillo County, New Mexico. That's very good news, but progress should not depend on geography or local leaders alone.Obama's timid steps have shown that it's within the purview of the president to require assurance from federal contractors that our tax dollars are being spent fairly and wisely. (A separate ""Memorandum"" was issued at the same time as the executive order requiring the Department of Labor to develop a way to collect some pay statistics, but in the unlikely case it's ever actually implemented the info won't be public.) Female voters are now the majority, and have the ability to control any election. Let's hope they ask aspirants to the Oval Office whether they stand with women -- or stand with big business -- when it comes to new and stronger executive action to finally close the gender pay gap."

Real pay transparency and accountability to taxpayers on the part of contractors can be done, as experience is beginning to show at state and local levels. Contractors can be required to disclose gender pay statistics by job category as a condition of bidding on a contract - a system pioneered at the state level by then-Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico in 2010. That approach was toughened and expanded by Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry in 2014, when the city not only required reporting, but began awarding a premium to bidders showing fair pay for women and men working in the same job categories. The reports at both levels are publicly available. And guess what? It's a bi-partisan issue. Richardson is a Democrat and Berry is a Republican.Other jurisdictions are in various stages of planning or crafting similar initiatives -- most notably the State of Missouri, cities such as San Francisco, New York and Tempe, Arizona, Erie County New York and Bernalillo County, New Mexico. That's very good news, but progress should not depend on geography or local leaders alone.Obama's timid steps have shown that it's within the purview of the president to require assurance from federal contractors that our tax dollars are being spent fairly and wisely. (A separate ""Memorandum"" was issued at the same time as the executive order requiring the Department of Labor to develop a way to collect some pay statistics, but in the unlikely case it's ever actually implemented the info won't be public.) Female voters are now the majority, and have the ability to control any election. Let's hope they ask aspirants to the Oval Office whether they stand with women -- or stand with big business -- when it comes to new and stronger executive action to finally close the gender pay gap."

""Every week I have to meet with a caseworker, which requires driving about 18 miles to the nearest town, and I have to show him my 'activity report form,'"" Murphy told ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast. Thanks to a federal policy change taking effect in most states, unemployed people who don't have kids will no longer be allowed to have more than three months of nutrition assistance unless they work at least 20 hours a week.When it started implementing the policy last year, Wisconsin directed able-bodied adults without dependents who receive food stamps to the voluntary training program. The state is one of only five that has pledged to offer such a qualifying ""work activity"" to anyone who chooses to participate.Murphy, 41, is enrolled in the FoodShare Employment & Training program. The form she fills out every week asks her things like whether she applied for a job, what kind job it was, how far she drove, and whether she sent an email following up on her application. The time Murphy spends on these activities can be added to the 20 hours per week she has to spend either working for pay or doing an approved work-like activity. Murphy said she's of two minds about the program. ""I find it just a little bit demeaning because it's almost like, 'We don't trust you to be doing what you say you're doing, so you have to give us proof of it, and then we'll decide if we believe you or not,'"" she said.""I can understand, on the one hand, where they're coming from because they really don't want people abusing the system and just staying at home,"" she continued. ""But those of us who are actively looking for a job, to have to be on government assistance and be treated like we're wasting the taxpayer's money, is kind of rude.""Roughly 18,000 Wisconsinites have enrolled in the program since April, according to the latest state data, and 4,500 enrollees have since become employed. At least 15,000 Wisconsin residents had stopped receiving benefits as of early December. ""Governor Walker has invested over $50 million combined in his last two budgets to support FSET and these training efforts,"" Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick said in an email. ""These reforms are part of our focus on moving people from government dependence to true independence and ensuring they are workforce ready. ""Murphy said she has worked in retail for the past several years, usually for about 20 or 30 hours per month. She lost her last job, at a store that sells pet food and accessories, after breaking her wrist in August and missing three months of work. Summit Lake isn't a major metropolitan area, so similar retail positions are not widely available. Murphy said she hopes meetings with a career counselor -- another requirement of the FoodShare training program -- can help point her in a new direction. She certainly doesn't want to lose the roughly $150 in monthly food assistance. She said she already leads a no-frills lifestyle. ""I can't afford to go to the movies. I don't go out to eat,"" she said. ""If I want new clothes, I go to Goodwill."" "

Canty originally crossed the border into British Columbia in September as a tourist, then opted to stay and apply for refugee status.Ron Yamauchi, an IRB board member who wrote the decision, acknowledged that black people in the U.S. are “stopped and questioned by police at the highest rate compared to other racial groups,” the CBC reported. But the decision argued that Canty personally did not have a “well-founded” fear of persecution in his home country.""His removal to the United States of America would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment,” the decision read.At his October hearing, Canty argued that black people in the U.S. are “being exterminated at an alarming rate” and said he feared for his life. He cited high-profile cases like the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner as evidence.Canty faces criminal charges in multiple states for misdemeanors including jaywalking, threats and intimidation, trespassing and disorderly conduct, according to reports. But Canty told Vice in October that these charges are false -- the result of police targeting him because of his race.He told Vice in an email this week that he won’t be appealing the decision because he has become disillusioned with the Canadian government.

Did you notice the media forgot all about another story's basic facts? Tweet @TheWorldPost or let us know on our Facebook page.U.S. officials finally confirmed this week that an American drone base in Ethiopia was closed in September, after being used for four years to help gather intelligence on Somalia-based extremist group al-Shabaab.The revelation comes after news in December that the U.S. military had deactivated a drone squad in neighboring Djibouti. Some commentators saw the closures as a sign that U.S. drone resources are shifting away from East Africa, specifically the battlefields of Somalia and, a short flight away over the Gulf of Aden, Yemen. But that doesn’t mean the U.S. drone wars there will end. The U.S. has a wide network of bases across Africa -- it is still flying drones from Chabelley Airfield in Djibouti, for example. Investigative journalist Nick Turse, who runs the site Tom Dispatch, has counted at least 60 U.S. bases and other facilities across the continent. “While the U.S. has shifted Predator and Reaper drones away from the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula, this does not mean strikes are going to stop in either place,” Jack Serle, a reporter at the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, told The WorldPost by email. The journalism group, which tracks reports of U.S. drone strikes, said Thursday that reported strikes increased in both Somalia and Yemen last year.Some Africa experts argued that the U.S. drone program has run its course in Somalia. U.S. drone strikes killed al-Shabaab's leader, Ahmed Godane, in 2014, and possibly also his replacement, Abu Ubaidah, in December 2015. A counter-insurgency campaign backed by U.S. strikes has loosened some of al-Shabaab's territorial hold on South Somalia. According to J. Peter Pham, director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, these successes show that the U.S. drone program at Arba Minch ""has served its purpose.""""Now the question is whether the Somali government is capable of governing this space,"" Pham said.Yet the conflict in Somalia is far from over. Somalia's government has been unable to stop the al-Shabaab attacks on the capital, or to follow through on a promise to hold elections. And the U.S. remains deeply engaged in the Somali conflict, including reportedly establishing bases inside the country. “In Somalia, the U.S. has a much larger presence on the ground than one might think,"" Serle said. ""The U.S. is not going to denude these folks of drone coverage while they're in harm's way.”U.S. bases in East Africa also have been reportedly used to fly drones over Yemen.There, reported U.S. drone strikes have targeted al Qaeda's branch in the country -- Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. Last year, the extremist group consolidated power in the Yemeni city of Mukalla as the country unravelled into civil war, and a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against the Houthi rebel group. U.S. drone strikes, in turn, were concentrated on Mukalla in 2015, while in previous years they hit targets across the country, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.""With a smaller area, and an area that is a known AQAP hot spot, perhaps the U.S. won't need as many drones as it did before,"" Serle said. But with ""the current civil war and breakdown of the Yemeni state, the space is there for AQAP to flourish again, which the U.S. would see as a serious threat.”Meanwhile, other threats are brewing in North Africa and West Africa, as well as in the Middle East, forcing a redistribution of American resources.“While Yemen and Somalia remain priorities for the U.S., the demands for drones in the rest of Africa, Middle East and Asia mean the U.S. resources are being redeployed and reallocated,"" Serle said.In October, shortly after the closure of Arba Minch, President Barack Obama announced that U.S. troops would set up a new drone base in Cameroon to help fight Nigeria-based extremist group Boko Haram.The U.S. was also looking last summer for a home for a new drone base in North Africa to help monitor the Islamic State's branch in Libya, The Wall Street Journal reported.

35,THE WORLDPOST,How The Latest Saudi-Iran Feud Will Impact The Entire Middle East,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-iran-relations-feud_us_568ebf91e4b0cad15e63edb0,An expert interview with Professor Mohamad Bazzi.,2016-01-09,"Supporters of Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr, who was executed in Saudi Arabia, demonstrate in front of the Saudi Arabian embassy in Yemen on Jan. 7. The cleric's death led to a major breakdown in diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568ed7a21a00002c005941a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with New York University Professor Mohamad Bazzi about the Saudi-Iran rift.On the second day of 2016, Saudi Arabia killed 47 prisoners in a series of executions across the kingdom. Prominent Shiite cleric and dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr was among those executed, and after news broke of his death, a group of demonstrators stormed the Saudi embassy in Iran's capital in protest. Saudi Arabia responded this week by cutting off diplomatic ties with Iran, worsening already hostile relations between the two powers.The escalating rift between predominantly Sunni Saudi Arabia and mostly Shiite Iran now threatens to increase sectarian tensions, as well as make conflicts in the region even more convoluted and intractable. The WorldPost spoke with New York University Professor Mohamad Bazzi, who is currently working on a book about Iranian-Saudi relations, about what caused this most recent spat between the two states and what it means for the Middle East. Bazzi has also recently written a blog for Reuters on the latest developments in Iranian-Saudi relations.Why do you think Saudi Arabia decided to initiate this latest escalation with the execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr?Well there’s several layers to this, beginning with domestic factors and then extending to the Saudi-Iran rivalry.Many of the people who were executed had been in Saudi prisons for years, and the core group of people were associated with al Qaeda and had been responsible for a series of attacks in 2003 and 2004.That was 43 of the 47 people?Yes, the breakdown was 43 Sunnis and 4 Shiites, which interestingly corresponds to the proportion of Shiites in the Saudi population. The message that the Saudis wanted to send was that dissent won’t be tolerated, whether it’s Sunnis or Shiites. The Saudi regime, at first, seemed like they were concerned with the domestic ramifications of the execution. They were worried that if they had only executed Sunnis, it might lead to protest and a backlash within the Sunni community in Saudi Arabia, which is their constituency.That seemed to be the initial Saudi calculation, to balance out the execution and to divert tension that they were executing so many al Qaeda prisoners.It is also a projection of strength from the new king, Salman, because the death sentence against Sheikh Nimr was handed down under former King Abdullah, and the international expectation seemed to be that it wouldn’t be carried out.Those are the domestic, internal calculations. In terms of international calculations, Saudi Arabia has been worried about Iran for quite a while, but especially since the nuclear deal over summer.Did the perception that the U.S. is normalizing ties with Iran, or that Iran is going to have a larger influence in the region following the nuclear deal, play into the decision to execute Nimr?Well the Saudis have just been dismayed since the nuclear deal. The Saudis have been worried that this will open a path towards normalization between Iran and the West, especially the United States.The Saudi regime seems to believe that if the U.S. opens up to Iran, then somehow that would mean the U.S. abandoning Saudi Arabia and its traditional Sunni-Arab allies in the gulf. That’s because the Saudi-Iran rivalry has become a zero-sum game in so many ways.The Saudis and the Iranians have begun to think that if one country gains in the region or makes inroads with Western powers, it has to come at the expense of the other.So the Saudis have been trying to find a way to undermine the nuclear agreement, and to keep Iran from going down this path of normalization with the West.In terms of the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, what impact will this recent deterioration between Iran and Saudi Arabia have?The wars in Syria and Yemen can’t be stopped without an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. And now with those two powers refusing to speak to each other, the violence is likely to get worse.We’ve seen that already with Yemen. As this crisis was unfolding, the Saudis announced that they were abandoning the ceasefire -- which hadn’t entirely taken hold anyway -- and on Tuesday there were reports that there was a much more intense bombardment of areas by the Saudis.In Syria, it’s a bit more complicated because the Saudis that aren’t involved directly. But we do have the peace talks scheduled for January 25, and the already dim prospects for those are now much dimmer.What do you think it would take for Saudi-Iran relations to improve?Some Saudi officials were asked a similar question a few days ago, and their response was that Iran has to stop meddling in the affairs of Arab countries, as they put it.Of course, they never said that they would stop meddling in the affairs of Arab countries, they seem to see that as their right, seeing themselves as the leader of the Arab world and the Muslim world. And [Iranian President] Rouhani made a similar statement about the Saudis not meddling in regional affairs as well.Right, and that’s not going to happen. Neither Saudi nor Iran are going to stop meddling in the affairs of the region, they’re not going to stop supporting proxies and allies in different countries, whether it’s Yemen, Syria, Lebanon. So, that’s not going to happen, and it’s hard to see a way out of this in the short term. Unless there is a significant breakthrough on Syria, that could bring some confidence. That would entail really effective maneuvering by Russia and the United States.In the short term, we’re also going to see the Saudis try more ways to isolate Iran again following the nuclear deal. What’s something that you think gets missed in the media when it comes to Saudi-Iranian relations?Often overlooked is that this conflict is partly rooted in the historical Sunni-Shiite schism, but for the most part it’s a struggle for political dominance of the Middle East.Saudi Arabia and Iran both have a lot of experience using sectarianism to instigate people in the region, and to play different factions off one another, but most of the time it’s for political ends.It’s a classic struggle for influence, and it’s not a naturally occurring phenomenon of ancient hatreds between Sunni and Shiites. The history is there and the hatreds are there, but the sectarian sentiment is often deployed by these states a part of a power game.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series:Also on HuffPost:"

That dude clearly never mentioned Professor Snape on Twitter.When J.K. Rowling opened up last year about the reason Harry Potter named one of his sons after the Potions master, it basically started another Battle of Hogwarts online. Both Snape-haters and Severus-supporters were throwing Unforgivable Curses left and right. This Saturday is Snape's birthday, and Rowling -- clearly not wanting to stir up another Vampyr Mosps' nest of controversy -- devised a pretty magical solution:Ten points to Rowling for the most diplomatic statement ever!Judging by the subsequent Twitter buzz, both Snape haters and supports alike are loving it. Yeah, there are still a couple Death Eaters in the bunch saying stuff like ""Explain the 'best' part"" -- but hey, someone's got to be sorted into Slytherin, right?At least now we can all feel confident saying: ""Happy birthday, Snape! Hope you have the greatest/worst day ever.""Also on HuffPost:"

Jackson.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56911e841a00002d005942fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Looks like Han Solo can finally pay off his debts.Harrison Ford, who gained worldwide fame as the roguish smuggler in the ""Star Wars"" series, has officially grossed more at the U.S. box office than any other actor in history. He's earned a whopping $4.71 billion, according to Box Office Mojo.The insane numbers raked in by J.J. Abrams' ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" probably have something to do with Ford taking the top spot -- although we can't overlook his many other successful films and franchises, like ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Air Force One."" Ford nabs the top box-office spot from his fellow ""Star Wars"" actor Samuel L. Jackson, who appeared in all three of the prequel films released between 1999 and 2005, and who has also appeared in seven films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. Jackson's number sits only slightly lower than Ford's at $4.63 billion.Tom Hanks comes in at number three with $4.33 billion, while the voice of God Morgan Freeman ($4.32 billion) and Eddie Murphy ($3.81 billion) round out the top five. The first woman to appear on the list is Cameron Diaz, who takes the 15th spot with $3.03 billion, followed by Cate Blanchett ($2.79 billion) and Helena Bonham Carter ($2.74 billion) in the 24th and 25th spots respectively.
