4,BUSINESS,The Obama Administration Could Repeat Its Biggest Mistake Of The Financial Crisis,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/department-of-justice-volkswagen_us_568ad0b8e4b06fa688831b99,The government has vowed to punish executives for corporate wrongdoing. Will it follow through?,2016-01-06,Protesters demonstrate outside a Wells Fargo Bank shareholders' meeting to make the point that no executives were jailed after the financial crisis.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568d9a6d190000c90178b417.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the years since it failed to prosecute a single Wall Street executive involved in the global financial crisis, the U.S. Department of Justice has repeatedly promised to hold corporate executives liable for wrongdoing. But on Monday, when it sued Volkwagen over the automaker's scheme to disguise the illegally high amounts of poisonous gases its cars were spewing into the air, the DOJ brought no criminal charges against the company or its employees.The German automaker, one of the largest in the world, admitted on Sept. 22 to installing software meant to cheat on emissions tests in 11 million of its diesel vehicles. Prosecutors allege the company attempted to scam the public and deliberately hid this fact from regulators, obstructed investigators, and lied to federal authorities.By suing Volkswagen but not pursuing criminal cases against the company or its employees, the Justice Department is repeating the mistakes it made in the wake of the financial crisis, consumer advocates argue. In the years after the meltdown, several big banks effectively bought their way out of criminal charges by agreeing to pay billions of dollars to government agencies and aggrieved households. And despite widespread fraud, no top bankers were prosecuted.Obama administration officials have repeatedly promised that kind of impunity won't continue.""Americans should never believe, even incorrectly, that one’s criminal activity will go unpunished simply because it was committed on behalf of a corporation,"" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said on Sept. 10, a day after she sent a memo to federal prosecutors nationwide instructing them to pursue corporate executives. ""If the citizens of this country don’t have confidence that the criminal justice system operates fairly and applies equally -- regardless of who commits the crime or where it is committed -- then we’re in trouble.""The case against Volkswagen ""is a perfect opportunity for the Justice Department to live up to its word,"" said Mike Litt, who works on consumer issues for U.S. PIRG, the Federation of State Public Interest Research Groups.The allegations against Volkwagen are ""truly heinous,"" said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a Washington-based advocacy group. In its civil complaint against Volkswagen, the Justice Department accused the company of ""knowingly"" concealing from federal regulators that it had installed software designed to cheat emissions tests in about 580,000 of its diesel cars sold in the U.S. The automaker also ""impeded and obstructed"" regulators' efforts for about a year to learn about the ""defeat device"" that allowed the company to cheat the emissions tests, according to the complaint.The Environmental Protection Agency and California's environment watchdog began investigating the company around May 2014. In the ensuing months, Volkswagen repeatedly blamed the unusually low emissions readings from its cars on ""technical issues."" It wasn't until September of last year that the company admitted it had cheated on the emissions tests, according to the complaint.Federal prosecutors cited congressional testimony by Michael Horn, chief executive of the automaker's U.S. division, to allege that the company made false statements to state and federal environmental regulators. The Justice Department also used Horn's testimony to allege that Volkswagen's installation of the defeat device in some of its vehicles was a ""knowing and willful decision to deceive.""Volkswagen's deception will kill people and cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars. Nearly 600,000 Volkswagens sold in the U.S. officially met government standards during testing but on the road emitted nitrogen oxides at rates up to 40 times the legal limit. The gases those cars have already emitted in the U.S. could lead to about 60 early deaths and $450 million in health-related costs, researchers from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimated in a study released in October. Those numbers will only increase: If the company doesn't recall the affected vehicles by the end of 2016, their excess emissions will cause another 140 early deaths and $910 million in health costs.U.S. authorities and Volkswagen have yet to agree on the terms of a recall, said Cynthia Giles, who leads the EPA’s enforcement division. Volkswagen declined to make any executives available to discuss the civil complaint or the lack of criminal charges. “We will continue to cooperate with all government agencies investigating these matters,"" Volkswagen spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said.Because of the seriousness of the allegations, ""justice demands a sharp break from the kid-glove, coddling treatment that the U.S. Department of Justice has shown to corporate criminals over the past decade,"" Public Citizen's Weismann added. ""Volkswagen must be made to plead guilty for its crimes...[and] individuals inside Volkswagen must be prosecuted and should be sent to jail.""But it's only a matter of time before federal prosecutors file criminal charges against Volkswagen, say two experts -- one formerly the top environmental crime prosecutor in the country, the other a law professor who has extensively studied the Justice Department's settlements with corporations.""Criminal charges will follow this year or early next year,"" predicted David Uhlmann, a professor at the University of Michigan law school in Ann Arbor and the former chief of the DOJ's environmental crimes division.""The Justice Department has fallen down on the job in prosecuting corporate crime over the last two presidential administrations,"" Uhlmann said. ""In major case after major case [the Justice Department] has allowed companies to buy their way out of criminal liability. But that won't happen in the Volkswagen case.... It's just such an egregious case that it warrants both civil and criminal penalties.""Unlike prosecutors in the Justice Department's criminal division, those responsible for prosecuting environmental crimes have long believed that ""corporations that engage in criminal activity should plead guilty or be convicted at trial, and should not be allowed to escape criminal prosecution by paying large non-criminal penalties,"" Uhlmann added.Uhlmann and Brandon Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia law school and author of the book Too Big to Jail, listed several likely reasons why the Justice Department first pursued civil claims against Volkswagen rather than criminal charges:The Clean Air Act precludes the federal government from seeking criminal penalties against automakers that violate the law by installing defeat devices, Uhlmann said. The civil suit is ""the only way for the Justice Department to address the pollution that has occurred as a result of Volkswagen's misconduct,"" he explained. ""The lying and the fraud is a different matter [which] the government will address with a criminal lawsuit.""Criminal charges against Volkswagen and its employees are still a possibility, Wyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesman, suggested to HuffPost.""A civil complaint does not preclude the government from seeking other legal remedies,"" he noted. ""The United States' investigation is continuing and will follow the facts and evidence wherever they lead.""But the DOJ's critics are unconvinced. Federal prosecutors, Weismann said, ""don't have a record that merits giving them the benefit of the doubt."""
5,COLLEGE,"Forget Pundits, This Is What People On Yik Yak Say About Obama's Gun Control Action",Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-gun-control-yik-yak_us_568c4929e4b0cad15e6267be,These posts on an app popular on college campuses provide a glimpse into how students feel about the announcement.,2016-01-06,The reaction by people on college campuses using Yik Yak was largely positive for President Barack Obama's gun control move.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568c89b11f0000c000e9d0bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Few users of Yik Yak on college campuses disapproved of President Barack Obama's executive action on gun control measures, according to an analysis by the social media platform.Yik Yak is a popular smartphone app among college students. Everyone posting to a campus's Yik Yak feed is anonymous, but because of the geolocation restriction, only those on or very close to the school's property can post in the mobile forum. Just 18 percent of all comments about Obama's gun control measures posted between 12 noon and 8 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday were ""disapproving,"" an analysis by Yik Yak for The Huffington Post found, while 30 percent were neutral.Yik Yak's analysis showed 52 percent of the ""yaks,"" as the posts are called, were ""approving."" Five percent of those thought Obama's policy was the right thing, but wished it hadn't been done as an executive order.Close to half -- 46 percent -- of those who disapproved of Obama's gun control action did so because they appeared to be ""anti-Obama/liberals/the liberal agenda,"" according to Yik Yak. A quarter of the 18 percent who disapproved said they opposed a perceived encroachment on the Second Amendment. Posts reviewed by HuffPost showed reactions ranged from illicit anger to nuanced policy discussions, as well as jokes about the politics of the issue. In fact, some of the posts classified as ""disapproving"" could be considered satire, such as the example from Ohio State University seen below.However, a Yik Yak representative said what they've seen is that many of the disapproving posts were not as light in tone. Many also tended to sit very low on the feed, Yik Yak said, meaning that people were not ""upvoting"" the posts to express approval.Obama's executive action will shrink what's called a ""gun show loophole,"" by narrowing what kind of people selling firearms do not need to conduct a background check. The president is also pushing for more mental health funding, which would require congressional approval. While Yik Yak users don’t represent American college students as a whole, the analysis provides a glimpse into how some students feel about the announcement.A Pew Research Center poll from August found 84 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 supported background checks at gun shows. People who were more highly educated were more likely to support this and other gun control proposals.A selection of posts on Yik Yak about Obama's gun control action (some with explicit language) are displayed below:______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and is based in New York.

Paul Ryan said in 2013 it sounded like a ""reasonable"" idea to close the gun show loophole. He seems to have forgotten that.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5858aa361c000011070ec89b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) criticized President Barack Obama on Monday for planning to use his executive authority to implement gun control measures.But take Obama out of the equation, and Ryan is just fine with tighter background checks on gun sales -- the very thing Obama is expected to focus on -- and with a president taking executive actions on major policy issues.While it's not clear what specific actions the president will take this week, he will reportedly require more gun sellers to conduct background checks at gun shows. This would at least narrow a loophole in federal law that allows private sales of firearms at shows without background checks.Ryan dismissed that idea Monday, saying it wouldn't have stopped the mass shootings that have plagued the nation.""We all are pained by the recent atrocities in our country, but no change the president is reportedly considering would have prevented them,"" the speaker said in a statement. ""We have seen consistently that an underlying cause of these attacks has been mental illness, and we should look at ways to address this problem.""That's a stark contrast to where Ryan stood in January 2013, when he called the notion of closing the gun show loophole ""reasonable"" and ""obvious.""""I think we need to find out how to close these loopholes and do it in such a way that we don't infringe upon people's Second Amendment rights,"" he said in an interview with the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.""We had this issue, 2001, 1999 I think … when I first got into Congress,"" Ryan continued. ""At the time I remember thinking, 'You know, there is a loophole here. We should address that.'"" See a video of that interview:Despite those earlier comments, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong told The Huffington Post on Monday that he ""has never supported"" what Obama is proposing. She said he wants the president to focus on enforcing current laws instead of ""intruding further into people's lives.""Beyond specific gun control proposals, Ryan also took issue Monday with the fact that Obama is bypassing Congress to address gun violence.""While we don't yet know the details of the plan, the president is at minimum subverting the legislative branch, and potentially overturning its will,"" he said. ""This is a dangerous level of executive overreach, and the country will not stand for it.""But back when he was Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate, Ryan thought the idea of a president using his executive authority to make big policy changes sounded great. Ryan told attendees at a September 2012 campaign event that if elected, Romney would repeal Obama's signature health care law through an executive order, since the Senate votes weren't there to repeal it through Congress.""The answer is yes, on day one, Mitt Romney's going to send an executive order granting those waivers"" to get rid of the law, Ryan said. ""We are going to repeal and replace this entire law.""Strong said there's no inconsistency in Ryan's comments on executive authority.""The speaker has never said he's against all executive action,"" she said.Also on HuffPost:"

Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) on Tuesday introduced a resolution calling on Congress to officially condemn ""the unlawful, armed occupation"" of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.""This is not a romantic instance of Western self-reliance or an excusable moment of heated rhetoric,"" Grijalva said in a statement. ""This is armed occupation of public property by people who have threatened deadly force.""Approximately 20 armed occupiers took over the government building on Saturday. They are protesting that Dwight and Steven Hammond were sentenced to five years in prison for committing arson on federally managed land to which they held grazing rights.The men's family members have distanced themselves from the illegal occupation, and said any support for the family should be peaceful.The leader of the occupation is Ammon Bundy, the son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who became a conservative hero when he led an anti-government standoff with federal authorities in 2014.Speaking to the press on behalf of the group, the younger Bundy said Sunday that the group intended to resist government tyranny and was willing to stay at the wildlife refuge's headquarters indefinitely. Ryan Bundy, his brother, said they were willing ""to kill and be killed.""Grijalva's resolution highlights disruptions the occupation has caused in the local community, such as school closures and federal employees being unable to report for work.""It is imperative that this unlawful occupation does not escalate into violence,"" it reads. Some Republican presidential candidates, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have spoken against the illegal tactics employed in Oregon. Former Pennsylvania senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum compared them to those used in the Occupy Wall Street movement, which Democrats generally supported. House Natural Resources Committee Chair Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) declined Grijalva's appeal to sign on to his resolution, according to a Grijalva spokesman.Bishop's office did not respond to a request for comment.In 2014, Cliven Bundy refused to pay federal officials who arrived at his home to collect an estimated $1 million in grazing fees.

It’s been nearly six decades since we’ve seen two teams this good play a game that was that great. Other things that happened in 1957: The first Frisbee was invented, the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers agreed to haul the team to Los Angeles and the Soviet Union sent Sputnik into space. 2. Oklahoma’s Buddy Hield spun, skipped and sliced his way to 46 points, going 8-of-15 from deep. The guy was lights-out from long-range -- hitting this pump-fake, one-dribble, hand-in-the-face triple in the contest’s third overtime … … while he also showed off his agility, gliding and contorting his way through the paint and to the basket for this lay-in, only a few minutes earlier. 3. We saw a 20-point momentum swing in just about five minutes of game time. With 3:03 remaining in the first half, a Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk 3-pointer gave Kansas the 37-26 lead. Right after intermission, with 17:53 to go in regulation, a Khadeem Lattin dunk capped off a huge Sooners run, pushing the visiting team to a 51-42 advantage.4. It took this contested, falling-to-the-floor trey to break the contest’s stalemate and give Kansas an edge in the final stanza. Wayne Selden Jr. finished with 21 points, shooting 9-of-17 on the night, including another clutch basket with 75 seconds left in the battle.By the way, this second-half slam wasn’t half bad, either.5. Each team was killer from 3-point range, shooting at a combined clip of 49.25 percent -- but, at the end of the day, the cliché rang true: Defense won the game for Kansas.Frank Mason III tallied two steals in the final 21 seconds, giving the Jayhawks a pair of extra possessions that enabled the home team to tie the contest, take the lead and ultimately clinch the win.More Jayhawks-Sooners matchups, please.Also on HuffPost:"
9,MEDIA,Donald Trump Shouldn't Have Bothered Buying Airtime. Cable News Ran His Ad 60 Times For Free.,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-cable-news-airtime_us_568c0d96e4b014efe0dbe5a4,"Fox, MSNBC and CNN seemingly played it on loop over 24 hours.",2016-01-05,"Trump has dominated 2016 coverage through mix of celebrity, accessibility, and outrage. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Donald Trump doesn't need to buy media exposure. Television networks have given Trump the most attention this election cycle due to a unique mix of celebrity, accessibility, front-runner status and propensity for making outrageous and offensive remarks. But Trump, claiming his campaign is $35 million under budget, pledged last week to spend $2 million a week on ads, with the campaign on Monday placing its first order for spots in Iowa and New Hampshire. Before early state voters stumbled across Trump's ad on local stations, national news networks had already broadcast it dozens of times, beginning at 5:30 a.m. Monday. Over the next 24 hours, Fox, MSNBC and CNN ran the ad 60 times, according to a HuffPost tally using monitoring service TVEyes. Networks most commonly played the ad in full, though the tally includes partial airings in news segments.Campaign ads can have news value, especially if they're provocative or a first of some kind. The ominous Trump ad, which highlighted his anti-Muslim stance, checked off both boxes. The ad also sparked controversy for implying that footage of people running across a ""southern border"" were heading from Mexico to the United States, when in fact, they were thousands of miles away in Morocco. Still, the ubiquity of the ad across cable news during a 24-hour period demonstrated Trump's unmatched ability to generate free publicity. When Fox News covered the ad during the 6 p.m. hour, correspondent Carl Cameron noted it had ""already received countless airings"" on TV networks.  And beyond cable news, the ad ran Monday on top network morning shows, evening news casts, and even as a punchline on late-night TV.ABC's Jimmy Kimmel joked Monday night that Trump released the ad as ""part of his New Year's resolution to be on TV more in 2016."" Later, NBC's Seth Myers remarked that Trump's paid ad blitz comes ""on top of the free advertising Trump has been getting from TV networks for months.""Elizabeth Wilner, senior vice president at Kantar Media Intelligence, a company that tracks political ad spending, told HuffPost that Trump had run circles around the rest of the presidential pack in generating free media, which she estimated to be worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars. She noted Trump previously garnered an unprecedented amount of national media coverage in November for simply making a radio ad buy. “When do you ever see that much attention given to radio advertising in general? Never,” Wilner said. “Everything he does gets incredible coverage."" "

It obviously isn't a perfect method for one major reason: It's impossible to determine why anyone's searching for a given term. A gun owner could be brushing up on ""gun control"" to further his or her pro-gun arguments, while gun control advocates might want to learn about ""gun shops"" in their area. Still, it's a useful way to get a broad view of where the American public stands -- and when opinions seem to shift.In 2015 overall, states were overwhelmingly more interested in learning about ""gun shops"" than ""gun control.""The only states that averaged more searches for ""gun control"" throughout the year were California, Utah, Alaska, Washington, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island.""Gun shop"" has been a more popular term in the United States overall for the past few years.Meanwhile, guns kill an average of 36 people every day in the U.S. According to the Gun Violence Archive, 127 people have already been killed in gun incidents in 2016."

The Telegraph found Lego sets in “pristine condition” have risen 12 percent in value by 12 percent each year since 2000. Gold investors have seen an annual gain of 9.6 percent over that period and the S&P 500 4.2 percent.Some of the most valuable toy sets have increased tenfold on secondary markets like eBay since they were first released. Café Corner, which came out in 2007, is now worth around $3,100, or over 20 times its original price. Star Wars items continue to sell for thousands of dollars, with the 5,000-piece Ultimate Collector’s Millennium Falcon set from 2007 now worth over $4,000.Lego’s profits have soared in recent years -- and its revenue growth is regularly beating those of its rivals Mattel and Hasbro. Demand has been so high that the company has had trouble in recent months fulfilling orders. And it’s made strategic partnerships with Hollywood franchises, like Star Wars and Harry Potter, to ensure its dominance in the toy industry.All of this is just another reason to love Legos. The company has taken a lead on sustainability, announcing last June that it would spend $150 million over the next 15 years to develop new environmentally friendly materials that would replace its traditional plastic blocks. Lego’s plant in Denmark currently produces over 70 million bricks a day. The company also opened a wind farm in Germany in October and aims to be fully renewable by 2020.Lego has been recognized as one of the early proponents of gender-neutral toys, but the company has released pink versions of its sets for girls and most of its character figurines and users are male. In 2012, the company received criticism for its Lego Friends line, which was marketed specifically to girls. In response to growing demand, however, Lego has started to introduce more female minifigures to its collection, like a paleontologist, an aerospace engineer, an astronaut and others in STEM fields.Also on HuffPost:"

The militants, led by the sons of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, have occupied the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge since Saturday, when they broke off from a protest over the prison sentences of two local ranchers, Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven. The Hammonds were convicted of arson, imprisoned, released, and given new, harsher sentences last year. On Monday, they turned themselves in to a federal correctional facility in California. ""I want to talk directly to the people at the wildlife refuge,"" Harney County Sheriff David Ward told reporters assembled at a junior high school in Burns, Oregon. ""You said you were here to help the citizens of Harney County. That help ended when a peaceful protest became an armed occupation.""""It's time for you to leave our community, go home to your families, and end this peacefully,"" he added.Law enforcement officials have stayed far away from the wildlife refuge that the militants are occupying. The FBI is working closely with state police, but federal authorities have no immediate plans to rush in to retake the property, a federal law enforcement source told The Huffington Post. Bill Fugate, a lieutenant working for the Oregon State Police, also told HuffPost that officials have not beefed up the police response. ""We haven't really changed our patrol status,"" he said.But people near the wildlife refuge remain concerned about a potential standoff. Robert McKnight, 38, who was in the parking lot of the refuge headquarters, said on Sunday that he was ""worried for these people, not law enforcement.""

""If anyone has ever earned retirement benefits, coal miners have,"" said Phil Smith, a spokesperson for the UMWA.It's hard to disagree -- being a coal miner comes with a host of inherent health risks, including black lung, heart disease, cancer and joint deterioration from working for years in confined spaces. But it seems that miners who make it to retirement may be left fighting for scraps in a declining industry.The 2010s have not been a good decade for coal. Production capacity in the United States has been declining for years, according to the Energy Information Administration, and the number of coal mines in the United States declined by more than 13 percent between 2012 and 2013, the latest year for which there is data. The details of this particular agreement are complicated because of the Patriot spinoff and its (two!) subsequent bankruptcies. But the bottom line is that retirees are going to get about half the money they were supposed to get in their health benefits fund (referred to as the Voluntary Employees Beneficial Association, or VEBA).Back in 2013, just a few years after Peabody spun off Patriot Coal, the latter company filed for bankruptcy protection. As part of the bankruptcy, Patriot Coal agreed to put $145 million into a fund for its coal miner retirees, in order to pay for their health benefits. It emerged from that bankruptcy intact, but in May 2015 filed again. The second time, it was not so lucky.After Patriot Coal ceased to exist, the miners still had millions in health benefits promised to them. That's when the UMWA began to negotiate with Peabody to recover some of the money owed to the retirees.A statement released by Peabody Tuesday said that ""while Peabody has met its obligations under this agreement, Patriot breached the agreement, which left unclear Peabody’s ongoing funding requirements to the VEBA.""Regardless of their position that the situation was Patriot Coal's mess, Peabody agreed to pay $75 million -- quite a bit better than nothing, but $70 million less than the original agreement from just three years ago. ""When you thought you’d have $145 million coming and you end up with $75 million, you can’t call that a win, but you can’t call that a loss, either,"" said Smith.Peabody lost $302 million in the third quarter of 2015, and $149 million in the quarter before that.Here's the company's stock over the last 10 years: Here's the stock over the last five days: The price dropped by nearly 5 percent when the agreement with the UMWA was announced Tuesday."

Rick Snyder (R) apologized for toxic tap water in the city of Flint and accepted the resignations of multiple state officials, the U.S. Justice Department said it has opened an investigation into what went wrong. ""In an effort to address the concerns of Flint residents, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District is working closely with the EPA on the investigation into the contamination of the city of Flint's water supply,"" Gina Balaya, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan, told HuffPost on Tuesday. The Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped expose the poisoning of Flint's water, was the first to report the Justice Department investigation, highlighting it as an ""unusual step.""Last week, a task force appointed by Snyder squarely blamed the high lead levels in Flint's water on the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. The agency failed to address the water's corrosiveness after switching the city's water source to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure in 2014. At the time, Flint was under the authority of an emergency manager appointed by the state of Michigan.The new water absorbed lead from Flint's aging pipes, and researchers discovered a corresponding increase of lead levels in the bloodstreams of local children. The MDEQ continued to deny a lead poisoning problem even as evidence mounted last year. “I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened,"" Snyder said in a statement last week. In that statement, the governor also announced the resignation of MDEQ director Dan Wyant. Flint switched back to Detroit's water supply in October after high blood lead levels came to light.Snyder spokeswoman Laura Biehl said Tuesday that the governor's office would cooperate with the Justice Department. “We will cooperate fully with any requests from the U.S. Attorney’s Office as it looks into Flint’s water challenges,"" Biehl said, noting that the Snyder-appointed task force is still reviewing the water crisis. Curt Guyette, an investigative reporter with the Michigan ACLU, welcomed the news of the DOJ's investigation, saying ""it means that we're not gonna have to only rely on a panel appointed by Gov. Snyder to find out what really happened and if laws were violated.""The Environmental Protection Agency opened an investigation into Flint's water situation in November.Lead is a deadly neurotoxin, and exposure is especially dangerous for children, who may experience stunted growth, behavioral problems and permanently decreased IQs. This story has been updated to include additional details about the city's switch to the Flint River as its water source."

According to ESPN Las Vegas, Manziel missed a mandatory medical check-in with the Cleveland Browns on Sunday morning for the simple reason that he was over 2,000 miles away in Las Vegas the night before. Eyewitnesses place the reportedly disguised quarterback on the Vegas Strip on Saturday, wig and all, seemingly trying to hide from the public eye by seating himself right smack in the middle of the gaudiest place in the nation. While the image -- a blond, mustached Manziel -- has inspired, er, a creative outburst online as people try to visualize him in costume ...... the situation is less comic than it initially appears. Manziel spent over two months in a drug and alcohol rehab facility last winter, and a few unfortunate episodes this fall suggest that he may have fallen off the wagon again. All signs point to this being anything but a funny situation. Whether or not the Sin City rumors are confirmed, it’s likely that Johnny Football has suited up in a Browns uniform for the last time, as Sports Illustrated's Peter King has indicated.After a rocky two years together, it may be preferable for both parties that Cleveland and Manziel divorce; this weekend in Vegas, if true, would just be hastening the inevitable, ripping off the bandage instead of waiting for it to unstick, confirming Manziel’s imminent trade before the final down of the 2015 NFL season is played.

They have vowed to ""kill and be killed"" if necessary, but the FBI has decided to hold off on getting involved to avoid escalating the situation. ""It sounds like people looking for a reason for a showdown,” Hannity said, adding that there's “something not right” about the siege. His disapproval is a far cry from the tone he took when their father initiated a similarly high-profile battle with the government in 2014 over his right to let his cattle graze on public lands in Nevada without paying fees. Hannity led the charge at Fox News, hailing Bundy as a hero standing up to big government. The host distanced himself from Bundy's ordeal when video emerged that year showing the rancher saying “Negro” people were “better off as slaves.""“His comments are beyond repugnant to me,” Hannity said of Bundy's remarks at the time. “They are beyond despicable to me. They are beyond ignorant to me,"" he said, but added later that the government mishandled the ordeal and that he is still opposed to ""government overreach.”Also on HuffPost:"

The very thought of it makes us reach for the take-out menu without a second thought. Well, lucky for all of us it looks like those days of overcooked, inedible homemade dinners might just be behind us, if the the newest high-tech pan to reach the market, Pantelligent, lives up to its promises.Pantelligent uses Wi-Fi, a heat sensor placed in the middle of the pan and your smart phone to ensure that you never burn another meal again. You just tell it what you're cooking (via your phone) and it will let you know when the pan is hot enough to start (or if it's too hot and needs to be turned down), when it's time to flip, and when your food is ready to eat. Guys, the future is now. Watch the video below and see how it works.Pretty cool, we know. There are a few downsides to this pan. One, it's pricey ($199). And two, it's on backorder.

So far, 22 of the state parties linked to the Hillary Victory Fund have received $938,500 from the fund and sent the same amount back to the DNC, according to available campaign finance records. The Clinton campaign claims to have raised an additional $18 million for the party committees in the final three months of 2015, although records will not be disclosed until Jan. 31.The movement of money from a joint fundraising committee through state parties and to the national party committee has been criticized by campaign finance reformers as a way to get around campaign contribution limits.Here’s how it works: Donors are limited by how much they can give to campaign committees, national party committees and state party committees. A single donor can give $5,400 to a candidate’s campaign to cover both a primary and general election, $33,400 annually to a national party committee’s general fund and $10,000 annually to each state party. These limits are known as “base” contribution limits. (Additionally, donors can give $100,200 annually to each of the national party committee’s convention, building and legal funds thanks to a provision slipped into the 2014 omnibus budget bill.)Since the Hillary Victory Fund links the Clinton campaign, the DNC and 33 state parties, the total amount a donor could give is $669,400 per year. Technically, a maximum contribution to the fund would include $330,000 to be split among the 33 state parties. Since party committees are allowed to make unlimited transfers between each other, that money can easily be sent to the state parties most advantageous to the candidate raising the money -- in a swing state, for example. Or, as is happening with the Hillary Victory Fund, that money can be sent to the DNC, which redistributes it as they see fit.Wealthy donors like Fred Eychaner, M.K. and J.B. Pritzker and Donald Sussman have seen their six-figure contributions to the Hillary Victory Fund split into $33,400 contributions to the DNC and $10,000 to a variety of state parties. The state parties have then sent the exact amounts received from Hillary Victory Fund donors directly to the DNC. This arrangement was first reported by the Alaska Dispatch News.Clinton is not the only Democratic presidential candidate with a joint fundraising committee linked to the DNC. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has one that just raises money for the DNC, but not state parties. The DNC offered these joint fundraising agreements to the candidates in an effort to capitalize on popular figures who could help build the party's war chest. Only Clinton accepted an agreement that included state parties.Eric Walker, a spokesman for the DNC, said that the joint fundraising committees are designed to build a stronger party and that the money will go to certain states for staffing and other purposes.""The money raised through our [joint fundraising agreements] with the campaigns will be used for general election efforts up and down the ballot, and will include investments in data, technology, and our voter file, which are all used by the state parties and our candidates across the country,"" Walker said.Many of the state parties linked to the Hillary Victory Fund and transferring that money to the DNC said the same thing.“Like dozens of state parties across the country, we signed the joint fundraising agreement to help the Democratic Party fund things like research, communications and party infrastructure that will help Democrats up and down the ballot,” said Lizzy Price, communications director for the New Hampshire Democratic Party.“The [Democratic Party of Virginia] relies on the DNC for many valuable services like help with research, press, technology, and even transfers money to help fund staff,” said Stephen Carter, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Virginia. “A well funded DNC is in the best interest of every Democrat in America.”Rachel Irwin, spokeswoman for the Maine Democratic Party, said, “Our hope is that these joint fundraising agreements will help us bolster our party at the state and national level to help elect Democrats up and down the ticket in 2016.”The money will help the DNC maintain its voter file and other databases used by all state parties. In the end, though, the DNC will decide which state parties will see an infusion of this cash during the election cycle based on need for the presidential nominee and other down-ballot races.The ability of a single candidate to raise huge sums through a joint fundraising committee and spread it around to dozens of party committees was made possible by the Supreme Court’s 2014 ruling in the McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission case that overturned aggregate campaign contribution limits. Prior to the court’s 5-4 ruling, individual donors were limited to giving $123,000 in overall contributions to campaigns, parties and political action committees in each two-year election cycle. (Unlimited super PAC contributions did not factor into this aggregate limit.) These limits were meant as a defense against the subversion of the base contribution limits, as money could be moved between party committees or PACs to allow a donor to give more than their limit to a single candidate or party committee.Conservative opponents of campaign finance regulation on the court saw this argument as unsupported by any evidence. Alito called it a “wild hypothetical” that a joint fundraising committee would be used to raise huge sums by one candidate and then have the money directed back into one committee.“Now, how -- how realistic is that?” Alito said in October 2013, during arguments in McCutcheon v. FEC. “How realistic is it that all of the state party committees, for example, are going to get money and they're all going to transfer it to one candidate?""Chief Justice John Roberts, the author of the McCutcheon decision, also stated that these arguments -- along with others made by supporters of the limits -- were “divorced from reality.”While the movement of money by the Hillary Victory Fund and its connected Democratic state parties proves Roberts and Alito wrong, the justices' claims could have been disproven at the time by already existing evidence of joint fundraising committees and intraparty transfers used to get around base contribution limits.As previously reported by The Huffington Post, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s campaign employed a joint fundraising committee linked to four state parties in 2012. The funds directed to those four party committees were then redirected to swing-state party committees, often with funds from donors who had already given the maximum to those swing-state parties.Similarly, joint fundraising committees connected to former Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and 2012 Senate candidate Josh Mandel (R-Ohio) included both state and local party committees. These local committees promptly transferred their portion of the funds raised to the state party committees.These arrangements were made while aggregate limits still existed. The contributions flowing through the Hillary Victory Fund show how much more money can be moved now that the Supreme Court has eliminated them."

But a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports on Monday reveals exactly how the small creature makes up in powerful tongue speed what it lacks in size.For the study, Brown University biologist Christopher Anderson and his team surveyed 20 chameleon species of varying sizes in an attempt to find the upper limit of chameleon tongue performance.Research shows that a chameleon's secret weapon is its ability to ""pre-load"" large amounts of energy into the tongue's elastic tissue, and this stored energy augments the muscle power used to fling the tongue. And while all chameleons have the same catapult-like apparatus for launching the tongue, smaller chameleons have ones that are larger proportional to their size.“Smaller species have higher performance than larger species,” Anderson said in a statement. He compared the smaller species to ""little sports cars with relatively powerful engines.""The researchers concluded that it's an evolutionary trait that can be explained by a smaller animal's need to ""consume more energy per body weight"" in order to survive. Just check out the Trioceros hoehnelii -- one of the chameleon species used in the study -- below.With a peak acceleration 264 times greater than the force of gravity, the rosette-nosed chameleon's tongue has the ""highest acceleration and power output produced per kilogram of muscle mass by any reptile, bird, or mammal"" -- second only to a salamander, which has the most powerful tongue of all vertebrates, according to the researchers. And just think, all the chameleon has to do is say ""Ahhh!""Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who have steadily advanced the once-marginal pro-expansion stance into the mainstream.“Hurray for the Times! I just wish The Washington Post were as enlightened,” said Nancy Altman, founding co-director of Social Security Works, a nonprofit that convenes a coalition of groups fighting for benefits expansion.Dean Baker, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and a critic of how the press sometimes covers the Social Security debate, underscored the Times’ role as an arbiter of mainstream liberal thought. The longtime proponent of expanding Social Security called the publication's editorial “hugely important.”“They’re very much at the center of respectable opinion,"" he said. ""If you’re taking a position that they have taken, you’re not considered a nut.”And “nuts” is what many respectable Washington opinion leaders would have called the position even a few years ago. The Washington Post referred to groups opposed to benefit cuts -- ones that didn't even go so far as to suggest expanding Social Security -- as “Social Security denialists” in an August 2010 editorial.In the deficit-wary, early days of the economic recovery, when the tea party was ascendant and President Barack Obama convened the Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission, the question among both Democrats and Republicans was largely not whether Social Security benefits should be cut, but by how much.The Bowles-Simpson commission recommended dramatic changes to the popular social insurance program in December 2010, including increasing the retirement age to 69, means-testing benefits and cutting the program’s cost-of-living adjustment by adopting a “chained” Consumer Price Index. Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), a leading Senate liberal and close ally of the president, sat on the commission, voted for its controversial recommendations and defended his vote in print.Although the commission's proposals never were considered seriously by Congress wholesale, Obama offered Republican leaders the chained CPI as a compromise during fiscal cliff negotiations in December 2012.The president subsequently included it in his fiscal year 2014 budget -- proof to many progressives that he actually believed in reducing benefits as a matter of policy.At that time, Sanders spoke to progressives protesting outside the White House who had delivered over 2.5 million signatures against the move. The Times, for its part, also condemned the chained CPI, while implying it remained open to some other benefit cuts.Along with the pressure from Obama’s base, the requisite Republican support for revenue increases to complete a “grand bargain” on the budget was once again not forthcoming. The administration shelved the provision the following year, which CNN called “music to liberals’ ears.”Meanwhile, a counter-offensive was brewing. Social Security Works and its allied organizations began publicly promoting an idea they long had privately supported: that Social Security should be increased in order to combat a growing retirement income gap.They were fond of citing many of the same figures the Times put forward in its weekend editorial.“Currently, 36 percent of retirees rely on Social Security for 90 percent or more of their income; over all, 65 percent of retirees rely on it for more than half of their income,” the Times noted. “The average monthly benefit hovers around $1,300.”And things are getting worse, as the Times observed and these advocates often point out. Most Americans have saved very little for retirement and access to employer-sponsored retirement plans is declining.About a month before Obama included the chained CPI in his budget for fiscal year 2014, progressives found their first champion of expansion in Congress: Former Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) introduced a bill that would have expanded benefits across the board and paid for it by lifting the cap on earnings subject to Social Security taxes.But the movement to expand benefits really gained traction when Warren gave it her rockstar imprimatur in a passionate speech on the Senate floor in November 2013. Warren’s speech was a “real gamechanger” because of her national following, said Altman, who is also a co-author of Social Security Works: Why Social Security Isn’t Going Broke and How Expanding It Will Help Us All.Support for the position only picked up from there. All but two Senate Democrats present voted for a nonbinding budget amendment Warren introduced in April advocating the “sustainable expansion” of Social Security benefits.Among the Democratic candidates, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) have both embraced across-the-board expansion of the program. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said she would “enhance” benefits for the neediest beneficiaries, but has stopped short of the expansion language adopted by her rivals.For Altman, the Times editorial is at once a sign that Social Security expansion is an idea whose time has come, and a ""big step"" that will further propel the policy into the mainstream. “It is a recognition of what has been building all around,” she said.But Altman said she will only be satisfied when Republicans begin backing expansion of benefits as well.“The next step is for Republicans to jump on this bandwagon,” she concluded. “It has historically been a bipartisan program.
