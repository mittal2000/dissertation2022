Thomas (Photo credit should read Michael B. Thomas/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d45b200000f90101d256.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tuesday, August 19, must have been like any other day for council member Dionne Flowers. She must have woken up in the morning, and casually headed to Golden Shears, the family owned beauty salon in Veronica Park, St. Louis, where she has worked for the past several years. Barbers and hairdressers, like Dionne, are an integral part of the society. They do not just take care of our hair; they are our therapists, confidants, advisors and even peacemakers. At the end of the day, we need to really trust someone with a pair of sharp blades so close to our neck and face. This is why states regulate the training and certification of licensed barbers and cosmetologists. It is crucial to preserve the bond between client and service provider. People like Dionne, a professional and a public servant, take pride in what they do. For them, it is imperative to maintain and develop professionalism as a culture. This way, they protect the fundamental reason why people agree to pay for their services: trust. On that fateful day, just a few weeks after Michael Brown's killing in Ferguson, Dionne became a witness to the shooting of yet another young black man, Kajieme Powel. The provocative, seemingly disturbed, 25-year-old stole two energy drinks and a pastry from the nearby deli. He placed them on the ground and waited for the police to arrive. With a knife clenched in his fist, he repeatedly ordered the officers to shoot him. And so they did; seconds after they arrived. This may not be much of a surprise. However, the inconceivable, unknown detail in this story is that Dionne had more training for her license as a hairdresser, than the officers who pulled the trigger for theirs. The State of Missouri has established, through its Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners, a minimum of 1500 training hours, or 3000 hours of apprenticeship, is required for certification. On the other hand, according to the website of the St. Louis County and Municipal Police Academy (SCMPA): ""Graduates of the St. Louis CMPA are [...] peace officers [...] with 916 hours of training."" These 916 hours compose a six-month, non-residential program, with no other educational prerequisite other than just a high school diploma. An earlier report by the Department of Justice, has found that the average basic police officer training in the U.S. is a jaw dropping low of 761 hours. This means that becoming a police officer often requires almost half the training than becoming a barber. Depending on the state, peace officers have different jurisdictions and power than police officers. In Missouri, however, it is the same thing.Perhaps it is only semantics, but the use of the word ""peace"", in this context, poses quite an oxymoron. The promotional video on the academy's website sets the tone from the very first seconds, of a military environment obsessed with the use of guns. It begins with cadets shooting, with the use of firearms as reoccurring theme during the entire 11 minutes. So, what is wrong with this picture?The comparison with the promotional video of the U.S. Military Academy at Westpoint is a perfect way to demonstrate how professionalism can be instilled as a culture. In less than three minutes, Westpoint's video is able to demonstrate the immense quality of the cadets it targets. It focuses on the key notions of pride, achievement, excellence, academics, leadership and selfless service. There are less than 15 seconds of actual live ammunition training or combat scenes throughout the entire video. The reason is clear. This is not what motivates the future officers. It is just part of the job. It is also very interesting to compare SCMPA's video with something more relevant, like NYPD. ""Day in the Life of an NYPD Officer"" is a sub-three-minute NYPD promotional video. In startling difference with SCMPA, NYPD's message is mainly about the relationship with the community. Instead of firearms, NYPD uses handshakes. There is no shooting involved in the video, no violence in the message. Violent force is nothing more than a subset of extremely delicate tools that a professional soldier or law enforcer needs to engage. It is not the reason why one should join. This is where the fundamental fault in the police culture of St. Louis lies. The use of guns and force define the recruiting message, by having violence as a transcending theme. Imagine how it would feel, if the promotional video of a Medical School was all about the scalpel and the students using it on corpses. These subtle details describe the target group of the academy. They also develop a distorted sense of professionalism for SCMPA's remarkably brief training. Obsession with the use of force is detrimental to the culture of any professional law enforcing body. This cancerous belief system threatens the rule of law, as society will begin to challenge the validity of authority. Peace officers should also draw their power from trust. Otherwise, the implications in a modern society can be unfathomable. This does not, most certainly, apply to most hard-working, professional police officers nation wide, who risk their lives daily. However, we have the obligation to learn from the events in Ferguson, both for the victims, as well as the officers involved. One could argue that some of them might be products of a system that has failed them because of a series of critical mistakes -- from the selection criteria to the training itself. They might also be considered victims, for having been given the elusion of competency and then asked to keep up with the complex problems around them.The situation is very unfortunate for Missouri, which is not much of a champion when it comes to peace. According to the latest US Global Peace Index report, it ranks 45 out of 50 states, in terms of levels of peace. Truth is that there is a complex web of issues responsible for Missouri's bleak record. One thing is certain; there is a desperate need for quality peace officers in St. Louis. Perhaps, there are some lessons to be learned from the three most peaceful countries in the world -- Iceland, Denmark and Austria.Iceland, which ranks 15th in the world in gun ownership per capita, had its first police killing in its history, last year. This was the officers' last resort. Despite the necessity for that shooting, the reaction of the police was still to express its grief and apologize to the relatives. They did not apologize because the officers were wrong. They did because they were truly sorry. They did because it is the humane thing to do. Only this way, could they protect the sacred bonds of trust with their society. Denmark follows the same tone in its training, with almost 20 percent of its 33-month program focusing on issues such as socially disadvantaged and marginalized groups, causal explanations of crime and prevention methods, ethnic minorities, human rights and the rule of freedom. Austria brings the level of training to a completely different level. The cadets go through a rigorous 24-month program, with one of its main thematic groups focusing on personality development. This includes an in depth understanding of Applied Psychology, Professional ethics, Communication, Conflict Management, Social Teaching and Human Rights. On the other hand, St Louis CMP Academy has no educational admission standards and spends 76 out of the 916 hours, on ""cultural diversity and interpersonal perspectives"". These two facts alone speak volumes of the degree of the problem and how far behind police training in St Louis is.One of the first political theory concepts taught at universities is Max Weber's monopoly on the use of violence. His essay, ""Politics as a Vocation,"" includes a definition for the state, which became a pivotal notion for modern democracies. According to Weber, a state is a ""human community that successfully claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory."" His concept is still accurate and necessary for the prosperity of our society. However, its implementation is completely different. In today's reality, the enforcers of such a monopolistic authority need to adapt. They cannot afford to rely on an obsolete, vague respect to authority, which only derives from the law. The source of legitimate authority for a modern state should be primarily based on trust. Anything else is a step back, towards Draconian ideals. We desperately need to cultivate trust as the central, life-giving center for our interactions between each other and our institutions. We need to trust our police at least as much as we do our barbers."

Details may differ, circumstances of their deaths may remain unknown, but the outrage that erupted after the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of the unarmed, black 18-year-old by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri, has become a rallying cry in protests over police killings across the nation. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badff3d250000320037b00b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The rest of the country may try to forget about Ferguson, which incisive commentator Chris Williams deemed ""America's selfie."" But an inspiring collective of Black activists associated with Black Lives Matter spent Labor Day weekend in Ferguson organizing and strategizing with young people from the community to ensure that Michael Brown is the last young man to be killed at the hands of police. Much has already been written about why Ferguson went down the way it did -- and what needs to change.   It's about the over-militarization of our police. And the complex racial dynamics of the town which has a majority Black population--and a white minority, which controls the politics and the police. It is also because the cops around the country behave with impunity, despite national movement-based efforts to integrate transparency and accountability into policing. It is because every 28 hours law enforcement kills another Black man. It is because Black lives are consistently dehumanized and devalued. Because the epidemic of mass imprisonment has made Black synonymous with criminal.   But there is another reason why this keeps happening.   Why after Trayvon Martin, was there Renisha McBride? And after Renisha, why was there Eric Garner?  It's because when we call for justice for these victims of race-based violence, we're calling for the criminal prosecution of their killers. And criminal prosecution alone will do nothing to shift the culture of fear, hatred and oppression that allows these race-based killings to happen over and over and over again.   That is because a criminal prosecution is not about justice, healing or repairing harm. And it's certainly not about preventing such harm from re-occurring in the future. And there's a deep, terrible, tragic irony here -- that we have to look to the very system that was an accomplice to these killings for relief -- for some facsimile of justice.   It's the criminal justice system that perpetuates the myth of Black criminality and functions as a tool of social control. It's a system that targets our neighborhoods and prohibits 13 percent of all Black men in this country from voting, from receiving public benefits, from living in public housing, from receiving aid to help them access higher education. It is this system that allows cops to dehumanize Black men and allows white men with guns to shoot first and ask questions later.   A criminal prosecution is focused on the narrow actions of the individual alleged to have broken a law. Because a prosecution is an inherently focused, individualized inquiry, the larger cultural forces that have shaped the wrong-doer are left unaddressed. But true justice requires that we confront these cultural forces head on. And a criminal prosecution simply can't do that.   Two days before Michael was killed, many of us breathed a collective sigh of relief. Renisha McBride's killer was convicted. Renisha, a 19-year-old young woman, knocked on the door of a white man's house in Dearborn Heights, Michigan after getting in a car accident. The man who came to the door shot her dead, allegedly mistaking her for an intruder -- a criminal.   It's clear that had Renisha been white, and had all other circumstances been the same--she would have lived.  This certainty is grounded in part, in the cultural and historical context that shaped the interaction between Renisha and her murderer. Renisha's murderer came from a community that for almost 40 years, was lead by Mayor Orville Hubbard, who was famously known the most devout segregationist north of the Mason-Dixon Line. He was beloved by his community. And he was a public, vehement racist. (Renisha was murdered in Dearborn Heights -- a town that was annexed from Dearborn in the 1960s and one that shares overlapping public schools and culture with Dearborn).   In 1965, the United States Department of Justice indicted him for encouraging a crowd of his constituents to throw stones at white resident who was mistakenly believed to have sold his home to a Black family. Mayor Hubbard was acquitted of these civil rights violations--and took the jury who acquitted him out for steak dinners after his trial. In the wake of the 1967 Detroit protests, he ordered his police department to shoot those they deemed ""looters"" on sight. He bragged of an unwritten law that kept Black families out of his town -- and affirmed his commitment to ""complete segregation, one million percent, on all levels.'"" In 1968, he told the New York Times: ""If you have integration, first you have kids going to school together, then next thing you know, they're grab-assing around, then they're getting married and having half-breed kids...Then, you wind up with a mongrel race. And from what I know of history, that's the end of civilization.""   His constituents and predecessors ensured that his racist legacy carried on long after he died--passing a 1986 ballot measure that restricted use of the city's parks to residents only (clearly aimed at keeping Black people from Detroit out of the city.) In the 1990's allegations surfaced that Dearborn Police were targeting Black motorists -- who comprised less that 1 percent of the total population but 90 percent of those pulled over by police for alleged traffic violations. More recently, Arab-Americans reported being barred from voting. This is a place where white supremacy runs deep.   But this fact does not make the Dearborn area unique. The same legacy of white supremacy fueled the killing of Michael Brown. Much has been written about the extensive proof that police engaged in racial profiling in the community and the ""role the police force has preserving the racial order of Ferguson."" St. Louis, Missouri is the home to the Council of Conservative Citizens, the self-proclaimed ""only serious nationwide activist group that sticks up for white rights"". The cultural and historical factors cannot be separated from the killings in either place.   That's why the successful prosecution of Renisha's murderer doesn't make the Dearborn area safer for Black and Brown folks. To the contrary, it appears to have inflamed the murderer's supporters who have posted vile, hate-filled messages on his Facebook page.  And that's why young people organizing in the wake of Michael Brown's killing known that justice must be about more than the criminal prosecution of his killer or police reform. Justice for Michael Brown, for Renisha, for Trayvon, for Eric requires that we confront and acknowledge the legacy of racial hatred and violence that infects our communities and has launched the epidemics of criminalization, brutal, abusive policing and mass incarceration.   Scholars and activists have developed a framework for doing just this called Transforming Historical Harms. Communities in Ferguson, in Dearborn and Detroit, in Chicago, in Los Angeles -- in just about every city in this country are struggling with what scholar and practioner David Anderson Hooker has deemed ""traumagenic historical experiences"" that create and/or contribute current disparities and forms of oppression. These are collective experiences that continue to hurt or limit the lives of individuals, groups, societies and nations. Collective experiences like slavery. Like Jim Crow. Like mass incarceration. Like living in a community that is under siege by the police. This same approach has been used with survivors of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and to address collective harm caused in Australia when the government there systemically and forcefully removed Aboriginal children their homes. The human rights atrocities experienced right here and now in the United States are no less real or urgent.   The approach takes a page from Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, which activists in Michigan, recognizing the deep racial wounds in the state, have proposed for years. In the words of Anderson-Hooker ""Traumagenic events, their legacy and aftermath are all interconnected and fueled by each other. Beliefs held by one group can inflict trauma on another, and traumatic reactions can support the institutionalization of beliefs. These create aftermaths, which continue to inflict trauma and reinforce beliefs."" It this cycle of aftermaths -- which in the United States is currently manifesting in murdered Black young people -- that the Transforming Historical Harms approach aims to end.   The approach requires a collective process through which communities face the realities of their history and the historical harms endured by community members that have current, persistent disparities. Once the reality of the historical harms has been established, communities reform the relationships that serve to currently perpetuate these disparities in the current context. Next comes both healing and taking action by ""interrupting the multi-generational transmission of trauma by changing systems and policies."" Every single community in the United States needs this process -- but Ferguson and Dearborn are uniquely situated to lead the way.   There are undeniable, historical realities regarding our communities, the history of racial oppression and the ways in which the criminal justice system perpetuates this oppression currently. More criminal prosecutions won't tackle these realities at their very roots -- and certainly won't stop the body count from continuing to mount. But the young people leading the movement in Ferguson know their history. And know their current realities. They are poised to help that community--and perhaps the entire country -- confront the historical collective harms in order to create healing and transformative ways forward   Sheila A.

Somali and U.S. officials confirmed on Tuesday that the target of the attacks was Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of Islamist terror group al-Shabab. It is unclear whether Godane survived the attack. Al-ShababAl-Shabab, which means ""the youth"" in Arabic, started as a small faction of radicalized Islamists in Somalia's Islamic Courts Union, an alliance of Sharia courts. The ICU took over Somalia's government in 2006, but the coalition was removed from power with help from the U.S. mere months later. Al-Shabab splintered off from ICU in the wake of the alliance's demise, and grew into what the Council on Foreign Relations describes as a ""full-blown insurgency."" The group's well-established legacy of attacks in East Africa includes last year's assault on Kenya's Westgate Mall, brutal beheadings of suspected spies, as well as suicide bombings -- including one this past Sunday on a high-security prison.Ahmed Abdi GodaneWhile The Telegraph once described Godane as ""Africa's most feared militant leader,"" the little that is known about his personal history may seem at odds with that description at first sight. Godane is thought to be around the age of 37 and may have grown up in northern Somaliland amid difficult circumstances. As The National Post notes, he has a background in accounting and also managed a grocery store with a friend, albeit one who he later ordered killed. He is also believed to be a lover of poetry. Godane has been al-Shabab's spiritual and political leader since 2008. As a Washington Post profile from last year describes, he was a prominent force in taking the militant group from a loose network of hardliners into a relatively cohesive, and notably al-Qaeda-aligned, militant group. His leadership has been described as both brutal and controversial. The Post explains:In areas that the militia controlled, Godane imposed strict Islamic sharia law enforced by public executions, amputations and stonings. The measures were so harsh, Hansen [an analyst specializing in al-Shabab] said, that even Osama bin Laden criticized him for going too far in implementing sharia and for killing other Muslims. Under Godane's rule, al-Shabab steadily internationalized its attacks, hitting targets in Kenya and Uganda. Paul Hidalgo explains in Foreign Affairs that the group has not only plotted against foreign targets but it has also stepped up its recruitment drive abroad in an effort to export its ideology. Godane In ControlThe U.S. has targeted Godane unsuccessfullyin the past. If it is confirmed that al-Shabab's leader was killed in Monday's strike, it would constitute a major blow to the organization. Godane's death may have far-reaching implications. As Clint Watts, a Senior Fellow at GWU's Homeland Security Policy Institute, writes, al-Shabab could fracturing into smaller organizations or other Somali terror groups could break out and try to fill Godane's place. A new leader could even switch al-Shabab's allegiances from al-Qaeda to the Islamic State. "

(AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d4b42100002501c964db.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It appears from what Mitch McConnell said at the opening of his speech to the Koch brothers' secret conference in June, that he found the collection of philosophical speeches reported today by Lauren Windsor in The Huffington Post to be ""inspiring."" I think for most Americans, the word would be appalling.  Now we know not only what the politicians said to the assembled millionaires and billionaires at the retreat, we know the philosophy behind the political activities of the Koch brothers and their various organizations. And the beliefs they espouse are even worse than I had ever imagined they would ever say out loud, even in secret. This is far worse than Romney's infamous 47 percent video, because their views not only about government, but about the political debate in America are so lacking in fundamental decency.  Lauren, whose journalism is officially sponsored by a group I chair, American Family Voices, reported last week on the speeches by U.S. Senate candidates to the wealthy donors at the Koch conference. Those speeches caused quite a stir. But the speeches from Charles Koch, longtime Koch consigliere Richard Fink, and two academics with long and deep ties to the Kochs and right-wing movements are in some ways even more dramatic. They demonstrate without a shadow of doubt the way the Kochs and the people close to them, including politicians, view the world, and it is an ugly, dystopian place. It is a world of Ayn Rand-style paranoid fantasies, where the good guys are swash-buckling wealthy industrialists and the bad guys are the collectivists (both Rand's and Charles Koch's favorite term for liberals) who want to help the parasitic poor and sick and old.  Before I go further, I want to go back to McConnell and the other politicians at the conference. I think it is very likely that the candidates who spoke at the conference would have stayed with all the billionaire funders to hang out the whole time -- if I were a politician and there were 400 millionaire and billionaire political donors closely aligned with me, I sure would have. And there is evidence that many of them did in fact stay longer than the duration of their speeches. In their remarks, some of the candidates reference other speakers at the conference, namely Charles Murray, the author of The Bell Curve. Tom Cotton is on the agenda for the round of golf the first day of the event, and then for speaking two days later. And McConnell, on the day all of these crazy ideological speeches were given, starts his remarks clearly implying he was there for the whole day: ""It's been a long but very inspiring day.""  If I'm a reporter covering these races, here's what I would want to know from these candidates: Do they agree that Democrats are just like Hitler, Mao, Stalin, Lenin, North Korea, and suicide bombers? Do they agree that government should be limited to the police and military? Do they think liberals want people to be unemployed and hopeless so that they can be recruited to fascism? Were they present when those remarks were made, and if so, why didn't they object or raise questions? And I'd want to know that of all the other Republican candidates being supported so heavily by the Koch brothers.  The fact is, the things said on these tapes are far more blunt than Romney in his 47 percent moment. This is crazy stuff, folks, and the politicians who were partying with these extremists ought to be held to account.   I couldn't believe it when Charles Koch -- who paid at least $870,000 to buy out one of the most luxurious hotels in the country, so conference attendees wouldn't have to fear talking to anyone else on the grounds, who was surrounded by a phalanx of security, who was hosting some of the most powerful Republicans in the country -- spoke about the great courage he and his brother have because of the ""firing squad."" It reminds me a lot of the Rand groupies with their ""Where's John Galt?"" buttons. (Maybe if this whole trying to buy the politicians thing doesn't work out for them, the Kochs will take to blowing up factories the way Galt did.) When Koch decries government supporting corporate cronyism and subsidies, it is another exercise in fantasy: The oil industry, which the Koch fortune is built on, ""is among the most heavily subsidized businesses, with tax breaks available at virtually every stage of the exploration and extraction process,"" according to the New York Times.  The most explosive part of these speeches is that they pretty much flat-out say that modern American progressives -- by which they seem to mean everyone to the left of John McCain -- are the equivalent of Hitler, Mao, Lenin, Stalin, the North Korean government, and suicide bombers. You think I'm exaggerating, but they actually conflate the Democratic Party with totalitarian regimes. They believe that liberals want people to become unemployed, lose their faith and families, and become dependent on government, so that it will be easier to recruit them for a new fascist state. Again, if you think I am kidding, read the transcripts. This is what they really believe.  The outrageous nature of these statements may obscure the more deeply troubling part of what they truly believe. Their ""freedom"" agenda consists of the most extreme form of economic libertarianism imaginable, and that they now essentially have bought the Republican Party as a wholly owned subsidiary is frightening for our future. In his presentation to the group, Dr. Will Ruger, the vice president of research and policy of Charles Koch Institute, described their theory of government:Government is thus limited to a small, but absolutely critical number of tasks, basically keeping our neighborhoods and cities safe from crime, defending our country from those who might violate our national territories, our commerce at sea, and providing justice in a fair and apolitical -- political court system.That means no Social Security, no Medicare or Medicaid, no public support of any kind for the severely disabled, no public prenatal care or assistance for hungry or homeless children, no minimum wage or regulation of safe working conditions, no child labor laws, no emergency assistance in the case of natural disaster, no food or water or drug or consumer safety protections, no oversight of financial markets or banks, no environmental laws of any kind, no public roads or bridges or schools. It is the wild, wild West, where whoever has the fastest gun or the most money can make all the rules and the devil take the hindmost. Or, as Ruger quotes from a conservative thinker, ""Unless men are free to be vicious, they cannot be virtuous."" And in their uber-libertarian world, there will no doubt be plenty of viciousness.  Fink's speech was the ultimate ode to this kind of extreme libertarianism. What does he think when he sees the homeless? ""Get off your ass, and work hard like we did."" (Apparently not seeing the irony of his patrons the Kochs getting their money and company from their father's inheritance.) What does he think about people on minimum wage? ""People are being paid more than their value-added.""  But it wasn't all political theory. Fink laid out a political strategy of appealing to the middle third of Americans who are neither ""freedom-loving"" nor ""collectivists."" The key, he said, is convincing those swing voters that conservatives have good intent, through focusing on meaning and well-being more than economics in their messaging. He then offered the Koch brothers' support of the United Negro College Fund as an example of this strategy.  The highlight of Fink's speech, indeed of all these philosophical speeches, was that as he was continuing to talk about good intent, he said:Yeah, we want decrease regulations. Why? It's because we can make more profit, okay? Yeah, cut government spending so we don't have to pay so much taxes (inaudible). There's truth in that, you all know, because we're in the 30 percent of the freedom fighters. But the middle part of the group doesn't see it that way.So, yeah, there's the ""freedom fighters"" for you, fighting for the freedom to profit.Fink's speech lays out the dilemma of the Koch political philosophy pretty well. They want fewer government taxes, regulations, and labor laws so that they can make more profits. That is the end-all and be-all of how they define freedom. But the problem is that swing voters don't see it the same way, so the Kochs have to convince them of their good intentions. It is a hard problem to solve when the Kochs want to get rid of everything in government that helps people outside of police and the military.  There is so much more here -- Fink talking about how he studied climate change for six years and was never able to figure it out, Victor Hanson quoting Tocqueville and Aristotle on the downsides of equality and democracy. The hits just kept coming, so it is well worth checking out these transcripts yourself. They will blow your mind with how far to the right these billionaires and their friends go. But the voters in states like Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, and Kentucky ought to especially read them, and ask the politicians who are such good friends of the Kochs if they, too, believe all this crazy stuff."
7,POLITICS,#HealSTL: A Movement to Fix the Wrongs That Have Plagued Ferguson,"Yasmine Taeb, ContributorAttorney specializing in civil rights and civil liberties",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/healstl-a-movement-to-fix_b_5733948.html,"A sense of awakening has occurred in Ferguson, an awakening that by all accounts has given residents a sense of self-determination that will follow them to the ballot box.",2014-09-02,2014-08-29-10574383_678460108382_3024086035489997495_n1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-29-10574383_678460108382_3024086035489997495_n1-thumb.jpg,"The killing of teenager Michael Brown has galvanized an entire nation and sparked a discussion on race relations and policing that has long been over due. This past week, I traveled to Ferguson with a group of activists from Washington, DC. While we all had different reasons for traveling to Ferguson and came from a mix of ethnic, racial, socioeconomic, and educational backgrounds, we all shared a mutual passion for social justice and felt an obligation to stand in solidarity with the people of Ferguson, to march with them and call to heal the wrongs that have plagued Ferguson.  Photo credit: Randall Keith Benjamin IIThough my time in Ferguson was brief, what I saw there brought home the very real and justified sense of oppression many of our fellow Americans feel - a sentiment derived from a deep-seated communal experience with police racism and brutality. Every Ferguson resident I spoke to seemed simply fed up with years of police harassment, inequality, lack of job prospects, neglect, and no representation in the political system. Our institutions have clearly failed to address the needs of many of the residents in Ferguson and beyond. And the tragic death of this teen was simply a catalyst - the latest in what many Americans view as a long-established pattern of how police treat black men. It was only a matter of time before people took to the streets to demand change. The sense of oppression that drove hundreds of people out from their homes in Ferguson was palpable. From the perspective of many of these residents - and largely unknown to many Americans - their community has been under siege. We've heard the statistics: 2/3 of Ferguson residents are black but only three of 53 officers in the city are black; the mayor, police chief, and most of the city council is white. In 2013, 92% of all vehicle stops and 93% of arrests made were of African-Americans. The poverty rate in Ferguson is also double the rate of the surrounding St. Louis County, with unemployment nearly tripled since 2000. In Ferguson, the sense of persecution was only reinforced by the initial police reaction to the protests. Demonstrators were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, stun grenades, armored vehicles, and rows of riot police in full military-gear and armed with semi-automatic weapons. The sight of such a militarized police response to largely peaceful protests sent shockwaves throughout the country and the world, and started a much-needed discussion on the state of militarization of our police forces. I did however notice signs of a softening of policing measures, with police distributing water to demonstrators on Saturday afternoon. Missouri Highway Patrol and St. Louis County officers also joined community members Saturday evening to distribute 1,100 bags of food to residents in Canfield Green Apts, just feet from where Michael Brown was gunned down. Though seemingly just a PR stunt, these small acts did not go unnoticed in the community. One local resident told me that she appreciated seeing the St. Louis officers help with the food distribution and made the salient point that ""while there are a lot of crooked cops out there, not all are bad...just like not all black people are thugs."" Our group of 41 activists strategized with Alderman Antonio French of the 21st Ward Saturday morning, before joining more than a thousand demonstrators in an NAACP Youth March. Antonio French told us the goal is to register several thousand Ferguson residents to vote. ""We can change this place,"" he said. ""The example we show in Ferguson can inspire other communities.""  Photo credit: #DCtoFerguson Facebook group page As I walked to the site on Saturday where Michael Brown was killed to register voters, I saw dozens of neighbors standing outside, socializing and playing games. One young man I spoke to about the recent protests told me he is tired of the police killing black men as if they are ""insignificant"" and ""sub-human."" Another older black woman told a colleague of mine that she'd like to vote but can't read. A sense of awakening has occurred in Ferguson, an awakening that by all accounts has given residents a sense of self-determination that will follow them to the ballot box. By protesting and demanding change, the residents of Ferguson have ensured that they will not tolerate the status quo and will not remain marginalized.  Photo credit: Yasmine TaebThese latest events in Ferguson also necessitate new legislation by our elected officials that will directly address police brutality and racial profiling. The End Racial Profiling Act (ERPA) introduced in the House by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) and in the Senate by Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD), would prohibit profiling by law enforcement on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. And supporting an initiative in Congress by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) requesting the Department of Justice to fund the adoption of body cameras by local and state law enforcement is necessary to ensure transparency and accountability. Ferguson residents have heroically ensured that Michael Brown's death was not in vain and that this will not be a moment but rather a movement: to heal St. Louis and America.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post erroneously stated that Alderman Antonio French said that his goal is to register 20,000 Ferguson residents to vote. In fact, Ferguson's total population is about 20,000; French's goal is to register several thousand of them to vote. The post has been updated accordingly."

Fred Sauter (book and lyrics) is an inquisitive, strapping lad, red-haired (will get back to you about whether it's the real color), often spotted in cutoffs and a nice range of whackadoodle tees. He wears a smile that can be turned up from one corner, or both, for full effect. Composer Paul Leschen wears a droll glance at the world around him, and a 'GiRLS gone WILD' tractor cap. Each time you see him, his beard will have been slightly reshaped.Q: You've been carrying on about Bedbugs!!! for six years. It's a musical, I am told. PAUL: This is true. FRED: That's correct. They sing. But it's not a stupid show about bedbugs taking over someone's apartment. It's far grander in scale.Q: Is it okay if we sorta don't hear about how a case of scabies inspired your show? Ew.  FRED: People always ask me if I've had bedbugs, and I haven't luckily, but I tell them, I've had something just as disgusting, so I know what it was like to go through the experience. That's why I say it. And it did inspire the show. Q: It's a musical. So plenty of 'gay characters'? Any gay bedbugs? PAUL: Our heroine's assistant is a gay 20-something, and his boyfriend is a hipster like the kind you'll occasionally see on Girls. He's the one who's ill-fated I guess. His demise presents a catharsis to all New Yorkers of a certain age who can remember the city before that other pestilence infested the town--the smug, skinny, baby-faced Millennials. FRED: As for the gay bedbugs, there were just TOO many gay side-plots in the last draft. It was dizzying to follow.  PAUL: Just tell them our show is gay, gay, gay.Q: Okay, will do. What was the first song you worked on together? Did THAT get cut? PAUL: Our Queen-esque multi-part bug dance number ""Bedbug Anthem"" was the first song I believe. FRED: It's the song in which the mutant bedbugs hatch and grow up and 'Cimex' asserts himself as their king. It is very much still in the show.  PAUL: ...I'm retooling it right now actually.Q: The buzz was delirious when Bedbugs!!! was the darling of the theatre festival circuit. Is it true you have 'Bedheads' who have seen the show several times and are lining up for tickets for the Off-Broadway run? FRED: Gee, I sure hope so! People seem to like it a lot.PAUL: Yeah, people always wait until the last few shows and then it sells out and we have a line out the door. Since this run actually lasts for eight weeks, I expect that to start happening a week or so after opening. I've recognized some repeat customers for sure, and I'm not just talking about my cousin Gloria. Bedbugs!!! director Robert Bartley, producer Dale Joan Young with Sauter and LeschenQ: Who would you most love to love your show? FRED: George W. Bush; wouldn't that be amazing? (His war on terror inspired the main character Carly's war on bedbugs.)  PAUL: I would freak out if I found out that David Bowie liked the show.Q: Who else is a big GLBTQ hero? FRED: John Waters. PAUL: These days it's Franz Schubert. That's unconfirmed though. Can I say Matthew Shepherd? His tragic story did so much to further the cause. He's basically the Jesus of Latter Day Queers.Q: A hero of mine, Rachel Carson, gets referenced in the show. Even though your song 'Silent Spring' is sensational, ultimately do you see yourself as laughing at, or supporting environmental activists - and the truly spooky climate collapse predictions? FRED: Oh come on, we ALL know global warming is a myth. It's natural that the ice caps should be melting, the water rising, and the temperatures changing. Didn't you know, God put us on this Earth to enjoy and use up all of His resources for us, because we are His children. No use cryin' over spilt oil! PAUL: Supporting. It's not a laughing matter, and I'm glad there are some unironic, earnest people out there calling us out and trying to make a difference. Even if, ultimately, we are doomed.Nicholas Park as Rachel Carson; photo detail by Rex BonomelliQ: Who might be inspired to save the world if you got them to see Bedbugs!!!? FRED: The cast of Jersey Shore. PAUL: If only George W. Bush could have seen it. He would have responded to 9/11 in a different way. I mean, when you have a familial grudge on your shoulders and you throw poison back at the chosen enemy, you're only adding fire to the flames. The moral of our story is to, um, let it go. All the bad stuff. The baggage, the issues, whatever you want to call them--those unwanted visitors that torment you every night while you try to sleep.Q: Do you think the rats, roaches and bedbugs will be happy in NYC after we humanfolk go extinct? PAUL: Nope. Nobody is ever happy in New York. The rats be like, ""I wanna move to LA."" FRED: I think the rats and roaches will do just fine, but the bedbugs NEED us to feed on. After a year with no blood, they are done for.Q: What's your favorite horror film? FRED: Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, and Trolls. PAUL: Is Female Trouble a horror film? If not, then maybe I Know What You Did Last Summer. Good campy 90s fun.Q: Your favorite sci-fi musical? FRED: Well, there really aren't a ton to choose from, so I'll be obvious: tie between Little Shop & Rocky Horror. PAUL: The Sound of Music Part II: Outer Space.Q: Your favorite MTV video? PAUL: From back in the day when they had videos? Total Eclipse, hands down. JAMIE: Especially the key change when the 'student' lifts the fencing mask and glitter pours out. FRED: Madonna's Like a Prayer, of course. JAMIE: The amazing director Mary Lambert and featuring Leon Robinson of Leon and the Peoples! Pretty timely for our 'Summer of Ferguson' 2014.Q: What's YOUR worst grudge? FRED: Now how can I choose just one? Aren't all humans just the best thing on the planet? PAUL: I count myself blessed to have such wonderful human relationships. Especially with my bf and my supportive family. My worst human relationship, I think, is with the woman from Time Warner Cable. Q: What else makes you feel crushed like a bug? FRED: You can't crush me, my exoskeleton is impenetrable. PAUL: Bad coffee, being told to wait to be seated until my whole party arrives, and ""We are delayed because of train traffic ahead of us, we apologize for the inconvenience.""Q: Got a favorite Rocky Horror ""talk-back""?  (AUTHOR'S INDULGENT NOTE: Back when one could dumpster dive without bedbug phobia, I found a giant cracked prop wedding ring in the garment district - and kids, Rocky Horror midnight screening lord Sal Piro never dolled out credit specifically to me, but I'm pretty sure the ring I held up that night at the Waverly was the first of many to follow.) What's your fave? FRED: ""No, Sue's to blame!"" (I love that it's a shout out to the costume designer, and it's just so random.) PAUL: I just like the toast. I never really got into the whole costume talk back thing. It seems like homework to learn all that stuff. Though I can probably perform every 80s/early 90s Madonna song on the piano right now if you asked me to. JAMIE: In our crystal ball we see a Below 54 gig for you... Chris Hall with LeschenQ: Some of your cast could help you book that gig, too! Performers in Bedbugs!!! are already the stuff of cult legend in theatre circles. Anyone who's seen Chis Hall as Cimex tends to blither excitedly. And Brian Charles Rooney's four octave range is nearly twice that of the Canadian chanteuse that Brian parodies with such relish.Sauter with Brian Charles RooneyFRED: They are both legends. And both have been developing the show with us since our first reading in 2007.  PAUL: Yup! But Celine Dion does indeed have an enormous vocal range and she isn't shy in exposing us to it.Q: And then there's Carly, the lonely exterminator who becomes the mutant queen bee (er- queen bug). Grace McLean, fresh from 'Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812'... She's sure to reinvent the role since Lena Hall, who completely rocked as Carly, is currently, uh 'preoccupied'...  FRED: We have been lucky to have incredible talent to help us develop this show over the last few years. Each actress has brought something unique to the lead role. Lena Hall was the first, in The New York Musical Festival and she was maddeningly good, and her voice is off the charts. Marissa Rosen was sensational in the Chernuchin showcase production. And we are very excited to see what Grace McLean will bring to the role Off Broadway. Q: A veritable talent infestation. Fred, what NYU Tisch classmate do you think will become a star- other than yourself? FRED: Well, Joe Iconis already is one. We had a ridiculously talented class, and I think many of them will. ... Michael R. Jackson, Rachel Peters, Brett Macias, to name a few. Q: Paul, what is your favorite Scissor Sisters track - that YOU didn't arrange or play keyboard for? Night Work album, maybe Any Which Way or Whole New Way. I also adore Can't Come Quickly Enough from way back.Q: What's the one thing you don't want the world to know about Bedbugs!!!? FRED: Maybe you should ask that question to the bedbugs...  PAUL: I'm just glad nobody has ever seen some of our script drafts between the NYMF production and the 2012 showcase. There was some crazy stuff in there. Aliens, if I'm not mistaken...Q: Will you wear a codpiece opening night? FRED: I don't need to. Duh.  PAUL: Why is this night different from all other nights?Chris Hall as Cimex in Bedbugs!!! -- costume by Philip Heckman; photo by Rex BonomelliFull journalistic disclosure. Author Jamie Leo is double-dipping here. He has designed all these creepy promotional graphics for Bedbugs!!! that you see all over NYC.

PAUL: Bad coffee, being told to wait to be seated until my whole party arrives, and ""We are delayed because of train traffic ahead of us, we apologize for the inconvenience.""Q: Got a favorite Rocky Horror ""talk-back""?  (AUTHOR'S INDULGENT NOTE: Back when one could dumpster dive without bedbug phobia, I found a giant cracked prop wedding ring in the garment district - and kids, Rocky Horror midnight screening lord Sal Piro never dolled out credit specifically to me, but I'm pretty sure the ring I held up that night at the Waverly was the first of many to follow.) What's your fave? FRED: ""No, Sue's to blame!"" (I love that it's a shout out to the costume designer, and it's just so random.) PAUL: I just like the toast. I never really got into the whole costume talk back thing. It seems like homework to learn all that stuff. Though I can probably perform every 80s/early 90s Madonna song on the piano right now if you asked me to. JAMIE: In our crystal ball we see a Below 54 gig for you... Chris Hall with LeschenQ: Some of your cast could help you book that gig, too! Performers in Bedbugs!!! are already the stuff of cult legend in theatre circles. Anyone who's seen Chis Hall as Cimex tends to blither excitedly. And Brian Charles Rooney's four octave range is nearly twice that of the Canadian chanteuse that Brian parodies with such relish.Sauter with Brian Charles RooneyFRED: They are both legends. And both have been developing the show with us since our first reading in 2007.  PAUL: Yup! But Celine Dion does indeed have an enormous vocal range and she isn't shy in exposing us to it.Q: And then there's Carly, the lonely exterminator who becomes the mutant queen bee (er- queen bug). Grace McLean, fresh from 'Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812'... She's sure to reinvent the role since Lena Hall, who completely rocked as Carly, is currently, uh 'preoccupied'...  FRED: We have been lucky to have incredible talent to help us develop this show over the last few years. Each actress has brought something unique to the lead role. Lena Hall was the first, in The New York Musical Festival and she was maddeningly good, and her voice is off the charts. Marissa Rosen was sensational in the Chernuchin showcase production. And we are very excited to see what Grace McLean will bring to the role Off Broadway. Q: A veritable talent infestation. Fred, what NYU Tisch classmate do you think will become a star- other than yourself? FRED: Well, Joe Iconis already is one. We had a ridiculously talented class, and I think many of them will. ... Michael R. Jackson, Rachel Peters, Brett Macias, to name a few. Q: Paul, what is your favorite Scissor Sisters track - that YOU didn't arrange or play keyboard for? Night Work album, maybe Any Which Way or Whole New Way. I also adore Can't Come Quickly Enough from way back.Q: What's the one thing you don't want the world to know about Bedbugs!!!? FRED: Maybe you should ask that question to the bedbugs...  PAUL: I'm just glad nobody has ever seen some of our script drafts between the NYMF production and the 2012 showcase. There was some crazy stuff in there. Aliens, if I'm not mistaken...Q: Will you wear a codpiece opening night? FRED: I don't need to. Duh.  PAUL: Why is this night different from all other nights?Chris Hall as Cimex in Bedbugs!!! -- costume by Philip Heckman; photo by Rex BonomelliFull journalistic disclosure. Author Jamie Leo is double-dipping here. He has designed all these creepy promotional graphics for Bedbugs!!! that you see all over NYC. Like so many others, he fell into the 'infestation infatuation' after hearing - and becoming smitten - by the score of the show. "

Especially if that home is your homeworld.",2014-09-02,2015-07-06-1436193423-6697002-dkfjkdjfiejfkdnfkdjnmdhvmdnvjdhrjhuueueu3333unnamed.gif,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-06-1436193423-6697002-dkfjkdjfiejfkdnfkdjnmdhvmdnvjdhrjhuueueu3333unnamed.gif,"I am indeed a practical dreamer. My dreams are not airy nothings. I want to convert my dreams into realities as far as possible.  -- MK GandhiTwo visionaries of very different types penned these moving statements as World War II erupted around the troubled globe. Gandhi's convictions would take him to jail; Wells's would keep him scouting fires in London as Nazi bombs blew out the windows of his house. Both men sensed that apocalypse anticipates renewal as surely as descent precedes rise. Our time is one of apocalypse, an archetype found in the lore and myth of many times and peoples. As we face crises of ecology, economy, religion, politics, finance, education, agriculture, housing, water, air, and soil, as Earth overheats, species go extinct, and the air-giving oceans die on every side, we wonder how to make sense of it all, or indeed whether it's even possible to. ""It's all a question of story,"" wrote ""geologian"" Thomas Berry, priest and environmentalist, as things began to slide downhill. ""We are in trouble just because we do not have a good story. We are between stories. The old story, the account of how we fit into it, is no longer effective. Yet we have not learned the new story."" But how are we to compose it if we cannot even imagine it?Practical versus DreamerMore and more of us are share with war refugees and abuse survivors the loss of the capacity to envision a better story, a tale better than the one we now live. Like the laboratory dogs shocked repeatedly into helplessness by the inventor of Positive Psychology, we allow self-styled experts and leaders of the sort who only ever plunge us into catastrophe--the greedy, the narcissistic, the power-hungry, the violent--to go on about their terrible business as we march in step toward species-wide extinction. Yet the racketeers whom we distinguish with titles like ""statesman"" and ""world leader"" hang onto power by keeping better visions invisible.""Practical dreamer."" The dire global situation is largely a nonverbal reply to the question of what happens when we tear those two words apart.CG Jung noticed that two psychologies universally present flourish when operating side by side. He used the Latin word senex--""old"" woman or man--to identify the practical, the detail-oriented, the structure-favoring, orderly, elderly-thinking psychology. This word forms the root of the English word ""senator."" Puer--""young""; a girl or boy--refers to the psychology of ideas in motion, utopian visions, creative impulses, and flights of fancy. Skeptic and idealist, culture critic and utopian, extraverted fact-gatherer and introverted intuitive, deconstructor and synthesizer, bottom-liner and visionary need to influence each other to maintain inner and outer balance. ""Practical"" without ""dreamer"" never flies, dares nothing, strangles new ideas in their cribs: ""Yes, but how can you make a living from it?"" ""Dreamer"" without ""practical"" never lands, gets lost in leaps of ideas, satisfies itself with dreams but does not ever realize them: ""I don't get my hands dirty: I'm a visionary."" The ""practical"" without dreaming hardens into a cynic who believes in nothing and discounts everything not nailed down; the ""dreamer"" without practicality thinks chanting and journaling will save the world. Seen through this psychological lens, fundamentalist religion and scientism (the nonscientific ideology that only science offers true knowledge) look less like opponents than like senexian twins caught in futile mutual combat. With the mythical All-Seeing Eye of God we might pair the eyeball-shaped ""ship of the imagination"" that sails through the recent remake of Cosmos, subtitled A Spacetime Odyssey. A cyclops showed up in the original Odyssey as well, and his monocular mode of narrow vision reappears whenever we lose the ability to grasp that our perspective is a perspective subject to human limitations. Permaculture designers tell us that Nature wastes nothing. Where waste piles up is where we have broken a natural cycle. Puer should lead and follow senex, who should follow puer. Disrupting this rhythm breaks a natural social and psychological cycle.During a classroom discussion about puer and senex, one of my Chinese graduate students drew a figure on the whiteboard:This is xiao (""shao""), the character for filial piety (nao in Japanese). It brings younger and elder, ideal and real, future and past, dream and practicality together into one figure, showing, at least ideally, how the two psychologies meet. How to soften the line that separates them?DreamwalkingPerhaps a start would be seeing how dreaming and visioning can give rise to practical considerations. Will you take a walk with me?The word ""imagination"" has a Latin root: imaginare, ""form an image of."" ""Fantasy"" comes from ""to make visible."" Sometimes I walk around the neighborhood imagining how things could be different. These repellent stucco cottages, for instance, most of which will collapse in the next big earthquake. Why do we not build beautiful structures to last? And why not more room between them, more trees, more food gardens, more open spaces where neighbors can converse? On a windy day the towering palm tree planted next door where no palm would naturally stand threatens to clobber the passerby with a heavy falling frond.I pass an apartment building with dozens of TV dishes on the roof. There is American hyper-individualism for you. Surely one dish would do. Or none...In a park I note the children playing together: black, yellow, red, white, mixed... They're already realizing a better world. Diversity isn't just a trendy idea or a corporate fad: it's how Earth grows healthy ecosystems, how the personality welcomes its wholeness into consciousness, how we grow healthy societies....Teen males in a passing car roll down tinted windows to hoot at young women having a chat on the sidewalk. Lyrics about ""booty"" and ""bitches"" also pour out. I imagine a time when brutal economic demands don't keep working parents apart from children or elders warehoused away from the distracted young spellbound by digital upgrades of Plato's cave of shadow shapes. I imagine respectful young men, and confident women who walk free of the fear of abuse and violence, peacefully reaching adulthood.....Smoke on the horizon: another blast at the oil refinery. Poor families running for cover and not finding any. Why do we still use petroleum? No casualties or damage to report at the local wind farm....Here is a crumpled paper bag with a McDonald's logo, the contents dumped two feet from a trashcan. By heart-wrenching contrast, how much cleaner and lighter things are when we grow up in reverence of place and land and Earth......See with one look around the consequences of imagination's failure, and reflect on the healthier and happier possibilities.Overidentification with--meaning: psychological possession by--the inner-critic senex who chops down our fantasies as impractical is not the only reason we fail to dream. To imagine what we might never see is to risk bitter disappointment. Easier to lapse into hopeless cynicism or the child stance of learned helplessness: ""The powers that be won't permit it."" Indeed, staying chained to the fear of doing without is exactly where the ruling institutions of a dark time want to keep us. The awakened ability to dream, to love, and to organize is the greatest threat faced by those who hold power illegitimately.But we too are the powers that be, and we can choose not to be fooled or bullied into silent passivity. Paul Tillich put it like this: It takes tremendous courage to resist the lure of appearances. The power of being which is manifest in such courage is so great that the gods tremble in fear of it.As I walk around and dream with my eyes open, I reflect (moving from puer to senex) that everything I've just hoped for already thrives somewhere. We might not see it in our standardized and hystericized ""news,"" or hear about it in a classroom organized like an assembly line, but all over the world, countless experiments in living in peace, justice, and beauty unfold. Communities free of racism and sexism, ableism and ageism. Soils nurtured to produce clean food. Art and festival celebrating earthly joy. Young and old enjoying each other's company. It's all out there, and more, happening in a million places around the blue-green globe.So why not just scale it up? Viewing EarthriseAs I continue my stroll I recall a Star Trek: The Next Generation episode in which Samuel Clemens, brought forward into the 24th century, is given a tour of the spacious, family-friendly Enterprise by the ship's counselor. Although he grumbles a lot, especially about the absence of decent cigars, his suspiciousness gives way to cautious approval. After asking whether a green-skinned crew member he just spotted is a slave, he is surprised by the ensuing exchange:Deanna Troi: The people you see are here by choice.Although Star Trek has since continued its degeneration into post-Roddenberry militaristic adventurism, the puzzle of how to dream up and implement a worldwide, Earth-honoring culture of justice and belonging and even delight seems less of a puzzle when we realize we already have most of the pieces. We need not dream, or build, from scratch. Just keep putting pieces together. We need not and cannot wait until the 24th century.And we have a beacon: the image of Earth rising as a shining symbol of hope. Our still-beautiful planet seen as a whole for the first time in the history of the human family. The Overview Effect is what today's astronauts call it when a newcomer to space comes under the thrall of Earth's glowing loveliness glimpsed from orbit. ""The stars don't look bigger,"" observed astronaut Sally Ride, ""but they do look brighter... When I wasn't working, I was usually at a window looking down at Earth.""From space I saw Earth--indescribably beautiful with the scars of national boundaries gone. --Muhammad Ahmad FarisBut as Rakesh Sharma pointed out, ""One does not have to undertake a space flight to come by this feeling.""Dreaming TerraniaSometimes I like to imagine myself an early citizen of a near-future Earthrise-appreciating civilization here already in pieces awaiting thoughtful assembly, first in dream, and then on the ground. I like to fantasize about how its citizens will live together, what they will wear, what their customs and festivals will be like, how large a part art and dance and music will play in their locally grown, reciprocally supportive centers of culture. Will they regard the image of Earth as their emblem, the glowing symbol of an intercultural, interspecies togetherness-in-diversity finally achieved after agonizing millennia of groping forward? I picture their historians looking back on our time of troubles and wondering how their bright present--our future--could emerge from it, the rise following the descent. ""We had to learn,"" they remind each other, ""to take matters into our own hands, for our own good and that of our planet, instead of submitting to leaders devoid of conscience or vision. We had to limit the influence of those who turn us against each other. We had to find out how to move into full human maturity. And we had to learn to make the inward descent, the psychospiritual apocalypse, staying alive to the dissolution of our most rigidly held worldviews while waiting for a hopeful image to rise from the abyss.""The alternative? Just a sad epitaph no one will ever read: ""Humanity [dates here]. Never learned how to enact the descent inwardly, acted it out literally instead. Exeunt omnes.""We should play at living like future Earth culture citizens now, I muse, by dramatizing the New Story into being one playlet at a time. With that, a meteor passes hissing over my head on the way down into the Pacific. Never been that close to one. Wow. Where are you, Merlin?However, if we are ever to assemble Terrania (as I like to call my own fantasy of a just and peaceful planetary society: what is yours?), we must prove worthy of it by facing the disasters breaking all around us, daring to dream beyond them, and organizing conversations so we can share these dreams forward into practices. It's not a matter of pulling down institutions and power hierarchies to make way for new experiments in consciousness and culture: pulling down is part of the violent old mentality, and the institutions and hierarchies are already crumbling, incapable of adapting to either locally felt needs or planet-wide consequences. Facing up to this reality clears imaginal space for playing with, celebrating, dramatizing new ideas about how to live in beauty with our planet and each other. As we dream we might also distinguish genuine hope from false hope. In actuality just the flip side of disillusionment, false hope puts its trust in crumbling governments, authoritarian sects, unsustainable technologies, or otherworldly speculations as though these could ever save us. By contrast, genuine hope recognizes current obstacles but aligns itself with future possibilities. It is the mood that accompanies realistic faith that we can do better, individually and collectively. In Spanish and other languages, esperar, ""to hope,"" also means ""to wait for"" and ""to expect."" We might add: to demand.As long as the Earth can make a spring every year, I can. As long as the Earth can flower and produce nurturing fruit, I can, because I'm the Earth. I won't give up until the Earth gives up. --Alice WalkerFor me, my imaginary Terranian citizenship does not conflict with my status as a Californian and an American, just as a true planetary culture would include all the fruits of locally grown attachments. I think of the international soul-force of Gandhi's liberatory work, and of Wells's universal rights given form decades later by a UN committee led by Eleanor Roosevelt. For these and other practical dreamers the split between loyalties neighborly, regional, and political deserves no recognition.As the sun sets and my steps point homeward, I remember a recent podcast in which an environment scientist confessed that his data left him no room to hope that humanity would survive global warming. We should heed such voices of despair even while realizing they announce, if not the end of the world, at least the limits of the senexian scientistic worldview of prediction, materialism, and control. Anything can happen and often does, for ""there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."" Or, switching from Shakespeare to Gary Snyder: ""Nature bats last.""Imagine if we gathered in small groups to dream up ideas about finer, larger futures, then pooled the ideas to see which resonated most strongly and most ached for realization. What might we invent? What might reinvent us? If millennia of oppression since Sargon the First conquered Sumer reveal anything, it's that planning from the top down only fosters more oppression, and that facts and plans without rich stories see only from outside, each a flying cyclops stripped of flesh and feeling. Perhaps it's time to try planting visions from the ground up and watering those that take root. Who knows? In restorying how we can live here, we might just prove that you can go home again. Especially if that home is your homeworld. "

Orso came to the game with her parents, Molly and Barry Orso, because they had heard about the lemonade stand and wanted to make a donation and purchase the book ""Alex and the Amazing Lemonade Stand."" Hundreds of stands were planned in all 50 states across the country with the proceeds going to the organization, ""Alex's Lemonade Stand,"" to fight pediatric cancer. (AP Photo/Ann Heisenfelt)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1cac21f000039012363e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What does taking a single step mean to you? Did you walk to work this morning, or simply walk to the car to drive to work? Did you walk to the kitchen to grab coffee or take the dog for a walk around the block? You probably take thousands of steps each day without realizing it because these steps are insignificant to you. What you may not realize is that for many children who battle childhood cancer, the ability to take a single step can be an insurmountable obstacle. For some, they will be diagnosed with cancer before they learn to walk; for others their disease will take one of their limbs, making it difficult to acclimate; and for even more, the side effects of treatment and a long-fought battle will catch up to them, limiting their movement, but never taking away their motivation. It is in honor of these children, and what they must overcome to take a single step, that we at Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation are asking people everywhere to help us make these seemingly insignificant steps matter this September during National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month as part of Alex's Million Mile - Run. Walk. Ride. We will count each and every step as we work toward collectively logging one million miles throughout the month. Why one million? Because who wouldn't go that distance, and more, to find cures for all kids with cancer? My daughter, Alexandra ""Alex"" Scott fought cancer for nearly her entire life. Diagnosed before her first birthday, she would face many challenges along the way, including something many of us take for granted - the ability to walk. At diagnosis, she had a tumor wrapped around her spine. Surgery was the most prudent option, and the doctors told us that if she survived, she would almost certainly never walk. As Alex did many times over, she would surprise everyone by working through excruciating pain to teach herself how to walk, without ever being able to feel her legs. I think this said a lot about Alex's character, and it was also an influential moment in shaping who she would become. We were told that she would never be able to walk, but with each step she took, she would gain confidence in herself, and in her ability to overcome adversity. Had Alex not been presented with such an obstacle -- would she have ever voiced the idea to host a lemonade stand to find cures for others?Following in Alex's footsteps, literally, childhood cancer survivor 12-year-old Kaela Cruz lives a very active and athletic life each and every day. At the age of 5, Kaela was diagnosed with osteosarcoma and in May of 2007 had an above the knee amputation on her left leg. She loves swimming, tae kwon do, and has completed multiple triathlons. In Kaela's own words, she calls the completion of her first triathlon the big picture moment of her life -- she completed it with a walker, taking her time to finish. This moment proved that she could inspire others through her actions, and made her the person that she is now -- an outgoing, positive, athletic 12-year-old who wants to show people what she is capable of, and that we are all capable of overcoming obstacles in life. Kaela and her family will be logging their miles in September, and with her competitive spirit, I have no doubt that they will be among the top teams! Watch Kaela's inspiring story in the video below, and if you are inspired, join Alex's Million Mile too!As part of last year's very first Alex's Million Mile (then known as the Million Mile Run), childhood cancer fighter Jordan Vincent decided that she wanted to participate. Jordan began battling a rare form of brain cancer in January 2003 at the age of 4. She has spent more than half her life in treatment, including undergoing chemotherapy, radiation and more surgeries than her family cares to remember. With a nickname ""the cancer slayer,"" Jordan has shown remarkable resilience, never letting cancer get her down or stop her from achieving her goals. At the launch of Alex's Million Mile in 2013, we had many competitive people who set goals of running or walking 100 miles on their own. Jordan's goal was a bit more humble, she wanted to walk one mile over the course of the month -- something that would be a true challenge for her. With the assistance of her family, Jordan was able to complete the mile, walking hand in hand with her dad as he supported her through her gait belt. Jordan proved something that elicited memories of my daughter Alex when she decided not to set a price on her lemonade. Alex and Jordan understand that it isn't always about the amount of money (or miles) that you donate -- after all, who knows which dollar will find the cure, or which mile will spark someone's interest to help!These stories may seem a bit disjointed, but I wanted to share them as examples of the various obstacles that childhood cancer fighters have to overcome to take a single step, or walk just one mile. Throughout the days of our lives, we will all meet with some form of adversity. It is adversity that has the ability to make or break us, to shape who we are and what we will become, and for some of us, like Alex, Kaela and Jordan, this adversity will change the lives of others too. In closing, I challenge you to add significance to each and every step that you take this September during National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Whether you are a marathoner, a cyclist, or a casual walker, why not donate the steps you take toward making a difference in the lives of children with cancer. As has been said, the journey of a thousand (or million!) miles begins with a single step. Let's take steps to move toward better treatments and cures for childhood cancers in September, it's not possible for those steps to be deemed insignificant.
