Mahlum's group, Back On My Feet, has helped hundreds of homeless individuals find housing and employment.</span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Exercise has been shown to improve mental health, decrease stress, boost sleep and even change how you see the world, but can it really help the homeless become more self-sufficient?The work of one nonprofit seems to suggest as much. Founded in Philadelphia in 2007 by marathoner Anne Mahlum, Back on My Feet is an unusual program that encourages the homeless to take up running as a means to improve their self-confidence and ultimately help connect them with employment opportunities and independent housing. It is doing just that. As reported by NationSwell, the results of the program -- which is currently running in 11 chapters nationwide -- are promising. Of some 5,200 homeless individuals reached by the program in eight years, 1,300 have moved into independent housing and more than 1,900 have obtained employment. The organization has logged more than 462,000 miles run since 2009. The idea came to Mahlum when she began to form a friendship with a group of homeless men she would encounter along the route of her regular 5:30 a.m. runs. She had picked up running as a means to deal with her father’s gambling problem and thought some of these men might also see their lives improve by upping their physical fitness.As the Los Angeles reported, critics frequently told Mahlum the homeless “don’t run,” but she pressed on with her vision anyway, forgoing what a Channel One News feature called a ""dream job"" in the communications field and launching the running club.A small group of the men, who were living at Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission, eventually joined her running club, with the shelter’s permission, and received a fresh pair of running shoes, running clothing and socks. There are certain expectations of the homeless individuals who participate in the Back on My Feet program. They must sign a dedication contract and agree to be present and on time for runs three times a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Longer runs on the weekend are optional.If members meet those requirements and complete 30 days of the routine, they gain access to educational and job training programs and can apply to financial aid to help them find housing and gain independence. They can also continue to be a part of the club as alumni, helping encourage others starting on their own path to self-improvement.Members of the program have also taken part in big races, including the Chicago Marathon, NYC Marathon and Boston Marathon. But as Mahlum explained to CNN in a 2008 feature, the running at the center of the program is essentially a means to an end, not the end itself.""Running really is a metaphor for life,"" Mahlum told CNN. ""There is always another mile. You just have to take it one step at a time."" Alumni members of the program’s New York chapter would probably agree. One, Ryan, featured by NationSwell has already completed a half-marathon since joining the club seven months ago and is now studying to become a substance abuse counselor. Another, Jerry, works as a doorman and has his own apartment.Also on HuffPost:"

That's not something that LinkedIn or Monster do,"" Warren said, explaining eHarmony's plans to get into the employment industry.""(The career market) is such a big market that we do expect it to grow faster than our core product,"" the octogenarian clinical psychologist and eHarmony CEO said in an interview.Finding love is not easy, and neither is the increasingly crowded online match-making industry.The market is dominated by Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp, owner of Match.com as well as other sites for the lovelorn. IAC has also been gaining market share through acquisitions, including dating app Tinder.Los Angeles-based EHarmony plans to launch its recruitment service -- Elevated Careers -- in 2016, and expects the business to contribute about 60 percent of the company's revenue within three years.In the meantime, visitors to elevatedcareers.com can sign up either as a job-seeker or recruiter.Work on the project has been under way for more than a year. ""It's so important that Elevated Careers is developed to eHarmony standards via client feedback,"" a spokeswoman said.The new service speaks to eHarmony's need to diversify as IAC/InterActiveCorp bulks up ahead of the planned public listing of Match Group, which will hold the company's dating businesses.IAC pushed deeper into the mobile-based dating business last month when it agreed to buy PlentyOfFish.Match Group did not respond to requests for comment on whether it plans to launch a recruitment service.NO IPO FOR NOWEHarmony has no plans to go public, Warren said.""We love the position of being able to manage our own situation and not feel pushed by any public groups,"" he said.""We're very much on the side of remaining private as of this time.""Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at brokerage Benchmark Co, estimates that eHarmony, whose biggest shareholder is Madrone Capital Partners, has a market value of about $1 billion.The U.S. online dating market is worth more than $2 billion annually, he said.In comparison, the online career market -- which includes LinkedIn Corp and Monster Worldwide Inc -- is worth about $6 billion a year, said Lisa Rowan of market research firm IDC.The entire talent acquisition and staffing market worldwide is worth about $94 billion, she said.EHarmony expects ""high and double-digit"" revenue growth in percentage terms this year, to between $275 million and $350 million.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are expected to increase by 50-70 percent both this year and next, said Warren, who turns 81 next month.But he said the contribution from Elevated Careers would be ""minuscule"" as eHarmony spends heavily to develop the business.Both employers and job-seekers will likely pay to use the service, although some features could be free.More than 100 variables will be used to match clients.Apart from skills and experience, the algorithm will attempt to match job-seekers and employers based on such variables as personality - as on the eHarmony site - as well as work and social and cultural values.Warren retired from eHarmony in 2007 but came back as CEO after five years to turn around the business, whose growth was slowing in the face of increasing competition.He cut jobs, bought back shares from Sequoia Capital and slashed the nine-member board to two (now three) -- himself and ""very close friend"" Greg Penner, founder of Madrone Capital and now chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.A compatible match, it seems.(Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Ted Kerr)  Related on HuffPost: "

Circuit, ""the government can impose reasonable restrictions on speech as long as it refrains from suppressing particular viewpoints.""The court drew a distinction between the public sidewalks outside the plaza -- which the Supreme Court in 1983 ruled were a public forum protected by the First Amendment -- and the plaza itself, which can be policed under a federal statute prohibiting ""assemblages"" and ""displays.""The court's opinion included a detailed description and a photograph of the Supreme Court's grounds. The D.C.-based appeals court that decided the case is widely regarded as the second-most important federal court in the country.The case was brought by a man who in 2011 stood on the plaza near the front entrance with a sign around his neck that read “The U.S. Gov. Allows Police To Illegally Murder And Brutalize African Americans And Hispanic People.”After receiving and ignoring three warnings from Supreme Court police, Harold Hodge was arrested and charged under the statute proscribing protests and signs on the plaza. Prosecutors then agreed to dismiss the charges so long as he stayed away from the court's grounds for six months, which he did.Following the dismissal, Hodge sued in federal court, contending the statute violated the First Amendment because it conflicted with his desire to ""engage in peaceful, non-disruptive political speech and expression."" A lower court bought the argument and struck down the statute as unconstitutional. But the D.C. Circuit reversed that decision, reasoning that the plaza is an ""integral"" part of the Supreme Court building, and that the 1949 statute is a ""reasonable, view-point neutral"" way for the government to maintain order. The court noted that Congress could at any time amend the law to allow ""for the robust exercise of First Amendment activity by the general public"" on the plaza. And it made clear that people have unlimited access to the area for ""non-expressive"" purposes -- such as posing for pictures or admiring the premises.So if your goal is to picket and protest at the nation's high court, you're better off sticking to the sidewalks. At least there, the First Amendment still applies."

The teen is a family friend of the victim, police said in the release.""There was a farmer there that actually saw him buckling up his pants and approached the two of them,” Baltimore County Police Officer Shawn Vincent told WJZ-TV. “When the boy saw that he was being approached, he left with the young girl.""The child allegedly told authorities that Fleming repeatedly forced her to perform sex acts several times a year at fairs in Maryland and elsewhere, according to the release.Police are still investigating claims of previous abuse and more charges are possible, the release said.

A second nearby park area also filled with protesters.The rally was one of more than 300 this weekend in Japan protesting Abe's move to loosen the post-war, pacifist constitution's constraints on the military.""Sitting in front of TV and just complaining wouldn't do,"" said Naoko Hiramatsu, a 44-year-old associate professor in French and one of the Tokyo protesters.""If I don't take action and try to put a stop on this, I will not be able to explain myself to my child in the future,"" said Hiramatsu, holding a four-year-old son in her arms in the thick of the protest.Abe in July pushed through parliament's lower house a group of bills that let Japan's armed forces defend an ally under attack, a drastic shift in Japan's post-war security policy.The bills are now before the upper chamber, which is also controlled by Abe's ruling bloc and aims to pass the legislation before parliament's session ends on Sept. 27.Abe's ratings have taken a hit from opposition to the security bills. Media surveys showing those who oppose his government outnumber backers, and more than half are against the security bills.""We need to make the Abe government realize the public is having a sense of crisis and angry. Let's work together to have the bills scrapped,"" Katsuya Okada, head of Japan's largest opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, told the Tokyo rally.The demonstration was the biggest in Tokyo since the mass protests against nuclear power in the summer of 2012, after the March 2011 Fukushima atomic disaster.Also on HuffPost:"

The group detonated explosives in the ancient Baal Shamin temple on Aug. 25, an act that cultural agency UNESCO has called a war crime aimed at wiping out a symbol of Syria's diverse cultural heritage.The extent of the damage at the Temple of Bel was not known, the Observatory said, citing its contacts on the ground.Activists on social media also reported the destruction at the temple, one of Palmyra's most important structures. Islamic State seized Palmyra in May from government forces in a sudden offensive and is tightly controlling communications in the city, according to activists.The group, which has proclaimed a caliphate in territory it holds across Syria and Iraq, has regularly demolished monuments it considers sacrilegious as well as carrying out mass killings.This month the group beheaded the 82-year-old Syrian archaeologist who had looked after Palmyra's ruins for four decades, and hung his body in public, according to Syria's antiquities chief.Also on HuffPost:"

Symptoms include fever, cough, chills and muscle aches.The prison resumed the use of plumbed toilets inside the facility's housing units, but secondary water sources such as bottled water and water tanks will continue to be used for consumption, the corrections department said.The department said it has taken steps to prevent the spread of the disease by serving boxed meals to inmates to avoid exposure to steam and mist during cooking operations and halting visiting and volunteer programs.Portable shower units were also brought in on Saturday, the department said.San Quentin State Prison, home to some 3,700 prisoners, has also stopped taking in new inmates as the investigation continues.Earlier this month officials in New York City announced the end to a Legionnaires' outbreak, which killed 12 and sickened 128 people there.
