Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run, is third at 14 percent.Clinton maintains her edge against potential Republican opponents, however, despite a ""growing perception that by using a personal email account and server while serving as secretary of state she did something wrong,"" it said.Clinton leads every Republican head-to-head, including a 6-point margin over real estate mogul Donald Trump, who leads the crowded Republican field.CNN said the poll conducted from Thursday to Sunday found 44 percent of adult Americans had a favorable view of Clinton and 53 percent unfavorable, her worst showing since March 2001.That compared with 45 percent favorable and 48 percent unfavorable in a July CNN poll.Clinton's use of her private email while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 came to light in March and drew fire from political opponents who accused her of sidestepping transparency and record-keeping laws.Officials from U.S. intelligence agencies have so far identified 305 emails from Clinton's private server to be reviewed for potentially classified information, the State Department said in a court filing on Monday.Asked about her use of the private email account, about 56 percent of poll respondents said Clinton did something wrong, up from 51 percent in March, CNN said. Thirty-nine-percent said she did nothing wrong.The CNN/ORC poll interviewed 1,001 Americans and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

4,POLITICS,We're Still In The Dark About Some Super PAC Donors,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disclosed-super-pac-donations_us_55d38968e4b07addcb445bb7,"Who's behind these groups, anyway?",2015-08-19,<p>Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d38e921d00006e0014526f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Super PACs, the political action committees fueling the early presidential advertising wars, are supposed to transparently disclose where their money comes from. But sometimes, that's not what happens.Take Tread Standard LLC's $150,000 contribution on June 17 to Right to Rise, the super PAC that has raised $103 million to support former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s presidential bid. Tread Standard LLC is almost completely anonymous. Registered in Delaware on April 30, the company provided no mailing address to Right to Rise, though it was required to do so. Who's behind this group, anyway?It wasn't supposed to be this way. The Supreme Court's controversial 2010 Citizens United decision paved the way for the now-ubiquitous super PACs, opening the door to unlimited corporate, union and individual contributions to election campaigns -- provided the donations are independent from candidates' own spending.Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy stated that ""With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters.""Yet just because super PACs must disclose their contributions to the Federal Election Commission doesn't mean it's possible to know who their donors are. Limited liability companies (LLCs), corporations, unions, nonprofit groups, and other non-human donors have already contributed tens of millions of dollars to super PACs.Shedding Light On Super PAC DonorsAn online search can sometimes trace super PAC donations back to a person or a known publicly traded or privately held corporation. But donors can still shroud their identities and keep the public in the dark by setting up an unidentifiable shell LLC.Tread Standard LLC’s donation is reminiscent of W Spann LLC's $1 million contribution to Restore Our Future, a pro-Mitt Romney super PAC. In that case, the media eventually figured out that former Bain Capital director Ed Conard created the anonymous shell company.Tracing barely identifiable companies or nonprofits' contributions back to their true source can reveal some interesting connections. Right to Rise, for example, has also received $100,000 from a Phoenix, Arizona, company named DFX LLC. Unlike Tread Standard LLC, this company did disclose an address: 3200 E. Camelback Rd., Suite 295, Phoenix, AZ, 85018.It turns out that DFX LLC shares its address with the Pivotal Group, a private equity and real estate investment firm headed by Republican Party donor Francis Najafi. So far this year, Najafi has given $2,700 to Bush’s campaign and $100,000 to America’s Liberty PAC, a super PAC supporting Sen. Rand Paul’s (R-Ky.) presidential campaign. The Pivotal Group declined to comment when asked whether DFX LLC was connected to anyone working there. Jasper Reserves LLC, a company registered to the address of the West Virginia law firm Bailey & Glasser, also made a $1 million donation to Right to Rise. Bloomberg Politics reported that coal billionaire Chris Cline was behind the donation. The PAC also received $100,000 from Walker Investments LLC, a company controlled by James E. Walker III, head of the Fir Tree Partners hedge fund.Meanwhile, Unintimidated PAC, which supports Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s presidential campaign, received $25,000 from a Boston business called New Media Investors SP, LLC -- a company that Jenzabar CEO Robert Maginn, the former head of the Massachusetts Republican Party, uses as an investment vehicle. Maginn has also personally donated $15,000 to Right to Rise and to a handful of Republican presidential candidates, including Bush, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Cruz.Similarly, Stand for Principle PAC, one of five super PACs supporting Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Texas) presidential campaign, raised almost all of its money from V3 231 LLC, a New Jersey-based company that gave it $250,000. Public records show that the company is tied to the Williamsburg, Brooklyn-based wireless entrepreneur and developer Chaim “Ben” Nash. Nash, a member of Brooklyn’s Hasidic Jewish community, previously ran a hotel property development company called V3 Hotels. That company worked to develop the property at 231 Duffield Street in Brooklyn that would later become Hotel Indigo. V3 231 LLC -- a combination of the development company’s name and Hotel Indigo's street address -- was a V3 Hotels subsidiary that developed that particular hotel property. The New York Times first reported Nash's connection to the donation on Monday. The pro-Marco Rubio Conservative Solutions PAC received $150,000 from Collum’s Administration & Maintenance LLC, a subsidiary of the family-owned South Carolina company Collum's Lumber. The PAC received an additional $200,000 from Travel Retail Group Holdings LLC. Guess who's behind that company? Benny Klepach, head of DFASS Group, the world's largest airline duty free travel store chain. Using Nonprofits To Avoid DisclosureSuper PACS can also get around disclosure by receiving contributions from nonprofits, which do not legally have to disclose their donors. Six-figure donations from the nonprofits Fair Share, Inc. and Environment America almost entirely funded a super PAC called Fair Share Action, which in turn gave $1 million to Priorities USA Action, according to the Associated Press.  The Huffington Post reported on Monday that the heads of the global investment firm Susquehanna International Group -- Jeffrey Yass, Arthur Dantchik and Joel Greenberg -- are behind a nonprofit called Green Orchard, which donated $100,000 to a super PAC that will likely support the re-election campaign of Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.).While it's possible to trace these contributions back to a human donor or a larger, more prominent company, nonprofits can also spend directly on elections, rather than contributing to super PACs.This so-called ""dark money"" exceeded $400 million in the 2012 election and, with presidential candidates linked to their very own non-disclosing nonprofits, will almost certainly rise further in 2016."

Or as the title of the video from the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy puts it -- White Shark 0: Seal 1. And for anyone already a little leery of swimming in the ocean, consider this: The entire incident took place just 30 feet from shore in less than 10 feet of water, the organization wrote on Facebook. The conservancy said that this is the first time they've seen a great white leap from the waters near Cape Cod during a hunt.The footage was filmed by Greg Skomal of the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries.“It’s really a testament to the speed and power that these animals can generate in such a short amount of space and time,” he told the Boston Globe of the super seal. “It was able to literally come out of the water. It’s really amazing.” The organization also posted a still photo showing the view from above: The conservancy told the Globe that sharks are often seen breaching off South Africa and other places, but they've never seen it happen like this off Cape Cod. “(The shark) just launched himself up without taking a running start. I’ve never seen it before,” Cynthia Wigren, president of the conservancy, told the paper. “We knew it was possible, but to watch it naturally occur in front of us and get it on video -- it all ended up really well.”The shark didn't go hungry for long. The organization said it later ate a different seal. (h/t Mediaite)Also on HuffPost:"
8,IMPACT,Cottages For Homeless People In Dallas Will Save Taxpayers About $1.3 Million,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cottages-for-homeless-will-save-dallas-taxpayers-about-13-million_us_55d4bc9ce4b0ab468d9f5765,"Dallas seems to have taken a cue from its neighbors in Houston on how to effectively tackle, and put an end to, chronic homelessness",2015-08-19,"<p>In November, 50 homeless individuals in Dallas will move into their own cottage in Dallas. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d4d0c5170000b700567fdf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dallas seems to have taken a cue from its neighbors in Houston on how to effectively tackle, and put an end to, chronic homelessness. Starting November, 50 chronically homeless individuals in Dallas will each move into their own cottages in a complex that comes with green recreational space, solar energy and rainwater collection, among other green features, according to the Corporation for Supportive Housing. Residents will also have access to skills training and mental and physical health services, the Dallas Morning News reported. In addition to giving homeless people a fresh start, the program will also save taxpayers a significant amount of funds.A homeless person who cycles through the prison system and emergency health services typically costs the county about $40,000 a year, Keith Ackerman, executive director of Cottages at Hickory Crossing, told HuffPost. This innovative housing program will bring those costs down to less than $13,000.That means about $1.3 million in total savings for taxpayers.While locals will likely feel elated, the drastic figures aren’t anything new.Numerous studies have found that “housing first,” which involves giving homeless people homes and then addressing their health and unemployment issues, is efficient and cost-effective.Since 2012, for example, a similar housing initiative in Charlotte has saved the city $2.4 million in medical costs alone.Moore Place, a Charlotte nonprofit, houses homeless people in its 85-unit complex and also provides its clients with a team of social workers, therapists, nurses and psychologists.Houston announced in June that it was able to end chronic veteran homelessness by bringing together a number of local agencies to house 3,650 veterans over the course of three years.Currently, the homeless population in Dallas is holding steady.On a single night in January, there were 3,141 homeless people, an increase of 1 percent from last year, according to the Metro Dallas Homeless Alliance. After six years of planning and development, the $8.2 million project broke ground in April, according to the Dallas Morning News. The initiative partnered with a number of groups, including CSH, which provided a $50,000 grant and a $50,000 loan, according to the group.The group has invited the public to get involved by purchasing items at Target to furnish the cottages and volunteering to serve as greeters to help the residents get settled. The development won the AIA Dallas Design Award in the unbuilt category for its plans to foster a healing environment. “This just makes sense,” Ron Stretcher, director of the Dallas County Criminal Justice Department, told the Dallas Morning News. “Everyone deserves a place to stay; we’re only as strong as the least among us. But even if you don’t subscribe to that, it’s cheaper to do this than to cycle them through the prisons and the jails and the emergency rooms.”"

India’s fourth-largest airport, the Cochin International Airport in the southern city of Kochi, announced on Tuesday that it is now “absolutely energy neutral,” The Economic Times reports. The airport is co-funded and operated by the Indian government through a public-private partnership. The airport’s energy neutrality is possible thanks to a 12-megawatt solar system consisting of more than 46,000 panels installed on a 50-acre site. The system can generate up to 60,000 units of electricity daily.According to Al Jazeera America, the project took six months to build and cost $10 million, which the airport anticipates it will recover within five years. The panels are expected to last 25 years.The panels were designed and installed by Bosch Ltd., which has a five-year partnership with the airport, according to Catch News. The airport began testing solar energy in March 2013, when it installed a small solar plant on the arrival terminal’s rooftop, according to The Economic Times. The project has been seen as a model for the rest of India, and the government is urging other airports to follow suit.India's goal is to ramp up solar capacity to 100 gigawatts by 2022. Its current capacity is four gigawatts.India has a broader goal to derive 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2022, with 3 percent coming exclusively from solar. Earlier this summer, the government rolled out new incentives to encourage developers to turn to renewable energy.Also on HuffPost:"
10,QUEER VOICES,"Conservative Christians Are Still Fighting Gay Marriage, But It's An Uphill Battle Against The Courts",Lila Shapiro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-christians-face-uphill-battle-in-same-sex-marriage-debate-after-string-of-losses_us_55d3b3cee4b07addcb4489cf,A recent string of losses doesn't bode well for the religious campaign.,2015-08-19,"Kim Davis, the Rowan County Clerk of Courts, listens to Robbie Blankenship and Jesse Cruz as they speak with her about getting a marriage license at the County Clerk's Office on September 2, 2015 in Morehead, Kentucky.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58653a411500002300916516.jpeg?cache=xGS34VLQug&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For more than 20 years, conservative Christians have been building the case that laws protecting gay people and legalizing same-sex marriage place an unconstitutional burden on the rights of religious people who believe homosexuality is a sin. Over the last decade, as same-sex marriage first crept, then swept, across the nation, the issue has become more pointed: Must Christian wedding vendors, photographers, bakers, florists and county clerks offer their services to same-sex couples in spite of their religious objections?So far, the courts appear unconflicted on this issue. Last week, conservative Christians suffered two more defeats in a nearly unbroken string of legal losses over the last decade.First came the ruling of Judge David L. Bunning of the U.S. District Court for Eastern Kentucky, who ordered Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis to issue state marriage licenses to all qualified couples who seek them. Davis is “certainly free to disagree with the Court’s decision, as many Americans likely do,” Bunning wrote, referring to the Supreme Court's decision legalizing gay marriage. “But that does not excuse her from complying with it.”Then, in Colorado, the Court of Appeals weighed in on a case that has been brewing since 2012, when David Mullins, Charlie Craig and Craig’s mother visited a bakery near their home and tried to buy a cake for a reception celebrating the couple’s upcoming marriage in Massachusetts. (At the time, Colorado did not recognize same-sex marriages.) Jack Phillips, the evangelical owner of the Masterpiece Cakeshop — who also won’t bake Halloween cookies or erotic pastries — told the couple he does not create wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of his religious beliefs. Phillips' legal team, the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian advocacy group based in Arizona, argued that Phillips' decision to turn down the couple was protected by the First Amendment. But the Colorado Court of Appeals disagreed. The bakery, like Kim Davis, “remains free to continue espousing its religious beliefs, including its opposition to same-sex marriage,” the court explained in its ruling last Thursday. However, if Phillips wishes to run the bakery as a public business, Colorado’s anti-discrimination law “prohibits it from picking and choosing customers based on their sexual orientation.”Both cases will likely be appealed to higher courts, but religious liberty experts see no indication that they will fare better there. These cases bring up a myriad of complex legal issues: Is issuing a marriage license, or declining to, protected speech? Is issuing a license a substantial burden on a person’s freedom of religion? Is baking a cake a form of artistic expression that is protected by free-speech rights? But so far, all of the arguments in favor of a religious individual’s right to refuse service to same-sex couples seeking to wed have failed in the courts.“What the courts are saying is that we have a new national norm that same-sex couples have an equal right to marry, and that trumps religious liberty rights in these contexts. Whether you’re in a business or a public official, you don’t get to pick and choose which laws you comply with,” said Katherine Franke, a professor at Columbia Law School who focuses on religious liberty. “What we risk is that individuals become a law unto themselves.” The religious advocacy groups arguing in favor of Masterpiece Cakeshop and Kim Davis see the risk in entirely different terms. “I want people like you and everybody else to just be able to live their lives in a way that's consistent with their beliefs,” said Jeremy Tedesco, senior legal counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom.Tedesco said that neither he nor his clients have anything against gay people, and that Phillips is happy to sell gay couples baked goods so long as the goods were not used in a wedding celebration. He also said that he supported the Denver baker who refused to bake a cake with “God hates gays” written on it. (The Colorado Civil Rights Division ruled that the bakery did not discriminate against William Jack, the Christian who requested the anti-gay cake.) “That’s the consequence of a free society,” he said. “You have to be able to live with those whose views you don’t like.”But his employer’s history of anti-gay advocacy tests Tedesco’s claim that this latest case is simply about protecting the First Amendment. The Alliance Defending Freedom, formerly called the Alliance Defense Fund, has pioneered the argument that gay rights are a direct threat to religious liberty since as far back as 1994, when ADF solicited funds on Christian radio with an ad claiming that ""Hiring homosexuals in Christian schools, churches, and even as Sunday School teachers may soon become the law of the land. ... Don't let Christianity become a crime."" In 2003, ADF president Alan Sears co-wrote a definitive text on the subject, The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing The Principle Threat To Religious Freedom Today, in which he argues that homosexuality and pedophilia are “intrinsically linked” and compares the gay “propaganda” movement to what ""Hitler did so masterfully in Nazi Germany, to get the American public on their side.”Despite last week’s losses, Todesco said he was optimistic that the courts would soon begin ruling in his favor. He pointed to a ruling in Kentucky this spring that determined that a Christian T-shirt company did not have to print shirts advertising a 2012 pride festival -- an outlier among the recent rulings. “That’s the right outcome,” he said. “For whatever reason right now the courts are not appreciating the arguments that we’ve been putting forth.”He didn't speculate as to what the reason might be, but he did say that he expected more lawsuits to be filed concerning Christian clerks and business owners and the same-sex couples they turn away. “We just want to live and let live,” he said. “Their attitude is, this town’s not big enough for the both of us.”Of course, couples turned away from wedding venues and county clerks' offices often say the same thing — the difference is that these couples sometimes have to actually leave their hometowns in order to wed. David Moore and his fiance David Ermold have lived in Rowan County, Kentucky, for 10 years. Last month, in a widely viewed video, County Clerk Kim Davis told them they can “go to any other county and get your marriage license, we’re just not doing it at this time.” After last week’s court ruling, they tried for a marriage license and were turned down again. This week, the judge issued a temporary stay on the ruling while the appeals process plays out.“Every time they tell us to leave, it feels like they’re telling us, ‘Don’t live here. Just leave. Your kind are not welcome here,’” Moore told the Huffington Post.He and Ermold have begun to talk about how long they'll wait before heading over to a neighboring county to get a license. After being turned away for a second time, Moore said that it's become clear to him that ""the other side will go as far as they can go with this. Our plan is to fight this as far as we can go, too. But at the same time, we have lives, we have jobs, and we want to get on with our lives."""
