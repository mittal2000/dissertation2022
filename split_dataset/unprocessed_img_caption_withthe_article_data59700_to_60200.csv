1,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Donald Trump And Hillary Clinton Are Struggling With Some Female Voters,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-clinton-female-voters_us_570ce8bee4b0885fb50e23b1,But they’re facing challenges for different reasons.,2016-04-12,http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iNHyVTv_0aGg/v1/-1x-1.jpg,http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iNHyVTv_0aGg/v1/-1x-1.jpg,"Donald Trump is strongly disliked by married women, while Hillary Clinton struggles to pick up support from young women. Few Republicans plan to vote for Hillary Clinton in November, regardless of the GOP nominee. And President Obama’s approval ratings are staying out of the red. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, April 12, 2016. MARRIED WOMEN DISLIKE TRUMP - Mark Niquette: ""Seventy percent of married women who are likely general-election voters have an unfavorable opinion of the Republican front-runner, according to the Purple Slice online poll conducted by Purple Strategies for Bloomberg Politics. Almost 60 percent said the way Trump talks about women is offensive and embarrassing and makes him unacceptable as a presidential candidate, and more than half said the billionaire is setting a new low in negativity….Women, particularly single women, tend to vote Democratic, but the married women subset has leaned more Republican. In the 2012 election, married women preferred Mitt Romney over President Barack Obama 53 percent to 46 percent, and since 1996 Republican presidential candidates have won the married women vote, according to Gallup….In a general-election match-up, the Democratic front-runner defeats Trump 48 percent to 36 percent, while against Texas Senator Ted Cruz, she is in a tie at 43 percent."" [Bloomberg] FEMALE VOTERS' AGE GAP ON CLINTON IS DRIVEN BY LIFE EXPERIENCES - Lori Poloni-Staudinger, J. Cherie Strachan and Brian Schaffner: ""Clinton hasn’t resonated much with young voters, including young women. In fact, Sanders beats Clinton among young voters overall by as much as 60 points, while Clinton loses young women by about 30 points….Democratic women who said they had been discriminated against because of gender were more likely to choose Clinton over Sanders, even after accounting for ideology, age and income….Older women are more likely to report that their education or career had been affected by gender discrimination and caring for children….In most age groups, Clinton supporters report higher levels of child-care responsibilities limiting their choices than do their comparable Sanders supporters….Fewer younger women have seen their prospects limited by discrimination and child-care responsibilities. Here’s what they have faced personally: being part of the generation hardest hit by the Great Recession, and seeing student debt and poor job prospects as major career obstacles."" [WashPost] FEW REPUBLICANS SAY THEY’D VOTE FOR CLINTON - Hannah Hartig and Stephanie Psyllos: “[A]ccording to the latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll...When given the choice between Clinton, Cruz, a third party candidate, or not voting, registered voters are fairly split between Clinton and Cruz... When asked about Trump as the GOP nominee in November instead of Cruz, registered voters are split between Clinton and Trump, though the race is tighter...[O]nly about half of Cruz supporters and half of Trump supporters said they would vote for the other GOP candidate in a general election... In a theoretical November contest wherein Clinton and Trump were the candidates, 56 percent of Cruz supporters would vote for Trump and a quarter would vote for a third party candidate. Similarly, 53 percent of Trump supporters would vote for Cruz and 28 percent would vote for a third party candidate if their options in November were between Clinton and Cruz.” [NBC]General election matchups are still hypothetical - Both parties are still in the midst of a primary election fight. It’s fairly clear what the outcome will be on the Democratic side, but the Republicans could battle all the way to the convention. Until the nominees are set, general election polls remain hypothetical and not predictive of what could happen in the fall. TRUMP IS WEAKEST CANDIDATE IN MODERN HISTORY - Harry Enten: ""Trump’s 37 percent of the cumulative primary vote and 46 percent of delegates won so far may sound impressive, but his percentages make him the weakest Republican front-runner, at this point in the process, in decades. Of course, a front-runner is still a front-runner, but by historical standards Trump is limping along — hence the increased chances of a contested convention….Past GOP nominees...had bigger shares of the vote at this point, even if they started out slowly….You’ll also note that past nominees tended to increase their delegate and vote leads from this point forward, mostly because their rivals had faded or dropped out...Trump isn’t so lucky. Ted Cruz is almost certainly going to fight hard all the way to the last primaries on June 7 and beyond."" [538] OBAMA’S APPROVAL CONTINUES TO RISE - Kathleen Hennessey and Emily Swanson - “As many in the United States hold their noses in the search for the next president, they're increasingly warming to the president they already have. Buoyed by some good economic news and a surge of goodwill from his base of supporters, President Barack Obama is seeing his approval rating rise….For the first time since 2013, half of those questioned approve of the job Obama is doing in office, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll. The survey found the apparent uptick in approval extended across issues, including foreign affairs, immigration and, most notably the economy, where people said they felt slightly better about their own prospects and Obama's stewardship. Asked about their opinion of Obama more generally, those surveyed were more likely to give him a positive rating than any of the candidates for president, Republican or Democrat.” [AP]The president's average rating tops 50 percent - HuffPost Pollster’s chart of all publicly available polling has shown Obama's positive ratings rising since December. His approval rating now stands at approximately 50 percent mark, a point last achieved in February of 2013. The uptick is mirrored in his ratings among Democrats and independents, and he’s even up a tiny bit among Republicans, where his 13 percent approval is up from 10 percent in late 2015.

Time,"" de Blasio said, referring to the phrase ""colored people's time,"" an in-joke used to indicate chronic lateness but also viewed as a negative stereotype.""I don't like jokes like that,"" Odom said, apparently as part of the skit.Clinton then delivered the punchline: ""'Cautious politician time,'"" she said. ""I've been there.""The joke set off angry reactions on social media with commentators criticizing Clinton, who has strong support from black voters, and de Blasio, whose wife Chirlane McCray is African-American, for insensitivity.Despite opinion polls showing Clinton has overwhelming support among African Americans heading into New York state's Democratic primary next Tuesday, some supporters worry her challenger Bernie Sanders has begun making inroads.De Blasio, who was Clinton's campaign manager in her successful election to the U.S. Senate in 2000, defended the joke in an appearance on CNN on Monday. ""It was clearly a staged show,"" he said. ""I think people are missing the point here.""In a statement on Monday, the mayor's office said, ""Let's be clear, in an evening of satire, the only person this was meant to mock was the mayor himself - period. Certainly no one intended to offend anyone.""In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine, Clinton distanced herself from the skit.""Well, look, it was Mayor de Blasio's skit,"" she was quoted as saying. ""He has addressed it, and I will really defer to him because it is something that he's already talked about.""(Reporting by Barbara Goldberg and Joseph Ax; Editing by Bill Trott and Howard Goller)"
3,TECH,"Facebook, Microsoft Pay Men And Women Equally -- But There's Still A Big Problem",Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/microsoft-facebook-gender-pay-gap_us_570d0591e4b01422324a1d4c,A pay gap is the least of their worries.,2016-04-12,"Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, is a pioneer of workplace equality.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570d07ab150000ee010b4a13.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Facebook and Microsoft both made substantial commitments to equal pay on Monday, stating in two separate announcements that they've closed gaps between the salaries of men and women at their companies.The timing isn't coincidental: Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, which exists to highlight the gender pay gap.""I'm proud to share that at Facebook, men and women earn the same,"" Lori Goler, Facebook's head of human resources, said via status update on the social network.Microsoft's update, written by Kathleen Hogan, the company's executive vice president for HR, was a bit more nuanced. Hogan announced that women at Microsoft earn 99.8 cents to every $1 men earn at the same level and job title. Meanwhile, minorities are said to have completely equal pay overall to Caucasian workers at Microsoft.It's good news, but it masks a problem.Men and women may get paid equally according to title at Microsoft and Facebook, but women are overwhelmingly less likely to hold positions at these companies. Microsoft is particularly male-dominated, with 73.1 percent of all roles held by men and 26.8 percent held by women, according to the company's own diversity numbers. Facebook is 68 percent male and 32 percent female overall.And the numbers are substantially worse when you look at tech jobs, like engineering or product development. It is there that women are most outnumbered by male peers: At Facebook, a pitiful 16 percent of tech jobs are held by women. Microsoft is no better, with 16.9 percent of tech positions occupied by females.The common refrain for people who don't believe gender inequality in tech is a problem is usually that women simply aren't interested in tech roles. That's nonsense on the basis that women, too, are human beings with diverse experiences and interests -- we men should not be more entitled to jobs in the tech industry simply because someone gave us a Game Boy when we were three years old while our female peers got a Barbie.But that's exactly what happens. The bias solidifies over years and, at best, manifests in online comments about the gender divide, as you can see below. At worst, the comments are made in the workplace, in classrooms or job interviews.Companies carry much of the burden when it comes to more diverse hires. Intel, another tech company, is showing how possible it is to successfully commit to hiring more women and minorities by overhauling an outdated job interview and referral process. For example, employees get double the referral bonus for diverse candidates. The company has also mandated that at least one woman and one underrepresented minority must be interviewed for each open position.It should go without saying why this is a good idea: Diverse perspectives lead to better products and would probably help companies like Microsoft avoid embarrassing and offensive promotions (at the very least). Pragmatically, white men obviously aren't the only ones using products from the likes of Facebook and Microsoft -- so why are they mostly the ones making those products?Still, the onus isn't just on these tech companies. There's a systemic problem that cuts many people off from opportunities early on, which helps ensure that only the most privileged people wind up at these tech companies or receiving computer science education at all. While companies can and should do a lot more to support diverse hires, there's a shared burden for the rest of us to urge progress along, too."

He also said he wanted to fire his court-appointed lawyers and defend himself.Martinez ordered the South Carolina native to undergo a competency examination at the state mental hospital to determine if he was fit to act as his own lawyer.The court-appointed evaluation deemed him incompetent, his lawyers said in court filings.In an interview with the Colorado Springs Gazette newspaper last month, Dear indicated that he may have changed his mind and might not fire his lawyers.""Yeah, I want to be my own attorney,"" Dear told the newspaper. ""But if my attorney will start following my rules and doing what I want, then maybe I'll work a deal with him.”Martinez will rule whether Dear is competent sometime after an April 28 hearing on the issue."
5,POLITICS,"To Turn Around The Drug War, GOP Senator Wants To Bring Back The Egg",Ryan Grim and Amber Ferguson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rob-johnson-drug-war-egg_us_570d0bd5e4b01422324a2091,This is your Senate on drugs.,2016-04-12,The egg that Ron Johnson wants to see refried has become an iconic part of the drug-war debate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570d0d4b1e0000b300706ce3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ron Johnson has an idea. And it couldn't have come a moment too soon. With the opioid epidemic raging throughout the country and in his home state of Wisconsin, the Republican senator, who earlier this year voted against increased funding to address the crisis, is entering the policy fray with a suggestion we can only assume is a serious one: Refry that egg, man.Any questions?Johnson married into a plastics fortune. He and his brother-in-law ran a spinoff plastics company that began in the late 1970s by selling exclusively to his father-in-law's global company, and that has since grown to become a sizable firm. Johnson says he launched his Senate race after watching Dick Morris on Fox News call for a “rich guy” to challenge then-incumbent Russ Feingold. He claimed to have self-financed the campaign at a cost of $9 million. After his election, his company gave him a lump-sum payment of $10 million.He is now using his position to raise the banner of the drug war. In a previously overlooked interview, Johnson offered his refried-egg idea after a host of AM 1130's ""Up and At 'Em"" made the point that after waging war on drugs, there are still, nevertheless, drugs. ""Now, senator, I don’t know how many billions, maybe trillions spent on the war on drugs, and there’s still a lot of drugs,"" the host said. ""How do you solve that and how do you stop drugs from coming across the border?""""Well, let's find an area of agreement,"" Johnson said during the December radio interview. ""You know, when I was down there Gen. Kelly posed the question to me, 'You know, senator, when’s the last time we've had a concerted national public relations education campaign to try and dissuade Americans, particularly young people, from taking drugs?'""""And I thought back to Nancy Reagan, 'Just Say No,'"" he continued, ""and then a few years later they had that famous commercial with, you know, a pan with a couple eggs and there’s your brain and scramble them up and there’s your brain on drugs. Well, why don’t we first do something like that? Let's try to dissuade our young people.""A month earlier, speaking on WIBA's ""Vicki McKenna Show,"" he lamented that such eggy ads were not cool. “It takes concerted effort but education, information is important and so we -- we gave up after the '80s. I guess it wasn't cool to have an informational war on drugs. I think we need to start that informational war on drugs,"" he proposed.Johnson's favorite anti-drug ad may no longer be in rotation on the airwaves, but it has attained iconic status as a singular example of the futility of the 1980s-era approach. It has also been memorialized in countless headlines -- This Is Your [Fill In The Blank] On Drugs -- and even in the title of one book on the history of the drug war. (Objectively speaking, it's a great book, though somehow it has only garnered a 3.7 on GoodReads. Ah well. No accounting for taste.)Johnson, a high-profile critic of ""The Lego Movie,"" is trailing Feingold in multiple polls, and may not get the chance in 2017 to wage his informational war on drugs.This story has been updated to clarify Johnson's role with the plastics company.If you thought ""The Lego Movie"" was OK, sign up here to get Ryan Grim's newsletter, a semi-regular dispatch about politics and the drug war.

The actor, who was with his ""Story of Your Life"" co-star Amy Adams, also said that he'd chosen his upcoming movie role ""because of this awesome woman standing next to me."" And while it's all good and nice that Renner is voicing a noticeably different tune than last year, his statements ring a little insincere. Probably because it's coming from a man who openly commented on Jennifer Lopez's breasts at the 2015 Golden Globes, called Scarlett Johansson’s character Black Widow a ""slut"" and a ""whore"" (before offering up a bad apology) and said that it's ""not his job"" to help female co-stars negotiate their salaries.

14,BUSINESS,Aetna's CEO Proves You Can Prioritize People And Still Earn A Huge Profit,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mark-bertolini-pay-aetna_us_570bc88fe4b0142232497fdc,"Mark Bertolini is an ""unconventional boss"" who is ""mindful of morality."" And that's great for business.",2016-04-12,"A survey of 474 executives found that most companies fall into three categories with respect to purpose: prioritizers, companies that already have a clearly articulated and understood purpose (39 percent); developers, companies that do not yet have a clearly articulated purpose but are working to develop one (48 percent); and laggards, companies that have not yet begun to develop or even think about purpose (13 percent).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570d1a0b1e00008700706d17.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Aetna's Mark Bertolini isn't the kind of chief executive you typically find in the elite group of Fortune 50 companies.He talks openly about his personal health struggles. He evangelizes a healthful culture, and encourages his employees to meditate and practice yoga. After reading French economist Thomas Piketty's blockbuster book on income inequality, he actually raised the minimum wage at his health insurance giant to $16 an hour. He promised to pay his employees up to $300 a year in extra cash just for getting plenty of sleep. But he certainly gets paid like a top-brass executive. Last year, Aetna bumped Bertolini's compensation to $17.3 million -- higher stock options and awards bumped this from the $15.1 million in 2014, according to a proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Bertolini earned a base salary of about $1 million, with a bonus of $1.84 million. ""In 2015, Aetna had record operating earnings and record operating revenues, and the company's total return to shareholders was 23 percent,"" company spokesman T.J. Crawford told The Huffington Post by email. ""Mark continues to be a recognized thought leader for his efforts to transform the health care system and on important social policy issues.""Ninety-four percent of Bertolini's compensation was tied to the company's financial performance, Crawford said. Aetna has a market capitalization of $37.6 billion. It's waiting for federal regulators to greenlight a $37 billion merger with rival Humana, which would be the largest insurance deal in history. In February, its fourth-quarter profits rose 38 percent as operating revenue increased 2.2 percent to $15.09 billion.But that alone didn't get Bertolini on Fortune magazine's list of the world's 50 greatest leaders last year. Over the last decade, two near-death experiences -- his own skiing accident and his young son's battle with a rare form of cancer -- transformed him into someone the business press has called an ""unconventional boss"" who is “mindful of morality.""“What I found very quickly in both his circumstance and mine was getting our lives back, becoming engaged and productive members of society, was something that the health care system cared very little about,” Bertolini said about himself and his son in a recent interview with HuffPost. That perspective shaped his leadership style and convinced him to focus on a bigger picture. “We view stock price and compensation as ways of measuring the success of an organization, and I think, because of that, we have a very short-term view of how capitalism works,” he said. “At Aetna, we actually say, ‘You know what, we’re here for the long run. Here are the fundamentals we’re investing in, like we did with our employees.’” Bertolini declined to comment for this story.Companies with a clearly articulated purpose tend to outperform firms without one. A global survey of 474 executives, conducted last year by Ernst & Young and the Harvard Business Review, found that 58 percent of leaders who prioritized purpose had seen their companies grow by 10 percent or more in the last three years. By contrast, only 42 percent of the executives who reported lagging behind on imbuing their companies with meaning saw similar double-digit growth. ""This is a powerful signal of how pioneer CEOs are driving value by values,"" Valerie Keller, strategy executive director and global leader of Ernst & Young's Beacon Institute, wrote in an email on Tuesday. ""This is also an answer to the tired debate of ‘does purpose drive profits?’ Clearly, yes. Benefit for society equals benefits for shareholders equals benefits for executives.""Still, the pay bump may draw some heat from those who criticize astronomical pay for chief executives. The CEOs of the top 350 public-traded companies earn more than 300 times what average workers do, according to a study released last year by the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute. ""In a political and socioeconomic climate where inequality is rampant and executive compensation is targeted, it would be easy for people to take pot-shots at this,"" Keller said. ""But let’s not miss the underlying point: When global CEOs are rewarded for driving value for a wider set of stakeholders -- and that is in turn seen as driving value for shareholders -- it is a powerful proof point for all those advocating ‘conscious capitalism’ and sustainable growth. More, please."""
15,POLITICS,Flint's Water Still Has Too Much Lead,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-water-lead_us_570d1a35e4b01422324a3361,"Things are getting better, but it's still not safe to drink from the tap.",2016-04-12,"Virginia Tech environmental engineering professor Marc Edwards testifies before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, in Washington, Tuesday, March 15, 2016, to examine the ongoing lead water crisis in Flint, Michigan.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_148_5184_2893%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Six months after the government told people in Flint, Michigan, to use bottled water for drinking and cooking, new research shows that what's coming out of their taps remains unfit for human consumption.A recent round of sampling shows lower levels of poisonous lead contaminating Flint's water, but the amount of lead is still above what the Environmental Protection Agency considers acceptable for a public water system. ""People have to continue using bottled water and filters until further notice,"" Marc Edwards, the Virginia Tech researcher who led the sampling effort, said Tuesday morning at a press conference at the university. Lead is a handy pipe material that also happens to be a deadly neurotoxin. In Flint and other American cities where lead has been used for water pipes, the toxic metal can contaminate the water, exposing people who drink from the tap to a range of health problems -- including irreversible IQ loss in children. For a public water system to be in compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA says it has to have lead levels below 15 parts per billion in 90 percent of samples taken. In March, Edwards' team found 22.8 parts per billion of lead in Flint's ""90th percentile"" sample. That's down from 28.5 parts per billion in August, but still above the EPA's limit. (Being below the limit doesn't necessarily mean the water is safe from lead.)Last month Gov. Rick Snyder (R) touted the state's own testing results, which found that 91 percent of samples were beneath the federal limit, an improvement from the state's previous round of testing.""We have always said that based on our testing, concerns still exist,"" Snyder spokesman Ari Adler said in a Tuesday email, adding that the governor is grateful for Edwards' work. ""It appears that many of their findings and recommendations track with what the state is seeing but we are continuing to test the water in Flint and are working to restore the system in terms of stability,"" Adler said.The EPA also collected Flint water samples earlier this year, though it hasn't published ""90th percentile"" findings like Edwards and the state of Michigan have. Snyder's office said last week that federal, state and independent testing efforts all show improvement in Flint's water, though not enough for people to start drinking it. Edwards and his graduate students first teamed up with Flint residents last summer to investigate Flint's water while the local, state and federal governments downplayed his concerns about its lead content. Since being proven right, Snyder has made Edwards one of his top water consultants, and the EPA funded his recent round of testing.Flint's water soured after Snyder's government oversaw the city's switch to the Flint River as its source, then failed to treat the river water with anti-corrosion chemicals. Corrosion control treatment is something large public water systems are always supposed to do in order to prevent corrosive materials from leaching lead out of pipes and home plumbing materials. Flint started adding extra corrosion controls to its water in December, two months after Snyder approved the city's return to the Detroit water system. On Tuesday, Edwards said his team's samples showed that the corrosion controls were working -- that they were successfully rebuilding the interior coating that services as a barrier between water and the pipe surface.But Edwards noted that because Flint residents have been using much less tap water, it's taking longer than it normally would to flush out deposits of lead and rust that discolors the water. Edwards suggested Flint residents could help the system by running their taps, something Snyder's office also recommended last week. ""We have learned in the past few months it's going to take months or years to get these deposits out of the pipes,"" Edwards said. ""If we want to get the system to recover, we have to get water moving through the pipes to speed up the rate at which these loose deposits are removed into the water.""Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect that the EPA has published some data related to its sampling in Flint, but has not released any conclusions."
16,TECH,Facebook's Vision For The Future Might Demolish Business As You Know It,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-messenger-chatbots_us_570d2da1e4b0885fb50e5995,The bots are coming.,2016-04-12,"A chatbot for 1-800-Flowers.com takes your message via Facebook Messenger, so you never have to interact with an actual person.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570d34f02e00006400951149.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mark Zuckerberg described a new vision for Facebook's Messenger app Tuesday -- and if you work as a telephone customer service rep, you're going to want to sit down.As expected, the Facebook CEO unveiled new functionality for the popular messaging app that he says will allow businesses to develop ""chatbots"" that automatically serve customers. The overall idea is for the app's 800 million users to interact with businesses without actually needing to talk to -- ick! -- human beings.Zuckerberg's announcement came during a keynote speech at the F8 Developer Conference, where Facebook unveils new technologies for engineers to work with.""You probably interact with dozens of businesses a day, and some of them are probably very meaningful to you,"" he said. ""But I've never met anyone who likes calling a business.""The pitch is a natural one to make for the CEO. He's said many times that Facebook's goal is to connect the entire world, and he claimed Tuesday that 60 billion messages are sent every day via the company's Messenger and WhatsApp programs. But a connected world doesn't necessarily need phone numbers.In theory, chatbots on Messenger would allow businesses to provide customer service without involving human workers. If you wanted to reach out to a business, you could do so via your Messenger app, rather than by looking up a phone number and calling.For example, Facebook showed off a chatbot for 1-800-Flowers.com that automatically takes orders via Messenger. It says things like: ""White is a great choice! What is the recipient's name?"" You can tell the bot what you want the note on the delivery to say.""To order from 1-800-Flowers, you never have to call 1-800-Flowers again,"" Zuckerberg said with a laugh.As another example, a CNN bot displayed at the conference provides news updates according to requests, not unlike the new app from Quartz.In fairness, a lot of existing customer service features are already automated to some extent. Ordering flowers via Messenger is barely different from going to the 1-800-Flowers website and manually typing in your order -- chances are, many people have already given up on the idea of using the company's phone number. And of course you can already see the news without a human anchor reading it to you.Still, make no mistake: Facebook is looking to plant a flag. If one thing was painfully clear from the company's press event, it's that Zuckerberg's ambition is for Facebook to own how people communicate with one another. He spoke not just about how Messenger can disrupt customer service, but also about planes the company is building to beam Internet service down to remote areas -- along with drones that can broadcast footage via Facebook's live video platform. But don't panic yet. The technology is impressive, but tech companies are still mastering the tricky art of relating to people as human beings, as Microsoft recently learned the hard way. The company's ""Tay"" chatbot went live on Twitter late in March -- and was quickly pulled down after it went on a vicious anti-Semitic and misogynistic rampage. Until the kinks are worked out, you can rest assured that humanity still has a few good years left."

Richardson was being seen for his asthma, as well as chronic joint pain. Without insurance Richardson says he goes to Denver Health when he needs medical attention. The hospital is partially compensated for the treatment by CICP, Colorado Indigent Care Program. Richardson,a construction worker, has not been able to find steady work for the past year - due to his condition. The state Medicaid office enrolls 3,000 new members a month for health aid to low-income residents, a rate a spokeswoman calls 'astronomical' and unprecedented in the program's history. Denver Health, the prime urban outlet for residents lacking health insurance, saw 1,500 new uninsured patients in December, eight more patients a day than a year ago. (Craig F.

But underserved groups often have higher life expectancies in wealthy cities, demonstrating that the vicious trend can be broken, a new study concluded.A report published in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that the rich are living longer regardless of where they settle down. The richest men in America live 15 years longer than the poorest men, and the most affluent women live a decade more than the poorest women.But the length of a poor person’s life in the U.S. is heavily determined by their zip code, the study found.The researchers analyzed data from 1.4 billion anonymous earnings and mortality records from 1999 to 2014.They found that giving more money to poor people and increasing their access to health care isn’t “strongly associated” with higher life expectancies, as might be expected. Rather, exposing underserved people to programs that encourage healthy behaviors, like exercising and quitting smoking, significantly increases longevity.Poorer people have the lowest life expectancy in Nevada. It’s highest in New York, California and Vermont.For example, a poor person in New York is expected to live six years longer than a poor person in Detroit.Some experts say it’s New York’s nutrition and health policies that have helped improve longevity.Mayor Michael Bloomberg was both lauded and loathed for implementing such policies. He called for including calories on menus and enforcing higher taxes on cigarettes, The Washington Post pointed out""It's no coincidence that New York City banned trans fats,"" David Cutler, Harvard economist and co-author of the study, told The Post. ""New York is a very rich city. People there feel like, 'Look, socially it’s not doing anything for us, we know it’s harmful. Why not get rid of it?'""San Francisco has done its part by banning smoking in businesses, restaurants and other public places. It’s also developed parks and bike lanes, which promote exercise, and poured money into wellness programs, like the Center for Youth Wellness, which helps low-income youth grapple with the “toxic stress,” they’re exposed to.Such programs rarely exist for poor people outside of affluent cities.Lacking mental health treatment is one of the reasons why poor people often make ""bad choices,"" Linda Tirado, an activist, outlined in a 2013 essay that went viral.“Nobody gives enough thought to depression,” Tirado wrote in her blog post. “You have to understand that we know that we will never not feel tired. We will never feel hopeful. We will never get a vacation. Ever. We know that the very act of being poor guarantees that we will never not be poor. It doesn’t give us much reason to improve ourselves. We don’t apply for jobs because we know we can’t afford to look nice enough to hold them.”However, smaller cities are just as capable of developing programs that foster healthier lifestyles for poor people.Life expectancy rates for low-income residents in Birmingham, Ala., for example, rose from 2001 to 2014.In the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the county opened clinics in poorer neighborhoods that provide vaccinations and mammograms, The New York Times reported. It’s banned smoking in restaurants and workplaces and with the help of philanthropic funds, the county has developed campaigns to encourage people to get healthier. And a portion of local taxes funds hospital care for people who can’t afford it.The authors noted that while some of the statistics are bleak, they shouldn’t be discouraging.Government leaders should look toward the areas that have had improved figures and recreate those programs.“Our findings show that disparities in life expectancy are not inevitable,” the report concluded. “There are cities throughout America — from New York to San Francisco to Birmingham, AL — where gaps in life expectancy are relatively small or are narrowing over time. Replicating these successes more broadly will require targeted local efforts, focusing on improving health behaviors among the poor.”"

John Kasich (R) on Tuesday unleashed a pointed critique of his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, ridiculing their proposals and calling them unworthy of the office of president.Kasich, who has stubbornly refrained from criticizing Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in recent weeks, broached the subject in an address in New York City in which he urged Americans not to go down a ""path to darkness."" While he did not mention the two men directly by name, he took issue with some of their greatest hits: a ban on Muslims from entering the country, surveillance of Muslims in the U.S., dropping out of the NATO alliance, allowing nuclear weapons in Europe, and promising to repeal Obamacare ""simply through the will of a strong man in the White House.""""I have stood on a stage and watched with amazement as candidates wallowed in the mud, viciously attacked one another, called each other liars and disparaged each other's character. Those who continuously push that type of behavior are not worthy of the office they are seeking,"" Kasich said at a campaign event in Manhattan.The Ohio governor also laid into Trump for dividing Americans by religion and skin color. ""The response for some is to retreat into the past — to yearn for 'the way things used to be,'"" he said. ""To these people, today’s America is only seen as a broken place, and the people who did the breaking are 'the other': people with more money — or less money, people with different-sounding last names, or different religious beliefs, or different colored skin or lifestyles or — whatever."" Kasich badly trails both Trump and Cruz in crucial delegates needed to secure the party's nomination in Cleveland later this summer. His chances in doing so before the convention are basically zero, leading some to question his decision to remain in the race. Last month, the governor shot down the prospect of serving as vice president. Trump, however, named him as a possible ticket-mate on Monday. "

But her daughter found out anyway, thanks to her smartphone.""At that moment, it felt ridiculous to me, and irresponsible as a parent and as a citizen, that I was not doing something to prevent gun violence,"" Moore wrote. ""Simply keeping the news away from my child was putting my head in the sand. I wasn’t helping her, or anyone else, by doing that.""In her essay, Moore encouraged people to join Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun safety advocacy group co-founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Other celebrities that have teamed up with Everytown include comedian Amy Schumer and actresses Sofia Vergara and Jennifer Aniston.Moore also said she asked others to join the Everytown Creative Council, ""a bunch of actors and artists eager to spread the word and take action against gun violence.""""Where guns are concerned, it is not a good-guy-versus-bad-guy argument. It should not be a partisan argument. It should not be a pro-gun-versus-anti-gun argument. It is not an argument about our Constitution,"" she wrote. ""The Second Amendment protects the right of a United States citizen to bear arms. But a gun is a machine. And if you choose to bear arms, you have a responsibility to bear them safely."""

""However, in this situation, we believe that the extent of the response was absolutely unwarranted.""In the half-minute video, shot by an unidentified student at Rhodes Middle School on March 29, Kehm is seen grappling with the student, Janissa Valdez, in a school hallway, picking her up and throwing her to the ground.The girl lies motionless while the officer handcuffs her. She then gets up and is led away by the officer. The video does not show what led up to the incident or what followed.Martinez said Kehm produced an ""inconsistent"" police report. School district officials said the Texas Rangers, a statewide police agency, is also looking into the matter.""We want to be clear. We will not tolerate this behavior,"" Martinez said.Kehm has declined to comment on the incident.Bexar County District Attorney Nico LaHood says his office is also conducting an investigation to determine if criminal charges are warranted.The video has fed into a national debate over the role of police in schools and the proper procedure for dealing with unruly pupils by school officials.Almost 31,000 police officers are at U.S. public schools, according to the U.S. Department of Education, and incidents of violence by officers in schools, especially against minorities, have raised concerns.

23,WOMEN,John Kasich Is Seemingly Baffled By Young Women Who Get Politics,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kasich-is-seemingly-baffled-by-young-women-who-get-politics_us_570c07fde4b0836057a2153c,"No, sir, they don't want T-Swift tickets, they want answers.",2016-04-12,The face of a man who has not quite realized ladies are sentient beings.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570c0e001e00008700706bf4.jpeg?cache=XM8VnBe3Ke&ops=crop_19_112_2981_1909%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"John Kasich just can't seem to wrap his mind around the idea that young women are engaged participants in the political process. During a campaign event on Monday, the GOP presidential candidate took a question from a young woman who asked about social security. ""Did somebody tell you to ask this question?,"" inquired Kasich. ""No,"" she responded. ""I think for myself.""ABC political reporter Ben Gittleson, who was at the event, tweeted that Kasich seemed ""surprised"" at the young woman's question.One might be able to excuse this instance of Kasich's condescension as a misguided attempt at lightheartedness. But this isn't the first time he has put his foot in his mouth during an interaction with interested, thoughtful political constituents, who also happen to be young and female.In October, University of Richmond student Kayla Solsbak raised her hand enthusiastically to ask Kasich a question about his proposed policies on undocumented immigrants. “I’m sorry, I don’t have any Taylor Swift concert tickets,” he said when he eventually acknowledged her. Because, obviously, college women only attend political town halls in the hopes that there might be a secret T-Swift ticket giveaway at the end! Oh, Johnny John John. Solsbak responded by writing a thoughtful essay where she clarified: ""I didn’t go to a town hall forum for Taylor Swift tickets, Gov. Kasich. I went because it’s my civic duty to be an informed voter."" Watch a clip of the exchange, here:Millennial women have been belittled on the political stage time and time again. We've been dismissed as ""Beyoncé voters."" We've been told to go on Tinder instead of getting out to the polls. One time, a conservative SuperPAC suggested that we're all Obama's girlfriends who all need to break up with him. Charming.The young women I know on both sides of the political aisle are dynamic, engaged and opinionated. They have a thirst for political knowledge, because the results of elections, both national and local, have real implications on their lives. Young women are facing down crippling levels of college debt. They are seeing their reproductive rights and their access to health care under attack. They are wondering how they will fare in the job market. They are thinking about gun control and climate change and terrorism and racial inequality and the wage gap. They want to see their ideas -- and their lives -- taken seriously by the politicians who represent them.Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that Kasich's opinion of older women is any better. After all, this is the man who bragged that women once ""left their kitchens"" to elect him and defunded Planned Parenthood in Ohio just this past February.It should be obvious to politicians that alienating women -- especially young women, who will be voting for years and years to come -- is a pretty short-sighted move. After all, unmarried women are becoming an increasingly powerful political force. And politicians would do well to start paying attention to them. (Read this excerpt from Rebecca Traister's fantastic book All The Single Ladies to learn more about how the changing demographics of our country are dovetailing with louder calls for equal pay, family leave, child care and accessible health care.) As Traister wrote in October: ""Free advice to everyone in presidential politics: If you want young women to vote for you, stop treating them like dumbbells.""If politicians like Kasich continue to ignore that advice, their condescension may catch up with them on election day. In the indominatble words of William Shakespeare: ""Though she be but little, she is fierce."""
