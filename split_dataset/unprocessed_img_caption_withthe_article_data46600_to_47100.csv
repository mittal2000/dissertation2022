1,POLITICS,Trump Takes His Campaign To Manhattan,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-new-york-campaign_us_57d09eebe4b0a48094a780ac,"In final sprint, the GOP nominee spends some time with voters in a state he’s certain to lose.",2016-09-08,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump spent part of his Wednesday in deeply Democratic New York City, where he promised about 200 Conservative Party of New York delegates that he would campaign in the state with the intention of winning.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d0a01c160000ef1bc014db.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Struggling in key states and getting beaten in the money race, Donald Trump nevertheless spent part of his Wednesday campaigning in his home city and state, which almost certainly will go for his Democratic opponent in November.“Just so you understand, we are going to play in New York, we’re not just doing this for fun,” Trump promised about 200 delegates to the Conservative Party of New York’s convention that earlier had officially made Trump their nominee. “States are in play that are never in play for Republicans.”It’s unclear which states Trump was referring to ― a number of traditionally GOP states are currently in play, but not the other way around ― and Trump did not elaborate.The endorsement by the Conservative Party is not particularly unexpected. While the group fields candidates in local and state races, it generally lines up behind the Republican presidential nominee as a matter of course, delegates said.Unlike recent events in Mississippi, Texas and Washington state, where Trump staged big rallies, Wednesday night’s appearance at the Conservative Party gathering did not consume much time or money. Trump was in New York City anyway to participate in an MSNBC candidates forum, and merely spent about an hour visiting an event that was happening already.Nevertheless, some Republican campaign consultants believe that with just weeks to go till Election Day, even an hour of a candidate’s time is precious and should not be wasted in places where the outcome is not in doubt. Calling potential donors, calling staff or volunteers to offer encouragement, or even taking a nap would have been time better spent, according to Texas-based consultant Matt Mackowiak. Wednesday evening, Mackowiak said, Trump would have been better preparing for the “commander-in-chief” forum that was to begin just an hour later.Trump gave the delegates a lower-key version of his stump speech, focusing on how dismal much of upstate New York looks because of shut-down factories. “And there is no hope. There is no hope, other than if I become president,” he said, promising that a threat of 35 percent tariffs would bring jobs back from Mexico and overseas.Trump also went into great detail with an extended description of how he finished the Wollman Skating Rink in New York City decades ago ― how he brought in an engineer from Montreal to replace an earlier one from Miami (where, Trump said, no one knew anything about ice), how he replaced copper tubing with rubber hose, and how he laid the concrete in one continuous pour.“Lo and behold, shortly thereafter, there was ice,” he said to applause.Many leading conservatives have argued that Trump is not really a conservative, given his support for Democratic candidates through the years and his shifting views on a number of issues, including abortion.But Jim Kerr, a Manhattan delegate to the convention, said Trump’s politics were right in line with conservatism as New York conservatives understand it. “He’s a conservative in the sense that the conservative party in New York is more of a small business party,” Kerr said, adding that Trump’s experiences through the years coping with government regulations let him understand what main-street businesses deal with every day. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

4,QUEER VOICES,New Season Brings New Challenges For This Up-And-Coming Composer,Curtis M.

Van Dyke returns to The Duplex, which is located in Manhattan’s West Village, with cellist Allison Seidner for “A Beer and A Song” on Sept. 12. Joining the pair will be Broadway’s Katie Rose Clarke, whose résumé includes “Wicked” and “The Light in the Piazza.” The evening’s set will feature mostly new material, as well as songs from Van Dyke’s two “pop-theater” EPs, “Chasing The Day” and “A View of the River.” (Check out a video for one of his new songs, “The Snowman,” above) “September always feels like the beginning of a new year in theater,” he told The Huffington Post by phone from Seattle, where a production of “Writing Kevin Taylor,” a musical he co-wrote with Josh Halloway, was being presented in August. Van Dyke is best known to Broadway audiences as the musical director of the Tony-winning musical, “Kinky Boots.” Meanwhile, his work as a songwriter has been showcased on recent albums by Annaleigh Ashford and Matt Doyle, as well as other established performers. Despite this, Van Dyke admitted to having a few pre-show jitters before his Sept. 12 show simply because he’s rarely taken to the microphone himself over the years. He even joked that the evening’s title was borne out of this anxiety, noting, “Hopefully people will get so drunk they won’t remember the sound of my singing voice the next morning.” Van Dyke’s remarks, of course, were clearly meant in jest. Meanwhile, the venue itself has personal significance, too. “The first show I ever did was at The Duplex, which was about 10 years ago,” he said. “It feels very homey to me, because that’s where I first started sharing my work.”No doubt the night will be a sweet return for this up-and-coming composer. Will Van Dyke and Allison Seidner will perform “A Beer And A Song” at New York’s The Duplex on Sept. 12, along with special guest Katie Rose Clarke. Head here for more details. "
5,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump Proved He's Not Qualified To Be President,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-trump-not-qualified_us_57d16341e4b06a74c9f2d196,“What would Ronald Reagan say about a Republican nominee who attacks American generals and heaps praise on Russia’s president?” she asked.,2016-09-08,"Hillary Clinton speaks during the NBC News Commander-in-Chief forum on September 7, 2016 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d17d401700002430c78772.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton says that Donald Trump’s failure to spell out a plan to defeat the self-described Islamic State is “not only dangerous but should be disqualifying” for the office of the presidency.During NBC’s Commander-In-Chief forum on Wednesday night ― the first event featuring both presidential candidates in question-and-answer sessions on national security ― Trump struggled to give a clear answer on his strategy to beat ISIS, claiming he both did and did not have a plan after more than a year of claiming he had a secret strategy for taking on the terrorist group.“Last night was yet another test, and Donald Trump failed yet again,” Clinton said Thursday morning, in what was her first formal press conference in 278 days. She argued that Trump’s inability to offer a clear plan to beat ISIS, along with his comments denigrating American armed forces and praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, offered more proof that he was “temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be commander in chief.”“That’s just not unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country and commander in chief. It is scary because it suggests he’ll let Putin do whatever he wants to do, and then make excuses for him,” Clinton told reporters. “What would Ronald Reagan say about a Republican nominee who attacks American generals and heaps praise on Russia’s president?”She added that every Republican in office should be asked if they agree with the real estate mogul on his views of Putin and his comments about U.S. generals, who Trump said have been “reduced to rubble” under the Obama administration.Of Trump’s plan to take on ISIS, Clinton said “he still doesn’t have one.”In yet another bid to attract more Republicans to her campaign, the former secretary of state announced she would hold a “working session” on terrorism on Friday with a number of high-profile former national security officials, including retired U.S. Marine Corps Gen. John Allen, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, former Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Michael Morell, former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and former CIA Director David Petraeus.Jason Miller, Trump’s senior communications director, issued a statement denouncing Clinton’s remarks as “desperate attacks of a flailing campaign sinking in the polls, and characteristics of someone woefully unfit for the presidency of the United States.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
6,MEDIA,Moderators Challenging Candidates' Lies Isn't 'Opinion.' It's Journalism.,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-matthews-matt-lauer_us_57d16eace4b06a74c9f2e635,MSNBC's Chris Matthews suggests Matt Lauer would have appeared too opinionated if he'd pressed Donald Trump on Libya.,2016-09-08,Matt Lauer came under fire Wednesday for not challenging Donald Trump's false claims on Libya and Iraq.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d179db160000ef1bc01764.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As MSNBC’s Matt Lauer came under heavy criticism Wednesday night for his performance as moderator during the network’s Commander-in-Chief forum, his colleague Chris Matthews came to his defense.During that forum, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump trashed his Democratic opponent for supporting the 2011 U.S. intervention in Libya. Critics were incensed at Lauer for failing to point out that Trump himself had supported the intervention as well.This was Matthews’ argument: Had Lauer called out Trump on the inconsistency, it would have sounded like Lauer was expressing an opinion.Actually, no. He would have simply been practicing journalism. Trump has repeatedly claimed he was a staunch opponent of the Iraq War, which is not true. Lauer failed to challenge Trump on this lie as well ― even after Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, mentioned during the first half of the forum that the real estate developer had supported the invasion. Clinton also told Lauer prior to Trump’s appearance that “there’s no difference between my opponent and myself” on Libya and that “he’s on record extensively supporting intervention.” Which, indeed, he is.But when Trump criticized Clinton later at the forum for making a “terrible mistake” in Libya while secretary of state, and touted his own “great management talents” by comparison, Lauer failed to push back. Instead of pressing Trump on his actual position, Lauer switched to the more open-ended question, “Are you prepared?”During a panel discussion after the Wednesday night forum, MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell played a 2011 clip in which Trump said the U.S. “should go in” to Libya and suggested the military expedition would be “very easy and very quick.” (Go to 12:44 in the video below.) “How do you debate a presidential candidate who took the position we absolutely should go into Libya, go in hard, and now says he never did?” O’Donnell then asked Matthews. “No one’s really had to deal with that in a presidential debate before.”“Well, you have to call the guy a liar when you do that,” Matthews responded. “That’s the problem. That’s the difficult thing for Matt Lauer to do, because it sounds like an opinion. And you’re not supposed to have opinions in this business.”Journalists at establishment, non-partisan news organizations understandably want to avoid the perception that they’re biased, or that they’re injecting personal views in a context where they’re expected to be impartial. But in straining for some idealized notion of neutrality, they risk failing at their journalistic obligation to call out candidates when they’re being dishonest.Lauer’s reluctance to challenge Trump on Iraq and Libya does a disservice to viewers ― and voters. It also sets a troubling precedent ahead of the presidential and vice presidential debates, where one moderator has already said he won’t fact-check the candidates. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, who’ll moderate the third debate, said he expects Trump and Clinton to challenge one another’s claims, and that he doesn’t view the moderator’s role as being a “truth squad.”“NBC Nightly News” anchor Lester Holt, who will moderate the first presidential debate on Sept. 26 at Hofstra University, has not commented on his plans. Neither have ABC News’ chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz, CNN host Anderson Cooper or CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano.The moderator certainly shouldn’t take an outsize role as a third debater on stage when the two nominees meet in the coming weeks. But given Trump’s demonstrated willingness to state things that are not true (something Clinton does too, though nowhere near as often), the debates will be no more useful to voters than a “he said, she said” argument unless the candidates are held accountable somehow.For instance, if Clinton accurately observes that Trump is on the record supporting both Iraq and Libya ― which she did Wednesday ― a moderator could adjudicate by pointing out Trump’s past positions regardless of what he now claims.It’s unclear whether the moderators of the upcoming debates would actually do that in real time. News organizations will surely fact-check the candidates after the debates, as NBC News did with Trump’s Iraq claims on Wednesday night and Thursday morning. But the millions of viewers tuning in to the debates won’t necessarily catch these follow-up assessments.Politico chief political correspondent Glenn Thrush highlighted this problem after Wednesday’s forum:There’s another way to challenge the candidates on their positions without necessarily serving as a fact-checker responding to each misleading assertion or outright lie. Washington Post “Fact Checker” columnist Glenn Kessler agreed that Trump and Clinton should primarily challenge one another’s claims in the upcoming debates. But he suggested to The Huffington Post that the moderators try to frame questions that use fact-checks “as a way to get into questions of substance.”One example that Kessler offered Monday might have been useful to Lauer just two days later. “Mr. Trump, you have criticized Clinton for voting to authorize the war in Iraq. While you claim you opposed it, fact checkers have found no evidence of any public statements against it ― and in fact they have found evidence you also supported it,” Kessler said. “Clinton has apologized for her vote, saying it was a mistake. Will you apologize for trying to mislead the American public about your stance on the war?”Oh well. Maybe next time.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
7,ENTERTAINMENT,Hip-Hop Takes Center Stage In Sneakerhead Coming-Of-Age Film 'Kicks',Rahel Gebreyes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kicks-justin-tipping-hip-hop_us_57d098bbe4b06a74c9f281ed,Hip-hop music becomes the perfect storytelling device throughout the grim story.,2016-09-08,"Teenage Brandon stares down a group of men before they steal his shoes in the new movie, ""Kicks.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d0a2731800006b32bcff06.jpeg?ops=crop_406_248_3074_2288%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Almost every dimension of Justin Tipping’s full-length directorial debut, “Kicks,” embodies hip-hop. From the themes of inner-city sneaker culture and the perils of hyper-masculinity to the undeniable Bay Area-influenced soundtrack, the hip-hop thread runs throughout the film and helps tell the gritty story with surprising authenticity. In “Kicks,” a young curly-haired teen’s pride takes the form of retro red and black Air Jordans, which he scrapes to buy from a neighborhood hustler. A day later, his prized possessions slip away when an envious thug and his goons jump him and snatch the shoes. The brutal beatdown sets teenage Brandon on a dangerous journey from one rough Bay Area neighborhood to another, all in hopes of getting back the shoes and self-respect he so badly desires.That scene encompasses several themes of the film ― the value of status symbols like shoes, for example ― all of which are displayed over a meticulously produced soundtrack that pulls from classic hip-hop anthems and lesser-known Bay Area tracks. While the film has garnered solid reviews for its stunning camerawork and “commitment to detail,” viewers can find yet another layer of meaning in its music, which takes many forms throughout the movie. During the film, Brandon oftentimes retreats to his personal thoughts, which he communicates through hushed, poetic rap lyrics that spoken word artist Donté Clark specifically penned for the film.“Brandon’s character, I think internalizes a lot of his fear of the world though rapping in his head,” Tipping told The Huffington Post. “And for me, it was an interesting way and true to the world to have someone have internal voiceover, but it be rap lyrics because I know I definitely did that when I was a kid, I still do it. And so I was trying to use that as almost his security blanket.”After speaking with the budding filmmaker, it’s clear that Brandon, played by Jahking Guillory, is an extension of Tipping in more ways than one. Tipping co-wrote the script with Joshua Beirne-Golden and drew the film’s concept from his own experience getting jumped for his Nike Prestos in a dimly-lit parking lot at 16 years old. Tipping walked away from the fight barefoot with two black eyes and said the “defining moment” that occurred afterward taught him a lot about society’s understanding of manhood and its association with violence.“I remember specifically my older brother saying, ‘It’s OK, you’re a man now,’” the El Cerrito native recalled. That moment instilled a sense of pride in the then high schooler, but was followed with a pang of pain and confusion. “Why the hell is violence synonymous with becoming a man?” he asked. “Why is anger the only emotion we’re allowed to feel? ... It’s a harsh reality that I think all the kids in ‘Kicks’ and where I grew up, we were born into that.”That concept of masculinity repeatedly ties back into the film’s soundtrack. Tipping remembered specifically selecting Trill Youngins’ song “I Look Fly” for its brash, yet playful lyrics about ― to put it simply ― looking fresh to impress the ladies. “Their song plays in the background of the shoe store, where it’s like, ‘I look fly, don’t I? I look fly, don’t I?’ And it’s literally a song about where the character is emotionally in that moment, where the song is just about buying fresh clothes and shoes to get girls,” Tipping said.While the music in that scene took on a pointedly literal (and arguably contrived) meaning, Tipping’s other references are more multifaceted. Chapter titles drawn from the lyrics of Nas, Mac Dre, Tupac and others punctuate the film and have the dexterity to continue the overarching hip-hop themes while providing context for an upcoming scene.“Greek choruses and Greek plays would come out and state the themes and, to me, that was like the hip-hop Greek chorus,” he said. Tipping added that he chose lyrics that were both “universal” and “timeless” to help even the most novice hip-hop listener understand the next chapter of the story. For example the double entendre in the chapter title “Fresh To Death” was very deliberately ominous. “Everyone knows that something is going to happen,” he said. “I wanted people to start to feel the omniscient foreshadowing.”The chapter titles showcase lyrics from some of the biggest names in hip-hop, but the film’s soundtrack is filled with delectable tracks for those who prefer their music a little less mainstream. Aside from “C.R.E.A.M.,” which Tipping specifically wrote into the script, and “Party and Bullshit,” the soundtrack is comprised almost entirely of hip-hop gems from Bay Area stalwarts. Dave Steezy, Iamsu!, Roach Gigz and Oakland icon Mac Dre are all included, with a vibe-y Marc E. Bassy song that’s reminiscent of Dr. Dre’s G-Funk sound thrown in for good measure. Tipping worked closely with composer Brian Reiztell in threading the tracks with the film’s original score. The director said he crowdsourced potential songs from “friends of friends on Instagram” and his DJ buddies. Ultimately, Tipping hand-picked virtually every song that made it into the movie, so the heavy-hitting soundtrack ended up reflecting his own personal music taste. “I grew up a hip-hop head … It’s just part of who I am,” he said. “I didn’t think, ‘I should make a hip-hop movie.’ I was just like, ‘I want to tell the story and this feels like it’s coming from my personal experiences.’ I think maybe for selfish reasons too, where I think this is cool. And if I can make it work, why not?”“Kicks” hits theaters on Sept. 9."

Ultimately, Tipping hand-picked virtually every song that made it into the movie, so the heavy-hitting soundtrack ended up reflecting his own personal music taste. “I grew up a hip-hop head … It’s just part of who I am,” he said. “I didn’t think, ‘I should make a hip-hop movie.’ I was just like, ‘I want to tell the story and this feels like it’s coming from my personal experiences.’ I think maybe for selfish reasons too, where I think this is cool. And if I can make it work, why not?”“Kicks” hits theaters on Sept. 9."

Here, it's used as a sushi wrap. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d124a4160000ef1bc015e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Seaweed has a lot going for it. It’s an incredibly nutritious and, many say, tasty food. It’s also very versatile, with uses in fertilisers, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and even industrial products like adhesives and dyes. Seaweed farming has long been considered one of the most sustainable and environmentally benign forms of aquaculture as the marine algae requires no additional feed or fertilisers to grow, and can actually help clean the water it lives in. The industry has also been credited with creating both jobs and sources of sustenance in remote coastal areas of developing nations.But as the industry rapidly expands to cope with product demand, a United Nations report issued this month warns seaweed farming could pose significant environmental and economic risks to communities worldwide unless tighter regulations are put into place.Global seaweed production has ballooned in recent years. Seaweed farms now produce more than 25 million metric tonnes of the crop annually, according to the research from the United Nations University, the UN’s academic and research arm. The global value of the crop was $6.4 billion in 2014, surpassing the value of the world’s lemons and limes ― that’s up from almost zero in the 1970s. This growth has had many positive consequences, from providing jobs in developing and emerging countries, including China, Indonesia and the Philippines, to helping reduce overfishing in some regions, as coastal communities turn to seaweed farming as an alternative livelihood.But the “rapid expansion of any industry can result in unforeseen ecological and societal consequences,” and that is proving to be the case with seaweed as well, the report authors said.One Asian seaweed brought to Hawaii, for example, is killing off some coral reefs by outgrowing local corals. The spread of diseases and pests is another major concern.“There’s very little regulation” for seaweed in many nations, Elizabeth Cottier-Cook, the report’s lead author, told Reuters news agency. “You can take a plant from the Philippines and plant it in East Africa. There are pests, there are pathogens that can go along with that plant. There is no quarantine.”The report cites the example of one bacterial disease known as ice-ice that has spread with a red seaweed from the Philippines to seaweed farms in countries including Madagascar and Tanzania. In the Philippines alone, ice-ice caused industry losses estimated at $310 million from 2011 to 2013.Unregulated seaweed farming could also lead to other deleterious impacts, including the reduction of genetic diversity of native seaweed stocks due to mono-cropping, the report authors said.It could also result in a slew of bad farm management practices, such as placing cultivation nets too close together. This could increase the risk of disease transfer or the illegal use of algicides and pesticides which could have detrimental environmental consequences. “Rapidly increasing seaweed cultivation globally will be good for commerce and open up a range of new products, but we must also try to minimize any negative effects that this industry may have on coastal marine environments,” said Cottier-Cook in a news release. “The seaweed industry must be developed in a sustainable way that considers not just how to maximise profits but maintain the highest biosecurity standards to prevent the introduction of pests and disease. It will also be crucial to develop new indigenous disease-resistant strains of seaweed, wherever possible.”"

But when he was just starting out, he very much lived in the shadow of his famous father, Kirk Douglas.Perhaps even worse, Douglas did not have his father’s approval when he first starting acting, according to a new interview on ITV morning show “Lorraine.”“I remember the first show I did, he came back and he said, ‘Michael, you were absolutely terrible,’” Douglas said on the program. “And he was so relieved because he thought, ‘I don’t have to worry about my son becoming an actor. He was so bad.’ And I kind of stayed with it and kept working with it and a few shows later he came back and said, ‘Not bad.’”Not bad is right. At 71 years old, Douglas has earned accolades most actors only dream of ― two Oscars, three Golden Globes, one Emmy and countless other wins and nominations. But after being diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer in 2010, Douglas feared he would never work again.“When you are waiting to find out if you are cancer-free or not, you go through your chemo, your radiation, and you’ve lost a dramatic amount of weight,” the actor said, People reported. “And once this is all processed, once this is all done, there is that moment you go back in to be tested and all that to find out whether you’re in good shape or not. So sure, there is always a moment.”Though Douglas has worked on many films since his diagnosis ― and he is now cancer-free ― the actor admits the scare affected his career. “If you’ve had a cancer bout, you don’t take time for granted. You kind of choose more selectively how you are going to spend your time,” he said. To watch the rest of Douglas’ ITV interview, head here."

Nearly a third said the situation is about the same. This is the highest concern has been since 2002. Concern was lowest in February 2008. There’s a big partisan divide, though.

A March headline from The Huffington Post helped perpetuate the idea: “Donald Trump’s Working-Class Appeal Is Starting To Freak Out Labor Unions.”The AFL-CIO says not to buy it.On Wednesday, the nation’s largest union federation took the unusual step of releasing some of its internal polling numbers on the general election. In its recent poll of union members in five battleground states ― Florida, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ― Trump’s support came in at 36 percent, the AFL-CIO said.That’s a drop from 41 percent in the same states in mid-June, according to the federation.A few caveats: The AFL-CIO only disclosed the numbers noted above. It didn’t release the full poll results, including union members’ support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.The group also doesn’t indicate how many of the union members polled were Democrats or Republicans. If Trump held 36 percent of an overwhelmingly Democratic pool, then he isn’t doing badly at all. On the other hand, if the poll included a large share of Republicans, then the numbers don’t bode well for him.Michael Podhorzer, the AFL-CIO’s political director, said the federation rarely shares its internal numbers with the press, but in this case, they thought an exception was warranted.“There are so many stories that bind one or two big Trump supporters who [are union members] and build their story around that with no data,” Podhorzer explained. “We really think it’s important for people to understand that Trump may have excited some union members more than previous Republican candidates, but he hasn’t extended the number of union members who support him, despite what he claims. That’s borne out by our internal polling.”He attributes declining support for Trump partly to the federation’s own outreach to its members. The AFL-CIO has been calling union houses and sending out flyers painting Trump as a businessman who stiffs workers, relies on overseas labor and thinks wages are too high. “We have a lot of credibility with members,” Podhorzer said.Union members and their families tend to reflect the general population more than a lot of people assume, both politically and demographically. In several past elections, around 40 percent of union households voted for the Republican presidential candidate, according to exit polls. And rather than being the monolithic white, male bloc that many people picture, union members are increasingly women and people of color. Black workers are actually more likely to be union members than white ones.In other words, “union members” are a complicated lot. And while Trump may insist he has union voters in hand ― “their members will be voting for me in much larger numbers,” the candidate boasted when the AFL-CIO endorsed Clinton ― the AFL-CIO claims he is doing no better among its members than former GOP nominee Mitt Romney was at this point in 2012.“There’s no basis for the idea that Trump is making inroads in the union community,” Podhorzer said. “Quite the contrary.”Eric Hauser, an AFL-CIO spokesman, said the union federation plans to kick off its final election sprint this coming Saturday, with events in Missouri, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida and North Carolina. That includes door-to-door canvassing and heavy phone-banking in support of Clinton. The federation’s president, Richard Trumka, will be campaigning in Pennsylvania next week and Ohio the following week. As HuffPost recently reported, the AFL-CIO’s non-union arm, Working America, has been canvassing heavily in those two states to counter Trump’s appeal in the Rust Belt. “He’s laying claim to a voting bloc which is not uniform anyway, but in a way a Republican candidate never has,” Hauser said of Trump’s proclamations about his union support. “So we’re going directly at that, making the case that this is not a man on your side, this is not someone who will stand up for you.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

KARE11 news anchor Jana Shortal dedicated her program on Tuesday to the case of Jacob Wetterling, whose killer had just confessed to the 1989 murder and revealed the location of the 11-year-old’s remains. Wetterling’s disappearance was a long-standing mystery in Minnesota, and the killer’s confession is a major story, to say the least. But to Cheryl Johnson, a Star Tribune columnist who writes for the Minnesota newspaper under the name C.J., the real headline was Shortal’s supposedly inappropriate choice of pants.In Johnson’s column Wednesday night, she slammed Shortal for wearing skinny jeans and accused her of prioritizing “hipness” over “one of the biggest, saddest stories in Minnesota history.”“She looked great from the waist up in a polka-dot shirt and cool blazer, but the skinny jeans did not work,” Johnson wrote. “I was among a number of media types who found them inappropriate and, given the gravity of the day’s subject matter, downright jarring.”Media outlets, and even Star Tribune employees, called Johnson’s piece inappropriate and deeply ironic, given that she was accusing Shortal of disrespecting an important story by caring too much about fashion. In a statement, Shortal called the columnist ― who has a history of obsessing over women’s appearances in media ― a “bully with the keyboard who took this night, this story, and made [it] into gossip about my pants.” The Star Tribune several hours later apologized for the op-end (and to Shortal) and has since scrubbed the offending entry from its website.Shortal accepted the paper’s apology, but explained in her statement the pain of having Johnson’s column divert attention from a story Shortal has cared about for years.“I went on the air,” she wrote. “I did my best. I gave that newscast every single shred of hope and love I had for Jacob. For his family. And for every single one of you who was hurting. I left everything I had on that newsroom floor.”Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The column was particularly offensive given the importance of the Wetterling case to an entire generation of Minnesotans. “This case was the most talked-about cold case in Minnesota history,” Shortal told The Huffington Post on Thursday. “It’s the one case everyone wanted to see solved in their lifetime. And after 27 years, a lot of people were wondering if that would ever happen.” “That case robbed small-town Minnesota of its innocence in a way I’ve never seen,” she went on. “People kept their porch lights on for 27 years, because that was the universal symbol to Jacob that he could come home.”University of Maryland Professor Jo Paoletti, who studies the history of fashion, said Johnson’s now-deleted column showed a stubborn adherence to gender and fashion norms that haven’t been relevant since the 1960s.“Has anyone ever complained about a male anchor wearing too bright a tie when he’s reporting sad news?” Paoletti said. “For women, it’s always ‘They’re too dowdy, they’re too masculine, they’re too sexy.’ They’re always ‘too’ something.” Paoletti said the “enforcers” of these expectations are often other women, and that “women really dress to please other women, to avoid that critique.”But the fact that “anchorpeople tend to be kind of generic-looking” is no justification for criticizing someone with a more unique style, she noted. “The irony of the op-ed is that [Johnson] said ‘The way she looks is trivializing the story,’” Paoletti said. “But no. The way you’re writing is trivializing it.”"

On Thursday, the magazine republished the article with an editor’s note explaining that “the Iraq War began in March 2003, more than a year before this story ran, thus nullifying Trump’s timeline.”In his speech, Trump also claimed that he could have captured al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.Trump’s insistence that he immediately opposed the 2003 invasion is one of his most oft-repeated lies: He also brought it up on Wednesday night during an NBC forum on national security. Moderator Matt Lauer came under widespread scrutiny for not pushing back on Trump’s false comments.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
21,BLACK VOICES,Here's What Airbnb Is Doing To Fix Its Discrimination Problem,Taryn Finley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/airbnb-new-policy-discrimination_us_57d0769ae4b0a48094a75cf2,The company has created a new policy after months of complaints from its black users.,2016-09-08,Airbnb is getting serious about discrimination allegations.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d188011600009e26c017ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Airbnb is starting to take the necessary steps to address the housing discrimination issues its users of color have expressed they often face on the platform. After the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack gained popularity in May, the home-sharing company faced damning backlash from its users and activists who claimed that it didn’t do enough to rectify some of the racial issues and discriminatory practices its hosts have with prospective renters. Airbnb announced on Thursday that the pressure prompted the company to make policy changes.With the help of social justice group Color of Change, led by Rashad Robinson, Airbnb listed a number of actions that it would implement in a statement to The Huffington Post.These actions include de-emphasizing the use of user photos, providing assistance to users who report being discriminated against and hiring staff to exclusively “focus on ensuring inclusion and eliminating discrimination on the platform.” The company also plans on setting public diversity goals for its staff, which will include partnering with historically black colleges and universities for recruitment and focusing on supplier diversity. The 32-page report outlines the company’s new nondiscrimination policy which will go into effect Nov. 1. Hosts and guests would be asked to agree to the new policy which would request that they work with other users “regardless of race, religion, national origin, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or age,” according to the New York Times. “Corporations like Airbnb usher in exciting, market-changing innovations, but those disruptive technologies can also provide a platform for bad actors to engage in racial discrimination and other civil rights violations,” Robinson said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post. “Airbnb has made substantive policy changes in response to our demands. Color Of Change has been working to move the company towards these changes for a couple of years now, and we and others in the racial justice community will be closely monitoring this effort to gauge whether it brings an end to the dehumanizing treatment many people of color have experienced. ”These changes come after several months of criticism that the company’s policies weren’t suited to prevent discrimination. In May, a black Airbnb user, Gregory Seldon, said he was denied housing from a host when he used his real profile on the platform. He later requested to reserve the host’s home by creating two profiles imitating white men and was accepted. Seldon filed a lawsuit against the company for it allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act. Seldon’s story wasn’t an isolated incident. A 2014 Harvard study found that Airbnb users with distinctly African-American names were 16 percent “less likely to be accepted than identical guests with distinctively white names.”Though the company took some action to reprimand hosts for using racist practices, pressure increased after more and more stories of discrimination became widely shared. #AirbnbWhileBlack, the viral hashtag created by Quirtina Crittenden after she was declined several times by hosts when she requested a room in multiple Airbnb homes, prompted many people to share that they, too, had dealt with being denied housing by hosts because of the color of their skin.The widespread discrimination users claimed they faced made way for two alternative home-sharing start-ups, Innclusive and Noirbnb, which aimed to make their properties welcoming and accepting of everyone. Robinson praised activists and users for using their voices to hold Airbnb accountable which he said helped birth the new policy changes. “Airbnb’s announcement shows how organized black communities can hold multi-billion-dollar companies accountable and influence them to take definitive steps to end discriminatory practices and set new standards for diversity,” he said.Only time will tell if Airbnb’s changes will prevent discrimination from living on the platform going forward. But Robinson said Color of Change will “continue to advocate for additional efforts if needed.”"

Bob McDonnell speaks outside the Supreme Court in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors on Thursday dropped corruption charges against former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) and his wife, bringing to a close a case that had tarnished the once-rising star of the Republican Party.“After carefully considering the Supreme Court’s recent decision and the principles of federal prosecution, we have made the decision not to pursue the case further,” the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement, which also commended the prosecutors who tried the case.McDonnell reacted with gratitude toward the federal government, calling its announcement a “final day of vindication.”“Throughout this ordeal I have strongly proclaimed my innocence,” he said in a statement. “I would never do, nor consider doing, anything that would violate the trust of the citizens of Virginia I served during 22 years in state elected office. These wrongful convictions were based on a false narrative and incorrect law.”In June, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out McDonnell’s bribery convictions in a ruling that could make it tougher to prosecute politicians for corruption.The eight justices, liberals and conservatives alike, overturned McDonnell’s 2014 conviction, saying that his conduct fell short of a “official act” in exchange for a bribe as required for conviction under federal bribery law.“There is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that,” wrote Chief Justice John Roberts for a unanimous court. “But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Government’s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.”Jurors had convicted McDonnell for accepting $177,000 in luxury gifts and sweetheart loans to him and his wife Maureen McDonnell from a wealthy Richmond businessman seeking to promote a dietary supplement.He was sentenced to two years in prison but remained free pending appeal.The case was a rare instance of the nation’s highest court reviewing a high-level public official’s criminal conviction. When the case was heard in April, the court sent strong signs that it might side with McDonnell.During the hearing, Roberts pointed to a legal brief supporting McDonnell that was filed by a bipartisan group of government attorneys under both Republican and Democratic presidents ― who warned the Supreme Court that a broad reading of what counts as corruption could criminalize everyday politics.“I think it’s extraordinary that those people agree on anything,” Roberts said about the court filing. “To agree on something as sensitive as this and to be willing to put their names on something that says this ­­cannot be prosecuted conduct — I think it’s extraordinary.”The court sent the case back to lower courts to determine if there was sufficient evidence for a jury to convict McDonnell, which had kept alive the possibility of a new trial.McDonnell served as governor from 2010 to 2014 and once was considered as a possible U.S. vice presidential candidate. His wife was convicted in a separate trial and given a one-year sentence but remained free while pursuing a separate appeal.The Supreme Court ruling effectively applied to Maureen McDonnell too, meaning that her conviction also had to be tossed out. Her attorney was grateful for the government’s decision.“We thank the Department of Justice for the care with which they reviewed the case,” said attorney William Burck in a statement. “We are thrilled and thankful that Maureen can now move on with her life.”Noel Francisco, who represented Bob McDonnell before the Supreme Court, told The National Law Journal on Thursday that he was “absolutely delighted” for his client and that he planned to celebrate by enjoying some scotch ― the same drink he poured himself in June after the high court ruled.McDonnell, for his part, responded in a more spiritual tone and said he’d now use this moment to consider life beyond politics.“I have begun to consider how I might repurpose my life for further service to my fellow man outside of elected office. Polls and politics no longer seem that important. People and policies are,” he said in his statement. Cristian Farias reported from New York. This article has been updated with reactions from Bob McDonnell and one of his lawyers."

Rina Patel of Interlaken, New York, was standing on Carnival Ecstasy’s 11th deck around 2:30 a.m. when the incident happened, the Coast Guard said in a statement. She was wearing a white dress with pink floral print. The cruise company said she was seen “jumping overboard,” according to a statement obtained by The Huffington Post.“Man overboard procedures were initiated immediately along with notification to the U.S. Coast Guard,” the statement says. “The company’s CareTeam is providing assistance and support to the missing guest’s family and our thoughts and prayers are with her and her family and loved ones during this difficult time.”The ship was traveling southwest of Freeport, Bahamas, when Patel went overboard. Some passengers said they were awakened to a ship-wide alert announcing the emergency.“It was one of those surreal things where it came on and they said it and you had to stop and think, ‘Did they just say man overboard?’ And then they repeated it four more times,” passenger Shannon Parks told CNN.Parks, of Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, tweeted out photos of small planes carrying out a search just after daybreak. She also described her own heartbreak after seeing the lost passenger’s family.The search efforts have included a Coast Guard Air Station Miami MH-65 Dolphin helicopter crew, an Air Station Miami HC-144 Ocean Sentry airplane crew and the Coast Guard Cutter Gannet crew, the Coast Guard said.The ship is expected to dock in Charleston, South Carolina, on Thursday.Carnival did not immediately respond to a request for further comment."

Opponents of such bans have decried them as sexist and Islamophobic. Applause erupted as Hollande encouraged tolerance and acceptance of Islam and all other religions, especially in the wake of recent terror attacks in France that have given rise to domestic tension and fear-mongering.“The French Constitution is not a flexible text with ellipses or parentheses ... We must guarantee security without giving up on living how we want to live,” Hollande said. “I will not let [fundamentalists] test the limit of the republic, and I will not give them any excuse to stigmatize Muslims, either.”Hollande went on to promise that he would protect France’s image and influence “over the coming months or coming years,” which some have interpreted as the unpopular leader’s first major hint at a re-election bid. His four-year presidency has been marred by several divisive issues, including multiple terrorist attacks and the contentious burkini debate.Dozens of French towns outlawed burkinis on municipal beaches this summer, and many continue to do so even after France’s highest administrative court ruled that such policies violate civil liberties. Women who defied the bans have been fined and even forced to undress in public.The controversy has engulfed political and public discourse in France, polarizing national leaders and even triggering protests beyond French borders.French Prime Minister Manuel Valls spoke out against burkinis in August, saying wearing them is “not compatible with the values of the French Republic.” Former President Nicolas Sarkozy, whom Hollande will oppose should he seek re-election in 2017, has also been highly critical of the swimwear.Burkinis “imprison women behind fabric,” suggested Sarkozy, who called to ban them at a national level and, along with Valls, expressed an interest in prohibiting Muslim veils in universities.But Hollande emphasized the importance of unity, compassion and other values intrinsic to French society in his address: “Here again, history is teaching us that forgetting our principles makes the world unhappier, but no safer,” he asserted. “Democracy will be stronger than the barbarism that has declared war on us.”"

Brazil’s real and main stock index have gained nearly 3 percent since Rousseff’s ouster, even as a new corruption scandal hit the government last week.His team is expected to oversee a recovery of Brazil’s economy, bogged down in its worst recession in 80 years, but economists do not predict a robust turnaround over the next 12 months.Investors also expect Temer to push through unpopular and difficult reforms of the country’s bloated pension system, burdensome tax code and inflexible labor laws."

Possibly a product of slave labor. Those snack packs of almonds? Have you heard how much water those need?! And let’s not even get into a debate about organic eggs.As food critic Adam Platt wrote in a Grub Street story this summer, we as consumers have more information available concerning the food we are buying and eating than perhaps ever before. But all those certifications and labels, conflicting academic studies and investigative reports make it difficult to keep track of which foods were sustainably and ethically sourced or not.That’s especially the case when you’re crunched for time in the grocery aisle.What’s an eater to do? We spoke with four different food ethics experts to learn how they handle it.Lauren Ornelas is the founder and executive director of the Food Empowerment Project. The Cotati, California-based food justice organization urges consumers to make informed choices about the foods they buy and avoid foods derived from animals abused on farms, unsustainable farming practices or unfair working conditions.“We encourage people to eat their ethics and not look at going to the grocery store and buying food as overwhelming when thinking of these dilemmas, but instead looking at it as an opportunity. It’s one more chance to make a difference,” Ornelas told HuffPost.But Ornelas, who eats a vegan diet and supports worker-led boycotts of the likes of Driscoll’s and Wendy’s, has sometimes struggled with food choices too.Ornelas said she used to take so much time deciding between her options in the produce aisle — locally-grown but not certified organic? organic, but grown and then shipped hundreds of miles away? — that her husband has taken over that part of their regular shopping trips.“Nobody is going to be perfect, but we can all do our part,” Ornelas added.Still, it’s clear even experts are not immune from what food writer Michael Pollan famously dubbed the “omnivore’s dilemma.”Andrew Chignell, a philosophy professor at Cornell University who teaches an ethics in eating course each spring, had a change of heart when he embraced a vegan diet five years ago. But he still identifies as more of a flexitarian when he’s been invited to someone’s home for a meal.He said it just doesn’t feel right to turn down his grandmother’s meatloaf or his 88-year-old Austrian friend’s signature Wienerschnitzel “just to make a point.”Chignell agreed that expecting perfection from eaters is unrealistic, because some of the issues implicit in the question of whether certain foods are ethical to eat or not — such as whether local food is genuinely better food miles-wise — remain unresolved. But other issues — concerning excessive cruelty to workers and animals, for example — are more difficult to debate.“I think we ask too much if we want people to understand all the empirical details here,” Chignell said. “I do think that it’s reasonable to think that some of the general ethical impulses are ones that every thinking person should share.”Further complicating ethical matters is the fact that some of the labels, certifications and marking slogans affixed to the foods consumers buy may not mean what some consumers think they mean.Just because a food is labeled “non-GMO,” for example, doesn’t mean it is organically grown, a fact apparently lost on some consumers. Further confusion abounds when it comes to foods that are labeled as “natural,” a distinction that has become so muddled in meaning that the FDA is getting involved. Sometimes it is key to question which details are omitted from how a food is labeled, said Jonathan Marks, an ethics professor at Penn State University. “We tend to assume that it is good to eat something that is labeled low in fat, sugar, or salt,” Marks told HuffPost. “But it may be high in something else that the label does not mention. Or it may be better to avoid this food for reasons other than health.”Another factor to consider is the affordability of food, as nutritious and ethically-sourced foods can sometimes be more expensive — or, in the case of food deserts, more difficult to find in the first place — than the alternative. There are, of course, tools available to help consumers navigate the jungle of conflicting food labels and purchase products in line with their personal ethics.The Marine Conservation Society offers a Good Fish Guide smartphone app that allows shoppers to choose sustainable seafood at the supermarket. And the Environmental Working Group’s Food Scores app helps shoppers identify products containing pesticides and chemical additives they wish to avoid.But no currently available tool can encapsulate the myriad of concerns — for animal welfare, the environment and worker’s rights, to name a few — that consumers might have.One new app, the namesake offering of the Brooklyn-based startup HowGood, pulls together information pertaining to a number of these ethical dilemmas and boils it all down to one rating. That rating is accessible through the startup’s app or via a shelf label currently showing up in a small but increasing number of retailers nationwide. Johns Hopkins University researchers are also working to create a new ethical food rating system that will cover a broad range of consumer concerns. The project is led by Alan Goldberg, an environmental health sciences professor. “It’s very hard for somebody that’s trying to do good to really carry that out,” Goldberg told HuffPost.While efforts like these will take some time to be completed or to proliferate, it remains up to consumers to educate themselves about the food they are eating and prioritize the information that they find.After all, this all comes back to the food we eat and feed our families each day — and it’s hard to think of an issue more important than that.“We spend a lot of time researching what computer or car to buy or what companies to invest in and we don’t take that same type of time to look into where our food is coming from or why it’s so cheap and who is paying the true cost of that labor,” Ornelas said. “It’s absolutely tough but not doing our best has a worse consequence.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

29,TASTE,Is There Any Food That's Totally Ethical To Eat? Here's What Experts Buy,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-ethics-what-experts-buy_us_57d05ebce4b06a74c9f22eab,"It's been called the ""omnivore's dilemma."" And nobody, not even an expert, is exempt from it.",2016-09-08,Finding sustainably-sourced seafood can be a particular challenge for consumers. Apps like the Marine Conservation Society's Good Fish Guide can help.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It seems no matter where you turn in the grocery store, there’s a “verboten” item at arm’s reach.That shrimp dip? Possibly a product of slave labor. Those snack packs of almonds? Have you heard how much water those need?! And let’s not even get into a debate about organic eggs.As food critic Adam Platt wrote in a Grub Street story this summer, we as consumers have more information available concerning the food we are buying and eating than perhaps ever before. But all those certifications and labels, conflicting academic studies and investigative reports make it difficult to keep track of which foods were sustainably and ethically sourced or not.That’s especially the case when you’re crunched for time in the grocery aisle.What’s an eater to do? We spoke with four different food ethics experts to learn how they handle it.Lauren Ornelas is the founder and executive director of the Food Empowerment Project. The Cotati, California-based food justice organization urges consumers to make informed choices about the foods they buy and avoid foods derived from animals abused on farms, unsustainable farming practices or unfair working conditions.“We encourage people to eat their ethics and not look at going to the grocery store and buying food as overwhelming when thinking of these dilemmas, but instead looking at it as an opportunity. It’s one more chance to make a difference,” Ornelas told HuffPost.But Ornelas, who eats a vegan diet and supports worker-led boycotts of the likes of Driscoll’s and Wendy’s, has sometimes struggled with food choices too.Ornelas said she used to take so much time deciding between her options in the produce aisle — locally-grown but not certified organic? organic, but grown and then shipped hundreds of miles away? — that her husband has taken over that part of their regular shopping trips.“Nobody is going to be perfect, but we can all do our part,” Ornelas added.Still, it’s clear even experts are not immune from what food writer Michael Pollan famously dubbed the “omnivore’s dilemma.”Andrew Chignell, a philosophy professor at Cornell University who teaches an ethics in eating course each spring, had a change of heart when he embraced a vegan diet five years ago. But he still identifies as more of a flexitarian when he’s been invited to someone’s home for a meal.He said it just doesn’t feel right to turn down his grandmother’s meatloaf or his 88-year-old Austrian friend’s signature Wienerschnitzel “just to make a point.”Chignell agreed that expecting perfection from eaters is unrealistic, because some of the issues implicit in the question of whether certain foods are ethical to eat or not — such as whether local food is genuinely better food miles-wise — remain unresolved. But other issues — concerning excessive cruelty to workers and animals, for example — are more difficult to debate.“I think we ask too much if we want people to understand all the empirical details here,” Chignell said. “I do think that it’s reasonable to think that some of the general ethical impulses are ones that every thinking person should share.”Further complicating ethical matters is the fact that some of the labels, certifications and marking slogans affixed to the foods consumers buy may not mean what some consumers think they mean.Just because a food is labeled “non-GMO,” for example, doesn’t mean it is organically grown, a fact apparently lost on some consumers. Further confusion abounds when it comes to foods that are labeled as “natural,” a distinction that has become so muddled in meaning that the FDA is getting involved. Sometimes it is key to question which details are omitted from how a food is labeled, said Jonathan Marks, an ethics professor at Penn State University. “We tend to assume that it is good to eat something that is labeled low in fat, sugar, or salt,” Marks told HuffPost. “But it may be high in something else that the label does not mention. Or it may be better to avoid this food for reasons other than health.”Another factor to consider is the affordability of food, as nutritious and ethically-sourced foods can sometimes be more expensive — or, in the case of food deserts, more difficult to find in the first place — than the alternative. There are, of course, tools available to help consumers navigate the jungle of conflicting food labels and purchase products in line with their personal ethics.The Marine Conservation Society offers a Good Fish Guide smartphone app that allows shoppers to choose sustainable seafood at the supermarket. And the Environmental Working Group’s Food Scores app helps shoppers identify products containing pesticides and chemical additives they wish to avoid.But no currently available tool can encapsulate the myriad of concerns — for animal welfare, the environment and worker’s rights, to name a few — that consumers might have.One new app, the namesake offering of the Brooklyn-based startup HowGood, pulls together information pertaining to a number of these ethical dilemmas and boils it all down to one rating. That rating is accessible through the startup’s app or via a shelf label currently showing up in a small but increasing number of retailers nationwide. Johns Hopkins University researchers are also working to create a new ethical food rating system that will cover a broad range of consumer concerns. The project is led by Alan Goldberg, an environmental health sciences professor. “It’s very hard for somebody that’s trying to do good to really carry that out,” Goldberg told HuffPost.While efforts like these will take some time to be completed or to proliferate, it remains up to consumers to educate themselves about the food they are eating and prioritize the information that they find.After all, this all comes back to the food we eat and feed our families each day — and it’s hard to think of an issue more important than that.“We spend a lot of time researching what computer or car to buy or what companies to invest in and we don’t take that same type of time to look into where our food is coming from or why it’s so cheap and who is paying the true cost of that labor,” Ornelas said. “It’s absolutely tough but not doing our best has a worse consequence.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

30,POLITICS,Gubernatorial Candidate Has Ties To Pastor Who Wrote Black Families Were 'Stronger' Under Slavery,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greg-gianforte-douglas-wilson-montana_us_57d19d76e4b03d2d45991adc,"Greg Gianforte, who is running for governor of Montana, is unfamiliar with these writings, according to his campaign.",2016-09-08,"Montana GOP gubernatorial candidate Greg Gianforte has ties to Douglas Wilson, a pastor who has controversial writings on women and African-Americans.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d1a0791600009e26c01877.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Republican candidate for governor of Montana has ties to Douglas Wilson, an Idaho pastor who once wrote, “one could argue that the black family has never been stronger than it was under slavery,” and maintains that women are “created to be responsive and dependent to a man.” Greg Gianforte, the wealthy technology entrepreneur who’s challenging incumbent Steve Bullock (D) for the Montana governor’s seat, served with Wilson on the board of the Association of Classical and Christian Schools, which the pastor co-founded. (Wilson is an ex officio member of the board, which means he doesn’t vote.) Both men spoke at the group’s conferences in 2014 and 2015. Gianforte praised Wilson at the 2014 conference. “We have been Classical Christian from day one ― 20 years,” he said. “And I really appreciate Douglas Wilson’s comments about, avoiding, you know, vision drift.”The Gianforte Family Foundation, a charitable organization that Gianforte and his wife established, gave more than $30,000 to ACCS between 2012 and 2014, according to filings. Gianforte remains the chairman and a permanent board member of Petra Academy, the Bozeman-based, ACCS-accredited school his son attended. (Craig Dunham, headmaster of Petra, said the school makes its own curricular choices. “We do not use Mr. Wilson’s book on slavery in our curriculum,” he added.) Gianforte “is unfamiliar with Mr. Wilson’s writings outside of their mutual involvement with ACCS,” Aaron Flint, a spokesman for his campaign, told The Huffington Post.Wilson’s writings on classical, Christian education inspired the formation of other schools, and he was involved in the effort to accredit them. But his views on slavery are so controversial that after learning about them in February, a Republican lawmaker in Tennessee withdrew a bill that would have helped ACCS. The Democrat who drew attention to Wilson’s views made claims that were “untrue and unfounded,” said ACCS President David Goodwin.Wilson and a co-author rewrote slavery’s violent history in a 1996 pamphlet called “Southern Slavery, As It Was.” They cite narratives that they claim show Southern slavery was “a life of plenty, of simple pleasures, of food, clothes, and good medical care,” and note that “one could argue that the black family has never been stronger than it was under slavery.” In the same document, they claim “feminists, in rebellion against God, invert the order of the home established by God. They do so in a way that seeks to rob women of their beauty in submission.” Goodwin said Wilson’s views on slavery are independent of the ACCS, and that the pastor only discussed education at conferences. “We would distance ourselves from him if we thought he were a racist or a friend of slavery,” Goodwin said. “Wilson, in our judgment, when we read his materials and try to assess these things, is making academic arguments, and as a pastor, we don’t want to censor him for things that are reasonable, if read carefully, interpretations of history that other people have had.” “We have multiple schools run, some of them by black individuals...I don’t think they’d be there if they really felt this was a racist movement,” he later added.Wilson wrote four of the 14 classical Christian education books ACCS recommends on its website. The site doesn’t mention the 1996 pamphlet, but it does recommend an education book by Confederate chaplain Robert Lewis Dabney, who wrote in his 1867 defense of slavery that black people are “morally inferior.” (Goodwin was not familiar with that work, but said Dabney’s thesis on education is “consistent with our view.”) Wilson and Gianforte appear to share educational goals, but are not close friends. Wilson told HuffPost that he would support Gianforte’s candidacy if he lived in Montana (he doesn’t), and described their relationship as “friendly at board meetings,” which he attends about once a year. He said that as far as his views on slavery go, “Greg and I never talked about any of that stuff.” Rather, meetings were focused on education. Wilson emphasized that he is glad slavery is gone, and pointed to his 2005 publication, in which he argued, “we were not trying to maintain that slavery in itself was a positive good...our central interest was in defending the integrity and applicability of the Scriptures.”  But Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, contends that ACCS “apparently remains the same extremist organization that it was when Doug Wilson founded it.” He pointed to the fact that the association still carries some of Wilson’s writings, adding, “Wilson has unbelievably retrograde ideas about women.” “I do not think they could possibly have any factual basis for their assertion,” Goodwin said in an email. Wilson called SPLC “an organization of leftist hacks.” When asked by HuffPost whether he still believes, as SPLC noted, that “women are created to be dependent and responsive to a man,” he said, “absolutely,” but added, “God created them to be mutually interdependent.” "
31,POLITICS,Lawmakers Launch Last-Minute Bid To Block Billion-Dollar Arms Sale To Saudi Arabia,Michael McAuliff and Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawmakers-arms-sales-yemen_us_57d1cd40e4b03d2d459988a1,They say the U.S. shouldn't continue to be complicit in mounting civilian casualties in Yemen.,2016-09-08,"A hospital operated by Doctors Without Borders on Aug. 16, 2016, the day after the Saudi-led coalition reportedly hit it in an airstrike.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d1cdde160000fe26c0194e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A bipartisan group of senators thinks maybe it’s not such a great idea for the United States to back Saudi Arabia’s slaughter of civilians in war-torn Yemen, and are mounting a rare bid to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to the U.S. ally.Most of the approximately 10,000 civilian deaths in Yemen were caused by indiscriminate airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition that relies on the U.S. for a supply of weapons, targeting assistance and logistical and intelligence support, the United Nations human rights office said last month. The White House notified lawmakers of its intent to replenish the Saudis’ supply of machine guns, armored vehicles and tanks ― some of which have been destroyed in the conflict in Yemen ― in August, while members of Congress were back in their home districts on recess. Congress has 30 days to consider proposed arms sales, so the White House’s timing meant that lawmakers had little time to act after returning to Washington this week. The lawmakers, led by Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), introduced a resolution of disapproval on Thursday to block the weapons sale. They argue that the Saudis’ war against Houthi insurgents in Yemen harms U.S. national security by creating a chaotic environment that allows the al Qaeda unit there to strengthen. The Saudis have long been a U.S. ally in the war against al Qaeda and associated groups ― but in Yemen, their primary target is the Houthi insurgent group, which the Saudis see as closely aligned with Iran. Paul and Murphy introduced legislation earlier this year that would place stricter conditions on U.S. military support to Saudi Arabia ― but GovTrack gives it a 2 percent chance of becoming law. This time, they are joined by Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) in offering the resolution under a seldom-exercised 1976 law that allows Congress to vote against such arms sales if individual lawmakers object.“Selling $1.15 billion in tanks, guns, ammunition, and more to a country with a poor human rights record embroiled in a bitter war is a recipe for disaster and an escalation of an ongoing arms race in the region,” Paul said in a statement.“Saudi Arabia is an important partner, but their war in Yemen, funded by the U.S., has become a disaster that is making our country less safe every day,” said Murphy. “Thousands of civilians are being killed, and terrorist groups inside the country, like al Qaeda and ISIS, are getting stronger. Until the Saudis conduct changes, the U.S. should put a pause on further arms sales.”Although the 1976 Arms Export Control Act gives lawmakers the ability to expedite votes against specific arms sales, it’s a difficult route to take. In this case, many members of Congress see Saudi Arabia as a valuable ally they don’t want to upset, so there may not be enough votes to pass in either chamber. But there are mounting signs that lawmakers are growing frustrated with their Gulf ally. Sixty-four members in the House signed a bipartisan letter last month urging the Obama administration to postpone the planned weapons sale. “Amnesty International has documented at least 33 unlawful airstrikes by the Saudi-Arabia-led coalition across Yemen that appear to have deliberately targeted civilians and civilian facilities, such as hospitals, schools, markets, and places of worship. These attacks may amount to war crimes,” they wrote in the letter.Another nonprofit human rights organization, Human Rights Watch, questioned the timing of the Obama administration’s decision to restock the Saudis with weapons to use in Yemen. The same week the White House notified Congress of the sale, the Saudi-coalition bombed a factory, killing 10 civilians, the group noted in a statement. Shortly after, an airstrike partially destroyed a Doctors Without Borders-supported hospital, killing 19. Even if there are enough votes to pass the disapproval resolution, Obama can still veto it. It would then take two-thirds of the votes in each chamber to stop the sale.Still, the legislative gambit is another sign of Congress’ growing discomfort with White House foreign policy, regardless of party. And the move may also force a debate that makes Americans think more deeply about the actions their nation supports around the world.“I believe it is our responsibility as stewards of our constituents’ interests to have a public discussion and debate on the merits ― or lack thereof ― of our involvement in this conflict and the broader Middle East,” Lee said. “This presents Congress with an opportunity to prove we can do our jobs in a bipartisan manner and put the safety and security of the American people first.”Read the legislation here:"

Laszlo was directly behind the police officers and filmed migrants as they ran.“While filming she kicked a young man in the shin with a swift kick of the sole of her right foot, and also kicked young girl around the knee with her right foot,” the prosecutors said in a statement.There was no evidence of a racially motivated hate crime, they added.Laszlo was not immediately reachable for comment. Last year she told the daily Magyar Nemzet that she felt remorse over what had happened.“I am practically in shock from what I did, and what was done to me,” Laszlo said. “I am not heartless (or) racist... I am a woman, a mother of small children, who has since lost her job, and who made a bad decision in panic.”Prosecutors said she had not kicked a man carrying a small child, one of the accusations she had faced during last year’s online furor.“(Laszlo) kicked toward a man carrying a child in his hands, but the kick did not reach the man. The man carrying the child still fell, because... one of the policemen tried to catch and restrain him, and he lost his balance as he broke free.”The man, a soccer coach named Osama Abdul Mohsen, went on to Spain where a sports school offered to find him work."
33,POLITICS,Matt Lauer Lets Donald Trump Get Away With Iraq War Lie,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matt-lauer-donald-trump-iraq-war-lie_us_57d0b87ce4b0a48094a78bd3,It's been nearly seven months since audio surfaced proving Trump's 2002 support of the Iraq War.,2016-09-08,Matt Lauer is the latest reporter to let Donald Trump get away with claiming he has always been opposed to invading Iraq. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d0b43e1700002430c7850e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Of all the lies Donald Trump likes to tell while running for president, the one about being an early opponent of the 2003 Iraq War may be his favorite. Despite well-documented evidence that the casino mogul spoke in support of the ill-fated war in the lead-up to the invasion, reporters have repeatedly let the Republican presidential candidate tell a revisionist version of his past stance without pushing back on the claim. That sequence repeated itself on Wednesday night during NBC’s televised town hall, the first event featuring the two presidential candidates in back-to-back question-and-answer sessions. When it was Trump’s turn, NBC’s Matt Lauer asked the Republican candidate what about his past experiences has prepared him to be the country’s commander in chief. Trump followed a familiar routine of dodging the question, offering vague assurances of his success, and eventually, outright lying. “Well, I think the main thing is, I have great judgment. I have good judgment. I know what’s going on. I’ve called so many of the shots. And I happened to hear Hillary Clinton say that I was not against the war in Iraq. I was totally against the war in Iraq ― from ― you can look at Esquire magazine from ‘04, you can look at before that. I was against the war in Iraq because I said it would totally destabilize the Middle East, which it has. It has absolutely been a disastrous war.” Lauer, who is surely aware of the factual inaccuracy of Trump’s claim, could have pointed out that 2004 was after the invasion, and therefore more of an example of Monday-morning quarterbacking than good judgment. He could have pointed to earlier interviews in which Trump voiced support for the war. Or he could have asked the candidate for another example from before the 2003 start of the war.Instead, he just moved on to the next question. Buzzfeed’s Andrew Kaczynski was the first to uncover Trump’s earlier remarks about the war in Iraq. In 2000, Trump called for a “principled and tough” policy toward “outlaw” states like Iraq, Buzzfeed found. In 2002, Howard Stern asked Trump outright if he favored invading Iraq. “Yeah, I guess so,” Trump said at the time. “I wish the first time it was done correctly.” By 2004 it had become clear that ousting Iraq’s dictator Saddam Hussein was only the first part of a protracted U.S. military effort there, and Trump was offering a new view on the invasion. In August 2004 he told Esquire’s Cal Fussman: “Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we’re in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the county? C’mon. Two minutes after we leave, there’s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he’ll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn’t have.”Lauer is not the first reporter to let Trump get away with his revisionist account of his early stance on the Iraq War. Buzzfeed later reported that several major news outlets ― CNN, Fox, MSNBC, NBC, CBS, Bloomberg, the New York Times and the Washington Post ― have, on at least one occasion, offered a platform for Trump to insist he was always against the Iraq War without correcting the candidate. This is no small oversight. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton failed to secure the Democratic party’s presidential nomination in 2008, in part, because she voted for the disastrous war that her opponent, Barack Obama, had opposed as a senator. In this election, voters don’t have the option of electing a candidate who demonstrated better judgment about whether to invade Iraq. But during the town hall on Wednesday, Clinton owned up to her miscalculation on the Iraq War ― and reminded voters of her opponent’s refusal to do so.  “I have taken responsibility for my decision,” Clinton said. “He refuses to take responsibility for his support ― that is a judgment issue.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is aserial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Ray Albers, who had worked as an officer in nearby St. Ann for two decades, was part of the chaotic police response to the unrest in Ferguson in August 2014. Officers from more than 50 different law enforcement agencies were brought in to deal with the protests after unarmed teen Michael Brown was killed.Albers’ misconduct was undeniable: A video of him raising his gun on Aug. 19, 2014, and threatening to “kill” individuals filming his actions went viral, and he was forced to resign from the St. Ann Police Department that month. When a livestreamer known as Rebelutionary Z asked for his name, Albers had replied, “Go fuck yourself.”Now, Missouri’s Administrative Hearing Commission has ruled that Albers’ wrongdoing was sufficiently egregious that he can be disciplined by state authorities.The state Department of Public Safety has cause to discipline Albers for “committing the criminal offenses of assault and harassment” and for “committing an act while on duty involving reckless disregard and moral turpitude,” the commission ruled last month. The Huffington Post obtained a copy of the decision this week after it was cleared for public release.The Administrative Hearing Commission has the power to find that a police officer can be penalized for crimes even if criminal charges have not been filed.Since the commission’s role is to determine whether there is cause for discipline, not to dole it out, Albers’ case shifts back to the Department of Public Safety.The public safety director has the authority to “probate, suspend, or permanently revoke” a peace officer’s license. The department will schedule a disciplinary hearing within 30 days once it receives formal notification of the finalized decision, a spokesman said.That decision is deeply critical of Albers’ actions. The Administrative Hearing Commission found that he “committed assault” when he pointed his weapon at members of the crowd and placed them “in apprehension of immediate physical injury.” It ruled that Albers “committed the criminal offense of harassment” by threatening to kill a protester while using offensive language and pointing a weapon. Albers also acted with “reckless disregard for public safety,” the commission held.“Given his prior experience as a police officer, we conclude that a reasonable person in Albers’ shoes would recognize an ‘unreasonable risk’ and a ‘high degree of probability’ that the safety of the public would or could be jeopardized if a weapon were pointed at persons in a crowd while threatening them,” the commission ruled.Thomas Eric Willis, the lead firearms instructor in St. Ann, had testified that an officer should only raise a weapon at a person when that person represents a direct threat and that officers should not scan a crowd with their weapon raised.The commission also stated, “Peace officers must be held to a high standard. The public trust and the criminal justice system require that peace officers do not violate the laws that guide them.”Albers can appeal the commission’s decision. At a hearing in the case last December, he said his life had been “ruined” by the incident.St. Ann, Albers’ onetime employer, is also under scrutiny as one of many cities in St. Louis County that funds its police department by writing an excessive number of tickets. Along with 12 other municipalities, it’s facing a class-action lawsuit over those practices.At the December hearing, Albers’ attorney Brandy B. Barth argued that the former officer had shown “great restraint.” She pointed out that photos of the Ferguson protests showed other officers directing their weapons at individuals or crowds posing no threat. The heavily criticized “overwatch” tactic ― that is, using the scope of one’s weapon to scan a crowd ― was employed even during peaceful daytime demonstrations.The commission ruled, however, that it was “not a defense” that other police officers may have done likewise.Barth did not respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment.Despite the widespread violations of protesters’ constitutional rights in Ferguson two years ago, Albers will likely be one of the only officers disciplined for misconduct.Mariah Stewart contributed reporting.

At a hearing in the case last December, he said his life had been “ruined” by the incident.St. Ann, Albers’ onetime employer, is also under scrutiny as one of many cities in St. Louis County that funds its police department by writing an excessive number of tickets. Along with 12 other municipalities, it’s facing a class-action lawsuit over those practices.At the December hearing, Albers’ attorney Brandy B. Barth argued that the former officer had shown “great restraint.” She pointed out that photos of the Ferguson protests showed other officers directing their weapons at individuals or crowds posing no threat. The heavily criticized “overwatch” tactic ― that is, using the scope of one’s weapon to scan a crowd ― was employed even during peaceful daytime demonstrations.The commission ruled, however, that it was “not a defense” that other police officers may have done likewise.Barth did not respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment.Despite the widespread violations of protesters’ constitutional rights in Ferguson two years ago, Albers will likely be one of the only officers disciplined for misconduct.Mariah Stewart contributed reporting.

He became Palestinian president in 2005.The documents cited by Remez did not give any indication of what role Abbas may have played for the KGB or the duration of his purported service as an agent.A Palestinian official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said that Abbas had served as an “official liaison with the Soviets, so he hardly needed to be a spy,” without elaborating.The official said any suggestion that the president was a spy was “absolutely absurd.”Adding to the intrigue, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, whom Putin has tasked with arranging the Moscow summit, served two stints in the Soviet embassy in Damascus between 1983 and 1994, covering the period in which Abbas was purportedly recruited.Bogdanov was in the area this week for meetings with Israeli and Palestinian officials.(Additional reporting by Luke Baker; Editing by Pravin Char)"
